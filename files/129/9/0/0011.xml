A further 412 authorities who have been authorised to go to tendercover 13-6 per cent, of the population, and the residue of 194 authorities covers5 per cent, of the population. The type plans specifications and bills of quantities,which have now been issued will put a number of these last authorities in aposition to advertise for tenders at an early date.A detailed statement of the position at the 31st March is shown in Annex A.In Scotland the 143 local authorities who have already had tenders approvedare the authorities of districts representing over 90 per cent, of the population ofScotland.Scottish figures are shown in Annex B.4. Use of Private Builders by Local Authorities.A Circular setting out the arrangements 1(a) to enable builders who own land to make it available for local authorities,and themselves erect houses on that land;(b) to enable the small house builder to build houses for local authorities atan agreed price;was issued to all local authorities in England and Wales on the 30th April.5. House Building Prices.A statement showing the range of tender prices for houses for which tendershave been approved in the period July 1945 up to the 28th February, 1946, is givenin Annex C. It will be seen from this statement that up to the end of Decemberprices tended to spread over a very wide range. During January and Februarythere is a much heavier concentration in the middle range, particularly between21s. and 23^.The changes in the average price per foot super of 3-bedroom houses in tenders-approved are shown below : SeptemberOctoberNovemberEnglandand Wales.

House on the 14th March, 69 local authorities have now agreed toaccept 14,944 of these houses, and serviced sites sufficient for 2,990 will be avail-able in April and May.Private House Building (other than rebuilding of war-destroyed houses).Position at the 31st March, 1946 : Houses underLicences       construction        Housesissued.

In order to ensure a proper balance between houses built for sale and houses for letting, I have instructed 161 outof the total of 1,469 authorities to issue no further licences without my expressconsent. Thirty-two of these 161 authorities were instructed to review licencesalready issued. A few authorities misinterpreted this instruction and purported to withdraw licences in respect of houses which were actually under construction.Steps have been taken to make it clear in those cases that this was not intended.9. Requisitioning.Requisitioned houses and flats held for residential purposes on behalf of local^&quot;authorities-3^,070./ (Scotland 1,322.)Flats and houses of 12 rooms or less still held by the Services and GovernmentDepartments 7,567.Ditto released between the 1st May, 1945, and the 25th February, 1946 25,244.10. Building Materials and Components.Particulars of the production, requirements and estimated future production capacity of the principal building materials and components are given in Annex E.I asked the Ministers of Labour and Works to let me know the steps whichthey are taking to increase the production of certain materials and componentsin short supply and a statement on this subject is given in Annex F, particulars of the labour employed being shown in Annex G. I am also concerned about future supplies of timber for the housing programme and I am in touch withthe President of the Board of Trade as to the possibilities of increasing supplies for all purposes, including housing.Assisted Travel Scheme.The introduction of an Assisted Travel Scheme has been discussed with bothsides of the Industry, who say that what is needed is the provision of transport facilities in particular areas, subsidised if necessary by the Government, rather[31766] B 2
than the mere payment of daily travelling expenses above a certain amount. TheMinistry of Labour&apos;s evidence is to the same effect. Treasury approval hasbeen secured and the final details are being discussed with the Industry.Transport of Materials.The Ministry of Transport report that on the information which has so far been made available to them as to anticipated production they do not foreseeany serious difficulty in the provision of transport facilities for essential building materials for housing up to the total quantities envisaged. They point out,however, that these movements are on commercial account and are uncontrolled;it is, therefore, impossible to forecast the flow of the traffic or to plan the movements ahead. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of transport is continuing the investigations into this matter which have already been under-taken and is examining with the Departments concerned whether any special measures are necessary in addition to those already available or in contemplation.The Minister of Supply has now agreed a scheme with the motor industry for supplying suitable vehicles to building contractors and to manufacturers ofbuilding materials from surplus stocks as well as from new production.Distribution of Materials.The scheme for giving priority in the supply of building materials and components to housing and other high priority building work is now in operation.A Circular was sent to local authorities in advance giving details of the schemeand the method of operation. The same Circular includes notes prepared inconjunction with the Ministry of Works of some of the more difficult materials,viz. : bricks, plaster-board, roofing slates and lead, with recommendations asto the methods of effecting economy and the use of alternative materials. Similarnotes on other materials are in preparation and will be issued to local authoritiesin the same series.11. Building Labour.The application of payment by results to permanent house building depends on agreement between the two sides of the Industry which has not so far beenforthcoming. In December last, when the building wage increase was settled,the two sides of the Industry announced the formation of a National joint production Council and that this Council would consider &quot;whether it is practicable to devise such a workable system of payment by results as would leadto a further reduction in building costs.&quot; The reference to costs is very important,as the special scheme of payment by results introduced during the war on workcovered by the Essential Work Order, while accelerating the completion of jobs, isthought to have increased their cost to some extent, and unless every care is takenthere is serious risk that the introduction of a payment by results scheme on the top of the now very adequate time rates, would increase instead of reduce thelabour cost of housebuilding. The problem is to fix targets which will provide areasonable incentive without increasing labour cost. This will be easier a littlelater on when conditions are more normal and the rate of output is no longerseriously retarded by the absence in the Services of a virile section of the labour force and by lack of supervision.Meanwhile, the National Joint Production Council of the Industry has made no appreciable progress yet towards the working out of a scheme of payment by results, but the Minister of Works proposes to meet the industry shortly to discuss with them how best to expedite the matter and, if necessary, to suggest to them forconsideration a scheme which is in an advanced stage of preparation in his own department.As regards demarcation, the Minister of Labour has been informed by theNational Federation of Building Trade Operatives that the InterchangeabilityAgreement between the Unions inside the Federation has been circulated to the branches from time to time and will be circulated again if necessary, and that theFederation^ Officers have power to come to agreements in relation to the matter.12. Release of Local Authority Staffs.The present position regarding the release of local government staffs is shownin Annex H. Requests for releases have greatly diminished but a few are still being received every week.

Owing to differences in classification it is not possible to relate the &quot; number of insured workers &quot; to the number of &quot; operatives employed.&quot;(c) A change has had to be made in the definition of the number of operatives employed onthe construction and repair (including war damage repairs) of factories, public utilities, &amp;c. Thenumber of operatives enjoyed at the 31st January, 1946, and the 28th February, 1946, on thepresent definition for item (8) were 263,450 and 266,000 respectively. The number employed atthe same date on war damage repairs to such premises (item 7) were 19,000 and 25,000 respectively.The numbers shown above as employed at the 31st July, 1945, for these two items are on thepresent definition and differ from the combined figure previously published.(d) Operatives engaged on repair both of unoccupied (./&apos;.c, severely damaged) war damagedhouses and upon repair of war damaged occupied houses.

Progress.The following table shows progress made from the 31st December, 1945, tothe 31st March, 1946 :-31st December, 31st March,Number of works producing finishedbricksNumber of further works actuallypreparing for productionLabour other than prisoners of warPrisoners of war employed in Brick-works     ............      445 1,998 (at 20th April)The monthly production of finished bricks in December was 114 million andin March 178,804,000.B. Interdepartmental Committee.The Interdepartmental Committee on Brickmaking, of which the Parlia-j mentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour is Chairman, has held three meetings.It has considered the information and suggestions thrown up at a Conference[the Ministry of Labour held of all the Labour Supply Inspectors speciallyj allocated to the manning-up of the brickyards. The Committee desire to obtainHa) the issue of a Directive by the Prime Minister that all matters concerned with[Brick Production should be treated with the very greatest urgency, and (b) theI provision of sufficient food to Prisoners-of-War working in brickyards to enableithem to work to maximum capacity, and these points are being pursued through&apos;the appropriate channels.[C. Derequisitioning of Brickworks.Out of 452 brick, tile and salt glazed pipe works which were requisitioned[during the war, 158 have been cleared and derequisitioned, a further 69 have[been cleared and the owners allowed to retake possession, although the formalities[of derequisitioning have not yet been completed. In 104 cases clearing of storedsgoods is in progress. In 15 works stored goods do not interfere with productionrand 29 works are derelict and cannot be put back into production. The balance?of 77 works is due for complete clearance by the 30th June, 1946, at the latest. It!c,an be defmitely stated that in general the retention of brickworks under Govern-ment requisition is no longer an obstacle to increased production.flD. Fuel Economy.The Minister of Works has calculated the coal requirements for brickmakingfailt June and December 1946 on the basis of the production target set to theindustry and has communicated the figures to the Ministry of Fuel and Power.   .The Chairman of the Technical Sub-Committee of the National BrickAdvisory Council states that no recommendations are available in the matter ofsecuring immediate economies in the use of fuel in brick production. Reductionin fuel consumption can, in general, only come as the result of long-term improve-irient in the equipment of brickyards.Every effort is being made to increase the output of Fletton bricks as theconsumption of fuel in the manufacture of this particular type of brick is littlemore than a quarter of that required for bricks of other varieties.E. Release of Labour.The question of the release of experienced brick makers from the Forces came before the Cabinet and was decided on the lines that Class B release should again be offered to all those who had refused it, with a strong appeal stressing theRational need. Those nominated by employers for release who continue to refuse[will be posted to brickyards in uniform on Service pay. The necessary instruc-tions have been issued.[31766] d 2
F. Use of Polish Labour.The question of the utilisation of Polish labour in the brickyards has beenconsidered by the Foreign Labour Committee and it has been decided that use should be made of the Poles as troops where possible. It is the view of theMinistry of Works that Polish units are likely to be of less use in brickworksthan German prisoners. Subject, however, to the view of the Trade unions concerned the Ministry of Works are prepared to consider their use especially if the vacancies for this form of labour outstrip the supply of German prisoners.In general, however, the Ministry of Works would like to have any experiencedbrickmakers amongst the Poles preferably as individual citizens. The ministry would also like unskilled Poles as individual civilians to fill particular vacancies in brickworks that cannot otherwise be filled. No decisions have yet been reached as to the use of the Poles as civilians and it seems doubtful whether any help from this direction can be expected in the immediate future.G. Training Scheme.A training scheme has been agreed by the Joint Industrial Council and isin operation. It is on the basis of training by employers in the brickyards underinspection by the Ministry of Labour and with financial assistance from it.JH-Cheese Alloxoance.The Minister of Labour has spoken to the Secretary of the Trades UnionsCongress Rationing and Prices Committee regarding the application for a specialcheese allowance to brick makers, and representatives are about to discuss thematter with the Ministry of Food.I. Imports from the Continent.Ministry of Works officials have visited Belgium. Their preliminary reportindicates that the equivalent of about 176 million English size bricks could be exported from that country during 1946. The price f.o.b. Antwerp is comparable with the price of English bricks ex-works in the Fletton-South-East coast area.Freightage rates are heavy and a substantial subsidy of the order of  500,000would have to be provided for these Belgian bricks to compete with English bricksin the Fletton-South-East coast area. This matter is being considered by ministers on the 8th Mayr.J. Price.The Joint Industrial Council for the Clay Industries have agreed on a basicwage increase of 2\d. an hour, together with payment for six National holidaysin the year. The Brick Industry have asked for increases in price to cover thewhole of this increase in wages. Many manufacturers are working on very smallmargins of profit if they are not actually incurring losses. It is essential to achieve maximum production of bricks in the shortest possible time. In thecircumstances there is no alternative to allowing an increase in price and theMinister of Works has, therefore, made Orders providing for increases in theprice of bricks, though he has discounted the increases asked for by the industry on account of stocks already held, increase in output and the fact that only twoof the six National holidays will occur between the coming into force of the wage increase and Christmas next. The increases asked for and those whichhave been allowed are as follows : Asked for per   Allowed per thousand.        thousand,s. d. s. d.Fletton...............      3   0 2   3Sand LimeStock    .........*Other Clay Bricks     .........      5   3 3   9* The 5s. 3(7. asked for included 9rf. in respect of a previous wage increase. This has notbeen allowed.It has been necessary to make a rapid decision on this as the wage increases are to come into force on the 6th May, but a fresh examination is being made ofbrick-production costs to enable maximum prices to be fixed in the light ofexisting circumstances.   In view&apos; of the number of firms involved this wi3   0 2   55   0 4   6
inevitably take some time, but the increases now provided for are intended only as a temporary measure until the results of the new investigation are available.The new price Orders also allow for an increase in the cost of transport. TheBrick Industry have represented that the existing margins allowed for this in theBrick Prices Orders are insufficient and the Ministry of Transport agree that thisis so. This matter also is being further investigated with the co-operation of theMinistry of Transport.Roofing Materials.The Minister of Works is appointing an officer who will live in North wales and whose sole duty will be to maintain contact with the Welsh slate industryand do everything possible to resolve difficulties which are hampering production.The Minister of Works is appointing a committee, under the Chairmanship ofSir Frederick Rees, Principal of the University of Wales, Cardiff, to enquire into the organisation, efficiency and attractiveness to labour of the Welsh slateindustry. Sir Frederick Rees was Chairman of the Welsh Industrial Reconstruc-tion Committee.The Scottish Development Council has instigated a very full enquiry intothe slate industry in Scotland, and copies of the report are now with the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Minister of Works. The report recommends the amalgamation of the pre-war Scottish slate quarries into a single merged company,with adequate management and possibly some State financial assistance. Theseproposals are now under consideration.The difficulties which confront the clay tile manufacturers in increasingproduction are precisely similar to those affecting the brick manufacturers, infact, in many cases bricks and tiles are produced in the same works. The tilemanufacturers are included in the special attack which is being made with theobject of stepping up production in the clay industries.Concrete tiles are adequate and cheap substitutes for clay tiles for the roofingof houses and were largely used before the war for that purpose. At the beginningof the year the concrete tile makers, who used highly mechanised productionunits, were producing at a very low level. Steps were taken to persuade them toincrease their output in anticipation of demand although their order books werear from full. They responded very satisfactorily and output is now steadily increasing. The Minister of Works hopes that it will be possible to meet allhousing demands.Iron Foundries.As regards Iron Castings the various steps which have been described fromtime to time at the Prime Minister&apos;s meetings, have resulted in an in-put in thenrst quarter of this year of 3,397 men into the 140 Foundries particularly con-cerned with the Housing Programme in regard to which figures are collected.To put this into scale, it should be mentioned that at the end of March their labour force was 16,013 and their vacancies 3.022. There is good ground to hopethat a further improvement will result from the joint agreement just reached in the Engineering Industry regarding the upgrading of foundry personnel,and steps have been taken to bring this specially to the notice of all concerned.The net gain, however, was only 1,814 as during these three months theirwastage was 1,583 or at the rate of a little under 4 per cent, per month. It mayivell be that this rate is abnormal and due to the departure of many war-timeecruits, and it is hoped that the impending report of the Chief Inspector of factories&apos; Committee on amenities in the Foundries will assist in its reduction.The suggested use of Italian labour in the Iron Foundries has been discussed by the Foreign Labour Committee of the Cabinet, and as a result the Ministerof Labour is approaching the Trade Unions concerned on Monday, the 6th May,egarding the possible retention here on a contract of sei-vice of Prisoners of war who are experienced foundrymen, and also regarding the possibility of importingfoundry workers from Italy.   So far, the Unions have opposed the suggestion.
