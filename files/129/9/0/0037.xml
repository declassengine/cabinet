(46) 18.76th May, 1946.MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND BOARD  OFTRADE WORKING PARTIESMeraorand.urn by the Lord President of the CouncilEarlier in&apos;the year the National Union of General and   .Municipal Workers nominated Mr, Mark Hewitson, M.P.,- as oneof their representatives on the Linoleum Working Party.      ThePresident of the Board of Trade took the view that there shouldbe no Members of Parliament on Working Parties, and the union were so informed.      The Union have, however, declined toaccept this ruling,  and there is a risk that if their point ishot met,, they may withdraw their other three nominees on theWorking Party..When this was reported to the President of the Board ofTrade in his absence in India, he asked that the matter shouldbe referred to the Prime Minister and myself.      I do not,however,, find myself in agreement with the President, and,with the concurrence of the Prime Minister, I thought that theissue which it raised was of such importance that in view ofthe difference of opinion the Cabinet should be given theopportunity of considering it.I am accordingly circulating herewith the minutes whichhave passed between the President and myself on this subject.  -I think that these bring out our respective points of viewsufficiently clearly.      As will be seen, I am only concernedwith the question whether nominations of Members of parliament by outside bodies, whether those of Unions or Employers, shouldbe accepted.      I am not suggesting that there should be anychange in the President&apos;s policy as far as the appointment of independent members of Working Parties is concerned.I confess that I, personally,  am still unconvinced bythe Presidents arguments,  and I should be glad to know whatmy colleagues think.HAM.Office of the Lord President of the Council,.S. W. 1.6th May,  1946.-.   .\COPY NO.CABINET

ANNEX II think we must he firm that we-cannot introduceMembers of Parliament into Working Parties.      It is contrary to the whole idea of their non-politicalcharacter and in addition it is quite impossible for members to be- away from their duties for 2 days a week -whatever the matters may be that are to be discussed inParliament.I should like this taken to the Lord president and Prime Minister for their decision -which I trustwill uphold my views.(Intld)  S.C.2/h/k6ANNEX IITREES k5 26th April, 192+6Personal for Sir Stafford Cripps from Lord President.Members of Parliament on Working Parties. - I have-read your Minute of the 2nd April, but I am afraid that Ido not share your conclusion.I myself have a good deal&apos;of sympathy with theUnion&apos;s point of view, particularly because I am afraid of anything which may tend needlessly to accentuate thedivergence between Trade Union leaders who are not inParliament and those who are.     As you know, I have some difficulty anyway in pressing the Trade Unions to give facilities for their officials to be in Parliament,  andthis is just the kind of thing to increase - the difficulty.-With all respect to you, I do not find yourarguments convincing.      Whether or not a Trade Union leaderis in Parliament there is no mistaking where he standspolitically, and without suggesting that the government itself should nominate Members of Parliament I do thinkthat both the trade unions and the employers&apos;  organisationsshould be free to nominate Members of Parliament if they wish to do so.     As regards your second point, I shouldhave thought this applied equally to other forms of publicservice, e.g. on Select Committees, not to mention privatecommitments.     Surely it is a matter which ought to beleft to Members to decide for themselves. -The Prime Minister has asked me to get yourreactions to this alternative approach, and if you are notpersuaded I will put the matter to him again with youfrcomments at once.

WOODS 1+028th April,  1946Following to the Lord President fromSir Stafford Cripps.Your TREES 45-1. I arb sorry trial- I remain unconvinced as Iconsider it nightly undesirable when the report is discussed in Parliament,  or action based thereon istaken,   that one member of the working partyrepresenting a partial view should be able to address the House and thereby influence action in a particulardirection when others cabinet be heard.,2.. The only information before Parliament shouldbe the report.3*: If other members of the working party thinkthat one of their number may disclose their attitudeor arguments in a subsequent    parliamentary discussion,it will in my view greatly diminish the value of the confidential discussions which take place.4. It also inevitably- tends to introduce thepolitical atmosphere  into working parties which Ihave strenuously- tried to exclude.5. Though oh this occasion it would be a TradeUnionist and  the views he expressed would nodoubt be in accordance with our policy,   if the onlyparliamentary member were an   employer It might-create considerable, difficulty for us in Parliament..&apos;6. I very much hope that for these reasons youwill agree to maintain the ban on Members of Parliamentacting on working parties.T.O.O.     280750Z
