ClitCOLiiTED .. J*yw   At ..Qr..t!Zfe**.IS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (46)   193 COPY NO. 2J14th may. 1946CABINETPROPOSED INCREASE IN CHARGES OP CONTROLLEDRAILWAYS AND LONDON PASSENGERTrvANSPORT board memorandum byi the Minister of transport*       At their meeting on the 2nd May in discussion of CP. (46)174, the Cabinet agreed in principle that soxas increase in railway charges, including freight charges, should he made as soon aspossible in order to reduce the estimated deficit on railwayworking in 1946,    As requested by the Cabinet, I have considered in consultation with thu Chancellor of the Exchequer and in thelight of the discussion what should be the precise increases to bemade.2a       Objections to the proposals I put before the Cabinet were raised on the score of their effect on the Cost of Living Index,on the course of building costs and on the price margins allowedto food traders.3.       I understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer isprepared to agree that if increases in margins have to be allowedto food traders, the subsidies administered by the Ministry of food should be increased to the extent necessary to prevent a risein the Cost of Living index.    The only other point at which my proposals would directly affect the Index is the cost of domesticheating.    In the light of further consideration, I am preparedto modify my original proposals so that instead of increasing coalrates to 33^% over pre-war level (i.e. a further 162o % increase)they would be increased to only 25% over pre-war (i,e, a further8ifS increase) .    This would result in an average increase in theprice of domestic coal of -g-d   per cwt. and would add less than 0.1points to the cost of Living Index.    I understand that theChancellor is satisfied that it should be possible to accommodatethis increase in the Index without danger to the stabilisationpolicy.4.        I suggest that if coal is dealt with in this way, there can beno case for a special exemption in favour of building materials.It would be very difficult to identify building materials as suchand even the bulkier things like bricks are not carried mainly bythe railways, but are carried largely on the roads at costs whichhave increased above pre-war level considerably more than railway charges.    Further, I doubt whether, supposing we could agree tocarry a continuing loss on the ivailways and their inheritor theBritish Transport Commission, the Minister of Health would find itany easier to cooperate with the course of building costs or any criticism he may have to face on that score.    The exemption ofbuilding materials, would certainly be noticed and more harm than good would very likely be done.

5*        I realise that some of my colleagues view withreluctance the proposals wLiich I have been bound to make.The operation of my proposals will only meet in part the .estimated deficit on railway working.in the financial year192+6/7.    The trend of traffic receipts is less unfavourablethan was forecast some weeks ago and, on the assumption thatthis tendency v/ill continue and that the level of expenditurein the next twelve months will nut exceed that of 1945, itis calculated that,  if the proposed increases are broughtintr effect on. the 1st July, the increased revenue accruing to the Exchequer will be about 22 million pounds during thecurrent financial year, and that a Supplementary Estimatewill be required on the Ministry of Transport Vote for about20  million pounds/   If we are to pay any serious attention tothe importance of avoiding a&apos; drastic increase in charges justwhen the British Transport Commission takes over, and on theother hand, of avoiding starting the Commission on a subsidy,it is clear that increases of the order I have suggested willhave to be made at once.6.        I hope, therefore, that the Cabinet will now authoriseme to announce that, with effect from 1st July, .192+6 railway charges and the charges at railway docks and certain otherancillary businesses v/ill be increased as indicatedo    Ishould propose at theisame time to say that I am asking an advisory Committee to investigate fully and report on the adjustments of charges necessary to bring them into consonancewith the post-war level of costs.7.       There remains the question of the increase to beapplied to the road and rail fares of the L.P.T.B.    It has proved, impossible to find a simple method of making animmediate adjustment.    I propose, therefore, to leave thesefares for the present, subject to minor adjustments, and toask the Advisory Committee to deal with them first.A.B.Ministry of Transport.12+TH MAY,  192+6
