CABINETPALESTINEReport cf Commit tec-1&quot; of officials the Prime Minister invited us to examine,in association with the Chiefs of Staff,  the k&apos;c&apos;cto&apos;ie&apos;rid&apos;a&apos;tions made by the Anglo-American Committee:f Enquiry on Palestine,  to focus the issues and touboit recommendations for consideration by thelab met.Part I of this report contains our general:jnc 1 conclusions and reccrone ndations.Fart II sets out our detailed comments onthe particular recommendations made by the Anglc-aerican Committee.The views of the Chiefs of Staff are setat in the Annex te this report.I&quot;-rebable Reactions to the report.       A preliminary appreciation of the  probablefactions te the report, as assessed by the&apos;joint intelligence Staff,  is given in  the Appendix to the:;ncxed report by the Chiefs of Staff.2.       The reactions of the Palestinian Arabs will undoubtedly be grave.      The recommendations made in&amp;o Committee&apos;s report deny to them finally the mainEjects for which they have been contending sinceoccupation, and deprive them of the only gainAich they have actually achieved.      It is doubtfulAether the Committee are right in predicting that&amp; present-hostility of the Arab to the Jew will bedlayed by the proposed declaration that there shallWho circumstances be a Jewish State in Palestine.* Comprising representatives of the Colonial Office,Foreign Office, India Office and Treasury.
The disturbances of tin: past,  including the rebellionif 1936, were not the result of fenr of :i JcwiohState, which had not then bv.cn oi.riously mooted.Their re.nl cause was thr: dc sire of the Arabs for national indcp-cndt-iicc:    hatred and fear of the JewishNational Home was a secondary but connected cause,since the growth of the Home alone stood in the &quot;ayof the concession   &apos;f independence.      With the rise of Arab nati .nalium, the first cause not onlyremains but is even stronger than it was in 1936;the second cause,  the hatred of the National Home,has become deeper with the passage of years and willlie greatly intensified by the measures no&apos;// proposed for its development.3. The first reactions of the Arabs in Palestinewill probably take  the form of demonstrations andstrikes, leading possibly to riots .anu attacks onisolated Jewish colonies.      They are unlikely to resort to guerilla warfare or to an open armed risinguntil the possibilities of negotiation,  citherthrough the Arab League or through the United Nati -nshave been exhausted.      If, however,  it v/ere decidedto implement the report and an announcement to that effect we re made, a general Arab rising in Palestine.would probably follow.h&apos; both the immediate and. the long-term reactions. of the Arab/ States would be extremely unfavourabIo*The effect of the report, if accepted, would be to undermine belief in &quot;the  good-faith of Great Britainand in the benefits which may follow from friendshipv/ith that country -and thus to make Arab populationsmore easily accessible to Russian propaganda and influence.  &apos;   Two of His Majesty&apos;s representatives in the Middle East describe the report as a disabled^tv.rfor our interests and prestige.      There arc likelyto be hostile demonstrations in moot of the arab countries and, if there were an Arab rising inPalestine, these c untrieo would probably conniveat the smuggling &apos;1&quot; avi-vs.across the frontier and thepassage of organised bands of volunteers in support,of the insurgents.      Implementation of tho report would spoil the beginning of a long pi period of unrestin the whole Arab w rid.   . The anti-gritish feelingwhich would be stimulated would make much moredifficult the satisfactory negotiation of revisedtreaties with Egypt and Iraq.5. There ir; no doubt that all the Arab StVtcri wilregard the. policy embodied in the report as abetrayal, not only on the part of His goj\sty1sGovernment, but also on the part of tho UnitedStates, having regard to the assurances given by president Roosevelt and President Truman to thevarious Arab Rulers that they would take no actionwhich might prove hostile to the Arab people.It oh iila be noted in this connection that,  as recently as October,  19.&apos;.i.a, tor.

States Government n t 13 roach final conclusionswithout full consultation with Jewish and Arableaders.   .  It can hardly be contended that thecvmpletc reversal of p.policy proposed by the Committeeis not a change in the basic situation.6. The Moslems in India will undoubtedly sympathise with the Arabs;    their attitude on Pakistan willharden and negotiations thus be made more difficult.Shiuld the Moslems decide to resist any proposedconstitutional scheme, their resentment about palestine would add fuel to the fire.7. Turning now to the Jev/s, the immediate reactionis likely to be a fresh cuthrcalc of violence on thepart of the extremists.      They will not be satisfied by a report which denies t- them a Jewish State,which exposes their para-military organisations andthreatens their dishanctacnt, and recommends a muchgreater measure of control by Government over theJewish Agency.      There will be an outcry against thereport by the Agency, which will be echoed by thewhole Jewish press.      Probably the grant of 100,000immigration certificates and the repeal of the LandTransfers Regulations would be accepted hy the Jewishleaders as a reason to desist, for the present,  fromintensive military acti&quot;n by the Hagana, in the h&quot;pcthat by intensive propaganda in-America, they wouldbe able to obtain the remainder of their demands at alatc-r stage.      On the other hand,  they have impressed upon the youth of Palestine that the creation of a jewish State is essential and must if necessary befought for and this youth has bean worked up to sucha pitch of frensy that there is doubt whether theleaders would he obeyed.      Widespread action by theHagana is thus a possibility and continued outragesby the terrorist groups a certainty,8. It is difficult to assess the effect of thereport on Zionist opinion in America.      The extremeelements will protest vociferously, but the report is likely to be more favourably received by the moderate clement which is interested in Palestinemore from the humanitarian than from the political point of view.      The report may thus have the effectof creating a split in the American Zionist campand thus reducing its effect as a united pressure group.conclusions . Prom the political point of view, the adoptionof thG policy recommended by the An. :lo-AmorieanCommittee w uld havu disastrous effects  -.n ourposition in the Middle Kast and might have unfortunaterepercussions in India.      It would not silence the zionist ciamiur in the United States, where our administration   -f the policy w uld continue to liemisrepresented and to provide a weapon Cir anti-British propaganda.
10. From the military angle, the Chiefs of Staff report that the forces now available for use in Palestine should be adequate to handle the disorders likely to be provoked by the mere publication of the report. A different situation would, however, arise if His Majesty&apos;s Government endorsed the recommendations in the report and began to put them into operation. In the first place the Chiefs of Staff consider that, before any attempt was made to give effect to the policy recommended in the report, it would be essential that effective steps should be taken to dissolve the illegal Jewish organisations, collect the arms at their disposal, and put a stop to terrorism. This might perhaps be achieved by persuasion; and we ourselves consider (see paragraph 41 below) that the suppression of these illegal activities and the resumption of full co-operation by the Jewish agency should be made conditions precedent to the execution of the policy recommended in the report. If, however, these peaceful methods failed, the Chiefs of Staff think it would be necessary to arrest the Jewish leaders and to suppress their illegal organisations by force. Similar action would have to be taken simultaneously to disarm the Arabs. Pending the receipt of reports from Commanders-in-Chief it is not yet clear whether this forceful disarming of both sides could be carried out with the British troops now available for use in Palestine.

11. This process would, however, be only the beginning of our military difficulties. For the adoption of the report would provoke a general Arab rising in Palestine, which would be supported both materially and financially by the Arab States; and there might also be demonstrations and riots throughout the Arab countries of the Middle East. Palestine itself would require reinforcement and it would be impossible to reinforce it from elsewhere in the Middle East. In addition, the Indian troops and local forces in the Middle East must, at the best, be reported as not employable against Arabs and, at the worst, might themselves be in a state of mutiny. The conclusion of the Chiefs of Staff is that the military situation in Palestine could not be handled without considerable reinforcements and that there are no sources from which these could be drawn.

12. It thus appears that on military grounds the policy advocated by the Anglo-American Committee is not one which His Majesty&apos;s Government could carry out alone. This is equally true on financial grounds. The financial burden of giving effect to the Committee&apos;s recommendations would be enormous. The capital cost of housing the new immigrants and carrying out the large-scale development schemes would be of the order of £100 millions. The measures for improving the economic and educational standards of the Arabs would involve an annual deficit in the Palestine budget of somewhere between £5 millions and £10 millions. It seems intolerable that the whole of this burden should fall on the United Kingdom taxpayer.

13. Our conclusion is, therefore, that on political, military and financial grounds His Majesty&apos;s Government should decline to carry out alone the policy advocated by the Anglo-America Committee.


14. If this conclusion is accepted, two alternative courses of action are open:-

(1) To invite the United States Government to share with us the responsibility for proceeding forthwith to implement the report of the Anglo-American Committee - giving us not only political support but military and financial assistance. 

(2) To arrange for the situation created by the report the Anglo-American Committee to be discussed in the first instance by the Security Council of the United Nations, either on the initiative of His Majesty&apos;s Government or, preferably; on the joint initiative of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government.

15. The basis of the approach suggested in paragraph 14(2) would be to seek advice on the report. The approach would not be made by way of an appeal for assistance after acceptance of the report. We should not exclude the possibility of obtaining the approval of the Security Council to some other policy more satisfactory than that advocated in the report. Nor would such an approach preclude the subsequent participation of the United States Government in carrying out, jointly with us, any policy which might be approved by the Security Council.

16. If this second alternative were adopted, the matter could be brought before the Security Council under Article 35 of the Charter as a "situation which might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute". The Security Council is empowered by Article 36 to "recommend appropriate procedures or methods of adjustement". If the threat to international peace is not thereby removed, the Security Council may at a later stage, under Article 39, make recommendations or decide what measures shall be taken to maintain or restore international peace and security.

If the matter were so referred to the Security Council by His Majesty&apos;s Government, a public announcement could be made on the following lines:-

"His Majesty&apos;s Government have considered the report of the Anglo-American Committee of Enquiry. While they are grateful to the Committee for their valuable study of this difficult problem, they are in doubt whether it will be possible to give effect to the Committee&apos;s recommendations without thereby creating a situation which might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute, the continuance of which might be likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security.


His Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore decided that, before any action is taken on the report of the Committee, they will bring the situation to the attention of the Security Council under Article 35 of the Charter of the United Nations and ask the Council under Article 36 to recommend appropriate procedures or methods of adjustment".

If the United States Government agreed to join in bringing the matter before the Security Council, a joint announcement could be made on these lines.

17. In favour of the first alternative (paragraph 14(1)) the main arguments are:-

(a) This is the course which the Chiefs of Staff prefer on military grounds. If successful, it would be the most effective means of securing the immediate military assistance which we should require. And there are substantial military and political advantages to us in securing active United States interest in the Middle East.

(b) It would avoid directly inviting the Soviet Government to interest themselves in Palestine.

The main arguments against this course are:-

(i) It would involve an early declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government that they accepted the recommendations of the Anglo-American Committee. This declaration would precipitate disorder in Palestine and the Middle East.

(ii) It would do serious harm to our reputation in the Middle East, where it would be interpreted as showing our readiness to buy American support by sacrificing Arab interests.

(iii) In the United States it would be interpreted as revealing the deep designs which we are already suspected of having had in view when we proposed the appointment of the Anglo-American Committee.

(iv) It seems unlikely that the United States Government would accept a responsibility which would involve them during an election year, in measures for coercing the Jews in Palestine as well as the Arabs.

18. In favour of the second alternative (paragraph 14(2)) the main arguments are:-

(a) His Majesty&apos;s Government have already undertaken to bring before the United Nations a solution of the Palestine problem. It will probably


be impracticable to do this through the Trusteeship council since it is necessary, before a trusteeship agreement can be presented, that "the States directly concerned", should concur in its terms. The precise meaning of this phrase is still to be determined but in the case of Palestine it would be difficult to deny the direct concern of the five Arab members of the United Nations and probably also of the Soviet Union. There would be no prospect of obtaining the concurrence of these States in a trusteeship agreement based on the recommendations of the Anglo-American Committee.

Eventually, therefore, the problem must come before the United Nations. But before that stage is reached, an attempt to put into effect the policy recommended in the report would probably produce a situation in Palestine which would be referred to the Security Council by one or other of the Arab States, or possibly by Russia.

In these circumstances there are strong arguments for bringing the matter before the Security Council on our own initiative (or, preferably, the initiative of ourselves and the United States Government) and to do so before we have committed ourselves to adopting the recommendations of the report.

(b) Reference to the Security Council would avoid the need for any early declaration endorsing the recommendations of the report. It would thus avoid alienating the Arab States and precipitating disorders in Palestine.

(c) It would also provide time and opportunity to seek an alternative solution likely to command more support - preferably one in which the active participation of the United States Government could be secured.

(d) Discussion in the Security Council may afford an opportunity for ventilating the suggestion that the finance required for implementing this, or any other policy for Palestine might be provided through the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations and through the International Bank.

The main arguments against this alternative are:-

(i) It brings the Soviet Government into discussions on Palestine at an earlier stage than would otherwise be the case. Once the Soviet Government are so brought in, there is (as the Chiefs of Staff point out in their report: paragraph 9 of Annex) a serious risk of Soviet participation in the administration of Palestine, which would give the Soviet Government an opportunity of extending their influence throughout the Middle

(if the evacuation -.-f Egypt is forced upon us) will be   iur only remainingfooth :ld iit the Middlo East with access to the sea.      The Chiefs of Staff havestated that, from the military angle,Trans-Jordan would n:t be a satisfactory alternative.(ii-) Altheu-h it w .uld postpone difficulties with the Arabs, it mi^ht precipitatetrouble with the Jews.      Thoughimmigration continued at the existingrate   :f I,500 a month, it would involvepostponing the immigration of the100,000 Jews into Palestine, and tDthat extent would tend to stimulateillegal immigration.(iii) It is doubtful whether the United StatesGovernment would be willing to join with us in referring the matter to theSecurity Council.      They might regard this as an indication of unwillingnessto implement the report;    and it w ?uldcertainly be so regarded by many sectionsof the American Press.      It would also becondemned by firo-jionist American opinion as a manoeuvre to delay thetransfer to Palestine of the 100,000Jews from Bur ;pe.     As against this,  &apos;the United States Government could be reminded of the comment of the Anglo-American Committee that their recommendations &quot;willrrean a very heavy burden for any single Governmentto undertake, a burden which would belightened if the difficulties woreappreciated and the trustee had thesupport &quot;f other me fibers of theUnited Nations.&quot;
jIS&apos;. We offer the following comments on the particularrecommendations of-the report.The Jews in Europe    (Recommendation l)20.       The Anglo-American Committee were asked toestimate the number of Jews &quot;who vish or will beimpelled by their conditions&quot;  to leave Europe.      they found that there were 98,000 Jews from other countriesnow living in Germany, Austria and Italy;    they do not give a figure for the total number of displaced persons,Jewish and non-Jewish, hut they were told the Jewsformed about 10 per cent, of the whole.      It is primarily for these 98,000 displaced Jews that the issueof 100,000 certificates for immigration into palestine is recommended.      But the Committee also estimate that,over a longer period, &quot;as many ps 500,000 may vish orbe impelled to immigrate from Europe&quot;.      This figureapparently includes the 98,000 already mentioned.21.       The Committee were asked in the fourth of their terms of Reference, to make- recommendations for dealingwith the Jewish problem in Europe &quot;by remedial actionin the European countries in question or by theprovision of facilities for imminration to and settlement in countries outside Europe&quot;.      So far a3 concernsremedial measures in Europe,  the Committee&apos;s onlyrecommendation consists in effect of an approvingquotation of the United Hations Charter.      Promcountries outside Europe, other than Palestine, they state that they received no information which offeredany hope of substantial assistance.      They recommendthat their two Governments, &quot;together and in association with other countries&quot; should endeavour to find newhomes for displaced persons generally.22.        It cannot be said that discussion of these aspects of the problem has been advanced by theCommittees recommendation:-,.      His Majosty&apos;s Government -are already pressing for implementation of theprovisions of the Unitud Nations Charter concerninghuman rights.     His Majesty&apos;s Government and theGovernment of the United States have carried the whole iburden of maintaining refugees for the last 2-V years,   &apos;as well as contributing to the relief of displaced persons through their contributions to. U.M.K. R.A.A Committee of the Economic and Social Council of theUnited Nations, now sitting in Church House, is trying to devise appropriate machinery for the discharge ofthese responsibilities by the United Nation:;.Y/o recommend that his Majesty&apos;s Government shouldcontinue to*proso for effective relief of refugees anddisplaced persons through the machinery of the united nations.
13Gimmigration into palestine    (kocommondations 2 and 6)23.       the committee have recommended that 100,000immigration certificates he authorised immediately forthe admission into palestine of jewish victims of i-lazi&apos;- persecution, that these certificates he awarded as far -. ar, possible in 1&apos;Jnb, and that actual immigration bu1 pushed forward as ra-idly a:; conditions permit.this largo immigration is far in excess of anywhich has been permitted or contemplated in the past.it is true that a now situation has been.created ineurope as a result of the war, but this fact is unlikely to reconcile arab opinion to a figure more than 50 percent, /greater than the maximum number ever admitted ina single year (6/4.,lit/ in 1935)? :&apos;oi&quot;j;ht times the number which the royal commissioners.-.:ion proposed as the maximum annuallimit politically justifiable, and 33 per cent, greaterthan the number which v/as to bo admitted in five years under the policy of 1935-      it is the highest number which oven the most extreme joss have claimed.      thecommittee do not suggest, that the figure is justified on grounds of absorptive capacity, either economic or political;    it appears to be related not so much to circumstances in palestine as  to the number of displacedjews living in assembly centres in europe.      ko other country will take them;    therefore they should go to palestine.this figure repeats the demand made by president, truman last september, which was then refusedby the prime minister as impracticable.      the fact thatthe exact figure then urged has been, repeated will certainly he interpreted in the kiddle east as a surrender to . merican pressure.- -2U.       moreover, this large immigration is not to be final;    it is proposed in recommendation 6 thatimmigration shall continue thereafter and that arabacquiescence in it.shall not be required.      it is truethat the committee have stated that palestine alonecannot meet the emigration need;.: of the whole of .le-wryunil have recommended  thai: tin   volume of future immigrnlionshall be determined by the (ioverimie-nt of palestine,but the proposal for conl.iimia.nce must be road inconjunction with the concluding paragraphs of chapter ii of the report, where the gorimittuo estimate that thereare as many as 500,000 .&apos;ewe. in europe who may wish or beimpelled to emigrate.      Vliey add that their recommendations regarding&apos; the authorisation of certificates for palestine and the relaxation of immigration laws generally will11 in great measure relievo the feelings of urgency withwhich the jews look beyond europe.      they will boencouraged either to resettle themselves in europe&apos;, if that is possible, or wait patiently in their respectivecountrii o until their time lias come to leave&quot;.      in thelight of these remark:; and of the committe-e&apos;s failure to specify countrii     of refuge otheir than palestine,the arabs will certainly regard  the issue of 100,000certificates as merely the first instalment of half amillion.
2f).       There arc large financial implications in theproposal, for the transport, housing and maintenanceof the immigrants.      The Jewish Agency havo hithertomet the cost of transport and maintenance.      In the .;)rosunt emergency, the United States Government may hejjiTr eared to organise transport and even to contribute to its cost.      But provision of the cost of housing willbe the responsibility of the Palestine Government, or,to the extent to .\;hich they cannot find the money, ofHis i&quot;ajesty&apos;s Government.      Owin;.: to the severejvstrictions on building in Palestine since the- outbreakof war, there is already a serious shortage of accommodation, and new houses for the immigrants will thus bo essential.      No firm estimate can be made ofthe cost of providing -accommodation for an additional100,000 persons, but it will obviously run into a verylarge sum.&apos;&quot;e recommend that the United States Governmentshould be asked, if immigration is to be permitted tothe extent suggested, to make a substantial contributionto the accommodation problem both in money and materials.?-6.       The Committee &quot;have suggested that, in the award of the -100,000 certificates, priority should be givento those in the centres and, in particular, to the agedand infirm, to the very young and to skilled workmen.At present individual certificates arc allotted by theJewish Agency and to a large extent this system willhave to continue in futuvo, as this is the onlyorganisation which posse-&apos;&apos;::.:-.-:! the requisite knowledge.-But in respect of the initial 100,000 immigrants, if theynre to bo admitted, we recommend that the militaryauthorities in charge of the ceatrcs should have alarge voice in the selection of individuals, working,of course, in co-operation with the Agency.27.        It has b-_.cn suggested that a Board of Control,representing the British, Americans, Arabs and Jews,oho\ild be constituted to conti-ol immigration into palestine.     \Yo presume that such a Board would notdeal with the selection of individuals and that its main function would be the determination of futurequotas.      Wo fool that it would be preferable: to postponeconsideration of this proposal until it is known whatpart, if any,  the United State:; are to play in the future administration of Palestine.Land   (Recommendation 7)28.       None of the recommendations will cause moreindignation among the- Arabs  tlion that for the repeal of the Land Transfers Regulations.      Those Regulationswore never intended to be a political moasi-ro;    theywore enacted to secure that; Arab cultivators in certain areas could maintain their existing standard of life andto prevent the creation of a large landless arab population.      It will bo difficult to ac.li.ieve these endsby other means.      The Committee themselves recognisethat alternative legislation v/ill be required for the
Protection of tenants and cultivators, but give no indication of the form which such legislation should take.

We recommend that the Land Transfers Regulations be retained until a full inquiry has been made into the implications of their repeal and the possibility of satisfactory alternative legislation has been investigated.

Form of Government (Recommendations 3 and 4)

29. The Committee reject the claims for the constitution of either a Jewish or an Arab State in Palestine. They explicitly rule out Partition. Palestine must, in their view, be "established as a country in which the legitimate national aspirations of both Jews and Arabs can be reconciled without either side fearing the ascendancy of the other". But the Committee put forward few practical suggestions for establishing in Palestine conditions under which the two races can together enjoy the advantages of self-government. The only specific suggestions which they make are that an Arab communal organisation might be formed on the lines of the Jewish organisation administered by the Vaad Leumi, and that Arab-Jewish co-operation at the local level might be encouraged by the formation of administrative areas with a mixed population. Meanwhile, the "Government of Palestine is to be continued as at present under mandate pending the execution of a trusteeship agreement under the United Nations". Independence is not envisaged at any foreseeable date, and the present autocratic form of Government is to be continued until the hostility between Jew and Arab disappears.

30. It is open to serious doubt whether the conditions thus envisaged by the Committee are consistent with Article 76 of the Charter of the United Nations Organisation, in which the basic objectives of the trusteeship system are stated in the following terms:-

"To promote the political, economic, social and educational advancement of the inhabitants of the trust territories, and their progressive development towards self-government or independence as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned, and as may be provided by the terms of each trusteeship agreement".

There can be no doubt that "the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned" in Palestine are for early independence, the Arabs desiring it at once and the Jews as soon as they have obtained a majority by immigration directed to that end.

31. We do not think it necessary in this report to enter into discussion of the complicated issues which will arise in applying the trusteeship system in Palestine. Some of these have been touched on in paragraph 18 above. We should, however, draw attention at this point to the fact that the eventual form of trusteeship envisaged for Palestine by the Committee is trusteeship by the United Kingdom alone.


Social and Economic Development (Recommendations 5, 8 and 9)

32. The Committee have made the following recommendations under this head:-

(a) that measures should be prepared designed to raise the Arab standard of living to that of the Jews, especially in respect of social services, including hospitals;

(b) that the educational system of both Jews and Arabs be reformed, including the introduction of compulsory education within a reasonable time;

(c) that certain large-scale development plans presented to the Committee be examined, discussed and executed in consultation and co-operation, not only with the Jewish Agency, but also with the Governments of the neighbouring Arab States directly affected; and

(d) that these plans should be conceived as public projects and undertaken by Government and not by any private organisation.

33. We are of course, in principle, in favour of the implementation of these recommendations, which would certainly have been adopted in the past but for their financial implications. The Government is at present spending about £500,000 a year on health services for the country as a whole; in addition to their share of this amount the Jews spend an additional £2,000,000 on medical services for their own third of the population. To provide similar services for the Arabs would thus involve a sum of the order of £4,000,000 a year, together with the large capital cost of the necessary hospitals and clinics. Other social services show the same disparity between Government and Jewish expenditure. In the field of education, whereas 97 per cent. of the Jewish school-age population attend school, only 33 per cent. of the Arab school-age population attend; and to introduce compulsory education for the Arabs would entail the provision of schools, teachers and equipment for an additional 200,000 children. The Committee also recommend the provision of adequate facilities for Arab Secondary and University education. To give effect to these educational proposals would involve a very large capital sum and a recurring expenditure which might well be of the order of 4 or 5 million pounds a year.

34. No indication is given by the Committee of the source whence these funds will be provided but Palestine will certainly be unable to bear more than a small fraction of the expense. Full acceptance of the Committee&apos;s recommendations (a) and (b) would involve an annual grant-in-aid which might possibly be of the order of £10 million pounds and a further and probably much larger initial grant for capital expenditure. This outlay would presumably have to be met by His Majesty&apos;s Government.


35. As regards development projects, that in which public attention has been primarily focused and to which the Committee specifically refer is the Jordan Valley Scheme. This scheme, which, if it is found practicable, the Committee recommend should be undertaken by Government, is estimated to cost £76,000,000; but the brief scrutiny so far possible indicates that the expenditure is probably under-estimated and the anticipated revenue considerably over-estimated. Financial responsibility would rest on the Palestine Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government, even if some part of the money might be borrowed either from international Jewry or from the Bretton Woods Bank.

36. To accept the recommendations regarding immigration and land sales without simultaneously accepting those relating to Arab betterment would be to throw the whole picture out of balance. But even if His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to accept the financial liability involved in the latter, there is little reason to believe that such acceptance will have the effect which the Committee expect. The Palestine Arabs are not interested at the moment in moral or material development; they are interested only in retaining Palestine as an Arab country, and no bribe in the form of material advantages is likely to weaken their antagonism to the main features of the report.

37. We recommend that the scheme for a Jordan Valley Authority should be fully examined in the near future by prominent Consulting Engineers and a full report obtained.

Security (Recommendation 10)

38. The Committee have recommended that, if their report is adopted, it should be made clear to Jews and Arabs alike that any attempt to prevent its execution by violence will be resolutely suppressed. They further express the view that the Jewish agency "should at once resume active co-operation with the Mandatory in the suppression of terrorism and illegal immigration". Chapter IX of the report contains an account of illegal Jewish organisations and activities.

39. The Committee do not suggest that the suppression of these activities, and the resumption of co-operation by the Jewish agency, should be made conditions of the execution of the Report, which concedes so much to Zionist demands; and there is little in the Report to encourage the hope expressed by the Committee that large reductions in the present abnormally high expenditure on police and other security services will be possible in the forseeable future. Nevertheless their tenth recommendation is an invitation to the Mandatory to take more rigorous action against terrorism.

annex report by the Chiefs of Staff.far as it has &quot;been possible in the short time, we have examined the Report&quot;hof the Anglo-Committee of Enquiry into Palestine and thei of Jews in Europe, We have called for! of Commanders-in-Chief on the steps which: to &quot;be taken if it is decided to endorse thisid carry its recommendations into effect.?iceipt of their Report, our views &quot;below shouldled as provisional.Ithe Appendix is attached a short preliminaryy the Joint Intelligence Staff of the probableJewish reactions tc the Report when published,se we arc- in general agreement.&amp;e military implications of the recomraendstionsvport can best be considered in two phases:-a) On the publication of the Report.s) On the endorsement and implementation of the Report.IjJION OP THE REPORT.&quot;S consider that although considerable damage,ii and inter-racial clashes will result, thein Palestine or available for use in the should be adequate to prevent a serious;-tion in the internal situation.

We.that this period may be protracted.%ENT AND -IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REPORT.5&apos;ding the development of Arab opposition on a:;-ie we consider that the forces at presentior Palestine would be adequate.      At a later&apos;^ver,  there is a probability of a general&quot;^S in Palestine supported both materially and*   D.0.(1+6) 61
financially by the Arab states. Furthermore, there may be, as shown in the Appendix, demonstrations and riots throughout the other Moslem countries of the Middle East. We shall therefore be faced with a situation in that not only will Palestine itself require reinforcement, but it will be impossible to move troops to Palestine from elsewhere in the Middle East. In ? Indian troops and local forces in the Middle East must, at the best, be regarded as not ? against Arab forces and at the worst may ? be in a state of mutiny.

It follows that reinforcement of Palestine and the Middle East from outside will be necessary. We are unable without reference to the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, to estimate the scale of reinforcement required but we are of the opinion that it is likely to be considerable.

British Military Reinforcement.

The only reinforcement available in the Mediterranean area is one Armoured Division in Italy, already earmarked as the reinforcement in the event of ? in Venezia Giuilia.

Looking elsewhere there appears to be no possibility of providing British reinforcements since international and other inescapable commitments are already straining our resources to the limit.

There is a further serious aspect to the question, in that these commitments are likely to continue for a protracted period. This will prevent the run-down required to meet the Government man-power policy.

Alternative courses of action open to us.

In face of the situation in which we cannot find necessary British reinforcements, there appear to be the following alternative courses of action - 

(a) to seek American military aid;

(b) to appeal to U.N.O.

American Participation.

Since the increased military commitment will result from the recommendation of an Anglo-American Committee we consider that we should be justified in requesting military assistance from the U.S.A.

American participation would have the advantage of ensuring their active support in solving the problem of Palestine and easing our burden. Furthermore, American interest in the Middle East would be to our long-term strategic advantage.

We are confident that, if political difficulties can be overcome, from the purely military point of view joint forces could be made to operate smoothly.


Appeal to U.N.0.9. An appeal to U.N.O. would &quot;bo unlikely to result in the provision of any immediate military assistance, and would moreover be fraught with gravomilitary consequences;-(a) We should risk losing what, if theevacuation of Egypt is forced upon us, will be our only remaining footholdin the Middle east with access to thesea.      Trans-Jordan would not provide an alternative.(b) V/e should risk Russian participation,and afford Russia  the opportunity of extending her influence throughout theMiddle East and into the Mediterranean.The necessity for dissolving illegal JewishOrganisations.10.    As the Gorniidttoe of Enquiry so clearly point out,&quot;Palestine iu an armed camp&quot; in which have developed largoillegal Je-.7ish armed forces.    &quot;Private armies ought not to exist;    they constitute a danger to the peace of the world.11*       Wo cannot over-ompe osjj-j the necessity ofdissolving these illegal organisations, collectingthe arms at their disposal, and putting a stop toterrorism., eefc-e attempting to carry into effect theCommittee of Enquiry1s recommendation.      It may bepossible to achieve this by persuasion, by dint of anglo-American pressure on the Jewish agency, andin this case it may not be necessary to arrest theJewish leaders.      But if persuasion fails, it will benecessary to arrest the loaders and suppress the illegal Organisations uj fuioo.&apos;    V/e have asked the commanders-in-Chiof to say how long they think this latter operation would toko.CONCLUSIONS. \12.       We conclude that:-(a) The publication of the Report will not of itself produce disorders in Palestinebeyond the capabilities cf the forcesat present available.      But endoroementof the Report, and a decision to carry.   &apos; . its recommendations into full effect wouldresult In n situation which would demandreinforcements beyond our capacity toprovide.(b) The provision of forces by the United states would,  if politically practicable, have great military advantages..
(c) iln appeal to U.N.O. is unlikely to result in the provision of any immediate assistance, and would be-fraught with grave militaryconsequences. (See para.  9 above)l[d) Before proceeding to put into effect the recommendations in the Committee&apos;sReport,  it will be essential todisarm and dissolve the illegalJewish organisations.

JT.7ISH AND ARAB REACTIONS4.       In this part of the report we endeavour to forecast there actions to the publication of the findings of tho Anglo-American Committee on Palestine.     *Ve distinguish throughoutbetween the reactions which -re likely immediately to followpublication of the report and those which are likely to ariselater, particularly if the findings are endorsed by HisHajesty&apos;3 Government and if it becomes clear that they willbe carried into execution.The Jews5.       The immediate reaction is likely to be a fresh outbreakof violence on the part of some Jewish extremists.      It islikely that the Jewish Agency will hesitate for some time,and will be considerably embarrassed by this renewal of violence.        The Jewish leaders would appreciate that onthe one hand the report goes some way to meet their requirements,especially as regards immediate immigration, and they wouldbe anxious to avoid the loss of those &quot;benefits by anyprecipitate action.      On the; other hand they will fear thatthe strictures passed on their leadership in Chapter IX ofthe report may bo a prelude to repressive action by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.      Tho Jewish Agonoy arc therefore likelyto await events and thoy will be followed in their attitude bythe bulk of the Jewish population.      The Jewish press andillegal wireless would immediately voice dissatisfaction.6.       At a later stage, when implementation is expected, theJewish leaders, followed by the bulk of the Jewish population,will&apos; probably decide to accept the additional 100,000 immigrantsas a s&apos;tepping-stone to the achievement of their ultimateambitions.      Meanwhile they will continue,  in their publicdeclarations and press,  to reserve their attitude on the main principles and to express their dissatisfaction with theCommittee&apos;s report,7.       It is expected that tho Jeotsh Agency will co-operate inthe suppression&apos;of Arab attneke on personnel and property Ifany brook out.
-    WJArabs In F-lostincP.       Though it is probable that the Fades tine. Arabs will immediately declare strikes and carry out demonstrationsexpecially at Jaffa as soon   s the report is published, it isto be expected that they will&apos;avoid any immediate outbreak ofguerrilla warfare or any open p,rmed rising until they feelthey have exhausted the possibilities of negotiations, boththrough the Arab League and by representations on their behalfand appeals to UNO by the Arab States.      It is possible tiv-tisolated attacks may take place on Jewish colonies, and thatsnail groups of Arabs will bo stimulated to direct action byJewish excesses.     More of the civil Arab population are armed. than was the case in 1936 and. ma/iy Arabs have received militarytraining.9.       At a later stage, and especially if they feel they are-faced with a fait accompli by the implementation of theCommittee&apos;s recommendations without, consultation with theArabs, a general Arab rising in Palestine is probable.      this might take place earlier if the economic situation in Fnlestincwere to deteriorate meanvhilo as the result of strikes andboycotts or for other reasons.      There will probably also bedesertion by Arabs serving in K.M. Forces.A&quot;Ai&quot;i STATES - IOeneral10.      Both the immediate and the long-term reaction of theArab States to the Committee&apos;s report is-likely to bo extremelyunfavourable.      The effect, on the Arab world generally willbe to undermine belief in our o--m good faith or in the benefits which may follow from friendship &quot;.&apos;ith Great Britain and Americaand thus to make Arab -populations more easily accessible to russian propaganda and influence.11.      It is probable that the Arab League will call anImmediate sons Ion and nail for action to bo taken by the
(itffer&apos;ent Arab States in the event of the implementation ofthe Committee&apos;s proposals.      Implementation will he followedby a Ion,&quot; period of unrest in the whole Arab world.Iran.lit.     The immediate reaction is likely to be sharpest inIraq.     H.M. Ambassador Bagdad reports that the recommendations will be unfavourably received in all quarters from the Regentdownwards,  that there will be an outcry in the Fress and inParliament and demonstrations in towns, perhaps lending toviolence.      He adds that open hostility is likely to continue for an indefinite period.13.     At a later stsPe, if an ^rab rising occurs in Palestine,the Iraqi Government is likely to smuggle considerable quantities of arms across the frontier and connive at thepassage of organised bands of volunteers in support of the insurgents.      In addition there may be serious riots involvingattacks on British residents and perhaps a pogrom in Bagdad.There may also be tribal unre3t threatening our communications and oil pipeline.Levant States14.     II. M.  Minister Beirut states that  the report v/ill arouseintense and uncompromising opposition in Syria and the lebanon, and that acceptance of the report by ills Majesty&apos;aGovernment will bo regarded as a. breach of faith sufficientto destroy Arab confidence for the future.      Immediatereactions to publication will probably be student demonotrations,fiery articles in the Press and possibly attacks on Jews and jewish property. .   There may also be a few isolated attacks on official communications in Syria.      At a latur stage ifdisorders break out in Palestine full support, is likely to begiven from Syria to the ,\arabs of Palestine.
-    15i15.      Ibn Saud is likely to regard the report as a breach of faith,  in. view of the promises made by President roosevelt to which he recently drew attention.      His resentment,  shouldthe report be finally adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government islikely to be such that though he would not take the leadagainst us, he would associate himself with the generalreactions of the Arab League.      H.H. Minister Jedda reportsthat he and other Arab leaders will consider this asperpetuation of an injustice which they deem intolerable.&quot;.s is likely to turn sour as regards economic co-operationwith the Americans pnd ourselves, and as regards air facilitiProas Jordan .16.      In Trans Jordan there are likely to be demonstrations inthe capital and persistent attempts to smuggle -arms andammunition into Palestine in the event of. an Arab rising.At a later stage there may bo disaffection in the ArabLegion-and the Transjordan Frontier J?&apos;orce.IV.      Publication of the report is likely to lead to animmediate outbreak of strikes,  demonstrations and acts ofhooliganism aimed at Jewish property in the main towns.The anti-British feeling which will be stimulated by thoreport may be expected to render the work of the negotiatorsfor treaty revision very much more difficult,  if not impossible.India18.      Publication of/the report may not have any immediate effect on tho Moslem population of India, who are alreadyconcentrating on tho future settlement of their own problems.It would, however, convince them that Ills Majesty&apos; aGovernment ore lacking In yympothy for Kr. loin populations
