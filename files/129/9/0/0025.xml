PREFACE ^ ^We were appointed by the Government of the United States and ofthe United Kingdom,  as a joint body of American and British member -ship, with the following Terms of Reference:-1,    To examine political,  economic and social conditions inPalestine as they bear upon the problem of Jewish immigration and settlement therein and the well-being of the peoples-now livingtherein,2*   To examine the position of the Jews in those countries, inEurope where they have been the victims of Nazi and Fascistpersecution, and the practical measures taken or contemplated to, be taken in those countries to enable them to live free fromdiscrimination and oppression and to make estimates of those who wish or will be impelled by their conditions to migrate to palestine or other countries outside Europe.3,    To hear the views of competent witnesses and to consultrepresentative Arabs and Jews on the problems of Palestine assuch problems . are affected by conditions subject to examinationunder paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 above and by other relevant facts and circumstances,  and to make roconrnendations to His-Majesty1 s Government and the Government of the United States forad interim handling of these problems as well as for their permanent solution.4.    To make such other recommendations to His Majcsty&apos;sGovernment and the Government of the United States as may benecessary to meet the uanediate needs prising from conditionssubject to examination under paragraph 2 above, by remedial action in the European countries in question or by the provisionof facilities for emigration to and settlement in countries out-side Europe.The Governments urged upon us the need for the utmost expeditionin dealing with the subjects committed to us for investigation, and requested to be furnished with our Report within one hundred and&quot;twenty days of the inception of our Inquiry.assembled in Washington on Friday, 4th January, 1946 and began/ our
-2-   (Prof nee)bur..public sessions on the following Monday.   We soiled from theUnited States on 18th January and resumed our public sessions in london on 25th January,   V/e left for Europe on 4th and 5th February, and,,working, in Sub-Committees, proceeded, to our investigations in Germany,Poland, Czecho-Slovakia, Austria,  Italy and Greece.    On 28th Februarywe flew to Cairo and,  after sessions there, reached Jerusalem on 6th March.    In Palestine our sessions, were interspersed with personalvisits to different parts of the country, during which we sought to acquaint ourselves at first hand, with its various characteristics andthe Ways of life of its inhabitants.    Sub-Conmittees visited thecapitals of Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi-Arabia and Trans-Jordan to hear the views of the Arab Governments and representatives of bodies concerned with the subjects before us.   We left Palestine on 28thMarch and have concluded our deliberations in Switzerland,       the detailed itinerary is shown in Appendix 1.We now submit the folio-fling Report.
PART 1C H A P T E R     1RECOMMENDATIONS AND COMMENTS.THE EUROPEAN       RECOMMEND ATI QST No. 1     WE   HAVE TO REPORT THAT SUCH INFORMATIONPROBLEMi AS WE RECEIVED ABOUT COUNTRIES OTHER THAN PALESTINE GAVE NOHOPE OF SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE IN FINDING HOMES FOR JEWS WISHINGOR IMPELLED TO LEAVE EUROPE.BUT PAIK5TINE .ALGNE CANNOT MEET THE EMIGRATION NEEDS OF THEJEWISH VICTIMS OF NAZI AND FASCIST PERSECUTION.    THE whole world SHARES RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM AND INDEED FOR THE R&amp;.SETTLEMENT OF ALL &quot;DISPLACED PERSONS. &quot;WE THEREFORE RECOMMEND THAT OUT GOVERNMENTS TOGETHER, ANDIN ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, SHOULD ENDEAVOUR immediately to FIND NEW HOMES FOR ALL SUCH &quot;DISPLACED PERSONS&quot;, irrespective of CREED OR NATIONALITY, WHOSE TIES WITH THEIR FORMER COMMUNI-TIES HAVE BEM IRREPARABLY BROKEN.THOUGH EMIGRATION WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF SOME victims of PERSECUTION, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY, INCLUDING A CCN-SIDERABLE NUMBER OF JEWS, WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE IN EUROPE.WE RECOMMEND THEREFORE THAT OUR GOVERNMENTS ENDEAVOUR TO SECURETHAT IMMEDIATE EFFECT IS GIVEN TO THE PROVISION OF THE united nations CHARTER CALLING FOR &quot;UNIVERSAL RESPECT FOR, AND.OBSERVANCE OF, HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS FOR ALLWITHOUT DISTINCTION AS TO RACE, SEX, LANGUAGE, OR RELIGION. &quot;&apos; COMMENT.In recommending that our Governments, in association with other countries,  should endeavour to find new homes for&quot;displaced persons,&quot; we do not suggest that any country should beasked to make a permanent change right its immigration policy.    Theconditions, which we have seen in Europe, are unprecedented,  andso unlikely to arise again that we are convinced that special provision could and should be made in existing immigration, lawsto meet this unique and peculiarly distressing situation./Fur therraore

In-our view the mass emigration of &quot;all European Jews wouldvbe-:&apos;- of serviceneither to the Jews themselves nor t5 Europe.   Every effort should be made to enable the Jews to rebuild their&quot; shattered communities, &quot;whilepermitting those Jews; who wish to&apos;! do so, to&apos;emigrate..    In order to achieve this,: restitution of Jewish la-operty should be effected as soonas possible .......Our investigations-&apos;-&quot;sh owe&apos;d us that tho Governments chieflyconccmctl had for. the most part-already passed legislation to this end.A real obstacle-,. however, to individual&apos;restitution is that tho attempt-to give effect to this legislation is frequently a cause of active anti-semitism.   T/q suggest that, for the reconstruction of tho Jewish -commuhities,, restitution of their corporate property, either jshrougti&apos;reparations payments or through other.-means-,&apos; is of the first importance.Nazi occupation has- left behind it a legacy of -anti-Semitism.&apos; this cannot be combated by legislation alone.    The only really effectiveantidotes arc the. enforcement by each Government of guaranteed civilliberties-and equal rights, a programme of education in the positive ;   -principles of democracy, &apos; tho sanction of :-a strong world public opinion -combined with.economic recovery and stability. ., &apos;-&apos;-::&apos;RECOMMENDATION^ No .1-2;-, . . we mcwmki &apos; (A) THAT 100,000 CERTIFICATES BEAUTHORISED IMMEDIATELY FOR&apos; THE ADMISSION INTO PALESTINE OF JE1-7S MO HAVEBEEN THE VICTIMS OF NAZI AND FASCIST PERSECUTION;   (B) THAT THESE CERT-TFICATES BE AWARDED AS FAR AS.

CHAPTER   I Page   5than that number in Germany; Austria and Italy alone^    Although nearly a-year, has passed since their liberation,  the majority of those inGermany and Austria are still living in assembly centres,  the so-called&quot;camps&quot;, island communities in the midst of those at &quot;whose hands theysuffered so much.In their interests and in the interests of Europe, the centresshould be closed and their camp life ended.    Most of them have cogentreasons for wishing to leave Europe.    Many are the sole survivors oftheir families and few have any ties binding tliem to the countries inwhich they used to live.-Since the end of hostilities^ little has been done to xorovide fortheir re-settlement elsewhere.    Immigration laws and restrictions bartheir entry to most countries and much time must pass before such laws and restrictions can be altered and effect given to the alterations.Some can go to countries where they have relatives;    others may secureinclusion in certain quotas.    Their number is comparatively small.We knovj of no country to which the great majority can go in theimmediate future other than Palestine,.   Fjjrthermore that, is where almost all of them Want to go.    There they are sure that they &quot;Will receive a welcome denied them elsewhere.    There they hope to enjoy peace and re-. build their lives.We believe it is essential that they should be given an opportunityto do so at the earliest possible time.    Furthermore we have the assurancof the leaders of the Jewish Agency that they will be supported and caredfor.We recommend the authorisation and issue of 100,000 certificatesfor these reasons and because we feel that their immediate issue willhave a most salutary effect upon the whole situation.In the awarding of these certificates priority should as far as .possible be given to those, in the centres,  and to those liberated inGermany and Austria who are no longer in the centres but remain in thosecountries.    We do not desire that other Jewish victims who wish or willbe impelled by their circumstances to leave the countries where they now are,  or that those who fled from persecution before the. outbreakof war,  should be excluded.We appreciate that there will be difficultyin deciding questions of priority, but none the less we urge that sofar as possible such a system should be adhered to, and that,  in apply-ing it, primary consideration should be given to the aged and infirm,/to the. .,.
CHAPTER   I Pege Lto the very young and also to skilled workmen whose services will heneeded for many months on work rendered necessary &quot;by the large influx.It should he made clear that no advantage in the obtaining of acertificate- is to be gained by migrating from one country to another,or by entering Palestine illegally.Receiving so large a number will be a heavy burden on Palestine,We feel sure that the authorities will shoulder it and that they willhave the full co-operation of the Jewish Agency.Difficult problems will confront those responsible for organisingand carrying out the movement.    The many organisations - public and private - working in Europe will certainly render all the aid they con;we mention UNRRA especially;    Co-operation by all throughout is necessary.We are sure that the Government of the United States, which hasshown such keen interest in this matter, will participate vigorouslyand generously with the Government of Great Britain in its fulfilment.There are many -ways in which help can be given,  -.Those who have opposed the admission of these unfortunate peopleinto Palestine should know that we have fully considered all that theyhave put before us.    We hope that they will look upon the. situationagain,  that they will appreciate the considerations which/ have led usto our conclusion,  and that above all, if they cannot see their wayto help, at least they 7/ill not make the position of these sufferersmore difficult.ffiMCIP.LES OP RECOMMENDATION No.  5.      IN ORDER TO DISPOSE,  once AND FOR ALL, OP THEGOVERNMENT:NO ARABT NO     EXCLUSIVE CLAIMS OF JEWS AND ARABS TO PALESTINE, WE REGARD IT ASJJLTSH STATE&apos; ESSENTIAL THAT A CLEAR STATEMENT OF THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES SHOULD BEMADE:I.    THAT JEW SHALL NOT DOMINATE ARAB AND .ARAB SHALL NOT DOMINATE JEWIN PALESTINE.    II.    THAT PALESTINE SHALL BE NEITHER A JEWISH STATE NORAN ARAB STATE.    III.    THAT THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT ULTIMATELY TO BEESTABLISHED, SHALL, UNDER INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES,. FULLY PROTECT ANDi. , PRESERVE THE INTERESTS IN THE HOLY LAND OF CHRISTENDOM AND OF THE MOSLEMAND JEWISH FAITHS.THUS. PALESTINE MUST ULTIMATELY BECOME A STATE WHICH GUARDS THERIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF MOSLEMS, JEWS AND CHRISTIANS ALIKE: AND ACCORDSTO THE INHABITANTS, AS A WHOLE, THE&apos; FULLEST MEASURE OF SELF-GOVERNMENT,CONSISTENT WITH THE THREE PARAMOUNT PRINCIPLES SET FORTH ABOVE./CQMMMT.
CHAPTER, I.    Page 5-COMMENT &apos;   &apos; .Throughout the long and bloody struggle of Jew one! Arab for dominancein Palestine, each crying fiercely:  &quot;This land&apos;, is nine&quot; - except &quot;for thebrief reference in the Report of the Royal &quot;Commission (hereinafter referredto as the Peel Report) and the little evidence, written and -oral, that we received on this point - the great interest of the Christian World InPalestine has been completely overlooked,- glossed over or brushed aside.We,  therefore, emphatically declare that Palestine is a Holy Land,sacred to Christian, to Jew and to Moslem alike; and&quot; because it is a HolyLand, Palestine is not, and can never become, a land which, any race orreligion can justly claim as its- very own.We further, in the same emphatic way,  affirm that the fact that it isthe Holy Land,  sets Palestine - completely apart from other- lands, and&apos; dedicaJit to the precepts and practices- of the Brotherhood of Man; not those ofnarr-ow nationalism,For another reason, in the light of its long history, and particularlyits history of the last thirty years, Palestine cannot be regarded as eithe:a. purely Arab &quot;or a purely Jewish land.The Jews have a historic connection with the country.    The JewishNational Home, though embodying a. minority of the population, is today a.reality established&apos; under international guarantee:.   It has- a. right tocontinued existence, protection and development.Yet Palestine is not,, and never can be, a purely Jewish land, , It liesat the crossroads of the &quot;Arab world.    Its Arab population, descended fromlong-time inhabitants of the area, rightly look upon Palestine as theirhomeland.It is therefore neither just nor practicable that Palestine should become either an Arab State, in which an Arab majority would control the  .destiny of a Jewish minority,  or a Jewish State,  in-which a Jewish majority would control that of an Arab minority.    In neither case would minorityguarantees afford adequate protection for the subordinated group.-A Palestinian put the natter- thus:  &quot;In the hearts of us Jews there hasalways been a fear that, some day this - country would bo: turned into an Arab1State and the Arabs would -rule over, us. This fear has at times reached the proportions of terror....   Now this same feeling of fear has- started up inthe hearts of Arabs .... fear-lest the jews acquire the ascendancy and ruleover them&quot;. ,^ n/Palcstxne,   ....
164CHAPTER-       Pago 6. a v-xPalestine^ then, must &quot;bo established as; a country in which the legitimate national aspirations of both Jews and Arabs can be reconciled,without either&quot;&apos; side fearing the ascendancy of the other.    In our view this &quot;cannot be done under any form of constitution; in -which a merenumerical majority is decisive,  since it is precisely the struggle fora numerical majority which bedevils Ar.ab-Jev.dsh relations.    To ensuregenuine self-government for both the Arab and the Jewish communities,this struggle must be mo.de purposeless by the constitution itself.RECOMMEND AT I ON N o. 4.    WE HAVE HEACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT THE HOSTILITY .BETWEEN JEWS AND ARABS AND,  IN PARTICULAR, THE DETERMINATION OF EACH to achieve DOMINATION, IP NECESSARY BY VIOLENCE, MAKE IT ALMOST CERTAIN THAT,NOV.r AND FOR SOME TIME TO COM3, ANY ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH EITHER AN INDE-PENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE OR INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATES WOULD RESULTIN CIVIL-STRIFE SUCH AS MIGHT THREATEN THE PEACE OF THE WORLD.    WE THERE-FORE RECOMMEND THAT,  UNTIL THIS HOSTILITY DISAPPEARS, THE GOVERNMENT OF   -PALESTINE BE CONTINUED AS AT PRESENT UNDER MANDATE PENDING THE EXECUTION -OF.A TRUSTEESHIP AGREEMENT   UNDER THE UNITED NATIONS.COMMENT.. We recognise&apos; that in view of the powerful forces both Arab and jewish,  operating from outside Palestine, the task of Groat Britain, asMandatory, has not been easy,    Tho Peel Commission declared In 1937 thatthe Mandate was unworkable, and the Permanent Mandates Commission of theLeague of Nations thereupon pointed out that it become almost unworkableonce it was publicly declared to be so by such a body.    Two years later the British Government, having come to the conclusion that the alternative of Partition proposed by the Peel Commission was also unworkable,  announced,their intention of taking steps to terminate the Mandate by the establish^ment of on independent Palestine State.    Our recommendations are based on what we believe at this stage to be as fair a measure of justice to allas we can find in view of what has gone before and of. all that has beendone.    We rccor-mise that they are not in accord with the claims of eitherX:-&apos;party, and furthermore that they involve a departure from the recent policyof the Mandatory.   We recognise that, if they are adopted,  they will involvea. long period of trusteeship, which will mean a very heavy burden for any-single Government to undertake, -a burden which would be lightened if thedifficulties were appreciated and. the Trustee had the support, of other-members of the United Nations.   . /EQUALITY

Even under conditions of war,which brought considerable financial benefits to the Arabs,  thisdisparity has not been appreciably reduced.;    Only by a deliberate andcarefully planned policy on the part of the Mandatory can the Arabstandard of living be raised to that of the Jewst-   In stressing and need for such a policy we would particularly call attention to thediscrepancies between the social services, including hospitals^available in Palestine for Jews -nd Arabs.We fully recognise that the Jewish social services are financed&apos;   . to a very great extent by the Jewish community in Palestine, with theassistance of. outside Jewish organisations;    and we would stress that nothing should be done which would bring these social services, down to-Hie. level of those provided&apos;- for the Arabs,  or halt the constant improve-ments now being made in them,We suggest that consideration&apos; be given to the advisability of encouraging the formation by the Arabs of an Arab -community on the linesof the Jewish community which now &quot;largely controls and finances Jewisheooial -services.The Arabs will have to rely,  to a far greater extent than, the Jews, on financial aid from the Governments    But the Jews ofPalestine should accept the-necessity that taxation, raised from bothJews and Arabs, will have to be rpe..vb very largely on the Arabs inorder to bridge the gap which,now existb.be two on the standard ofliving of the ttfo peoples.;, . /FUTURE...
CHAPTER_I gage   8RECOMMENDATION   Mo. 6.   WE. RECOMMEND THAT PENDING THE EARLY REEERENCETO THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE EXECUTION OF A TRUSTEESHIP AGREEMENT,.THE MANDATORY SHOULD /DMNISTER PALESTINE ACCORDING TO THE MANDATEWHICH DECLARES WITH REGARD TO . IMMIGRATE ON THAT &quot;THE ADMINISTRATE ON OFPALESTINE, WHILE ENSURING THAT THE RIGHTS AND POSITICN OF OTHER SECTIONSOF THE POPULATION ARE NOT PREJUDICED, SHALL FACILITATE JEWISH IMMEGRA-TIGN UNDER SUITABLE CONDITIONS&quot;.QOMMSNTjWe have recommended the admission of 100,000 immigrants, victims ofNazi perseiution, as soon as possible.   We now deal With the positionafter the admission of that number.    We cannot look far into the future.We cannot construct a yardstick for annual immigration.    Until a Trustee-ship Agreement is executed it is our clear opinion that Palestine shouldbe administered in accordance with the terms of the Mandate quoted above.Farther than that we cannot go in the form of a recommendation.In this disordered world speculation as to the economic position ofany country a few years ahead would be a hazardous proceeding.    It isparticularly difficult to predict what,  after a fe-fl years have passed,will be the economic and political condition of Palestine,   We hopethat the present friction and turbulence will soon die away and be re-placed by an era of ]oea*e,  absent&apos; so long from the Holy. Land;  tba t theJew and Arab will soon realise that collaboration is to their mutual advantage, but no one can say how long this will take.The possibility of the country sustaining a largely increasedpopulation at a decent standard of living depends on its economic future,which in turn depends largely on whether or not plans referred to inRecommendation No.8 can be brought to fruition.The Peel Commission stated that political as well as economic,considerations have to be taken into account in regard to iirmigration,and. recommended a &quot;politioal high level&quot; of 1 2,000 a year.   We. cannot recommend the fixing of. a minimum or of a maximum for annual immigrationin the future.    There are too many.uncertain factors./V/e desire.....
CHAPTER I.    Page 9-Vfe desire, however, t a - state certain considerations which we agreeshould ho taken- into account in dctcrxn-ining what number of immigrantsthere should be in- any;.period.    It is the right of every independentnation to determine in the interests of its people the number- of immigrants to be admitted, to its lands.    Similarly it must, we think, be concededthat it should be the right of the Government of Palestine to decide,having rcg.ard.to the well-being of all the people of Palestine, thenumber of immigrants to te admitted within any given period.In Palestine there is the Jewish National Home,  created in consequenceof the Balfour Declaration. &apos; Some may think that that Declaration was wrong and should not have been made:  some &quot;that it was a conception on a * - -grand scale&quot;and that effect can be given to one of the most daring andsignificant colonisation plans in history.   Controversy as to which view is right is fruitless.    The National Hone is there.    Its roots are deepin the soil of Palestine.    It cannot be argued out of existence: neither-can the achievements of the Jewish pioneers.The Government of Palestine, in having regard&apos; to the well-being ofall the people of Palestine cannot ignore the interests of so large a section of the population.    It cannot ignore the achievements- of the lastquartor of a century.    No-Government of Palestine doing, its duty to thepeople of that land can fail to do its best not only to maintain&apos; the &apos;National Home, but also to foster its proper development and such develop-ment must in our view involve immigration.;.The well-being of all the people of Palestine, be. they Jews, - Arabs orneither, must ^be the governing consideration.    Wo&apos; reject the view that  .there shall be no further Jewish immigration into Palestine - without Arab -acquiescence,  a view which would result in the Arab dominating the Jew. -We also reject the insistent Jewish demand that forced Jewish immigrationmust proceed apace in  order to produce as quickly as possible a Jewishmajority and a Jewish State.    The well-being of the Jews must not be subordinated to that of the Arabs: nor that of the Arabs to the Jews, Thewell-being of both, the economic situation of Palestine as a. whole, the degree of execution-of plans for further development,  all have to bocarefully considered in deciding the number- of immigrants for anyparticular period./Palestine ....
CHAPTER I. &apos; Page 10.Palestine is a land sacred&apos;to three Faiths and must not become theland of any one of them to the exclusion of the others,  and Jewishirani  ration for the development of the National Home must not. become apolicy of discriiniiiation against other iraid.gr ants-;    Any person, therefore,who&quot;desires and is qualified under applicable laws to enter Palestine mustnot be refused admission- or subjected to discrimination on the ground thathe is not a Jew.    All provisions respecting immigration must be drawn,executed and applied with that principle always firmly in mind.Further, while we recognise that any Jew who enters Palestine inaccordance with its-laws is there of right, we expressly disapprove ofthe position: taken in some Jewish quarters that Palestine has&apos; in some waybeen ceded or granted as their State to the Jews of the world, that everyJew everywhere is, merely because he is a Jew,  a. citizen of Palestine andtherefore can enter- Palestine as of &quot;right without regard to conditions imposed by the Government upon&apos; entry, and that therefore there can be noillegal immigration of Jews into Palestine.    We declare end affirm thatany immigrant Jew who enters Palestine contrary to its- laws is an illegalimmigrant.RECOMMEND ATI ON No. 7.    (A) WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LAND TRANSFERS regulations of 1940 BE RESCINDED AND REPLACED BY REGULATIONS BASED ON A POLICY of freedom IN THE SALE,  LEASE OR USE OF LAND, IRRESPECTIVE OF RACE,  community or CREED; AND PROVIDING ADEQUATE PROTECTION FOR THE. INTERESTS OF SMALLOWNERS AND TENANT CULTIVATORS.&apos;    (b) WE FURTHER RECOMMEND TffiVT STEPS BE   .TAKEN TO RENDER NUGATORY AND TO PROHIBIT PROVISIONS IN CONVEYANCES, LEASESAND AGREEMENTS RELATING TO , LAND MICH STIPULATE THAT ONLY MEMBERS OF ONERACE,  COMMUNITY OR CREED&apos; Miff BE EMPLOYED ON OR ABOUT OR IN connection therewith.    (c) WE RECOMMEND THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD EXERCISE SUCHCLOSE SUPERVISION OVER THE HOLY PLACES AND LOCALITIES SUCH AS THE &apos; SEA OF.GALILEE AND ITS VICINITY AS WILL PROTECT THEM FROM DESECRATION AND FROM    .USES WHICH OFFEND THE CONSCIENCE OF RELIGIOUS PEOPLE; AMD THAT SUCH LAWSAS ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS PURPOSE BE ENACTED FORTHWITH.COMMENT.The Land Transfers Regulations of 1940 sought to protect the Arabtenant said small owner by prohibiting the sale of land save to a PalestinianArab in one zone, by restricting- such sales in another, and allowingunrestricted sale of land only in the third zone.   Their effect has been/ sue h ....   &apos;
CHAPTER I.   Pago -11.-such as to amount to discrimination against the Jews; their tendency is tosegregate and keep separate Arabs and Jews.   In the zones where sales arcprohibited or restricted, they have protected the Arab from the temptation to dispose of his land,  on which his livelihood and that of his family so often depend, for a sum out of all proportion to its real value.    Thoughmade with the object of maintaining the existing.standard of living of Arabcultivators,  and of preventing the creation of a considerable landless arab population, they afford no protection to the Arab living in the free zone.He may sell his land&apos; for a fantastic price and add to the congestion in theother zones by moving there.    An Arab living a short distance away, justacross; the zone boundary,  cannot obtain anything approximating the same sum for land&apos;&apos; of equal quality.We are opposed to any legislation or restrictions discriminating againstJew- or Arab.   We recognise the need for protecting the Arab small owner and tenant, for providing against a largo landless Arab population, for maintainsing, indeed for raising the Arab standard of living.    This necessity was also recognised in the Peel Report (Chapter IX, paragraph 10) which endorsed thefollowing principles of earlier reports, that (i) unless there is a markedchange in the methods of cultivation the land in Palestine is unable tosupport a large increase in population,  and (ii) there is already congestionon the land in the hill districts.    Those principles arc as- true,  if nottruer,  today.We do not believe that the necessary protection for the Arab can beprovided only by confining the Jew to particular portions of Palestine. Sucha policy,  suggested by the Peel&apos;Ccejmission, Is consistent with their proposedsolution, partition, but scarcely with that put forward by us.The leases granted by the Jewish National Fund contain a provision thatno labour other than Jewish shall be employed by the lessee on or about orin connection with the land subject to the lease,  and a further provision that a sub-lease shall contain similar terms.As we have said we are opposed to such discrimination.    We appreciate that one of the reasons for such provisions was: to secure employment forJowish immigrants on the &quot;land,    we do not think that that object justifiesthe retention of such stipulations which are harmful to .co-operation andunderfstanding between Arab and Jew./Land ....
CHAPTER. X.   Pago 12.Land acquired by the Jewish National Fund pr for a Waqf by theSupreme Moslem Council becomes inalienable.   The Peel Commission expressedthe view In its Report (Chapter IX, paragraph 80) that caution en the partof the Government in disposing of State domain to these bodies was dosir-able.    The situation requires watching.    It would hot be to the interestsof the inhabitants of Palestine if too large a proportion of the land should become inalienable whether held by one organisation or another.In the small, thickly populated country of Palestine, with, itsrapidly increasing population, it is In the interest; of Jews raid Arabsalike that all land should be developed and put to the fullest possible use.    The settlement of title to land should proceed as quickly as possible and the development of State lands, not required for public purposes and capable of use,  should be facilitated.The Holy Land of Palestine contains within its &quot;borders and through--,out its territories places sacred to the followers of throe great religions.The &quot;Lido&quot; .with its dancing and swing music on the shore of the Sea ofGalilee offends the sensibilities of many Christian people.   Reports cometo our notice of other projects the completion of which would be equallyobjectionable..   We therefore feel it right by our recommendation toemphasise the necessity for close supervision and to recommend the strengthening of the law should that be required.RECOMMENDATION No.8.    VARIOUS PLANS FOR LARGE-SCALE AGRICULTURAL ANDINDUSTRIAL. LEVELOPMENT IN PALESTINE HAVE BEEN PRESENTED FOR OUR CONSIDER-ATION; THESE PROJECTS, IF SUCCESSFULLY CARRIED INTO EFFECT, COULD NOT ONLYGREATLY ENLARGE THE CAPACITY OF THE COUNTRY TO SUPPORT AN INCREASINGPOPULATION, BUT ALSO RAISE THE LIVING STANDARDS OF JEW AND ARAB ALIKE.HE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO ASSESS THE SOUNDNESS OF THESE SPECIFICPkJNS; BUT WE CANNOT STATE TOO STRONGLY THAT, HOWEVER TECHNICALLY FEASIBLETHEY MAY BE, THEY T/ILL FAIL UNLESS THERE IS PEACE IN PALESTINE.    MOREOVERTHEIR FULL SUCCESS REQUIRES THE WILLING CO-OPERATION OF ADJACENT arab states,. SINCE THEY ARE NOT MERELY PALESTINIAN PROJECTS.    WE RECOMMENDTHEREFORE THAT THE EXAMINATION, DISCUSSION AND EXECUTION OF THESE PLANSBE CONDUCTED,&apos; FROM THE START AND THROUGHOUT,  IN FULL CONSULTATION ANDCO-OPERATION NOT ONLY WITH THE JEWISH AGENCY BUT ALSO WITH THE GOVERNMENTSOF THE NEIGHBOURING ARAB STATES DIRECTLY AFFECTED./COMMENT ....
CHAPTER I.   Page 1.5.COMMENT.The &quot;building of the Jewish economy has enjoyed the advantage of abundantcapital, provided on such terms as to make economic return a secondary con-si deration.    The Arabs have had no such advantage.    In principle, wc do notthink it wise or appropriate that plans,  such as the project for a jordan valley Authority,  should, if judged technically sound, be undertaken by any private organisation, even though that organisation, as suggested by theJewish Agency,  should give on assurance of Arab benefits and Arab participa-tion in the management.Such proposals, by reason of their magnitude and far-reaching effects,should be conceived as public projects,  suitable for Government enterprise and accepted only provided that they arc calculated to benefit all parts ofthe population,   But the undertaking of a worth-while project should not behold up merely from financial considerations which could be overcome with the aid of semi-philanthropic resources.    Some compromise should not be .impoasiblc which would combine Jewish finance with Government-responsibility and control.We welcome the knowledge that the Government of Palestine has itselfprepared programmes of post-war development; we could wish that means mightbe found for projects of larger range and on a more ambitious scale; but wcrecognise that until political, peace is restored there is great dijffioultyin raising the necessary funds whether from revenue or. borrowing.Meanwhile it is suggested that the Government should acquire powers, atpresent lacking, to investigate fully the extent of the country&quot;^ waterresources, to control the use of underground water and to determine rights to surface water.We doubt whether Palestine can expand its economy.to the full, having,regard to its limited natural resources, without a full and free interchange of goods and services with neighbouring countries.   .In s me respects, indeed,as in certain jrrojects involving water supply, their active collaboration is indispensable to full development on on economic basis.Tho rom rval of Article 18 of the Mandate would clear:the way to those,- -comprehensive tariff and trade agreements, not conflicting with aky intor-national obligations that might be accepted by the Mandatory or Trustee, whichcould ultimately lead to some tiling like a customs union - an objective already in mind as between the surrounding countries of the Arab League./EDUCATION ____

They have become most effective agencies forinculcating a spirit of aggressive Hebrew nationalism.   Wo would urge most strongly that adequate control must bo exercised by the Government over theeducation of both Jews and Arabs, in order to do away with the present excited.,emphasis on racialism and the perversion of education for propaganda, purposes.The Government should ensure, by a careful supervision of text books andcurricula, and by inspection of schools that education contributes to theconciliation of the two peoples.We believe further that a larr-;e shar-c of responsibility for ArabJeducation might well be assumed by an Arab community,  similar to the jewish community already established in Palestine.   But if the Arab and Jewishcommunities are to set themselves the goal of compulsory education, a much higher proportion of the annual Palestinian budget must be devoted to education than heretofore, mast of which will be spent on Arab education.This will only be possible if the proportion of the budget now devoted to security can be substantial ly reduced.We would also stress the urgent necessity of increasing the facilitiesfor secondary, technical and university eduontxori available to Arabs.    the disparity between the standard of living of the two peoples, to which wo havealready drawn attention, is very largely due to the fact that the Jewishprofessional mod middle class so largely outnimibcrs that of the Arabs.

C H A PTE RTHE POSITION OE THE JEWS IN EUROPE31   ulWe arc required in paragraph 2 of our Terms of Reference &quot;to examine the positionhe Jews in those countries in* Europe whore they have been the victims, of Nazi andfascist persecution,  and the practical measures taken or contemplated to be taken inthose countries to enable them to live free from discrimination and oppression, and toitlake estimates of those who wish or will be impelled by their conditions to migrate toIfalestine or other countries outside Europe&quot;.I.    In order to fulfil our task within the allotted period of 120 days and on accountIf the urgency of. the problem, we divided into Sub-Committees, which between the 5thInd 2.8th February,  1946, visited the American, British and French zones of Germany and-Austria.    Sub-Committees also visited France, Poland, Czccho-Slovakia, Italy, Greecefind Switzerland.   Circumstances did not permit us to go to Hungary, Roumania, Yugo-ilavia, Bulgaria or the Russian zone of Austria., and we did not visit the Russian zoneIf Germany after we were informed by the Deputy Commander of tho Soviet occupation$forces that in that area there was no special Jewish problem.m:f.     There are about 98,000 Jews from other&apos;countries - displaced persons - now living in Gcmany, Austria and Italy, and a small additional number scattered throughout theCountries of Europe.    We found that the majority of these Jews in the American and* British zones of Germany and Austria wore living in assembly centres,  once known as&quot;camps&quot; whore accommodati m and maintenance wore provided by the military authorities.The Jewish occupants of these centres arc not all &quot;displaced persons&quot;, that is to say,gersons out-aide their national boundaries by reason of the war.&apos;   Since the end of thefar there has been a. very considerable movement of Jews into the American and BritishBanos;.of Germany and Austria.    It is estimated that,  so far,  some 30,000 have come from poland.    Thorn has also been some migration, though on a smaller scale, from Roumaniaana Hungary; this shows signs of increasing.   Since wo left Europe there has been a-slight restriction in the movement of migrants generally, but the possibility that&quot;here may be a considerable increase in the months to come must be borne in mind.The officer commanding the American Forces suggested the following as the reasonsfjr the movement into the American zone of. Germany: the expectation of generous treatment,BP&quot;3 probability of finding relations there, the special activity in America on behalf ofgo wish, &quot;relief, and the feeling that the American zone was on. the shortest route to&apos;^a^es^110,   Detailed information covering the position of Jews in European countries is Giver, in Appendices II and III.

CHAPTER II. Page 2.

The nature of the accommodation of displaced Jews differed widely in character. In some centres barracks were used; in others, huts, hotels, apartment houses and cottages. For example, in Hohne, commonly referred to as Belsen, in the British zone of Germany where 9,000 Jews were accommodated, the buildings were barracks formerly occupied by a unit of the German Army. At Bindermickel, in the American zone of Austria, flats built to house workers in the neighbouring Goering factory had been taken over, and in the south of Italy entire seaside villages had been made available for that purpose.

5. In the American and British zones, where the bulk of those persons were found, they were accommodated in separate centres from other displaced persons, or segragated voluntarily within a centre. The maximum of self-administration is encouraged and there is usually a centre committee which is responsible for directing group activities and for dealing with complaints. In many centres the occupants have their own courts for dealing with offences and their own police.

6. UNRRA has taken an increasing part in the relief and rehabilitation of these Jews.

In the autumn of 1944, it began to operate in Italy, and in February, 1945, took over administrative responsibility for the larger centres in the south of Italy. In the summer and latter part of 1945, it was assisting the Army in the American zones of Germany and Austria. At the end of February last, UNNRA assumed responsibility for the internal administration of Hohne and it now administers other centres in the British and French zones of Germany and of Austria.

Most centres in the United States zones are now operated by UNRRA teams as agents for the Army, which provides the accommodation, food, clothing and medical supplies. Voluntary agencies specially concerned with Jewish persons have been invited by military authorities and UNRRA to give assistance and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, the Jewish Agency, and the Jewish Committee for Relief Abroad now have representatives in the centres. The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee provides specialists to assist with health, welfare and other services such as the supply of Kosher food, clothes, and material for spiritual and educational life. The Jewish Agency furnishes rehabilitation and resettlement services, particularly in regard to problems concerning projected emigration to Palestine.

7. We saw many conditions in the centres that might be criticised, owing to circumstances which were not always within the power of the military authorities to improve. There were lack of furniture, unsatisfactory cooking arrangements, overcrowding and a shortage of beds and bedding. We have no doubt that many of these conditions have been remedied ....


CHAPTER IX.   Pnraj..JV.-rJ:;-^..^.......vreraodioer-^^ -fetus .whoio1iactr^&amp;-cff^ of our&apos; authorities to do ovcr$)ithing possible towards the well-being of these unfortunate people.   Nevertheless^.at thebest, most of tho centres could not be more than the place in which the occupants weregiven shelter, . food end clothing.    T/hLle everything possible was being done for theirphysical needs, there was little that could be done to improve their morale o.nd relievotheir mental anguish.    Coming from the horrors of Nazi persecution, it was evident thatthey still felt themselves outcasts and unv/antcd.It is perhaps unfortunate in some respects that nearly all of these settlementswere in enemy territory.    The displaced Jews sec around them Germans living a-familylife in their own homos and outwardly little effected by the war, while they, usuallythe last surviving menbers of their families, arc living still, as it seemed to them,under restrictions.8.      On tho whole, having regard to the many problems with which they have had to contendwe feel that military authorities, UNRRA, and the various relief organisations concerned have every reason to be proud of what they have done to succour these, remnants of Nazipersecution.    In particular, we would like to pay  :cr tribute to the men and women whoarc working, so often in such depressing circumstances to alleviate the sufferings ofthese unfortunate people.9.     In the cold print of a report it is not possible accurately to portray our feelingswith regard to tho suffering deliberately inflicted by the Germans on those Jews whofell into their hands.    The visit of our Sub-Conmittoe to the Ghetto in Warsaw has lefton their minds on impression which will forever remain.    Areas of that city on whichformerly stood large buildings core now o. mass of brick rubble,  covering the bodies ofnumberless -unknown Jews.    Adjoining the Ghetto there still stands an old barracks used as a place for killing Jews.    Viewing this in the cold grey light of a February day one could imagine the depths of human suffering there endured.    In the courtyards of the barracks were pits containing human ash and human bones.    The effect of that place onJews who came scorching, so often in vain, for any trace of their dear ones, can beleft to the imagination.When we remember that at Maidanek and Oswiocim and many other centres a deliberatepxLicy of extermination, coupled with indescribable suffering, was inflicted upon, theJews,  of whom it is estimated that certainly not le ;o. than five millions perished, v/ecan well understand and sympathise with the intense: desire of the survivinp: Jews to depart from localities so full of such poignant memories.    It must also be understoodthat this happened in what woro. rogordod as civilized communities./10. There
if!CHAPTER II.    Page 4.10.    There can scarcely be a Jew in Europe who has net suffered in greater or less degree either himself or herself or by the loss of relatives.   Many non-Jews of allnationalities also suffered in the concentration camps and many of them died.    Thisnust not be forgotten.    We are concerned in this Report with the living survivors ofSurqpeon Jewry.   We could harrow the feelings of those who read.,this Report by repetition of accounts we received of German frightfulness.   We do not propose to do so.    We wishto present a picture of the general situation as we saw it.   Eew of the aider peoplesurvived; not many children, for special efforts seem to have been made to destroy them.The majority of the children who survived are orphans.    The 3najority of the remainingsurvivors are young and middle-aged people.    The latter escaped death only by theirstrong physique enabling them to sustain either the ordeals of forced labour in concen-tration camps,  or the privations accompanying hiding.    The young people have had little .or no education save that of cruelty.    It is not too much to say that they all owe their lives to liberation by the United Nations.11.   These Jewish survivors have not emerged from their ordeals unscathed citherphysically or mentally.    It is rare indeed to find a complete Jewish family.    Those whoreturn to their old homes find them destroyed or occupied by others, their businessesgone or else in other hands.   They search for relatives, frequently undertaking long .journeys on hearing a rumour that one has been seen in another- part of the country orin another contre.   Such was the system of the Germans that.it is difficult fox- themever to establish the death of their dear ones.    They care faced also with very great difficulties In securing tho restitution of their property.   In Gci-many and in Poland,which was often described to us as &quot;the cemetery of European 1 Jewry&quot;,  a Jew may see &apos;in,;I the face of any man he looks upon the murderer of his family.   It is understandable thatfew find themselves able to face such conditions.12.   In Poland, Hungary and Roumania, the chief desire is to got out, to get away some-I where where there is a chance of building up a new life, of finding some happiness, ofliving in peace and in security.    In Germany also, where the number of Jews has been.000/deduced from about 500,000 in 1933 to about 20,000 now, and most traces of Jewish lifehave been destroyed, there is a similar desire on the part of a large proportion of the survivors to make a homo elsewhere, preferably in Palestine&apos;.    In Czecho-Slovakia,particularly in Bohemia and Moravia, and in Austria, the position in regard to theW ^establishment of the Jewish populations is more hopeful.    The vast majority of theiJcvdsh displaced persons and migrants, however, believe that the only place which offersr Prospect is Palestine./13. Whatever ...
CHAPTER II-, -Pago 5*..Wh.a ever--the T3reTd.oua--posi.tion in life of those in the centres, from a Judge in &apos;Memo I to a. young; man who by reason of ye:ars-of persecution has never been able to earn,his livelihood, there is the widespread feeling that they have&apos;been brought to the same level of -mere existence and homelessnCss.    The first sense of happiness, followingrelease from concentration camps and slave labour,  has passed. - How they arc conscious,^only of the constraint &apos;of their camp life,  even though it is under new and more favour-able conditions.14-    Work to them is associated with concentration camps and slave labour.    Their aimthen had been to do as little as they&apos;could to assist their persecutors, and now theyarc unwilling to engage in any activity which is not designed to fit. them for a new-life in Palestine.   Even though they have spent a considerable time In a centre, they still regard themselves as merely in transit to- that country and,  generally speaking,show little willingness even to assist in improving the conditions in which they are living.    Often their days- arc spent in aimless wandering around..   On the other hand,wherever-facilities ore provided for practical training for life in.Palestine theyeagerly take advantage of them.15&apos;    We were deeply impressed &quot;by the tragedy of the situation of these Jewish survivorsin the centres and by the tragedy of their purposeless existence.   Many months have-passed since they -wore freed from Nazi oppression and brutality, but they themselvesfeel that they are as far as ever from restoration to normal life.   We consider thatthose men, women and children have a. moral claim on the civilized world.    Their pitiablecondition has evoked a world-wide sympathy, but sympathy has so far- taken the form only of providing them with the ba.ro essentials of food, clothing and shelter.    It seems tothorn that the- only real chance of rebuilding their shattered lives and of becoming normaon and women again is that offered by the Jewish people in Palestine.   Even though manymight be glad to join relatives and friends in other&apos; countries:, the doors of those-countries at present appear to bo closed to.them.    They are resentful because they arcprevented from going to Palestine.    In the meantime,  as time passes, the mow ties betwoe;-*-hose who are sharing this common frustration become stronger and,  obsessed by their-parent rejection by other- peoples of the world, their firm desire is to remain togcthcin the future.    It is this sense of cohesion, born of caramon -suffering, which doubtless-ccounts for, if it does not wholly excuse, the firm-resistonco offered to proposals bycompetent b*dics to &quot;remove&apos; young children to happier surroundings in other countries for-.arcful rehabilitation.   Men and &quot;women arc marrying in the centres in increasing number,nd, together with other- members of the centre comraunities, they wait with growingimpatience for the time when they can go to the only friendly place they know./&quot;16. If, as

Jewish displaced persons centres and thereby discourage the furthermigration of Jews-in. Europe.    Jews have wandered through Europe almost as they wish,from centre to centre, zone. .to zone, and country to country.    Such movements have addedto the difficulty of tracing relatives, as has the practice,  acquired by some duringthe war,  of using various names.    They have also imposed a heavy burden on the author-ities who have constantly had to improvise reception arrcgigomcnta.   Stabilisation willgive sympathetic governments a better opportunity of implementing national, schemes ofresettlement and will encourage the Jews themselves to give more careful considerationto such opportunities.   Moreover, the resources of the Allied Military Authorities arclimited and it is necessary that their commitments in connection with refugees boreduced. -v.&quot;17.   Wc have also been asked to examine &quot;the practical measures taken or contemplatedto be taken in those countries to enable them to live free from discrimination andoppression&quot;.    The Governments of the countries we visited expressed their oppositionto anti-Semitism, but this is a poison which after years cf infection takes time toIeradicate,    wc hope thai their efforts will be successful.   We would urge also that theunited Nations should exert all possible pressure in Germany and Austria, to eliminateall trace of discrimination against Jews or resistance to their rehabilitation.Mo.   Further, a. most important practical step that con be taken to assist the Jews injpurope who wish to remain is to secure the speedy restitution of their property.   Werealise that there arc difficulties, but none the less wo de not think that all that is;loss.s by-umber,possible is being done.   Some governments have passed tho necessary legislation; othersIre about to do so or have just done so.   Many months have passed since the war hasiKdcrl and from our inquiries it appears that only a few Jews have yet recovered what ispopcrly theirs.Further, wo think that the governments of thn noiin tries where the Jews were pcrse-Bitea should themselves provide assistance in the rb-6sta&amp;lishira-tut of bh*ao Jews whoBok to remain.

They will be encouraged cither toresettle themselves in Europe, if that is possible,  or wait patiently in theirrespective countries until their time has come to leave.

B   The conflictis primarily political,  though the fear of economic subjection to the Jews is alsoin Arab minds        The conflict, indeed, is as much about the future as.about thepresent.    Every intelligent Arab and Jew is forced to ask the question Who in theend will govern Palestine?&apos;  ... for iriternal and external reasons it seems probablethat the situation, bad as it now is, will grow worse.    The conflict will go on,the gulf between Arabs and Jews &quot;Will -widen&quot;.    The Report concluded with a referenceto &quot;strife and bloodshed in a thrice hallowed land.&quot;2.        It is nine years since the Peel Commission made its report.   The recommenda-tions were unfulfilled, but the analysis of political conditions remains valid andimpressive.    The gulf between the Arabs of Palestine and the Arab world on the one side, and the Jews of Palestine and elsewhere on the other has widened still further.Neither side seems at all disposed at the present to make any sincere effort to reconcile either their superficial or their fundamental differences.   The Arabsview the Mandatory Government with misgivings end anger.    It is not only condemned:verbally, but attacked with bombs and firearms by organised bands of Jewish terrorists.The Palestine Administration appears to be powerless to keep the situation under control except by the display and use of very large forces.    Even if the total man-power in police and defence services were only half what it is reputed to be,  thepolitical implications 7/ould still be deeply disturbing.    It reflects the honestj fear of experienced officials that tomorrow may produce circumstances in whichmilitary operations will be necessary.3.        Official data imply the gravity of the menacing problem.   They show that,apcart from those convicted of terrorist activity,  the number of Jews held on! suspicion averaged 450 during most of the year 1945 and was 554 at the end of theI year.    The aggregate of persons in the whole-time police and prisons service of(Palestine in 1945 Was about 15,000/4. The,..I+jK During our visit to Palestine and in the preparation of this Report, we were     greatly assisted by the two volumes of the Survey of Palestine which theI     Government compiled at short notice for our use,  and which contain a great dealof new statistical and other information.

CHAPTER III Page 2

4. The financial tables provide additional evidence of the extent to which the energies and money of the Government are devoted to the protection of life and property. About L.P. 4,600,000+ ($18,400,000) was spent on "law and order" during the financial year 1944/45 as against L.P. 550,000 ($2,200,000) in health and L.P. 700,000 ($2,800,000) on education. Thus even from a budgetary point of view Palestine had developed into a semi-military or police state. But, pending a substantial change in the relations between the Government and the Jews and the Arabs, the prospect of the kind of budget which characterises a settled, civilised, non-garrisoned and prosperios community is dark.

5. Arab political leadership is still in the hands of the small number of families which were prominent in Ottoman times, of which the most notable are the Husseinis. This family controls the most important of the Arab political parties, the Palestine Arab Party, which was formally organised in 1935. The objectives of this and of all Arab parties in Palestine are the immediate stoppage of Jewish immigration, the immediate prohibition of the sale of land to Jews, and the concession of independence to a state in which the Arab majority would be dominant.

6. There has been no evidence that the Arab notables who appeared before the Committee, and whom the Committee visited in several countries, did not reflect accurately the views of their followers. The Arabic press, for example, protests as vehemently as Arab spokesmen against a Jewish influx of any kind, even if the certificates for admission were confined to old men and women and to children rescued from German death camps. In short, absolute, unqualified refusal of the Arabs to acquiesce in the admission of a single Jew to Palestine is the outstanding feature of Arab politics today; and the newly-formed parties of the Left, based on the embryonic trade union movement, display as intransigent a nationalism as the old leaders.

7. An additional reason for the insistence of the Palestinian Arabs on immediate independence is their desire for full membership in the newly formed Arab League. The Arabs of Palestine believe themselves to be as fitted for self-government as are their neighbours in Syria and Lebanon who obtained their independence during the Second World War, and in Trans-Jordan which has since become an independent State. The formation of the Arab League has given Arab leaders in Palestine a greater confidence. They feel that the support of the whole Arab world for their cause has now been mobilised. Furthermore, the presence in the United Nations of five Arab States one of ...

The description is even more accurate, today.   The Agency is now generally believed: to have unofficial, but none the less powerful, influence overHaganah - the .so-called Jewish Army d;the strength of which is estimated as over .....6o,000, The Jews credit the Agency with most of the improvements in Palestine sine6the First World War. ; Unquestionably it has been a tremendous power for good and has been indispensable to their pro tec tier, and progress, /11.

CHAPTER III Pose   L,11- But the Agency has become so powerful and its prestige has been so farenhanced by its accomplishments,  that its firm refusal to&quot;oo-operate In;carrying&apos;outthe White Paper has caused the Government how to regard it as &quot;a distinctly dangerous &apos;influence.   Viewed from the at and-point of the Palestine Government/&apos;it appears as&apos;a force for disunity, partly for reasons outside the Agency&apos;s bontfol/ partly by&apos;   -reason of its own activities.    It had been a party to activities calculated to lead  .to estrangement between the Yishuv on the one hand and the Palestine Governmentand the Mandatory rn the other,  and to the consolidation of active resistance by theYishuv to the Government1 s authority.    These&apos;&quot;activities have&apos;undermined&apos;the authorityof the Administratione ...12, Many criticisms of the Jewish Agency have been made before the Committee in open and closed sessions, by Arabs and officials of the Palestine Government as wellas by Agudath Israel and some individual Jews.   The Agency&apos;s customary functions,which are centred on the establishment, maintenance and growth of a National- home for Jews, were not condemned.    That is easily explainable, for it has been one of &apos;the most successful colonising instruments in history.    But the present relationsbetween the Government and the Jewish Agency must be corrected if the general welfareis to be promoted and the cause of peace in that crucial area of the world is to be protected.    Unless this is achieved, Palestine might well be plunged into a civil war, involving the whole Middle East.13.        Neither Jews nor Arabs have been included in the highest ranks of theadministration,    British officials hold all the important positions.   They exerciseas much authority as in a country where the mass of the inhabitants are in aprimitive stage of civilisation.

CHAPTERI y.GEOGRAPHY   AMI)&apos; BCOHOMICS.Geography.Palestine, about the size of Wales or the State of Vermont^ is geograpb-ically an integral part of Syria,  having no natural frontier on the north.A marked natural division within the country separates the rich soil of the coastalstrip and the plain of Esdraelon from the rocky mountain areas, parched for a largeare thriving towns - Acre, Haifa, Tel-Aviv, Jaffa and Gaza - with ports and a variety of industries.     Here, moreover, is to be found intensive cultivation, byArab and Jews like, with attention concentrated on the old and profitable pursuit ofcitrus growing..   &apos; The mountains contain not only desolate areas of barren rock anddeforested hillside, but also fertile valleys and basins where cereals are grown;in addition remarkable results have been achieved in the cultivation of olives,vines and fruit trees on tiny terraced strips constructed and maintained with greatpatience-and skill.       In summer the hills are dry.     In winter heavy rains tearaway soil from every hillside that is not adequately protected by terracing orforest cover, and constant warfare has. to be carried on against erosion.2.        Nearly;all the Jews of Palestine and almost half the Arabs live in theplains, though these contain less than one-seventh of the total area of Palestine,while the mountains and the southern deserts are populated, apart from scatteredJewish colonies, exclusively by Arabs.     Both Arab and Jew put forward.historicaland cultural claims tD the whole of Palestine, and even the great deserts to thesouth, almost rainless and with more rock-, than soil, are not uncontested. :  With asmall, semi-nomadic or nomadic Arab population, their emptiness appears to the.Jewsas a challenge to their powers of colonisation;    and, despite the unpromising&apos; out-look on any economic test, the Arabs regard proposals for Jewish settlement as yetfurther evidence of the well-planned &quot;creeping conquest&quot;.     Geography, indeed, portlyexplains the intransigent claims of both sides to the whole country.       The plainsare too small and the mountains too poor to subsist as independent economies.3. The significance of Palestine in international affairs, apart from its possible strategic importance,  derives largely from the fact that it lies acrossthrough the country.     It is on the route between two great centres of Arab culture,/Cairo and part of the year, and from the southern deserts.In the wide coastal plain therenatural lines of communication.Major railway and road communications pass

Palestine is also deeply-involved in the business and ftpolitics of the- international trade in oil,    for, although there are no xvells in thecountry, a pipe-lino delivers;, a stream of crude oil to the great refineries at. Haifa;and.from there tankers.deliver it to countries around and beyond the Mediterranean;The American concession in Saudi Arabia may produce another stream converging onmuch the same point of distribution.       -Population.4.       According to official estimates, the population of Palestine grew from 750,000at the census of 1922 to 1,765,000 at the end of 1944.       In this period the Jewishpart of the population rose from 84,000 to 554,000 and from 13 to 31 per cent,  of thewhole.     Three-fourths of this expansion of the Jewish community was accounted for byimmigration.     Meanwhile the Arabs, though their proportion of the total populationwas falling, had increased by an even greater number - the Moslems alone from 589,000to 1,061,000\     Of this Moslem growth by 472,000, only 19,000 was accounted for byimmigration.     The expansion of theArab community by natural increase has been in fatone of the&apos;.most striking features of Palestine&apos;s social history under the Mandate,5, The present density of population in Palestine is offically estimated at179 per square mile.     If the largely desert sub-district of Beersheba is excludedfrom the calculation, the figure is 336.6, The Committee obtained- estimates of the probable future growth of Palestino&apos;spopulation from Profess or Notestein, Director of the Office of Population Researchat Princeton University, from Dr. D. V. Glass, Research Secrerary of the PopulationInvestigation Committee In London, and in Palestine from the Commissioner forMigration and Statistics and the Government Statistician.     ,The estimates for thenon-Jewish population made by the last-named,  on various hypotheses but with the constant assumption that there would be no non-Jewish immigration or emigration,4-     It is difficult to estimate the Arab population precisely, as the official     ^statistics are compiled on a religious basis and a small proportion of the christian population is not ^rab.

Professor Notestein, alsoassuming the absence of non-Jewish migration, extended his calculations to 1970 and arrived at a figure of 1,876,000.      The Commissioner for Migration predicted an arab population of 1,565,000 in 1960 and 1,820,000 in 1970.     The highest estimates were those of Dr. Glass, who anticipated a settled Moslem population (i.e.  excluding the christian Arabs)  of 1,636,000 in 1961 and 2,204,000 in 1971.     Por the probableJewish population at the end of 1959,  on the supposition that no immigration occurred in the interval,  the Government Statistician put forward the figure of 664,000.7. The Jewish community, in the absence of Immigration, would form a steadily  -diminishing proportion of the total population.     This is clear from the comparativerates of natural increase,  shown in the table below: -  .AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE OE NATURAL INCREASE PER 1,000Years. Moslems. Jews. Christians.1922/25 &apos;            23.27 20.44 .                                20.161926/30 25.19 22.70 20.60&apos;1931/35 24.97 20.91 20.851936/40 27.68 17.75 20.77&apos;1941/44 30.71 17.83 18.89The high Arab rate of natural increase is accounted for by a fertility whichis among the highest recorded in the world, and by the disappearance under theMandate of such counter-balancing factors as constription for the Ottoman army and. ahigh incidence of malaria.     The fact that the rate is still rising seems, to be. dueprincipally to declining mortality, particularly infant mortality. .Economic Contrasts.8. On the economic side Palestine is a country of marked contrasts.     While theArabs have remained preponderantly rural, in the Jewish sector, along with the &quot;closesettlement on the land&quot; which has been laid down as a guiding principle of Jewishcolonisation, there has been,  particularly in later years,  a remarkable industrialdevelopment.     Moreover, the new Jewish colonisation has assumed more and more the^character of a socialist experiment..:  For though at many points it retains, particu-larly in urban industry and trade,  the form of private enterprise, it is everywhere. .guided and supported -In finance, technical advice and other matters - by the great,complex of Jewish undertakings which co-operate in the building of the National Home.. v.    . &quot; -     A  - .    /9. ,    The       .....
CHAPTER   IV     -     PAGE   h-9. The passage of years has only sharpened the contrast in structure &quot;between thetwo economies.    On the Arab side, notwithstanding some development in co-operation and trade unionism, individualism is still characteristic.     In agriculture small-scale peasant farming, still largely on the subsistence principle, remains predominantand the many signs now visible of enterprise and expansion in Arab industry conform to the same pattern of strong1 individualism.     In the Jewish economy, on the other    ^hand, is to b&apos;e found a nexus of centralised control.       Thus the Jewish -Agency,besides being a landowner &apos;on a large scale, is a promoter and financier of agriculturalsettlement, and has large and varied participations in industrial and other enterprises,Histadfuth, which is closely associated with the Agency, is by no means simply a federation of workers&apos; unions. .   It is, in addition, a vast consumers&apos;  co-operativeorganisation;    it operates large contributory social services, including unemployment-insurance, and it has latterly become a capitalist employer, being the sole orcontrolling owner of a wide and ever-increasing range of industrial,  constructional,financial and service undertakings.       There have occurred lately several instances of members &quot;of Histadrutb, as a trade union, striking in a wage dispute againstHistadruth as owner of the employing business^10. Not to over-emphasis the cleavage,  it should be noted that there are points of contact between the Arab and Jewish economies, as in the Palestine Potash Works.. There is indeed some limited interdependence, where for example the Jewish housewifebuys vegetables from an Arab grower.     But there can be few instances of so small a country being so sharply divided in its economic,  let alone social and political, basijOnly in citriculture, which before the war provided the staple export of Palestine,do we find close association between the two sectors.     It is shared about equally between the two communities, and many Jewish citrus groves emplqy some irregular Arablabour.     Individualism is the characteristic form of enterprise in both sectors ofthe industry, though war-time difficulties have called for special measures ofGovernment assistance, which in turn hove tended to bring the two together in co-operative protective measures.11. Everywhere is to be seen a marked disparity between the standards of living,however measured,  of the Arab and Jewish communities.     Jewish wage rates are con-sistently higher than Arab, those for unskilled labour being more than twice as high.There is only a limited range of -competition between them;    and therefore a minimum of natural pressure towards equalisation.

The war has done little, if anything, to weaken the division.War-time Economic Developments.12. In recent years, the war and changes due to the war have been the mainv influences governing the standard of living and economic prosperity of both sectors.Though the margin between Jewish and Arab wage rates underwent in general little change, the incidence of taxation and rationing,  together with subsidies in aid oftho cost of living, tended to depress the higher Jewish standard Df living more thanthe Arab.Another result    of the war was that the Jewish sector of the economy became increasingly urban and industrial, while the Arab sector, notwithstanding the fullerutilisation of its limited industrial capacity, remained overwhelmingly agricultural.In both sectors, the Government took an increasingly active part in determining the shape and direction of economic effort.13.       The closing of the Mediterranean to Allied shipping cut Palestine off from thechief market for her citrus fruits and the chief source of her imported supplies.The spread of the war zone to the Middle East converted Palestine into a base as wellas an arsenal.        Large numbers of troops had to be quartered there.       Supplies of -food and other necessities of life and of war materials had to be provided locallyor imported where possible from neighbouring Middle East countries, themselves sub-jected by the same combination of causes to severe economic pressure.     Existingindustries were, as far and as fast as possible, redirected into war production.Established undertakings were enlarged and new ones set up, with support, in order tocontribute to the needs of the military campaign and build up a. higher degree of self-sufficiency.        In this development the variety of manufactures was broadened to-include a number of more complicated, mechanical and chemical processes.14. Thus. Palestine became an-important source of supply of manufactured goods notonly for. military purposes throughout the area but for civilian needs in surroundingcountries.      The skill and inventiveness of the Jewish immigrants of pre-war yearsproved an invaluable asset, and the directed effort was supported by the Jewish agency and the other established organs of Jewish settlement.       Notwithstanding the necessityof maximum food supply, the Jewish economy became still more concentrated uponindustrial activity, and &quot;close settlement upon the land&quot; was forced further intothe background as the ruling principle of expansion..&apos;, &apos; -v /15.     The
CHAPTER IV- ,   -    - PAGE 615.     The war had yet another distorting effect, which sprang       - ^&quot;from financial transactions.   Vast military expenditure inPalestine for &quot;both goods and civilian services, along with shortageof shipping and potential Inward cargoes,brought about a stringencyin supplies and in labour.     This resulted in rising prices, risingwage rates and still more rapidly rising earnings, large profits and a rapid.growth of money-wealth (including bank deposits andhoarded currency), shared by both the Jews and Arabs.     Taxationwas increased: but taxation and voluntary saving went only a small part of the way in draining off the flow of unspendable incomes.Rationing, so far as it was applied, failed to check with sufficientpromptitute the effects of competitive buying.      Subsidies in aid of the cost of. living were only successful in keeping a few bareessentials within the range of the poorest peoples1 resources.By allocating raw materials and by close costing of industrialprocesses, the Government kept a brake on the rise in prices of a wide range of military stores and essential civilian goods.    Butin general the Inflationary trend was restrained only to an extent that made Palestine&apos;3 experience less alarming than that-ofsurrounding countries.16.     As to external finances, whereas Palestine had been hithertonominally a debtor country - &quot;nominally&quot; in the sense that herdebtorshipon capital account did not entail the normal currentremittances&apos; on account of interest and amortisation - the vrar &apos;changed her status to that of a creditor.    The bulk of her overseasassets,  however, being confined within the sterling area,  cannot be converted into goods until Great Britain is once more able to resumea full flow of exports or to release sterling for transmutation atwill into !&apos;hard currencies&quot;.Post-war Prospects,17.      At the time of the Committee&apos;s investigations in Palestine,it could by no means be said that even the more transitory resultsof war pressures upon the economy had passed away.   The pattern    -  (of.the post-war economy is still undetermined - and this without allowing for the omnipresent uncertainty concerning the political&apos;&quot;&apos; &apos;/fut ure of.
CHAPTER IV        -       Pago 7future of the country.     Even before the war ended,&apos; war orders had fallen offsomewhat;   but the continued shortage of imported supplies has afforded a naturalprotection to industry in shifting the flow of its products into the civilian /(market,     .The Arab boycott of Palestine Jewish products had bad, when the Committeewas in the country, little effect thus far on the general economic situation. . no obvious unemployment had appeared, but some concealed unemployment was said to exist, and earnings of factory labour had probably diminished.    The cost of living and wage rates remain obstinately high,18. Ho use-building is slowly getting under weigh after the long interval -resulting in shocking congestion - which began with the disturbances- of 1936-39and continued throughout the war, when all constructional activity was concentrated upon military works.    There is,  however,  some natural hesitation in undertaking alarge building programme while costs remain so high.    Quite apart from the value ofland, which has risen inordinately in recent years, building materials are extremelyexpensive, while timber, nearly all of which has to be imported, is scarce.   As aresult of the shortage of skilled artisans,  some building operatives.are earningup to E.P.  3 a day, and, within recent times,  have secured additional benefitssuch as three weeks&apos;&apos; paid holiday and a pension scheme.    Building costs, therefore,are found to be roughly L.P.  20 a cubic metre - far higher than in Oreai..Britain.19.. The situation is, indeed, replete with elements of uncertainty.     There isfor one thing the question, debatable on pre-war experience, hew far the consolidationand further growth of. Jewish industry and trade are dependent upon maintenace ofthe momentum provided by continuing immigration.    It is a matter of conjectureI   &quot;whether the market as a whole is likely to shrink if more, peaceful conditions in theI   Middle East, or a change in political status, result in a large withdrawal of british     forces, including police and civilian residents,  and a consequent reduction ofI    incomes provided from abroad, though more peaceful conditions would on the otherhand induce a fuller flow of tourists.    Arising again-: from war-time. growth ofindustry is the question whether the high costs of production, ;and inferior quality of some products, in Jewish industry -will permit the establishment of a firmposition in the home market without inordinate protection.    There is the relatedquestion how far external markets can be retained - even allowing for specialadvantages in the new diamond-cutting industry and the: fashion and women&apos;sspecialty trades which together are thought to   have outstanding prospects for/yielding.,
yielding revenue from abf cad     in;the&apos; &apos;f ace &apos;of &apos; competition from advanced industrial countries-and possible continuation of the boycott of Jewish&apos; -products in neighbourinjArab States.   Again, even though internal conditions might become fully adjusted tothe inflated structure of prices and&apos; costs, the gross over-valuation of the &apos; ,... iPalestinian pound in relation to the pound sterling presents a further impedimentto successful competition in export markets and an added inducement to competitiveimports,20.        It.is sometimes claimed that the wage structure in Palestine is far moreelastic than elsewhere, so that reductions in wage-costs, and prices might proceedsmoothly and concurrently once the process had begun;    but the war-time wage     i .increases have been by no means wholly-in the&apos; form of cost-of-living bonuses - basicrises have been widespread and substantial.    The Committee could not but observe&apos;that at the time of its visit the cost-of-living index number still stood above250.as compared with a pre-war figure of 100;    that limited supplies of sometimesinferior butter were selling at the equivalent, of 11/- a pound, and that, in-oneof the factories visited, workers already receiving L.P. 12. a week were /putting In60 instead of the standard 48 hours in order to- make ends meet.    It remains to beseen whether the claim of elasticity will be falsified by wide spread resistance todownward adjustment of wagd rates.    Some take the view&apos;that increased immigration...and a free flow of imported supplies will &quot;automatically&quot;, precipitate such a fallin wages and. prices as will substantially reduce costs of production and bring thocost of living down to something like the British level... Others complain that the government does nothing.to reduce the cost of living, without being quite sure: whatthe Government ought to dD about it.   Meanwhile political and other causes -hinderthe transformation of liquid savingsdnto long-term investment,  and the pressure oflarge unused or. unusable money resources, poured out in the process of financing thewar, is substantially, unrelieved, -b;Economic Expansion and Immigration21, Leaving aside-these,uncertainties of.the moment, there can be little doubtthat,, given some central direction, more co-operative effort, and a peacefulpolitical atmosphere, Palestine couldbe made to, provide further opportunities forprosperous settlement, concurrently with an. improvement in the living standards ofits present population.    Some progress towards.central direction .was made understress of War, and arrangements are in hand-to provide for its continuance.

Souse witnesses have been severelycritical of the Administration for lack of vision and unreadiness to give, positivesupport-to proposals for expansion.    Others have expressed the view that monetaryindependence would clear the way to more vigorous public and. private enterprise,&apos;Opinion has been almost unanimous as to the cramping effects of Article 18 of the&apos;Mandate; which restricts the exercise of tariff-making and bargaining power in theinterests of the mandated territory.   Conflicting views are held on the questionwhether;the citrus industry will be able to regain, or even possibly to expand,its pre-war markets.    Some see Palestine&apos;s future in the establishment of -the coastalfringe7 as the industrial workshop of the Middle East; &quot;some stress, the;need of an expansion nicely balanced between agriculture and industry, . -23,    -  Any forecast of Palestine1 s long-term prospects must necessarily-be viewed&apos;&apos;against the background of the country&apos;s&apos; natural -resources.    These are extremelylimited, making Palestine peculiarly dependent on.foreign trade for raw: materials and supplies of many finished goods.   Even the exploitation of the. natural assetcomprised in a good soil irradiated by long hours of bright sunshine&apos; is limited by the availability of water.   Despite an abuudant winter rainfall in-many parts,Palestine is an arid&quot; country.    In the words of the Palestine Government, &quot;there are few countries nowadays which can say that their water resources -are. of such, littleconcern to their people that legislation to control their use is unnecessary&quot;; yet the Government of this arid country has no statutory authority to control the exploitation of its water resources, and no authority even to ascertain the extentof such water resources as exist.24.

The general: design. is to bring water, from the sources of the Jordan to the fertile Esdraelon and coastal plain, to irrigatethe lower Jordan Valley, and to -utilise the waters both of   the Jordan River and cthe Mediterranean Sea for the generation of electric power.

Very large sums of money&apos; would be; required, but these,  the Committee w-informed, would be available from external sources,25.        Such bold   long-term planning presupposes willing co-operation, or at leasInterested neutrality, between all sections of the population and the Government.Moreover, it can have little or no bearing on the capacity of Palestine to provide an-immediate haven of refuge for homeless Jews from Europe.26,        We have in this immediate &quot;context another example of the - manner in whichJewish zeal and energy are ready to outrun economic caution of the ordinary Wester!pattern.   Full recognition of the weak points in the Jewish economy .an&amp; its immediate prospects does not in the least deter the insistence - upon providing ahome for the homeless.   If this should- entail an all-round cut in standards ofliving of the present Jewish population, so be it.    There is much to admire in thidemonstration of brotherhood carried,  if need be,  to the point of sacrifice.    but is conceivable that the passionate expansion of an economic structure,  upon adubious basis of natural resources, might lead to over-development on such a scaleas to render it top-heavy to the point of collapse.    The argument thus returns tothe need for systematic improvement of the country&apos;s basic resources, for&quot; which,as already indicated,  orderly progress in an atmosphere of peaceful collaborationis a sine qua non. -
CHAPTER   V.THE   JEWISHATTITUDE1. The Committee he8rd the. Jewish ease, presented at full length and. withvoluminous written evidence, in three series of public hearings     in Washingtonby the American Zionists,  in London by the- British Zionists^  and finally and mostmassively by the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem,    The basic policy advocated Was always the same,  the.so-called Biltmore Programme - of 1942, with the additional demand that100,000 certificates; f or -immigration into Palestine should be issued immediately to relieve the distress in Europe,    This policy can be summed up in three points:(1) that the Mandatory, should hand over control of immigration&apos;&quot;tp the Jewish Agency;(2) that it should abolish restrictions on the sale of land;    and (3) that it shouldproclaim as its ultima&apos;-&quot;&apos; aim the establishment of a Jewish State as soon as a jewish majority has been achieved.    It should be noted that the demand for a jewish state goes beyond the obligations of either the Balfour Declaration or the Mandate,and was expressly disowned by the Chairman of the Jewish Agency as late as 1932,2, In all the hearings,  although evidence was given &quot;by those sections of the zionist movement which are critical of the Biltmore-Programme, most of the witnessestook the official Zionist line.    The Committee also hoard the Jewish opponents ofZionism:    first,  the small groups in America and Britain who advocate assimilationas an alternative to Jewish nationalism; &apos; second, Agudath Israel,  an organisation oforthodox Jens which, supports unrestricted Jewish immigration into Palestine whileobjecting to the secular tendencies of Zionism;    and third, representatives ofimportant sections of Middle Eastern Jewry, many- of Whom fear that their friendly relations with the Arabs are being endangered by political Zionism.3t As the result of the public hearings and of toany private conversations, we came, to the conclusion that the Biltmore programme has the support of the over-whelming majority of Zionists.    Though many Jews have doubts about the wisdom offormulating these ultimate demands,   the programme hss undoubtedly, won the supportof the Zionist movement as a whole, chiefly because it expresses the policy ofPalestinian Jewry which now plays a leading role in the Jewish Agency,    Whether thisalmost universal-support for the demand for a Jewish State is based on fuHH  knowledgeof the implications of the policy and of the risks involved in carrying it out is,of course,  quite another matter;. ... --   - /4.

CHAPTER   V logs.    24, The position in Palestine itself is somewhat different.    Here, where the issue is not the achievement of a remote idea, but is regarded as a matter of life anddepth for the Jewish nation, the position is naturally, more complex.   PalestinianJewry is riddled with party differences,   :The number of political newspapers and periodicals bears witness to the variety and vitality of this political life,  and,apart from pressure exerted on&apos;Jews considered to be disloyal to the National Home,we found little evidence to support the rumours that it was dangerous to advocateminority, views.    Of the major&apos;political parties, Map a i &apos;(theLabour Par ty) is far the biggest and largely determines the official line.  &apos; Opposed to the Agency&apos; s policy are two main groups.    On the one side stand two small but important parties: &apos; theConservative Aliyah &apos; Ha da shah (New Settlers), drawn chiefly from colonists of Germanand western European extraction,- and Hashomer Hatzair,  a socialist party which,while demanding the right of unrestricted immigration - and : land-, settlement, challengesthe.- concept of the Jewish State and particularly emphasises the need for co-operationwith the Arabs,    Hashomer Hatzair j  though it &quot;did riot appear, before us, published&apos;shortly before 7*?e left Jerusalem a. striking pamphlet in support of bi-nationallsm, &apos;Very close to Hashomer &apos;Hatzair,  but &quot;without its socialist ideology,  stands Dr,Magnes and his &quot;small I hud group,, whose importance   is-far greater than its numbers.Taken altogether,  these Palestinian critics of the Blitmore Programme certainly do -not exceed at the moment one quarter of the Jewish-population in Palestine,    But they represent a constructive minority. /5. On the other side stands Revisionist&apos;Party, numbering some one per cent,  ofthe Jewish community,  and beypjacl it the various&apos; more extreme groups, which&apos;call foractive resistance to the White Paper and participate in and openly support tile    -present terrorist campaign.    This wing of Palestinian Jewry derives its inspirationand its methods from the revolutionary traditions of Poland and eastern Europe.   Manyof these extremists are boys and girls under twenty, of good education, filled1 witha political fanaticism as self-sacrificing as it is pernicious,6,, The Biltraore Programme can only be fully understood if it is studied against this background of - Palestinian life.    Like all political platforms, it is a resultof conflicting political-pressures, an attempt by the leadership to maintain unitywithout sacrificing principle.    The Jew   who lives and works in the National Home isdeeply aware both of his achievements and,of how much more could&apos;have been achievedwith whole-hearted support by the Mandatory Power.    His political outlook is thus/a mixture, ,
a mixture of self-oonfideni pride and &quot;bitter frustration:    pride that he has turnedthe desert and the swamp into a land flowing with milk and honey;    frustrationbecause? he is denied opportunity of settlement in nine-tenths of that Eretz Israelwhich he considers his own by right;   pride that he has disproved the theory thatthe Jews cannot build a healthy community based on the tilling of the soil;frustration that the Je?; is barred entry to the National Home, where that community is now in being;   pride that he is taking part in a bold collective experiment;j frustration because he feels himself hampered by British officials whom he oftenregards as less able than himself;   pride because in Palestine he feels himself at last a free member of a free c0t7.-nuni.ty;    frustration because he lives, not undera freely elected government, but under an autocratic if humane regime,.7. The main complaint of the Jews of Palestine is that,  since the White Paper of1930,  the Mandatory Power has slowed up the development of the National Home inorder to placate Arab opposition.-   The sudden rise of immigration after the NaziI seizure of power had as its direct result the three and a half years of Arab revolt,during which the Jew had to trail himself for self-defence, and to accustom himself to the life of a pioneer in an armed stockade.    The high -barbed -wire and the v/atch-towers, manned by the settlement police day and night.  strike the eye of the visitoras he approaches every collective colony.    They are an outward symbol of the newattitude to life and politics which developed among the Palestinian Jews between1936 and 1938.    As a Jewish settler said to a member of the Committee:  &quot;We are thevanguard of a great army,  defending the advanced positions until the reinforcementsarrive from Europe8.        The Jews in Palestine are convinced that Arab violence paid.   Throughout the,Arab rising,  the Jews in the National Home,  despite every provocation,  obeyed theorders of their leaders and exercised a remarkable self-discipline, - They shot, butonly in self-defence;  they rare^ took reprisals on the Arab population,.    They state-bitterly that the reward for this restraint -was the&apos;Conference and the White paper of 1939,    The Mandatory Power,  they argue, yielded to force, cut down hnmigrationsfana thus caused the death of thousands of Jews in Hitler &apos;s gas chambers.    The Arabs,&quot;ho had recourse to violence, received substantial concessions, -while the Jews, Who3d put their faith in the Mandatory, were compelled&apos; to accept what they regard as. aInitiation of the spirit and the letter of the Mandate, - . * -
CHAPTER V EllElJb9.        An-immediate result of the success of Arab terrorism was the beginning of jewish terrorism and, even more significant, a closing of the ranks,  a tightening ofthe discipline,  and a. general militarisation of Jewish life in Palestine,    the agency become the political &apos;headquarters of a citizen army which felt that at any moment it might have to fight; for its very existence,,   Deprived, as he believedjboth of his natural and of his legal rights,  the Palestinian Jew began to lose faith in the Mandatory Power,    The tlahgerous belief was spread that not patience butviolence was needed to- achieve justice.    The position of the moderates who urgedself-restraint and.a reliance on Britain &apos;s pledged word was progressively undermined;the position of the extremists, eager to borrow a leaf from the Arab copy book, wayprogressively strengthened,10.       Then came the war.    Apart from a small group of -terrorists?, the Jewish cemmunitgave more solid support than the Palestinian Arabs&apos; to&apos;&apos; the&apos; British war -effort-    Butomen the immediate Middle Eastern danger was removed,  the old struggle&apos;between themoderates and the extremists began again, heightened to an almost unendurable tensionby the news from Europe and by such tragedies as the ^Struma incident,   During thewar,  tens of thousands of Jews learned to fight, either in the British Army or inthe Palestine Home Guard.    They were with Britain in the fight against Fascism:1 theywere against Britain in&apos; the. struggle against the White Paper, which they no-;/ felt&apos;&apos;was not only unjust but totally inhuman as preventing&apos;the-escape&apos; to&quot;&apos;Palestine of men,women and children in imminent danger of death in Nazi Germany and Nazi-con trolledEurope,   When the war ended and the Labour Government came to power,  the White Paperstill remained in force.  : The-Jews, who&apos;&apos;had expected an immediate fulfilment by a labour Government of the Labour Party programme with&apos;regard to Zionism, felt a sense of outrage when no change of policy occurred.    The bitterness reached a new peak ofintensity, and the position of the moderates became almost impossible.    The jewish agency frankly stated in public hearing that,  after V-E day, it was quite futile.-for it to attempt to co-operate, with-the Mandatory in suppressing illegal aotivooj:,ii.       Any decision on the future of Palestine will be futile and-unrealistic unless-it is made hi full cognisance- of the political tension among the Jews in Pale.;&apos;t,.iv.and the reasons for it. . Both in, evidence given in public hearings,  and in numerousprivate conversations with-leading- politioians and.-with ordinary1 citizens., we worerepeatedly advised that the, maintenance by the Mandatory of its present policy couldonly lead to a state of war,&apos;, in -which the extremists would have the passive supportof almost the whole Jewish population and the moderates would be swept from the key.,positions which they still hold. - ,To use.-.the words of one Jewish leader:    &quot;Ourpresent crisis in Europe and Palestine is felt by all of us to be our Dunkirko 11
CHAPTER     vi the ARAB ATTITUDE1 .        The committee heard a brief presentation of the Arab cose injiVashington, statements made in London by delegates from the /4rab states tothe United National a fuller statement from the secretary-General and other representatives of the Arab League in Cairo,  and evidence given on behalfof the Arab Higher committee and the Arab office in Jerusalem,    in addition,sub-committees visited Baghdad, Riyadh, Damascus, Beirut and Ai-iman, wherethey were informed of the views of Governments and cf unofficial spokesmen.2.      &apos; Stripped to the bare essentials, the Arab case is based upon thefact that Palestine is a country which the Arabs have occupied for morethan a thousand years, and a denial of the Jewish historical claims to palestine,    in issuing the Balfour Declaration, the Arabs maintain, the,J3*iti-s;h Government -were giving away something that did not belong to britain,  and they have consistently argued that the Mandate conflicted withthe Covenant of the League of Nations from which it derived its authority.The Arabs deny that the part played by the British in freeing them from theTurks gave Great Britain a right to dispose of their country^&apos;    indeed,they assert   that Turkish was preferable to British rule, if the latterinvolves their eventual subjection to the Jews.    They consider the Mandatea violation of their right of self-determination since it is forcing upon them on immigration which they do not desire and will not tolerate - an invasion of Palestine by the Jews.^ we have not felt it necessary to enter into the historical argumentsbased upon undertakings given by the British Government to the SharifHussein of Mecca and others during the last war and interpreted by the Arabsas promising among other things that Palestine - would become an independentArab country.   These undertakings, the most important of which preceded the balfour Declaration, form an essential port of the Arab case and were examined by an Anglo-Arab Committee in London in February, 1939.    The reportof this committee, containing statements of both the Arab and the british point of view, is to be found in British Command Paper No.5974*    The docu-ments under examination were printed at the some time.in Command papersNos.. 5957 and 59^4 (all of 1939)/3.   The Arabs

* CHAPTER   VI     -     Page 23.        The Arabs of Palestine point out that all the surrounding Arab States- have now been granted independence.   They argue that,, they are just asadvanced as are the citizens of the nearby states, and they demand inde-pendence for Palestine now.   The promises which have been made to them inthe name of Great Britain, and the assurances concerning Palestine given toArab leaders by presidents Roosevelt and Truman, have been understood by theArabs of Palestine as a recognition of the principle that they should enjoy the some rights as those enjoyed by the neighbouring countries.    ChristianArabs unite with Moslems in all of these contentions.   They demand that their independence should be recognised at once, and they would like Palestine, as.a self-governing country, to join the Arab League.4. The Arabs attach the highest importance to the fulfilment of thepromises made by the British Government ^in the white Paper of 1939*   KingAbdul Aziz ibn Saud, when he spoke with three members of the Committee atRiyadh,       ma do  frequent reference both to these promises and to the assurances given him by the late President Roosevelt at their meeting inFebruary, 1945.    His Majesty made clear the strain which would be placed uponArab friendship with Great Britain and the United States by any policy whichArabs regarded as a betrayal of. these pledges.   The same warning was repeatedby an Arab witness in Jerusalem, who said that &quot;Zionism for the Arabs hasbecome a test of Western intentions&quot;.5*        The suggestion that self-government should be withheld from Palestineuntil the Jews have acquired .a majority seems &apos;outrageous to the Arabs.   they wish to be masters in their own house.    The Arabs were opposed to the idea ofa Jewish National Home even before the Biltmore Programme and the demand fora Jewish State,   Needless to say, however, their opposition has become moreintense and more bitter since that programme was adopted.6.        The Arabs maintain that they have never been anti-Semitic;  indeed, they-are Semites themselves.    Arab spokesmen profess the&apos; greatest sympathy for thepersecuted Jews of Europe, but they point out that they have not been res-ponsible for this persecution and that it is not just that they should be compelled to atone for the sins of Western peoples by accepting into theircountry hundreds of thousands of victims of European anti-Semitism.    Some ./Arabs
1.1iCHAPTER   VI     -    Pg-ge 3Arob-s ewn aeclore that they might be willing to do their shore in providingfor refugees on a quota basis if the United States,, the British commonwealth and other &quot;western countries would do the some.7.        The Peel Commission took the view that the enterprise of the Jews inagriculture and industry had brought large, if indirect] benefits to theArabs in raising their standard of- living.    Though a very large part of theJewish purchases of land has been made from absentee landlords, many of themliving outside Palestine, it is probable that many Arab farmers who have soldpart of their land to the Jews have been able to make use of the money toimprove the cultivation of their remaining holdings.    The improvement ofhealth conditions in many parts of the country, while due in part to theactivities of Government and. in part to the efforts of the Arabs themselves^has undoubtedly been assisted by the work of the Jewish settlers.    It is alsoargued that the Jewish population ho.s conferred substantial indirect benefits on the Arabs through its contribution to the public revenue.   On the otherhand, the Arabs contend that such improvement as there may have been in theirstandard of living is attributable solely to their own efforts, perhaps witha. measure of aid at some points from the Administration,   They assert that atleast equal improvements have occurred in other Arab countries, and that theaction taken by the Government .to assist Jewish industry and agriculture hasreacted unfavourably on the Arabs.    Import duties for the protection of jewish industries; for example, are said to hate confronted Arab consumerswith the necessity of buying high-priced local products in place of cheaperimported goods.    In any event the Arabs declare that, if they must choose between, freedom and material improvement, they prefer freedom,8. In exasperation at the disregard of their objection to Jewish immi-gration, the Arabs of Palestine have repeatedly risen in revolt.   A substantial number of them still declare their allegiance to the exiled Mufti of Jerusalemand. are satisfied with his policies.    In the second world war, Palestinian Arabwere on.the whole spiritually neutral.   As Jamal Effendi el-Husseini stated inhis evidence before the Committee;      &quot;The Grand Mufti in G-ermany was working fd]the interests not of the English who were warring with the Germans, but for theinterests of his people who had no direct interest, at least, in the controversyThey felt that it was not their war and that the Mufti was right in taking such steps as he could to do the best for Palestine whoever might be victorious./?. The White Paper
CHAPTER VI     -     Page k10.        The White Paper of 1939, and the drastic limitation of Jewish imrni-gration arid of land sales to Jews which followed, met the An ah view only Inport.   The Arabs would have gone much further.    The demands voiced by their leaders are for immediate independence;, for the final cessation of jewish immigration and for the prohibition of all land sales by Arabs -to Jews.10.       So bare an outline give.&quot; only an adequate picture of the passion, withwhich Arabs in Po-lectins and in neighbouring countries resent the invasion ofPalestine by a people which, though originally Semitic, now represents an alien civilisation.    Even the Moslems of India have made representations tothe Committee in opposition to ZionismsOne witnesses in Palestine not merely the impact of European cultureupon the East, but also the impact of Western science and Western technologyupon a semi-feudal civilisation.    It is not surprising that the Arabs havebitterly resented this invasion and have resisted it by force of arms.    TheArab civilisation of Palestine is based on the clan;  leadership resides in asmall group of iivriuent lal f &amp;iflil3.es, and it is almost impossible for the son of an Arab fellah to rise to a position of wealth and political influence.Arab agriculture .in Palestine is traditional, and improvement is hampered byan antiquated system of land tenure-    The Arab adheres to a strict social codefar removed from the customs of the modern vrorld, and he is shocked by innovations-tions of dress smd maia.:erK -v/..iaU seem completely natural to the Jewish irnrni-grant.    Thus, the sight of a Jewish woman: In shorts offends the Arab concept of propriety.    The freedom of relations between the sexes, and the neglect ofgood form as he conceives it violate the entire code of life in which theArab is brought up011     .  The Arabs of Palestine are overwhelmed by a vague sense of the power of-Western capital represented by the Jewish population.   The influx of Westerncapital and the purchase of modern equipment for agriculture and industryexcite in the minds of the Arabs a sense of inferiority and the feeling thatthey ore contending against an imponderable force which is difficult to resist.This feeling is accentuated by the fact that they realise that the Jewish coseis well understood and well portrayed in Washington and London, and that theyhave no means comparable in effectiveness of stating their side of - the      - .controversy to the Western world.    They have particularly resented the reso-resolutions in favour&apos; of Zionist aspirations, adopted respectively by the United/States. Congress
CHAPTER   VI     -     Page 5States Congress and by the British. Labour Party.    Although the Arab States Iftihave diplomatic representation and five of them are members of the united nations, the Arabs of Palestine feel nevertheless that they have not succeeded in making their ease heard.   The Western countries have many Jewish but fewArab citizens,&apos; and Arabs are less familiar with modern methods of propaganda^They feel that their case is being judged and their fate is being decided bymysterious forces in the T/estern world, which they do not understand andwhich do not understand therru12i        The period since the first wOrld war has been marked by a rising waveof nationalism in all Arab countries.   Palestinian Arabs share this sentiment.,and they are strongly supported in their demand for independence and self-government by all the States of the Arab League,   No other sufcject hasoccupied so rnuoh of the attention of the Arab League or has. done so much to unite its membership as nas the question of Palestine.13.        Those members of the Committee who travelled in the neighbouring arab countries found that hostility to Zionism was as strong and widespread there as in Palestine itself.   They received from H.R.H. the Regent of Iraq a copyof a letter in which he had told President Roosevelt that &quot;all the arab countries ..... will unite against any danger that the Arabs 0? Palestine mayhave to meet&quot;.   Moreover the G-overrments .and peoples of the neighbouringStates believe that a Zionist state in Palestine would be a direct threat tothem and would impede their efforts towards a closer Arab union.    The chief   &apos;delegate of Syria at the G-eneral Assembly of the United Nations told theCommittee in London that &quot;Palestine in alien hands would be a wedge splittingthe Arab world at a most vital and sensitive point&quot;.    The same witnessexpressed the further fear of the Arabs that a Zionist State would inevitablybecome expansionist and aggressive, and would tend to enter into alliance with any Power which might, in the future, pursue an anti-Arab policy.&quot;The Middle East,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is a vital region in which all the Great powers are interested,   A Zionist State in Palestine could only exist with thesupport of foreign Powers.   This would not only mean a state of tension between those foreign Powers and the Arab States, but also the grave possi-btlity of dangerous alignments and manoeuvres which might end in internationalfriction at the highest level and possibly disaster.&quot;
CHAPTER     V11CHRISTIAN INTERESTS IN PALESTINE . -1.  &apos;     in addition to the-witnesses concerned.exclusively with political issues, the committee also heard representatives, of Christianchurches.    The Arab Christians, divided&apos; among many denominations&apos;, andnumbering some 1 25,000, form the overwhelming majority of Christiansactually living in Palestine.    Their delegation, led. by the GreekCatholic Archbishop of Galilee, declared their complete solidarity withthe Moslem Arabs in the demand for an independent Arab state.   The non-Palestinian Christian groups were unable to speak with a common voice,indeed, Christians have so completely failed to achieve unity, or evenharmony, in the practical tasks of administering the Christian holy places and caring for the.pilgrims, who visit them that the keys of the holy sepulchre are still entrusted to Moslems.    The lamentable fact thatthere is no single spokesman in Palestine for Christendom tends toobscure the legitimate Christian interest in the Holy Land.; which mustbe safeguarded&quot; in any solution of the national problem.   This interestdemands not only freedom of access to.the Holy places, but also thattranquillity should be achieved in a country all of which, from the christian point of view, is a Holy Land.2o        The significance of Palestine since prehistoric times in the- development of civilisation cannot be overestimated.   Nor should theInterests of archaeology and history be forgotten.    The maintenance of conditions under which such studies can be pursued is a genuine concern of civilisation.    Moreover, an increased pilgrim and tourist trafficy/ould constitute an invisible export of substantial value to a country with so large an adverse balance, of trade; and the contact in Palestinebetween these travellers from the western world and the representativesof tile Jewish and Moslem faiths would be of great importance to inter-national understanding.3. The extent to which the Holy places, sacred to Christians,Moslems and Jews, are interspersed is often not fully appreciated.   It isimpossible to segregate the Holy places sacred to the three great religioninto separate geographical units.   They are scattered over the whole of/Palestine
CHAPTER Vl1-       Pago 2.     .......Palestine, and not, as is. often-.imagined, confined to the Jerusalem andNazareth areas. ,4.        The responsibility of the Christian world toward Palestine waswell expressed by G-eneral AlienDV ln the proclamation which he made onthe occasion of the occupation of Jerusalem on the 11th December, 1917:&quot;Furthermore, since your city is regarded with affectionby the adherents of three of the great religions of mankind,and its soil has been consecrated by the prayers and pil-grimages of multitudes of devout people of these threereligions for many centuries, therefore do I moke known toyou that every sacred building, monument, holy spot, shrine,traditional site, endowment, pious bequest, or customaryplace of prayer of whatsoever form of the three religions,will be maintained and protected according to the existing- customs and beliefs of those to whose faiths they aresacred.&quot;5*        The religious importance of Palestine to Moslems, Jews andChristians alike makes it improper to treat it either as an Arab state or as exclusively designated to the fulfilment of Jewish .nationalaspirations.   A solution of the Palestine problem must not only healpolitical rivalries of Jew and Arab, but must also safeguard its uniquereligious values.
1. The Jews have developed,  under the aegis of the Jewish Agency and theVaad Leurai, a strong and tightly-woven community.       There thus exists a virtual Jewish non-territorial State with its own executive and legislativeorgans,  parallel in many respects to the Mandatory Administration^ and servingas the concrete symbol of the Jewish National Home,        This Jewish shadowGovernment has ceased to co-operate with the Administration in the maintenanceof law and order, and in the suppression of terrorism,2, Quite apart from the increasing strength of the terrorist gangs, whichenjoy widespread popular support., there are many signs that fanaticism andnationalist propaganda are beginning to affect detrimentally the Jewisheducational system.     It appears to us wholly harmful that the obligatoryperiod of one year&apos;s &quot;national service&quot;, instituted &quot;by the Jewish Agency and theVaad Leumi, is how partly used for military training;,      The &quot;closing of the ranks&quot;,moreover, which we noted above,- has increased the totalitarian tendencies towhich a nationalist society is always liable.-     To speak of a Jewish terror wouldbe a gross exaggeration.     But there are disquieting indications that illegalorganisations and the atmosphere of conspiracy, which inevitably accompanies it,are having their corroding effects on that free democracy which has always beenthe pride of the Palestinian Jews.       Every thoughtful Jew with whom we talkedwas profoundly disturbed by these symptoms.      But none was bold enough to prophesythat they would disappear so long as the Palestine Adminstration carried out apolicy which seems to every Jew to be in direct contravention of his natural rightsJewish Relations with Arabs.3. Not only is the Jewish community largely independent of and at odds withthe Palestine Government, but it is also quite distinct from and in conflict withthe Arab community with which, in many areas, it is territorially intertwined.In part this is a natural result of Zionist concentration upon the developmentof the Jewish community.     If the Arabs have benefited, they have done so only in comparison with the non-Palestinian Arabs;   whereas they have remained far beneaththe Palestianian Jews in terms of national income,, social services, education and general standard of living.      This has made it easier for the Arab political/leaders

&quot;leaders to keep alive anti-Jewish feeling in the minds of the Arab masses&quot;.       ab^-&amp;economic gulf separating Jew and Arab in Palestine has been widened, in part atleast, by Jewish policies concerning the non-employment of Arab labour on.landpurchased by the.Jewish National Fund and the refusal to devote Jewish funds andenergies- directly to the improvement of Arab standards of living.     Efforts by theJews in this direction might be quite as important for the growth and security ofthe&apos;National Home as the draining of swamp lands or the creation of Jewish industry.4.        But unfortunately there are signs of a hardening of the Jewish attitudetowards the Arabs.     Too often the Jew is content to refer to the indirdct benefitsaccruing to the Arabs, from his coming, and to leave the matter there.       Passionatelyloving every foot of Eretz Israel, he finds it almost impossible to look at theissue from the Arab point of view, and to realise the depth of feeling aroused byhis &quot;invasion&quot; of Palestine. ..   He compares his own achievements with the slowimprovements made by the Arab village, always to the disadvantage of the latter;and forgets the enormous financial,  educational and technical advantages bestowedupon him by world Zionism. When challenged on bisrelations with the Arabs,  he is too often content to point out the superficialfriendliness of everyday life in town and village - a friendliness which indubitablyexists.     In so doing, he sometimes ignores the deep political antagonism whichinspires the whole Arab community;    or thinks that he has explained it away by stating that it is the &quot;result of self-seeking propaganda by the rich effendi class&quot;.5. It is.not unfair to say that the Jewish community in Palestine has never,-as a community, faced the problem of co-operation with the Arabs.     It is, for -instance, significant that, in the Jewish Agency&apos;s proposal for a Jewish State, theproblem of handling a million and a quarter   Arabs is dealt With in the vaguest Dfgeneralities.6.        We noted, however, a few hopeful signs.     Reference&apos;was made above to theproposals for co-operation with the Arabs made by Hashomer Hatzair and by the Ihudgroup.-    The Committee observed with pleasure the Arab-Jewish co-operation achievedon the Municipal Commission which governs Haifa,  and in the Citrus Control and marketing Boards, as well as the joint trade union activity between Jew&apos; and Arabin the Palestine Potash Company and on the railways.&apos;    But such examples of co-operation are rare in- Palestine;    and they are far outweighed in Arab eyes by theexclusiveness of the General Federation of Jewish Labour in. its trade union policyand of the Jewish Agency in -its labour policy on land purchased for Jewish settlement.The Jews and
GHAFTJ5R VTII -   PAGE 3Tbe Jro and the Administration.7. Y,re were profoundly impressed by the very varied experiments in land settlement which we inspected, .ranging from individualist co-operatives to pure collectivistcommunities.    Here,  indeed,  is a miracle both of physical achievement and of spiritsendeavour, which justifies the dreams of those Jews and Gentiles who first conceivetbeidea of the National Home.      Of Jewish industry in Palestine it is too early yet to speak with confidence.    There is boundless- optimism and energy, great administratcapacity, but a shortage of skilled labour and,  as a result, more quantity than .quality of output.&apos; 8. As pioneers in Palestine the Jews have a record of which they can be proud.In Palestine there has been, no expulsion of the indigenous population, and exploitatiof cheap Arab labour has been vigorously opposed as inconsistent with Zionism.      Thefailing of Palestinian Jewry is a different one.    &apos; The Jews have always been in thebiblical phrase a &quot;peculiar people&quot; which turned in on itself and suffered the  conss-quences of its peculiarity.      In Palestine,   under the special conditions of&quot;theMandate, they have regained their national self-confidence, but they have not been abto throw off their exclusiveness and tendency to self-isolation.9.       Y/e believe that this&apos; failure is,  in part at least, attributable to the relatiebetween the Palestine Administration and the Jewish community since 1939, which bav3undoubtedly exaggerated the natural   Jewish tendency to exclusivoness.      Moreover,the Jews feel that they have enough to do defending their own position, without taking on the Arab problem as well.10. 1 second factor of great importance Is the failure to develop self-governing institutions. Tbe Jews, like the Arabs, are completely deprived of all responsibleparticipation in central government.&apos; Their democracy can only work within theJewish community, and to a limited degree in local affairs. Thus, they have not hfjthe opportunity which self-government brings, to learn the lesson of responsibilityfor the good of the whole State. They have been driven back on themselves. this may in part explain the fact that at least one-third of the Jews who have settled IPalestine during the last ten years have failed to apply for Palestinian citisensbiBut nothing which we saw in Palestine gave Us any reason to believe that,  chargedwith the democratic responsibilities for which they are undoubtedly fit,  the Jews. . &apos;  &apos; &apos; &apos;of Palestine would not master the lessons of self-government.Arab Leadershi
CHAPTER VIII__PAGE it-Arab Loadership. &quot; 1B 911. The Arabs are divided politically by the personal bickerings of the leaders,which still centre round -the differences of the Husseinis and their rivals;    andsocially by the gap which separates.the small upper class from the mass of the peasants -a gap which the new intelligentsia is not yet strong enough to bridge..    Consequentlyibey have developed no such internal democracy as have the Jews.    That their divisionshave not been overcome and a formally organised community developed is in part theI result of a less acutely self-conscious nationalism than is found to-day among the Jews.It is,   however, also the outcome of a failure of political responsibility.      The Arableaders, rejecting what they regard as a subordinate status in the Palestinian State,and viewing themselves as the proper heirs of the Mandatory Administration,  have refused to develop a self-governing Arab community parallel to that of the Jews.     Nor,so far,  have they been - prepared to sec their position called in question by suchderaocractic forms as elections for the Arab Higher&apos; Committee,  or the formation ofIpopularly based political parties.     This failure is recognised by ,the new intelli-I gentsia which, however,  is unlikely to exercise much power until it has the backingI of a larger middle class. &quot;&apos;&quot;I Need for Arab^Educatipn.112, ,:;   Many Arabs are graduates of the American University at Beirut;    a few have i studied in universities in Cairo, England, Europe and the United States;    others have i;j received higher education at the Arab College for men and the Women&apos;s Training Collegelin Jerusalem, both of which are efficient-,but inadequately financed government institutions..    The Arabs are &quot;aware of Western civilisation and increasingly eager to share its benefits.     But the numbers receiving such education ore still&apos; miserably-small,since the only university in Palestine,  the Hebrew University on Mount Scopus, teachesonly in Hebrew.      So too with secondary education..    There are only some fifteen Arab- .secondary schools in the whole of Palestine, and one fully developed agriculturalschool - the Kadoorie School at Tulkarm which specialises in the training- of teachersof agriculture for Arab schools.     With only 65 places,  however, it too is totally..-,inadequate.      The problem of teaching modern methods of agriculture to a populationper cent,  of which gains its living by farming has not yet been solved by theGovernment,  or faced by the Arab politicians.       Facilities for technical-educationre no better - a single school with some.&apos; 60 places.fi        . On.the primary level the position is slightly better.     The schools are underthe control of the Administration and financed by public funds.     As far-as it goes,tho primary education is well planned and administered.     It is not merely a bookish   *ill
CHAPTER VTII   -   PAGE education, but includes also manual-training and.-instruction in agriculture, wherethe equipment is available. .   Some of the school gardens which surround the schools in the Arab villages are models of neatness and skill,     -.But the fact remains that something less than half the Arab children who would like to attend school can do soto-day..      Even, in a wealthy town like.Haifa, we were told by the Municipal Commission^that half the Arab boys and. the, majority, of the- Arab girls receive no education at all,In most of the country districts the.situation is- still worse, particularly withregard to the girls.     Only, one Arab girl in eight receives any education.Hi-,     This is all the more tragic since the desire for education is now strong through-out the poorer classes, not merely in the cities, but in almost every Arab village.Indeed,  some villages visited by the Committee had either built their own schoolscompletely from voluntary subscriptions by the villagers or had contributed largely totheir cost on their own initiative. -... -   -.   -15.     The lamentable condition of Arab. .education is a real cause for discontent.      Thisdiscontent is increased by the contrast with the opportunities. of interfered to the Jewishchild.     Jewish education in Palestine is financed by the Jewish community and -by the fees which Jewish parents can afford to pay.      Practically every- Jewish child&apos; has theopportunity for primary education,  and those who can afford the fees have ample opportunity for technical, secondary and university education in Palestine.     TheGovernment contributes only a small per capita grant in aid and exercises littlecontrol of the : curriculum..------16.    &apos;     It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the time has&apos; come for-the Arabcommunity to: assume the same responsibility with regard to education as the Jewish;Withadvice and financial aid from the Government, and with a new sense of respohsi-bility on the part of. the Arab leadership,  compulsory education could, we were informedbe introdued within the next ten years.  &apos;  This is not only essential from an educationalpoint of view;- there can be no real unity bet-ween a literate and an illiteratepopulation. - -- -The Administration; \-&apos; &apos;17. Palestine is administered by officials &apos;of the British Colonial Service.      Subjeto the provisions of the Mandate, all &quot;major decisions&apos;of policy are taken in london as they would be for a Colonial territory.&apos;        As&apos; &quot;Mr. Churchill has said:&apos;    &quot;the-suggestion that the High Commissioner either has a policy of his own in cohtra-distiriljto that of His Majesty&apos;s-Government,  or that, If this were so, His Majesty-&apos;s&quot;Government would, permit him ic- &quot;carry it out, would &quot;be foreign to all the traditions oBritish Administration&quot;.      Indeed,  the Administration of Palestine has probably less/freedom
of-    ISCW CHAPTER VIII - PAGE 6freedom of action than the Administrations of some less developed territories,  simply because the affairs of Palestine arouse more/public Interest,  are the subject of morequestions in the House, of Commons, and must therefore be supervised more.closely by the responsible Minister.l8,.        While admitting this difficulty, we must express the view that this systemmilitates most gravely against the chances of reconciliation between-Jew and Arab.,     Adelicate situation - and the situation in Palestine is always delicate - cannot be metsuccessfully by remote control.      Within a general directive,  the&apos; man on the spot,like the general conducting the-battle, must be given the responsibility.,     If &apos; this isnot done,   the chance of reconciling the interests&apos; of&apos;-the National Home with those ofthe Arabs of Palestine is small indeed.19. In Palestine itself, we also found a tendency to centralisation which waseriticised by the Peel Commission but which is in part at least another inevitableconsequence of the dominant role of politics in the life of the country.      Since everyadministrative question,  however insignificant in itself, is liable to be transformedI into a political issue by one community or the other,  there Is a natural tendency for1 every action to be carefully scrutinised at the centre.     The slowness of the Adrainistra-I tion in dealing with matters not at first sight political,  against which complaint is often made,, is partly a result of this nnd partly of the fact that the Chief Secretary,through whose hands all important business must pass,  is himself obliged to give muchof his time to conducting relations of a quasi-diplomatic character with the leaders ofHthe Arab and Jewish communities.20..        Palestine is a -unique country, bearing no resemblance to most of the countries(administered by the British Colonial Service.      It may be questioned therefore whether an,Administration of the Colonial type is the ideal instrument for governing two peoplesleach of which,  in the absence of the other, would probably by now be enjoying completeI independence.      On the other hand, it seems difficult to foresee radical changes in thesystem so long as the division between Arabs and Jews compels British officials toiassume so extensive a responsibility,, and in view of the fact that their actions must be6iaccounted for both to Parliament and to an international organisation,  each responsivel^o a keenly interested public opinion.What is not open to question is the patience and loyalty to their task of thejPfficials on whose shoulders rests the main burden of this heavy responsibility.    WeIprere impressed also by the generally high standard of the district administration./it is
CHAPTER VIII.....-   PAGE 7   vIt is difficult for those who have not visited Palestine to imagine the tensionunder which these officials - Arab and Jewish, as well as British - are compelledto live and work.     We were especially impressed by the anxiety, loneliness andnervous.strain to which many police officials are unavoidably exposed.      It alsoseemed to us that the Civil Servants in Palestine were subjected to anadditional anxiety which we could not regard as unavoidable or in the best interests of the country, as a result of the generally and sometimes pitifullyinadequate salaries which they at present receive.
CHAPTER   IXPUBLIC   SECURITY1911,        Palestine is an armed oampc   We Sow/ signs of this almost as soon as wecrossed the frontier, and we &quot;became more and more, aware of the tense atmosphere3i3p.h day.    Many &quot;buildings have barbed wire and other defences.   We ourselves werehiosely guarded by armed police,  and often escorted by armoured cars.    It isobvious that very considerable military forces and large numbers of police are kept in Palestine,,    The police are armed;    they are conspicuous everywhere;    and through--at the country there are substantially built police barracks,20        We do not think that the conditions in Palestine since the Mandate have beenfully appreciated throughout the world, and accordingly we have thought it right toset out in Appendix V a list of the main incidents of disorder.    It will be seen that up to the year 1939 the Jews exercised very great restraint.    It is in recent yearsthat the threat to law and order has come from them,3o        A revival of the illegal immigration traffic has occurred since the end ofthe war in Europe,    During the summer of 1945 there was an influx on a substantial scale by land over the northern frontier.    More recently there have been successiveopses of entry by sea,    The Jewish organisations are actively engaged in thesejoperations. carried, out latterly, by the purchase or charter of ships for voyagesfrom southern Europe in the absence of effective control of embarkation,    Armedplashes are liable to arise from the efforts to prevent interference;    a numberhave arisen from the search for illegal immigrants and arms.    Moreover, as recentIjincidents directly concerned -with illegal immigration, may be cited the sabotageof patrol launches, and attacks on coastguard stations.The present scale and method of illegal immigration by sea can be seen from three recent cases.    Two ships arrived towards the end of our stay in Palestine,md one a few weeks previously.    All three were intercepted and, in accordance withjthe usual procedure.,  the illegal immigrants taken to a clearance camp where, subjectjto check,  they were released,  their numbers being deducted from the immigration quota,L  &apos;pie first of these ships sailed from northern Italy.    It &quot;Was her maiden voyage.She carried 911 immigrants, 554 men and 347 women.    Practically all were young people,phe second carried 247 immigrants, of whom 89 -were -women.   With one exception, allrSfe young people..    The third, which arrived on the day of our departure from^lestine, was reported in the press ns caning from a French Mediterranean portcarrying 733 immigrants, /The,,.,

&apos; : &apos; OHPATBR IX Page   3 r ,- The&apos;second ship, according to press reports, Was expected to land the immigrants at Tel-Aviv,  and the plans for screening the immigrants were evident inthe sporadic&quot;incidents which occurred in that area.    Apart from firing on the police,.jfc.ere;were incidents of mining and blocking of access by road and rail which could,    -only be designed to isolate the approach to the beach;4,        A sinister   aspect of recent years is the &apos;development of large illegal armed forces.    The following is the &apos;structure as stated to us by the military authorities.The general organisation &quot;is the &quot;Haganah&quot;.    It is an illegal development ofthe former organisation, in the days of Turkish rule, of armed &quot;Watchmen Who protectedJewish settlements.    Today it is completely organised, under a: central control andwith subsidiary territorial commands, in three branches, -each of which includeswomen, viz:-&apos;   &quot;&quot; &apos; , .A static force composed of settlers and townsfolk^ -with an:&apos;eBtiiaated strengthof 40,000; &apos; .: A field&apos;army, based on the Jewish Settlement Police and trained in more,-,mobile operations,&apos; with an estimated strength of 16,000; .A full-time force (Palmach), permanently mobilised and provided with- -transport,with an estimated peace establishment of 2,000 and war establishment of some 6,000.It is known that the Haganah has been proeuring arms over a period .of-years.Vast quantities have been obtained from the residue of the campaigns in. the KiddleEast,    Arms and ammunition are kept and concealed in specially constructed caches insettlements ahd&quot;towns*   The following are particulars, furnished to us by the     ,military authorities, of a search -which Was conducted at Biriya Settlement about,the time of our&apos;arrival in Palestine.During &quot;&apos;&quot;the night of 27th/28th February, 1946,  shots were fired at a. sentryof the Arab Legion &quot;at his post distant,some mile or mile and a half from. Biriya. ......-Although&apos;wounded in the thigh, he returned the fire.   Ne^t morning blood stains and ,bandages were found and &quot;police dogs carried a line direct from there to,Biriya.Biriya is situated in a commanding position on the hills of Northern. Galilee. ,lit can only be described as a fort. , .   .....The &quot;population of Biriya were detained.    They consisted of 25 men,..

They contained,; among other equipment, one Sten gun,-one Bren, four modern rifles,: one -wireless set andgrenades, - - &apos; . .Numerous documents -were also discovered in the caches.   Their substanceconnected the. caches with Biriya, and a police dog taking scent from the documentsidentified one of the men in the building at Biriya.   The documents included standing orders for the camp, notes on the structure and duties of the Haganah,  training,manuals, notes on neighbouring military and police canps*5,     Something in the nature of conscription is in forcej as is shown by two pressnotices of the 6th November, 1.945:-Palestine Post..: .&quot;A year&apos;s national service in communal settlements will htiw.berequired from all.

0  &apos; CHAPTER   IX Page__2^6.        Apart from the Haganah,  two further illegal armed organisations exist, bothhaving cut away from the parent body.-    One ls&quot;t&quot;he&quot;irgun  vai Leumi&quot;, which was formed in 1935 by dissident members of. the Hag an ah.   The-other is the : &quot;Stern Group&quot;j^hioh broke away from the Irgun early in - the war when the latter announced, an&quot;armistice&quot;.   The &quot;Irgun Operates under its own. secret-command.mainly in sabotage andterrorism against the Mandatory;    its strength-..is estimated at. from 3,000. to 5,000*The Stern Group engages in terrorism;&apos;   its strength is said, to be. between 200 and 300.7,       It seams clear that the activities of all these bodies could be greatly reduced if there was any&apos;&apos;go-operatiori-&quot;with the--authorities by the Jewish agency and its officers, and by the rest of the population..   Unfortunately the Jewish Agencyceased to co-operate -with the Government, &apos; or atleast reduced; the measure of their co-operation as from the end of&quot; thewar. .We set out in the form of an extract from the Palestine Post   of the 30thDecember, 1945,  the attitude&quot;&apos; of the &quot;Chairman of the Executive, of the Jewish Agencytfter the murders of the 27th December,-1945.    In the course of his evidence &quot;beforeus Mr.  Ben Gurion said that lie tobk responsibility for giving this statement tothe press J 1&apos;       .   , : -&quot;Following upon the outrages -which occurred, on Thursday night,. HisExcellency the High Commissioner summoned Mr. D, Ben Gurion .and. Mr... Mi- Shertokto see him at Government -House; on Friday &quot;morning, it &quot;Was officially statedyesterday, &quot; &apos; &apos; 1   .It is learned that during the interview, Mr. Een Gurion and. Mr, Shertokdeclared that the Jewish Agency completely dissociated,themselves from themurderous attacks on Government, and army establishments perpetrated on Thursday&apos;night.   They expressed their profound sorrow at the loss of life caused bythe attacks.But,  they stated,  any efforts by the Jewish Agency to assist in preventingsuch acts would be rendered futile by the policy pursued in Palestine by HisMajesty&quot; s Government on which the primary responsibility rests for the tragicsituation created in the country, and -which had led in recent weeks to blood-shed and innocent victims among Jews,  Britons and others.? The Jewish Agency representatives added that it &quot;Was difficult to appealto the Tishuv to observe the law at a time when the Mandatory Government itself was consistently violating the fundamental law of the country&apos; embodied inthe Palestine Mandate.&quot; ySo long,...,,
&apos;      : &apos;- CHAPTER. . LX . Page   5Bo.long as this kind of view is put forward by&apos; the leaders Of the Jewish Agencyit is impossible to look for settled conditions.- - -&quot;&apos;-&apos;-. All three organisations to which reference&apos;has&apos; been made are illegal.&apos;-We recognise that until comparatively recently, efforts were made by the jewish agency to curb attacks;    we regret that these efforts appear to have ceased,.  Webelieve that those responsible for the working of the Jewish Agency - a body ofgreat power and influence over the Jews in Palestine - could do a great deal towardsloutting an end to outrages such as we have described, v/hioh place the people ofPalestine as well as British soldiers and police in constant danger.Private armies ought not to exist;    they constitute a danger to the peace - of -the worldT &quot; - 18,-        The position of Great Britain as Mandatory is not a happy one.;   The Chairmanof the Executive of the Jewish Agency said that, in the event of the withdrawalf -of the British troops, the Jews -Would take care of themselves.- Jamal EffendiHusseini, replying to a question,  said that it was the wish of the Arabs ofPalestine that British foroes and police should be withdrawn forthwith.    Aunl EeyAbdul Hadi,-. also representing, the Arab Higher Committee, expressed his agreement,Jamal Effendi Husseini stated that&apos;he did hot expect bloodshed but that, on thewithdrawal of British f orces, there would be a return to the condition Which precededthe first world war (i, e. pre-Balfour Declaration).   We are clear in our raiids&apos;.that if, British forces were withdrawn there-would be immediate and prolongedbloodshed the end of which it is impossible to predict.
idCHAPTER       X. &quot;, - .. ....   :     -      184bbv      ..... - GENERAL.   ;;.&quot;V.In view of the dissolution&apos;of the League of Nations and of the statement of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House of Commons on&quot; the .13th November,.hh5, we assume that the British Government will in the near future, prepare a draftwtrusteeship Agreement for eventual submission to the United Nations, and that thisAgreement will include the terms under which Palestine will be administered.     We do not propose to refer to the existing Mandate in detail;    it is set- out in Appendix VI.,2.        Our views on future immigration policy are contained in Recommendation No. 6Ind in the Comments thereunder, and we have nothing to add to them,3.       With regard to the &quot;future-government of Palestine, we have - reviewed the question- -   - .       ....pi&quot; a solution by partition.The Peel Commission stated (Chapter XX, paragraph 19):    &quot;Manifestly the problemcannot be sdved by giving either the Arabs or the Jews all they want.      The-answer  -.-:fo the question 1 which of them in the end will&apos; govern Palestine?&apos; must-surely be. - &apos;:.Neither&apos;&quot;,      That is the view which we also have formed.      They recommended the-   1.Jermination of the Mandate,  the partition of the country between the Arabs and the .f^us (excepting the Holy Places) and the setting up of two independent States in treaty-gelations -with Great Britain.     These recommendations were rejected by the Arabs andfthey did not meet with the complete approval of the Jews.      They were adopted In theIfirst instance by the Government of Great Britain, but subsequently a technicalH)ramiss.ion- was sent to Palestine to ascertain facts and to consider in detail the ...$Tactical possibilities of a scheme of partition.    &apos; As a result of the PartitionIbTflmission&apos; s Report, His Majesty&apos;s Government announced their conclusions that-thefemination by the Commission had shown that the political, administrative and financialffl-fficulties involved in the proposal to create independent Arab and Jewish States.! .        &quot; - - - -    - - -   -inside Palestine were so great that the solution of the problem was impracticable.Sie proposal accordingly fell to the ground, and His Majesty&apos;s Government continued their responsibility for the government of the whole of Palestine.We have considered the matter anew and we have heard the views of varioustnesses of great experience.     Partition has an appeal at first sight as giving a*ospect of early independence and self-government to Jews and Arabs, but in our view^partition would have any&apos; chance unless it was basically acceptable to Jews and Arabs,Id there is no sign of that to-day.     We are accordingly unable to recommend partitionI the solution. A.     Palestine
CHAPTER X_______1+. Palestine is a country unlike any other.     It is not merely a place in whichArabs and Jews live.       Millions of people throughout the world take a fervent intersin Palestine and in its Holy Places and are deeply grieved by the thought that it has been the seat of trouble for so long and by the fear that it may well become thecockpit of another war.     Lord Milner in 1923, having declared himself a strongsupporter of pro-Arab policy, said:- ^)&quot;Palestine can never be regarded as a country on the same footing as the other Arab countries.       You cannot ignore all history andtradition in the matter.     , You cannot ignore the fact that this.isthe cradle of two of the great religions of the world. .It is a sacred land to the Arabs, but it is also a sacred land to the-   Jew and the Christian;    and the future of Palestine cannot possibly beleft to be determined by the temporary&quot; impress!tins and feelings of theArab majority in the country of the present day.&quot;The Peel Commission having cited., these words wrote (Chapter II, paragraph 51&apos;)!&quot;The case stated by Lord Milner against an Arab control of Palestine applies equally to a Jewish control&quot;.     That expresses our view absolutely.Efforts have been made from time to time to encourage both Arabs and Jews totake part in the Government of the country but these efforts have failed throughmutual antagonism;    perhaps they might have been pursued further.       It is not thecase of a backward people going through a period of tutelage;    the issue lies betweenJews and Arabs. .   .We believe this can only be met by acceptance of the principle that there shallbe no domination of the one by the other, that Palestine shall be neither an Arab nora Jewish State.       The setting up of self-governing institutions is dependent on the will-to work together on the part of Jews and Arabs,      There has been little sign ofthat in recent years and yet we hope a change may take place if and when the fear ofdominance is removed.       We do not think that any good purpose would be served by purgoing into further detail;    once the will to work together appears, representatives ofboth sides will be of help in framing a constitution;    until that happens no step canbe taken.Meantime Palestine must remain under some form of Mandate or Trusteeship. &apos;   Wehave suggested elsewhere in our Report that much can be done to encourage generaladvancement by the improvement of educational facilities and measures directed tonarrowing the social and economic disparities.      We feel,  too,  that it should be       ^possible to draw the communities closer together, and foster a popular interest in self-government at the local level.     Especially in the country districts, a spirit/of good
of good neighbourliness exists among the common people, Arabs and Jews,despite the general state of   political tensibiiin the country.     Practicalco-operation is evident in day-to-day aff airs. .: - . We suggest that localadministratee areas might be formed,  some purely Arab or Jewish in composition,but some of mixed population where a corporate sense of civic responsibilitycan be encouraged and a. new beginning made, in the development of self-government.5.      ..Land questions have been the cause of much friction and dispute betweenJews and Arabs,     We are opposed to legislation and practices which discriminate against either,  and-for the reasons already given v/e recommend the rescissionand replacement of the Land Transfers Regulations of 1940 and the prohibitionof restrictions limiting employment on certain.lands to members of one race,community or creed. &apos;-;  &apos;&apos;-. We are .aware of the criticisms of the existing-Land Ordinances and we donot. wish it to be-thought, that. we. consider that they afford adequate protection to the Arab small-owners and tenants. In our opinion it should be possible to devise Ordinances furnishing proper protection to such Arabs no matter in whatpart of Palestine they may reside.6. We have already stated that the 100,000 certificates for Palestine,  theimmediate authorisation of which we recommend, will provide for only a comparatively small proportion of the total number of Jewish refugees in Europe.     The general problem of refugees must, we feel, be dealt with by the United Nations,      In ourconsidered opinion it is a matter for regret that this distressing problem hasnot been dealt with before this time.       True the great Powers have had many problems facing them and they have dealt with many displaced persons, but thefact remains that Jews and others have remained in camps or centres for very many months, *We observe that at a recent meeting of the General Assembly of the united nations the problem of displaced persons and refugees of all categories was recognised to be one of immediate urgency, and it was referred to the Economicand Social Council which has since established a special Committee for its consider-ation.       Without presuming to advise that Committee, and with no desire to go beyond our Terms of Reference, we cannot but observe that international bodiesalready established for dealing with refugee problems have been unable,  throughinsufficiency of financial resources or other reasons, to fulfil the hopes placedin them at the time of their formation.     The world looks forward, we believe, to ,/the birth
CHaPTisR X_-.......PflffiS 4the birth of a truly effective agency of international collaboration in the humanitarian task of migration and. resettlement.we make grateful acknowledgment of our deep indebtedness to thecivil and military officers of our Wo Governments.     They have given uswilling and able assistance throughout our long journeyings and made it possible for us to complete the report within the period allotted.Our staff listed in Appendix VII has worked admirably and efficientlyunder pressure and often in difficult circumstances.Finally we desire to tender our sincere thanks to our efficientSecretaries, H.G. Vincent,    L.L. Rood,    H. Beeley, E.M. Wilson.
