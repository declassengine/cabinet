THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1946.SECRET. Copy No.   3CP. (46) 189.7th May, 1946.CABINET.COMMERCIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.IN the statement which he made in the House of Commons on the6th December on the Financial Agreement (Cmd. 6708) with the United Statesand on the Proposals for Consideration by an International Conference on Tradeand Employment (Cmd. 6709) the Prime Minister, referring to the latter, saidthat the United States and the United Kingdom intended, well in advance of theInternational Conference, to carry on between themselves and other countries,including, of course, British Commonwealth countries, preliminary negotiationsupon the subjects dealt with in the American document in order to prepare theway for, and contribute to the success of, the International Conference when itmet. For various reasons the date for these preliminary negotiations has been several times postponed. The present paper examines the latest suggestions aboutdates received from the United States Government. I attach as Annex A a noteshowing developments since November last and in particular dealing with a new factor in the situation, the Preparatory Committee which the Economic and social Council has set up to prepare for the full international conference:2. American proposals. Briefly the tentative proposals how made by the americans are that (A) during the period the 1st July-the 15th August there should be held in new York a meeting of the Preparatory Committee &quot;to beginconsideration of the work assigned to the Committee &quot; by the Counciland to discuss the American proposals in Cmd. 6709 on a generalexploratory basis without necessarily aiming at definite agreement and without, of course, any detailed tariff bargaining.(B) During the period the 15th August-the 15th October a drafting sub-committee appointed for the purpose by the Preparatory Committeeshould draw up a detailed charter for the International trade organisation on the basis of discussions and drafts submitted by themembers of the Preparatory Committee.(C) A second meeting of the Preparatory Committee should be held inMarch 1947 to consider the draft charter. . This meeting wouldcoincide with the meeting of &quot;drafting&quot; countries.On these proposals the State Department are anxious to have our considered views as soon as possible.3.   For the reasons indicated below I think we should ;(a) agree to a meeting of the-.Preparatory Committee as proposed; but(b) propose that it should be in October and not July, and m Europe notthe United States; and(c) say that we see no merit in the proposed sub-committee.4.   What follows is an attempt to balance the disadvantages of the new programme as proposed by the Americans against certain arguments in its favour.[31786] &apos; ^ ^ b
5. Disadvantages.&apos;(a) I have serious misgivings about a form of procedure under which negotiations on the proposed rules of conduct for members of theInternational Trade Organisation should be divorced from detailedtariff bargaining. Throughout the long discussions which precededthe publication of Cmd. 6709 it had always been contemplated, bothby the American negotiators and our own, that negotiations on the charter of the International Trade Organisation and the rales of conduct which its members would adopt should be carried on simul-taneously with the detailed tariff bargaining, without the inducementof which definite progress is, in our view, not to be expected. It is acardinal element in our policy to secure the abandonment by othercountries of import restrictions except for the protection of payments.We have suffered much in the past from the action of certain countrieswhich have protected domestic industries by means of import restrictions. I doubt whether they could be persuaded to abandon theuse of such restrictions for this purpose unless they could see the positive advantages, e.g., from substantial reductions in the UnitedStates tariff, which they might obtain in return. I attach as Annex Ba note expanding this point somewhat.(&amp;) I also have strong objection to that feature of the American plan whichwould provide for the establishment of a drafting sub-committee ofthe Preparatory Committee. It would be one thing to hold a meetingof the Preparatory Committee for the purpose of a general exchange of views on the proposals in Cmd. 6709, of seeking clarification and ofexpounding the advantages of the proposals as we and the Americanssee them; it would be quite another thing to attempt to elaborate theAmerican proposals into a draft charter or convention since therepresentatives of the Governments on the drafting sub-committee could scarcely avoid making repeated reservations unless they were constantly referring back to their Governments or incurring come degree of commitment which their Governments might be unwilling to undertake.(c) Moreover, negotiations on the scale necessary to produce a draft or draftsreflecting the views of Governments could not be effectively undertaken without a team of ten or twelve representing the Departmentsprimarily concerned. They would necessarily be key men who could probably ill be spared for such a long period as the Americans contem-plate. This objection would no doubt apply perhaps with even greater force in the case of some of the Dominions and some of theEuropean countries.(d) Another strong objection to the American scheme is that if, as seems likely, Congressional approval of the loan is not assured before July,we should already be publicly committed to a step which would rightlybe represented as taking us along a path of commercial policy whichwe undertook to pursue on the basis that it should receive the financialassistance which the loan is designed to provide.(e) Finally, it would be necessary, before embarking on the discussionscontemplated by the Americans, to have preliminary talks with repre-sentatives of Commonwealth and Empire countries. To fit in with theAmerican time-table, these would have to be held early in June. Thus,if we assented to the American proposition we should be faced withsomething very like the following programme : lst-30th June. Preliminary Commonwealth and Empiretalks on matters other than detailed tariff bargaining, presumablyin London.1st July-15th August. Meeting of Preparatory Committee in new York.15th August-15th October. Meeting of drafting sub-committee of Preparatory Committee in New York.1st February. Renewed Commonwealth and Empire talks ondetailed tariff bargaining.15th March. Meeting of t; drafting &quot; countries synchronisedwith second meeting of Preparatory Committee.
6. Arguments against flatly rejecting the American programme.(a) If there is no meeting until March 1947 of the drafting countries, interestmay tend to evaporate. The Economic and Social Council has in anycase set up the Preparatory Committee, and the Chairman (Sir R.Mudaliar), speaking, it is true, at a time when the meeting of draftingcountries was expected to be held in. September, referred in theEconomic and Social Council to a meeting of the preparatory committee in July. There is therefore at least a possibility that thePreparatory Committee will feel impelled to get on with its job eventhough the meeting of drafting countries which we had always hopedwould guide its work has been postponed until 1947.(b) Alternatively, if no meeting of the Preparatory Committee is arranged,.the Economic and Social Council might itself intervene and disturbthe careful balance of the proposals in Cmd. 6709, achieved with somuch labour last autumn. Not only are several important tradingnations, including Australia and New Zealand, not at present membersof the Council (whereas they are on the Preparatory Committee);there would be the further danger that the subject would not be handled by those who have been through the previous discussions and,both for that reason and because of their responsibility for economicand commercial questions generally, are in the lead in handling the difficult issues raised in Cmd. 6709.(c) There is much to be said for a thorough exposition of the advantages ofthe American proposals to some of the drafting countries which are less familiar with them than the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates. Moreover, the ventilation of differences at a meeting of thePreparatory Committee, which would not be expected to enter into anybinding commitments, would provide the Governments concerned withan opportunity of considering other points of view than those which. they were initially disposed to adopt themselves.(d) Finally, such a meeting of the Preparatory Committee would at leastshow in advance of the meeting of drafting countries which of theAmerican proposals in Cmd. 6709 are generally acceptable and might serve to define the issues where differences of opinions existed.7. Suggested reply to Americans. We must clearly reply as soon as wereasonably can to the Americans&apos; request for our views on the new programme.I think the reply should be on the following lines : &apos;.: (A) We fully appreciate the circumstances in which the United StatesGovernment have proposed this new programme and accept thenecessity to postpone the detailed discussions on tariffs until March1947. We share their desire to keep interest alive and make some progress in the meantime. But having undertaken to use our best endeavours to bring the discussions to a successful conclusion we feel bound to say that in our view the new programme in its entiretywould not serve to further this object.(B) We see considerable advantage in a meeting of the preparatory committee (lasting preferably not more than four and certainly notmore than six weeks) for the purpose of (i) exchanging views andremoving any doubts about the intentions of the American proposals,(ii) of expounding the considerations which led up to the joint statement by the United States and the United Kingdom which was issued on their publication on the 6th December, and (iii) of enlistingsupport of the principle of a worldwide reduction of trade barriers.i (C) On the other hand we see no merit in the proposed drafting sub-committee. We do not see how such a sub-committee could do any useful work. Either there would be constant reservations which wouldthwart hopes of positive progress or some degree of commitment wouldbe involved for which Governments would not be ready until commit-ments on actual tariff reductions were also under negotiation, thatis to say until the &quot;drafting&quot; countries meet in March. Indeed,if for such reasons Governments were led to take firm positions on points of difficulty we feel that the establishment of a drafting sub-. committee might positively impede the successful outcome of the laterconference,[31786] b 2
(D) Moreover, we consider that July is too soon for the meeting of thePreparatory Committee. We understand that final Congressionalaction on the Financial Agreement may not be taken until the middleof July. Owing to the close connexion between the published proposals on Commercial Policy and the financial position we, for our part,could not attend a meeting of the Preparatory Committee appointedby the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations untilCongress has acted, and we consider that six weeks notice should begiven in order that members of the Preparatory Committee mayhave time to make the necessary arrangements to attend. This wouldalso give us time before the Preparatory Committee assemble tohold the preliminary discussions with Empire Governments to whichwe are committed.(E) Our view is therefore that, provided Congress has acted in time, the aim should be to hold a meeting of the Preparatory Committee earlyin the autumn. We should have been inclined to suggest Septemberbut as meetings in the United States of the General Assembly ofthe United Nations and of the Economic and Social Council havealready been arranged for the 1st September, the 1st October appearsto us to be the earliest practicable date.(F) We consider it extremely desirable, for reasons which we feel sureare appreciated by the United States Government, that the proposed meeting should be held in Europe (preferably in London or Geneva).(G) Meanwhile we welcome their proposal that we and they should continueto have informal exchanges of views with other countries such a shave already served to remove misunderstandings and to promote the ideas which both countries share.8. If my colleagues agree with the proposal in the preceding paragraph  think it essential that we should speedily consult the Dominions and Indiabefore actually replying to the Americans. A preliminary -meeting of -Common-wealth of Empire Governments will still be necessary before any part of theinternational discussions takes place. It will obviously be out of place to discussdetailed tariff questions so long before the meeting of drafting countries but,as agreement has already been reached and arrangements are in train to have such a preliminary meeting in July, and since both August and September wouldbe most inconvenient for Australia and New Zealand because of forthcomingelections, I suggest we let that arrangement stand but confine the business, inthe main to the general questions.. H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S. W. 1.7th May, 1946.ANNEX A.History of Developments since November 1945.1. For convenience this note refers to the International Conference whichis proposed in Cmd. 6709 as &quot; The Full International Conference &quot; and to thepreliminary negotiations referred to by the Prime Minister as &quot;the meeting of drafting countries.&quot;2. In pursuance of the understanding reached in the course of thediscussions leading up to the agreements published in Cmd. 6708 and 6709, theUnited States Government invited us last December to appoint representatives-to attend the meeting of drafting countries in March or April of this year &apos;&apos; ata place to be determined.&quot; Similar invitations were issued to thirteen othercountries.* In accepting this invitation we expressed some doubt whether the preparations necessary to ensure success could be completed in time for themeeting to be held in March or April.3. The American invitation referred to the proposal of the Governmentof the United States that the United Nations Organisation should convene the* Australia, Belgium/Luxembourg, Brazil, Canada, China, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, France,India, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, U.S.S.R. All of them have accepted except theU.S.S.R. which is still considering the invitation.
full international conference. This proposal was considered by the Economicand Social Council who, on the 5th March, adopted a resolution deciding tocall the full international conference in the latter part of 1946, constituting a Preparatory Committee to elaborate an annotated draft agenda and suggestingas a basis for the Preparatory Committee&apos;s discussions. a number of subjects which follow closely the headings in Cmd. 6709. Under the terms of theresolution the Preparatory Committee were to report to a subsequent sessionof the Council recommendations regarding the date and place of the full inter-national conference and the agenda (including a draft convention) and also whatStates, if any, not members of the United Nations should be invited to the fullinternational conference. The Preparatory Committee consists of the countriesinvited by the United States to attend the meeting of drafting countries withthe addition of Chile, the Lebanon and Norway. This resolution provides thenecessary link between the United States initiative in calling the meeting of drafting countries (consisting of the majority of the principal trading nations)and the full international conference of which the United Nations Organisationappears to be the inevitable sponsor.4. When, in December, the United States spoke of convening the meetingof drafting countries in Marcher April of this year it was expected that by thattime the Financial Agreement would already have secured Congressional approval.Shortly afterwards the United States Government told us informally that theycontemplated calling the meeting in July. When the Congressional debates seemed likely to be more prolonged, they notified us, again informally, that it would haveto be postponed until September. As the debate in the Senate dragged on theUnited States Government became increasingly reluctant to commit themselveseven to September. It now appears that there can be no certainty of finalCongressional action before Congress rises which may be as late as the middleof July. They have now informed us in strict confidence that the meeting of drafting countries cannot be held until March 1947. The reason is that theprocedure for the reduction of the United States tariff requires a public announce-ment of their intention to negotiate trade agreements and the publication of a listof all the items on which tariff reductions will be considered. These announcementshave to be made at least 90 days in advance of any formal negotiations and theyconsider it inexpedient to make them until Congressional approval of theFinancial Agreement is assured or so shortly before the November elections as would be necessary if Congressional approval is not given until the middle of July.5. The Americans are disturbed at the delay which their estimate of theirown political exigencies has forced upon them and by the consequent postponement of the meeting of &quot;drafting&quot; countries. A representative of the AmericanEmbassy recently called at the Board of Trade leaving tentative proposals for action to be taken pending the meeting of &quot; drafting &quot; countries in March 1947.In considering these proposals, it is necessary to bear in mind that it has alwaysbeen contemplated that the work to be. done at the meeting of &quot; drafting &apos;&apos;countries would consist (a) of approving proposals for the establishment of aninternational trade organisation, of its constitution and of the rules of conductby which its members would undertake to abide in the whole field of commercial policy (including such matters as quantitative trade restrictions, the use of subsidies, state trading and so forth), and (b) of detailed bargaining for thereduction of tariffs and preferences. It has never been contemplated that thePreparatory Committee appointed by the Economic and Social Council should enter into (b) but that its work under (a) should be parallel to and perhapssynchronised with the meeting of &apos;&apos; drafting &apos;&apos; countries (the membership of bothbeing to a large extent common).: &apos;   &quot;ANNEX B.Note on the Argument in Paragraph 5 (a).1. The American &quot;Proposals&quot; in Cmd. 6709 cover a wide field ranging from the machinery of the suggested International Trade Organisation andgeneral commercial provisions to the detailed reduction of tariffs. Matters tohe discussed are quantitative trade restrictions, subsidies, state trading, exchange control, restrictive business practices and intergovernmental commodity arrange-ments.  Some of them, such as the machinery provisions, and the sections dealing
with general commercial provisions and restrictive business practices can perhaps be discussed separately on a multilateral basis without too close connection withother subjects. The object of this note is to explain why it is important to resist any tendency to seek definitive agreements on some of the other items at a con-ference which is not dealing with the detailed bargaining on tariffs.2. It is greatly in our interests to secure the greater and freer developmentof multilateral trade which is the object of these proposals, but it will be apparent that they hang together and neither reduction of tariffs without the removal of,e.g., quantitative restrictions nor the abolition of the latter without substantiallowering of tariffs will have the desired effect. Different countries have relied on different means of protection. The United States has had a very high tariff,France and New Zealand have depended in the main on quantitative restrictions.3. Tariffs can be dealt with only by a series of bilateral negotiations. Therecan be no common yard stick to measure the value to each of a dozen different countries of a specific tariff concession. Nor would a general formula be possiblebecause both the absolute height and the relative protective effect of tariffs varyvery widely. On the Other hand, the sections on quantitative restrictions and exchange control must be discussed multilaterally because of the importance of getting a generally accepted code of conduct and some system of checks in respectof practices which in some circumstances may be just and appropriate, but may also be capable of gross misuse which would defeat all the other objects which arepursued in the American &quot; Proposals.&quot;4. But as some of the countries taking part in the discussions depend onsuch measures for their protection it seems clear that they will be unable to commit themselves to any firm agreement which would be satisfactory to the otherstaking part in the discussions unless at the same time they see arising from con-current bilateral talks assured and substantial reduction of tariffs elsewherewhich will compensate them. It may be doubted also whether, if the two wereseparated and no clear agreement reached before the tariff discussions opened,the high tariff countries would then be prepared to consider such reductions aswe for our part must secure.5. We have therefore taken the view in all our talks with the americans that the forthcoming discussions can be entirely successful only if there is con-current examination of both tariffs and the more general proposals. And wehave resisted suggestions that there should be preliminary discussion of thelatter because we have felt that if they were divorced from the detailed tariffbargaining there would be no pressure on countries to agree and every objectionwould be stated at its highest, with the serious risk that the discussions would end in an atmosphere of failure and suspicion. We are, however, now underthe compulsion to find some means of keeping alive interest in the american proposals until the tariffs can be discussed next year. This paper proposes thatwe should suggest to the Americans that there should simply be a purely explora-tory and educative meeting (see paragraph 7B). What we must avoid if possible is any attempt to discuss definitive drafts on the other subjects before there isalso discussion of detailed tariff reductions.
