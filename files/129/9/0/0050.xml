/X. /YV,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTS E C RI   CP.   (46.)  200Copy No. jr21st May A 1946...  :.- --eg CABINET..SUPPLIES___OF_HOME    GROWN    WHEATMcmior andun by the . Minister of Agriculture, and Fisheries arid the. -Secretary of State for scotland. At the meeting of the Cabinet on 17th May (CM. (46) 49Conclusion 2) v/e were asked, in consultation with the Minister of Pood,to take immediate&apos; steps to draw off remaining stocks of wheat from .-arms   in the U.K.  and. report to the Cabinet the measures taken and theamount./likely... t;o be secured.      We were also asked to arrange for theearly threshing of a substantial proportion of the wheat of this yearIsharvest. . -Balance of 1945 Crop2. It is proposed to initiate intensive propaganda to urge farmers to thresh the remainder of their 1945 wheat crop as&quot;soon as possible and a personal appeal will be made by the    Minister of Agriculture to farmers on the wireless as the soearhead of this drive.:    /Instructionswill also be given to all threshing contractors to give- a-preference to those farmers who have wheat to thresh and to defer, where necessary,.  the threshing of other grain.3. We have considered whether it would be desirable to follow the example of the U.S.A.  Government and. offer a cash bonus for all wheatdelivered during the next four weeks,.but do not favour this course.The bulk of the remaining stock of wheat is already likely to bethreshed- and delivered before the end of June while the peak of the seasonal scale of prices also operates in June and July..      On generalrounds it is unwise to vary price scales at short notice and the  offer of such a bonus would,  in our view.set a precedent which might be embarrassing in the future.      Nor do we believe that the additionalcjuantity  which might be secured during the next three or four weeksrould be sufficient to  justify such a step.As a corollary to these measures the Minister of Pood will takefill possible steps to ensure the  immediate acceptance by merchants andpillers of any wheat offered to them by farmers, even if it involve some uneconomic transport of wheat about the country to ensure withoutliala]^ its utilisation or storage.It is estimated that on 18th May approximately 160,000 tons offheat suitable for milling remained on farms,  or was in process of1&apos;ovement off farms,  and. may be expected to be delivered for millingfore the end of July.      The bulk of it should come forward by thend of June.      The earlier this balance of the  1945 crop can be obtainedrorn farms the smaller the wastage&apos;.      Moreover the proposed drive forarly delivery will impress upon farmers the importance of making theaximum contribution towards closing the gap in our requirements andhould facilitate heavier threshings of the new crop in August andjcptember.
sEarly Tlircshinr; of  1946 Crop6. The Quantity of wheat which can ho threshed, and delivered tomills in the first two months of the season (August and September) is jdependent In part: upon wo at ho reconditions-which .affect the date ofriponlhg&apos; and&apos; the&apos; actual harvestingbf&quot;&apos;thc grain/ and&quot; partly upon thenumber of threshing sets and combine harvesters that are available.Those rather than tho actual size of the crop are the determiningfactors.      There will he approximately an additional 500 combine       \harvesters in operation,  as compared with last year- which alone wouilbe capable of threshing&apos;an additional  100,000 tons of grain.7. Following the decision of the Agricultural Wages Board toraise the minimum wages of men and women by 10/- per week it willbe necessary-to hold a special review of-agricultural prices and the  BFarmers&apos; &quot;Unions will no doubt sock-additions to -prices of the  1946crops to meet tho increased costs of harvesting.     Me are submitting Ia separate paper to our colleagues on this issue-; but as a means of    -jinducing the parly marketing of1 the  1946 crop of whc&apos;at--we intend to&apos;   jpropose that a substantial, proportion- of any increase that may begranted in the annual average price&apos; of wheat should be used as apremium for wheat sold off farms during the months -of&quot;-August and september.&apos;     The remaining part would be spread over wheat pricesduring the rest of the.-season.      The question whether this proposal    i will need any adjustment for Scotland; where the harvest is later,  is being -examined. .8. The vigorous publicity campaign will also be undertaken to stimulate the early threshing of wheat instead of other grain anddirections given, to thro shin,   contractors to give a markedpreference to- fanners wishing to -thresh wheat.9.       . The maximum quantity that can be handled by the millers andby the Ministry of Food is 80,000 tons per week,  i.e.  approximately. I650^, 000 tons during August and September.-     We estimate that given,    Ireasonably favourable weather and with the  stimulus we propose to -apply,  total deliveries for milling from farmers in this period shoiiic Iamount to 420,000 tons.      The highest quantity delivered to inills inthese two months during the war years was some 372,000 tons in 1943.10.        On this basis there would be an addition of some ,145,000 tons  Iand possibly as much as  195,0-00 tons to the previous &quot;more opt imistic1estimate of home grown supplies (275,000 tons) during this period.Wo consider that  it would be reasonable to rely very largely on large:supplies from home sources to safeguard our- stock position rather thaito take a more pessimistic view and introduce further drastic economicin the usage of wheat and&apos; flour which would inflict further serious damage to our livestock industry.mi W.J.
