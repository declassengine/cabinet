DOCUiMSNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)S S C R E TCP.(46)  17429TH  APRIL. 1946.cabinet proposed INCREASE IN CHARGES OF CONTROLLEDRAILWAYS .AKD LONDON PASSENGER TR.AI&quot;SPORT board memorandum by the Minister of transport.     During the operation of the present Railways Agreement,the main items of receipts have been -1941     1942     1943     1944      1945 m         m         m         m         mPassengers (including    132.1    163.5   186.3    194.6    210,6parcels and mails)Freight , 158.8.  176.7   190.9    196.0   169.72.      The net revenues of the Pool Account (including docks and other ancillary business) have exceeding the fixedannual payments to the controlled undertakings ( 43.5 n) bythe following amounts....941 1942 1943 1944 1945&apos;  m  rn  m  m  m21.7 45.7 62.1 46.8 19.03.      The Railway Executive Committee estimate that, for theyear 1946, the position will bet-Receipts from Passengers (including -parcels and nails)  180,7m.Receipts from Freight  136.8m.Net revenue of Pool - a loss of  4.1 m, which wouldhave to be nade/by the Government, in addition tothe fixed annual sun, thus involving a charge onthe Exchequer of  47.6 m.Many factors of unccrtainty affect this estimate, but I annot in a position to substitute any alternative figures which would be more reliable.4.      The original financial orrangenents with  the controlledundertakings provided that charges would be ad justed- to meetvariations in working costs and certain other conditionsarising from the war.      The Railway Executive Committee wereto submit to the Minister of Transport quarterly estimates     Iof the effect of these variations and proposals for any consequential increase in charges.      The Minister was to      . &apos;examine  the estimates and proposals and, Unless he considered;it unnecessary or undesirable, was to s^ek the advice of a     jConsultative Committee consisting of the three pernahent Imembers of tho Railway-Rntos Tribunal acting in an advisory jcapacity, -1- -   jCOPY NO.
5.     In accordance with these arrangements, increases weremade in 1940, at tho end of which year the followingincreases over pre-war charges were in opcration:-Preight Rates . 16^/3%pares of Railway Companies   16/3% (10% workmen&apos;s fares and season ticket rates)t. p t b on ordinary road androll fared of Id. nnd Ifcd.and on workmen&apos;s faros of id.and 2d. on certain road services.     Rail fares(other than cheap day) -10$ subject to fractionsrules which resulted in no increase applying to faresof 2d.A 3d., and 4d.    Cheapdajr 16^/3%.      Coaches -16^/5% (10% season tickets).Eo further increases have been made since the end of 1940.6.     During 1941 to 1945, in spite of this stabilisation of charges and of a steep increase in costs (now 70% over pre-war) , the exceptionally heavy Government traffic and passengertrain loading produced receipts so great as to yield netrevenues exceeding, by the amounts shown above,  the fixedannual sum based on pre-war net revenues.      The drastic changeforecast for 1946 is attributable to the rate at which thesewar-time conditions are disappearing.V.     In view of the deficiency now anticipated I proposedthat the rates and fares of the Main Line Companies and theLondon Passenger Transport Board should be raised to theextent estimated to be necessary to enable the Control account to meet its obligations, and that the question of how the required additional revenue could best be raised should bereferred to the Consultative Committee mentioned above.    Thisproposal was considered by the Lord President&apos;s Committee on16th April, 1946.      It was agreed in principle that during1946 there v/ould have to be an increase in the fares of theBoard and the charges of the Railway Companies, and I v/asinvited  to arrange for the preparation of the terms ofreference to the Committee in consultation with the Treasury,the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Labour and NationalService and then to circulate a memorandum to the Cabinetsetting out my proposals.8.     It had been suggested that, in order to avoid anadditional burden on industry at this critical time, theincrease should be applied wholly to passenger fares.    I seegrave ob lections to this suggestion.     On the estimates beforeno, the increase would need to be about 1B% over proarentfares or about 57^55 over pre-war fares, without making any allowance for loss of traffic due to the increase.    Insofarthe increase would.fall upon workmen and season-ticketholders, it would react on the cost of living index to someextent and might lend  to wage demands to offset the increased cost of travel.     There are also other considerations:    forexample, we are having to subsidise coastal shipping rates to enable coasters to compete against the pegged railway charges.      An increase in the latter would go some way towards narrowing the gap between rairatoB at 16 /Z% over pre-war and coastal rates which, without the subsidy, wouldbe generally 75/J over pre-war.      Tho artificial level, of rail-&apos;&quot;ny rates also causes difficulties in connection with canals.

The drastic changeforecast for 1946 is attributable to the rate at which thesewar-time conditions are disappearing.7,      In view of the deficiency now anticipated I proposedthat the rates and fares of the Main Line Companies and theLondon Passenger Transport Board should be raised to theextent estimated  to be necessary to enable the Control account to meet its obligations, and that the question of how the required additional revenue could best be raised should bereferred to the Consultative Committee mentioned above.    Thisproposal was considered by the Lord President&apos;s Committee on16th April, 1946.      It was agreed in principle  that during1946 there would have to be an increase in the fares of theBoard and the charges of  the Railway Companies, and I was invited  to arrange for the preparation of the  terms ofreference to  the Committee in consultation with the Treasury,the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Labour and NationalService and then to circulate a memorandum to the Cabinetsetting out my proposals.8.      It had been suggested that, in order to avoid anadditional burden on industry at this critical time,  theincrease should be applied wholly to passenger fares.    I seegrave objections to this  suggestion.      On the estimates beforeme, the increase would need to be about g5% over presentfares or about 57-gfS over pre-war fares, without making any allowance for loss of  traffic due to the increase.    insofar as the increase would fall upon workmen and season-ticketholders, it would react on the cost of living index to someextent and might lead   to wage demands to offset the increased cost of travel.      There are also other considerations:    forexample, we are having to subsidise coastal shipping rates to. enable coasters to compete against the pegged railway charges.      An increase in the latter would go some way towards narrowing the gap between raiLrates at 16 /3% over pre-war and coastal rates which, without the subsidy, wouldbe generally 73% over pre-war.      The artificial level of rail-way rates also causes difficulties in connection with canals.

9.      The terms of reference which I proposed would ask theCommittee, proceeding on the basis of estimates of grossreceipts which would be indicated,  to  advise as to the best method of increasing charges from 1st July, 1946, so as toproduce additional receipts at the rate of  56 m. a year.For this purpose they would be asked to  hold a public enquiryat which they should hear any representative body oftraders or passengers,  or local authority, who have given notice of desire to be heard in the manner and within thetime prescribed by the Committee.      The  target figure of 56 rn.  a year was designed to make good part of the deficiency which would have accrued before the increased charges cane  into force and to secure equilibrium over theperiod 1st April, 1946 to 31st December,  1947.10.      In the Inter-Departmental discussions the following areamong the points raised.      That the next six to nine months would be an inopportune time to increase charges owing tothe effect on the cost of living, wage negotiations, pricestructures  and trade expansion.      That, as the Governmenthas, in the last five years, made a profit of nearly  200 m.from the operation of the Railway Agreement,  they should beprepared to boar for a period some part at least of theestimated deficiency in order  to  stabilise charges.      Thatthe  estimates of traffic are uncertain.    That the committee could not conduct an adequate inquiry in time  to permit anincrease being brought &quot;into  operation by 1st July.    Thattime should be allowed for conditions to stabilise and for a fuller investigation in order to arrive at a reasonablylong-term adjustment of charges.11.      Apart from the cost to  the Exchequer, I see otherserious objections  to continuing,  in the hope of a moreopportune time to increase-? charges arising later, to leavecharges  at an artificial  and uneconomic level wholly out of line with increases in costs.      Moreover, the argument thatthe time is not opportune will be likely  to be brought up infavou.r of a policjr of procrastination, whenever we come to face the necessity for an increase  in charges.       The profits in past years were due in part to  the substantial payments by the Government for passenger and goods traffic;   in anycase,  the profits have already gone to  the Exchequer inrelief of taxation or borrowing.13.      I agree that there must be uncertainty in the estimates of traffic.    But, on the other hand , we are far from safe in assuming, as I have done, that the level of railway expendi-ture in the next twelve months will not increase over thatof 1945.      I  also agree that a limited and necessarily briefenquiry would be all that would be possible if it is to &apos;precede an increase in charges as from 1st July.    In thesecircumstances,  there are arguments for making, without reference to the Committee or public inquiry,  an immediate increase, conservative in amount,  and asking the Committee toundertake a detailed inquiry for the purposes of a long-termadjustment of charges.      Such an  inquiry could cover not onlythe method of adjustment,  but also an examination of theestimates of future receipts. &apos;    The Committee would be ableto base upon later and firmer information as to futureconditions and any adjustment of charges made after the inquiry might Well prove to be capable of continuation up  to,and for a period  after, nationalisation.      The inquiry wouldalso afford an opportunity of dealing with special problemssuch as  that created by low exceptional railway rates granted in the past to meet competition from other forms&apos;of trans-port, particularly coastwise shipping.

13.      If,  therefore,  it is felt that we can act without giving railway users any opportunity of making representations,I propose  that as from 1st July, or earlier if this should prove practicable, railway charges should be increased from16/3% over pre-war to 33-53% (workmen&apos;s fares and seasonticket rates from 10$ to 2 5%).      In each.case the increase would be about one-seventh of the present charges.      Asimilar increase to be applied to  the charges of the RailwayCompanies&apos;   ancillary businesses including collection and delivery,  docks and canals.      On present estimates, without allowing for any loss of traffic due to the increase, .thiswould produce on additional gross revenue of about  42 a.a year, which, with the proposal I make in the next paragraph,would go f ar ,towards meeting the current loss, leaving theExchequer to bear  the losses incurred before the increasesbegin to  take effect.14.      The charges of the London Passenger Transport Boardpresent a special problem.      It is  estimated  that an increasein gross revenue of about  2-g- m.  a year would be necessary  to balance  the Board&apos;s contribution to&apos;, and claim against, theControl Pool,      As a large proportion of the Board&apos;s revenueis derived   from fares of 1-Jd,  to 4d. ,  and the correspondingrates for season tickets, it is difficult to find any simplefare adjustment which would produce an increase in revenue ofthis amount.      I propose to  explore this  question with theBoard,  and,  if it proves possible to find a satisfactory method of making such an increase,  to bring the increase intooperation concurrently with the railway increase.    If,however, it is found that a detailed inquiry is necessaryto arrive at a meth-d of increase, or  that an appreciableperiod is required  to put an increase into effect,, then itwould be necessary  to make  the change in the Board&apos;s charges&apos;at a later date.15.      If these proposals are approved,  I. would desire to have authority,  to make an immediate announcement in parliamentof the increases, of the date (the earliest possible) onwhich they would come into operation, and of the intentionto make a reference to the Committee.A.B.Ministry of Transport,29TH  APRIL,  1946.
