(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)S E C R E.TCP. (1+6)  181+1ST MAY.   19h7.cabinet united KINGDOM WHEAT AND FLOUR POSITIONJoint Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries and the Secretary of State for scotland in his paper (C, P. (1+6)  182) the Minister of Pood proposesfurther economies in the consumption of wheat and flour,including an increase in the extraction rate to 90%,  although his previous proposal to make such a change was rejected by theCabinet after considerable discussion as recently as 21+th April.2.        It was recognised on that occasion that an increase in the extraction rate would involve deterioration in the keepingqualities of bread and a heavy loss in animal feedingstuffs,which would be lasting in its effects upon the production of meat, milk and eggs.3.       The figures of arrivals, home production,  consumption and stocks of wheat and flour during the period April to September,191+6, circulated by the Minister of Pood,  show that the positionis substantially the same &apos;as when the Cabinet last discussed thissubject.      On the more optimistic estimate of the supply position the end-September stocks would be equivalent to about 8 weeks&apos;supply.      This estimate allows for deliveries from home farms toflour mills in August and September of 275,000 tons of wheatcompared with 323,000 tons in the corresponding months of 191+5and 350,000 tons in 1 91+1+.      With an additional 500 combineharvesters more of the home crop is likely to be threshed in thefirst two months of the season, and unless the weather at harvesttime is exceptionally bad, the above  estimate of deliveriesshould be readily realised and. even exceeded.1+.        At the end of September there will also remain on farms thebalance of this yearfs home crop which might be estimated at,1+00,000 tons after allowing for full seed requirements and sales in August and September.      The bulk of this stock should be suitable for milling.5. .     The diversion of coarse grains to human consumption in themore needy countries is already likely to reduce substantiallyour supplies of imported animal feedingstuffs and unless somesteps can be taken to increase our prospective supplies,  some further cut in ration scales for pigs and poultry,  and probablyfor dairy cows, seems inevitable before next winter, withdisastrous consequential effects upon home production of meat,milk and eggs, from which it may take a long time to recover.It is stated in CP. (1+6) 168, Appendix A,  that, the latest estimateof arrivals of maize, barley and oats in the first half of 191+6is only 211,000 tons compared with an original programme of552,000 tons,  and a similar short-fall of arrivals belowprogramme requirements may very well eventuate during the second half of 191+6.f&apos;5 &apos;-)7 OjCOPY NO. ^* &amp;

6.       An increase in the extraction rate to 30% would mean a loss in feeding stuffs at the rate of 300,000 tons per annum and would seriously aggravate the reduction in supplies offeedingstuffs with which,  on present prospects, we are alreadyfaced.&apos;     This quantity of feeding stuff s would produce roughly800,000 cwts.  of pigmeat or 160 million gallons of milk or500 million eggs.      Moreover,  the deterioration in the keepingquality of bread made from 90% extraction flour is likely toincrease the wastage and thus diminish the  saving in wheat which might otherwise be expected.7.       If the Cabinet consider that it is essential to make further immediate economies in the consumption of wheat and flour we would strongly urge our colleagues to avoid doing soby an increase in the extraction rate to 90% or by any othermeasure which would lead to a substantial consequentialreduction in the supply of animal feeding stuffs..      By raising the extraction rate the Minister of Pood hopes to effect a saving of 100,000 tons of wheat by the end of September.      Ifthe output of cake and flour confectionery were reduced by25% the saving by the end of September would be &quot;approximatelyhO,000 tons, assuming that his present proposal to reduce by12-2% the allocation of sugar and fats used by. cake manufacturers,leads to a reduction of half that percentage in the usage of flour.      If a strong propaganda drive to induce farmers to sell the maximum quantity of wheat in August and September isundertaken the home grown supply of wheat in those months mightbe increased by a further 25,000 or even&apos; 50,000 tons.      some reduction might also be made in the sale of loose flour to thepublic as a means of bringing the total saving by thesealternative measures to somewhere near the 100,000 tons that.isexpected by raising the rate of extraction to 90%.8..       These alternative proposals would have no long term effect and could be introduced or discontinued at relatively short notice, without any material  influence upon the supplies of animal feedingstuffs and hence upon the output of livestock products.      We realise&apos; the objection to a rationing scheme forbread and flour but we suggest very strongly to our colleagues that such a scheme would nevertheless be preferable to theMinister of Pood&apos;s first proposal if further cuts in consumptionhave to be enforced.T.W.J.W.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.1ST MAY,   1946.
