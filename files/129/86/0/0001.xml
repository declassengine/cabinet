(TpiS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT) ECRET^ . :C.(57) 51 COPY NO. ^ ^1st March, 1957.CABINETCHRISTMAS ISLANDMem or andum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations and the Secretary of State for the colonies the Chief M;nister of Singapore, Mr. Lim Yew Hock,is due to begin discussions in London with the Colonial Secretary on11th March on the future Constitution of Singapore.    It will then benecessary to explain to him what plans we have in view for theadministration of Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean which, at present,forms part of the Colony of Singapore.2. Our colleagues will recall (annex to CoF.(56) 196) thatin March of last year the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr. Menzies)informed S:r Anthony Eden that the Australian Government had strongeconomic and defence interests in Christmas Island.     (There areextensive phosphate deposits and the Island lies along the line ofprojection of the Australian rocket range).    Mr. Menzies then urgedthat the Island should not remain under the Singapore Government whenthe next constitutional stage was reached, but should be detached from singapore and either hasdedover to Australian administration oradministered separately by the United Kingdom Government.3. When the matter was considered by the Cabinet in october last (CM.(56) 68th Conclusions), it was in principle agreed that:-(a) Christmas Island should be severed fromthe administration of the Government of singapore.(b) While Singapore had no legal right to compensation,that Government should continue to receive thepresent net revenues from the Island - approximately 130,000 per annum - for so long as the phosphatedeposits were being worked.(c) The Governor of Singapore should be consulted as to the steps necessary to carry outconclusions (a) and (b) above.(d) The question whether the Island should subsequently be administered by Australia or as a United Kingdomdependency should be left for further consideration.
4, The Australian and New Zealand Governments - the latteralso having a direct interest in the phosphate deposits - were informed in the above sense, as were the Governor of Singapore and theCcrnmissioner-Gensral for the United Kingdom in South East Asia.After discussion with the Governors of the other British territories in the area, the Commissioner-General and the Governor reportedthat while it would be possible to make ad hoc arrangements for the separate administration of Christmas Island, the unanimous feelinglocally was that Singapore should not continue to receive revenuesfrom the Island.    Any continuing annual payment would carry thepresumption that Singapore had a right to such payments and a continuing interest in the Island.    This would defeat the objective ofobtaining a clear separation.    The Commissioner-General therefore recommended that the link with Singapore should be cut at one stroke,and that compensation should be made in the form of an ex gratia lump sum payment.5. In face of this unanimous advice, we have considered whether a lump sum could be paid from United Kingdom funds.    Weare, however, satisfied that it would not be possible to justify this.It would be difficult to defend before Parliament the payment of acomparatively large sum to the Singapore Government simply because we had chosen, for no apparent reason, to administer the Islanddifferently.     The only justification which could be given would bethe public acknowledgment that the action was being taken because of australian and New Zealand interests in the Island, and that the sums involved were to be reimbursed by Australia and New Zealand.6. The Australian Government, on their own initiative,recently  sent an official delegation to London for discussions on christmas Island.    In the circumstances the whole question of the Island&apos;future has now been discussed with them and with New Zealandrepresentatives.    They have since informed us that, subject to theagreement of the United Kingdom Government, their respective governments agree that the Island should be transferred to Australianadministration at the time when the new Singapore Constitution comes into effect.7. The Governor and the Commissioner-General whom wehave since consulted, support this proposal.    They consider that transfer to Australia is not likely to provoke any more hostile reaction from singapore than the separation of the Island and its administration bythe United Kingdom Government, and that, provided the Singapore government are given reasonably generous compensation, no realdifficulties should arise. tBoth from the political view point and from that of the widerCommonwealth interest, we are now convinced that transfer toAustralia is the proper solution.    The sole activity on the Island is themining of phosphates by a Commission, owned jointly by the australian and New Zealand Governments.    It is, therefore, perfectly defensiblethat at the time when the Singapore Government assume responsibilityfor their own internal affairs, we should transfer the administrationof this Island to one of the only Governments to have any direct interestin it.    The break with Singapore would thus be complete and final.We are further influenced by the fact that the difficult contingent problemof administering so remote a territory by ad hoc arrangements wouldlapse. , So far as United Kingdom defence interests are concerned, theChiefs of Staff, who were consulted at the time of Mr, Menzies&apos; request,
while agreeing that the construction of an airstrip could give the Islandimportance as an air staging post, recommended that from a military-point of view, it would also be better for its administration to betransferred to Australia.     We should add that a transfer of this kind is not without precedent.     In 1955, for instance, following a request from the Australian Government that the administration of the Cocos(Keeling) Islands should be transferred to Australia in order to permit the Australian Government to develop a staging point for a civil airservice between Australia and South Africa, an Act (the Gocos IslandsAct) was passed by Parliament at Westminster.8. Should our proposal for the transfer of Christmas island to Australia be approved, we are assured that the Australian and NewZealand Governments would be ready to leave to the United KingdomGovernment the negotiation on their behalf of an adequate ex gratiapayment to the Government of Singapore.     While the exact amount would have to be subject to local advice, we have been informed bythe two Governments that we could pay a sum of up to  2,000,000 withoutfurther reference to them and that we could thereafter look to themfor full reimbursement.    We have at the same time considered whether we should seek additional compensation from Australia on the basis that the United Kingdom Government were depriving themselves ofa revenue producing asset.    We believe, however, that it would be out of keeping with the spirit in which matters of this kind should bearranged within the Commonwealth that we should now insist that theAustralian Government, in addition to paying compensation to Singapore,should also reimburse the United Kingdom in respect of revenues whichare both small in size and which we have never to date directly enjoyed.Our High Commissioner in Canberra, who has been consulted on thispoint, strongly recommends against an attempt to seek additional compensastion.9. We have been further informed that in the event of transfertaking place, the Australian Government would be prepared to give assurances,on the lines of those given when the Cocos Islands were transferred to them, covering the citizenship and immigration rightsof the few phosphate workers resident on Christmas Island, and ofdependents subsequently born there.10. To sum up, we feel that the transfer of Christmas island to Australian administration is, from the economic and defence viewpoint,and in the general political and Commonwealth interest, the most practical solution in the light of the coming constitutional changes in singapore.     We therefore seek the authority of our colleagues so toinform the Australian and New Zealand Governments.    At the same time we seek authority to instruct the Governor of Singapore to inform mr. JLim Yew Hock of our intentions and to negotiate the payment of an ex gratia sum to the Singapore Government within an overall limit of  2,00&quot;0,OOQ.H.A.L..-B.1st March, 1957.
