THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 6411th March, 1957CABINETORGANISATION OF MINISTERIAL WORKNote by the Prime minister am concerned at the burden of work which rests on Ministers andparticularly on senior Ministers having charge of Departments. Many of mycolleagues are under a strain which represents a real threat to efficiency and, in thelong run, to health. There is no prospect that this will be lessened, in the monthsahead, by a relaxation of the pressure of public business. We cannot, therefore,look for any automatic relief. If we are to have relief, we must secure it by adjusting our own methods of work.  I offer the following suggestions.Departmental business. In the Departments and in Parliament the best means of lightening the load on Ministers is to find means of devolving more work to Ministers of Stateand Parliamentary Secretaries. To the extent that it can be done, this will yielda double benefit: it will relieve the strain on Departmental Ministers, and it willalso broaden the experience and increase the confidence of junior Ministers. on both grounds I ask all Ministers in charge of Departments to consider earnestlywhat more can be done in this direction.3. There is no sovereign remedy: circumstances differ in different departments. In some it may be convenient to delegate whole subjects to a juniorMinister. A clear-cut arrangement of this kind has the advantage that it can bemade plain, to Parliament and to interested parties, that within the limits of broadpolicy directions by the Minister responsibility for day-to-day administration rests with the junior Minister. Thus, on subjects delegated to him, the junior Ministercan answer all letters from Members of Parliament and he may be able to deal withbusiness (debates and minor legislation) in the House.In other Departments it may be more convenient that the junior minister should act as a deputy over the whole range of the Department^ work. But, ifsuch an arrangement is adopted, it is the more important that he should be encouraged to settle as much as he can without reference to the Minister.
4. In general, I believe that Ministers are being asked to devote too muchof their time to small, though politically difficult, points of administration and are,in consequence, unable to give enough thought to the larger issues of policy andto the problems of presentation which are their special responsibility. This was certainly my experience, and I believe it to be general. It would be a great gain,all round, if junior Ministers could take over more of the responsibility for settling the political problems which arise in administration, so that the Ministers in chargeof Departments could be more free to concern themselves with major policy.5. To the extent that their practical share in the work of the deparment is increased, it is the more important that junior Ministers should have.clearly inmind the formal limits of their authority. Constitutionally it is the Minister alonewho is answerable to Parliament for his Department; and, while a parliamentary secretary may be authorised to supervise the day-to-day administration of specificsubjects, this arrangement cannot relieve the Minister of his ultimate responsibilityfor policy.Collective Business6. We all deplore the amount of time we have to devote to meetings of theCabinet and its Committees. We could, by taking thought, reduce it. Thefollowing points are elementary; but, if we all keep them clearly in mind and actedon them always, we could reduce substantially the time we spend in collectivediscussion.7. Matters falling wholly within the jurisdiction of a single Minister oftenneed not be brought up for collective discussion at all. Each Minister must judge whether such a question is so important that it ought to be brought to the noticeof his colleagues. A Minister who is in doubt can seek guidance from me or fromthe Chairman of the appropriate Cabinet Committee.8. A Minister should not submit a question to the Cabinet or a CabinetCommittee merely because it concerns one or more other Ministers. This may seem an easier course than to arrange a meeting with those directly concerned;but, unless the collective responsibility of the Government is involved, it wastesthe time of the other members of the Cabinet or the Committee who are not directly concerned.9. Discussion in Cabinet occupies more Ministerial man-hours thandiscussion in a Cabinet Committee. This should be one of the considerations which a Minister takes into account in deciding whether a paper should besubmitted to a Committee or to the Cabinet itself.10. Finally, brevity in documents and in discussion can make the biggestsingle contribution to the expeditious despatch of public business.   .H. M.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,8th March, 1957.
