Economic Survey 1957(1) introduction. In 1956 the Governments measures to relieve the inflationary strain onthe economy came into full effect. The rise in prices and profits was checkedduring the year. Exports increased substantially and imports showed little change. The trade gap was therefore greatly reduced and there was an appreciable surplus on the balance of payments, in contrast to the deficit of1955. The volume of fixed investment expanded further, whereas personal consumption remained at its 1955 level. This emphasis on exports and investment led to changes in the pattern of industrial output. While theproduction of capital goods and of goods for export continued to rise, outputof vehicles and durable household goods fell. The redeployment of our resources which this involved necessarily resulted in a temporary check to our industrial growth, and the oil shortage which has followed the closing of the suez Canal and of the Iraq Petroleum Company pipeline is now also having a restraining effect.2. The next three sections of the Survey consider in some detail thecourse of economic events in 1956. Section 2 paints in the world back-ground, which is of vital importance to a trading country like Britain whoseprosperity depends on a high level of international trade. Section 3describes the United Kingdom economy in 1956. It considers first thenational income and expenditure accounts, then the five sectors of demand fixed investment, stocks, Government expenditure, consumers&apos; expenditure and exports and their impact on production, imports and employment. the movements of costs and prices are considered next and finally financialand monetary developments. Section 4 deals with overseas trade and payments, and makes a particular examination of the capital account inthe balance of payments. The final section considers the prospects for thefuture, both at home and abroad.(2) the world background3. The boom in world trade continued in 1956. Outside the UnitedKingdom and the United States industrial production rose as fast or nearly as fast as in 1955. Commodity prices generally fell slightly up to the endof the year, but the closing of the Suez Canal then led to some moderateincreases. The primary producing countries were reasonably prosperous,though less so than the manufacturing countries. The outflow of gold and dollars from the United States continued at a high rate.4. Total industrial production in the United States fluctuated over the yearbecause of a prolonged recession in the car industry and a steel strike in July, and at the end of the year it was only 2 per cent higher thanat the end of 1955. The output of most industries other than the steel and car industries rose steadily through the year and in the latter halfof the year steel output resumed its upward course; car production alsopicked up in the autumn, though not to its record 1955 level.5. For Western Europe 1956 was another year of expansion, althoughthe unusually severe winter caused a temporary slowing down in the first quarter, with particularly adverse effects for agriculture and the buildingindustries, and there were signs of a further slowing down in the second half of the year.   Between 1955 and 1956 the industrial production of the.
Continental European countries combined rose by per cent. France,Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands showed the greatest growth,the increase in France being particularly marked. Production in the scandinavian countries continued to be restrained by disinflationary policies.The chemical industries and the metal-using industries showed the greatestrate of growth, but the textile industries also shared in the expansion.The closing of the Suez Canal led to an immediate oil shortage in Europe,but the only industries to be seriously affected before the end of the year were the motor industries.6. Prices of finished goods in Western Europe remained generally stable in1953 and 1954, but in 1955 they started to rise under the influence of risingdemand, and this movement continued and in some cases accelerated in 1956.Some European countries, Scandinavia in particular, had taken restrictivemeasures, both monetary and fiscal, in 1955, to meet either inflationarytendencies or an adverse balance of payments, and in 1956 they were joined by other countries such as Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.There was a similar price movement in the United States, where a tight moneypolicy was pursued through most of 1956, and also in Japan.7. The prices of rubber and copper fell heavily during the year (thoughthe former was still well above its 1954 level), but other raw material prices remained generally firm. Wool prices improved during the year.The price of cocoa and of the poorer grades of coffee remained weak, but most other food prices were firm. Most commodity prices rose when the suez Canal was nationalised at the end of July, but subsequently fellback. When the Canal was closed in November prices rose again but mostincreases were not large. In addition to these increases there were more substantial rises in dry cargo and tanker shipping freights, which causedc.i.f. prices to rise more than f.o.b. prices.8. World trade in manufactured goods continued to expand at the samehigh rate as in 1955 : in the first nine months of 1956, it was 15 per cent higher by value than in the corresponding period of 1955. Although many-of the materials used by the expanding metal-using industries of WesternEuirope came from North America, the manufacturing countries also increased their imports from the primary producing countries, which there-fore shared in the general expansion of production and trade to a greater extent than in preceding years.9. Among countries in the sterling area, there was an improvement inAustralia^ balance of payments resulting both from the tightening of import restrictions and from a higher level of exports of wool and other products.New Zealand&apos;s position also improved : imports were kept in check and exports of meat and dairy products greatly increased. There was a verysharp rise in India&apos;s imports, as her development plans expanded; thisresulted in a substantial balance of payments deficit, which was largelymet by drawings upon India&apos;s sterling balances.10. The West African Colonies were affected by the low price of cocoa,but most of the other Colonies had a prosperous year. A striking feature of the year was the extent to which the Colonies as a whole increased their imports ; as a result their sterling balances did not rise significantly.11. The position of Latin American countries, which had not in generalshared in the general boom in 1955, improved in 1956, and this improvementextended not only to the oil and metal producing countries but also tothose which rely more on agricultural products. The area therefore provided a better market for goods from the manufacturing countries.
12. Apart from the United Kingdom, most countries outside the dollar area, with the notable exception of France, increased their gold and dollar reserves during the year, the total official reserves of countries outside theSoviet bloc rising by about billion during the year.   About a thirdof the total increase went to Western Germany, which continued to havea large surplus on its current trade balance. The United States had a rather higher current surplus, but with a continuing high level of military expenditure and aid and an increase in overseas investment the outflow ofgold and dollars to the rest of the world was maintained.(3) DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM economy in 1956National income and expenditure13. The gross national product rose by  1,250 million, in 1956, mostly onaccount of higher prices. The estimates are given in Table 1. There wasonly a very small increase in real demand ; home output rose little and imports were virtually unchanged. Changes in expenditure and supplies at constant prices are set out in Table 2.table 1 :   gross national product^)  million	1952	1953	1954	1955	1956Expenditure generating gross national					product:					Consumers&apos; expenditure    ......

Total expenditure at constant 1955 prices rose by  185 million between1955 and 1956 ; exports accounted for virtually the whole of this increase,and there was no significant change in domestic expenditure as a whole. Inthe previous year total expenditure at 1955 prices had risen by  910 million, 680 million arising from home demand. The increase in total expenditureof  185 million, or rather under 1 per cent, in 1956 was met by an increase of 165 million in home output and of  20 million in imports. This may be compared with the enormous increase in imports of  350 million in 1955.15. The check to the boom that is implied by these figures had become effective before the start of the Middle East crisis. The closing of the suez canal led within a few weeks to an oil shortage, but the only industry thatwas seriously affected by this before the end of 1956 was the motor industry.Recent developments in the oil situation are described in paragraph 99.16. Among the various classes of expenditure the most striking develop-ment in 1956 was the absence of any increase in consumers&apos; expenditure,after allowing for higher prices. Central and local government expenditure at constant prices rose by  50 million after falling, slightly in the two previous years. House-building continued to decline, and other fixed investment roseby only  95 million, less than half as much as in 1955. Stocks and work inprogress rose during the year, but the; increment is estimated to have been some  100 million less than in 1955. Exports of goods and services roseless than in 1955, but when allowance is made for the dock strike in 1954that delayed some exports into 1955 the underlying rate of increase of exportsof goods by volume, some 6 per cent a year, was higher in 1956.

Indeed over the period 1951 to 1956fixed investment has accounted for no less than one-third of the increase in national output.20. In the early part of the five-year period ending in 1956 housing wasthe expanding element. Since 1954 however the greatest expansion has beenin manufacturing industry and in the distributive and other services;expenditure in both these groups increased by about a third between 1954and 1956. Within manufacturing industry the largest increases between 1952and 1956 have been in the vehicle and paper and printing groups ofindustries. The volume of expenditure by these industries in 1956 was aboutdouble the 1952 level.Investment in stocks and work in progress21. From the limited amount of information available it appears that over1956 as a whole stocks rose, though rather less than in 1955. In the first haMof the year the rate of stock building was about the same as in the first half of 1955. In the second half of the year stocks&apos; declined ; this was partly due to the normal seasonal fall in retailers&apos; stocks, but in the last few weeks of the year there was a running down of stocks of oil and other importedcommodities following the closing of the Suez Canal.  Manufacturers&apos; stocks17. Fixed investment again rose in 1956, although the rate of expansionbegan to slacken in the course of the year. The increase is estimated at 55 million at 1955 prices, compared with  185 million in the previous year.There was a switch in emphasis from plant, machinery and vehicles to building. Public investment in housing continued to fall and private buildingalso declined slightly ; altogether 300,000 new houses were completed duringthe year. Other new building rose by 8^ per cent, a higher rate of expansionthan in previous years, but the rate of starts fell off in the second half of theyear. The increase in expenditure on plant, machinery and vehicles wasconsiderably smaller than in the (previous year, and expenditure on com-mercial vehicles fell sharply in the second half of the year.18. Expenditure on investment by different industry groups over the last fiveyears (at constant 1948 prices) is shown in Table 3. Manufacturing industryaccounted for the largest rate of increase between 1955 and 1956. within this group the chemical and paper and printing industries achieved the largestincreases. Expenditure by the fuel and power industries and in agriculture,forestry and fishing fell. To assist the Governmenfs general measures of restraint the programmes of the nationalised industries were reduced belowthe level originally planned.19. Despite some falling off in the rate of expansion in 1956 a notableincrease has been achieved over the last five years in the rate of fixed invest-ment at home, as is shown by Table 3. The volume of investment in 1956was nearly one-third above that in 1952, an increase more than proportionate to the increase in national output.fixed capital formation as percentage of gross national product

rose somewhat less than in 1955 but whereas in 1955 stocks of materials and fuel, finished goods and work in progress all rose by -much the same pro-portion, in 1956 finished goods accounted for a larger part of the total risein stocks and over the year as a whole they accounted for perhaps one-thirdof the total increase. This build-up in finished1 goods started late in 1955and continued till about mid-1956 and some part at least was involuntary.22. Government stocks, particularly of some non-ferrous metals and food-stuffs, were again reduced in 1956 but disposals were not as large as in 1955.Coal stocks showed no change between the end of 1955 and the end of 1956 ;at the beginning of the winter distributed coal stocks amounted to just under20 million tons, the highest level reached since the war. Steel stocks con-tinued to rise, mainly in the first half of the year; this was partly due tothe fact that in spite of a reduced demand from1 the metal-using industriesimports of steel continued at their high 1955 level into the first few monthsof 1956.Expenditure by public authorities23. Total current expenditure on goods and services by public authoritiesincreased by \\ per cent in real terms in 1956. At current prices, the increasein civilian expenditure by the Government and local authorities togetheramounted to about  165 million. Most of this was due to higher salaries inthe health services and education but there was also an increase of 7,500 inthe number of teachers employed1 and of about 120,000 in the school popula-tion. The increase of  135 million in defence expenditure was due partly tothe introduction of higher scales of pay and pensions for the Forces, partly to the Suez operation and partly to increased prices of equipment, and also because expenditure on research and development was higher than expected.Personal income and expenditure24. Personal income rose sharply between 1955 and 1956 although output was little above the level of the previous year. Estimates are set out inTable 4.  Total personal income rose by about  1,150 million or 1\ per cent,table 4:   personal income and expenditure  million	1952	1953	1954	1955	1956Wages and salaries   ............

the same proportion as in 1955. Wages and salaries went up by about  900million, or 9 per cent, as a result of increased rates of pay ; expenditure onForces&apos; pay rose by 12 per cent. Employers&apos; contributions to national insurance and pension funds rose by 8 per cent. The incomes of self-employed persons rose by less than 2 per cent; rent, dividends and interestby 4 per cent. Tax payments and national insurance contributions rose by 175 million, leaving disposable income about  1,000 million, or 7 per cent,higher than in 1955.25. Consumers&apos; expenditure rose by very much less than this: by about 570 million. The balance of personal savings is shown to rise by as muchas  430 million, bringing the total of personal savings up to over 9 percent of personal disposable income, a proportion considerably higher thanin. any previous year since the war. The increase of  570 million, or4J per cent, in consumers&apos; expenditure was wholly absorbed by higher prices. As Table 5 shows, no increase took place in the real volume of consumers&apos; expenditure. This resulted from a sharp fall in purchases of cars and durable household goods, offset by modest increases in other types of expenditure, including increases of 2 per cent in food consumption and in expenditure on clothing and footwear.table 5:   consumers&apos; expenditure	  million at 1948 prices					Per cent change		1952	1953	1954	1955	1956	1954-	1955-						1955	1956Food     ......	2,421	2,509	2,599	2,627	2,645	-1 &quot;t-    1	4- 2Alcoholic drink	827	838	849	880	903	-r 4	H- 3Tobacco......	782	794	811	831	835	-1- 2	 Housing, fuel and light...	1,119	1,145	1,193	1,186	1,200	- 1	t-   1Durable household goods	548	624	714	763	717	4- 7	- 6Clothing and footwear...	892	912	977	1,030	1,050	+ 5	j- ?Other goods	590	638	685	712	725	-t- 4	4- 2Private   motoring   and							cycling (J)	208	272	328	416	380	-f-27	- miscellaneous services ...	1,343	1,353	1,375	1,374	1,370	 	 Total   ......	8,730	9,085	9,531	9,819	9,825	-1- 3	-(&apos;) Net expenditure on new and second-hand vehicles and running costs.26. Hire purchase sales appear to have fallen more heavily than cashsales, and this suggests that the restrictions on hire purchase were a particu-larly important factor in restricting demand for the goods affected. Theresult was a fall in hire purchase debt over the year of  90 million, which by reducing consumers&apos; indebtedness made a substantial contribution tothe high level of personal savings in 1956. A major reason for the contain-ment of consumers&apos; expenditure while incomes were rising, and thus forthe increase in saving, appears to have been the reduction in the oppor-tunities open to consumers to supplement their incomes by borrowing. this factor played a part not only in the reduction in expenditure on durablegoods but also in the reduced real expenditure on private housebuilding.The reduction in lending to the personal sector by banks, through hire purchase and by building societies-would together probably account for about half of the increase in personal saving.
27. Table 6 sets out the composition of food consumption in recent years.Expenditure on food increased by 5 per cent in 1956. Price rises accountedfor a 3 per cent rise, and the remaining increase was due mainly to a risein the standard of food consumption. More meat, fish, butter and sugarwere bought, partly as a result of increased home production. Potato con-sumption fell because of the poor crop. There was also a tendency through-out the year to buy less bread and slightly more biscuits and other cerealproducts. Within the food groups, too, the emphasis was on quality, lesseasy to measure. For instance, larger meat purchases included a higher proportion of fresh and chilled beef, home produced lamb and poultry ;and a larger proportion of home killed bacon pigs were of top quality.table 6:   food consumption in the united kingdom					1956	1952	1953	1954	1955	(pro-visional)Average daily consumption per head					Protein animal, grams......	42-9	44-0	46-3	47-4	48-2vegetable, grams	40-7	39-5	35-8	350	34-2total, grams       ......	83-6	83-5	82-1	82-4	82-4Fat (from all sources), grams	122-5	128-1	1360	137-1	137-9,, from butter, margarine, lard,					cooking fat and other edible oils					and fats (fat content), grams ...	56-2	56-9	60-6	601	60-5Total energy value (calories)	2,950	3,000	3,120	3,120	3,120Annual Consumption (lb. per head)					Dairy products (milk solids)	51 -5	52-3	52-5	52-2	53 0Meat (edible weight)        ......	84-6	93-4	104-3	110-4	112-5Poultry, game and fish (edible weight)	28-2	25-6	25-2	25-3	26-1Eggs and egg products (shell egg					equivalent)         .........	27-6	28-1	29-4	29-5	29-2Oils and fats (fat content)......	45-1	45-6	48-7	48-2	48-6Sugar and syrups (sugar content) ...	93-3	103-3	111-2	113-9	116-8Potatoes	237-8	222-4	221-9	223-3	212-6Pulses and nuts	9-4	10-6	12-2	11-5	11-8Fruit (fresh equivalent)	105-5	115-3	125-2	120 0	117-3Vegetables (fresh equivalent)	118-5	125-1	125-5	121-1	121-2Grain products      .........	219-5	208-4	202-1	196-4	193 0Tea   ...............	8-5	9-5	9-7	9-4	101Exports28. To the four domestic claimants on resources fixed investment, stocks,public authorities&apos; current expenditure and consumers&apos; expenditure must beadded the demand from overseas markets, which is reflected in our exports.Although our exports expanded in 1956 and took an increasing share ofindustrial production, they did not fully keep pace with the rapid growth of world demand, and there was a further slight fall in the United Kingdom&apos;s share of world trade in manufactures. Nevertheless, the underlying trend of United Kingdom exports improved in 1956. The value of total exportsas recorded in the Trade Accounts was  3,172 million, an increase of  267million (or a little over 9 per cent) over 1955 ; in 1955 the increase onthe previous year -had been  231 million (or about 8^ per cent).29. The 1956 figures included  22 million worth of silver bullion sentto the United States in repayment of lend-lease borrowing. On the otherhand, the 1955 figures were inflated to some extent by shipments which hadbeen delayed by the dock strike of October, 1954. Allowing for these two factors, the underlying increase in volume in 1956 was a full 6 per cent,13
compared with about 4  per cent in 1955. Export prices in 1956 were about  per cent higher than in 1955. The underlying increase in value in 1956 wastherefore not far short of 10 per cent, compared with an underlying increasein 1955 of about 5^ per cent.30. World demand increased in 1956 for all the main classes of manu-factures but, as in 1955, it was particularly strong for metals and engineeringgoods. It was in this group of products that our exports expanded most strongly, although durable consumer goods did not for the most part share in this increase. Most of the increase was in capital goods and in non-ferrous metals (39 per cent higher than in 1955, partly as a result of sharpincreases in metal prices).31. Details of the commodity composition of our exports are given inTable 7. There was a very marked expansion in exports of ships, andof aircraft and engines ; in the case of ships in particular there appears tohave been an unusual concentration of deliveries in 1956, reflecting a high level of export orders several years previously. There was also a substantial increase in exports of most kinds of machinery and of miscellaneous metalmanufactures (apart from arms and ammunition). Exports of road vehicles were much the same as in 1955, an increase in exports of commercial vehicles and chassis being offset by a fall in exports of passenger car sand chassis.32. There was some increase in exports of all the other main commoditygroups except textiles (where a slight increase in shipments of wool textilestable 7:   exports and re-exports	1952	1953	1954	1955	1956Value of Exports (  million)					Iron and steel       ...      ......	131	135	137	156	173Non-ferrous base metals ...	52	60	56	74	103Road vehicles and parts (&apos;)	278	248	276	298	301Aircraft and engines       ......	44	63	52	62	100Ships and boats    .........	36	40	51	54	94Machinery and electrical goods (&apos;) Arms and ammunition (2)......	573	551	559	629	693	23	44	47	57	47Other engineering products       ......	175	172	175	184	202Total Metals and Engineering Products	1,311	1,313	1,353	1,515	1,712Chemicals  ...      ......	184	178	204	233	245Textiles (excluding clothing)	335	325	325	311	295Other manufactures (3)	312	282	290	329	369Food, beverages and tobacco    ......	155	150	158	172	183Coal, coke, etc..........	66	71	68	64	62Petroleum  ......      ......      ...	60	77	84	78	99Basic materials     .........	82	97	101	111	116Other exports       .........	80	89	91	93	91Total Exports       ............	2,585	2,582	2,674	2,905	3,172Re-Exports.........      ...	144	105	101	119	146Total value of exports and re-exports as recorded in the trade accounts   ...

was more than offset by the drop in shipments of cotton and synthetictextiles) and coal. Exports of petroleum and petroleum products increasedby 28 per cent; there were smaller increases in chemicals, miscellaneousmanufactures, basic materials, and food and beverages.Production33. Between 1955 and 1956 the gross domestic product rose by just under one per cent, the smallest increase since 1952. A large part of this increase came from increased output by the distributive and service trades and from higher agricultural output. Industrial production expanded only very slightly.   After rising to a record level in the fourth quarter of 1955,OUTPUT, IMPORTS AND EXPORTS(VOLUME  1352 - 100)IMPORTSit fell back at the beginning of 1956 to the level it had reached in thesecond and third quarters of 1955, and, if allowance is made for seasonalfactors, remained more or less stable through the whole of 1956. But, aswill be seen from Table 8, within this stability there were widely divergentmovements in different industries. The increase in rates of purchase taxin the autumn Budget of 1955 and the increase in minimum hire purchasedeposits for many consumer goods in February 1956 led to a heavy fallin the demand for motor cars and other durable consumer goods, and witha reduced demand from some overseas markets, particularly Australia,production of these goods fell well below 1955 levels. Output of commercial vehicles continued to rise in the first half of the year, but subsequentlyfell off. At the end of the year the oil shortage led to a further heavy fallin the demand for motor vehicles. The output of durable metal household goods also fell; on the other hand, there was a continued and encouraging

increase in the production of engineering capital goods and aircraft. defence production by the metal-using industries accounted for one-eighth of theoutput of those industries in both 1955 and 1956. In the latter year howeverthere was a slight fall in both total production and defence output.34. Output of other industries continued to rise, but generally at a ratherslower rate. The only two industrial groups to show a greater rate of expan-sion than between 1954 and 1955 were textiles and clothing, and food, drinkand tobacco. The slower rate of expansion of the metal manufacturing industries is partly explained by an industrial dispute in the steel industry,which cost about half a million tons of steel. Sheet steel became more readily available during the year, but there was a growing shortage of steel plates and sections. The output of the building and contracting industry rose sub-stantially. Output of coal was at about the same level as in 1955. Develop-ments in particular industries and in agriculture are described in the Appendix.Imports35. The levelling off of industrial production and of consumers&apos; expenditurein 1956 was reflected in a stable level of imports : the volume of importsfell very slightly, although higher import prices brought the value of imports to  3,889 million, a fraction above the 1955 level. In 1955 imports hadexpanded sharply, and a substantial part of the increase was needed tomeet the demands of the rapidly expanding metal-using industries. Withthe check to the expansion of these industries at the beginning of 1956,their import demands also fell, though imports of steel continued at a high level up to April, probably because contracts had been entered into beforethe fall in demand. Higher steel production, on the other hand, brought a continued substantial rise in imports of steel-making materials throughoutthe year. Imports of other raw materials either fell slightly or showed a smaller increase than in 1955. Arrivals of timber, non-ferrous metals and chemicals were all lower than in 1955, and the quantity of rubber imports was also unchanged, despite a big increase in the supplies required forre-export, principally to the Soviet Union.

expenditure in 1956, plus increased home production of food, meant thatthere was no further appreciable increase in imports of food, drink and feed-ing stuffs, such as had occurred in 1955. Coal imports fell back from theirhigh 1955 level, but oil imports continued to rise, partly because of continuedindustrial conversions from coal to oil, until the Suez Canal and iraq petroleum Company pipeline were closed.Employment36. The three years preceding 1956 were marked by an expanding working population, an increasing demand for labour, and very low and decliningunemployment. In 1956, however, there was some slackening in the demandfor labour. The working population was very little bigger at the end of theyear than at the beginning, the numbers in civil employment fell slightly,and there was a drop in unfilled vacancies. This was accompanied by somerise in unemployment and short-time working and some falling off inovertime.37. In 1956 there was a rise of 96,000 in the number of wholly unemployed.The number of women in civil employment fell by 70,000, and the numbers inthe Forces by 18,000. The main change within civil employmentwas a fall of 125,000 in the manufacturing industries. This resulted from a decline in employment in industries producing consumer goods, particularly motor vehicles and accessories, wireless apparatus, cotton,rubber, furniture and china. There were, however, small offsetting increases in employment in some important capital goods and export industries,particularly chemicals, iron and steel manufacture, ship-building, engineering,electrical machinery and aircraft manufacture. Outside manufacturing therewas a fall in agriculture, but transport, and the coal, distribution and buildingindustries all increased their labour force.38. Unfilled vacancies fell from 382,000 in December, 1955, to 279,000 inDecember, 1956, when for the first time since March, 1954, they were fewer than the number of unemployed. The easing in the demand for labour was general throughout industry, but was largely confined to semi-skilled andunskilled workers. The Notification of Vacancies Order was revoked in May,but there was no noticeable effect on the number of vacancies reported to employment exchanges.39. The average level of unemployment during the year was 257,000,25,000 more than in 1955, but still lower than in any other postwar yearexcept 1951. The highest monthly total during the year, 297,000 in December,represented 1-4 per cent of all employees, compared with 1-0 per cent twelvemonths previously. The increase of 81,000 during the period consisted of62,000 wholly unemployed, spread over all industry groups, and 19,000temporarily stopped, almost all of whom were in vehicle manufacture. the regions in which unemployment increased most were London and SouthEastern and Midlands.40. The number working short-time in manufacturing industries, 34,000 inNovember, 1955, increased in the first half of 1956. There was a fall laterfrom 112,000 in August to 73,000 in November but a rise again at the endof 1956 to about 150,000. The main increase both in the first part of the yearand in December was in the motor vehicle and accessories industries. Therewas a marked improvement during the year in the cotton industry.41. Overtime working in manufacturing industry showed the same effectsas short-time working. The numbers on overtime fell from 1,815,000 inNovember, 1955, to 1,375,000 in August, 1956, and then rose to 1,603,000
in November, 1956. The proportion of operatives on short-time in November,1956, was li per cent, and on overtime 27 per cent.42. The Government has been giving particular attention to the problem ofthe shortage of scientists and technologists, a section of our manpower whichis small in number, but of vital importance to our economy. During the yearplans were announced for a very large expansion, both in the universities andin the technical colleges, of the numbers of students in science and technology.The current shortage is to some extent due to the heavy demands which havebeen made for scientists and technologists for defence research and develop-ment work, which has accounted for an increasing proportion of the defence effort. At the beginning of 1956 about a half of all those engaged on scientific research in manufacturing industry were employed in the two industries aircraft, and electrical engineering (of which electronics forms a part) inwhich defence research has been particularly Concentrated.table 10:   distribution of manpower in great britainThousands	End-		End-	Change		December,	Mid-1956	December,	during		1955		1956	year	Total working population......	24,073	24,107	24,087	4   14	H.M.

Costs and prices43. The economic measures taken by the Government during 1955 to achieve the urgent and immediate objective of restraining excessive demandwere described in last year&apos;s Economic Survey. There remained&apos;, however,the more deep-rooted and intractable problem of rising costs and prices, andof halting the progressive fall in the value of money which has been going on without significant intermission ever since the war. Between 1947 and1955, the price of total final output rose by rather over 4 per cent and retail prices and the wage rate index both by about 5 per cent.44. In the early months of 1956 the upward movement of prices and wagescontinued. At the end of March the wage rate index, at 162 (June, 1947- 100), was 5 per cent higher than at the end of December, although there-after the rate of increase slowed down, while retail prices increased by about1\ per cent between mid-January and mid-April.45. A first step in a renewed attempt to deal with this problem was takenin March when the Government published a White Paper on &quot; The economic implications of Full Employment &quot;(*). The object was to create wider publicunderstanding of the causes of the continuing inflation of costs and prices.The White Paper showed that changes in indirect taxes and subsidies hadaccounted for only about one-seventh and higher import prices for only about one-fifth of the rise of 50 per cent in the price of total final output which tookplace between 1946 and 1955. About two-thirds of the increase, therefore,represented higher costs of production at home because incomes had risen(&apos;) Cmd. 9725.20;
faster than output. The White Paper emphasized that &quot; If the prosperouseconomic conditions necessary to maintain full employment are exploited by trade unions and business men, price stability and full employment becomeincompatible &quot;. Under such conditions, stability depended on the exercise of voluntary restraint in making wage claims and in fixing profit margins and prices.46. The Government followed up the publication of the White Paper by holding a series of meetings with representatives of employers and TradeUnions, at which problems of costs, wages and prices were discussed. Duringthe course of and after these meetings a number of practical contributions were made by representatives of industry, private and nationalized, towardsthe objective of steady prices over a substantial period. At the conclusionof these discussions the Government issued a statement calling upon allconcerned for a continuing effort to keep prices, costs and wages steady.47. Between mid-January and mid-December 1956 the retail prices indexrose 3^ per cent compared with a rise of 5% per cent in the same periodof 1955, as is shown in Table 11. The difference in the way prices have moved in the two years is even more striking if the period since the endof the spring is taken. Between April and December the retail price indexrose only \ per cent compared with a rise of nearly 5 per cent duringthe same period of 1955. To an important extent the relative stability of the retail prices index during 1956 has been due to the comparativesteadiness of food prices. Although the food index rose 6 per cent by April(due to exceptionally high vegetable prices) it subsequently fell, so that between January and December it had risen by under per cent comparedwith a rise of over 6\ per cent in the same period of 1955. The relativestabilisation of prices taken as a whole was achieved in spite of a reductionin the subsidy on milk and the removal of the bread subsidy, the increases in tobacco and petrol taxes, and increased charges for national health serviceprescriptions. These measures, taken by themselves, would probably have raised the index of retail prices by about \\ per cent.table 11 :   changes in the index of retail pricesPer cent	January,  1955 to December,  1955		January,  1956 to December, 1956		Change in average prices	Effect on all items index	Change in average prices	Effect on all items indexFood   ..................

48. Up to the end of 1956 retail prices had been little affected by the suez crisis. The increase in the tax on petrol and oil was sufficient toraise the retail prices index by about one-fifth of a point on account ofprivate motoring ; the higher bus fares permitted by the Hydrocarbon OilDuties Aot did not affect the index until early in 1957. But although freight rates rose and also some commodity prices, retail prices of food had shown noeffects of these increased costs up to mid-December.49. Information on the movement of costs during 1956 is more scantyand more difficult to interpret. The main indicators are set out in Table 12.It will be seen that average annual earnings in manufacturing industryincreased by 8 per cent, fully as much as in 1955. This was the resultof the increases in money wage rates referred to above which were negotiatedduring the winter of 1954/55. Output per man year, having increasedless in 1955 than in 1954, actually fell in 1956. The result of these twomovements was a substantial increase in labour costs per unit of output.Since the prices of basic industrial materials and fuel also rose, there musthave been a considerable rise in total costs of production.table 12:   indicators of costs and prices in manufacturing industries^)Percentage changes	1952 to 1953	1953 to 1954	1954 to 1955	1955 to 1956Labour costs Output per man-year       ...      ......

This rise does not seem to have been reflected fully in factory prices.Between 1955 and 1956 the average of wholesale prices for manufacturedgoods (excluding fuel, food and tobacco) rose by only 4J per cent. the implication is that profit margins were on average reduced.51. This development is not surprising. Average output per man fellduring 1956 because the fall in demand and output in a number of industrieswas not matched by proportionate reductions in their labour forces. Over-head costs must also have risen in these industries. In many cases, manu-facturers appear to have preferred to retain their workers, employing themless fully, presumably in the expectation of a fairly early resurgence of demand. Such a recovery of output would be matched by a parallelrecovery in output per man and a fall in labour and overhead costs. Wherecosts rise because of a fall in demand which is likely to be temporary itmight be expected that since the higher costs are also temporary they will be absorbed rather than passed on.
MOVEMENT OF PRICESJan. 1952 . 100Financial and monetary developments52. Estimates relating to the financial position of industrial and tradingcompanies are set out in Table 13. In contrast to previous years, tradingprofits rose very little in 1956: the estimate given is of a rise of some 30 million, or 1 per cent. This was supplemented by an increase of about 50 million in income from other sources, bringing the increase in totalcompany income to nearly  80 million. However, tax payments, which relateto the profits made in earlier periods, also rose by nearly  80 million. Sincedividend payments rose by  70 million, undistributed profits remaining were some  70 million lower than in the previous year.53. The value of fixed investment at home carried out by companies con-tinued to increase in 1956, though at a slower rate than in 1955: by 135 million against an increase of  210 million in the previous year. Atthe same time a smaller provision was made for increased value of companies&apos;stocks than in ithe previous year. These two kinds of investment together in 1956 amounted to about  100 million less than in 1955. Companies&apos;borrowing by new public issues declined by about  50 million. The generalpicture of company finance in 1956 is of profits squeezed and the rate ofcapital expenditure moderating.54. The Governmenfs surplus on revenue account fell by  200 millionbetween 1955 and 1956. Revenue rose a good deal less than in the previous year, partly because the economy expanded more slowly; but expenditure rosea good deal more than in 1955. The account is set out in Table 14. Taxeson income yielded only  40 million more than in 1955&apos;; receipts were loweredby the continuing effect of the reduction of the standard rate in 1955. Death

The balancing item represents net investment overseas,net capital transfers received (E.P.T. refunds and war damage compensation), and netacquisition of financial assets (other than those specified in the table).55. The capital account of the Central Government is presented in Table 15.On the income side, total receipts were  205 million below those of 1955,an amount almost equal to the fall in the current surplus. The main corre-sponding change on the side of expenditure was in respect of loans to localauthorities, who succeeded so well in borrowing from the market and other sources that they took only  90 million from the Exchequer, against  407million in 1955. Other investment of various kinds made heavier calls on government finance. Fixed investment carried out by the Government itselfrose ;  77 million less was obtained from the disposal of stocks; and  128million  more was  advanced to public corporations than  in  1955, induties yielded about  20 million less, and taxes on expenditure  80 million more. Total tax receipts rose by only  100 million, compared with1 anincrease of  300 million in 1955. National insurance contributions and benefits rose further in 1956 following the introduction of higher rates1 in thecourse of 1955. Government expenditure, excluding these benefits, increasedby  307 million, or 7 per cent. Rather over  200 million of this increase was on goods and services. The service of the National Debt cost  33 million more ; grants to local authorities, chiefly for education,  46 million more.table 13:   company finance and investment^)

Table 16 shows the current and capital account of local authorities inthe four years 1953-56. Current revenue and expenditure both rose by about 140 million between 1955 and 1956 and the current surplus remainedvirtually unchanged at  102 million. Thus the sharp increase in rates wastotally absorbed in increased expenditure on goods and services. On thecapital side, there was a remarkable reduction in borrowing in 1956 fromthe Central Government, and a corresponding increase of  331 million inother net borrowing. This switch was in accordance with Government policyintroduced at the end of October, 1955, that local authorities should thereafterborrow as much as possible from, market sources rather than the PublicWorks Loans Board. New issues of stock, which are included in &quot; otherborrowing &quot; in Table 16, rose from  9 million in 1955 to  57 million in 1956.57. In 1956 the monetary restraints which had been introduced during theprevious year were strengthened and throughout the year credit conditionsremained in general restrictive. Interest rates rose. In February Bank rate was raised from a\ per cent to 5-^ per cent and discount rates on treasury and commercial bills rose rather more than 1 per cent. Long-term interest rates had been rising before the increase in Bank Rate ; following that
-    102increase and the statement made by the Chancellor on 17th February of measures to deal with the economic situation, these rates became more steadyaround the level to which they had by then risen, and the market for gilt-edged securities became more active. The sharp rise in short-term ratesbrought them above the level of long-term rates. After February discountrates tended to fall slightly, though with periods of renewed increase, and atthe close of the year the fall became more marked. On the other hand,from about mid-year, medium and long-term interest rates began to risefurther and reached their highest point in November. Thus, at the turn ofthe year the whole structure of interest rates was falling. Rates in the moneymarket were falling more than those in the Gilt-edged market, though activitythroughout the latter was rising considerably, but at no point in the structuredid the fall wholly reverse the rise that had occurred earlier in 1956. Overthe year as a whole, discount rates and medium-term interest rates rose byabout f- per cent; and long-term rates by \ per cent. The prices of ordinary shares dropped sharply early in the year ; they made some recovery later butthe fall was about 1 per cent over the year as a whole, with a rise in thedividend yield on ordinary shares approaching 1 per cent.table 15:   capital account of central government  million	1952	1953	1954	1955	1956Sources of finance:					Surplus from revenue account(&apos;)......	386	231	279	513	322Capital transfers from abroad  ...	35	27	11	18	10Borrowing from overseas governments ...	26	 .

There was a small rise an the net deposits of the Clearing Banks.Table 17 shows the main changes in the deposits and principal assets of theLondon Clearing Banks in 1956. Net deposits rose by  43 million, following on the sharp fall of  297 million in the previous year.  There was little net
change in the Clearing Banks&apos; holdings of Treasury Bills, money at calland cash. The main increase was in Advances and Other Accounts, whichrose by  61 million. This increase was, however, more than accounted forby advances to the nationalised industries (excluding the National coal board) which rose by  79 million from  30 million at the end of 1955 totable 16:   current and capital account of local authorities  million	1952	1953	1954	1955	1956Current Account					Revenue:					Rates     ......      .........	393	435	460	476	545Current grants from the Central Govern-					ment   ...............	369	399	427	469	515Other income    ............	169	197	221	244	267Total     .........	931	1,031	1,108	1,189	1,327Expenditure:					Current expenditure on goods and ser-					vices   ............	684	733	784	838	950Housing subsidies       ......	18	19	20	21	22Current grants to persons     ......	48	49	55	71	80Debt interest    .........	98	118	137	155	173Total current expenditure	848	919	996	1,085	1,225Current surplus    .........	83	112	112	104	102Total     .........	931	1,031	1,108	1,189	1,327Capital Account					Gross fixed capital formation......	539	603	573	540	555Financed by:					Current surplus.........	83	112	112	104	102Capital grants from the Central Govern-					ment   ............	16	23	25	15	18Net   borrowing   from   the   Central					Government.........	402	322	256	407	90Other borrowing (net)......	38	146	180	14	345table 17:   deposits and assets of london clearing banks  million	Net deposits	Cash and money at call	Treasury bills	Com-mercial bills	Invest-ments	Advances and other accounts31 Dec. 1953 31 Dec. 1954 31 Dec. 1955 31 Dec. 1956	6,370 6,558 6,261 6,305	1,043 1,069 1,071 1,076	1,338 1,199 1,271 1,275	79 114 129 140	2,275 2,353 2,016 1,980	1,707 1,897 1,851 1,913Change in: Year 1954 Year 1955 Year 1956	4 188 - 297 4   43	+   26 +    2 +    5	- 139 4-   72 4-    4	4   35 4   15 4   11	4-   78 - 337 - 36	4- 190 -   46 4-   611st Qr. 1956     ... 2nd Qr. 1956   ... 3rd Qr. 1956    ... 4th Qr. 1956    ...	- 433 4 143 4   71 + 263	- 127 4-   20 - 45 4 157	- 325 4-   85 4- 261 - 17	- 6 - 9 - 11 4   37	- 23 - 30 - 16 4-   33	4-   53 4-   70 - 115 4-   53
 109 million at the end of 1956*. There were also increases in lending toengineering, iron and steel and allied trades and greater provision of mediurn-term credit for exports. On the other hand there was a substantial fall,greater than in 1955, in personal and professional advances. Retail trade,food industries, hire purchase finance companies, agriculture and fishing,, andlocal government authorities also reduced their bank borrowing.59. The following paragraphs outline the development of the bankingposition in the course of 1956. In the first quarter of the year the net inflowof revenue to the Exchequer was again substantial and increased activity inmarkets for gilt-edged securities enabled governmental finance also to beraised from the issue and sales of securities. There was a large reductionin Treasury Bills outstanding in the market, both with Clearing Banks andother holders. The liquid assets of the Clearing Banks were reduced by 458 million. A rise in their advances and other accounts of  53 million,as compared with a rise of  127 million in the same quarter of 1955, was partly offset by a further fall in their investments. Net deposits fell by 433 million, slightly more than in the same months of 1955 and much morethan in earlier years. The liquidity ratio was reduced from 344 per cent at the end of December, 1955, to 331 per cent in March.60. After April the liquid assets of the Clearing Banks began again torise, at first largely due to the Budget deficit that normally prevails from march until the end of the year and to the financing of an increase in the external reserves. The maturity in August of  824 million of national war Bonds, of which  658 million were converted into a new stock, addedto the Exchequers financial requirements. From March to September the clearing Banks&apos; liquid assets rose by  301 million and this was accompaniedby a net fall in their other assets of nearly  90 million, so that net depositsincreased by  214 million and the liquidity ratio rose to nearly 37 per cent.Within this period, the advances and other accounts of the Clearing Banksrose until mid-year and then fell by a greater amount. Changes of this nature are normal, but in 1956 the smallness of the increase and the size ofthe fall reflected the continuing pressure exercised by the banks to restrainadvances. In July the Chancellor met representatives of the various bankingassociations and asked that there should be no relaxation in the criticalattitude towards applications for bank finance.61. In the last quarter of the year there were conflicting movements. Onthe one hand, the Budget deficit was rising, seasonally but quite sharply. Onthe other hand, receipts by the Exchequer from National Savings and fromTax Reserve Certificates grew considerably and so also, though subject tosome intermissions, did receipts from official sales of securities. In addition,large sterling receipts accrued! as a result of the fall in external reserves.The Floating Debt assets of the Clearing Banks that is their holdings of treasury Bills and their money at call to the discount market rose in thefourth quarter. But this did not reflect a corresponding increase in the floating Debt held by the market as a whole; the immediate cause was a sharp decrease in the total of Treasury Bills held outside government depart-ments and outside the Clearing Banks and the discount market. In Decemberthe Clearing Banks&apos; holdings of commercial bills, which had declined sinceearly in the year, also rose. Their liquid assets, as a whole, thus rose by 177 million over the quarter.  The downward movement in their investments,* Under the Finance Act, 1956, the capital needs of these bodies are being met, for thetime being, by advances from the Exchequer. There has been a gradual reduction in theirbank overdrafts beginning with the first Exchequer advances in 1956, and extending into1957. After this process of repayment is concluded, the industries would look to the banksonly for their normal short-term needs.
(4) OVERSEAS TRADE AND payments the trade balance62. The stability in imports, and the marked rise in exports recorded inthe previous chapter, brought about a reduction of nearly a third in thetrade deficit in 1956 as compared with 1955. Ini 1955 the excess of imports(c.i.f.) over exports and re-exports (f.o.b.) amounted to  859 million on a trade accounts basis ; in 1956 to  571 million. The improvement in thetrade balance was mainly due to changes in volume; but it was assisted by some improvement in the terms of trade. Import prices declined inthe middle of the year but rose in the last few months (partly as a resultof higher freight rates) and for the year as a whole they were 2 per cent higher in 1956 than in 1955 ; but export prices which were very stable from mid-195 3 to the end of 1954 have followed an upward course at the rateof one point a quarter since early 1955 ; and in 1956 as a whole they were about 4 per cent higher than in 1955. On average the terms of trade were about 2 per cent better than in 1955.63. There were comparatively small changes in the geographical distribu-tion of imports in 1956. There was a slight increase in imports from thenon-sterling world as a whole; but it was very much smaller than in theprevious year. Imports from the dollar area rose by only a little under 1^per cent compared with a rise of 36 per cent in 1955 ; from O.E.E.C.countries by under 2 per cent as compared with 17 per cent; and fromother non-sterling countries by about 6 per cent as compared with 18 per cent.At the same time imports from the rest of the sterling area fell in&apos; 1956 byabout 3% per cent.64. The direction of United Kingdom exports is shown in Table 18.In 1956, as in 1955, North America and Western Europe were the mostrapidly growing of the main markets. Our export performance in NorthAmerioa was much better than in 1955 ; United Kingdom exports increasedby as much as 23 per cent (excluding the special item of silver), after anincrease of only 10 per cent in 1955. Our exports to Western european countries (which account for about a quarter of our total exports) alsoimproved, but less strikingly; they rose by 11 per cent, as against anincrease of 5J per cent in 1955. Shipments to both France and germany were, however, over 20 per cent higher than in 1955. Our exports to other non-sterling countries expanded1 vigorously. They increased1 by 12J percent, after an increase of 1\ per cent in 1955 ; this was largely due to higherexports to Indonesia, Finland and Spain. In total, our exports to non-sterling markets (a little over half of our total export trade) increased by15-J per cent, after an increase of 10 per cent in 1955.65. By contrast, the value of our exports to the sterling area was verylittle higher than in 1955, despite a very sharp increase (29 per cent) toIndia. There is some evidence that we lost ground to our competitors insome parts of the sterling area, but the main reason for the small increase was the contraction of the Australian and New Zealand markets because of import restrictions.which had prevailed since the close of 1954, was halted; investments rose by 33 million. At the same time their advances and other accounts rose  53million, mainly in December when a seasonal rise in &quot; Other Accounts&quot; isusual. Net deposits thus rose by  263 million and the liquidity ratio rose to37-4 per cent, the same level as in December, 1955.

The improvement in the balance of visible payments was the out-standing feature in the United Kingdom current balance of external paymentsbetween 1955 and 1956. On the basis used in making balance of paymentsestimates (see footnote to table 19) United Kingdom exports of goods roseby about 10 per cent while imports were less than 1 per cent higher. (this change is very little different from that on the Trade Accounts basis.) Asa result the visible deficit in balance of payments terms fell from  366 million in 1955 to  72 million in 1956.67. Changes in the other parts of the current account virtually cancelledeach other out, so that in 1956 the invisible surplus (including defence aid)at  278 million was about the same as in 1955. Within this unchangedinvisible surplus however, there were certain important changes in individualitems. The improvement in net earnings from interest, profits and dividendsbetween the years reflects the fact that annual interest charges on the north american loans in 1956 iwere paid into a special account and not entered intocurrent debits. In the first half year the net credit from oil was higher thanin either half of 1955, but there was some fall in the net credit in the second half year owing to the interruptions of Middle East supplies, and over 1956as a whole net receipts were about the same as in the previous year. Defenceaid receipts continued to fall; but receipts from other kinds of american military expenditure in this country were higher than in the previous year.68. These factors produced a surplus on current account (including Defenceaid) of  206 million in 1956, as compared with a deficit of  89 million in1955. The distribution of this improvement by areas largely followed the pattern of visible trade. The surplus with the rest of the sterling area at 269 million was  52 million larger than in 1955 The deficit with thenon-sterling area was  63 million, an improvement of  245 million.

First there are differences of coverage. Landings byBritish Whale Fisheries and trade with the Channel Islands are excluded, whereas imports and exports of diamonds and all second-hand ships are included. These differences increasethe trade account figures for imports by   million and   million, and for exports by  million and   million in 1955 and 1956 respectively. Secondly there are differences of valuation and timing, arising from the fact that the figures in this table represent earnings and expenditure, whereas the trade accounts record departures and arrivals. Charges for insurance and freight are in general here excluded from the value of imports; these differences,timing and other factors which cannot be separately evaluated decrease the trade accountfigures of imports by   million in 1955 and   million in 1956. Timing and otherdifferences decrease the trade account figure for exports by   million in 1955 and  million in 1956.The capital accountLong-term investment and the commercial position69. The progress of the current balance from year to year describes onlyone part of the country&apos;s overseas trade and commerce. Besides being oneof the world&apos;s greatest trading nations, the United Kingdom normally investslarge sums abroad each year and overseas countries invest here in the same
way-the net outflow being probably second only to that of the UnitedStates. Such flows of long-term capital whether they be on government account (such as the repayment of the United States and Canadian loans)or normal private investment are as much a part of what might briefly becalled our &quot; commercial&quot; affairs as the payments and receipts for imports,exports, services, and property income which appear in the current account.To obtain a measure of the change in our commercial position the netoutflow on long-term capital account should therefore be reckoned in withthe current surplus^1)  This is done in Table 20 below.table 20:   the current and long-term investment account  million	1954	1955	1956 (provi-sional)	1955 Jan.-June	1955 July-Dec.	1956 Jan.-June	1956 July-Dec, (provi-sional)Current balance: (i) With rest of sterling area (ii) With non-sterling world...	4-273 - 63	4-219 -308	4-269 - 63	4-112 - 94	4-107 -214	4-112 4- 41	4-157 -104(iii) With all areas    ......	4-210	- 89	4-206	4- 18	-107	+ 153	4- 53Long-term investment transaction-tions(net): (outflow-) (i) With rest of sterling area (ii) With non-sterling world...	-190 - 30	-110 - 60	-140 - 50	- 60 - 20	- 50 - 40	- 40 - 30	-100 - 20(iii) With all areas   ......	-220	-170	-190	- 80	-   90	- 70	-120Balance of current transactions and long-term  invest-ment: (i) With rest of sterling area (ii) With non-sterling world	4- 83 - 93	4-109 -368	4-129 -113	4- 52 -114	4- 57 -254	4- 72 4- 11	4- 57 -124(iii) With all areas   ......	- 10	-259	4- 16	- 62	-197	4- 83	- 6770. It will be seen that over 1956 as a whole our commercial position wasin slight surplus (or rather, considering the magnitudes involved and the uncertainty of the investment estimate, in rough equilibrium): a great improve-ment on the unsatisfactory outcome of 1955. In other words, in 1956 ourcurrent surplus was just sufficient to offset our net long-term investmentoverseas, so that our &quot; monetary&quot; position was virtually unchanged. Itis only when there is a surplus on the combined current and long-term capital account that there is any improvement in the net monetary position,i.e., the balance of the remaining classes of overseas assets and liabilities,which are of a more short-term or monetary character. In 1955 neither objec-tive was attained, but in 1956 the first was: the commercial position wassound. The United Kingdom increased its long-term overseas assets by nearly 200 million during the year, almost the whole amount of the current surplus.But this left little over to improve the monetary position.(&apos;) The distinction drawn in this chapter between our &quot; commercial&quot; and &quot; monetary &quot;or &quot; banking &quot; positions is necessarily very imprecise. Some long-term investment, hereincluded in the &quot; commercial&quot; sector (e.g. some transactions in long-term securities), maybe in fact of an essentially short-term kind, and little different from movements in overseassterling holdings. Equally some changes in sterling balances are not really to be regardedas &quot; banking &quot; transactions, creating or extinguishing short-term monetary liabilities (e.g.the growth of official sinking funds invested in long-term Government securities). It must also be emphasised that these estimates of long-term investment are very uncertain.
71. During 1956, as in earlier years, ithe greater part of the net long-terminvestmenlt went Ito the rest of the sterling area. The net outflow Ito thenon-sterling world was little changed: the large credit item for the sale ofthe Trinidad Oil Company in September was in the event very nearly offset by an increase in non-sterling investment.The development of the international banking position72. Were the United Kingdom a country which was mot acting as aninternational banker the small improvement which took place in the monetary position in 1956 would have shown itself simply as an increase in externalreserves an increase in gold or dollar holdings. But this country is thecentre of a world-wide monetary nexus and sterling is a major internationalcurrency in which much of the world&apos;s trade is conducted. There is therefore a great mass of external liabilities and assets of a primarily monetarycharacter, and trends in their various components can be of die most crucial importance to our affairs. The big development which took place in this field in 1956 are therefore discussed in some detail below. The principalfigures are set out in Table 21.table 21:   overseas sterling holdings, reserves, etc.  million				1955		1956				1956					1954	1955	(provi-				July-			sional)	Jan-	July-	Jan-	Dec.

The rest of the sterling area73. Since the countries of the outer sterling area transact much the greaterpart of their external trade in sterling, any net balance of non-sterling curren-cies involved gravitates naturally, -through the foreign exchange markets, toLondon, leaving London to -settle with tham in sterling against any netsurplus or deficit of foreign currencies. Similarly their gold exports (whichare treated in our balance of payments accounts separately from normalexports and are excluded from the current balance) are normally sold inLondon against sterling. It follows that changes in the sterling holdings ofthese countries reflect their commercial position very closely.74. Moreover, since the outer sterling area, taken as a whole, is nominallyin deficit with -the United Kingdom on current and long-term capital accountbut in surplus with the non-sterling world, its deficit with this country is met out of the sterling proceeds of its surplus with the rest of -the world. Ifits surplus- with the non-sterling world exceeds its deficit with the UnitedKingdom, its total sterling balances rise (and a net surplus of gold or foreign exchange will have accrued to the United Kingdom); if it is in deficit, its total sterling balances fall.75. During 1956 as in 1955 the non-sterling current and long-term capitalsurpluses of the countries of the rest of the sterling area appear very slightlyto have exceeded their deficit with this country. Taken as a whole they were approximately in balance, changing their aggregate sterling holdings by only small amounts. These changes were in both years slightly affected by miscel-laneous short-term capital movements, and there are some errors and omission-sions in our estimates, so that in 1956 balances fell  17 million comparedwith a fall of  45 million in 1955.76. It is only of course in a very limited sense that the overseas sterling area can be viewed collectively in this way. For in fact the area consists of many countries with widely disparate economies and institutions. the external economic circumstances of these countries over the last few years have differed markedly from each other, and the figures which result fromadding them together conceal many opposite movements within the group.The non-sterling world77. During the first half of 1956 -the United Kingdom had a small surpluson current -and long-term capital account with the non-sterling world. as this is the part of the year in which the exports of the rest of the sterling area to the non-sterling world are seasonally at their highest, London&apos;s net receipts from non-sterling countries were very high at some  124 million.The gold and dollar reserves rose sharply and there was a reduction of debt to the European -Payments Union. These -movements however did not whollyreflect the net non-sterling receipts, because simultaneously non-sterling countries ran down their sterling holdings.78. Thus, as in 1955, and as was to be the case still more in the lastmonths of 1956, reductions in -the sterling holdings of non-sterling countries were a major factor in the development of our international monetary situationand especially in determining the movement of the gold and dollar reserves.Before considering events in the latter half of 1956, it is therefore necessaryto explain, though in a simplified way, how such reductions come about and what their consequences to the reserves are.(i) A non-sterling country with which the sterling area is in surplus mayfinance its deficit by reducing its sterling holdings (if it has an excessavailable and does not acquire sterling from third countries) or by payingin gold or dollars.   The latter will be the necessary course if its sterling
-   11holdings are minimal. But the minimum level of working balances is anelastic concept and even if the country concerned does not normally holdmuch sterling and is not in a position to buy it from other non-sterling countries it is usually possible for some at least of the deficit to be financed from sterling holdings. This reduces the United KingdonTs sterling liabilities,just as the alternative of payment in gold or dollars increases the reserves.(ii) A country in the transferable account area, whether or not it be insurplus with the sterling area, may transfer sterling to settle a deficit withsome other transferable account country. Rather than accumulate moresterling than it wishes this country may in turn convert it into gold ordollars in one or other of ways mentioned below.(iii) Finally non-sterling countries holding sterling, taken as a whole,may desire to reduce their holdings for reasons which are not directly con-nected with trade, but are of a more essentially &quot; financial&quot; or &quot; banking &quot;kind. They may wish to move funds from London because, for example,interest rates elsewhere have been raised, or because they lack confidence in sterling. In the case of sterling held on American Account this reflectsimmediately upon the reserves, for such sterling is formally convertible.Sterling holdings (liabilities) are reduced and the gold and dollar reserves(assets) fall by the same amount. In practice much the same applies to sterling on transferable account though the detailed processes are different.In the case of E.P.U. countries the process is a little more com-complex since clearance through the Union involves only a 75 percent payment in gold or dollars for the reserves, the remaining25 per cent being added to the United kingdom&apos;s  debt to the Union andbecoming a different form of United Kingdom liability. Because of thetransferability of sterling among all non-dollar countries, reductions in the sterling holdings of non-dollar non-E.P.U. countries can equally affect the reserves if the sterling is transferred to E.P.U. countries. Moreover sales of sterling among transferable account countries against gold or dollars mayentail some effect upon our reserves and sterling liabilities if it becomesdesirable to intervene in the transferable market.79. Thus in general non-sterling countries are free to reduce their sterling holdings at will and these reductions are reflected, wholly in the UnitedKingdom&apos;s gold or dollar reserves or partly in the reserves and partly inour debtor position in E.P.U. But such reductions, though they reduceexternal assets reduce external liabilities too. They therefore leave the netmonetary position, as defined in para. 70, unchanged. It does not of coursefollow that they can be a matter of indifference to us, for reserves are needednot only to back monetary liabilities but also to finance any deficit whichmay arise in the commercial position of the sterling area, and therefore theirabsolute level is of great importance. Nevertheless reserve losses due to&quot; monetary &quot; reasons of this kind are in a different category from those dueto &quot; commercial&quot; weakness, and the two need to be distinguished if theprogress of our affairs is to be understood.80. In the second half of 1956 there was a large current deficit in theUnited Kingdom&apos;s balance of payments with the non-sterling world, a smallnet long-term capital outflow, and a very sharp reduction, as compared withthe preceding six months, in non-sterling receipts from the rest of the sterling area (largely for seasonal reasons). These items together showed a deficit of some  100 million. In normal circumstances therefore a substantial fallin reserves was to be expected, accompanied perhaps by some increase inthe sterling holdings of non-sterling countries. But at the same time therewas a very severe weakening of confidence in sterling arising out of the Middle
East crisis. This had two consequences. In the first place, the sterling holdings of non-sterling countries, so far from rising, were abruptly reducedby a large amount. Secondly, there were net outward movements of miscellaneous short-term capital and there appear also to have been changesin the normal pattern of timing for overseas transactions. These latter cannotbe precisely measured or even identified, but they were probably an important factor in the swing from surplus to deficit in errors and omissions comprised in line 9 of Table 21. Such &quot; leads and lags &quot; imply an immediate reductionin the reserves no less than the withdrawal of the sterling holdings. However,the timing and methods of financing payments tend to be restored to normalwhen confidence returns; abnormally high payments and low receipts arelater balanced by abnormally high receipts and abnormally low payments.To this extent the immediate loss of reserves is equivalent to a short-term capital movement which is later reversed.GOLD AND DOLLAR RESERVESU.S. $ million U.S. $ milliont      &apos;   I   .   i &apos; i   1   .  i   .

For these reasons the quite moderate losses to the reserves which wereto be expected on commercial account (and which represented a genuine iflargely seasonal deterioration of the net monetary position) were in the lastmonths of 1956 greatly exaggerated by a weakness in confidence. This riskedbringing reserves to so low a point as to provoke yet further confidencelosses. It became imperative to demonstrate the Governments determination and ability to defend sterling. Above all the reserves had to be rapidlyreinforced. In December steps were therefore taken to draw  200 million of dolars from the United Kingdom&apos;s quota in the International monetary fund, to mobilise a further standby credit from the Fund and to arrange
a line of credit from the United States Export-Import Bank. The I.M.F.drawing (which brought the reserves at the end of the year a little abovetheir level at the end of 1955) and the possibility thus demonstrated ofobtaining, if necessary, yet greater dollar reinforcements totalling in all  440million, proved effective in ending speculation. An application was also made to the United States and Canadian Governments for a waiver of theinterest due at the end of the year on the post-war loans, the  37 million of dollars in question being placed meanwhile in special accounts.Summing up the balance of payments82. Summing up, the position on current and investment account the commercial position improved very considerably in 1956, from a deficit of some  260 million in 1955 to a small surplus. The greater partof this improvement was due to the improvement in this country&apos;s current balance with the non-sterling world. This improved commercial positionin 1956 was however accompanied by big changes in the composition of monetary assets and liabilities, above all with respect to non-sterling countries.Primarily because of a temporary break in confidence in the later monthsof the year, there were large reductions of sterling holdings by these countries and a considerable outflow of miscellaneous capital. Consequently a draw-ing on the I.M.F. was required to maintain the reserves. The year endedwith slightly higher gold and dollar reserves and little change in the liabilitiesto the sterling area, but with very much reduced liabilities to non-sterling countries. There is now a liability to repay the I.M.F., but on the otherhand large second-line reserves have been mobilised.(5) GENERAL ASSESSMENT83. The economic policy followed during 1956 was one of disinflation,designed to encourage exports, check imports and stabilise prices. It wasalso the Governments desire to place the main burden of restraint on con-sumption rather than investment. On the whole this policy was successful;but the difficulties in the Middle East, while they had produced no wide-spread effects on trade or production as a whole by the end of the year,did cause a severe strain on the external banking position.84. The main features of the economy in 1956 were the progressive checkto consumption, and the fact that exports expanded more than internaldemand, while imports remained stable. Expenditure on cars and durablehousehold goods fell sharply, while other types of consumers&apos; expenditurerose slightly. The check to consumer spending was mainly the result ofGovernment policy in raising indirect taxes and curtailing hire purchasefacilities and bank advances, though people may also have been disposed to save more after the heavy buying of cars in the previous year. TheBudget contained important measures to foster savings, and the incentivesgiven appear to have met with a good response.85. The investment boom continued in 1956 but the rate of expansionslowed down. As in 1955, the pattern of investment shifted away fromhousing to industrial development. Stocks were again built up in 1956 butat a slower rate than in 1955. Government expenditure increased slightly in real terms, partly because of the Suez crisis. Exports rose at a ratherfaster rate than in the previous year, and showed a greater expansion than any other sector of the economy.
86. The sum of these demands on the economy represented very littleincrease above the level of the previous year and called for little change inthe rate of home output and imports. Industrial production as a whole was barely above the 1955 level, because the fall in the production of car sand consumer durable goods practically offset the gains elsewhere. Thusby forgoing any increase in consumption and production and simul-taneously encouraging exports without increasing imports the nationsecured a substantial improvement in the current balance of pay-ments, converting the deficit of  89 million in 1955 into a surplus of  206million in 1956. Taking the current balance and long-term overseas invest-ment together there was an improvement from a deficit of  259 million toa surplus of  16 million.87. Restoration of the current balance of payments surplus without check-ing production could have been achieved only by an even better exportperformance. The important expansion in exports actually achieved con-sisted mainly of capital goods, for which home demand was also strong.The reduction in home demand on the motor and consumer goods industriesdid not lead to increases in their exports. Indirectly, however, the easing of consumer demand assisted the balance of payments in two ways by releas-ing labour and materials for export manufacture, and by helping to check the rising trend in imports.88. The reduction in the pressure of demand in 1956 alleviated the short-age of labour, which had become intense in 1955, but did not cause anyserious increase in unemployment. The easing in the labour market showedchiefly in the absence of growth in the labour force. There is likely tohave been a reduction in the number of married women at work. skilled workers on the whole remained scarce ; very few were released by the motorand other industries in which employment declined as employers tended todischarge only the semi-skilled and unskilled workers and to retain theirskilled workers on short-time. As a result of the redistribution of labourduring the year, most capital goods industries, the railways and the coalmines all gained small numbers of workers.89. The rising trend in wages and prices which had been very markedin 1955, remained a source of anxiety. A number of substantial wage increases occurred at the end of 1955 and in the first four months of 1956 ;mainly because of this the level of personal incomes in 1956 as a whole was1\ per cent and of prices 5 per cent above 1955. Profits rose very little in1956. From the spring of 1956, when the Government appealed to both sides of industry for stability, a plateau of prices was maintained for six months ;towards the end of the year the aftermath of the Suez crisis led to a furtherrise, but not of significant proportions. Wage settlements in the winter of1956-57 have so far shown markedly smaller increases than those of the two previous years, and should in turn exert less pressure on prices.90. The Suez crisis interrupted the improvement that was taking place inthe external financial position. During the first half of the year sterlingwas strong and Ithe reserves increased by July to  100 million above theirlevel at the beginning of the year. The nationalisation of the Suez Canalat ithe end of July led to considerable pressure on the reserves as a resultof adverse confidence movements. These movements became acute after theAnglo-French intervention ; during November the reserves fell by no lessthan  100 million, to stand at the end of the month at their lowest pointsince 1952.91. Urgent adtion was necessary to restore the position, and on 4thDecember the Government announced a number of measures.   To maintain
the revenue and restrain home demand the duty on petrol and diesel oilfor vehicles was increased. A large drawing was made on the United Kingdomquota with the International Monetary Fund; and further &quot; second linereserves &quot; were mobilised. The drain on the reserves was halted some days later, and the reserves at the end of the year stood a little above the level at the end of 1955.92. In the last two months of the year, the closing of the Suez Canalled to some delays in shipments, but the only commodity that became seriouslyshort was oil. Petrol rationing was introduced in the middle of december and supplies of diesel and fuel oil were cut; stocks were run down heavily.The only industry which was seriously affected by ithe oil shortage before theend of the year was the motor industry. Production of cars and commercial vehicles, which was already well below the 1955 level, fell still further and short-time working in the industry became fairly general.(6) THE PRESENT OUTLOOKThe outlook abroad93. The outlook for much of world trade is at the moment clouded bythe blocking of the Suez Canal. About one-eighth of the total tonnage of cargo in world seaborne external trade passes through the Canal, and in thisis included over one-half of the oil imported into Western Europe from theMiddle East. In addition, Western Europe obtained about one-fifth of itsimports of oil from the Iraq Petroleum Company pipeline acrossSyria. Although supplies are now being supplemented by additional imports from the Western Hemisphere, the closing of the canal and of the pipeline has caused a general . shortage of oil inEurope. The effects of the shortage vary from country to country,being naturally more acute in those which rely largely on imported oil thanin those where coal provides a high proportion of industrial fuel supplies.It is not yet certain what effect the oil shortage will ultimately have upontrade, since countries have been able so far to supplement their imported supplies by running down stocks of oil. Much depends upon the date whenthe Canal and the I.P.C. pipeline can be reopened, and upon the suppliesthat can be made available from the Western Hemisphere in the meanwhile.94. Provided there is no delay in clearing the Canal and in restoring oil supplies, a renewed upturn in European production in the second half of1957 may be expected. In view however of the restrictive measures, monetary and otherwise, taken by most countries in 1956 before the beginning of the suez crisis, and of the further measures that some countries will need to correct adverse balances, of payments, the expansion is likely to be at amore moderate pace than in recent years. The effect of the middle east situation on European price levels is not clear, but there may well befurther price increases.95. In the United States economy, the direct effects of the closing of the suez Canal are very small. There are some indications that the boom in business investment will slacken, but generally speaking no great changesfrom the present prosperous conditions seem likely, one way or the other.Prices have been showing some tendency to rise.96. The oil situation is not making any very great impact on the primaryproducing countries apart from those in the Middle East.  Many commodity
prices rose when the Suez Canal was first (blocked, but they fell back suib-sequently and there are no indications that any further rise is to be expected in the immediate future. Freight rates have risen since the middle oflast year, but may be expected to decline to some extent when the Canalis open again. If there is a general pick-up in economic activity later in theyear however there could be a sudden increase in the general level ofcommodity prices.97. The indications therefore are that markets as a whole will continue to expand, although not at the same rate as in 1956. Dollar markets togetherwith those of European countries which are least affected by the oil shortagewill probably expand more than others. The primary producing countries will in general offer further openings to United Kingdom exports.Prospects for the United Kingdom98. The general effects of the oil shortage in this country have not been asserious as might have been feared, though there has been a rather greaterincrease in unemployment than is usual at this time of year. Allocation and rationing of oil and petrol supplies are working well and there has beenvery little dislocation of transport or production. The motor industry inparticular was faced with difficulties due to the reduction in demand causedby fuel rationing, although production of cars has recovered to some degreesince the New Year. The industrial situation will continue to be somewhataffected by the shortage of oil until supplies are flowing freely again, andthe depleted stocks have been built up to reasonable working levels.99. The outlook will continue to be dominated by the necessities of thebalance of payments. We need a current surplus sufficient to finance our long-term investment overseas and to strengthen our position as an inter-national banker.

Our prospects, therefore, depend mainly on our success in theexpansion of exports.

118prices rose when the Suez Canal was first (blocked, but they fell back sub-sequently and there are no indications that any further rise is to be expected in the immediate future. Freight rates have risen since the middle oflast year, but may be expected to decline to some extent when the Canalis open again. If there is a general pick-up in economic activity later in theyear however there could be a sudden increase in the general level ofcommodity prices.97. The indications therefore are that markets as a whole will continue to expand, although not at the same rate as in 1956. Dollar markets togetherwith those of European countries which are least affected by the oil shortagewill probably expand more than others. The primary producing countries will in general offer further openings to United Kingdom exports.Prospects for the United Kingdom98. The general effects of the oil shortage in this country have not been asserious as might have been feared, though there has been a rather greaterincrease in unemployment than is usual at this time of year. Allocation and rationing of oil and petrol supplies are working well and there has beenvery little dislocation of transport or production. The motor industry inparticular was faced with difficulties due to the reduction in demand causedby fuel rationing, although production of cars has recovered to some degreesince the New Year. The industrial situation will continue to be somewhataffected by the shortage of oil until supplies are flowing freely again, andthe depleted stocks have been built up to reasonable working levels.99. The outlook will continue to be dominated by the necessities of thebalance of payments. We need a current surplus sufficient to finance our long-term investment overseas and to strengthen our position as an inter-national banker. The current balance was considerably improved last year.But the surplus was still quite inadequate to enable this country to meet all its overseas commitments and to start to build up the reserves to a point at which they are strong enough to take in their stride a temporary reversesuch as they have recently suffered, hicrcase-d imports will be needed when-thfl-CKpanoion of induatrial productiun L lUbiillMl aild to luiiipcuijali,-furthe reduction in net oil earnings that must nsult fiom tin ilo&amp;ing&quot; of the-Suob Canalr In addition, the drawing of $561 million from the international monetary Fund will have to be repaid by 1959. This means that, even if theterms of trade should improve slightly, exports must be increased more rapidly than in recent years and further that a considerable proportion of theadditional output will need to be exported, if the balance of payments is notto be worsened. There should be no lack of markets for these goods, butcompetition from the other main manufacturing countries will be keen, andBritish exporters will need drive and determination if they are to take full advantage of the expanding markets.100. Our prospects, therefore, depend mainly on our success in theexpansion of exports. The very heavy investment of the last two or threeyears has improved our industrial efficiency and expanded our capacity.Investment by private industry is likely to remain this year ait about itspresent high level, and investment in the basic services of fuel, power andtransport (including new road building) is expected to increase.
101. Thus our equipment for a further export drive has been considerablystrengthened. With good prospects for world trade, and with a record of rising exports, the external conditions for a successful year are alreadypresent. Internally, high savings and all possible restraint in government expenditure should create a situation favourable to the export effort and help us to avoid any undue increase in the level of imports when expansionis resumed. We can look forward to further progress in industrial invest-ment and with it further improvements in the living standards of the whole community only when the balance of payments has been placed on a reallysecure footing..
APPENDIXSURVEY OF PARTICULAR INDUSTRIESFuel and power. In 1956 home consumption of all forms of fuel and power rose by afurther 5 million tons to 255 million tons of coal equivalent, as is shown in thefollowing Table : 1955 1956Million tons Million tonsof coal of coalequivalent equivalentCoal (excluding coko exported)      ...       214 215Oil       ...............         35 39Hydro-electricity       ...      ...      ...          1 1250 255In spite of the check caused by the crisis in the Middle East, for the year as awhole the shift from coal to oil continued, though the prospects for 1957 are not certain. There was also a continuation of the trend from primary fuels to coke,gas and electricity.2. Coal output went up very slightly in 1956 to 222\ million tons, half amillion tons more than in 1955. Higher opencast production accounted for theincrease ; deep-mined output fell slightly, there being on the average rather fewermen at the pits during 1956 with output per man year remaining virtuallyunchanged. Losses caused by disputes, T8 million tons, although the secondhighest since the war were 0-9 million tons lower than a year ago, but this ismore than accounted for by the fact that there was a strike in Yorkshire in May,1955, which cost nearly one million tons. Gains in comparison with 1955 fromlower losses by disputes and from greater output per man shift were counter-balanced by lower Saturday output and higher absenteeism.3. Recruitment to the mines during 1956 was the highest since 1952 and,with fewer men leaving the industry, there was a net increase in manpowerduring the year of 3,500 compared with a fall of 5,200 during 1955. Neverfhe-less, at the end of the year the industry still had immediate vacancies for 9,000men mainly in South Yorkshire, the Midlands and South Wales.4. Inland coal consumption rose by 3 million tons in 1956. Power stations and coke ovens together used 5 million tons more coal than in 1955, industryand the collieries nearly 2 million tons less. There was little other change in consumption in spite of the colder weather. Exports of coke were higher thanin 1955 ; deducting coke exported and put to stock, inland consumption of coal was only one million tons higher in 1956. Stocks were maintained at a high level. Imports were reduced by over 6 million tons and exports (including ships&apos;bunkers) by 4 million tons.5. Although coal supplies in general have been adequate, there have beencontinuing difficulties in supplying certain grades and qualities. In particular,the large coal which is used in the domestic open fire has been getting scarcer,as increased mechanisation of the handling of coal results in more breakage. In1956, production of large coal fell by 3 million tons.6. Total production from United Kingdom oil refineries was almost 26million tons in 1956, an increase of f million tons over 1955. Exports increasedby H million tons to 12 million tons, the effect of the opening of new refinerieseast of Suez having been offset by the world wide increase in the oil trade.Imports continued to increase. Inland consumption rose to 25 million tons in1956, an increase of almost 2 million tons.7. The output from hydro-electric stations recovered from the low level of1955, when it had been depressed during the dry summer.
8. The use of electricity again rose substantially in 1956. Sales were 79,500million units, an increase of 9 per cent, and the maximum potential demand inthe winter of 1955-56 was 19,876 M.W., a 5i per cent increase on the previouswinter. The system was able to meet approximately 18,300 M.W. of this demand and the reduction was effected largely by dropping the frequency andvoltage of supply. In 1956 the amount of new plant commissioned reached the record figure of 2,037 M.W., of which 140 M.W. was for South of scotland board stations, and 100 M.W. in hydro-electric schemes in the North of ScotlandDistrict. The capital outlay by the industry in the calendar year was  247million, of which  135 million was invested dn generating and ancillary plant,  23million on main transmission and  87 million on distribution.9. Work started during the year on the biggest single power station ever tobe built in this country -a 1,000 MW. station with 200 MW. generating sets at high Marnham on the Trent, near Newark. During the year statutory consentwas given for the Central Electricity Authority&apos;s first two nuclear power stationsreferred to in the Government^ White Paper &quot; A Programme of Nuclear Power &quot;(Cmd. 9389). They are due to come into operation in 1961 and will have a combined output of 575 M.W. The South of Scotland Electricity Board have applied for consent to build the third nuclear power station in the programme at Hunterston, near Largs on the Ayrshire coast. This is the largest nuclear power station so far planned in the world. The Authority&apos;s plan to save coalby burning fuel oil at a selected number of conventional power stations wasunfortunately delayed by the Suez crisis, though the first station at Marchwoodhas been operating with heavily reduced quantities of oil.table 22&quot;.   coal output, consumption and exportsMillion tonsYears of 52 weeks each	1954	1955	1956Production:			deep-mined	213-6	210-2	2100opencastC)        ...      ...      ......	10-1	11 -4	12-1Inferior coal ...	0-2	0-5	0-4Imports	30	11-5	5-2Total supplies	226-9	233-6	227-7Consumption:			Gas        ...............	27-3	27-9	27-8Electricity......      ...      .....;	39-6	42-9	45-6Railways ...	13-6	12-8	12-8Coke ovens       ...      ...      ......	26-6	27-0	29-iron and steel(2) ...      ...      ......	6-7	6-5	6-engineering and other industry(2)	34-1	34-2	33-3Domestic and miscellaneousC2) ...	651	63-7	63-3Total inland       ......	2130	2150	218-2Cargo exports    ...	13-8	12-0	8-4Foreign bunkers ...      ...      ......	2-5	2-2	1-6Total use of coal ...	229-3	229-2	228-2Stocks at end of year:			distributed      ...      ...      ......	15-5	18-3	180undistributed ...      ...      ......	1-1	2-2	3-0Change in stocks during year(3)	- 2-4	4- 4-4   .	- 0-5(&apos;) Net amount available after washing and screening.(2) Industrial undertakings using less than 1,000 tons of coal a year are included under the&quot;domestic and miscellaneous&quot; item.(3) Includes changes in stocks held by consumers not making returns and changes in thetonnage of coal in transit.
10. Supplies of gas were nearly 1 per cent higher than in 1955, greaterquantities being obtained from coke ovens. The amount of coal consumed bythe industry fell slightly. Supplies of coke fell by nearly   million tons and stocks at gasworks rose by slightly more than this. By the joining up of moredistribution networks further progress has been made in concentrating produc-tion at the larger and more efficient gas works. Research and development hascontinued on improving the technique of carbonising coal and on increasing theoutput of better quality gas coke. Production of specially reactive cokes toreplace coal burnt on open fires has been brought to the commercial stage and small quantities of these cokes are now on the market.11. The Government have continued to give the maximum encouragement to greater efficiency in the use of fuel. While the investment allowance for industrialplant and equipment was generally withdrawn by the Finance Act, 1956, it wasretained for fuel saving devices scheduled by Statutory Order. government loans to finance fuel saving schemes have been approved up to  3^ million, ofwhich  2 million was approved in 1956. The demand for the services of theNational Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service has continued to expand.Steel12. Steel production in 1956 reached 2066 million ingot tons, an increaseof 0-87 million ingot tons over 1955. It had been hoped that production in 1956would reach 21-3 million tons but this was prevented mainly by the loss of output resulting from the maintenance workers&apos; ban on overtime. Imports fellslightly from 186 million ingot tons in 1955 to 1-77 rmllion ingot tons in 1956(of which 1-4 million tons were brought in by consumers), and 0-31 million ingottons of re-usable material became available to increase supplies to consumers.Producers&apos; stocks rose by 0-21 million ingot tons to support the higher levelof steel output. Total supplies of steel in 1956 amounted to 22-5 million ingottons, of which 19-2 million ingot tons went to home consumers and 3-3 million ingot tons were exported. During the year merchants&apos; and consumers&apos; stocksincreased by about 081 million ingot tons and the rise in consumption comparedwith 1955 was about 053 million ingot tons.13. The check in the home demand for a wide range of durable metalconsumer goods was reflected in the pattern of steel deliveries in 1956. deliveries of sheet to the motor, cycle and aircraft industries fell heavily in May. In1956 as a whole they were 20 per cent below the previous year&apos;s level. By theend of the year supplies of sheet from home production were becoming sufficientto satisfy demand from other industries and imports fell sharply in the second halfof the year, so that only 0-20 million tons were brought in during 1956 asagainst 0-46 million tons in the previous year. The shipbuilding industry received14 per cent more steel in 1956 than in the previous year, while deliveries, to theconstructional engineering industry increased by 8 per cent. Imports of heavysections and plate, for which demand was strong throughout 1956, reached a total of 0-40 million tons during the year, 024 million tons more than in1955. Import duties on most iron and steel products are suspended until september, 1957. Following an improvement in supplies the duty on galvanisedsheet was reimposed in September, 1956, and the suspension of duty on tinplateand terneplate is to lapse in March, 1957. In November, 1956, fuel oil supplies for steel-making were reduced by 10 per cent but this cut has so far in themain been offset by using additional quantities of tar fuels. It would normally be expected that crude steel output would continue to increase throughout 1957but this will depend amongst other things on the level of oil supplies.14. The output from home iron ore mines and quarries was practicallyunchanged at 16-2 million tons while imports of iron ore increased by 1-5 million tons to 14-35 million tons. Freight rates increased considerably towards theend of the year as a result of the situation in the Middle East. Pig iron productionrose by 5-6 per cent or 0-70 million tons to 13-17 million tons. Imports of scrap were lower at 0-98 million tons and steel-makers&apos; stocks increased during the year by about 0-16 million tons.
15. In 1956 new coke ovens went into operation on the North East coast and in Lincolnshire, and two blast furnaces were completed on the North east coast and one in Lancashire. Nine new steel melting furnaces were completed in Lincolnshire, the North East Coast, Lancashire, Flintshire, South Wales and:in the Sheffield area, and new mills were completed in Sheffield and on theNorth West Coast. A new tinplate works went into operation in South Wales.A number of other schemes, to modernise primary and finishing capacity were also completed.table 23:   steel supplies and materials consumedMillion tons	1954	1955	1956Materials:			Production of pig iron and blast furnace			ferro-alloys    ...      ...      ......	11-88	12-47	13-17Consumption in steel-making of:			Pig iron         ...      ...      ......	9-77	10-43	11-19Scrap   ......      .........	10-29	11 09	11-21Steel supplies (ingot equivalent):			Crude steel production.........	18-52	19-79	20-66Imports   ......	0-47	1-86	1-77Total supply of crude steel(&apos;)   ......	19-49	21-56	22-53Home supply     ...      ...      ......	16-60	18-21	19-21Exports    ......      .........	2-89	3-35	3-32(&apos;) Includes re-usable steel and changes in producers&apos; stocks.The metal-using industries(1)16. The year 1956 saw a halt to the expansion of the metal-using industries which had run continuously from about the middle of 1953 to the end of 1955,total production in 1956 being estimated at about 24 per cent less than in theprevious year. This fall was the net result of two widely divergent trends, a steady increase in the production of capital goods and a sharp fall in theproduction of consumer goods. Demand for capital goods remained at a high level throughout the year anrd although production rose steadily the volumeof outstanding orders showed no significant reduction. Production of car sand durable household goods fell sharply in response to the Governmentsmeasures to restrict home demand, and towards the end of the year the Suezcrisis led to a further reduction in car output. Exports of capital goods increased and exports of consumer goods decreased. Production of some capital goodswas hampered throughout the year by shortages of some types of steel.17. Table 24 shows estimates of the supply and demand for products ofthese industries in 1954, 1955 and 1956. It is estimated that in 1956 suppliesmeasured at 1955 prices fell by  115 million in spite of the  10 million rise in imports. The fall in the demand for passenger cars and consumer goods forthe home market amounting to about  160 million was approximately offset byan increase in exports of  100 million and an increase in supplies for investment of  65 million. For the seoond year in succession there was a fall in thedemand for defence.18. Table 25 gives some details of production and exports dn the metal-using industries. Production of plant and machinery increased by about 6 percent. Deliveries of machine tools were 11 per cent higher by value than in1955. Deliveries of heavy electrical turbo-generators reached a record level,being 25 per cent higher than the previous year. Production of passengercars fell throughout the year, and was 21 per cent less than in 1955.(&apos;) The metal using industries comprise mechanical and electrical engineering, shipbuilding,the manufacture of vehicles and aircraft, and most other types of metal goods.

The output of merchant shipping from shipyards in the United Kingdom interms of completions rose in 1956 to 1-43 million gross tons as compared with1-28 million gross tons in 1955. Launchings, however, showed a decrease on the1955 figure (1-34 million gross tons as compared with 1-43 million gross tons),which shipbuilders attribute in part to their difficulties in obtaining steel.   The
123proportion of completions for overseas owners in 1956 was 57 per cent (809,000gross tons) compared with 44 per cent (570,000 gross tons) in 1955.20. The increase in new orders in 1955 was well maintained during 1956, thelast quarter being particularly good. Total new orders for the year were 2-28million gross tons as compared with 2-43 million gross tons in 1955. Unlike 1955,however, when tankers predominated in the second half of the year, the greater number of orders in 1956 were for cargo vessels, although 40 per cent of thetotal gross tonnage ordered was for tankers. 31 per cent of the total tonnageordered was for overseas owners, as compared with 13 per cent in 1955. Thetotal order book rose from about 5i million gross tons at the end of 1955 to nearly 6\ million gross tons at the end of 1956. This is the highest figure since1952 and represents approximately 4 years work at the current rate of output.Shipbuilders maintain that given adequate supplies of steel they could increase their total annual output to about If million gross tons with the existing labour force.21. The output of the aircraft industry continued to expand in 1956, pro-duotion, including research and development work, being about 8 per cent higherthan in the previous year. Employment at the end of 1956 was about A\ percent higher than a year earlier. There was evidence of a movement of resources from United Kingdom defence requirements to exports. The latter exceeded  100million, a 60 per cent increase on 1955. Exports to the dollar area doubled andaccounted for one-quarter of the 1956 total, thanks largely to sales of Viscountsto the United States. Contracts already booked for both military and civil typesprovide a reasonable assurance that the current level of exports can be maintained during 1957. Contracts recently signed and in prospect for aircraft and enginesshould help to sustain exports in succeeding years but some contraction in the size of the industry, nevertheless, seems likely to result from reduced government orders.22. The electronics industry was affected, particularly in the first half of theyear, by reduced home demand for domestic radio and television sets, and theoutput of the industry as a whole was 5 per cent below that of the previous year,in spite of increased production in the capital goods section of the industryand a greater effort in defence. Exports rose by one-fifth.23. Employment in the metal-using industries as a whole fell by 65,000during 1956, the motor vehicle and cycle industries accounting for most of thefall. There appears to have been a further addition to employment in the pro-duction of capital goods and this is shown in the figures for the machine tools,electrical machinery, and shipbuilding and ship-repairing industries ; but a fewindustries producing consumer goods, particularly the hollow ware, radio, tools and cutlery, and watches and clocks industries finished the year with a reducedlabour force. There was a drastic reduction in overtime in the motor industryand considerable short-time working.24. The volume of exports of products of the metal-using industries in 1956was 7 per cent greater than in 1955. Shipbuilding made a larger contributionthan usual. If ships are excluded the increase amounted to about 4 per cent.Exports of other capital goods including aircraft were 8 per cent higher, butexports of cars fell by 15 per cent, important reasons being the imposition of import restrictions by Australia and New Zealand and the increase in foreigncompetition: there was, however, a good increase in exports to the United States,and Canada. There is little evidence of any increase in the export of other types of consumer goods for which the home demand had declined and the increase was mainly in capital goods, components, and intermediate products.25. At the end of 1956 the output of road vehicles was still falling and withthe petrol shortage the immediate outlook for them is very uncertain. Productionof other consumer goods appears to have become stabilised but there are as yetfew signs of recovery towards the 1955 level. There are indications of a slightslackening in the pressure of home demand for capital goods but foreign ordersfor capital goods are coming in well. Order books are full and for manytypes of product equal to over one year&apos;s production.  There seems no likelihood
-    12of the expansion in production being halted in the immediate future for lack oforders. Although steel supplies have improved there remains a shortage ofplates and heavy sections which is limiting the output of some capital goods,particularly ships and railway wagons. Prices of materials used in the engineer-ing industries changed little during 1956 but showed a rising tendency at the endof the year ; adult skilled wage rates increased toy about 8 &quot;per cent. Pricesof the industries&apos; products are estimated to have risen on average 3 to 4 percent over the year.Building26. By the end of 1955 the load of building and constructional work had become rather more than the building and civil engineering industries couldhandle efficiently, particularly in industrial areas. This overload had led to someshortages of materials and labour. The year 1956 was one of stabilisation inwhich this excess load was gradually reduced to leave the industry more in balance.27. Total output in 1956 was about 7 per cent above that of the previous year. This was the result of a high level of employment with an increase in output per man.28. Housing, like other activities, was affected by the measures designed to restrain credit, and in the second half of the year ^here was some reduction inthe rate at which privately (built houses were being started. This, together witha further decline of 26,000 in the number of houses started by public authorities,suggests that the level of house building will again be somewhat reduced in1957. The total number of houses completed dropped from 324,000 to 300,000.Within this total the number of privately built houses increased from 116,000to 125,000.29. More private industrial building was done than in 1955, although thevolume of new work started was about 10 per cent less. For the year as awhole about an extra  60 million of industrial building work was done. Theamount of private building for commercial and miscellaneous purposes increasedby about  30 million.30. In the public sector, local authority non-housing programmes were ingeneral restricted to about the 1955 level; but more work was carried out on educational building, hospitals, roads and power installations.31. Home supplies of steel rods and structural steel, although greater thanin 1955, were again inadequate to meet the demand and imports had to beincreased to avoid serious delays on sites. Brick deliveries were slightly lessthan in 1955, reflecting the fall in housing work, tout the demand for cementincreased, to absorb at the expense of exports rather more than the quarterof a million tons increase in home production.32. Building costs were about 4 per cent higher at the end of the year thanat the end of 1955, due mainly to increases in earnings, in the price of somebuilding materials and in the cost of fuel and transport.33. Total building output in 1957 seems unlikely to be less than in 1956.Some reduction in the housing programme is likely, but this should be morethan offset by the amount of other new work completed for public authorities.Credit restrictions seem to have reduced slightly the demand for industrial building and for miscellaneous private work, but there is no evidence that output in these sectors will be much below the 1956 figure.Textiles and clothing34. Home demand for clothing was higher An 1956 than in any year sincethe war, and production was 4 per cent higher than in the previous year.Output of textiles, on the other hand, reflecting the level of export trade andcloth imports as well as conditions on the home market, remained virtuallyunchanged at the level to which it had fallen in 1955. The decline in activity in the cotton industry which was largely responsible for this fall persisted forthe greater part of 1956, and for the year as a whole production of cotton yarns
was 5 per cent, and that of cotton cloth 9 per cent, below the level of 1955.These figures conceal signs of recovery which appeared towards the end of theyear, however, when there was a substantial improvement in order-books, and short-time working which had persisted throughout the year was reduced tonegligible proportions ; some mills even found themselves short of labour. Thisrecovery was due largely to the restoration of confidence in raw cotton prices.Activity in the wool industry remained stable, increased output of the combingand worsted spinning sections being offset by reduced production in the woollensection. Production of spun yarns and fabrics of man-made fibres and mixtureswas a little higher throughout 1956 than in 1955 but still well below the 1953-54level. Output of staple fibre continued to rise,, but there was a slight declinein continuous filament production, largely because of the reduced demand fortyre cord.35. The labour force employed in the textile industry as a whole againdeclined, but the loss of about 20,000 was only half that which took place between1954 and 1955. There was no significant change in the numbers employed in the clothing industry.36. Consumers&apos; expenditure on clothing in 1956 increased (at constant prices)by 3 per cent over the 1955 level, and on this basis there was also a slight increase in the proportion of total personal expenditure devoted to clothing.Wholesalers&apos; stocks of clothing remained fairly high throughout the year. Whole-sale and retail prices rose by H per cent and 1 per cent respectively during1956, although retail prices had increased by about 3 per cent in the autumn of 1955.37. As Table 26 shows, exports of wool manufactures in 1956 were the highestfor five years. Particularly noticeable features of this trade over the last twoyears have been the rapid rise in exports of wool tops to China, Japan, India,Pakistan and Greece, and the increase in exports of worsted yarns and fabricsto Western Germany and of woollen fabrics to the U.S.A. and Canada. Demandfor worsteds on the Canadian market remains depressed, but the losses in exportsof worsted cloth which this has involved for the United Kingdom as a majorsupplier over the last few years have been more than made up by the gains onthe woollen side.38. Exports of cotton fabrics continued their downward trend: their volumehas declined by a third since 1953. Heaviest losses have been in Australia andSouth Africa, and in some African Colonial territories. In this generally dis-ecouraging picture it is noteworthy that exports to India, where tariff concessions in 1955 helped to encourage a modest specialised trade, have almost trebledin trlree years. The volume of cotton grey-cloth imports showed no further in-crease in 1956: indeed, although there was a rise in imports from Hong Kong,this was more than offset by a reduction in imports from Japan and India, andthe total was slightly lower than in 1955. The present relative stability of UnitedStates raw cotton prices has removed one of the main short-term difficulties ofthe cotton industry and this factor may help towards the maintenance in 1957of the recovery in production displayed in the last quarter of 1956.39. Exports of fabrics of man-made fibres and mixtures have also beendeclining steadily, but trade in the fibres themselves is being fairly well main-tained : the sharp increase in shipments of staple fibre in 1955 was due to circum-stances (hat are unlikely to be repeated.40. Prices of American^type raw cotton and of Egyptian (long staple) typemoved in opposite directions during 1956. The decision of the United StatesGovernment in August, 1956, to bring United States prices into line with world prices caused a sharp fall in American-type cotton prices in the autumnto bring the average for the year to some 12 per cent below the 1955 level.Prices of Egyptian-type cotton on the other hand rose rapidly in the first halfof 1956 to their highest level since the Korea boom and afterwards levelled&apos; off at only a little below their peak. Raw wool prices were falling in 1955 but a firm upward trend began in the second quarter of 1956 and continued almostto the end of the year. Prices of rayon yarn and filament remained unchangedfor the third year in succession.

Although the weather neutralised to a great extent an increase of 200,000acres in the tillage area, livestock production increased and the net agriculturaloutput for 1956-57 is estimated at 159 per cent of ithe pre-war level, against156 per cent in the preceding season.  Table 27 sets out the relevant figures.42. One of the main objectives of agricultural policy has long been theprovision of more animal feed from home resources. An increase of 335,000acres in the area under cereals should have made a substantial advance in thisdirection in 1956-57. However, had weather at harvest time reduced yieldsbelow the record levels of 1955-56, although a subsequent improvement enabledmost of the crop to be gathered. Some 50,000 additional acres were planted withpotatoes. There should he ample supplies for human needs and indeed a surplus.43. Cattle rearing for beef production continued to expand, and so too did the production of milk, both in dairy herds proper and in association with beef production. The extra milk has been used mainly in food manufacturing. Thenumber of sheep also increased and in response to consumer preference animalswere -slaughtered younger to produce more lamb and less mutton. Pig productionand numbers appear to be relatively stable.44. Both the numbers and the egg yield of the laying flock increased andthere was a substantial increase in the output of table poultry. The area undernearly all types of fresh vegetable increased while the acreage of peas harvesteddry declined. Production of apples and pears was above normal, but the softfruit crop was only average.45. New long-term assurances for agriculture were introduced in November.They provide for the continuation of annual reviews, but set limits to the reduc-tions that may be made after each review, both in the guaranteed price for

Special reviewswill in future be held only to meet exceptional circumstances. To help theindustry to increase its working efficiency in a direction where there is greatroom for improvement a new scheme of Treasury grants at the rate of 33y percent is to be introduced for investment in fixed equipment and long-termimprovements to land.46. In the same month the Governments policy for the pig industry wasmade known. A Pig Industry Development Authority will be set up with powers to stimulate improvements in production, processing and distribution,but there will be no alteration of the marketing system based on free marketsthat seem to be encouraging the adaptation and response to consumer demandneeded in the industry.47. Following a Public Inquiry into objections to the draft British Egg Market-ing Scheme, the Agricultural Ministers proposed a number of modifications tothe scheme which were accepted by its promoters. The scheme as modifiedwas subsequently approved by the Northern Ireland Parliament and then byParliament at Westminster. It was formally brought into force on 31st December,1956, but whether or not it comes into effective operation depends upon theresult of a poll of registered producers.48. Horticultural marketing has also been under investigation by a committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Runciman. Its report suggests that, while there is scope for improvements in returns to producers and in value to consumers from changes in detail of the present system of distribution, noradical alteration is called for.5132820)   Wt. 1547-1301   181, 101, 101   3/57   D.l.
