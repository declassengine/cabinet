secret.(57) 85 COPY NO1st April, 1957CABINETSUEZ CANALNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues were informed at their meeting on 28th Februarythat a new Ascount would be needed for the purpose of making to Egyptpayments of the kind known as &quot;ships&apos; disbursements&quot;, i.e. portcharges, payments for water and other services, as distinct fromCanal dues (C.C.(57) 14th Meeting, Item 3).    Officials have been considering the extent to which the proposed account should be madeavailable for other payments to Egypt, and their report is attached.(Their conclusions are set out in paragraph 11.)2.      I suggest that my colleagues will wish to consider:-(a) whether they agree with recommendations (a) and(b), the effect of which is that the proposed new No. 3 Account should be available for allcurrent transactions (the existing No. 1 andNo. 2 Accounts remaining blocked);(b) the timing of the approach which it is proposed should be made by the Bank of England tothe National Bank of Egypt.P.T.Treasury Chambers, S.W.T.30th March, 1957.PAYMENTS ARRANGEMENTS WITH EGYPTThis paper, prepared by officials of the Departments concerned,considers the extent to which the proposed new No. 3 Account, to be opened to receive payments to Egypt for port dues and services, shouldbe used to receive other payments to Egypt,        &apos;2,     It would not in any event be possible to restrict the use of thenew Account to payments to Egypt for port dues and services as
distinct from Canal dues.    A method will be required for paying canal dues and it is certainly desirable that, if possible, these should be paidin sterling not only by United Kingdom ships, but also by the ships ofother countries which were in the past accustomed to pay their dues in sterling.    At the very least, therefore, the No. 3 Account will have to beused for Canal dues as well as port dues and services.3.     At the present time, certain essential payments are being made from the Sterling Area in currencies other than sterling;  for example,maintenance payments for British subjects who are still in Egypt arebeing made in Swiss francs.    It would be desirable that these payments,too, should be made in sterling into the No. 3 Account.    Moreover, since we want other countries to pay Canal dues in sterling, we must make the account open to receive payments from them.     So far as countries inthe Transferable Account area are concerned, this would mean allowingany payments to be made into the new Account.    This is no concession to Egypt;  it merely means that Transferable Account countries withpayments to make to Egypt may in future do so in sterling as opposedto dollars or other currencies.4.      In addition, the question arises whether we should also allowfreely all normal current payments to be made into the No. 3 Accountfrom the United Kingdom, and the rest of the Sterling Area.While it would be technically possible to restrict the use of theNo. 3 Account to the special payments mentioned above and the paymentof Canal dues and ships&apos; disbursements, it would in practice be difficultto maintain this position.    We should come under great pressure toallow other Sterling Area countries, such as South Africa, Iraq and theColonies, to resume normal trade with Egypt on a sterling basis.5.      If this were done, we should be under great pressure to extendsimilar treatment to our own traders, who are the hardest hit by theexisting restrictions.     These restrictions are becoming increasingly difficult to enforce, since it is difficult to stop deliberate evasion byfalse declarations regarding the country of origin of imports.Difficulties also arise where quite legitimate processing of Egyptianproducts has taken place in a third country.6,     In practice, therefore, it seems probable that,once the No. 3Account has been opened, it will be difficult not to allow all currentpayments to be made freely through it to Egypt.    Indeed there is a risk that if we tried to open the No. 3 Account solely for the purpose of receiving Canal dues and ships1 disbursements, Egypt would reject itand demand payment of dues in some other currency.    Moreover, therewould be advantage to our longer term commercial interests in makinga start now with re-establishing trade and payments on a sterling basis.The present restrictions were never intended to be more than temporary and if they are continued much longer, will certainly affect still further the position and use of sterling as an international trading currency.If current payments were freed in this manner, we should, of course,expect Egypt to withdraw her present embargo on payments to theUnited Kingdom and Australia.7.     A Transferable No. 3 Account opened in the manner suggested above would not in any way require us to withdraw our present restrictions on the use of Egypfs No. 1 Account.    These should bemaintained until a satisfactory settlement of financial claims and counter-claims has been secured.
8.      If Ministers accept these recommendations, there remains aquestion of timing.    To secure cur objective - the use of sterling for essential payments - it would be desirable that, in the absence of direct Governmental contact with Egypt, the Bank of England should beauthorised to make an immediate approach to the National Bank ofEgypt and to discuss with them the setting up of a No. 3 Account onthese lines.    If such an approach is delayed, there is a danger that the egyptians may formulate some other proposal, e.g. that dues should bepaid in dollars, and their attitude on this point may harden,9.      Such an approach can be made entirely without prejudice to themanner in which dues should be paid (ia e. whether direct to Egypt or toan international authority).    Moreover, it will not be necessary to disclose to the Egyptians at the outset that the Account will be availablefor payments from the rest of the Sterling Area or for payments (otherthan ships&apos; disbursements) from the United Kingdom.     On the other hand,it will be necessary to disclose that the Account will be available for payments from Transferable Account countries.10.    This being so, there would seem to be every advantage in makingthe first approach to the National Bank of Egypt as soon as possible.While no doubt the precise timing must depend on wider considerations,e. g. the state of negotiations about the Four-Power proposals, it wouldseem that, if the approach is to have any success, it must be made within the next few days.Conclusions11.     The recommendations of officials are:-(a)The new No. 3 Account should be fully transferable,i. e. , it should be available not only for payments in respect of port dues and services, but also forCanal dues, for all current payments fromTransferable Account countries and from therest of the Sterling area(b)Our traders too should be allowed to use the account for payments for current trade, subject to thewithdrawal by Egypt of her restrictions on pay-ments to the United Kingdom.(c)The first approach to the Egyptians (in which the full extent of our proposals need not be disclosed)should be made within the next few days, the precise timing being settled by the Chancellorof the Exchequer in consultation with theForeign Secretary.26th March, 1957
