SINGAPORE CONFERENCE;   PROGRESS report memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies in C.(57) 48 I set out the outlines of the constitutional proposals to be discussed with the Singapore delegation.   In the discussionscertain modifications of those proposals have been suggested, and I there-fore need to consult my colleagues again before reaching finality in theConference.2. The essence of the proposals made in C.(57) 48 was -(i)  Singapore was to have complete internal self-governmentand we would not retain any powers within Singaporeother than the power to suspend the constitution.(ii)  Her Majesty&apos;s Government would retain responsibility for external affairs and defence, delegating some aspects oftrade and cultural relations to Singapore.(iii) There would be two Councils:   one dealing with internal security, on which a Minister from the Federation of malaya would sit, and on which the combined votes of theUnited Kingdom members and the Federation minister could over-rule the Singapore Government: and onedealing with External Affairs and Defence, which wouldbe a consultative body only.(iv) After a running-in period, a locally born personage wouldbecome The Queen&apos;s representative.(v)  We should seek two safeguards for our defence position -(a)  We should have a veto over what matters theInternal Security Council could vote upon.. (b)  The United Kingdom representative should be ableto require The Queen&apos;s representative to reserve for Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure any legislation which seemed to him to affect our ability to discharge our responsibilities for external affairs and defence.COPY NO.secret.(57) 7826th March, 1957CABINET
3. The Government of the Federation of Malaya have during theConference indicated their willingness to participate in the internal security Council, on condition that it only deals with matters of internal security, and provided they can withdraw after six months&apos; notice.4. The delegation have approached these matters from apolitical angle.   They want a settlement, but it must be one which theycan defend and justify when they return to Singapore.   They are appre-hensive of the attack which the power-hungry David Marshall and the pro-Communist elements could develop if they appear to have accepted a continuance of &quot;Colonial1 subordination. And their device to meet thepolitical pressures in Singapore is that they should not in future seem tobe subject to the unilateral decisions of the Colonial power, but only to decisions and powers in which the Government of the Federation of malaya share with the United Kingdom Government. They claim that theFederations interests and ours are identical in Singapore; so that wecan in partnership with the Federation enjoy the substance of power, while for their part they can accept decisions with which the Federation (&apos;ourbig brother across the Causeway1) is associated, without being open toattack as the tools of an imperial Government.5. They have therefore proposed that it should be for the internal security Council itself to decide if a matter in dispute was a matter ofinternal security with which the Council could properly deal, and that thisdecision should not be left to the arbitrary veto of the United kingdom representative (who they in any case wish to be Chairman of this Council).This means that a decision would turn on the vote of the FederationMinister.   But they claim that this need cause us no anxiety, since theFederation Government have made it abundantly plain that they will not allow themselves to become involved in any matters other than internal security matters.6. They propose that if a matter on which there is a difference of opinion is thus determined to be one of Internal Security, the decisionof the Council shall be binding.   And if it is not one of Internal Security,then it will fall to be discussed with the United Kingdom Government inthe other, consultative, Council, and there will be a binding obligation on the Singapore Government to meet any requirements put forward by theUnited Kingdom Government in the field of defence or external affairs.They further propose that if the Singapore Government should fail tomeet its obligations imposed either by a vote of the Internal security council in a matter of internal security, or by the existence of a UnitedKingdom requirement in the field reserved to us, then there should bemachinery by which the United Kingdom representative, as Chairman ofthe Internal Security Council, could require The Queen&apos;s representative to make an Order having the force of law to ensure that the obligationswere met.7. This proposal modifies our original scheme in two ways.   Itintroduces a sanction to enforce the fulfilment of their obligations by the singapore Government.   This is a bonus we had not thought to achieve,and one of some importance, since - whether or not it could be effectivelyapplied in all circumstances - it changes, insofar as United Kingdomrequirements in Singapore are concerned, the accent of the constitutionfrom the necessity to persuade on our part to an obligation to comply ontheirs.
8. At the same time, however, it removes the unilateral vetowe had contemplated retaining over the vote in the Internal Security-Council, and transfers the effective decision to the representative of theFederation Government.   This is in line with the delegation&apos;? general approach that, to be acceptable in Singapore, power must be exercised by the United Kingdom and the Federation acting together.   The risk inthis situation is that a matter which had both a defence aspect and an internal security aspect could, because of the latter, be properlyconsidered by the Internal Security Council who might take a voterequiring us to take some action or refrain from some action in the field of defence and external affairs reserved to us.   I put this to the chief minister, who refused to see it in this light, claiming that the Council,and above all the Federation member of it, could not possibly regard themselves as competent to take decisions in the field reserved to theUnited Kingdom, in which we were free to act as we pleased.   He did not wish however to insert limitations to this effect into the constitution,since he claimed this would give the impression that we were trying toweight all these provisions against the Singapore Government.9. The same &quot;condominium&apos; approach has been applied to theproposal regarding a veto on legislation.   The Singapore delegation are willing to accept that the United Kingdom representative should be ableto require legislation to be reserved for The Queen&apos;s pleasure,provided that it has been established in the preceding processes of consultation about it that the issues are properly those of external affairs or defence; in other words, provided there has been an opportunity for theInternal Security Council to rule - always supposing there to be a dis-agreement on this point - that it was not a matter of internal security . e. of law and order.   The delegation believe that in most matters itwould be clear whether they were matters of defence or external affairs,or whether of internal security:  in case of doubt or disagreement, theInternal Security Council should decide, by the negative process of sayingwhether it was a matter of internal security or not:  and that once it hadbeen determined it was not a matter of internal security, there should besanctions to ensure that the Singapore Government met United Kingdomrequirements - in the case of failure to act, the order by The Queen&apos;representative; in the case of legislation, the right of the United kingdom representative to require it to be reserved for The Queen&apos;s pleasure.10. I now have to inform the delegation whether Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment will accept this proposal.   I believe the delegation have made it sincerely and without sinister motive.   The Chief Minister says theyhave offered the sanctions because they would help to stiffen a weakGovernment in Singapore.   I accept that from their own political stand-point they are bound to insist on their principle of a sharing of the exerciseof power by the United Kingdom Government and the Federation Government.And I do not think they will settle if we insist on retaining the unilateralvetos I have discussed earlier.   This would damn them as &apos;Colonialstooges&apos; and give their opponents the cry that they had accepted thecontinuance of Colonial status.11. There are risks in what they propose, just as there is theadvantage of an intermediate power short of suspending the constitution.Ironically, it was our failure to secure this last which broke down the lastconference.   The risk is that if we got a recalcitrant Government in singapore, out to make trouble, and a hostile representative of theFederation on the Internal Security Council, votes might be taken seeking to inhibit or direct us in the fields reserved completely to us.   But as the delegation pointed out forcefully to me in discussion, if a situation of that
kind arose we should surely be at the point of suspending the constitution,and constitutional niceties would be irrelevant.    What both we ourselves andthe delegation are after is a constitution which offers a reasonable prospect, given good-will and co-oporation, of quiet government in singapore over the next few years, until the way opens up for Singaporeto join up with the Federation.   I do not think we can build a constitutionproof against a hostile Singapore Government:  if such a Governmentcomes to power we shall have to suspend the constitution.12. In all these discussions I am forced back to a realisation ofthe fundamentals of our position.   We can only govern in Singapore by force or by consent.   We can only fight Communism if we h?ve allies.The situation in Singapore is touch and go.   If Communism can be defeatedthere, it can only be done by an elected Government, backed by and working in harmony with Her Majesty&apos;s Government.   And it is the moderates in singapore, who have already shown their willingness to challenge andfight subversion, with whom we are now negotiating.13. If we do not reach agreement, Lim Yew Hock will resign.The Governor could carry on for a month or two, but would then have tohold elections.   They would be fought on a bitterly anti-British and anti-Colonial platform: the moderates would have failed, and the extreme leftand the pro-Communists could scarcely fail to win.   We should be facedwith demands far removed from the present not unreasonable approach,and would have to refuse them, and give the Communists the opening for civil commotion, strikes, riots and the rest, which we could only meet with increasingly repressive government and large calls for militaryhelp.   And we should have lost for good the moderate elements through which there is still a chance to work.14. I believe this assessment is realistic and without illusions.And I therefore seek my colleagues&apos; approval to accept the proposals putforward by the delegation.   They have advantages as well as drawbacks;and their over-riding advantage is that they offer a prospect of continuing the fight in Singapore through willing allies for as far ahead as any of usdare look in South East Asia,A.L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.1.26th March, 19574-
