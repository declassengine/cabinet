secret.(57) 57 COPY NO.6th March, 1957.cabinet public SERVICE salaries memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer as requested by the Cabinet on 28th February I have examined further the proposals made about public service salaries inmy memorandum C,(57) 42 in the light of the views expressed in theCabinet discussion.     (C.C.(57) 1 ith Conclusions, Minute 6).Members of parliament . I still think that we should abolish the sessional allowance and increase Members&apos; salaries to  1,500 or  1,750.     I am disposed,however, now to prefer the lower of these figures, because I still considerthat Ministers in the Commons should be enabled to draw the whole of theParliamentary salary and that this salary represents the inevitable gap in total remuneration between these Ministers and those in the Lords.The choice between these two figures is, therefore, one between wideningthis gap to as much as  1,750 on the one hand and on the other limiting the increase for back bench Members of the House of Commons to approximately  200 only.Ministers3. I remain of the opinion that the best and most acceptable waypolitically, of increasing the remuneration of most Ministers is to enableall Ministers in the Commons to draw the new Parliamentary salary infull, whether at  1,500 or  1,750.    If this is agreed 1 have come to thereluctant conclusion that no general increase in Ministerial salaries assuch should be made.     I would limit what we do in this respect to thefollowing:(a) The salary of  1,500 of Parliamentary Secretariesshould be raised to  2,000.(b) No other changes in Ministerial salaries as suchshould be made, but(i)  The Financial and Economic Secretaries tothe Treasury should be re-graded as ministers of State for salary purposes.     This would entitlethem to the present salary of  3,000 of ministers of State in place of their present salary of  2,000.-1-
(ii)  The Officers of the Household who act asWhips in the House of Lords and asDepartmental spokesmen should be re-gladed, on a new salary of  2,000 a year(equivalent to the new salary of a parliamentary secretary) in place of their present salary of 1,000.4. These proposals mean that, save for the special case ofthe Officers of the Household mentioned in paragraph 3 (ii) above, all ministers in the Commons will receive total remuneration larger thanthat of their counterparts in the Lords by the amount of the newParliamentary sala.ry.    I have given much thought to the question of reducing this gap, if possible by conferring on Ministers in the Lordssome allowance against which tax relief could be claimed.     I have cometo the conclusion that there is no means whatever by which we could doso, short of special legislation directed to the position of Ministers inthe Lords, which is in my judgment impracticable.    I am afraid, therefore,that we cannot, if we are to adopt this plan in relation to the salaries of Ministerial office, do anything to improve the position of ministers who are Peers except for the cases of the Parliamentary Secretariesand the Officers of the Household with representative duties.5. In summary, these proposals produce the following changesin Ministerial remuneration:   (the table is compiled on the suppositionthat the Parliamentary salary becomes  1,500).Gross EmolumentsSenior Minister(Commons(LordsPresent 5,0005,000New 6,5005,000Minister of State(Commons(Lords3,5003,0004,5003,000Financial and EconomicSecretariesCommons2,5004,500&apos;Parliamentary Secretary(Commons(Lords2,0001,5003,5002,000W hip(Commons(lords ,5001,0002,5002,000 *Re-grading.6. If these new proposals are acceptable to the Cabinet, itwould be appropriate to announce them, together with those relating to nationalised Industries Boards and Lower Judiciary, on about 21st March.Some time before this there would have to be discussions with theOpposition Leaders.
University Teachers7. If it is decided to grant an immediate interim increase todoctors and dentists in the National Health Service, I think it is inevitable that the increases in University salaries should be made effective from 1st April instead of being deferred to the opening of thenew academic year.Doctors-8. National Health Service pay for doctors and dentists isbeing considered separately.Other Public Services9. I have nothing to add to what is said in C. (57) 42 on theother topics covered by that Paper - viz., peers allowances, nationalised industries Boards, the Lower Judiciary and the Comptroller and AuditorGeneral.P.T.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.5th March, 1957.
