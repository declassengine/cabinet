SUEZ CANALMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 2nd April the Cabinet invited the Foreign Secretary and me toarrange for further consideration to be given to the technical preparations for the introduction of a No. 3 Account for current payments between the sterling area and Egypt on the understanding that no communication   onthis subject would be made for the time being to the National Bank ofEgypt (C.C.(57) 28th Conclusions, Minute 5).2.     At a meeting of Ministers on 4th April,I was asked to arrange, inconsultation with the Foreign Secretary, for further examination of theproposal that Canal dues should be paid into an Egyptian account with theBank of International Settlements (3. I.S.).3.      This note deals with these two matters.Payment of dues to the B.I.S.4.      This suggestion was made informally by the Egyptians to theBoard of the B.I.S.    It would appear that thereby they hoped to ensurethat dues were paid into an account which would be immune from suit byother claimants and which could not be blocked by governmental action.The former assumption is probably unfounded though the Bank&apos;s immunitieshave yet to be tested in the Courts.5.      The Board decided that they could not agree, since the Bank wouldbe involved in operations it was not competent to undertake.    Butcircumstances might arise in which the Bank could play a useful part in helping the functioning of any agreement that might be reached betweenthe parties.    The Egyptians were therefore told on 7th April that, ifthey were to repeat their request formally, it would be necessary for theBoard, in the somewhat abnormal circumstances, before it could decide whether the account should be opened or not, to refer the matter to itslegal advisers and to ask a number of questions about the intended useof the account.    No decision would be taken before 6th May.6.      It appears, therefore :-(a)    That the B.I.S. is unlikely to open an account with theNational Bank of Egypt unless there has been aninternational agreement about the method of collection and payment of dues.COPY NSECRETC.(57) 9916th April, 1957CABINET
(b) The B.I. S. would probably not wish to open an account toreceive the whole of the dues if they were entirely atthe disposal of the National Dank of Egypt.    They would regard this as more in the nature of a normal bankingfunction which should be discharged by central banks.If, however, there were to be an agreement that acertain proportion of the dues should be kept on depositto be used ultimately for paying compensation or financing the development of the Canal, the B.I.S. might be willingto open an account in favour of the National Bank ofEgypt for this purpose.(c) If such an account were opened, our representative on theBoard should urge that it should be kept in sterlingsince most of the dues are paid in sterling or in currenciesof the transferable account area readily convertible intosterling.    Moreover, the expenditure on development and compensation will be mainly in the transferable account and sterling areas.    In any event we should resist anyproposal by the Egyptians that the account should be agold deposit account which would give them the equivalent of an exchange guarantee for that part of thedues deposited in it.7. At the Ministerial meeting on 4th April it was suggested that we might use the offer of an account with the 3.I.S. as an inducement to the egyptians to accept dues in sterling without pressing for the unblockingof their No.l Account.    From certain remarks, however, made byEgyptian representatives at a recent B.I.S. meeting, it looks as if theywould be prepared to accept transferable sterling for such a purposeprovided it were credited to an unblocked account.    The proposedNo. 3 Account would, of course, fulfil this condition.The Egyptian No. 3 Account8. Since in practice dues could not be paid directly to the B.I.S.,this account will be needed, whatever decision may be taken about theopening of an account by Egypt with the B.I.S.9. In my memorandum (C. (57) 85) it was argued that, while it would be technically possible to restrict the use of the proposed No. 3 Account tothe payment of Canal dues and ships&apos; disbursements and to certain specialpayments at present being made in the sterling area in currencies otherthan sterling, it would in practice be difficult to maintain this position andthere would be pressure to allow United Kingdom residents to use the account for payments for current trade, provided Egypt withdrew herrestrictions on payments to the United Kingdom.10. Nevertheless, it is agreed that it is not necessary to discloseto the Egyptians at the outset that the account will be available for payments from the rest of the sterling area (which is for the exchange control authorities of the sterling area countries to decide) or for pay-ments (other than Canal dues and ships&apos; disbursements) in the UnitedKingdom.     In spite of the pressures referred to in C. (57) 85, it willbe for Ministers to decide whether, and if so when, United Kingdomresidents should be allowed to make payments to Egypt through the newaccount.
313911. The Governor of the Bs.nk of England asked for instructions inwriting from me before he communicated any proposal on this subject tothe National Bank of Egypt.    Annexed is a letter which I propose tosend him.    It will be seen that no action will be taken under this letteruntil a further communication is sent to the Bank of England by theTreasury.12. The Cabinet has agreed that only after discussions first inthe Security Council and subsequently in the Council of the Suez CanalUsers Association should the Bank of England be authorised to open discussions with the National Bank of Egypt.    They agreed, however,that these steps should if possible be taken in rapid succession (C. C.(57)33rd Conclusions, Minute 4).    In the meantime H. M. Ambassador atWashington has informed the State Department in strict confidence of our proposals about the payment of dues through a new No. 3 Account.    Itwill also be necessary to inform the French and Commonwealth Govern-ments.    I propose that this should be done just before the approach tothe National Bank of Egypt.Conclusions12. These can be summarised as follows:-(1) The B.I.S, is only likely to agree to open an account forthe receipt of dues if there is an international agree-ment about the method of payment and if this involvesearmarking a proportion for compensation or for future development.    Such an account if set up shouldbe in sterling.(2) Whatever arrangements may be made with the B.I.S., theproposed No. 3 Account with the Bank of England wouldalso be needed.(3)  There is evidence that Egypt would be content with our proposals for a No. 3 Account and would not stipulate,as a condition of payment in transferable sterling,that the No. 1 Account should be unblocked.(4)  When the time comes to put our proposals for a No. 3Account to Egypt, we shall not have to disclose thatit may be available for payments from the rest of the sterling area or from the United Kingdom.    Thelatter would be subject to a further decision by ministers.P.T.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.16th April, 1957.
DRAFT LETTER FROM THE chancellor to MR. GOVERNORAs you probably know, there have already been discussions between officials of the Treasury and the Bank of England about the arrangements that might be made to enable British or any other shipping using the suez canal to pay for Canal dues and other essential services in sterling.2.        I am now writing to inform you that the Government have decided in principle that, in order that these payments may be made in a formlikely to be acceptable to the Egyptian authorities, an approach should bemade to Egypt suggesting the opening of a fully transferable account inthe name of the National Bank of Egypt at the Bank of England or at acommercial bank.    This account would be specially designated and sterlingaccruing to it would be available for use in the same way as that accruing to any other transferable account in the United Kingdom.    It would not benecessary at this stage to inform the National Bank of Egypt what payments to this account (other than for Canal dues and essential services) would be permitted for United Kingdom residents.3.        I cannot yet say when this approach should be made to theEgyptian authorities because it depends on political developments, but itmay be necessary to make an approach to Egypt at very short notice.4.        Because at the moment diplomatic relations between her majesty&apos;s Government and Egypt are not in existence and, since what is involved is the creation of the necessary banking facilities to enablecertain payments to be made in sterling, I would be grateful if you could see your way to arrange for a communication to be sent at the appropriate time by the Bank of England to the National Bank of Egypt in the termsalready agreed between the Treasury and the Bank of England.    No doubtit will be convenient to you if the appropriate time for sending the communication is notified to the Bank by the Treasury through the normalofficial channels.
