NATIONAL INSURANCE:  DEATH grant memorandum by the Minister of Pensionsand National InsuranceMy Home Affairs Committee r&apos;  .er H.A.(57) 30, contains a summaryof the main points arising on the re, jrt which I have received from theNational Insurance Advisory Committee on their review of the death grant,which was referred to them by my predecessor.   A copy of the report, isattached to H.A.(57) 30.2.    The Advisory Committee&apos;s main recommendation, which requireslegislation, proposes an alteration in the basis on which the grant isawarded so that instead of depending, as now, on the payment of funeral orcertain other expenses of an appreciable amount, the benefit would becomesimply a grant payable on death and become one of the assets of the deceased, in the same way as arrears of other National Insurance benefitsat present do.3.    The present provisions have worked well for the large majority ofcases, but there is a minority in which either the grant cannot be paid ina deserving case or has to be paid to a third party as the result of onlytrifling expenditure by him.4.    There is a minor recommendation which gives rise to some difficulty.   At present National Insurance benefits are payable to a man inrespect of the illegitimate children of a woman living with him, whether byhim or another man.   The Advisory Committee recommend that a manshould be eligible for death grant in respect of such children if they die,I am not very happy about this recommendation and would be grateful forthe Cab met&apos;s guidance on it.5.    I seek approval for acceptance of the recommendation summarised inparagraph 2 and the Cabinefs views on the recommendation referred to inparagraph 4.J .-A. ju-. t C.Ministry of Pensions and national Insurance, W.C.2.COPY NO.22nd March, 1957CONFIDENTIALC.(57) 7523rd March, 1957CABINET
