(56) 283) on the policyI to he followed in the Security Council about Kashmir. The question wasI considered in Cabinet on the 20th December and 15th January (CM. (56)I 104th Conclusions, Minute 10 and C.C. (57) 1st Conclusions, Minute 7). TheI instructions sent to our representative at the Security Council (Sir Pierson Dixon)I were that -&lt;(a) We recognised the force of .the Pakistan Government&apos;s argument thathopes of progress by direct negotiations have been disappointed. Wetherefore fully supported Pakistan&apos;s desire to get the issue settled byhaving it raised again in the Security Council.(b) In particular we fully supported Pakistan&apos;s request to the Security Council] to ask India to refrain from accepting the Constitutional changeenvisaged in the new Constitution adopted by the so-called ConstituentAssembly of Srinagar.(c) We continued to regard the existing United Nations resolutions as valid f^hand to stand by them.(d) We were -prepared to support tshe principle of an international force if aproposal to this end were put forward. L^h(e) If the suggestion were to be put forward that a new plebiscitel^h            &apos;i(^m      administrator should %e appointed with a view to his going to Kashmirand then reporting to the Security Council on arrangements for aplebiscite, timing, &amp;c, then Sir Pierson Dixon should support it.I   3.  In the event, our action in (the Security Council went Kttle beyond? paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above.  As regards (d), the United Kingdom jointlyHsponsored with America, Australia and Cuba a resolution which noted theBPakistan proposal for an international force and requested the President of the *BSeeurity Council {for February this was Mr. Jarring) to examine it (among other?proposals) with the Governments of India and Pakistan. This resolution provoked? strong Indian opposition and was vetoed by Russia. The next resolution whichHwe and the Americans and Australians also joined in sponsoring did no more than?request the President of the Security Council to examine any proposals to achieveI Ha settlement, without any specific reference to an international force.  This wasBpassed 10-0, with Russia abstaining. f^^J4.  We now face a most difficult situation, and we must consider the nextl^h       Hsteps carefully.Blndia and Pakistan : The stakes at issue L^^B}    Mi) Economic f^^B^^B 5.  Our economic stakes in India are high. The United Kingdom investmentBn industry and business is very large. India is bound to go ahead with her plans
^^^1 for industrialisation and general economic development4an4&gt;wuT berail ever-increasing market for machinery and manufactured goods, of which we shouldbe able to.take full-advantage.     &apos;v^. ./,t .   j&gt; ^fe&amp;&apos;fei i b^h- 6. Now that-the threat of further nationalisation and of discriminatorytaxation of foreigners seems to have receded, the prospects of increasing businessappear to be reasonably good. If, as a result of political hostility arising from theKashmir dispute, India decides to leave the Commonwealth and the sterling area,we should lose our preferences for exports to India and the sterling area would f_tsuffer great damage. Our previous experience of India has been, however, thather economic policies are likely to be calculated primarily in terms of self-interest.7. Pakistan&apos;s economy by contrast is weak and her earnings of foreignexchange meagre. There is unlikely to be any marked improvement in the IIforeseeable future. It is possible that oil may be found in Pakistan on a largescale, but even so standards of living would be slow to rise and it is unlikelythat our export trade to Pakistan could be significantly increased. The divisionof the country into West and East Pakistan is a permanent cause of friction andweakness.8. Our economic interests might be endangered by a move of the IndianGovernment towards the Left. Moreover there is the possibility that, if Nehru&apos;s IIinfluence were removed, there might later be a break-up of unified India with a_^^H consequential slowing down of the economy. However this turns out, our economicconnections with India are of great and increasing importance to us. They are now,and are likely to remain, of much greater importance to us than our economicconnections with Pakistan.(ii) Political9. From the political point of view, we cannot at the best expect more thancritical support from India, which claims to be one of the &quot; uncommitted &quot; nations.That a Member of the Commonwealth should regard herself as uncommitted asbetween the Communist Powers and the West is difficult to accept, especially sinceLVaVaH India&apos;s policy is open to the interpretation that she leans towards the U.S.S.R. LVgVfl(as e.g. initially over Hungary) rather than ourselves.10. Mr. Nehru is bitterly hostile to the Baghdad Pact and to the South-EastAsia Treaty Organisation (S.E.A.T.O.). In this, India&apos;s policy is similar to that ofRussia. In any trouble which we may have in the Middle East, India will almostcertainly not be with us.11. Nevertheless, while India may align herself on specific issues with Russiawhen it suits her purpose, it is contrary to her long-term interest to vest her securityin a close tie-up with Russia and China.   They are both exacting friends and_^^H potential enemies, and India&apos;s permanent interest would seem to lie in keeping afoot firmly in the Western camp. Even at present, India is of considerable helpto us in many ways; the Indian Army and Navy are friendly with us and we retaingood contacts. As China expands, India is likely to look more and more to theWest with a tendency to closer co-operation.12. India&apos;s support could be of considerable value to us in South-East Asia.| ;  By the same token we are particularly vulnerable, in the changing conditions inMalaya and Singapore, to Indian hostility.   Such positions of influence and^^^H strength as we still retain in South-East Asia could be more easily undermined if^^^1 India were working against us.  Should India leave the Commonwealth, Ceylongfg^H and Malaya would be likely to follow within a few years.13. Pakistan&apos;s present Government is anti-Communist. She co-operatesfully with us in the Baghdad Pact, although it must be owned that the Pakistanis^^^M see it as largely directed against Afghanistan and India. The same is true of theirattitude to S.E.A.T.O. Even when the current intake of United States military aid^^^H has been digested, Pakistan&apos;s willingness and capacity to deploy any actual militaryeffort outside her own country would be very small. But in quality all her armed^^^1 Services are good.  In the new circumstances of the Middle East, the Baghdad^^^M Pact is of increased importance in furthering our Middle East policy, and sincethe beginning of November Pakistan has signally buttressed the staunchness of -Mmthe Pact. members. But Pakistan has as yet achieved little inherent strength, and^^^H the continuance of her present pro-Western policies remains too dependent forV^^^H our comfort on the survival in power of a small cadre of, key personalities.

mum mumUnited Kingdom objectives n&lt;szk m14. The foregoing shows that we heed the friendship and support of bothcountries. It is not yet time to conclude that we must choose between them. Ourpolicy must aim at preventing a situation from arising in which this painful choicebecomes necessary. At the same time, we must not, by being over-cautious, alienate ^^fl^^fl        both.   We have a difficult tightrope to negotiate and only the consolation of&apos;knowing that we have succeeded in walking it so far without disaster.  But thisW has not brought a solution of the Kashmir problem nearer. irjWe are now faced m^Mwith a much tenser situation.  Our freedom of action has been greatly narrowedI The next stage15. Our attitude in the past has always been that we did not wish to take^^fl      I sides in this difficult controversy between two members of the Commonwealth m^M^^fl and that our sole interest was to promote a settlement acceptable to both parties.I This attitude was successfully maintained because both parties accepted the basic W^MI resolutions of the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (U.N.C.I.P.),^^fl      I which provided for a plebiscite after demilitarisation.   Between 1949 and 1953I both sides considerably modified their original positions and showed at leastI      I some degree of willingness to reach a settlement on the basis of these resolutions.I During the direct negotiations in December 1953, it seemed as though a settlementI might be in sight.  The negotiations were, however, broken off by India on theI grounds that American military aid had changed the strategic situation in theI sub-continent.16. The Indians had not until recently rejected the idea of a plebiscite.I Indeed, at the recent Security Council meetings, Mr. Menon, the Indian MinisterI without Portfolio, while insisting on the dangers of a plebiscite, has specificallyI reaffirmed that India stands by its international obligations. But at the same timeI he has insisted on an interpretation of the U.N.C.I.P. resolutions, which is likelyI to continue to prevent any progress in implementing them. Moreover, in NewI Delhi, in London and in New York, the Indians have said that a plebiscite couldI not be contemplated in present circumstances, because it would endanger the veryI conception of a secular State, on which the Indian Union is built, and would lead toI communal disturbances and bloodshed on a vast scale. We are therefore faced withm^M     I the fact that the possibility of ever settling the Kashmir dispute by an agreedI plebiscite is remote. Therefore, the line which we have previously taken-that weI are anxious to promote any attempts to reach a settlement within the frameworkI of the U.N.C.I.P. resolutions-is no longer regarded by India as a neutral line. WeI are forced, in India&apos;s eyes, into a partisan position, not by any policy or act of ourI own, but by India&apos;s own change of policy-which it is claimed is the result ofI changing circumstances since the idea of a plebiscite was first accepted.17. There is no possibility of an early solution of the Kashmir problem. TheI issues at stake are of such importance to us that we must refuse to be rushed; onI the other hand, we must not appear to the Pakistanis to be deliberately usingI delaying tactics.18. Our immediate aim must be to help, if we can, towards making a successI of the mission which has been undertaken by the President of the Security Council.I This means in practice that we must try to persuade the Indians, if they now rejectI the U.N.C.I.P. resolutions as a basis for an agreed settlement, to make some otherI suggestion. This will, of course, require very careful handling, since neitherI party wishes to make the first gesture. Moreover, the President is enjoined, inI considering any proposals, to have regard to the existing resolutions, which ifI interpreted narrowly could limit severely the field of consideration.19. India is unlikely to go beyond an offer of a settlement on the presentI cease-fire line with minor frontier rectifications. Such an offer would not beI acceptable as it stood to the Pakistanis and will not provide the basis for anymmm     I Pr gress before 15th April when Mr. Jarring is called upon to report. But it mightm^M     I just be sufficient to enable further exploratory talks to be undertaken. In the courseI of these it might be possible also to obtain some improvement in the atmosphere bymm advances on other problems such as the division of canal waters (a settlement ofI which, however, would require massive outside financial aid). Perhaps, too, IndiaI might be brought to offer some prospect of increased political freedom in Kashmir,
?fl m\\\\KVfl                short of putting the question of secession in issue. Much will depend on how ^^B^-\m\                 anxious Mr. Suhrawardy&apos;s Government is to dispose of the Kashmir problem and ^^B^H\W                what political risks it is prepared to run. For the moment, the Pakistanis are, no ^k-M^LmmM                 doubt, elated with their recent successes; but they may well now be told with ^^B^-\m                some emphasis that at this stage any further attempts to put India publicly in the WA9Mdock will defeat their own object. ^LmWKVAV                      20.  We must clearly attempt to ensure that -during the next stages, Indian Jm* ^L\m\and Pakistani hostility is not directed exclusively at us. Over the last nine years, wM ^^B^LmmTt                we have consistently taken &apos;the view that we have a duty as a permanent member H ^LmWBVAJ                 of the Security Council, as a member of the Commonwealth and as the former B&apos; ^^Bparamount Power to play an active part in finding a solution to the Kashmir ^^B^-mW                 problem.  We have led in the Kashmir debate; we have jointly sponsored the ^^BBVfl                United Nations resolutions on Kashmir. We cannot resign our interest without H ^^Bdamaging our position both in the Security Council and the Commonwealth; but B ^^Bwe are justified in asking the United States-and Canada-to work in close ^^BBVAV                 conjunction with us in this matter. ^^B21.  I propose, therefore, that we should seek to discuss soon with the United ^^BStates and Canada what effective joint action the three of us can take so as to ^^BWMMMM                 obtain the best possible results from the President of the &apos;Security Council&apos;s Mission, B ^^Band to avoid a stalemate in the Security Council in May. In particular, we must ^^B&apos;try to get the Indians to make some constructive move. ^LMMm\\\\ mtmBVAV                      Commonwealth Relations Office, S*W-1, mmmm4th March, 1957.I IB??BBVBh bBBBBB
