confidential.(57) 54 COPY NO.1st March, 1957.CABINETSUEZ CANAL USERS&apos; ASSOCIATION:PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Suez Canal Users&apos; Association (S.C.U.A.) is committed to giving the Administrator, Mr. Bartels, a net fee for one year fromhis engagement on 1st November, 1956, of  6,400 and net emolumentsto the few experts on his staff.     S.G-.U.A. is temporarily operating fromoffices in London and we have no means at present of exempting these payments from United Kingdom income tax.     It would be unreasonable to ask the members of S.C.U.A. to pay the gross sums necessary (in thecase of Mr. Bartels, a gross sum of some  45,000 would be needed to produce  6,400).2. S.C.U.A. became dormant after the Anglo/French intervention in Egypt:   otherwise arrangements would have been made to put in hand to regularise the Association^ international standing by means of a status Agreement negotiated with the members (on the lines of thatfor Western European Union), accompanied by a corresponding Orderin Council (under the International Organisations (Immunities and privileges) Act, 1950) to give the necessary privileges and immunitiesin the United Kingdom, including exemption from income tax for the administrator and senior staff.    S.C.U.A., has now started operationsagain, and the Administrator and his small staff are already working on an urgent shipping study.     In any case it is to our interest tomaintain it in being for the present.3. The staff are liable for tax on their emoluments.    (in mr. Bartels&apos; case with effect from 1st November, 1956).    As the hostgovernment we must find some quick means of granting tax exemption.The problem is a small one at present, being limited to the emolumentsof:(a) Mr. Bartels, who is paid wholly by the Association;(b) his Italian economic expert and Danish assistant,whose salaries are paid by their governments and who receive certain additional emolumentsfrom the Association.The third member of Mr. Bartels&apos; senior staff, a shipping expert,is British and could not therefore be granted tax exemption on anyemoluments he may receive (he will probably ask nothing).     It is possiblethat a non-British financial expert may be appointed on similar conditions to the others.    Other privileges are not necessary forthe Associationat present.-1-
4. Tax exemption in the United Kingdom cannot properly begranted by administrative m eans.    Tax exemption could be granted by an Agreement and an Order in Council under the 1950 Act providingfull privileges and immunities in the United Kingdom for the S.C.U.A.This would be the orthodox (and lengthy) method;  but would be prematurebecause:(a) the S.C.U.A.&apos;s headquarters may move to anothercapital in a few months;       and(b) the future of the Association and its membership is uncertain.The required tax exemption could also be granted by a simpleAgreement and Order in Council limited to tax exemption for the emoluments for the Administrator and a small staff of experts.    Theonly difficulty is that tax exemption on the Administrator^ salarymust be retroactive to 1st November, 1956 and in the case of the expertsretroactive for several weeks.     But this point arises in any solution;and the longer the delay in bringing the Agreement and Order in Councilinto force the longer period of retroactivity v/ill be.    If the limitedAgreement provided for exemption retroactively, the Order in council might reasonably make a corresponding provision, and this could be defended in public.5.   RecommendationI accordingly recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to the S.C.U.A. be authorised to propose as soon as possible, andas the most convenient formality for the host government, a limitedAgreement exempting from income tax the emoluments paid by theS.C.U.A. to the Administrator and his senior international staff;  thatan Order in Council under the International Organisations (immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950, be laid before Parliament to give effect tothis exemption in the United Kingdom;   and that the question of a future agreement on wider privileges and immunities should be left in abeyance until the future of S.C.U.A. is clearer.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.I.1st March, 1957.
