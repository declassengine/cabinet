CREDIT TRADING bill memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in paragraphs 5 and 6(b) of C(57) 52 the L,ord Chancellorraises the possibility of the Credit Trading Bill going forward withoutthe provisions of Part II (i. e. only giving permanent powers to regulate the terms of hire purchase agreements as set out in Fart I), as analternative to postponing the Bill altogether.2. There are two main policy reasons for Part II of the Bill.(a) To protect depositors and to avoid the shock to thefinancial system that would follow if hire purchasefinance companies got into difficulties as a result oftheir present unsound practices.The likelihood of a run on hire purchasefinance companies by depositors is difficult to assess,but a small decline in confidence could lead to immediate failure of companies that have insufficientliquid assets, and could result in a consequential runon other sounder companies.   The government proposal to regulate these companies has receivedconsiderable publicity since it was announced inThe Queen&apos;s Speech last November and there v/ould be serious criticism if any companies failed and no action had been taken.(b) To enable the supply of finance to the hire purchasefinance companies to be regulated by prescribinglimits to total borrowing in relation to capital resources.This would be an important addition to our instru-ments for adjusting the balance of the economy bymonetary measures.   The Bill&apos;s provisions for thispurpose are both needed and confidently expected by thebanking and financial community, and if we drop themwe shall aggravate our difficulties in getting the bankersto respond to monetary pressure and to guidance on the credit control.   It will seem to them that the Governmentare disinclined to control the hire purchase financecompanies, who are the bankers&apos; competitors but operatewithout the conventional liquidity ratios that govern the banks and restrict the credit that they give.F.T.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.4th March, 1 957COPY NO.secret.(57) 564th March, 1957CABINET
