(57)  17th Conclusions, Minute 8),(Signed)    NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S.W.119th March, 1957
148BRITISH USE OP THE SUEZ  CANALNOTE BY. OFFICIALSPART IThe Extent to which we rely on the CanalThe situation under consideration in this Part of the note is one in which British controlled shipping is deprived of the use of the Canal while some other shipping is using it.-The implications of such a situation are quite different fromone in which the Canal is completely closed.Merchant Shj-puing2.     The effects on British merchant shipping would be mostserious.     Though it is difficult to be precise, it is estimatedthat something like three-fifths of the British foreign-goingmerchant fleet was concerned in the use of the Canal before itsclosure last November (British ships represented about29 per cent of all transits during the first half of 1956).The future prosperity Df an important section of British shipping would-be jeopardised, perhaps irreparably, if foreign ships were able to use the Canal while British ships went round the Cape.3.&apos;    The first consequence of such a situation would be thatthe foreign competitors of British Lines would seize theopportunity to establish themselves in trades where british shipping has been entrenched,  and has built up a pre-eminentposition, with an intricate network of services,  over manyyears.      It would be difficult, if not impossible, to restore the position later on.     It is probable that foreign lines would be able to charter tonnage on the market - particularly as the opening of the Canal will automatically increase thesupply of tonnage in relation to world demands - in sufficient quantities to supplant the previous British services.      It is unlikely that the Liner Conferences could, in such circumstances,maintain any previous restrictions on the numbers of sailingsby Lines of the different flags, and in fact the Conferenceswould probably break up.k.      To the extent that British importers preferred to useforeign tonnage on the quickest route, through the Suez Canal,rather than. British tonnage which would go, at greater cost,by the Cape, there would be expenditure in foreign currency onfreights.     Moreover, in most of the trades concerned,  our shipping carries trade between other countries as well as toand from the United Kingdom, and there would be on additionalloss to the balance of payments if foreign shipping supplantedBritish shipping in these trades.     This could probably not be offset save to a small extent by the redeployment of british ships to trades in other parts of the v/orld.Naval Ships5.     The denial of the Suez Canal to the Royal Navy in peacetimewould in the long- terra have the following effects:(a) Impair the flexibility of naval reinforcement of theIndian Ocean (including the Persian Gulf) and the far East.
149(b) Involve the approximate additional expenditureannually of between  1 and  2 millions in providinglogistic support;    this covers oil, naval andvictualling supplies and transport of personnel.(c) Require a revision of the Naval Command arrangements in the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean.6.      The most important of these is the first (29 of her majesty&apos;s ships and 217 Royal Fleet Auxiliaries passed through the Canal during the twelve months ended 3ist July, 1956.dues totalling  k2k929h were paid in respect of these passages).The main striking power of the Royal Navy is at present con-tained in the Home and Mediterranean Fleets and although we havea small Par East Fleet and a very small East Indies Squadron,these forces are insufficient to deal with any serious emergencyeast of Suez without reinforcement from the Mediterranean orHome Fleets.      Cuts in Navy &quot;Votes will aggravate this situation,and the new xolans for possible naval task groups will be seriously affected, if not completely stultified.7.     In the short term a further period without the use of theSues Canal will continue to present inconveniences but conif necessary be accepted, subject to the foregoing paragraph.Dry Cargo Trade8.     Before the closure of the Canal about one-fifth of our imports (by value) and just over one-quarter of our exports andre-exports (by value) passed through the Canal.      This includedvirtually the whole of our dry cargo trade with the Red Seaarea (Aden, Ethiopia and the Sudan), the Persian Gulf countries,the Indian Sub-Continent (India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma) andSouth East Asia (Malaya, Indonesia, Thailand, etc.) and a very-substantial part of the trade with East Africa, Australia andthe Par East (Hong Kong, Japan, China, Philippines, etc.).9.     A large part of United Kingdom supplies of marry importedcommodities is normally routed through the Canal.     All or nearly all of our imports of jute and jute goods, naturalrubber and tea come through the Canal, over half of our importsof wool, cotton yarns and fabrics, zinc ores and lead, and overa quarter of our imports of cotton, hardwood, hides,  skins andleather, carcase meat and dairy products, and vegetable oils.10.    But in the four months during which the Canal has been completely closed there has not been any serious shortfall of import arrivals apart from a brief initial delayj    nor has the shipment of exports been substantially affected.11.    If British ships were unable to use the Canal there wouldbe a strong incentive to switch United Kingdom imports andexprts to foreign ships except possibly for trade with australia.     It is likely that enough foreign ships would be concentrated on the shorter routes via the Canal to carry thewhole of the traffic.      This changeover would cause serious location temporarily but once this was past the effect onour dry cargo trade is not likely to be serious.     In generalour competitive position would probably not be affectedseriously so long as there was no discrimination against british goods passing through the Canal.
150-3-12.      It was estimated in February that, whittle the Canal andthe pipelines were shut, the extra cost to the United Kingdom&apos;balance of? payments would, be at the rate of  200 millions a year.In other words, this would be the extent of the adverse swingbetween a normal year when we can import nearly all Euopre&apos;s requirements from the Middle East and an abnormal one whenabout half has to come from the Western hemisphere.    this figure takes into account all that we recover by way of sales to Western Europe and other foreign countries and everythingwe have to continue to pay in the Middle East, but excludesinward and outward investment by the oil companies.    Inpractice this figure has proved tc be somewhat pessimistic,because Middle East supplieshave been greater than expected.There will be some further improvement from the partial re-opening of the I. P. G.  pipelines.13*      If the normal pattern of oil supplies is to be restored,so far as the United Kingdom&apos;s international trade and balanceof payments are concerned, British flag-tankers must use the canal.    If British flag-tankers did not use the Canal, in theorynormal supplies (but not the norm:1 pattern of supplies) to europe could be fully maintained, assuming full co-operation bythe major tanker-owning companies and their Governments.    Thiswould probably involve using part of the British-flag tonnageround the Cape and part in a continuing lift of Western hemisphere-sphere oil.    This would increase the cost of British Companyoperations, and thus adversely affect the United Kingdom&apos;balance of payments and the short and long term competitive position of the British oil industry.    Moreover, to the extent that tankers sailing under the flag of other main ship-owningcountries as listed in the Annex to this Note were Joining usin not using the Canal, the cost to our ^balance of payments would approach more and more the  200 millions a year on the worst hypothesis envisaged above - namely that the Canal andpipelines remained closed.
151PART IIThe    amount likely to be involved in the payment of? Canal clues11;.    This depends on the number of vessels passing through the canal and the level at whicn the Egyptian Canal Authoritycharges dues.     British-flag vessels used to constitute nearly a third of the total tonnage passing through the Canal and in1955 payments of dues for British-flog vessels amounted toabout  10 millions to which has to be added the dues paid byBritish interests for foreign-flag vessels on charter to them,making    a total of about  12-g- millions.      In addition,    theamount paid to Egypt &quot;by British-flag vessels in ships&apos;disbursements was in the region of  1 millions a year.      Itseems likely that, even if British shipping in general returnsto the Canal, some of the larger British passenger liners willcontinue tc avoid the Canal for some months.      On the otherhand,  tanker traffic may increase.       But a figure of up toabout  13 millions is a rough   measure of probable payments to egypt, if dues remain at the old level, resulting from use ofthe Canal by British and British-chartered shipping on these assumptions.PART IIIDegree of control over-British shipowners15.    British shipowners are usually prepared to take generaladvice from Her Majesty&apos;s Government, but if in the last resort, Her Majesty&apos;s Government wanted them to continuesending their ships round the Gape while their foreign competitors used the Canal, they could not be expected to doso without statutory direction.l6.    A statutory power is available under Defence Regulation 46which, if on policy grounds it were decided to exercise it,would prevent completely the use of the Canal by United Kingdomregistered ships.      This would involve the making of a new order under D.R.i+6 by the Minister of Transport and CivilAviation, and the issue of a general licence under that Orderwith the effect that voyages through the Suez Canal by united Kingdom ships were prohibited.      Such an Order would besubject to negative resolution and it could only be made underthe provisions of the relative Acts &quot;for the defence of anypart    of Her Majesty&apos;s dominions ... or for the maintenance orrestoration of peace and security in any part of the world orfor any measures arising out of a breach or apprehended breach of peace in any part of the world&quot;.      A Colonial EnforcementOrder would be needed to extend this control over Colonial shipsbut it would not, of course, be possible to control Commonwealthregistered ships.17.    The alternative would be to rely on the present currencyrestrictions which render it impossible for British shipownersto make remittances from the United Kingdom to Egypt for either ships&apos; disbursements or Canal dues except into a blocked account.      (But these restrictions would not actuallyprevent the payment of dues to Egypt,  and the passage of our ships through the Canal, if Egypt were prepared to acceptpayments into blocked accounts.)
18.    These currency restrictions also apply to payments of canal dues in respect of foreign ships on time-charter (as distinct from voyage-charter) to British interests (e. g. oil companies)where the British charterer is responsible for payment of dues.This is the only form of control affecting foreign ships.      Thetime-charterer could as a rule (unless the foreign owner had made some special stipulation to the contrary in the charter)direct the route to be taken by the ship on charter, butHer Majesty&apos;s Government have no statutory powers of control,over the voyages of foreign ships.ANNEXWorld Tanker Fleets(Deadweight tonnages)1956British8,094,000Norwegian6,719,000U.S.A.6,479,000LIberian629,000Panamanian3,353,000Swedish1,533,000Netherlands1,506,000Others9,495,000World41,008,000
