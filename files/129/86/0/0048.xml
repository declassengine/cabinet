secret.(57) 98copy N::. *o 316th April, 1957CABINETMALTAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the talks with the Prime Minister of Malta, Mr. Mint off,reached deadlock on 2nd April over economic equivalence.   The PrimeMinister wrote to Mr. Mintoff on 2nd April making it clear that theUnited Kingdom Government^ proposals were as far as they could go.The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs subsequently sent toMr. Mintoff the final form of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments proposals,together with a memorandum explaining them (Annex).2.       Mr. Mintoff has said that he would not be able to recommendthese proposals to his colleagues and would rather resign than accept them.   He has not yet sent us his considered reply.   However, theGovernor reports that he is likely to do so this week and that he willturn our proposals down.   At the same time Mr. Mintoff has beenshowing interest in alternative solutions and has in this connectionrepeated his view that it is unfair to expect the Maltese to accept apermanent constitutional solution while Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfsfinancial proposals involve what he says amounts to a five-year trial period.3.       If we are prepared to face a break with Mr. Mintoff now, then our proposals give us good ground on which to stand firm.   I am certainlyagainst going any further on substance; indeed, on the economic side, wejust cannot budge.   However, we might follow up Mr. Mintoff&apos;s line of thought by agreeing that, as we cannot commit ourselves to underwriteeconomic equivalence, equally we will not at this time expect Malta to bind herself on the political side.   Thus we might offer (subject tocertain amendments of presentation and minor changes of substance)constitutional advance along the lines discussed in London without for thetime being representation at Westminster, and financial assistance onthe lines set out in the Annex.   This new plan would be put foward as the outcome of a more detailed study of the practical issues involved than the malta Round Table Conference was able to undertake, particularly on theeconomic side, but as entirely consistent with their recommendations andas the first steps in a process, the ultimate aim of which for both governments was closer political and economic union.   The two governments would solemnly declare, in a preamble to the new agreement, that theplan represented no change of purpose from the offer of representation of malta in the United Kingdom Parliament if the Maltese people so wishedand the aim of comparable standards of living.   This declaration could begiven the most binding form possible, subject only to the constitutionallimitation of this Parliament not being able to bind its successors.
The declaration would further explain that the plan had the advantage that it would enable any weaknesses in the constitutional or economic arrangements to be corrected during the five-year probationary period and before final union took place,,   After all, it took hundreds of years for the United Kingdom to come together.   At the end of the five years the two Governments would agree to consult together on the workingof the new constitutional arrangements and to co-operate in setting up an independent Commission of the highest standing to review the progress made towards developing the economy and raising the living standards of malta.   In the light of this review and of the Commission^ report, thetwo Governments would consult together (it would probably be necessaryto insist on an election in Malta) with a view to deciding whether the time had finally come to achieve their common purpose, i. e. representationof Malta in the United Kingdom Parliament and ultimate comparableliving standards (Mr. Mintoff demanding a guarantee of these).4.      It is not possible to judge how Mr. Mintoff would react to proposals on these lines but it is difficult to see any satisfactory alternative line for us to pursue with him.   If accepted they could give usfive years of tranqaillity though this would, of course, depend on mr. Mintoff carrying out the spirit of the agreement.   I should be grateful for my colleagues&apos; views.A.L..-B.Colonial Office, S.W.I.16th April, 1957
Memorandum of proposals by United KingdomGovernmen-u for financial assistance to Malta,consequent upon the new constitutional arrangements.1.     The United Kingdom Government have every sympathy with the maltese government in their efforts to improve the standard of living of the maltese people, and the United Kingdom Government fully recognr.se tharfurther financial assistance to this end will be required by Malta for anumber of years.2.     The objective of this memorandum is two -fold.     First it seeks to define the long-term objectives which,, in consequence of the new constitutional relationship, both the United Kingdom and MalteseGovernments -svish to see as the guiding principles which should governwhatever financial arrangements are agreed upon between them.     Secondly,it sets out the financial arrangements which tha United Kingdom Governmentare prepared to make in furtherance of the long-term objectives.I.    OBJECTIVES OF policy.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government approve and support the ultimate aim of the maltese Government, namely, that the Islands should reach an economy anda standard of living comparable to that of the United Kingdom.The two governments agree that this aim will take time to achieveand that in the interim period spacial measures are needed to improve the productivity of the Islands and generally to help the Maltese peopleforward especially on such matters as education and other social benefits.It will be ox-en to the Maltese Government after a period of12 bo 15 years to request that their economy become an integral part ofthat of the United Kingdom when direct and indirect taxation, rates and social contributions would be levied on the United Kingdom pattern.Both governments agree that any suoh change would only be appropriatewhen the productivity drive has succeeded in bringing the economy of Malta to a levsl which, taking account of all relevant factors, is comparable to that of the United Kingdom,     The Maltese Governmenb recognises theobligation of tho Maltese people to make sustained efforts to achieve this aim.4.     The Maltese Government will draw up plans aimed at increasing the productivity, and the living standards and expanding the national income of Malta.     In drawing up these plans, account will be taken of the need:-(a) to diversify the economy and in particular to create opportunities for. industrial development, including tourism, designed to make possible the economic viability of the Islands, and to reduceits dependence on United Kingdom contributions;(b) to raise the standard of education, health and social welfare;(c) to maintain full employment;(d) to provide positive incentives to emigration.II.   FMflNOIAL iUffiANGKMSNTS5.     As a first step towards the attainment of the objectives of policy set cut in Section I above, and bearing in mind the need to increase the productivity and develop the economy of the Islands in order to enable/social
social services and living standards to be progressively increased, thefollowing financial arrangements for a capital programme and for recurrent expenditure will apply to the first five years after the change inconst5.tutional stabus:(i) Capital programme.     The United Kingdom Governmeno&apos;s contribution to the capital development programme shall be approximately -525 million of v/h:ch notmore than around 55 million shall be issued ir any one year.     this assistance will be brought to account by the Maltese Government as partof the revenues of Malta.7.     The capital budget will consist of all development works or projects,including all war damage end reconstruction works and projects appropriate to the war damage and reconstruction graut under the Malta (Reconstruction)Act 194-7.8.     During this period the fixed contributicn to capital developmentmade by the United Kingdom Government will consist of:-(a) the balance of the war damage grant in the Consolidated RevenueFund of the Government of the United Kingdom uiitil this grantis exhausted, amounting to   at ;(b)a sum^equivalent to the balance of the Colonial Development and welfare allocation made to Malta amounting to  at(c) a sum sufficient to make good the difference between the totalof (a) and (b) and the amount of the aggregate contribution forthe period (i,o, the  25 million mentioned in paragraph 6 above)9.     The United Kingdom Government will use its good offices to assist the maltese Government in the establishment in Malta of industrial firms inorder to increase Maltese productivity ai.d thus provide the economic basis for a steady increase in Maltese living standards.(ii) Recurrent Expenditure10.   The recurrent budget will consist of all governmental services not appropriate to the capital budget.     The United Kingdom Government share the view of the Maltese Government as to the importance of the developmentof Malta&apos;s social services, especially education and health.     Moreover,the United Kingdom Government recognise that this programme will not show-much return in the early years;   and they are consequently anxious to givecontinued financial hjlp on an assured basis.11.   The United Kingdom Government therefore undertake to make an annual-contribution towards the Maltese recurrent budget for the first five years,calculated as follows:In regard to the Education, Health and Social   el fare Servicesof the Maltese Government, insofar as they are regarded by both governments as coming within the field of social services, theUnited Kingdom Government will contribute:(i) in respect of Education, one-third of the actual annualrecurrent cost of the Education Service (OR, 25/a cf thetotal actual recurrent expenditure nn the Education Serviceup to 51 million and 5CJ&apos;o of any actual recurrent expenditureon that Service in excess of  1 million).
(ii) in rojpect of the Health and Social Welfare Services otherthan Education, 25,0 of the actual recurrent cost.Pravided that:(1) the payment by the United Kingdom Government under sub-paragraph (i) and (ii) above taken together shall besubject to a minimum annual payment of  900,000;    and(f1.) the Maltese Government bears the full cost of the remainder of the recurrent budget.(iii) General Proy.-siOi.-s12,   The Unit id Kiugdom Go\ernmenb recognise that any drastic change in imperial Defence policy afecting Malta might alter considerably thebasis on which a capital expenditure plan was drawn up and the l.wel ofemployment       Malta,     In such circumstances the United Kingdom Governmentwould bo willing to review the position.     In particular, if Idconsequence of such a change in Imperial J defence policy, th-s level ofunemployment in Malta, should reach and, for six months, remain at a higher level.than the rate of unemployment in the United Kin^d^m at the time,the United Kingdom Government would be willing to ass-st the maltese government ?n taking remedial measures to be agreed.13.   The Government of Malta will secure the agreement of theUnited Kingdom before raising ihoney by loan or by temporary advances above a level of temporary advances reached at any time in the 12 months ended31st March, I 958.12f,   The United Kingdom Parliament will be furnished annually with theaudited accounts of the Maltese Government.III.      &amp;E?0INTMENT OF a COMMISSION15.   The two Governments agree that, towards the end of the first fiveyear pedLod, an independent Commission sb&apos;3.11 be set up to review theprogress made in Malta, under the arrangements set out a.bcve?  towards theultimate aim of reaching an economy and a standard of living comparable to that of the United Kingdom.     In particular it will be the task of theCommission to examine the progress achieved, as a result of the jointefforts of the two Governments, in increasing the productivity and developing the economy of the Islands;    to consider what further progressmay be possible in these respects;   and in the light of their assessmentto advise the two Governments on what further measures or alternative arrangements it might be necessary and desirable to adopt, bearing in mind the objec+ives cf policy as defined in Section I of this Memorandum.Note.     The contributory national insurance schemes of Malta and theUnited Kingdom and Northern Ireland are at present set up on adifferent basis,     Nonetheless should the Maltese Government so wishHer Majjsty&apos;s Government are very roady to consider with the maltese government the implications of bringing the Maltese scheme into chesame relationship as that of Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.co/5227/57
MEMORANDUM ON HER MAJESTY &apos;S   GOVERNMENTS PROPOSALSFOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO MALTAThe Maltese Government contend that Her Majesty&apos;s Government donot accept the economic consequences which flow logically from &quot;thepolitical act of union between Malta and the United Kingdom&quot;.Her Majesty&apos;s Government knowing that their economic proposals flowfromfee acceptance of union cannot agree this contention.2.      The Round Table Conference ended its Report with the words &quot;webelieve that the people of Malta are entitled to a special road to political equality, and that that road should &quot;be, if they so choose,representation at Westminster.&quot;3.      The Conference did not consider it within their Terms of Referenceto examine in detail and. make specific recommendations on the lines ofeconomic development in Malta.    They did, however, make some general observations on the important subject of future United Kingdom aid.In particular, they referred to the need to promote productive develop-ment in Malta and to take care that increases in social expenditure didnot run ahead of the Maltese people&apos;s ability to support such expendi-ture in the longer term from their own resources.    The Conferencereccy.:iriended that a series of development plans designed to raiseproductivity and expand the national income &quot;be planned and carried out,and they emphasized the words agreed by both the Maltese and british representative at the June 1955 talks that &quot;the degree of success-attained will depend on the hard work and self-discipline of the Maltese people, and on the Maltese Government and people making the best possible contribution from their own resources.&quot;h.      The Conference had the advantage of hearing the evidence of the maltese Prime Minister and his economic advisers, and-considerablestress was laid in evidence they gave on the importance of raisingproductivity in order that Malta should no longer depend to such alarge extent on the expenditure of United Kingdom Defence Departments.The need for wage restraint, and for relating the increased standard ofliving not only to the amount of aid.from United Kingdom but to increased productivity, was also recognised by the representatives ofthe General Workers Union.5.      As the Maltese Government is aware, Her Majesty&apos;s government thought that the references in the Economic section of the MalteseReferendum proposals to the subject of equivalence with british standards went perilously near to conveying a wrong impression of whatthe Round Table Conference had recommended and what Her Majesty&apos;sGevernment were prepared to accept.    It was made quite clear inexchanges at the time that Her Majesty&apos;s Government were not committed to the Maltese interpreation of the economic aspects of integration.Further, the Secretary of State said in the debate on the 26th March,1956, that equivalence was an objective which could only be attainedat the end of a lf-ng period by a gradual process, and would be dependant upon, among other things, the success of economic development in Malta.6.      In recent months there have been a series of talks between her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Maltese Government with a view to working out in detail not only the Constitutional arrangements(representation at Westminster but otherwise self-government save inthe retained fields of Defence and Foreign Affairs, etc.) but also thefinancial help Her Majesty&apos;s Government might provide consequent on them.7.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government have in this connection gone a 0..ood dealfurther than anything envisaged at the time of the Round Table/Conference,
Conference, in their willingness to provide generous assistance tothe Maltese -people in their efforts towards the ultimate aim of an economy and standard of living comparable to those of the UnitedKingdom.8.      It will be seen from the accompanying document that the objectives include Her Majesty&apos;s Government1s approval and supportof the ultimate aim of the Maltese Government-    and further her majesty&apos;s Government have agreed that &quot;it will be open to the maltese government at any time after a period of 12 to 15 years to vequestthat their economy become an integral part of that of the UnitedKingdom, when direct and indirect taxation, rates and socialcontributions would be levied on the United Kingdom pattern.&quot;9.      For the first five years, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed(i) to provide a generoi^s   grant for the capital development programme;(ii) t-&apos;. meet 25% of the cost of all agreed social services with some-thing additional on education, subject to a minimum annual contribution of  900..000 a year.    This, is a unique offer madein view of the Objectives of Policy and is unlimited in the sense that its ceiling is governed only by the contribution&apos; the maltese people themselves make to such services.    Moreover,the additional assistance proposed for education recognises the special importance of education in raising the standard ofliving of the Maltese people;    and(iii) lastly and most important, to review the position in the eventof any drastic change in Imperial Defence policy affectingemployment in Malta and to assist the Maltese Government intaking remedial measures to be agreed.    This obligation againis unique and is not paralleled in any part of the UnitedKingdom.    Such an important undertaking could only be givenin the light of Malta&apos;s special fortress position and as an earnest of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments attachment to the objectives of Policy consequent on the new constitutional proposals.10.    The Maltese Prime Minister, while recognising the generosity ofthese proposals, feels that they do not meet the point of principle which he wishes to establish, namely that the representation of Maltain the United Kingdom Parliament must be accompanied by a guarantee-that comparable living standards will be provided for the Maltese people within a period of years, whatever the outcome of efforts to expand the economy of Malta might be.11.    At first sight, it might appear reasonable to propose thatcomparable standards should, to whatever extent necessary, be providedby the U.K. taxpayer when the rates of direct and indirect taxation in malta are raised to those in the United Kingdom.    But on examinationthe Maltese Government&apos;s proposals will be found to involve the UnitedKingdom&apos;s meeting, in addition to the contributions to capital develop-ment and recurrent expenditure described in paragraph 9 above, thetotal deficit on the recurrent budget of Malta - an unknown liability.Much of this deficit would arise from increases in Government wagesand salaries.    As half to two-thirds of the working population in malta are employed by the Maltese Government or the Service Departments,increases in wages which the U.K. would be paying, directly or indirectly, might enable the Maltese Government to increase its taxrates in time to the United Kingdom levels.    But that would not be a sound or reasonable basis for claiming that Malta had reached economicequivalence and was thus entitled to demand economic integration.
12.    In rejecting this proposal, Her Majesty&apos;s Government are supported&quot;by the words of the Round Table Conference in paragraphs 59 and ol oftheir Report.    Pier Majesty&apos;s Government believe in the fundamental importance of the principle that Malta&apos;s progress towards the ultimate aim should depend principally on the success of her productivity drive.It is apparent however that this term &quot;productivity drive&quot; is ppen tomisund.erstanding.    Productivity is not measures\required  only by goods produced by the private sector but also includes all kinds of services.    Forexample, economic work in the dockyards is productivity, as are allthe earnings arising from the expenditure of the troops or of tourists.Her Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that an artificial wage level would hinder if not prevent any soundly based development of the island&apos;s own resources.13.    What is said in paragraphs 11 and 12 above a-plies with equalforce to any artificial raising of social service standards.    Thiswould inevitably distort the economy of the Islands and seriouslyimpede the productivity drive.1U.    In -a last effort to resolve the difference    of view between thetwo sides, H.M.G. proposed, the setting up of a Commission as described in Section III of the accompanying document.    It is feltthat this proposal for an independent Commission of the higheststanding should remove any suggestion.that either Government was seeking to avoid the practical consequences of endorsing the&quot;objectives of policy&quot; as set out in Section I of the accompanyingdocument, which includes the approval and support of the ultimateaid of the Maltese Government, namely, that Malta should reach an economy and a standard of living comparable to that of the UnitedKingdom.15.    It is the conviction of Her Majesty&apos;s Government that theproposals described in this memorandum are appropriate to a peoplewhom the United Kingdom is ready to welcome politically as one withitselfs while leaving them the widest possible measure of self-government.C r/3823/57
