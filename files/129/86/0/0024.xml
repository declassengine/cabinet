81(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET0C 7Co(57) 74 COPY NO, \-r^-21st March, 1957CABINETBRITISH EVACUEES FROM egypt memorandum by the Home secretary and Lord Privy seal at their meeting on 12th March (C.C.(57) 18th Conclusions,Minute 6) the Cabinet invited me to arrange for a committee of officials to classify the various types of financial and commercialclaims against Egypt and to consider the possibility of making suitableadvances against established claims by private individuals in this category.   I circulate for my colleagues consideration a report whichhas been prepared by a committee of officials representing the HomeOffice, Foreign Office, Treasury and Board of Trade.R. A. o.Home Office, S.W.1.21st March, 1957
182PAYMENT OF ADVANCES AGAINST ASSETS OF&quot;       BRITISH EVACUEES FROM EGYPTReport of a Committee of OfficialsClassification of claims1. Approximately 2,000 forms have been sent out by the ForeignOffice to private individuals and business concerns for the submission of statements regarding property and assets in Egypt,   So far just over400 have been returned.   In addition, the British Chamber of Commerceof Egypt has sent out 500 forms to refugees and evacuees, invitingthem to record details of their property in Egypt, for communication to the Foreign Office.   There is no doubt some overlapping, but therewill probably be 200 or 300 additional statements to be received through this channel.   There are also approximately 450 statements from theindividual members of the Suez contractors st^-ff, which will besubmitted to the Foreign Office through the War Office.   New cases arearising at the rate of 60-70 per week.Over 500 claims in respect of goods supplied to or ordered by Egypt by United Kingdom exporters have also been received.Details of assets are recorded in respect of personal propertyunder the following headings:  Land;   Buildings; Furniture and PersonalEffects;   Vehicles;   Bank Balances:  Articles deposited at banks for safecustody; Insurance policies:  Indemnities and staff provident funds;Egyptian Government pensions;   Personal securities.   And, for businessconcerned, under:   Land;   Buildings;   Plant and machinery:   stocks ofgoods;  Vehicles;   Furniture;   Bank balances:   Investments or securities;Estimated value of the goodwill of the business;   Other assets.2. This information is tabulated and running totals of the totalamounts under the individual headings are maintained.   No attempthas so far been made to classify according to the total value of the assets listed.   No attempt is made to evaluate statements submitted,and documents are not required to be submitted.Tabulation has only just begun, and by 18th March details of only 55 statements had been tabulated.   It is hoped that in future it willbe possible to deal with approximately 60 per day; on that basis itwould take between six and seven weeks to deal with those forms whichhave been sent out, and which may be expected to be returned fairly soon.It should be possible in approximately two weeks to make a rough estimate of the total value of assets claimed to have been left inEgypt on the basis of statements recorded so far, and of the value under each of the headings listed above for the two classes of private individuals and business interests.   On the same basis, it might bepossible to arrive at a rough approximation of the number of claimsabove and below any particular figure, and the sums involved, butspecial arrangements would be necessary.Claims from United Kingdom exporters amount to approximPtely 8.4 millions, of which  4.7 millions is in respect of goods not yetshipped, and  1.1 millions in respect of guarantees and tender deposits.
1833. The Committee do not feel that it is possible to work out thedetails of any scheme for the payment of advances against assets until more information is available about the extent and nature of privateassets in Egypt.4. There are, in any event, many serious objections in principleagainst any such scheme.   The most serious objection to any decisionto make advances to British subjects or commercial firms from egypt would be that such action would breach a well-established principlethat advances are not ma.de when British citizens have outstandingclaims for property confiscation or nationalisation against foreign government.   The basic reason for this principle is that there can never be any guarantee that the assets against which advances might bemade will be returned to their owners or compensation paid for them.By breaching this principle a most dangerous precedent would be created, the repercussions of which cannot be estimated with precisionbut might constitute a very heavy burden on the Exchequer.   difficulty would arise at once, for example, ever the Baltic States assets held inthe United Kingdom.5. A decision to make advances against assets might alsoprejudice the eventual negotiations with the Egyptian Government forthe restitution of property which has been sequestrated, and would also make it difficult for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to avoid having to makepayment up to the full value of property, both of individuals and commercial firms, which has been sequestrated, if the egyptian government do not in fact make restitution.6. A decision to pay advances to private individuals or commercialfirms might add considerably to the difficulties already encountered inthe negotiations with the Sudanese Government over their claim againstthe blocked Egyptian balances, which amount to  20 millions.   This sumis regarded by the Sudan as its rightful share of the Egyptian balancesand is sought urgently for use as backing for the new Sudanese currencywhich is about to be issued.   This Sudanese request is at present underconsideration by Ministers.7. There are also considerable practical difficulties about theoperation of any scheme for the payment of advances against assets.In the first place, it would be extremely difficult to resist pressure from commercial firms if advances were made to private individuals.   Bothcategories have been invited to register their assets with the ForeignOffice, and if it were decided to make advances to individuals therewould undoubtedly be pressure from commercial firms for similaradvances, for example from those firms who are unable, for various reasons, to obtain payment for goods which they have shipped to Egypt.It would no longer be possible to justify differential treatment for private individuals on the basis of personal hardship.8. It is clear that a scheme for the payment of advances could notbe operated by the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board, which has beenestablished as a charitable trust for the relief of need.   The payment of advances to individuals on the basis of their assets in Egypt would notbe within the functions of the Board, and the Board is not properlyconstituted to undertake this task.   The Committee were agreed that itwould be necessary to establish a new organisation for the purpose of
184making advances.   Such an organisation would need to be staffed withaccountants, preferably with experience in Egypt, and with persons witha knowledge of Egyptian law.   Since the number of individualsregistering their assets with the Foreign Office is likely to be between,000 and 3,000, an organisation of considerable size and complexitywould have to be established if payments were to be made at allpromptly.9. It would usually be impossible to establish the accuracy of the individuals&apos; statements of their assets in Egypto   Few of them have beenable to bring any documents from Egypt which would afford proof oftheir assets, and in many cases the assets were in intangible forms, suchas the goodwill of businesses, which would be extremely difficult to evaluate.10.        Complications would also arise in regard to the relation betweenadvances made against assets and grants made by the Anglo-egyptian resettlement Board for the purpose of resettlement.   These grants,which under the proposals recently approved by the Cabinet might amount to about  1,000 for a family, and even larger sums in special cases, are to be made by way of direct grant without any question of repayment.   If a new organisation were set up which would make advanceson an undertaking to repay them, it would lead to a disparity of treatment between individuals which might well give rise to public criticism.11.        It would be necessary to provide for the expenses of the new organisation to be borne on some Department&apos;s Vote.   The responsi-bilityof the Home Secretary in regard to British evacuees from Egyptis restricted to the supervision of the arrangements for their resettle-ment, and the Committee do not consider that it would be appropriate forthe expense of paying advances against assets in Egypt to be borne onthe Home Office Vote.   Although the classification of assets is atpresent being undertaken by the Foreign Office, the administration bythe Foreign Office of a scheme for the payment of advances againstassets, where no settlement has been negotiated and there is no firmprospect of any recovery of these assets, would be an entirely new departure.Conclusion.12.        The Committee appreciate that there is considerable pressure from those British subjects who are unable to gain access to their assets, but they do not feel able to advise Ministers that it would bepossible to institute any system for paying advances on the basis ofthese assets which could be satisfactorily administered and would be free from the objections of principle set out above.-3-
