secret.(57) 8330th March, 1957CABINETNATIONALISED industries memorandum by the Minister of transport and Civil aviation the Minister of Fower&apos;s proposals in C.(57) 82 on the financing of the nationalised industries raise the fundamental issue whether theGovernment are to continue to hold price levels as far as is practicable(i. e. to limit price increases to the amounts required to cover currentincreases in costs after allowing for benefits from increased productivity and efficiency) or whether we are now finally to abandon a policy of price restraint.2.       If the proposals of the Minister of Power are accepted, theGovernment will be aggravating increases in prices by introducingelements   of cost which represent a change in the basis of the provisionfor depreciation and an attempt to recover over a short period pastrevenue losses.   Such a change in policy will be likely to arouse muchopposition, particularly at the present time.   I also suggest that in thecase of nationalised industries which hold something close to a monopolywe should err if at all on the side of moderation in charges.3.       My immediate concern, of course, is with the effect upon theBritish Transport Commission if the policy advocated by the Minister of power is adopted.   The Commission have been following a policy of price restraint with the Governments backing, which was publicly givenin the recent White Paper &quot;Proposals for the Railways&quot;  (Cmd. 9880).   Itis true that to some extent this restraint is forced upon them by competition from road transport - competition fostered by Government policy.4.       In contrast the fuel and power industries are largely monopolyundertakings with very limited competition, and are accordingly able to adjust their charges without serious risk of losing trade.5.       If the Commission were to adopt, in so far as they are able, thepolicy now proposed for coal, electricity and gas, they would have to try to find additional revenue to meet the extra charge for depreciation,estimated in 1955 at  20 millions. They would also have to find a further 14 millions to cover the recent wage increases on British Railways andanother  6 millions to meet the. proposed increase in the price of coalalone.   These three items amount to  40 millions.   It is out of thequestion that the railways should in addition try to follow coal in making provision to wipe out their current and accumulated deficits.COPY NO.
6.       The Commission could probably increase their charges to raisethe  40 millions of additional revenue indicated above, but this wouldmean substantial increases on traffic generally (freight and passenger)coupled with very heavy increases on selected traffics, such as coal and other minerals, which are more or less tied to rail.   For example,it might be necessary to increase by 50 per cent the present rate of charge for certain coal traffic and to seek authority to double thepresent maximum rate per mile for passenger travel.   Any attempt toraise additional revenue of this magnitude would have to be publiclyacknowledged as a departure from the present declared policy of price restraint.7.      At present, in conformity with the policy forecast in the white paper the Commission are proposing to increase as soon as practicablesome freight and passenger charges (British Railways and london transport) to recover only the additional direct costs which have fallenon them.8.       The Commission^ general intentions are as follows -(a) On passenger fares they propose at once to lodge with theTransport Tribunal an application to enable them to continuethe present 3d. minimum fare and to increase certain otherordinary fares in London, and to increase early morning andseason ticket fares both in London and in the Provinces.   Ifthey obtain this authority the 3d. minimum would continue whenthe additional fuel tax disappears (this has already been fore-shadowed by the London Transport Executive), but the otherincreases would not be imposed before the autumn; when theywould also increase ordinary second class fares on british railways from 1. 88d. per mile to Zd. per mile, for which they already have authority.(b) As to rail freight, the new Charges Scheme will come into force on 1st July and the Commission propose then to increasecharges wherever commercially practicable.   They also propose to lodge an application with the Tribunal for anincrease in the maximum charges.(c) For docks and inland waterways they will be applying to me at anearly date for an increase of 5 per cent under Section 82 ofthe Transport Act, 1947.I should be glad to have the views of my colleagues as to the timing ofthese proposals, especially the lodging of the passenger applicationreferred to in (a).9.       Unless quite different policies are to be followed for differentnationalised industries, it seems desirable that some kind of middle,course should be taken by the coal, electricity and gas industries whichwould then not go as far as proposed in the Minister of Power&apos;smemorandum.   This would at least avoid too steep an ascent from theprice plateau.H.W.Ministry of Transport and civil Aviation, W.1,29th March, 1957
