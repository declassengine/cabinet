Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 556th March, 1957CABINETTHE SUEZ CANAL CONVENTION OF 1888Memorandum by the Attorney-general on 29th January the Cabinet invited me to submit the considered opinion ofthe Law Officers on the question whether, by invading and occupying Port Said,the United Kingdom was in breach of Articles IV and V of the Suez CanalConvention of 1888 and, if so, how its right of free passage through the Canalmight be affected (C.C. (57) 4th Conclusions, Minute 1).2. At my request the issues were submitted to me by the Legal Adviser to theForeign Office in an informal Case for our Opinion. I attach, as an Annex to thisMemorandum, a copy of my reply.R. E. M.-B.Law Officers&apos; Department, W.C. 2,5th March, 1957.51306
,       , - i hi . .     - - .   - 5/A Marc/?, 7957.,^;&apos;,...;;:r; ,.&apos;,SUEZ-CANAL.:The Solicitor-General and I have now considered the letter of the21st February in which we were asked to advise on the following questions:-.....;!     I.-Was the military action taken by the United Kingdom against Egypt; between October 31 and November 7, 1956, a breach of Article IV or Vor any other Article of the 1888 Suez Canal Convention?II-Was Egyptian military action in Port Said and the region of the suez canal a breach of Article IV or V or any other Article of the 1888Suez Canal Convention?1 III.-Was the blocking of the Suez Canal by Egypt a breach of the 1888 Suez, &apos; Canal Convention?IV. If the answer to Question I is in the affirmative,(1) Has Egypt the right either to terminate the application of the1888 Convention so far as she is concerned, with respect to the:  United Kingdom, or, without purporting to do that, to refuse to accord to British ships the right of free passage through theV-i Suez Canal?,&quot;&apos;.! (2) Alternatively, can it be argued that even if Egypt has the right to terminate the application of the Convention, so far as she isi;i. concerned, with respect to the United Kingdom, the general 1 regime of the Convention would still operate to prevent herrefusing passage to British (as to any other) ships?2. It appears to us to be clear beyond argument that the United Kingdom&apos;attack on&apos; Egypt constituted a breach of the duty, undertaken by Article I of theConvention, &quot; not in any way to interfere with the free use of the Canal, in timeof war as in time of peace.&quot; The attack could not, in our opinion, be justified onthe ground that it was; required for the protection of the Canal against the effects6f!the conflict between Egypt and Israel, because the defence of the Canal isentrusted by Article IX of the Convention itself to Egypt.3. It is not therefore strictly necessary for us to consider whether the attack was in breach of either Article IV or Article V of the Convention but, as we haveno doubt about the question, it seems desirable that we should state our views.Article IV prohibits, so far as it is relevant in this context, any &quot; act of hostility .... committed in the Canal and its ports of access, as well as withina radius of 3 marine miles from those ports.&quot; Having regard to the fact thatthe principal object of the Convention is to guarantee the free use of the Canal,we are of the opinion that Article IV is applicable in both war and peace and therecannot, we think, be any doubt that the military action, both in Port Said and during the subsequent advance along the Canal, constituted a breach of it.Article V, which prohibits the embarkation and disembarkation of troops inthe Canal and its ports in wartime, does not appear to us to apply to the situationwhich existed between October 31 and November 7. It applies, in our view, toa situation like that which existed during the greater part of the war of 1939-45,when Egyptian territory was a theatre of war, but Egypt herself was not abelligerent. It does not appear to us that the reference in the Article to thedisembarkation of troops is apt to describe an assault landing from sea and air.It is not therefore necessary to consider whether the armed conflict with Egyptamounted to war in international law and we prefer to express no opinion on thepoint.4. The second and third questions put to us can, we think, be considered together. The effect of Articles X and XI is that the obligations imposed by article IV do not interfere with those measures which Egypt &quot; might find itSir Gerald Fitzmaurice, K.C.M.G.,Foreign Office, S.W. 1.
necessary to take for securing by [her] own forces the defence of Egypt&quot; so longas they do not interfere with the free use of the Canal. Measures taken by Egypt-for securing by her own forces the defence of Egypt which did not interfere withthe free use of the Canal were lawful although they infringed Article IV. any measure taken by Egypt which interfered with the free use of the Canal (and the blocking of the Canal clearly did so) constituted a breach of the Convention,    i :5. In our view the Convention is, as its preamble recites, designed &quot; toestablish, by a Conventional Act, a definite system designed to guarantee at all times, and for all the Powers, the free use of the Suez Maritime Canal, and thus to complete the system under which the navigation of this Canal has been placed by the Firman of ... . the 22nd February, 1866 .... sanctioning the concessions &quot;granted to the Suez Canal Company. The salient features of the regime governing the Canal were established, not only before the Convention came into force in1904, but even before it was signed in 1888 and the history of both the Canal andthe Convention itself clearly shows that the object of the Convention wasto guarantee a right of passage that was already established and recognised.In other words, the Convention is a treaty of guarantee, which is declaratoryof the right of free passage, but of itself confers no new rights on the parties.It follows, therefore, that the breach by the United Kingdom of Articles Iand IV did not confer on Egypt any right to refuse to accord to British ships theright of free passage through the Suez Canal, for that right derives not from theConvention, but from the dedication of the Canal as an international waterway bythe Firman of 1866, confirming Article 14 of the Concession of 1856. As theConvention is a treaty of collective guarantee, in our view Egypt is not entitledto terminate it so far as it relates to the United Kingdom. The only result of suchtermination, if it could be effected, would be to release the United Kingdom fromits obligations under the Convention.The second part of the fourth question put to us does not therefore arise.6.  The answers to the questions put to us may be summarised as follows :.-L-Yes: Articles I and IV.II. In respect of Article I, Yes; in respect of Article IV, Yes, except in so far;as the measures taken in the defence of Egypt did, not interfere with thefree use of the Canal; in respect of Article V, No.III.-Yes.IV.-(1) No.(2) Does not therefore arise.REGINALD MANNINGHAM-BULLER;
