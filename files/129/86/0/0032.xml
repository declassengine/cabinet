COPY NO. &apos;    yCABINETFUEL AND POWER industries memorandum by the Minister of Fov/e?On 27th March the Economic Policy Committee discussed prices and the provision of capital finance for the fuel and power industries and invited me to circulate to the Cabinet a paper on this subject (E.A.(57)7th Meeting, Item 2).oECRiir TC.(57) 8230th March, 19572.      The fuel and power industries face the need for a continuing high level of capital investment to meet the progressively increasing require-ments of energy.3.      The investment programmes of the coal, gas and electricity industries have been subjected to careful scrutiny by officials of myMinistry and by the Treasury and as a result have been reduced where possible.    In my judgment they cannot safely be reduced further.4.      To some extent these investment programmes can be financed bythe industries on their present basis of operation, but the balance isto be provided by Exchequer advances.5.      The proposals of the industries for 1957-58 are as follows:-Investment Exchequer Borrowings&quot;E millions   millions1957-58  (1956-57)       1957-58        (1956-57)Coal 107 (96) 75 (39)Gas 59 (52) 29 (24)Electricity 229 (205) 152 (148)6.      The estimates of borrowings rest on the assumptions thatdepreciation will continue to be charged on historical costs and that theindustries are required only to balance their operating costs.7.      The effects of the price stabilisation policies adopted last yearby the three industries have also to be taken into account.    operating costs have been increasing.     In particular, wages were advanced inFebruary, 1956 by some 8 per cent and there is now a further advance of5 per cent which is presently being conceded and must be taken intoaccount.8.      If the Exchequer is to be relieved from making good, by means of advances, (a) the current deficits that arise from wage and other operatingcost increases, and (b) the failure of these nationalised industries to
cover maintenance, replacement and normal improvement of capitalassets, it is clear that they should be allowed to advance the prices oftheir products to cover costs under both these heads.9.      I have examined the position with the leaders of these industrieswho accept the desirability of financing an appropriate increasedproportion of their capital expenditure and covering increased costs outof their revenue.10.    I summarise the conclusions of this examination under each industry as followst-(a)  CoalThere was an increase of 8 per cent on pithead prices in June, 1956and it was expected that this would result in a surplus of  6^- millions in1957.The Board now estimate that wage advances, last year and this,and other increased costs will result in a deficit of  25 millions in 1957and  64 millions in 1958.Prices cannot be increased before July, 1957, so that to bring the accounts into balance an increase of 5s. lOd. per ton in the pithead priceof coal would be needed.If these sums are not found from revenues they will have to bemet by Exchequer advances and the accumulated deficit (now standing at about  20 millions) on the Eoard&apos;s books will increase accordingly.In addition to meeting wage increases the Board would aim atreducing their capital account borrowings from the Exchequer by 15 millions during the year 1957-58.To achieve this a further increase in price of an additional 2s. perton would be required on 1st July next.The pithead price would thus be increased by a total of 7s. 10d.per ton or by about 10 per cent.The total relief to the Exchequer would be about  80 millions ina full year, of which  15 millions would represent the further self-financing of capital expenditure.(b)    ElectricityAn increase of this order in the price of coal would add rather more than  10 millions to generating costs, also, the recent wage increases will call for some  5 millions a year.     These two items together willrequire an increase of just over 4 per cent in electricity tariffs.In addition the Central Electricity Authority are prepared toreduce their borrowings from the Exchequer on capital account in1957-58 by some  25 millions- 35 millions.    My own conclusion is thatthe Central Authority should be asked to reduce their borrowings by 30 millions, which would require an increase in their revenue of  per cent.
The total effect of these proposals on electricity, therefore, isto require an increase in revenue of 11 per cent.(c)  GasA coal price increase affects gas more severely than electricitybecause coal costs are higher for gas.    An increase in coal prices ofthe order proposed would increase the gas industry s costs by 10 millions and put up gas prices on average by 3&quot;! per cent,    Therecent wage increase will raise the figure of cost to  13 millions and theprice increase to just over 4 per cent.The competitive position of the gas industry is such that I feelthat they should not be asked to make so big a reduction as electricity intheir borrowings on capital account, and I would suggest a reduction of 3 millions involving an additional price increase of about 1 per cent.The total gas price increase would then be of the order of 5 per cent.11. The broad effect of the proposals in this paper in a full year maybe summarised as follows:-  millionsIncreased revenue required tomeet increased costsCoal 64Gas 13Electricity 1592Increased revenue required toreduce Capital Account Borrowing .from the ExchequerCoal 15Gas 3Electricity 304812.     I append a summary showing the broad effect of these proposals on the current level of prices.13. It will be seen that the total effect on the cost of living after allowing for these increases to work their way right through the economy will be about 0. 7 per cent.     Of this the advances due to increased costsaccount for 0a4 per cent and the advances due to reduction of borrowingson capital account 0. 3 per cent.14.    I am aware of the arguments that can be advanced that theseproposals add to the inflationary pressures.    The alternative is to find the money by Exchequer borrowing.    This would seem to me no lessinflationary - and moreover the kind of inflation of which there is mostcriticism, viz. , the kind for which the Government is directly responsible.3-
15.    It appears a straight issue between finding the money by subsidyfrom the Exchequer or by increased revenues from consumers.16. If it is thought that prices must in any event be raised to coverincreased costs, I suggest that we should take the opportunity to ease theburden on the Exchequer by making a small addition to the price increasein order to provide for a greater degree of self-financing on capital account.17.    The proposals in this paper do not cover the two ScottishElectricity Hoards.    The Secretary of State has pointed out to theEconomic Policy Committee that (i) the South of Scotland electricity board need not be asked to increase their prices in order to provide agreater degree of self-financing, and (ii) that the North of ScotlandHydro-Electricity Board is in a special position in that it is financingnew development and not replacing productive capacity.     For these reasons he considers, and I agree, that the Scottish Electricity Boardscan properly be excluded from the proposals in this paper.M.Ministry of Power, S. W. 1.29th March, 1957.
