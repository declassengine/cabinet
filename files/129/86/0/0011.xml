IMPORTS OF COTTONMemorandum by the Economic Policy CommitteeOn 6th March, the Economic Policy Committee discussedimports of cotton textiles from India, Pakistan and Hong Kong and decided that the present position should be reported to the Cabinet(E.A.(57) 5th Meeting, Item l).2.      Imports of cotton textiles have increased sharply in recentyears, and greatly impaired the confidence of the United kingdom industry.    A table showing these imports over the past five years is annexed.     In July, 1956, Sir Anthony Eden took the initiative and,after consulting the Prime Minister of India, Mr. Nehru, publiclysuggested that discussions between the Lancashire and Indian textile industries might prove useful.    The Lancashire industry took up this suggestion;  they had talks with Indian industrialists in the autumn and a mission from Lancashire under Sir Cuthbert Clegg visited Indiaand Hong Kong in January.3.      The mission secured the agreement of the Indian industry,with the knowledge and approval of the Government of India, to Indianexports to the United Kingdom being restricted, for the next threeyears, at the 1956 level, subject to two conditions.    These were, first,that Indian exports should be controlled in the United Kingdom;  and second, that arrangements on the same basis should be made withPakistan and Hong Kong.     While the mission did not succeed in negotiating an agreement with the Hong Kong industry, they made some progress;   and the Hong Kong manufacturers have since indicated thatthey might be willing to make an agreement, provided that similar arrangements are made with the Pakistan industry.    They have,however, made it clear that the limitation of Hong Kong&apos;s exports also would need to be controlled by the United Kingdom.4.      The industry wish to send out a mission to Pakistan to begindiscussions on 25th March.     If the mission is successful in Karachi,it will go on to Hong Kong.    Negotiations with Pakistan will be difficult,for Fakistan exports of cotton textiles to the United Kingdom are growingvery rapidly.    They rose from almost nothing in 1955 to nearly8million square yards in 1956.    It is possible that the success of theoperation may break down over Pakistan, as the expanding Pakistanindustry will not accept restriction to the level of their 1956 exports:they may insist on a figure between 20 and 40 million square yards.If Lancashire concedes this, not only might the Indian industry withdraw their agreement, but negotiations with the Hong Kong industry might prove impossibly difficult.5.      A voluntary agreement between industries on the lines envisagedwould be of great benefit to the United Kingdom cotton industry, which isworried by the volume of imports from India and the rapid rise in imports from Pakistan and Hong Kong.     But, even if agreement betweenthe industries is reached, the arrangement will founder withoutsatisfactory methods of control.    Sir Cuthbert Clegg thinks that the outcome of his forthcoming negotiations with the Pakistan and Hong Kongindustries will be prejudiced unless he is authorised to state thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government agree in principle to the use of import licensing for controlling the arrangements.
6.      It can be argued, in support of giving him this authority, that thenegotiations were begun at the suggestion of the former Prime Minister;and the industry will press the Government to find means to make thearrangements work.    There is no doubt that Lancashire would beincensed if, by refusing to undertake import controls, the Governmentfrustrated a voluntary agreement between United Kingdom and Common-wealth industries.7.      As against this, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have a special responsibility towards Hong Kong.    To impose quota restrictions againsta member of the sterling area, particularly a dependent territory, wouldbe a new departure of  policy.    It would be the more difficult to changeour policy of not using quotas against the sterling area at a time when we are proposing the eventual removal of quotas and tariffs onmanufactured goods from Europe.     Moreover, such action might haveharmful and far-reaching effects:   it would be difficult to stop at textiles,since there are other imports, for example gloves from Hong Kong,which have caused embarrassment to our industry.8.      The general view of the Committee, the President of the Board ofTrade reserving his position while he discussed the matter further with sir Cuthbert Clegg, was that it would be premature to give assurances about any controls which Her Majesty*s Government would be prepared toundertake.    Sir Cuthberg Clegg should be encouraged to proceed withhis mission to Fakistan and Hong Kong, and should be invited, without commitment, to give his advice to Her Majesty&apos;s Government on themost effective methods of policing any agreements reached, at theconclusion of his negotiations.    The Committee recognised that, if only because of the special position of Hong Kong, these methods mightvary between the different countries concerned.    Judging from thesuccess of the mission to India, prior assurances about import licensingwould not appear to be an essential factor in the further negotiationswith Pakistan and Hong Kong.9.      The President of the Board of Trade will make an oral report tothe Cabinet on the upshot of his further discussions with sir Cuthbert Clegg.7th March, 1957.
