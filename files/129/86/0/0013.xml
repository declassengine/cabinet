i Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1957SECRET Copy No. 52C. (57)6311th March, 1957CABINETPENSIONS : GAS AND ELECTRICITY industries memorandum by the Minister of PowerWe are encountering opposition in Parliament to the decision taken by theSub-Committee of the Home Affairs Committee on supplementary pensions inthe nationalised industries not to increase pensions of gas and electricity industrypensioners who before nationalisation were employed by companies. Dame IreneWard has been particularly active in opposing this decision as far as gas companypensioners are concerned and has approached many Ministers, including the PrimeMinister, about it; it is, in fact, at the Prime Minister^ request that I am nowputting the matter to the Cabinet.2. This is a most difficult problem. The complaint arises out of the distinctionthat has been made between the ex-company pensioners and pensioners who beforenationalisation were employed by local authorities. The ex-municipal gas pensionersare entitled to benefit from any increase in pensions paid to other former municipalemployees. Thus the higher pensions provided under the Pensions (Increase) acts of 1952 and 1956, for local government employees, were extended to ex-municipalgas and electricity pensioners in September 1953 and April 1956 respectively.    . i3. The ex-gas company pensioners cannot establish any legal right to benefit from these Acts and we have taken the line that it had never been intended that increases awarded to ex-company pensioners should in any way be tied to the Acts.It is true that after much discussion some supplementation of pension somewhat similar to those of the Pensions (Increase) Act of 1952 was granted to ex-gascompany pensioners in April 1956. But the Home Affairs Committee recentlyturned down a request to award a further increase in pensions to gas companypeople in line with those granted to gas municipal people under the Act of 1956.4. Frankly I do not find this an easy decision to defend. We are givingdifferent treatment to men who have done identical jobs and probably now liveside by side in retirement. The difficulty is that if we grant &amp;i further increase togas ex-company pensioners we shall have to do the same for electricity whoapplied for an increase at the same time as the gas pensioners and possibly forthe railways; although there is no such traditional link between the railway industryand gas industry as there is between gas and electricity. I think the Minister ofTransport would agree that it is the railways in particular that present the most difficult problem. Ex-railway company pensioners received an increase last April,but it was much less generous than that given to ex-gas and electricity companypensioners, and I understand that in their present financial situation the british transport Commission would be most reluctant to contemplate a further concession.51333
5. On the other hand, I think that our position is weak in that, by grantingincreases to ex-company pensioners last,year,in line with.those already grantedto ex-municipal pensioners, we appeared to admit the1 moral right of the companypeople to be given similar treatment to the local authority people.6. I suggest therefore that we should ask the sub-Committee of the HomeAffairs Committee to look again at their decision with a view to granting somesupplementation of pension to ex-company pensioners of both the gas and electricity industries.Ministry of Power, S.W.I.8th March, 1957..
