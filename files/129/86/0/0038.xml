BERMUDA CONFERENCE, MARCH 1957Prime Ministers Notes for Opening Statement1. Grateful to PresidentReceive as host; greet as old comrade; welcome as head of the greatest andmost powerful nation in the world.2. Critical Time in HistoryIn short time, tremendous problems of Suez Canal and Middle East, on whichlife of Europe depends.Also critical in secular struggle against Communism; and future of united nations.League of Nations failed because it placed peace before justice and so lostboth.3. Some General ReflectionsBalance of power changed; so quickly difficult to grasp.When I was a child Queen Victoria&apos;s Concert of Powers i.e., european powers.Austrian, Hungarian and Turkish Empires have gone.Large part of Europe and Asia balkanised.Europe destroyed itself in two internecine struggles.The immense powers of the United States and USSR dominate whole world.Many countries in Europe are tempted to give up struggle.Neutralism (disguised sometimes as Third Force.   Concept).I must frankly admit recent events have revived this in Britain.But I believe you cannot be neutral in a war between two principals, one ofwhich Communism is evil.With change in balance of power, change in position of Western andChristian civilisation.For about 2,500 years Whites have had it their way.Now revolution; Asia/Africa.Bound to be immense stresses and great power vacuums over great areas.Who is to fill these voids?  Russia, China or free alliance.The number of uncommitted countries must increase, as they emerge from colonial or other dependence to independence.We in Britain cannot stop; but we might now and then control this process.In ten to fifteen years, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma.Now Ghana, in August Malaya; next Singapore.Same process going on in French territories: Tunisia, Morocco, soon Algeria.Indonesia.Within ten to fifteen years of mutually destructive European war, theseimmense territories have become in effect neutral.
In the Middle East countries more or less under guidance have become morerestless and obsessed by Moslem and nationalist propaganda.In this confusion, Europe is divided between those who wish to watch fromthe sidelines-for a change and those who are ready to play their full part.I believe Britain I know my Government will be for staying in the gameand pulling our weight.That is why I welcome full restoration of confidence and co-operation between our two countries.Partly sentiment, though sentiment may work both ways-there are people who still seem to be harking back to that Tea in Boston Harbour.Partly interest powerful as you are I don&apos;t believe you can do it alone.You need us: for ourselves; for Commonwealth; and as leaders of Europe.But chiefly because without a common front and true partnership between us i doubt whether the principles we believe in can win.We have a long agenda. Some of it will perhaps do best to get the foreign ministers to work on before bringing their conclusions to us.Some for instance Defence I hope we may have the advantage of yourunique experience, Mr. President.Perhaps it would be best to start with the pressing and immediate problems e.g., some of the Middle East questions.Before we do so I hope you will forgive me if I make in conclusion someobservations on an urgent issue with that frankness which true partnership andcomradeship not only allow but, in honour, require.We can discuss what we are to do in the longer term about many issues.What we are to do about the Far East; about a Palestine settlement; evenabout how to manage the United Nations.(Sometimes an ideal, sometimes an embarrassment.)But there is one issue in the immediate future on which our people feelpassionately, and on which my country&apos;s power to be of service to our commonefforts may well depend.That is Nasser and the Canal. .Let us be frank.I don&apos;t suppose that either of our Governments or peoples has any love forNasser.After all, he is just a self-elected dictator, who plays off the West and theEast but is more and more sold to the Communist.It&apos;s like Mussolini he started, in a way, as an Italian patriot.He ended as Hitler&apos;s stooge.Let me be frank again: your Government and many of your people think weacted foolishly and precipitately and illegally.Our Government and many of our people think that you were too hard onus and rather let us down.Well, that&apos;s over spilt milk.Don&apos;t lefs cry over it still less wallow in it.But the Canal remains.
/ hope you will do everything you possibly canby pressure on Nasser;by cajoling Hammarskjold;by bribery of Nasser if necessary (only I hope you might consult with us*     as to what particular form this might take, so as not to be too embarrassing to us);to get a Canal settlement, short and long especially regarding dues which we can claim as reasonable, if not quite what we would like!But if we can&apos;t get it if Nasser is absolutely obdurate, just blackmails us andother maritime countries, if we all have, in the short run, to eat dirt and accept abad and unjust settlement, I hope you won&apos;t say in public or in private that it&apos;s agood settlement.I hope you will denounce Nasser and all his works in the strongest terms.Bring every pressure political and economic upon him.If we have to accept a humiliating defeat don&apos;t let&apos;s call it a victory or evena draw.Lefs make it clear that we&apos;ll get him down sooner or later.Our people have been through some bad times in the first half of the centuryfor progress.They have learned, I think, patience: how to wait.But they can&apos;t be fooled.Funnily enough for they have about as great a sense of fairness as of self-interest the British people and Parliament feel as strongly about Gaza, Akabaand treatment of Israel, as about the Canal and Canal dues.It&apos;s rather embarrassing to us, the Government, because of the oil producing countries, and the risks involved, but it is so.Anyway, I do hope that if we have to accept a bad settlement in the shortterm, you will make it clear that it is a bad settlement, foisted upon us by ablackmailer and a crook.Any other course would I fear cause such a rift between our countries and people as would take much longer to repair than the urgent needs of the worldallow.
