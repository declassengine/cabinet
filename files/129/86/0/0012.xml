BRITISH SUBJECTS FROM egypt memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Lord Privy seal at our meeting on 29th January (C.C. (57) 4th Conclusions,Minute 2) I reported that the Home Affairs Committee had set up a specialSub-Committee to examine the problems of British subjects expelled from egypt, among them that of resettlement.     The Sub-Committee have made recommendations on this subject which have been accepted by the HomeAffairs Committee and which I now submit to my colleagues for final approval.2.      The various classes and rates of payment set out below have been recommended on the assumptions (a) that payments by the Anglo-egyptian resettlement Board will be related solely to present needs in this countryand will not in any sense be compensation for lost assets in Egypt - a quite separate consideration;  and (b) that the Board should be expected to relate payments to individual needs, so that the figures given below foreach class of payment should be regarded as maxima - with the exceptionof the personal allowance in paragraph 3, which should normally be at a fixed rate.     It is not proposed that the Board should give any publicity to the rates of payment which may be authorised.Personal Allowance3,      This should be available to cover clothing and personal effects, atthe following rate:-For each person over 18 years of age         50For each person under 18 years of age       25up to a maximum of  200 for any one family ofadults (or married couple) and dependent children.This allowance should, exceptionally, be paid at a fixed ratebecause of the practical difficulty and undesirability of investigating anindividuals personal needs.Accommodation Allowance4.      Three types of payment are recommended as a means of assistingrefugees to find accommodation and leave hostels:-COPY NO. *3(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER britannic MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)tSECRETC.(57) 629th March, 1957CABINET
(i)   The payment of grants to assist refugees in makingdeposits for the purchase of housesThe Board should be authorised to make a grantof up to  400 to cover a deposit to a building society and legal fees in suitable cases, where they aresatisfied that the applicant could subsequentlymaintain mortgage payments.(ii)   The provision of a financial inducement to localauthorities to make Council houses available forrefugeesThe Board should be authorised to make a grantof  300 (the capital equivalent of a slum clearancesubsidy) to a local authority for any house providedfor a family expelled from Egypt, on the condition thatthe Board should have the right to nominate the tenantand to re-nominate other tenants for a period of fiveyears.(iii)   The provision of a financial inducement to housing associations to find rented accommodation for refugeesThe Board should be authorised to make a grant of up to  300 to serve as the deposit for an individualrefugee with a housing association for rented accommodation made available to a family expelledfrom Egypt.Method (ii) involves some risk of political criticism, as it entails making an appeal to local authorities which may not be well received by some, andmight also lead to complaints of preferential treatment for British subjects from Egypt over other candidates for housing.     It may be desirable thatthe Board should make grants to local authorities only in cases where theprovision of housing for British subjects from Egypt will not entail any reduction in the local authority&apos;s general housing programme.Furnishing allowance5. The Board should be authorised to make payments for the furnishingof accommodation as follows:-(i)  For accommodation in a whole house or half a house 180 for first two adults (e.g. man and wife,or widow and her mother) or for a singleadult with one child;plus  50 for each additional adult and  20 foreach additional child;up to a maximum of  350 for each family.(ii)  For accommodation in one or two rooms only:-a maximum of  180.    *
12(iii)  For furnished accommodation:- 30 for a single person; 50 for a family.Allowance for professional equipment and tools6.     The Board should be authorised to make payments in appropriate cases, up to a maximum of  100, for the provision of such equipment asa professional man or craftsman may need to enable him to take up hisaccustomed occupation in this country.Allowance for establishment of small businesses7.     The Board should have discretion, in cases where this appears tooffer the best chance of resettling a refugee, to make, in addition to thepayments recommended above, a grant of up to  400 to assist in thepurchase of a small business.    Where exceptionally the Board feel thatthere is a case for a larger grant, the approval of the Secretary of state should be sought.Estimated cost.     On the assumption that there will be a total of some 5,000 Britishsubjects from Egypt needing assistance for resettlement, it is estimatedthat assistance on the scales set out above would entail expenditure of theorder of  1 million.9.     I think it important that we should not be ungenerous in thismatter; the balance of advantage, on economic as well as other grounds,clearly rests in providing sufficient help at the outset to enable theseBritish subjects to establish themselves as self-supporting members ofour community without delay, and in preventing them from becoming a continuing burden on public funds.    The rates recommended above are by no means lavish;  no average family group is likely to benefit by morethan some  750- 1,000, which will not provide more than an austere basis for beginning life in this country for people who, in most cases, have noother assets at all.    Further, I think we must be prepared to exercise the discretion implied in the last sentence of paragraph 7 with sufficientflexibility to meet the needs of those who may, in a few cases, need a considerably larger sum of money to establish themselves in a way of life comparable to that to which they have been accustomed.R.A.B.Home Office, S. W.l.8th March, 1957.-3
