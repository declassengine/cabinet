secret.(57) 91 COPY NO5th April, 1957CABINETFUTURE OF NATIONAL service memorandum by the Minister of Labourand National service have been considering with the Minister of Defence and theService Ministers ways in which National Service can be adapted in future to meet the reduced manpower needs of the Armed Forces.   The number ofmen becoming available for National Service has already for some time past been greater than the Forces&apos; requirements and this has been met by reducing the number of registrations and allowing the age of call-upto rise.   The greatly reduced requirements now envisaged, however, poseproblems of quite a different order.2. It is now envisaged that the total adult male all-rank strengthof the Forces should be reduced from the present figure of 690,000 toabout 375,000 by the end of 1962 and that National Servicemen should notbe called up after the end of 1960.   On present estimates the Forces would need the following numbers each year from the men becoming availablefor National Service.Thousands1957/58 1201958/59 761959/60 621960  (April to December) 21These figures compare with a requirement of 162,000 for 1956/57 as setout in the Statement on Defence, 1956.3. To meet these total requirements of 279*000 men, it isestimated that there will be some 570,000 fit men within the scope of theNational Service Acts (i.e. men born in 1940 and earlier) who will beavailable for call-up between 31st March, 1957 and 31st December, 1960.Some 330,000 of these are men who have not yet been required to register (i.e. they were born between 1st October, 1938 and31st December, 1940).   The remainder will be men who are at present on deferment or in process of call-up.4. Arrangements are already in hand to register in May this yearmen born in the fourth quarter of 1938.   On a purely arithmetical basis the product of this registration together with men who have alreadyregistered and are in process of call-up or become available on terminationof deferment between now and the end of 1960 would be sufficient to meetService requirements.   In fact, however, the margin for contingencies
would probably be too small and in any event unless steps were takento prevent it a situation would arise in which the Forces were being supplied increasingly and preponderantly with older men, most of whom had completed apprenticeships or courses for university degrees orprofessional qualifications,5. There is therefore a problem both as to numbers and quality.We must aim to reduce the surplus of available men over requirements and to prevent the widespread employment of skilled men and those withdegrees or professional qualifications on routine duties.   The gap between 570,000 men available and 279,000 men required is too greatto be bridged by any system of extending deferment to selected industries,or to new categories of young men.   If we cannot devise a scheme thatachieves this reduction while retaining the principle of universal liabilityon which National Service is be.aed we would have to use the ballot.   Ibelieve that the ballot is politically unacceptable and I suggest in thefollowing paragraphs a method by which we can achieve the reductionwithout destroying the fundamental principle of National Service.6. The undue preponderance of older skilled men can only be avoided by registering and calling up sufficient numbers of younger men.It has, however, always been the practice that broadly speaking men whobecome available for posting to the Forces are called up oldest first.It would not therefore be enough merely to register further classes of young men.   Steps must be taken to ensure that a due proportion of men called up consists of these younger men.   We propose that this shouldbe done by drawing a distinction between (a) men who become availablefor call-up because their deferment, as e.g. apprentices or students,has expired;  (b) younger men becoming available for call-up afterregistration in the normal way.   In effect, the register of men availablefor posting to the Forces would be separated into two sections, the firstconsisting generally of men aged 21 or over and the second of men below that age.   Within each section call-up would continue very much as atpresent.   This has been designed to meet as far as possible the detailedrequirements of the Forces, the wishes of individuals for early call-up on a particular allocation, and in general to avoid undue delay.   Subjectto this, men would continue to be called up oldest first.   The proportions,however, which the number of men posted from one section should bearover a period to those posted from the other would be pre-determined in order to secure a more balanced intake into the Forces.   The preciseproportions could be changed if this should subsequently prove necessary.The Annex shows how this scheme would work on the basis of a proportionof two older men to one younger man for 1958/59 and succeeding years.In 1957/58 call-up would proceed as at present.7. The great advantage of this scheme is that it maintains theprinciple of universal service in the sense that all fit young men bornbefore a particular date would be required to do National Service.   (It istrue that men who have not been called up by the end of 1960 becausethey were on deferment or for any other reason would in fact escape,but this would happen under any scheme).   Other advantages of the scheme are that it does not require legislation, that it avoids a ballot and thatit would enable an announcement to be made when considered appropriate that men within the scope of the National Service Acts who were bornafter a certain date (e.g. men born in 1940 or after the middle of 1939)would not be called upon to do National Service.   The disadvantages are that it would be clear that some older men were being relieved of NationalService at the expense of younger men, and that as will be seen from the annex there would be a high age of call-up for the younger men in the later stages.   There would also inevitably be some delay and uncertaintyparticularly towards the end.
8. It is an underlying assumption of the scheme that existingdeferment policy will remain substantially unchanged.9. The question arises as to what would happen if when the time comes it were not found possible to end the call-up at the end of 1960.It is my view that in that event it would be necessary to have fresh legislation to produce the required addition to the Forces in thecircumstances then obtaining, whether this or any other schemedesigned to meet the problems of the interim period had been adopted.Otherwise the age of call-up of men still liable for National service under the existing Acts would rise above 21.10. Any scheme for meeting the surplus of available manpower overthe forces requirements is bound to have disadvantages, but aftercarefully considering the various possibilities I have come to the clearconclusion that the method proposed in this paper is the best.   I there-fore invite my colleagues to endorse it.   If the scheme is approved theappropriate occasion for making an announcement about it would be inthe Defence debate.11. This paper does not cover doctors and dentists who will needseparate consideration.12. The Minister of Defence agrees with the views expressed intlais memorandum.I.M.Ministry of Labour and national Service, S.W.I.5th April, 1957-3
For the purpose of the calculations which follow it is assumed that (a) no special measures arc taken in 1957/58 and that there is oneregistration of young men (i0e. the last quarter of the 1938 class whichis already planned for May 1957);    (b) that the scheme begins on1st April, 1958 and the proportion is two older men to one younger mana1258^2Forces1 re quirements:/Tounger menOlder menAvailabiliti es;1.

This means that requirements over3if years would be met so far as younger men are concerned by a nine months supply (apart from any at present in process of being called up).The age of call-up rises unless a twelve months supply of younger men is called up over twelve months and under the scheme it would thereforerise quite rapidly.     It is difficult to be precise but it is likely thatthe age of call-up of younger men would reach 20 by about the end of1958 and 21 by early in 1960*
