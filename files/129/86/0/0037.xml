SECRETrC.(57) 87 COPY NO.  ^ t**-1st April, 1957CABINETSUDAN CURRENCYMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsThe ProblemWe have undertaken to release to the Sudan Government from theEgyptian sterling balances in connexion with the redemption of theEgyptian currency now circulating in the Sudan any sum upon which theGovernments of the Sudan and Egypt may agree and which is reasonable in the opinion of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.   The Egyptian Governmenthave agreed to the redemption in this way of all the Egyptian currency.The Sudan Government have accordingly asked us for  20 millions.We have offered  10 millions forthwith and the possibility of a furtherrelease after a general settlement with Egypt.   The Sudan Minister ofFinance regards this as inadequate and indefensible.   He claims as of right a release much nearer the figure of  20 millions.Recommendation2.       We should increase our offer to  15 millions, to be releasedforthwith.   Alternatively, provided that this sum is separated from theEgyptian sterling balances now we should agree to release  10 millionsnow and the remaining  5 millions in a year&apos;s time.   If this course is approved, but not otherwise, a small Sudanese Delegation should beallowed to invite themselves to London for the ostensible purpose of persuading us in this sense.Argument3.       The Sudanese Government are about to introduce their owncurrency to take the place of the Egyptian currency now in circulation.In negotiating with the Egyptians for the redemption of the Egyptiancurrency the Sudanese have taken the opportunity to press their claim fora share of the Foreign Exchange Reserves accumulated by Egypt duringthe period when Egypt and the Sudan were a single economic and monetary unit.4.       Last year before the Suez crisis we undertook to make a specialrelease from the Egyptian sterling balances which were at that timeblocked under a Releases Agreement.   No figure was mentioned but our understanding was that the Egyptians were unlikely to offer more than 7 millions or  8 millions.   Our undertaking was repeated in general terms after Egypfs seizure of the Suez Canal.   Early this year we agreedto the transfer to a separate Sudanese account of &quot;a sum which is both
reasonable and agreed to by the Governments of Egypt and the Sudan&quot;,The Sudan Government thereupon obtained from the Egyptian government statement in writing that the latter were prepared to redeem allEgyptian currency circulating in the Sudan out of their sterling balances.The Sudan Government accordingly asked us for  20 millions whichthey stated, to be the estimated value of the currency in question.We then offered an immediate release of  10 millions and the possibilityof a further release after we had reached a settlement for the generalunblocking of Egypt&apos;s sterling balances.5.      The Sudanese Minister of Finance has rejected our offer.   In aletter to H.M. Ambassador, Sir E. Chapman Andrews, of which I annex the text as transmitted in Khartoum telegram No. 335 of 25th Marchhe declares that he cannot defend such an offer publicly.   He contrastsour &quot;restrictive&quot; attitude with the generous attitude of Egypt and he particularly resents the implication that the Sudan&apos;s share of theEgyptian balances depends in some way on settlement of our privatescores with Egypt,6.       We can admit that there is some element of bargaining in theSudan Government^ stand over the amount of the sterling release.   Forone thing, the Minister of Finance only asks for &quot;a figure approaching 20 millions&quot;.   For another, the Sudan Government ought to be able tobring Egypt to redeem the currency not only by releases of sterlingbut by other means as well.   But Sir John Carmiehael, the BritishFinancial Adviser to the Sudan Government, and also Mr. Loombe ofthe Bank of England have urged us strongly that to offer less than 15 millions will entail serious risks.   And we have good reason tobelieve that Egypt will not contribute anything but sterling for thepurposes of redeeming the currency, so that by restricting the releaseof sterling we should be hurting the Sudan without hurting Egypt.7.       The Sudan occupies a vital strategic position.   It is one of thegates to Africa, lying as it does athwart the River Nile and borderingon British and other Colonial territories.   It should be our object toencourage the Sudan in an independent stand against Colonel Nasser,to consolidate her relations with the United Kingdom and, particularyat this juncture, to strengthen the hand of Abdullah Khalil whose conductin Sudanese policy has been very much to our advantage.   For example,the convenient and economical facilities which we enjoy at Khartoumairport for trooping and military flights have hitherto been defended bythe Sudanese Prime Minister personally in the face of considerablepublic criticism.   Contrariwise, if we cannot make a satisfactory arrange-ment with the Sudan Government now we may weaken the position of thepresent Sudanese Government with resultant prejudice to our interests.Among the latter I would also mention United Kingdom trade in whatappears to be a very promising market.   I regard the establishment ofa sound Sudanese currency closely linked with sterling as conducive to these respects.8.       I can well understand the objections to any arrangement which seemed likely to result in substantial drawings of sterling at this juncture.However, it is virtually certain that whatever sterling is made availableto the Sudan now will be used as backing for the new Sudanese currency and will not be spent.   I also appreciate the objections to reducingsubstantially the amount of the Egyptian blocked balances in view of our need for bargaining power when it comes to negotiating a settlement with Egypt.   Clearly we want to be in a position to do the best we can
both for Her Majesty&apos;s Government and for individual British claimants.It was therefore understandable that while offering  10 millions now we should have promised to consider a further release after a general settlement with Egypt.9.       But quite apart from the resentment which this feature of our offer has caused to the Sudan Government, it appears likely to lead us into serious trouble in the future.   For if we only agree to release theadditional  5 millions (or even any lesser amount) as part of thegeneral settlement with Egypt,we shall almost certainly be faced with one of two alternative situations.   Either it will be a friendly settlement,in which case we shall want to give Egypt everything we can or, more likely, it will be a bad bargain, as part of which we shall have to compensate British claimants against Egypt out of the sterling balances,and here again we shall be reluctant to make any further release to theSudan.   Not only this, but wjhereas today Egypt chooses to be generouson the grounds that she will never see a penny of the sterling balances,she can and probably will revert to her old policy of meanness towardsthe Sudan as soon as these balances become once more a subject fordiscussion with us.   She can then not only squeeze the Sudan but also make trouble for us in so doing.   In fact from now onwards we shallhave the problem of the additional release to the Sudan hanging overour heads, we shall lose the propaganda initiative to the Egyptians andour relations with the Sudan will deteriorate.10.     Balancing the advantages and disadvantages, I conclude therefore that our best course is to agree now to a figure of  15 millions, to beregarded, of course, as disposing for good and all of the question ofthe Sudanese share of the Egyptian sterling balances.   There is every-thing to be said for releasing the whole amount at once but if theChancellor preferred we could adopt Sir E. Chapman-Andrews&apos;suggestion of a release of  10 millions now coupled with a definiteundertaking to release the remainder in one year&apos;s time.   If this could be agreed, it would be an additional advantage if a SudaneseDelegation came to London as suggested by the Permanent Under-Secretary of the Sudanese Ministry of Finance.   It would be very unwise to bring a Delegation here unless we had decided in advance to increase our offer substantially; but if such a decision had in fact been taken thewhole operation could be represented as an outstanding success for the sudanese Government, and Her Majesty&apos;s Government would certainlycome out extremely well.* S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.1.1st April, 1957
Letter dated 24th March from the SudanMinister of Finance to Sir E. Chapman AndrewsDear Sir Edwin,You told me this morning of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentsagreement to release to the Sudan  10 million sterling from Egypt&apos;sblocked balances, I told you of my disappointment that the figure was so small, and I am writing to you now in the hope that late efforts may bemade to increase the figure.There is, of course, bound to be adverse criticism of this offer of  10 million sterling if and when it becomes public, and I myselfshould find it impossible to defend on the grounds of equity.In my letter to you of December 21 last 1 enclosed a memorandummaking a case that the Sudan had been a net seller of some  E20 million in foreign exchange to Egypt.   Your Government has made no referenceto this case, although it had agreed in principle in 1947 that the Sudanhad contributed to sterling balances held by Egypt and was willing thatthese balances should be run down by some  1^-to  2 million sterlingif the need arose.   The Sudan&apos;s position in this respect was safeguardedin general terms in a clause in subsequent financial agreements between her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Sudan.The fact that the Sudan, because of prudent exercise of herfinancial affairs, had no need to make substantial use of this clauseshould never have been allowed to affect its rights.   Nevertheless, in1955, and despite representations to Her Majesty&apos;s Government to theeffect that the Sudan wished to continue to have safeguarded its interestsin sterling balances held by Egypt, the clause was omitted from the new financial agreement between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and Egypt withoutfurther consultation with the Sudan.This act by the condominium Powers was surely a most inequitableone, and the Sudan must hold Her Majesty&apos;s Government responsible for thisfailure to safeguard her interests in this respect.Now, particularly when Egypt has given her consent to releases from her sterling balances to the Sudan for redemption of Egyptiancurrency, it is all the more disappointing that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould be restrictive in her agreement to a release to the Sudan.I told you that we feel we have a right to  20 million sterling asset out in earlier memorandum.   I am convinced that the figure cannotbe far short of  20 million, if in fact, it is not more.   The figure of 10 million, which Her Majesty&apos;s Government has now offered, fallsfar short of any figure which I could agree to, and would be willing tosupport publicly, as a fair settlement.I must emphasize that I cannot overlook the fact that her majesty&apos;s Government failed to safeguard the Sudan&apos;s interests in generalrights of sterling releases from balances in Egypt&apos;s name.  And I certainly cannot accept that the situation which has recently arisen between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and Egypt, and in which Sudan had no part, can be used in any way as an excuse to reduce the Sudanis rights toreceive a release of sterling much nearer the figure of  2 0 million.
I therefore hope that you will again approach your Governmentand seek agreement to a release of a figure approaching  20 million.Meanwhile, I shall endeavour to see that news of the offer youconveyed to me does not become public.Yours sincerely,(Signed)  IBRAHIM AHMED,Minister of Finance and Economics
