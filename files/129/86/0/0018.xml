134(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY. OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 6813th March, 1957PUBLIC SERVICE salaries memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerWhen the Cabinet considered my paper on public service salaries(C.(57) 42) no decision was reached on increases for the lower judiciary,the university professors and the Comptroller and Auditor General(C.C. (57) 14th Conclusions, Minute 6).    The need for raising the salaries of university professors was urgent and with the agreement ofthe Prime Minister I announced an increase yesterday to take effect from 1st August.2,     The changes proposed for the lower judiciary are almost whollyconsequential on the changes made in 1954 for the senior judges and Ido not think that it would be either justifiable or wise to hold them up any longer.    And the proposed increase for the Comptroller and auditor General is consequential on the changes made in the CivilService a year ago.3.     I do not think that to announce these increases now would have any effect on the wages position generally, nor on the doctors, and Ipropose that we should announce forthwith our intention to introduceBills dealing with the salaries of the lower judiciary and the comptroller and Auditor General.P.T.COPY NO.s6CABINETTreasury Chambers, S.
