Printed&apos;for the Cabinet&apos;.   April 1957.SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 893rd April, 1957CABINETREMUNERATION OF DOCTORS AND DENTISTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Minister of health the Prime Minister announced in the House on 12th March that theGovernment were considering what should be done by way of an interim adjustment of the remuneration of doctors and dentists covered by the Royal Commission-other than junior hospital staff, who have already been awarded a 10 per cent,increase as from 1st April and promised to make a further statement in due course.The appointment of the members of the Royal Commission was announced on thesame date and it has already started work. The principle of the further adjustmentwas accepted by the Cabinet on 12th March (C.C. (57) 17th Conclusions, 1),and it is now necessary to decide:  (1) the timing of the announcement;(2) the timing of the adjustment itself;(3) the amount of the adjustment; and(4) the methods of applying it.2. The Cabinet on 7th March thought that the announcement should be made before Easter. This intention is reinforced by the fact that the present proposalsof the representatives of general medical practitioners for large-scale withdrawalsfrom the National Health Service are to come for decision on 30th April before a conference representative of local medical committees throughout the country.This will be followed on 1st May by a representative meeting of the British medical association and it will be much more difficult to bring about a change of courseafter that date.3. The most convenient and appropriate date to award the adjustment fromwould be 1st July the beginning of the next quarterly period for which general practitioners will be paid. Any increases must be awarded as from some future date, because (in the case of hospital staffs and general dental practitioners) itwill have to be effected by regulations which cannot legally be retrospective.4. On the amount of any interim adjustment, the figure which, with theChancellor of the Exchequer, we provisionally put before the Cabinet was per cent., although one or two of our colleagues thought that 7 or 8 per cent,would be more reasonable. The adjustment must, of course, be less than the10 per cent, already given to the junior hospital doctors and dentists, whose claim was generally agreed to be the more deserving. In the light of recent developments,particularly in industry, we feel that 1\ per cent, (compared with a claim of24 per cent.) would appear to public opinion as a just and fair figure and would be acceptable to the vast number of moderately-minded people in the profession.Having made such an interim adjustment, we should then stand absolutely firmuntil the Royal Commission has reported. The cost in a full year of a 1\ per cent.51439
increase (for England, and Wales and Scotland and including the value of exchequer superannuation contributions) would be approximately:  5. On methods of application, there is no difficulty in the case of hospitalstaffs and general dental practitioners: the former could be given a straightforwardpercentage increase on their basic salaries and the latter on the fees they receivefor items of service and their remuneration for part-time work in hospitals.6. For the general practitioners we have up to now thought in terms of a flat rate addition to the capitation fee. The profession is however known to attach greatimportance to discussion with them of the distribution of any award within theamount determined by the Government. We think that discussion with the profession might help to meet the criticism that the Government have treated themarbitrarily and that there are advantages in their sharing responsibility for distribution between different groups of doctors. Subject to the views of our colleagues we propose that the announcement should be limited to the amountof the award&apos;to general practitioners leaving its distribution to be settled with the profession.7. To sum up, we propose to our colleagues that, subject to the economic andindustrial situation, the Government should announce, very shortly before the easter recess, an interim increase of 1\ per cent, for senior hospital medical and dental staff and general medical and dental practitioners to operate as from 1st July next.   We should then await the conclusions of the Royal Commission.  MillionSenior hospital staffsGeneral medical practitionersGeneral dental practitioners1-83-71-87-3J. S. M.D. F. V.2nd April, 1957.
