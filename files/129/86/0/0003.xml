Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 534th March, 1957CABINET- germany memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 21st January, 1957 (C.C. (57) 2nd Conclusions), the Cabinet authorisedme to arrange for the resumption of discussions with the United States, Franceand Germany about German reunification. Agreement has now been reached that a Working Group, composed of official representatives of these three countries and of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, should meet in Washington on March 6. its terms of reference will be to review the inter-related problems of Germanreunification and European security on the basis of the proposals made at theForeign Ministers&apos; meeting in Geneva. In making its review the Working group will take account of developments and Soviet proposals since the Foreign Ministers&apos;Conference.Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs policy . Our aim is a reunified Germany belonging to the North Atlantic treaty organisation (N.A.T.O.). As things are at the present moment, we believe thatthis would be achieved if the Western proposals for the reunification of germany were adopted. These proposals are for free all-German elections resulting in anall-German Government free to choose its own internal and external policies. Thesecurity guarantees offered by the Western Powers at Geneva were designed to reassure the Soviet Government against the contingency of a reunified germany in N.A.T.O. But we do not consider that new security arrangements without the(reunification of Germany would be of any lasting value, since they would noteliminate the main cause of insecurity in Europe, which is the division of Germany.Soviet policy. The Soviet aim is to break up N.A.T.O. and to secure the removal ofUnited States forces from bases in Europe. Eventually the Soviet Governmentmay hope also to incorporate a reunified Germany in the Soviet bloc. they proposed at Geneva a security system which included separate membership ofthe two parts of Germany and which envisaged the disbandment of N.A.T.O.and of the Warsaw Pact. They also insisted that the &quot; social achievements&quot;(i.e., Communism) of East Germany must be maintained; and they refused toagree to free all-German elections. Instead they said that reunification couldonly come about by negotiations between the two parts of Germany.Recent Developments4. Events in Poland and Hungary may have shown the weakness of Sovietpolitical control in the Satellites. But there has been no decline in Soviet military strength. Moreover Soviet action in Poland and, especially, in Hungary has confirmed that the Soviet Government are prepared to go to almost any lengthsto retain their influence in the Satellites. If they weakened in any one, their position in the others would be impaired. East Germany is of particular importance to them. It is not only the &quot; frontier &quot; State, where they keep a large army of 22 divisions, but also the base from which they hope that Communismwill one day be extended throughout the whole of Germany. It is also animportant source of uranium ore.51285
5. The Soviet Government have nevertheless proposed, e.g., in their statementof November 17, 1956, a &quot; thinning out &quot; and withdrawal of troops on both sidesin Europe, and the abolition of &quot; foreign bases.&quot; If indeed the Soviet Governmentcould get the West to accept these proposals they would have achieved the aim off their policy in Europe. With the disruption of N.A.T.O. and United states forces withdrawn to the United States, they might feel that, even in presentcircumstances, the threat of strong Soviet forces only a few hundred miles awayon Soviet territory would be sufficient to maintain their influence in the Satellites.A Neutral Germany6. This is sometimes suggested as a solution to the present deadlock. Thereare substantial arguments against it. The fundamental objection is that it isdoubtful whether a Power of the size and geographical situation of Germany canremain neutral. At worst, it would gravitate into the Communist bloc. At best,it would be an element of doubt and instability in the middle of Europe, playingoff one side against the other, e.g., as between the wars. Apart from this, ifneutrality was imposed on Germany, i.e., &quot; neutralisation,&quot; there is the problemof determining and controlling the scale and character of the armed forces whicha unified and neutral Germany would be allowed to possess. We could hardlyexpect Germany to consent willingly to the reimposition of discriminatoryinternational control. In any case, until reunification has taken place and anall-German Government been formed, there is no authority in Germany which iscompetent to decide such a matter. In practice, limitation and control wouldprobably only be brought into effect as part of a general system which is not atpresent in sight. There are also serious military objections. A neutral germany would mean the loss of the whole N.A.T.O. forward position and would possiblyresult in the withdrawal of United States forces from the Continent, withincalculable effects on N.A.T.O.7. In present circumstances, therefore, a reunified and neutral germany would be a major misfortune for the West. Unless we can achieve our aim of areunified Germany in N.A.T.O., we are better off with the present division, withthe Federal Republic in N.A.T.O., even though the continuation of this divisionmeans continued insecurity in Europe.United States and French Views8. Neither the United States nor the French Government are expected to propose any change in the basis of Western policy.:The Federal Governments Views9. Dr. von Brentano has recent declared that the Federal Government adhere to the Western proposals at Geneva and do not intend to pursue an &quot; independent &quot;foreign policy. Dr. Adenauer has come out strongly against the neutralisation ofGermany. On the other hand, Dr. Adenauer has been much criticised by theGerman Socialist Party (S.P.D.) opposition for prejudicing the chances forreunification by his rigid insistence on the policy of German membership ofN.A.T.O. The S.P.D. have put forward proposals for a European Security pactwhich would include a neutral reunified Germany. The Russians will no doubtdo their best to exploit, neutralist tendencies in the S.P.D. and elsewhere in theFederal Republic. Although therefore the Federal Government are unlikely to propose any change in the broad lines of Western policy, they may wish to secure agreement to some new initiative before the Federal elections in the autumn.Tasks of the Working Group10. (a) The first task of the Working Group will be to agree on an assessment of present Soviet aims with regard to Germany. The conclusion islikely to be that the Russians are not prepared to agree to reunification on any basis which the West could at present accept.(b) The Working Group should then examine any proposals which theFederal Government or the other members may make for a new initiative. Inpresent circumstances the purpose of such an initiative would be to supportDr. Adenauer&apos;s electoral campaign and enable us to satisfy opinion in the Westthat we are doing our best to secure a settlement and that the responsibility forfailure lies with the Russians.
(c) The Working Group may also examine other proposals, e.g., neutralisation,and, if possible, concert an agreed line on them.11. There are various amplifications of the Western proposals at Genevawhich could be made without altering their basis and aim. On European security,variations could be made in the phasing of the security guarantees in relation tothe process of reunification which might make our proposals more attractive tothe Russians. For example, we could offer the Russians a guarantee against german aggression which would come into force once elections had been held for an all-German Government and which would remain in force until Germanyjoined the European Security Treaty. There is also the proposal for a demilitarised zone in East Germany which we favoured in 1955 but which was never put tothe Russians owing to United States and French opposition.12. We should try to ascertain the views of our Allies on these and connectedpoints. In particular, we should try to find out what the Germans are thinkingand impress upon them the importance of the closest inter-Allied co-ordination.A Four-Power Conference with the Soviet Union13. From the propaganda point of view, there might be some advantage in proposing that a four-Power conference at the ministerial level be held in thelate summer, to discuss the German question. This might provide an opportunityfor showing up the Russians and making it abundantly clear to German opinionthat it is the obstructiveness of the Soviet Union which prevents any progress being made in the matter of reunification. On the other hand, such a four-power meeting might give the Russians a chance to advance a series of specious proposalscalculated to appeal to the German opposition and might, therefore, embarrass the German Government. It would be a mistake to press for the holding of sucha meeting against the wishes of Dr. Adenauer, who so far has shown himselfopposed to the idea. No doubt it would become clear during the meeting of theWorking Group whether Dr. Adenauer maintains this view. If so, we should not press for the holding of a conference. The Working Group will also have toconsider what our line should be if the Russians should propose a conference.Unless the German Government should be in favour of holding such a conference,our line should probably be that we would only agree to a conference if previouscontacts through diplomatic channels had established that there was some prospectof positive progress.Diplomatic Notes to the Soviet Government14. The Federal Government had an exchange of Notes with the SovietGovernment last year on the subject of reunification. No progress was made andthe Germans are taking up the correspondence again. They may ask us to sendNotes in support of any further Note they send, as they did last year. In general there would be no objection to this.Recommendations15. (a) Our aim should remain a reunified Germany in N.A.T.O.(b) No change should be made in the basis of our proposals on german reunification and European security.(c) We can agree to put forward amplifications of the Geneva proposalswhich, while not altering their substance, will help to satisfy public and parliamentary opinion in the West that we are doing our best to secure a settlement and that the responsibility for failure lies with the Russians.id) Unless Dr. Adenauer wants one, we should not propose a conference with the Russians on Germany at the present time and, if theRussians propose one, we should only agree if previous contactsthrough diplomatic channels had established that there was some prospect of progress.S.
