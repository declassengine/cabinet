CYPRUS AND THE NORTH atlantic treaty organisation memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign affairs on 4th March my colleagues invited me, in consultation with theColonial Secretary, to circulate for their consideration a draft of theterms of the British reply to the proposal of Lord Ismay, the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) that heshould initiate measures for conciliation in the Cyprus dispute(C.C.(57) 15th Conclusions, Minute 6).2.    After consulting the Colonial Secretary I have prepared two drafts,which are annexed.   The first (Draft A) presupposes that instead ofawaiting Lord Ismay&apos;s promised letter we should, by prior arrangement with him, ourselves take the initiative in suggesting action by theSecretary-General under the N.A.T.O. Resolution on the peaceful settlement of Disputes.3.     For purposes of presentation there would clearly be advantage in appearing to take the initiative in this manner.   On the other hand theSecretary-General, whose intention to approach the three Governmentsconcerned is evidently known to member Governments of N.A.T.O.,might find it difficult at this stage to be placed in the position of receiving a proposal from us.   Moreover he has already approached theGreek Permanent Representative, and has presumably approached the turk also.4.     The second draft (Draft B) is cast in the form of a reply to the invitation which Lord Ismay intends to address to us.5.     Each draft contains three basic stipulations which, in the colonial secretary&apos;s view and mine, are fundamental to any agreement on our part to accept the application of good offices procedure to Cyprus.6.     There are other questions which would need to be raised with theSecretary-General at an early stage, though preferably not in writing.These questions include the personalities to be chosen by the Secretary-General as his Assistants or his &quot;Committee&quot;; and the question of theprocedure to be followed.COPY NO.(ofCONFIDENTIALC.(57) 586th March, 1957CABINET
7.    On the latter point, the Colonial Secretary and I consider that thebest course would be to urge that conciliation should initially take theform of an attempt to secure agreement between the three governments on the basis of Lord Radcliffe&apos;s recommendations and the colonial secretary&apos;s statement of 19th December, 1956.   As part of the agreement it would be necessary for us to have an understanding on the applicationof self-determination to the Greek and Turkish communities.    If the attempt to reach a settlement on this basis should fail, we should need to be ready with an alternative proposal.   In my view this might bepartition.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.1.6th March, 1957DRAFT AMy dear Secretary-General,Her Majesty&apos;s Government have considered, in the light of the/satisfactory/ outcome of the United Nations debate on Cyprus and of thesignificant improvement in the security situation in the island, what further steps can most usefully be taken towards a settlement of existingdifferences between the countries concerned, all of whom are members ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.2.    /Members of the Organisation have on several occasions expressed their concern at the continuation of the Cyprus dispute, and you yourselfhave spoken on the matter to me./ I am now authorised to inform you that if, in view of the changed situation, you were disposed to offer yourgood offices under the Council&apos;s Resolution of 14th December, 1956,regarding the peaceful &quot;settlement of disputes, the United KingdomGovernment would be glad to accept them on the following basis -(i)    It would be understood that you and any persons whom youmight choose to assist you under the terms of the Resolution,would be concerned with &quot;procedures of enquiry, mediation and conciliation&quot;.
