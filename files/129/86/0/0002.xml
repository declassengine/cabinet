Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1957SECRET Copy No,  5gC. (57) 521st March, 1957CABINETCREDIT TRADING bill note by the Lord ChancellorIt is necessary to submit for the Cabinefs decision the question whether weshould proceed with the proposed Credit Trading Bill in this session.2. The Credit Trading Bill (copy attached) forms part of the legislative programme for the session, and the Government^ intention to legislate on thissubject was announced in The Queen&apos;s Speech. The first part of the Bill is designed to provide the Government with permanent powers to control hire-purchase trading as such, and makes a significant contribution towards reducingthe area in which the Government is still obliged to rely on the defence regulations. The second part of the Bill is aimed at bringing under control theactivities of numerous and in some cases doubtfully sound finance houses whichhave grown up in support of hire-purchase trading. The operations of these companies are thought to constitute an important loophole in the system of creditcontrol, while the collapse of any number of these establishments in a period oftrade recession (or even a few of them leading to a more general loss of confidence)might cause serious loss to many individual members of the public who haveinvested money in them at very high rates of interest. The Bill therefore providesthat these finance companies should henceforward be required to maintainsatisfactory approved ratios between capital resources and liabilities to depositorson the one hand, and between liquid assets and borrowings on the other hand.It is not proposed to prescribe ratios of this kind for regular banking institutions.3. The drafting of this Bill has presented unusual difficulty as a technicaloperation; in the meantime, some difference of opinion has arisen between theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade on the needfor, or indeed the desirability of, the second part of the Bill which is concernedwith liquidity ratios. It was left that a decision on whether to proceed with theBill should be deferred until it could be taken on the basis of a draft Bill whichwas in a technical sense an acceptable basis for legislation.4. The Legislation Committee have now completed their examination ofthe Bill, which has been prepared under the close supervision of the Attorney-General. Although the draft Bill, as it has emerged from numerous revisions,is in as satisfactory a form as can in practice be devised, I concur in the Attorney-GeneraFs view that it remains a formidably complex, and inevitably obscure,measure which is bound to present difficulties in its passage through Parliament.The President of the Board of Trade is advised that these difficulties are comparable to those which confronted the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill in the last session.The Cabinet will no doubt wish to take this into account in reaching their decisionon the desirability of proceeding with the Bill.51281
5. If it is decided not to proceed with a comprehensive Credit Trading Billon the lines previously proposed, there remains the question whether we should introduce a shorter measure to provide powers to control hire-purchase tradingas such. Part I of the present draft Bill could be readily adapted for this purpose.The Government are becoming increasingly vulnerable to challenge in regardto new Orders for the control of hire-purchase trading (as well as the reintroduction of petrol rationing) which are made under the Defence Regulations; we are pledged to repeal all the Defence Regulations, replacing them as necessary with permanent legislation, during the life-time of the present Parliament, and the provisions inthe Credit Trading Bill form virtually the only instalment of such legislation whichis provided for in the programme for the current session. It must be recognised,however, that the inclusion of a Credit Trading Bill in the session&apos;s programme was based on the importance which was attached to bringing the activities of the hire-purchase finance houses under closer control. If these provisions are nowto be dropped it may be felt that, in face of the prospective congestion in theParliamentary time-table and the added burden of legislation on the national health Service, sufficient priority cannot be accorded to the need for securingpermanent powers to control hire-purchase trading as such to justify a separate bill on this subject.6.   Decisions of the Cabinet are therefore sought on (a) Whether or not to proceed with the comprehensive Credit TradingBill, as at present drafted, in the current session.(b) If it is decided not to proceed with that Bill, whether to introduce a shorter measure providing permanent powers to control hire-purchase trading as such.K.House of Lords, S.W. 1,28th February, 1957.
