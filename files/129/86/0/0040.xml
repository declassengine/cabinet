REMUNERATION OF DOCTORS AND DENTISTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Healthhave set out the case for giving the doctors a l\ per cent interim increase (C.(57) 89).    There are however very good reasons, in my view,for us to stick to 5 per cent, and my colleagues should consider them:-(a) I would have thought that, against the present industrial background, 7-g- per cent will cause a widespread feeling of grievance.    I am sure thatit will do so in the field of the non-industrialpublic services, universities and others, who willpress for corresponding increases.    And so it will go on.(b) The extra z\ per cent will not appease the die-hards;  and the moderates will be greatly strengthened by an interim increase of any sort.(c) l\ per cent is not much less than the figure onwhich the Government could very likely have got a negotiated settlement without having a RoyalCommission at all.(d) General practitioners are now drawing 237 per cent of what they earned before the war.    I know of nosalaried professional class in public employment or in employment largely paid from public fundswhich, even in 1957, enjoys such an increase on its pre-war pay.    The general practitioners have had it since 1951.    l\ per cent will give them 255 per cent of their pre-war earnings.     Can we be sure that thisis not more than the Royal Commission would beprepared to award them?(e) Each 1 per cent adds nearly  1 million to the risingcost of the National Health Service.P.T.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.COPY NO.CABINET5th April, 1957.secret.(57) 905th April, 1957
