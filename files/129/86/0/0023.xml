1AGRICULTURE ACT, 1947ANNUAL REVIEW AND DETERMINATION of guarantees, 1957I. introduction. The 1957 Annual Review of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry has now been held in accordance with Section 2of the Agriculture Act, 1947. The long-term assurances for agricultureannounced by the Government in November, 1956, (Cmnd. 23) have con-stituted a new feature which has set a minimum to the Governments deter-determinations following an annual review. Effect has also been given to thedecision, associated with the long-term assurances, that the determination ofcrop price guarantees after an annual review should in future be for the immediately following harvest instead of for that of the succeeding year.2. In the light of the Annual Review, and in accordance with these new arrangements, the Government have now determined the guarantees for livestock and livestock products for the year April, 1957, to March, 1958,and for crops from the 1957 harvest; the determinations for the 1957 cropssupersede those made under previous procedure following the 1956 annual review.  The determinations are set out in Appendix V.II. Economic Condition of the Agricultural IndustryProduction Progress3. Agricultural net output continues to increase. For the.year 1956/57it is forecast at 59 per cent above pre-war, as compared with a revisedfigure of 56 per cent for 1955/56, largely as a result of a rise in the outputof livestock products, and notably of milk, eggs and beef.4. The main features of production at present are expansion in the pro-duction of beef, mutton and lamb ; relative stability in the output of pigmeat,though with some indication of an increase in the future; and a stronglycontinuing upward trend in the output of milk and eggs. The decline inthe arable and tillage areas was arrested in 1956, at least for the timebeing, and the long-term improvement in crop yields appears to be continuing.Changes in Income5. The forecast of actual net income for 1956/57 is  317 million, corn-pared with a revised figure of  325 million for 1955/56. When adjustedfor normal weather conditions, net income is estimated at  334 million for1956/57; the comparable figure for 1955/56 was  306J million. Althoughactual.net income is slightly below that of last year, net income Under normal weather conditions is forecast to be about equal to the highest previouslyrecorded, in 1952/53.Changes in Costs6. The prices of many goods and services used in agricultural productionhave again risen. The aggregate effect of such changes, as calculated forthe purposes of the Annual Review, is shown in Appendix III. The total net increase since the last Review amounts to nearly  38 million for reviewcommodities&apos; out of a total of some  48 million for all commodities. Ineach case these totals exclude higher feed costs (about  11 million) on pigs and eggs which are reflected, automatically in adjustments to the guaranteesior. these commodities.. The. amount of  38 million for review commoditiesis the figure that is allowed for in the minimum assurance relating to thetotal value of the guarantees.
1617. These calculations are made on the conventions that the price changes are effective for a full year and that the usage of goods and services doesnot alter as a result of greater efficiency or any other factor. They arethen taken broadly into account at the Annual Review, along with theother relevant factors. Among these are that some part of the increased costs will have already affected net income in the current year 1956/57, and some are likely to be temporary in their effect. There is also the annual increasein efficiency, arising iprimarily from improvements in husbandry and farmmanagement. This can only be estimated broadly but in the governments view can be taken to be about  25 million a year for review commodities.Economic Condition of the Industry8. The Governments assessment of the economic condition of the industryis as follows. The increasing trend of output has been resumed and, subjectto variations in the weather, the net income of the industry shows signs ofincreasing. This is in large measure due to continued improvement in theefficiency of the industry which, together with increases in the value of the guarantees that have been made in the last two years, has offset substantialcost increases. The prospects are that the durable effects of the cost increasessince the last Annual Review will be substantial, but so should be the continuing increase in efficiency. The essential needs of the industry canbe met by an increase in the value of the guarantees less, in relation tothe cost increases than in the last two years.III. Production and Guarantee Policy9. Production and guarantee policy has been reviewed in the light notonly of all the relevant domestic considerations but also of the country&apos;international trading position, especially in relation to the Commonwealth.The policy of the Government is set out in the immediately following paragraphs.Production Policy10. The major objective continues to be that production should be more economic. This calls for a selective expansion of net output with the mainemphasis on the substitution of home-grown feedingstuffs, including grass,for imports, and on economies generally in the use of imported materials.Such substitution and economy would be at least as effective in increasingnet output as any expansion of gross output; and at the same time wouldmake a surer contribution to relieving the balance of payments.11. A steady improvement in the competitive position of the industrycontinues to be the long-term aim. In so far as the greater and better useof home-grown products, especially grass, should reduce unit costs of produc-tion, it should help the industry towards that aim and meet the present needsof the national economy. The strengthening of the industry&apos;s competitive position will also depend on its success in increasing efficiency generally,meeting consumer choice and improving the quality of produce.12. In the light of these considerations, the main directions in which themaintenance or expansion of net output should be sought are: (i) the maintenance of a large arable acreage, of something like thecurrent size, but with more emphasis on feed crops ;(ii) reliance to a greater extent, for the maintenance of a large livestockpopulation, on home-produced resources ;(iii) production of more good quality beef, and lamb, but no moremilk, eggs, pigfneat or wheat. Indeed, in present circumstances, lessmilk and eggs than the quantities at present in prospect are needed.
Exchequer Cost13. The total cost of the support to agriculture during the current financialyear about  245 million is substantially greater than in 1955/56 about 205 million. Present production and market prospects, together with the costof the proposed farm improvement scheme, indicate that this total is likelyto rise further. It is essential therefore that, within the scope allowed by thelong-term assurances, designed to provide a sound basis for planning in theindustry, everything possible should be done to keep down the burden of cost that the taxpayer will continue to have to bear.IV. Determination of GuaranteesLong-Term Assurances14. In providing long-term assurances to the industry the Government have undertaken that the determinations made after each annual review will be such as to maintain the total value of the guarantees at not less than 97  percent of their total value in the preceding year, after allowing for cost changes that have occurred on review commodities since the last annual review, andto maintain the guaranteed price for each commodity at not less than 96 percent of that determined after the preceding annual review.15. The total value of the guarantees (including relevant production grants)for this purpose at the 1957 Annual Review was calculated to be  1,197million and 97J per cent of this is  1,167 million. After the addition of the relevant cost increase of nearly  38 million, the lower limit for theGovernments determination would be an increase of just under  8 million in the total value of the guarantees.16. For the purposes of the long-term assurances, in relation both to thetotal value of the guarantees and to the guarantees for individual commodities,the comparison is between (i) the determinations now made for 1957/58 and(ii) those made for 1956/57-after the 1956 Annual Review in the case of livestock and livestock products, and after the 1955 Annual Review in thecase of crops. The determinations for 1957/58 include, changes amountingto a net increase of  3  million in crop price guarantees determined afterthe 1956 Annual Review; these were not due to take effect until&apos; 1957/58.Governments Conclusions17. The national economic situation has required that the Governmentshould take a strict view of the needs of the industry. After considering all relevant factors, including the long-term assurances and the need to enablethe industry to continue to play its full part in the national economy, theGovernment have decided that the total value of the guarantees should beincreased by some  14 million.Determinations made in the light of the Annual Review18. The determinations to be made were (i) those for livestock and livestock products for the year April, 1957, to March, 1958, and (ii) a reconsideration of those for crops of the 1957 harvest already determined under previousprocedure after the 1956 Annual Review. The Government had undertaken to look again at these crop price guarantee determinations, to considerwhether any upward adjustment was justified in the light of all relevantcircumstances at the present time, as part of the arrangements for changingover to the determination of these each year for the immediately followingharvest. The crop price guarantees now determined for the 1957 harvestaccordingly supersede those previously determined after the 1956 annual review (Cmd. 9721).32907
16319. The increase in the total value of the guarantees for 1957/58 comparedwith that for 1956/57 is some  6 million above the minimum increaserequired, as between those two years, under the long-term assurances. Thedeterminations for the particular commodities are set out in Appendix V.In the case of those four commodities for which there is a reduction inthe guarantee for 1957/58 as compared with that for 1956/57, the deter-determinations are within the limits set by the new assurance related to the guarantees for individual commodities. The main features of the determina-tions are as follows.Livestock Products20. Production of milk has been increasing rapidly with no parallelincrease in liquid consumption. Supplies for manufacture, produced at considerable expense in imported feed, now threaten to exceed the availablemanufacturing capacity at the peak period, while abundant supplies of milk products are available from Commonwealth countries which are particularly suited to the production of those commodities. Some reductionin output is therefore needed in the national interest and this must be sought by a reduction of profitability. The average return per gallon to producershas already been reduced by about l^d. in the current year because the guaranteed price to each milk marketing board is related to a standard quantity. Further, profitability is being affected by significant cost increases,although these are partly offset by improvements in efficiency. Nevertheless,the Government have concluded that the over-riding requirements of pro-duction policy make it essential, in spite of these increased costs, to do no more than increase the guaranteed price for milk by ^d. per gallon and make a minor adjustment in the standard &quot;quantity for England and Wales.They recognise that this will mean in 1957/58 a further net reduction inprofitability per gallon at the current level of output..2L. The substantial increase in the output of eggs, also produced at con-siderable expense in imported feed, has weakened the market at an excessiveand increasing cost to the Exchequer. The aim must therefore be to reducethe output now in prospect at the current guaranteed price. This requires areduction in profitability. It has accordingly been decided that the guaranteeon hen eggs must be reduced by lfd. per dozen a substantial cut, yet withinthe long-term assurances.22. The increases in the guarantees on fat cattle and fat sheep shouldhave the broad effect of at least maintaining profitability. No increase inthe guarantee on fat pigs can be justified. The guarantee has been leftunchanged and, taking account of the fact that the price guarantee variesautomatically according to changes in feed costs which constitute the largestelement in the cost of production, this should leave profitability much thesame as at present. The wool guarantee is in a special category as it is associated with stabilisation arrangements. If these are to work effectivelythe guaranteed price should not remain continually above the market priceas it has been since the first year of the present guarantee arrangements. Butin view of the recent firmer tone of the market the guaranteed price hasnot been changed this year.23. The Government have decided that, as from the beginning of 1957/58,special young cows will no longer be eligible for the guarantee. This is inaccordance with the policy that the fatstock guarantees should apply onlyto clean stock of the quality required by the market. In compensation forthis change, the standard price for fat cattle has been increased further than would otherwise have been the case.
24. There is still a need for more good quality beef but it is increasingly important that production should be of the better bred and fed animalsmarketed at the most desired weights. The Government have therefore decidedto introduce for 1957/58 a scheme for encouraging, through the guarantees,the production of better quality beef animals. Accordingly most of theincrease in the standard price for 1957/58 will be used to provide a higher rate of guarantee on steers and heifers of certain standards and weights.This rate will be 5s. Od. per live cwt. higher than the rate on other eligiblecattle. The working of this scheme will be reviewed at the 1958 annual review.25. As already announced, new arrangements for calculating guaranteepayments on fatstock will come into operation on 25th March, 1957. these new arrangements, and the other changes in the fatstock guarantees whichwill take effect in 1957/58, are explained in Appendix V.26.; Special circumstances apply this year to the determination of the guaranteed prices for eggs. The British Egg Marketing Scheme came intoforce on the 31st December, 1956, but the result of the producers&apos; poll todecide whether the Scheme shall remain in force will not be known untilearly in April. If the Scheme remains in force, the guarantee will be imple-mented through the Egg Marketing Board. If the Scheme ceases to haveeffect, the Government will introduce a deficiency payments scheme toreplace the present interim system. In either event the present interim arrangements will continue during the first part of 1957/58. The determina-tions in respect of eggs set out in Appendix V provide accordingly.Crops27. At a time when there are large wheat surpluses, especially in theCommonwealth, the Government wish to see relatively less wheat in the cereals acreage. Accordingly the revised guaranteed prices for wheat, andalso rye, for the 1957 harvest have been determined at the minimum per-mitted under the long-term assurance. Increases in the price guarantees forthe other crops barley, oats, potatoes and sugar beet have already been promised following the 1956 Annual Review under previous procedure.These have also been reconsidered and it has been decided to increasefurther the guaranteed price for oats, which are of value as home-grownfeed and are of importance to many small farmers.28. It has been agreed that the basis of the guarantee for barley shouldbe simplified and brought into line with those for the other cereals. Startingwith the 1957 crop, the average realised price of barley will be calculatedby reference to all recorded sales. Hitherto only sales at or below a ceilingprice have been included in the calculation. Since sales of higher-pricedbarley will in future be included in the calculation of the average realisedprice, the standard price for barley has had to be raised to a level appro-priate to the new basis, but this adjustment does not alter the effectivevalue of the guarantee.29. The basis of the guarantee for potatoes of the 1957 crop remainsas determined after the 1956 Annual Review. It has, however, been agreedthat starting with the 1958 crop the size of the riddle for guarantee purposesshall be increased from 1  inches to If inches to bring it more into line with the requirements of the market. The Government have also given notice of their intention to consider whether any alteration should be madefor the 1958 crop in the system of implementing the guarantee for potatoes.%32907 A 3
165Production Grants30. The Government have reviewed the existing production grants which now amount to nearly  70 million a year and have decided that, since supplyprospects now make it practicable, some further encouragement to the useof nitrogenous fertilisers can be given. From 1st July next increased ratesof subsidy will be fixed for nitrogen involving (on the rate of consumption in the current year) additional payments of some  3 million in aggregate.Minor extensions will also be made in the scope of the ploughing grants andthe lime subsidy.V. Effect of Determinations31. The effect of any particular determinations on the net income of theindustry is difficult to forecast in conditions of a free economy. commodity prices and production grants are not the only factors affecting net income,which must be expected to fluctuate from year to year. The determinationsnow made increase the total value of the guarantees by  14 million. Inthe Governments opinion these determinations will enable the industry tomaintain its progress in improving efficiency and to secure a reasonablelevel of remuneration for economic production, and at the same time accord with the present stringent requirements of the national economy.
APPENDICESSome of the estimates given in these Appendices differ from those in previous white Papers on Annual Reviews because of later information, improvements inmethods of estimation and changes in the sources of data.APPENDIX it able agricultural Production in the United Kingdom(Years beginning 1st June)	Unit	Pre-war	1946/47	1953/54	1954/55	1955/56	1956/57 (fore-cast)		average					Crop acreages: Wheat	&apos;000 acres	1,856	2,062	2,217	2,457	1,948	2,283Rye......

The &quot; Departmental &quot; estimate is built up fromstatistics of income and expenditure for the whole &quot; national&quot; farm, whereas the&quot; raised sample &quot; is based on some 3,600 actual farm accounts, which are expanded or &quot; raised &quot; to give an aggregate for all farms in the United Kingdom. There area number of reasons why the levels of aggregate net income shown in these two series should vary but it is difficult to make a quantitative assessment of the individualcauses. Both series are of value in indicating the general trend in the level of income.

The figures given above exclude  11-46 million in respect of additionalfeedingstuffs costs which are dealt with automatically by the feed formulae which relate the guarantees for pigs and eggs to the cost of standard rations.Note (iii). The figures for machinery include  12-80 million (all products) and 10-25 million (review products) for increases in the cost of machinery fuels andoils. Of these amounts  5-53 million and  4-43 million respectively relate to direct payment by farmers of the temporary increase in the tax on petrol introduced in December, 1956.Note (iv). In addition to the cost changes listed above, account has been taken of the expiry in 1956 of the Hill Cattle Subsidy in England and Wales and NorthernIreland. Payments under this head are forecast at approximately  350,000 in 1956/57.Note (v). The expression &quot;Review Products&quot; means commodities within theFirst Schedule of the Agriculture Act, 1947, of the grades and descriptions eligiblefor guarantee.

The feed price under the existing feed formulahas increased from 31s. 2d. to 33s. 6d. per cwt. Account has also to be taken,however, of the fact that the feed formula has itself been revised (see paragraph 7of Part II of this Appendix). The current feed price related to the revised formulais 31s. 5d. per cwt., as compared with 33s. 6d. on the existing feed formula. the guaranteed price for 1957/58 of 51s. lid. per score, relating to the current feed price and revised feed formula, is equivalent to 49s. 7d. per score on the basis of the feedprice and feed formula to which the 1956/57 guaranteed price was related.(2) The guaranteed prices for hen and duck eggs for 1957/58, shown in column (iii)of Table A above, each include an adjustment of 1-Jd. per dozen on account of increases in feed prices since the last Annual Review. The feed price under theexisting feed formula has increased from 29s. 8d. to 31s. 4d. per cwt. Account hasalso to be taken, however, of the fact that the feed formula has itself been revised(see paragraph 11 of Part II of this Appendix). The current feed price related to the revised formula is 29s. lOd. per cwt., as compared with 31s. 4d. on the existing feedformula. The guaranteed prices for 1957/58 of 4s. l^d. per dozen for hen eggs and2s. 5d. per dozen for duck eggs, related to the current feed price and revised feedformula, are equivalent to 3s. 1 lfd. and 2s. 3 d. per dozen respectively on the basisof the feed price and feed formula to which the 1956/57 guaranteed prices were related.(3) Guaranteed prices for crops of the 1957 harvest were originally determined,under previous procedure, in the light of the 1956 Annual Review and announced in cmd. 9721. In accordance with their undertaking in paragraph 5 (iv) of the white paper on Long-Term Assurances for Agriculture (Cmnd. 23), the Government have
reconsidered those original determinations to see whether any upward adjustment isnecessary in the light of current circumstances. The price changes shown in column (ii)of Table B above show the net effect of the changes originally made after the 1956Annual Review and the upward adjustments now made in the light of reconsiderationafter the 1957 Annual Review. The guaranteed prices for the 1957 harvest shown in column (iii) of Table B supersede those determined after the 1956 Annual Review.(4) The guaranteed price for barley of the 1957 harvest, shown in column (iii) of table B above, includes in addition to the increase of 6d. per cwt. shown in column (ii) an upward adjustment of 2s. 6d. per cwt. to offset the effect which the new arrange-ments for calculating the average realised price would otherwise have on the effectivevalue of the guarantee (see paragraph 28 of this Command Paper).(5) The guaranteed prices for fat cattle, fat sheep, eggs and wheat are averageprices subject to variation seasonally and, in some cases, by grades. Because themarket for these products cannot be accurately forecast, producers&apos; average returnsunder the guarantees in any year may be rather more or less than the guaranteed prices. Paragraph 30 of Part II of this Appendix deals with a similar point in respectof potatoes.
Part II. Additional Details of GuaranteesFatstock1. The standard prices will apply to steers and heifers, to lambs and other cleansheep, and to clean home-bred pigs of the same qualifications as those covered bythe Fatstock Guarantee Scheme, 1956-57 ; special young cows will no longer be eligible for guarantee payments. The upper weight limits for guarantee payments in respect of eligible stock will remain unchanged.2. As already announced, a new method of calculating guarantee payments forfatstock will come into operation at the beginning of the 1957/58 fatstock year on 25th March, 1957. For cattle and sheep, the standard prices shown inoolumn (iii) of Table A of this Appendix will be broken down into weeklyseasonal standard prices which will be specified later: the rate of guaranteepayment in each case will be the amount by which the average of the latest four weeks&apos; actual market prices and the estimated market prices for the following four weeks falls short of the average of the seasonal standard prices for the same eight weeks. For pigs, there will be no seasonal scale, and the rate of guaranteepayment will be the amount by which the standard price shown in column (iii)of Table A of this Appendix exceeds the average of the latest four weeks&apos; actualmarket prices and the estimated market prices for the following four weeks,including quality premiums.3. The rate of guarantee payment for each group of stock will be calculatedweekly and announced before the beginning of the week to which it relates.The rate of payment will be subject to a stabilising adjustment in any week in which this ds necessary to ensure that the average return to producers doesnot differ from the respeotive standard price (in the case of cattle and sheep; thestandard price for the week in question) by more than. Steers and heifers and clean sheep imported, removed or brought into theUnited Kingdom will become eligible for guarantee payments after three monthsof entering the United Kingdom. For the purpose of calculating rates of guarantee payments on such stock the appropriate standard prices will be treatedas reduced by 3s. 6d. per live cwt. for steers and heifers and by -Id. per lb. dressedcarcase weight for sheep.5. The weekly rate of guarantee payment for steers and heifers calculated asin paragraph 2 above will be an average rate. For 1957/58 there will be a higher rate of payment for Grade I, which will be 5s. Od. per live cwt. more than thelower rate for other eligible cattle. The standard of eligibility for Grade I andthe method of calculating the two rates of payment each week will be announcedseparately.6. As already announced, two rates of quality premium will be payable onpigs of certain weights with Grade A fat measurement at all points and of aminimum length (measured from the junction of the first tab and sternum to thelower edge of the aitchbone) of 775 mm. and which are sold on grade and dead-weight and certified at approved bacon factories. The weight ranges will be  sc.-8 sc. 15 lb. from 25th March, 1957 and 7 sc.-8 sc. 5 lb. with effect from16th September, 1957. A premium of 3s. Od. per score deadweight will be payable on such pigs with a length measurement of not less than 800 mm. ; a premiumof 2s. Od. per score deadweight will be payable on such pigs with a lengthmeasurement of less than 800 mm. but not less than 775 mm.7. As in previous years, the rate of guarantee payments for pigs will be subjectto adjustment in accordance with the operation of a feedingstuffs formula. Thestandard price shown in column (iii) of Table, A is: related to a price of 31s. 5d.Cattle7s.   0d. per live cwt.2d. per lb. dressed carcase weight.4s.   Od. per score deadweight.SheepPigs
per cwt. for a prescribed standard feed ration ; this will be different from that used in previous years and will comprise:  Per cent.Feeding wheat     ...............      20Barley meal ...............      40Feeding oats        ...      ...      ......      ...      10Maize meal.........      ......      ...      ioWheat offals .&apos;..............      10White fish meal    ......      ......      ...       5Extracted soya bean meal        .........        5The average price of the standard feed ration will be calculated every week inrespect of the preceding period of 12 weeks (not 24 weeks as hitherto). Foreach change of Id. per cwt. in the price of the standard feed ration a correspond-ing change of Id. per score deadweight will be made in the rate of guaranteepayment.8. It was stated in paragraph 27 of the White Paper on the Annual review and Determination of Guarantees, 1955 (Cmd. 9406) that the Government andthe Farmers&apos; Unions had agreed that capital expenditure on pig progeny testingstations, then estimated at  450,000, should be taken into account in arriving at the global guarantee payments to pig producers in Great Britain in thefinancial year 1955/56 and subsequent years. The latest estimate of this expenditure is  700,000. The reduction in guarantee payments in Great britain in 1957/58 to take account of this expenditure will, as in 1955/56 and 1956/57,be at the rate of Id. per score deadweight.Eggs9. As at present, the guarantee will apply to first quality eggs (subject to an appropriate deduction for dirty eggs otherwise of first quality) but not to heneggs weighing less than 1  oz.10. The prices for hen and duck eggs shown in columns (i) and (iii) of table A of this Appendix are prices guaranteed to producers on the basis ofthe present interim arrangements, for so long as these arrangements continue.Seasonal prices to producers will be fixed in relation to the prices in column(iii), market prices, and the policy of injecting subsidy at a fairly uniform ratethroughout the year.11. As in previous years, the guaranteed prices for eggs will be subject toadjustment in accordance with the operation of a feedingstuffs formula. the guaranteed prices to producers shown in column (iii) of Table A, are related to a price of 29s. lOd. per cwt. for a prescribed standard feed ration ; this willbe different from that used in previous years and will comprise : Per cent.Feeding wheat     .........      ...      ... 20Feeding barley      ...      ...      ......      ... 10Feeding oats         ......      ......      ... 20Maize        ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 15Wheat offals        ............... 20White fish meal    .....,      ...      ...      ... 5Extracted soya bean meal        ......      ... 10The average price of the standard feed ration will be calculated every four weeks in respect of the preceding period of 12 weeks (not 32 weeks as hitherto).For each change of 7d. per cwt. in the price of the standard feed ration acorresponding change of  d. per dozen will be made in the appropriate guaranteed price.12. The first and second instalments (totalling  377,000) of the capital cost of setting up poultry progeny testing stations have been recovered in 1955/56 and1956/57 by reductions in the payments made in Great Britain under the guarantee arrangements for hen eggs. The final instalment, which will not exceed  253,000,will similarly be recovered in 1957/58.
13. The guarantee will apply:  (a) under guarantee arrangements operated by the Government, to eligibleeggs sold through licensed packing stations ;(b) under guarantee arrangements operated by an Egg Marketing Board, toeligible eggs sold to the Board through packing stations.14. If, in the light of the producers&apos; poll, the British Egg Marketing Schemeremains in force, the guarantee for hen and duck eggs will be implementedthrough the British Egg Marketing Board in accordance with a financial agree-ment to be concluded between the Government and the Board. For this purpose the following determinations have been made:  (i) the guaranteed prices to the Board for 1957/58, equivalent to the guaranteed prices to producers shown dn column (iii) of Table A (subjectto the profit and loss arrangements described in paragraph 15 below),would be:  Hen eggs.............     4s.   6-2d. per doz.Duck eggs        ...      ...      ...    2s. 10-2d. per doz.These prices include an allowance for the Board&apos;s administrative costs in operating the guarantee arrangements and marketing expenses (includingpackers&apos; margins, packaging costs, transport and, in the case of heneggs, certain trading losses) ;(ii) the estimated average selling price for fresh hen eggs delivered to whole-wholesalers in 1957/58 is 2s. lOd. per dozen: the estimated average selling price for duck eggs sold in shell by the Government and the Board in1957/58 is 2s. 5-7d. per dozen ;(iii) the flat rates of subsidy payable to the Board in accordance with thefinancial arrangements that would operate in the event of the EggMarketing Scheme remaining in force have been determined asfollows:  Hen eggs............     Is.   8-2d. per doz.Duck eggs        ...      ...      ... 4-5d. per doz.These have been calculated by subtracting from the guaranteed prices to the Board in (i) above the estimated average selling prices in (ii)above.15. Subject to the terms of the financial agreement, the flat rate subsidies inparagraph 14 (iii) above will be paid to the Board in respect of eggs qualifying for the guarantee after the Board has taken over operation of the guarantee arrangements. The financial agreement will provide for a profit and loss sharingarrangement under which adjustments will be made in the rate of subsidy ifrealisations for fresh eggs, calculated as provided in the financial agreement, differby more than 2d. per dozen from the estimated average selling prices specifiedin paragraph 14 (ii) above.16. If, in the light of the producers&apos; poll, the Egg Marketing Scheme ceases to have effect, the Government propose to replace the present interim arrange-ments with a deficiency payments system under which the standard prices forhen and duck eggs for the year as a whole would be the guaranteed prices to producers shown in column (iid) of Table A. These prices are on the basis of free collection from producers within ten miles of the packing station. Detailsof the deficiency payments arrangements would be worked out dn consultationwith the interests concerned.17. Under any guarantee arrangements that replace the present interim systemeffect will be given to the factors set out in paragraphs 9 to 13 above.Wool18. As for 1956/57, the guaranteed price will be an average price per lb. tobe received by the British Wool Marketing Board for home-produced fleece woolfrom the 1957 clip. The guarantee will be implemented dn accordance withthe provisions of the financial agreement concluded in November, 1955, betweenthe Government and the Board.
Milk19. The guarantee for milk in 1957/58 will be on broadly the same basis asin 1956/57. . .20. As in previous years, Ohe average guaranteed price for the United kingdom will be broken down into separate guaranteed prices for each of the five marketingareas in the United Kingdom; and the guaranteed price for each area will again be related to a standard quantity of milk for that area. The standard quantitiesfor 1957/58 wild be the same as for 1956/57 except that for England and wales the standard quantity will he 1,6544- million gallons instead of 1,651 million gallons.21. For each area the guaranteed price will be broken down into a higher price for a primary proportion and a lower price for the remainder of the milk.   The higher and lower prices will be specified later.Cereals22. All the guaranteed prices for cereals are on the basis of a deficiency round scheme similar to that now in operation.23. The standard price of wheat will be subject to seasonal variations onbroadly the same lines as ait present.24. As stated in paragraph 28 of this Command Paper all recorded growers&apos;sales of barley will be taken into account in calculating the average realisedprice of barley for the purposes of the Deficiency Payments Scheme.25. There will be no change in the reductions applied to the United kingdom average yields of barley and oats on account of unmerchantable grain.Potatoes26. The guarantee will apply to ware potatoes of the 1957 crop. The definition,as announced in the White Paper on the Annual Review and Determination of guarantees, 1956 (Cmd. 9721), will be:-&quot; (i) ware potatoes are potatoes which do not include more than 25 percent by weight of potatoes affected by growth cracks and which are free from:  (a) small potatoes ;(b) frost, greening and growth shoots ;(c) soil, dirt and other extraneous matter ;(d) damage by wire worms and slugs and disease other thancommon scab ;(e) any other damage or defect whatsoever rendering them unfit for sale for human consumption.Provided that potatoes shall be deemed to be ware potatoes if in anyone purported hundredweight of ware potatoes the total weight of soil,dirt and any other extraneous matter and of potatoes excluded by (a)to (e) of the above definition does not together exceed six lb.(ii) &quot; Small potatoes&quot; means potatoes which will pass without manipula-tion through a riddle operated horizontally which has a square meshmeasuring between the wires one and a half inches along each sideof the square.&quot;27. As already announced, there will be no guarantee for sub-standard potatoes.28. The guaranteed price is an average support price for the United Kingdom,and will be converted into average regional support prices for the three marketingregions of England and Wales, for Scotland and for Northern Ireland whichwill be announced later.29. The regional support prices will be varied seasonally. There will be novariation according to variety or soil classification.
30. Delivery of most potatoes bought under the guarantee will generally be taken during the latter part of the season, in order to give producers thefullest possible opportunity to do better on the open market than the supportprice. The average price paid for potatoes actually bought on support is onthis account likely to be higher than the guaranteed price shown in column(iii) of Table B of this Appendix, since the guaranteed price will be converted into a scale of prices rising throughout the season.Sugar Beet31. As in previous years, the guaranteed price shown in column (iii) of Table b of this Appendix is related to beet of 16-5 per cent sugar content. The pricedifferential, plus or minus for each one per cent sugar content, will continueto be 7s. 6d. per ton.32. The guarantee will continue to apply to the produce of the acreage con-tracted for by the British Sugar Corporation, in agreement with the Government:and for the 1957 harvest this acreage will be, as in recent years, approximately400,000 acres in England and Wales and 15,000 acres in Scotland.33. In England and Wales the British Sugar Corporation will bear rail transport costs in excess of the railway freight charges for 40 miles current at thetime of delivery of the sugar beet to the factory, but will bear no part ofthe cost of transporting sugar beet by road. As in previous years, to take account of the transport terms in the Corporation^ contract for the purchaseof sugar beet for processing at its Scottish factory, the price on which this contract is based will be Is. 9d. per ton less than the guaranteed price.(32907)   Wt. 1599-6339   K72   3/57   D.L.
