(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 93COPY NO.12th April, 1957CABINETSHOPS bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Lord Privy SealOn 26th March the Cabinet approved my provisional proposalsfor amending the Shops Bill in the House of Lords   (C.C.(57) 24thConclusions, Minute 4).     I have given further consideration to thismatter and am in some doubt whether clause 1 of the Bill should bemore radically amended than I suggest in Paragraph 2 below.    In viewof uncertainty about the future of the Bill I think we should pause beforeindulging in a conflict with the Opposition without by any means whollysatisfying our own supporters.2.     I therefore propose that we should excise that part of cla.use which gives local authorities power to make the closing hours earlier than 8 p. m. on the late day and 7 p. m. on other days.    We shouldalso omit the powers to fix different times for different trades andto make other variations which are liable to be confusing.    LordColeraine suggested the removal of these powers in the House of Lordsduring the Committee Stage and I think it would be a step in the right direction if his suggestion were accepted.    The Opposition will not like it,but they will be unable to deny that the Bill will still be a great improve- .ment on the present law from their point of view.3.      t have also considered what further amendments might be madeto meet the views of our supporters and others who  have complainedabout certain provisions in the Bill.    These, together with the amendment to clause 1, are indicated in the Annex.i.     As an alternative course of action, I have examined thepossibility of restricting the scope of the Bill to provisions remedyingsome of the worst imperfections of the present law while avoiding thecontroversial question of the evening closing hour.    I have come tothe conclusion, however, that this would do little to clarify the law,might even lead to worse confusion, and would certainly not avoidmajor controversy.5.      I ask my colleagues&apos; approval to the tabling of the amendmentsindicated in the Annex in the House of Lords.    The question whether itwill prove practicable to get the Bill through Parliament in the present session will have to be reviewed later in the light of the reactions tothese amendments and to circumstances of Parliamentary time.Meanwhile I think we should carry through with the Minister ofEducation&apos;s undertaking to get on with the business in the Lords.R .A.B.&apos;Home Office, S.W.I.11th April, 1957.
ANNEXSHOPS BILLProposed Amendments in the House of LordsClause IThis should be amended so as to remove the power of localauthorities to fix earlier general closing hours than those laid down in clause 1.    This will consequentially remove the local authorities&apos; powerto differentiate between different trades and so on.Clause 4(a) At present this clause allows a local authority in a holiday resort to fix an evening closing hour on week-days during the season not later than 8 p. m. (9 p. m. on the late day), i. e. , up to one hour later than thegeneral hours at present prescribed by clause 1.     This should be amended so as to allow a local authority to suspend the operation of closing hourprovisions altogether on week-days during the season, so enabling shops tokeep open as late as they like.(b) This clause should also be amended so as to remove the differentialsfor different trades and so bring it into line with clause 1 in this respect.Clauses 7, 8, 9 and 37It has been represented in the Lords that more liberal provision should be made.for the abolition of early closing days during the christmas shopping rush, and that corresponding provision should bemade for the shopping rush before Easter.    It has also been suggested thatthe abolition of early closing days should not be made dependent on the shops being closed on the public holidays during these periods.    Amend-ments should be made to meet these points and in order to meet the wishes of some shops1 organisations similar provision should also be made forthe period before every public holiday.    It will then be possible to scrapclause 9, which has been widely attacked on the ground that it is verycomplex and obscure, and clause 8 as well.A logical consequence of making these amendments will be toprovide for the assistanfs half holiday which is due to be given in theweek before each public holiday to be postponed.     Following representa-tions in the House of Lords employers should be enabled to give thecompensatory half holiday in advance as an alternative to postponing it.Clauses 11 and 12In order to implement the undertaking already given in the Houseof Lords, confectionery, tobacco and smokers&apos; requisites should be addedto the goods which shops can sell at any time if they get registered under clause 11.    A corresponding amendment should be made to clause 12 soas to apply this concession to vans, etc.
Clause IS (England and Wales only)(a) The closing hour provisions in this clause should be brought into line with clause 1 as amended.(b) The exemption for confectionery and tobacco should be carried through to Sundays.Clause ZO (England and Wales only)(a) At present this clause allows a local authority in a holiday resort to make orders enabling certain shops to stay open up to 8 p. m. on sundays during the season.    This should be brought into line withclause 4 as amended so as to enable these shops to keep open as late asthey like on these Sundays.(b) A minor amendment should also be made so as to make it easier for the local authority in a holiday resort to permit food shops tobe open all day on Sundays during the season.Clause 21 (England and Wales only)An amendment should be made so as %e apply the exemption forconfectionery and tobacco to sales by vans, etc. , on Sundays.Clause 26 (England and Wales only)A minor amendment should be made to help enforcement.First and Second SchedulesAmendments should be made to meet the requests in the House ofLords that the sale of flour confectionery and mechanically propelled vehicles,trailers and caravans should be allowed after 1 p. m. on theearly closing day, and that spare parts of trailers and caravans should beallowed to be sold at any time just as spare parts of motor cars, etc.can be under the Second Schedule as it stands.
