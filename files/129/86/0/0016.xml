secret.(57) 6613th March, 1957OIL wSUPPLIESMemorandum by the Minister of PowerLast week the international oil industry advised the organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) that prospects of oil supplies for Western Europe in the three months April to June were as follows:-Under present conditions  -Percentage of normal demandMotor Spirit - 84Gas/Diesel Oil - 107Fuel Oil - 92All main productscombined - 94With Iraq petroleum company pipeline open -Motor Spirit - 90Gas/Diesel Oil - 112Fuel Oil - 99All main productscombined - 100If these supplies materialise each country will receive as a firstallocation these percentages of its normal demand less a contribution of about 7 per cent to 8 per cent to a central pool which will be allocated according to need by the O.E.E.C. Oil Committee.   For thepurpose of the following review of oil supplies in the United Kingdomit is assumed that the United Kingdom will receive from the pool asmuch motor spirit and gas/diesel oil as she contributes to it  -though this is not certain.Motor Spirit2.      United Kingdom stocks are high at present and are expectedto remain fairly stable until the end of the present rationing period on16th April.    The prospects for the second rationing period of 4 months beginning on 17th April under the alternative supply patterns suggestedby the oil industry and under alternative rationing policies may best be illustrated by the consequential stock movements.COPY NO.CABINET

On the other hand the generous stocks and reasonable supply prospects would warrant a substantial increase inpresent rations, even to the point of running down stocks to littleover minimum levels.    So long as the rationing machine remainsoperative it will be possible to tighten up in a subsequent period shouldnormal supplies still not be restored.    The easement suggested at (b)seems the maximum that could safely be announced now and suchannouncement could make it clear that this was without prejudice tothe removal of rationing as soon as normal supplies were in sight.Gas/Diesel Oil3.     Stocks are good, standing at over 800,000 tons or 2 monthssupply at normal demand.    With supply prospects matching normaldemand it should be possible to remove restrictions and still maintain a reasonable stockpile for next winter.    A convenient date for theremoval of restrictions might be 1st April, i. e. a week before the endof the current Derv rationing period.4.     Stocks are reasonably good at 1,400,000 tons but it is essentialthat they should be at a high level and increased if possible againstnext winter*s demand.    With the removal of restrictions stocks would fall whether or not the I.P.C. pipeline is opened.    In these circumstances it would be wise to retain restrictions for the time being subject toreduction of the central heating cut from 25 per cent to 10 per cent(&quot;Central heating&quot; is in fact a water heating load in the summer).(The danger level of stocks is 750,000 tons)Fuel Oil
5. I therefore recommend that we should announce as soon aspossible the following decisi ons:-(i)  Motor Spirit:(ii)  Gas/DieselOil:(iii)   Fuel Oil:Petrol rationing will continue for thepresent but the basic ration for private cars will be increased by 50 per cent(from 200 miles a month to 300) inthe next rationing period (beginning17th April).Restrictions will be removed from1 st April.Restrictions will continue at the present level, except that the central heatingcut will be reduced from 25 per cent to10 per cent from 1st April.M.Ministry of Power, S.W.1.13th March, 1957.-3-
