WILTON PARKMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsThe Existing EstablishmentWilton Park has been operating since 1946 as a collegeat which Germans have had an opportunity of studying the British way of life in general and British policies in particular.    During its existencesome 3,000 German prisoners-of-war passed through it up to 1940.Since 1948 approximately another 3,000 German civilians, including leadingFederal and State politicians, local administrators, judges, trade unionists,etc. have been.    In addition to the Germans some 2 or 300 French, Dutch,Swiss and Belgians have also been.2. The cost of running the establishment has up to now been 41,000 a year.3. It was decided last year mainly in the interests of economy to close down Wilton Park with effect from July 1957.    a subsidiary reason was that it was thought inappropriate to continue an institution in this country primarily for Germans after the occupationstatus had ended.The New Conception4. In the light of more recent developments in Europe, inparticular the need to demonstrate this country&apos;s intention to remainclosely identified with Western Europe and as a result of the reviewof information activities now being carried out, I recommend that thisdecision should be reversed.5. I would wish to retain Wilton park which is widely known and has earned considerable goodwill in its own right as a Europeancollege for the benefit of people of the same types which have come before, from European countries in general.6. The evidence of the influence that Wilton Park has hadover leading Germans has been shown by the reactions which have occurred since the decision to close it was known.    It is clear that thisis an establishment through which considerable opportunities exist to influence opinion in European countries.7. There is little doubt that a contribution to the running of the college could be obtained in future from the Germans and further contributions should be obtained from the other European countries(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)^ *A  ftt *W JHO MSI *M MB MB Mi B13 MA *^ W W DJ MA VM *M&quot; **** BM M* MB i** BW 4M) MB *M) MB ^* **B ^M MB *^B BO *^ MB ^M MB MB MB MM ^M MB MO ^M ^O MB *M* BO *M* ^M 1^ Ml MB BM B ) HBCONFIDENTIAL ^C.(57) 96 COPY NO.13th April, 1957CABINET
likely to benefit.    I think it fair to estimate the continuing liability tothe British Exchequer as between  20 -  25,000 a year.    I am satisfiedthat the return from this expenditure is far greater than from a similarsum spent in some other way for similar purposes.0. I am prepared to find the money required for this financial year by other savings.      i regret having to bring what is aseemingly small matter before my colleagues, but there is a flatdifference of opinion between the Foreign Office and the Treasury onthis matter which has not been resolved by discussions between theChancellor of the Exchequer and myself.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.1.12th April, 1957.
