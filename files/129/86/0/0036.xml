EXPORTS AND prices memorandum by the President of theBoard of trade the 10 per cent rise in the price of the goods and servicessupplied by the nationalised industries, for which the Minister of Powerasks in C.(57) 83, must make exports more difficult to sell.2. In any event wages are going up.   So are bank advances and sales on hire-pur chase.   And private industry is as anxious as nationalised industry to break away from the plateau.   The flight from fixed interestsecurities will begin again.3. All this will look like the last straw to the middle-class.   Theyare in no mood to accept higher taxes and tighter credit in order to save the pound.   They want more money to spend.4. The only antidote to more money is more production.   This could easily be encouraged as industry is ready to expand.   But more outputmeans more imports, and the reserves are too low to stand any worseningin the balance of payments.5. We must sell more exports before we can risk more production.6. Thus according to the rules we should again make it harder tosell at home, and accept the Minister of Power&apos;s proposals as a means tothis end.7, It may be said that this is one of those occasions when theorthodox medicine will make the patient vomit.   I do not agree.   Someinexpensive reliefs to the middle-class could still be given.8. But whether we decide on deflation or expansion we should actin a large and wholehearted manner.   A compromise would win no friends and appease no enemies.D EBoard of Trade, S.W.T.1st April, 1957SECRETC.(57) 861st April, 1957CABINET
