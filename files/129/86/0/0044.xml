ANNEX*     Cmd. 9831k     Functions relating to civil defence and coroners were also among those considered initially, but it was decided, in consultation with the associations, to take no action on these in the present context.LOCAL government functions of County Councils and County district councils in England WaTesIntroduction1. The distribution of functions between county councils andthe councils of county districts (i. e. non-county boroughs, urban districts and rural districts) has been under consideration in connectionwith the proposals for reorganising local government outline din theWhite Paper on Areas and Status of Local Authorities.    * (referred tohereafter as the main White Paper),,2. It was part of the proposals for local government reorganisation which were agreed between representatives of the localauthority associations (and which were printed as an appendix to themain White Paper) that district councils should be empowered toexercise some of the functions at present exercised by county councils.The associations are not, however, agreed on the extent of the changesin this direction which they would like to see made.    What they are agreed on is that a settlement of this matter is a necessary part of anyreorganisation of local government.    This is plainly right.    TheGovernment have now reached certain general conclusions on the subject,which are set out in this Paper.    Their intention is that the paper should provide a basis for discussion with the local authority associations and that, following those discussions, any necessary provision shouldbe made in the Dill which the Government hope to introduce next session on local government reorganisation.3. The functions which have been considered in this context,and which the associations suggested ought to be considered, are thedomiciliary and certain other health and welfare services (under part iii of the National Health Service Act, 1946, and Fart III of theNational Assistance Act, 1948), education (the functions normallyexercised at present by excepted districts), employment of children,classified roads and the bridges thereon, town and country planning(functions under Part III of the Act of 1947, and the preparation of town maps), shops,   theatres and cinemas, food and drugs, milk anddairies, libraries, weights and measures, fertilizers and feeding stuffs,diseases of animals, licensing of waste food boiling plant, and small-holdings.   x4. At present, the responsibility for these functions lies in themain.with the county councils.    As regards some of them, however,certain district councils have a responsibility, either in their own right or by delegation from the county council.    For example, forty-fourborough   and urban district councils already exercise substantial
2mdelegated responsibilities for education under the Education Act, 1944(these are the authorities of the excepted districts); and a much larger number do so for classified roads, having &quot;claimed&quot; them under theLocal Government Act, 1929o    Almost all district councils exercisesome delegated planning powers, though the amount and the method of delegation differs from county to county.    A variety of borough and urban district councils are directly responsible for shops, weights and measures, diseases of animals, food and drugs: the pattern for someof these functions was settled a long time ago and has not been altered.Details of the present responsibility for all the functions in questionnaire shown in the Appendix.The Problem5. The main question is how far the responsibilities of countycouncils for any of these services should be transferred to district councils, and on what basis this should be done.    At the same time,any new arrangements must take into account the question whether someof these functions are at present being discharged by district councilswhich are too small to do so conveniently and effectively.6. In general, the Government are anxious that largerresponsibilities should be entrusted to the district councils.    Thesecouncils are necessarily in closer touch with the people they servethan county councils can be, a factor of particular importance in thecase of those services which intimately affect people&apos;s daily lives -for example, the welfare, health and education services.7. The difficulty, however, is to reconcile a shift ofresponsibility from county councils to district councils with the needsof good administration to-day.    Most of the functions call for highly specialised staff;   some require substantial resources;  and some canbe administered efficiently and economically only on the basis of large areas or populations.    That is why there has been a tendency in recentyears for services like education, health and planning to become theresponsibility of county councils.    Clearly, any proposals forredistribution must have regard to both the quality and the economicaladministration of the services in question.The Government&apos;s proposals. In the main White Paper it was proposed that, in future,a population of 100,000 should normally be required for promotion to county borough status.    The result, if this is approved by Parliament,will be that there will continue to be some county districts of substantialsize.    The Government believe that it would be right that the largerborough and urban district councils - those with a population exceeding60,000 - should be entrusted with the main responsibility for almost all the services listed in paragraph 3.    There are at present 55 suchauthorities.    They also believe that some of the other district councils can and should participate in responsibility for certain of these services (as indeed many already do);  but some of the services do need,for convenient and efficient management, to be based on a large population, and in relation to these other districts each service has tobe considered separately.9. A difficult question is whether, for any of the services,responsibility should be conferred outright on any of the district councils, or whether in all cases it should be delegated to them by the
county councils, the latter authorities retaining an overallresponsibility.    The original agreement among the representativesof the local authority associations proposed conferment of certainfunctions, delegation of others;  but on further consideration theCounty Councils Association have subsequently expressed the view thatdelegation would generally be the appropriate method.10. For some of the services in question - notably education,highways, and town and country planning - it is necessary that thecounty council should retain responsibility for the broad policy and,in relation to education and highways, for finance.    Therefore forthese services a system of delegation is inescapable.    It is the system which applies at present;  and the Government believe that it workssatisfactorily where the district councils are given a large measure of independence and where they are themselves of a size and character toexercise the responsibilities effectively.    Delegation is not a satisfactorysystem if the major authority retains a detailed control.    Certain ofthe existing delegation arrangements, however, provide no such control;and where it is considered right in principle that the minor authority should operate a particular service, it should be possible to give thema proper independence under a delegation system.    As a system,delegation has the advantage of flexibility.    The district councils whichare to participate in responsibility for the different services can besettled, county by county, by reference to the particular circumstances in each county, and adjusted from time to time as may be necessary,11, The Governments conclusion is that the delegation method,essential for some services, is the more appropriate generally.They are of opinion, however, that the larger borough and urban district councils should have an unquestioned right to exercise thepowers which are subject to delegation.    Only in relation to the smallerdistricts is there need to consider which of them can properly exerciseparticular functions by delegation.12. Accordingly the Government propose that borough and urban district councils with a population of 60,000 of more should be empoweredto claim all the responsibilities (with certain minor exceptions   ) listed in paragraph 3;  and that where they do so they should be entitled toexercise the powers independently of the county councils, subject onlyto the approval by the county council of the broad planning of the service or of the financial estimates, as the circumstances of the particular service may require.13. Outside the larger districts, the county councils must, inthe Government^ opinion, retain their responsibility for the followingservices:-   the domiciliary health and welfare services (which mustbe kept together as a group), education, employment of children,weights and measures, fertilizers and feeding stuffs, diseases of animals (including the licensing of waste food boiling plant) and, in planning, the right to prepare the town map.    It would be unreasonablehowever to make 60,000 a hard and fast dividing line, and provision should be made for delegation of these functions to districts with af        See paragraphs 19, 20, 24, and reservations to local health and welfare services in Appendix.
population below 60,000 on the same terms as to the larger districts -where, for example, a district has a population not far short of that figure, and is a self-contained town at some distance from other towns.Accordingly, the Government propose that the appropriate minister should be empowered to provide in special circumstances fordelegation of the functions listed in this paragraph to districts with a population less than 60,000,14. The other functions   - viz, , classified roads (and bridges)town and country planning (other than town maps)e   theatres and cinemas,food and drugs, milk and dairies - could, the Government consider,properly be delegated to a larger range of district councils, the extent and terms of delegation varying according to the requirements of theservice.    Thus a borough or urban district council should not undertake the responsibilities for classified roads and for the bridges thereon(which it is now proposed to bring together) unless it can employ the highly qualified staff and the expensive equipment essential for modernefficient highway administration.    At the other end of the scale,applications for permission to develop under Part III of the Town and country Planning Act can be handled by most district councils, givenco-operation with the county council and reference to them of difficultor major cases.   The Government propose that county councils shoulddelegate functions within this group to appropriate districts, with aright of appeal to the Minister concerned in case of dispute.15. For some, and maybe all, of the delegation arrangementsit will be appropriate that the county councils should make schemesshowing the powers delegated and the extent of control to be retained by the county council.    These schemes would be subject to theapproval of the appropriate Minister, who would consider the views expressed by all the authorities concerned before reaching a decision.In every case, the delegation should be as clear and unfettered aspossible;  and Departments will, in consultation with the local authority associations, prepare model schemes of delegation with a view toencouraging, so far as fits the circumstances, uniformity in the arrange-ments.16. R.ural districts present a distinctive problem.    It seems tothe Government that in the rural districts the county councils oughtto retain responsibility for classified roads, in view of the cost of this service and of its technical requirements;   and also responsibility forweights and measures,17. Further, the Government do not propose automatic delegation to rural district councils with a population of 60,000 or more, (of whichthere now are five) of all of the functions which it is proposed so to dele-gate to the larger boroughs and urban district councils.    For somepurposes a rural district, however large, does not as a rule form asconvenient an administrative unit as a borough or an urban district,since it is more apt to be dependent on a neighbouring town.    Thefunctions which would not be automatically delegated to the rural districts of 60,000 or more are health, welfare, education, employmentof children, town maps, food and drugs, milk and dairies.    Claims fordelegation of these functions would however be considered, and might in exceptional cases be granted.18. Apart from these reservations, rural districts wouldbe on just the same footing as other districts.
19. The powers of local authorities under the Shops Act shouldbe exercisable directly by all district councils irrespective of size,though it should be open to a district council to renounce the power infavour of the county council if it wished to do so.     Provision for this in respect of certain of the powers in question is made in the Shops bill now before Parliament.20. Functions relating to smallholdings should, in the Governmentsopinion, be retained by the county councils;  and it is proposed,therefore, to make no changes in the present arrangements.21. In the education service it is proposed that the divisionalexecutives should be abolished, and that outside the larger districtsthe county councils should exercise undivided responsibility.22. The new arrangements outlined in this Paper wouldsupersede those now existing.    Although some of the smaller district councils will lose certain functions they now exercise, the overall effect will be a more rational distribution of functions between one localauthority and another, with a consequent benefit to local government asa whole;  and that is the object which the Government are seeking.23. The application of these general proposals to particularfunctions is shown in the Appendix.24. These proposals do not apply to libraries.    The exerciseof this local government function needs to be considered in the context of the library service as a whole.    The Minister of Education proposesto set up a Committee to consider this question.    The redistribution of library functions will be considered in the light of the Committeefsreport.Greater London25. None of the proposals in the main White Paper applied to the structure of local government within the county of London.    It was said there (paragraph 45) that the administrative county of London has a systemof local government different from any other, and that any changes in its organisation would therefore have to be specially considered.     until this has been done, the time is not ripe to reach any decisions onredistribution of functions between the London County Council and theMetropolitan Borough Councils, apart perhaps from certain comparatively minor changes which have already been under discussion between theauthorities concerned.26. Middlesex presents its own difficulties.    It was proposed inthe main White Paper (paragraph 46) that the two-tier structure shouldbe retained throughout Middlesex, and that no promotions to countyborough status should be made.    Clearly the larger Middlesex district councils, some of which are very large indeed, should be entitled toexercise the responsibilities which it is envisaged should normally beexercised, in the rest of the country, by borough and urban district councils with a population of 60,000 or above (though in relation to oneor two of the less important of these functions it may be agreed thatin the particular circumstances of Middlesex the county council is themore appropriate unit).    The difficulty is that there are a fewMiddlesex districts which are comparatively small, and that this results in an unusual administrative pattern, the larger districts covering
the greater part of the county.    The representatives of the localauthority associations assumed (paragraph 14 of the Appendix to themain White Paper) that while there should be some redistribution ofpowers between the county council and the district councils, it wouldnot take place until after any necessary boundary adjustments oramalgamations.    As these problems are peculiar to Middlesex, theGovernment propose to hold separate discussions with the localauthority associations about the distribution of functions in the county.
