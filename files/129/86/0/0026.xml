secret(57) 76COPY NO.Si21st March, 1957CABINETMALTA:  ECONOMIC EQUIVALENCEMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the colonies as my colleagues know, one of the cardinal features of theproposals made by Mintoff for the integration of Malta with the UnitedKingdom is the attainment of &quot;economic equivalence&quot;.   During thediscussions held with him in February it became clear that by&quot;economic equivalence11 he means the achievement of &quot;parity&quot; in wages,social services and subsidies.   He proposes that the necessary increases in United Kingdom financial assistance should be proportionate to the increases in the rates of taxation in Malta so that, when those rates areequivalent to the rates of taxation in the United Kingdom, the wages ofall Government Servants (including employees of the Service Departments),the social services and subsidies in Malta will be equivalent to those inthe United Kingdom itself, i. e. after taking into account differences inclimate, rents, fuel costs, fares, etc.   At one point in the negotiationshe contemplated that this process should take twelve years with amaximum narrowing of the gap in any one year of 8 per cent but in his last offer he abandoned this timetable and proposed instead negotiationsevery two years.2.       It is not easy to cost his proposals, but when fully implementedthey might well amount to United Kingdom financial assistance of theorder of  20 millions- 30 millions a year on a conservative estimateof the increase in the United Kingdom standard of living.   At themaximum, this would amount at present prices to an annual grant ofabout  100 per head of population!  This of course is quite unthinkable.It would, among other consequences, make it impossible to encourage the development of manufacturing industries in Malta, make ituneconomic to maintain the Admiralty dockyard at its present level andimpossible for the people of the Islands, even if they themselves wished,to work productively for their living.   It would also destroy any incentive to emigration.   I am convinced that there can be no hope of a solution ofthe Island&apos;s difficulties on these subsidy lines quite unrelated to the island&apos;s productivity.3.       We have proposed to Mintoff the following financial arrangements -(i)   In respect of a capital programme to increase productivity and to cover a period of four or five years, Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould contribute  x, of which not more than  y should be issued in anyone year.   We are not yet able to propose a firm figure in respect ofthe capital programme, but we would not expect the programme to costmore than  5 millions a year.1-
(ii)  For the same four or five years, Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould contribute x per cent of the actual annual recurrent cost of the health, education and agreed social welfare services of the maltese government, with a minimum payment in each year of  y on the condition that the Maltese Government would bear the remainder of the recurrentbudget.   In discussion with Mintoff no figures were mentioned but hisofficials were told that we were likely to propose a 25 per cent contributionwith a minimum payment in each year of  900,000.In addition, we have offered to apply the same principles ofassistance to subsequent four or five year periods and have recognisedthat a review of the arrangements might be necessary if any drasticchange in Imperial defence policy resulted in the level of unemployment in malta remaining for six months at a higher rate than in this country at thetime.4.       These proposals are very fair and give to the Maltese Governmentassurances of United Kingdom financial assistance of a kind which isgiven to no other Government and which in my view are fully in accord with the peculiar constitutional status of the Islands under Mintoffsproposals for integration with the United Kingdom.5.       I therefore propose that he should be informed on his return toLondon that Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have given further consideration to the proposals he made in February; that they areunable to accept them; and that they stand by the formula at Appendix Awhich has already been approved by my colleagues (C.F.C.(57) 4th Meeting)to which they are ready to give practical expression as outlined inparagraph 3 above.   However, he may propose some small increase in our total contribution to the social services and in our minimum guaranteedannual figure; or he may suggest variations in the percentage between onesocial service and another with the same effect.   I hope my colleagues will agree that I can accept any minor changes of this kind and any minor amendments of the agreed formula such as indicated in the footnotes inAppendix A should it prove absolutely necessary to do so.6.       I seek the approval of my colleagues for this course and (I think Ican count on this1.) for our continued refusal to consider paying what wouldcertainly be a huge but unknown annual cheque towards wages, subsidies and social services, which, in turn, would ultimately lead to the Island&apos;smoral and physical ruin.7.       This may mean a complete break with Mintoff, with all that maymean in the way of strife and trouble in Malta.A. L.-E.Colonial Office, S.W.I.21st March, 1957
Her Majesty^ Government approve and support the ultimate aim of the Maltese Government, namely that the Islands should reach an economy and a standard of living comparable to that of the UnitedKingdom.The two Governments agree that this aim will take a long timeto achieve and that in the interim period special measures are needed to improve the productivity of the Islands and generally to help the maltese people forward especially on such matters as education andother social benefits.   This is in accord with the paragraphs of the       /Report of the Round Table Conference relating to United Kingdom aid.It will be open to the Maltese Government at any time afterfifteen years   to request that their economy become an integral part ofthat of the United Kingdom when direct and indirect taxation, rates and social contributions would be levied on the United Kingdom pattern.Both Governments agree that any such change would only be appropriate if and when the productivity drive has succeeded and the   jlevel of the two economies has been brought onto a comparable basis.In the light of all the foregoing, the financial arrangements listed belowhave been agreed by the two Governments./ The Maltese Government proposed deletion of this sentence as beingredundant and possibly misleading. This criticism seemed justifiedand it was dropped in further negotiations.* The Maltese Government have put forward a counter-proposal thatthe period should be twelve years. The United Kingdom&apos;s position on this point was reserved./     The Maltese Government proposed the following alternative wording -&quot;when the productivity drive has succeeded in bringing the economy of Malta to a level which, within the limitations of its available resources, is comparable to the United Kingdom. &quot;It was indicated to them that this might be acceptable if accompaniedby a clause emphasising that the Maltese people must make theutmost effort.PROPOSALS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCETO MALTA, CONSEQUENT UPON THE NEWC ONST IT UTIONAL ARRANGEMENT S
