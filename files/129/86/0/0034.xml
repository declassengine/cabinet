Defence: Outline of Future PolicyiThe defence policy of the United Kingdom is determined, as previousStatements on Defence have emphasised, by the need to fulfil our obligations as a member of the Commonwealth and of various regional defensive alliances.It must therefore enable us both to make our fair contribution to the Allieddeterrent to global war and to discharge our responsibilities in many parts ofthe world. But if that contribution is to be fully effective it must reflect the impact on strategic thought of the rapid progress in scientific and technological development.2. At the time of the Korean war in 1950 we launched a rearmament programme which was intended to build up our military strength, in conjunc-tion with our allies in NATO, to face what then appeared to be the imminentrisk of world war. Thereafter, the immediate danger of major war gave place to the prospect of a prolonged period of acute international tension. it became clear that the conception of the &quot; long haul &quot; must be substituted fora short intensive period of rearmament. To-day the Communist threatremains: but its nature has changed and it is now evident that, on both militaryand economic grounds, it is necessary to make a fresh appreciation of defence policy and to adopt a new approach towards it.Scientific Advances3. In recent years military technology has been making dramatic strides.New and ever more formidable weapons have been succeeding one another atan increasing rate. In little more than a decade the atom bomb dropped atHiroshima has been superseded by the far more powerful hydrogen ormegaton bomb. Parallel with this, the evolution of rocket weapons of allkinds, both offensive and defensive, has been proceeding apace.4. It has been clear for some time that these scientific advances mustfundamentally alter the whole basis of military planning. But, it is onlynow that the future picture is becoming sufficiently clear to enable a comprehensive reshaping of policy to be undertaken with any degree ofconfidence.Demands on Economic Resources5. Britain&apos;s influence in the world depends first and foremost on the health of her internal economy and the success of her export trade. without these, military power cannot in the long run be supported nor can Communisteconomic infiltration into the under-developed areas of the world be effectivelycountered. It is therefore in the true interests of defence that the claims ofmilitary expenditure should be weighed against the need for maintaining thecountry&apos;s financial and economic strength.6. Over the last five years defence has taken 10 per cent, of Britain&apos;sgross national income. Some 7 per cent, of the working population are either in the Services or supporting them. One-eighth of the metal-using industries, upon which the export trade so largely depends, are engaged on defence production.   About two-thirds of this country&apos;s expenditure on
research and development, and a large proportion of its highly qualifiedscientists and engineers engaged on this work, are employed on defenceprojects. In addition, the retention of such large forces abroad gives riseto heavy charges which place a severe strain upon the balance of payments.Britain&apos;s Responsibilities7. A defence plan, if it is to be effective and economical, must be basedon a clear understanding of the military responsibilities to be discharged.Britain&apos;s armed forces must be capable of performing two main tasks:  (i) to play their part with the forces of Allied countries in deterring andresisting aggression;(ii) to defend British colonies and protected territories against localattack, and to undertake limited operations in overseas emergencies.The aim must be to provide well-equipped forces sufficient to carry out these duties, while making no greater demands than are absolutely necessary uponmanpower, money and other national resources.8. Frequent changes in defence policy are wasteful and disturbing.Experience has shown that the rapid progress of scientific development andconstant fluctuations in the international situation make it difficult to foreseefuture military requirements with any certainty, and that, consequently, agood deal of flexibility must be maintained. Nevertheless, an attempt mustbe made to establish a broad framework within which long-term planningcan proceed.Collective Defence9. The growth in the power of weapons of mass destruction has emphasised the fact that no country can any longer protect itself in isolation.The defence of Britain is possible only as part of the collective defence of thefree world. This conception of collective defence is the basis of the north atlantic, South-East Asia and Baghdad alliances.10. The trend is towards the creation of integrated allied forces. There-fore, provided each member nation plays its fair part in the joint effort, itis not necessarily desirable that each should seek to contribute national forces which are by themselves self-sufficient and balanced in all respects. but whatever yardstick is taken, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that britain has been bearing a disproportionately large share of the total burdenof Western defence. Moreover, in assessing the value of her military effort,it must be remembered that, apart from the United States, Britain alone makes a contribution to the nuclear deterrent power upon which the peace of theworld so largely rests.Nuclear Deterrent11. It must be frankly recognised that there is at present no means ofproviding adequate protection for the whole country against the consequences of an attack with nuclear weapons. Though, in the event of war, the Huntersand Javelins of the Royal Air Force would unquestionably be able to take a heavy toll of any enemy bombers, a proportion would inevitably get through.Even if it were only a dozen, they could with hydrogen bombs inflict wide-spread devastation.12. This makes it more than ever clear that the overriding consideration in all military planning must be to prevent war rather than to prepare for it.
13. While comprehensive disarmament remains the foremdst objective of British foreign policy, it is unhappily true that, pending international agreement, the only existing safeguard against nuclear aggression is thepower to threaten retaliation in kind.14. The free world is to-day mainly dependent for its protection uponthe nuclear capacity of the United States. While Britain cannot by comparisonmake more than a modest contribution, there is a wide measure of agreement that she must possess an appreciable element of nuclear deterrent power ofher own. British atomic bombs are already in steady production and theRoyal Air Force holds a substantial number of them. British megatonweapons are now being developed and a stock of them will in due course be manufactured.15. The means of delivering these weapons is provided at present by medium bombers of the V-class, whose performance in speed and altitude isequal to that of any bomber aircraft now in service in any other country. It isthe intention that these should in due course be supplemented or replaced by medium-range ballistic rockets. A provisional agreement for the supply ofthese missiles has been entered into with the United States.Defence of the Deterrent16. Since peace so largely depends upon the deterrent fear of nuclearretaliation, it is essential that a would-be aggressor should not be allowed tothink he could readily knock out the bomber bases in Britain before their aircraft could take off from them. The defence of the bomber airfields orrocket launching sites is therefore an essential part of the deterrent and is, webelieve, a feasible task. A manned fighter force for this purpose will bemaintained and will progressively be equipped with air-to-air guided missiles.These fighter aircraft will in due course be replaced by a ground-to-air guidedmissile system.17. The possibility is not being overlooked that scientific progress may eventually make it possible to devise a means of defence even againstbombardment by ballistic rockets. Research on this problem, in collaboration with the United States, is being intensified.Civil Defence18. While concentrating available resources as far as possible on building up an active deterrent power, it would be wrong not to take some precautionsto minimise damage, should the deterrent fail to prevent war. Civil Defencemust accordingly retain a place in the defence plan.19. As in other fields, the country&apos;s economic capacity limits the effort which can be devoted to this purpose. In 1957-58 it will be necessaryto concentrate on keeping the existing local organisation in being so as toprovide a basis on which realistic planning can continue. The necessarytraining equipment will be provided. Essential research will proceed; and work on providing emergency communications and on setting up the fall-outwarning and monitoring system will go on. These preparations will providea basis for expansion, should that later be necessary.Europe and Atlantic20. The possession of nuclear air power is not by itself a completedeterrent. The frontiers of the free world, particularly in ^Europe, must be firmly defended on the ground. For only in this way can it be made clearthat aggression will be resisted.
21. Britain must provide her fair share of the armed forces needed for thispurpose. However, she cannot any longer continue to make a dis-proportionately large contribution. As the figures below show, the defence expenditure of this country has been higher, in relation to national income,than that of any other member of NATO, except the United States.Defence Expenditure(The figures below are based on NATO definitions of defence expenditure)	Per Cent, of		National	Spent in 1955	Income	(  million)United States   ......	11-2	14.460United Kingdom	9-3	1.569France   ...	7-8	1.118Canada ...	7-7	648Netherlands	6-5	159Greece   ...	6-4	44Turkey.........	5-7	135Germany......	5-3	625Italy      .........	4-7	324Portugal...	4-7	28Norway ...	4-3	48Belgium ...	4 0	121Denmark.........	3-6	47Luxembourg	3-6	422. In these circumstances, Her Majesty&apos;s Government, after dueconsultation with the Allied Governments in the North Atlantic Council andin the Council of the Western European Union, have felt it necessary to makereductions in the British land and air forces on the Continent. The strengthof the British Army of the Rhine will be reduced from about 77,000 to about64,000 during the next twelve months; and, subject to consultation with theAllied Governments in the autumn, further reductions will be made thereafter.The organisation of this force will be streamlined in such a way as to increasethe proportion of fighting units and atomic rocket artillery will be intro-duced which will greatly augment their fire-power.23. The aircraft of the Second Tactical Air Force in Germany will bereduced to about half their present number by the end of March, 1958. this reduction in numbers will be counter-balanced by the fact that some of the squadrons will be provided with atomic bombs. A similar reduction willbe made in the light bomber force in England, which is assigned to NATO.24. Naval forces do not for the most part contribute directly to the deterrent and their role in total war is uncertain. It may well be that the initial nuclear bombardment and counter-bombardment by aircraft or rocketswould be so crippling as to bring the war to an end within a few weeks oreven days, in which case naval operations would not play any significant part.On the other hand, there is the possibility that the nuclear battle might not prove immediately decisive; and in that event it would be of great importanceto keep open Atlantic communications against submarine attack. It istherefore necessary for NATO to maintain substantial naval forces andmaritime air units. Britain must make her contribution, though, for thereasons given above, it will have to be on a somewhat reduced scale.
Far East29. In South-East Asia, apart from defending her colonies and protectorates, Britain has agreed to assist in the external defence of Malayaafter she attains independence. Britain also has an international commitment,as a member of the SEATO and ANZAM defence systems, to help preservestability and resist the extension of Communist power in that area.30. It is proposed to maintain in this theatre a mixed British Gurkhaforce and certain air force elements, together with a substantial garrison in Hong Kong and a small naval force based on Singapore.31. In addition, there is a Commonwealth Strategic Reserve. this includes a brigade, to which Britain contributes two battalions. Australiaand New Zealand jointly provide the remainder of the brigade and somenaval and air forces.32. After consultation with the United States and with the other commonwealth countries concerned, the Government have decided to with-draw the remaining United Kingdom troops, approximately a battalion, fromKorea. A liaison mission will be retained at the Headquarters of the united nations Command.Overseas Garrisons33. Garrisons for British colonies and protectorates make substantialdemands upon military manpower. Some of these garrisons are at presentlarger than is necessary for internal security and yet are too small to provideeffective protection against serious aggression.34. Having regard to the fact that Colonial forces are increasinglyassuming responsibility for internal security and that it is now possible tosend reinforcements rapidly from Britain, the Government propose to reducegarrisons generally to the numbers immediately necessary for the defence against local attack where such a threat exists.25. Outside the area covered by the North Atlantic Alliance, Britain hasmilitary responsibilities in other parts of the world, in particular in the middle east and South-East Asia.26. Apart from its own importance, the Middle East guards the right flank of NATO and is the gateway to the African continent. In the ArabianPeninsula, Britain must at all times be ready to defend Aden Colony and protectorates and the territories on the Persian Gulf for whose defence sheis responsible. For this task, land, air and sea forces have to be maintained in that area and in East Africa.27. In addition, Britain has undertaken in the Baghdad Pact toco-operate with the other signatory States for security and defence. It isthe especial purpose of the Pact Powers to prevent Communist encroachmentand infiltration. In the event of emergency, British forces in the Middle Eastarea would be made available to support the Alliance. These would includebomber squadrons based in Cyprus capable of delivering nuclear weapons.28. As a result of the termination of the Treaty with Jordan, britain has been relieved of the responsibility for defending that country in the eventof attack; and British forces are being withdrawn. The British troops in libya will also be progressively reduced.
Sea Power38. On account of their mobility, the Royal Navy and the Royal Marinesprovide another effective means of bringing power, in particular air power,rapidly to bear in peace-time emergencies or limited hostilities. In modern conditions the role of the aircraft carrier, which is in effect a mobile airstation, becomes increasingly significant.39. With this consideration in mind, it is proposed to base the main elements of the Royal Navy upon a small number of carrier groups, eachcomposed of one aircraft carrier and a number of supporting ships. Apartfrom carriers, the number of large ships will be restricted to the minimum.The cruisers in the active fleet will be reduced and, in due course, replaced by new ships of the Tiger Class, now under construction. Similarly, in thevarious categories of smaller vessels, the policy will be to rely on a reducednumber of more modern ships, some of which will be equipped with guided missiles. A considerable number of ships now in reserve, includingbattleships, will be disposed of or scrapped.40. It is the Governmenfs intention to maintain British naval strengthEast of Suez at about its present level. One carrier group will normally be stationed in the Indian Ocean and a small force at Singapore.IIMan Power and Recruitment41. Part I of this paper has outlined the changes which must be made inour defence policy to adapt it to the rapid development of military science and technology and to enable the country not only to discharge its defence commitments but also to pursue sound and progressive economic policies.This Part seeks to make a corresponding assessment of the future manpowerneeds of the Services.42. In this country we have a long and honourable tradition of voluntarymilitary service. Regular professional forces have secured our defence inpeace and have formed the core of our expanded forces in war. Since the endof the last war voluntary recruitment has been supplemented by the continuance35. With the reduction in the size of garrisons and other British forces overseas, it is more than ever essential to be able to despatch reinforcementsat short notice. With this object, a Central Army Reserve has been created in the British Isles.36. To be effective, the Central Reserve must possess the means of rapidmobility. For this purpose, a substantial fleet of transport aircraft has been built up in R.A.F. Transport Command. This is at present mainly composedof Comet IFs, Beverley freighters and Hastings aircraft, to which a numberof Britannias will later be added. These transport resources of the R.A.F.would be supplemented, when necessary, by suitable civil aircraft and naval vessels.37. Besides the land forces of the Central Reserve additional millitary power for overseas emergencies can be rapidly provided from the resourcesof the Bomber, Fighter and Coastal Commands of the Royal Air Force.
of National Service. But it has been the declared aim of successive Govern-ments to bring this to an end and to return to our traditional methods as soonas this can be done consistently with our defence obligations throughout theworld. The present Government have frequently reaffirmed this aim and they believe it to accord with the general desire of the nation.43. The revised defence plan, with its greatly reduced demands on man-power and its emphasis on highly trained mobile forces, now makes it reason-able to contemplate putting the Armed Forces on to an all-regular footing.National Service inevitably involves an uneconomic use of manpower,especially in the training organisation. There are at present no less than150,000 men training or being trained in the establishments of the three services. This high figure is due, in large measure, to the continuous turn-overinseparable from National Service, the abolition of which would make possiblesubstantial economies in manpower. A corresponding economy could bemade in administrative overheads. The Service Departments and Ministry ofSupply are already engaged in a further effort to reduce these, in particular to cut down the numbers of headquarters and the size of staffs, to eliminateduplication on common tasks such as signal communications, and to reducethe number of men serving in depots and base installations by concentratingwork in fewer places. Every endeavour will also be made to extend thepractice of employing civilians or civilian contractors on tasks where it isnot essential, for military reasons, to employ Service personnel, such asstorekeeping, accounting, maintenance and equipment, policing and catering.44. In reorganising the Services on a more compact, efficient, and highly trained basis we shall, of course, take fully into account our commitments to our allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and our other regionalalliances. The process will need to be kept constantly under review in thelight of changing strategic circumstances, and will inevitably take aconsiderable time. At present the total strength of the Forces is about700,000.* By the end of 1957-58 the Forces will still comprise 620,000 men.Subsequent reductions will depend largely on our success in attracting asufficient number of regular recruits. On present indications it is possibleto envisage that by 1962 the Services should be stabilised at a total strengthrather more than half the existing figure.45. The Government have made a comprehensive review both of thedemands upon the economy and of our vital military commitments. Theyhave concluded that, in the light of the need to maintain a balanced distribu-tion of the national resources of manpower, regular forces on this scaleconstitute the objective which they should seek ultimately to attain. In then-view, if the three Services are reshaped and redistributed on the lines indicated above and commitments are re-assessed in the manner outlined in this paper,this country can discharge its own overseas responsibilities and make its faircontribution to the joint defence of the free world. The Government have accordingly decided to plan on this basis.46. On this basis the Government hope to avoid any further call-up under the National Service Acts after the end of 1960. Nevertheless, ifvoluntary recruiting fails to produce the numbers required, the country willhave to face the need for some limited form of compulsory service to bridge the gap. While regular recruitment is building up and the strength of theForces is being run down, it will be necessary to reduce progressively the* This figure relates to adult male uniformed United Kingdom personnel of all ranks and excludes Gurkhas, Colonial forces, women and boys.
size of the National Service intake. The number of men becoming availablefor National Service will to a growing extent exceed requirements. TheGovernment will announce as soon as possible the way in which they intend to effect the call-up of the numbers needed. Every effort will be made toensure thac this is done in as fair and reasonable a manner as possible. TheGovernment believe that, provided it is seen to be an inseparable part of theprocess of winding up National Service, the country will accept anyunavoidable anomalies with understanding.47. But this process will not be easy; nor is the problem the same inall three Services. The Royal Navy is already, in the main, a regular force on long-service engagements and it should readily attract enough recruitsto meet its needs. In the Royal Air Force, 127,000 other ranks, or about two-thirds of the present strength, are regulars. But some 31,000 of theseare serving on three-year engagements; and many of them would not haveenlisted but for their liability for National Service. Nevertheless, the recentimprovement in its recruiting makes it reasonable to hope that the R.A.F.will be able to enlist enough regulars to meet the smaller numbers required under the revised plan.48. It is in the Army that the greatest difficulty arises. Only about164.000 are regulars; and of these, less than 80,000 are serving on engage-ments of over three years. A marked improvement in regular recruiting will therefore be needed to make it independent of National Service.49. Moreover, it is not enough simply to reach the total strengthsrequired. A proper balance must be maintained in the composition of theforces. The replacement of the men who are now called up after defermentas apprentices will constitute a special problem. With the continuousdevelopment of modern equipment, skilled tradesmen are increasingly important. Unless, therefore, an adequate proportion of these can be recruited, the Services will be in danger of becoming unbalanced and losingin efficiency. There is also the problem of obtaining sufficient recruits toman the branches which perform the less popular duties.50. In order to encourage recruiting, the Government will seek to makelife in the Services more attractive. As already announced, the scales of rationsare being increased. It is also proposed to press ahead with the modernisation of barrack accommodation, the construction of more married quarters, andthe provision of better recreational facilities. Methods of improving theserviceman&apos;s prospect of good employment on his return to civilian life arebeing examined. In these and other ways plans are being prepared for thedifferent ranks and branches of each Service, with the object of offering goodlong-term careers.51. In order to waste no time in building up the Regular element, the recruiting campaign will be intensified, and more money will be provided in the coming year for this purpose.Reserve Forces52.   Reserve forces will continue to have an important part to play.53. Apart from the flying units of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force andthe Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve which it has regretfully been foundnecessary to disband, the Naval and Air Forces Reserves will be retained intheir present roles, though the numbers required will have to be reduced to accord with the new plan.
54. Reservists will continue to be needed to make good deficiencies inthe Regular Army in overseas emergencies. However, the great majority ofthe Reserve Army, in particular the Territorial Army and A.E.R., willcontinue to be trained and equipped primarily for Home Defence.55. Under present plans Britain is due to provide two Territorial Armydivisions as reinforcements for NATO. Since these certainly would not beready for action on the Continent in less than three months, which in nuclearwar would be of little value, the Government consider that it would be more appropriate to assign them to Home Defence duties like the rest of theTerritorial Army.   This question is being discussed with SACEUR.IllExpenditure56. The Defence Estimates for the year 1956/57 amounted to about 1,600 million, before deducting receipts from the United States and Germany.Had the programme as planned a year ago been allowed to continueunchanged, the figure for 1957/58 would have risen to about  1,700 million.57. However, as a result of strenuous efforts to effect economy, it hasbeen found possible to keep the defence estimates for the coming year down toa total of  1,489 million. From this must be deducted receipts from Germanyand the United States, which are expected to amount to about  50 million and 19 million respectively. Thus the net estimate of total defence expenditure for the year 1957/58 will amount to about  1,420 million. This large savinghas been secured by various measures, including in particular a substantial reduction in the overall strength of the forces, the cutting down of production orders and purchases of stores and some curtailment of the research anddevelopment programme.58. It is not yet possible to forecast the level of expenditure in later years. It should not however be expected that it will show a decline in anyway comparable with that in the manpower strengths of the forces. Thisis primarily due to the ever-increasing complication of modern weapons andequipment, the higher cost per man of regular forces and the fact thatproportionately more civilians will be employed. Nevertheless, it can safely be assumed that the new plan, when it is fully implemented, will furtherappreciably reduce the burden on the economy. Above all, it will releaseskilled men, including many badly needed scientists and technicians, for employment in civilian industry. Both exports and capital investment willgain.Research and Development
Commonwealth Co-operation60. With the advance of military technology. Commonwealth co-operation on research and development is assuming increasing importance. an outstanding example is the development of guided missiles at Woomera, whichis being undertaken jointly by the United Kingdom and Australia.61. The Government will seek to maintain and foster close co-operation in defence matters generally with members of the Commonwealth. This willcontinue to be effected by normal intergovernmental consultations, frequentmeetings of Chiefs of Staff, the exchange and secondment of officers, and thesupply of training facilities.Switch of Resources62. This new plan involves the biggest change in defence policy evermade in normal times. In carrying it through a certain amount of disturbanceis unavoidable.63. The large reduction in the size of the forces will inevitably createsome surplus of officers and N.C.Os. It will take a little time to assess the numbers precisely. The proportion will differ for each Service and forthe various ranks and branches. Those whose careers have to be prematurelyterminated will be given fair compensation and will be helped in every way possible to find suitable employment in civil life.64. Similarly, the volume of defence work of many kinds will be curtailed, and some establishments will have to be closed. The manpower and industrial resources released must be absorbed into productive use as quickly as possible. The Government Departments concerned will do all they can to secure that this switch is effected smoothly.IVConclusion65. The Government have adopted this new defence plan in theconfidence that it will not only give relief to the country&apos;s sorely strainedeconomy, but will produce compact all-regular forces of the highest quality.66. The three Services will be equipped and organised on the most up-to-date lines. The Fleet will be composed of modern vessels. The army will be equipped with atomic artillery and given a high degree of strategicmobility. The Air Force will be supplied with British megaton bombs; amissile system of air defence will be developed; and ballistic rockets willbe introduced to supplement the V-bombers.67. In short, it is the intention that, when reorganised in accordance withthe new plan, Britain&apos;s armed forces shall be better equipped, better trained and better designed for the tasks that lie ahead.
