(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY&quot; OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOvERNMEI\fT)COHflDEMIAL$Amiss.16th April, 1957CABINETSIIOPS bill memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and Lord Privy SealOn 15th April the Cabinet considered the proposed Governmentamendments to the Shops Bill (C.0,(57) 34th Conclusions, Minute 7).   Thethree main amendments Y/ere for -(a) removing the power of the local authority to fix earlier hoursthan the general closing hours in the Bill, and so to fixdifferent hours for different trades, etc.;(b) providing for late evening sales of confectionery and tobacco;and(c) enabling local authorities in holiday resorts to dispense withclosing hours during the season,2.     The Cabinet wore in general agreement with the first two of thesebut the Minister of Labour suggested that amendments such as the thirdmight be avoided, and that it might be preferable merely to give localauthorities in holiday resorts power to fix later closing hours during the season than the normal ones.3,     I have discussed this suggestion with the Minister of Labour andthe Minister of Education.   I find that it would give rise to draftingdifficulties and would further complicate an already complicated Bill.Moreover it would be liable to give rise to foolish anomalies.   For example local authority which really wanted to abolish the closing hoursaltogether during the season would be able to fix 11.39 p.m. as the closing hour, with the result that shops would have to close for one minute until they could re-open immediately after midnight.4.     In my view, therefore, there is no practical alternative to theproposal in my previous memorandum (i.e, paragraph 1(c) above).   There canbe no doubt that there is a genuine need for unrestricted shopping hours in holiday resorts during the limited season and the trs.de unions realisethis.    The shop assistants&apos; holidays remain unaffected.5.     I am arranging for the text of the amendments to be circulated assoon as they are printed.R.A.B.Home Office, S.W.1 .16th April, 1957/
