EUROPEAN CUSTOMS AND ECONOMIC union note by the Chairman of the Economic PolicyCommitteeThe Economic Policy Committee, at their meeting on 27th March,considered the attached report by officials on the association of overseaterritories with the European Customs and Economic Union and a european industrial free trade area (E.A.(57) 7th Meeting, Item l).2.      The Customs and Economic Union Treaty has just been signed by the Governments of France, Italy, Western Germany, Belgium, theNetherlands and Luxembourg.    It is likely to be ratified by Germany andFrance before September.    We must, therefore, proceed in the expectation that the Customs and Economic Union will become anaccomplished fact.    The Treaty provides for the association of theFrench and Belgian oversea territories with the Customs and economic union on the terms described in paragraph 2 of the attached report.3.      The situation which confronts us is, therefore, that which we have always anticipated, but with the additional serious complication of theassociation of oversea territories with the Customs Union.    When theTreaty comes into operation, the six countries will gradually establish a common tariff against imports from the rest of the world, broadlycalculated by averaging their present tariffs.    At the same time, theirtariffs against imports from French and Belgian oversea territories, andthe tariffs of the French oversea territories against goods from the restof the six countries, will be lowered on a discriminatory basis, with consequent damage to our exports and those of our Colonies.4.      The question to be answered remains whether we should seek to associate ourselves on acceptable terms with the Customs andEconomic Union, or to stand aside.5.     The courses open to us are described in paragraphs 20 to 36 ofthe attached report.    These are in brief -(a)    To continue to press forward with our existing policy -namely the speedy negotiation in the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) of an industrial free trade area, excluding all overseaterritories, whilst seeking adjustments in the arrange-ments of the Customs Union to mitigate the damage tothe interests of ourselves and our Colonies.secret.(57) 8130th March, 1957CABINET
(b) To examine the possibility of associating our african territories (including the Central African federation and Ghana) and the French and Belgian territories in africa with an O.E.E.C. free trade area.(c) To re-examine the possibility - which was earlierconsidered and rejected - of finding some suitable form of association of the United Kingdom and thewhole of the Commonwealth, both dependent and independent, with EURAFRICA, i.e. the associationof French and Belgian African territories with theCustoms and Economic Union.The Economic policy Committee accepted the view of officialsthat the first of these courses was much to be preferred.6.      It will be important through coming weeks and months to keep inclose touch with the Colonies and independent Commonwealth countries.A conference with Colonial representatives is now in progress.    Mean-while, it would be premature to make known our attitude to the associationof oversea territories with the Customs Union or the free trade area.7.      The Economic Policy Committee will keep the situation underreview and will report to the Cabinet as the necessity arises.P.T.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.29th March, 1957.
ASSOCIATION OF OVERSEAS TERRITORIES WITH THEEUROPEAN CUSTOMS AND ECONOMIC UNION AND THEEUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL FREE TRADE AREARe-port by the Economic Steering Committee1.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked for an appreciation of the present situation, both in respect of the UnitedKingdom7s own interests and those of the Colonies and independent.Commonwealth.     We had foreseen from the beginning that theassociation of Overseas Territories (O.Tfs) with the EuropeanCustoms and Economic Union would raise major issues of policy,and a note showing the steps we have taken in relation to the six, and the procedures now proposed for further consultation,is annexed.The Messina Treaty2.     The Six have completed their Treaty, for signature at Romeon 25th March.      The basis for association of the French and dutch overseas territories and the Belgian Congo (the Messina0,T&apos;s) is as follows:-(a) The tariffs of the Six against imports from Messina0.T.13 will be gradually removed:    the Six willmove forward gradually to a common tariff againstimports from elsewhere, calculated by averaging thepresent tariffs (for example, the duty on non-0.T.bananas, now 20 per cent in France, k-0 per cent in italy, 15 per cent in Benelux, and nil in Germany,would become, say, 20 per cent all round).     Therewill be no special &quot;managed market&quot; arrangementsfor tropical products, except insofar as there isan overlap with temperate products where such arrangements exist.(b) In -che French O.TTs, the tariff against goods fromthe rest of the Six will be reduced to the Frenchpreferential level:    the import quotas for goods from the rest of the Six will be progressivelyincreased.    .In the Belgian Congo there are nopreferences and no quotas.(c) The EURAFRICA investment fund will be created forthe benefit cf the French O.T&apos;s (the Belgian Congohas been contracted out:    there is just a littlefor the Dutch O.T&apos;s).3.     The investment and quota commitments are regarded asexperimental and are made for only five years.      The treaty will provide that the tariff arrangements should be permanent;but in practice all these matters will probably be re-examined in the review which is provided for at the end of five years.1+.     There are great complexities arising from the differingconstitutional status of the O.T&apos;s.     Algeria (and certain other territories, e.g. the French West Indies) are regardedas part of France, and thus part of the Customs Union.     TheBelgian Congo and French Congo Basin territories are not allowed preferential tariffs anyway.     It is hoped thatMorocco, Tunis, Surinam and Curacao will be associated withthe Customs Union.
Ill5.     The Six have not seriously considered the implications of their plans either for the free trade area or for theworld economy and trading arrangements.      They have beenpreoccupied with the task of getting agreement among themselves.6.      It is not yet certain how far the Treaty will be textuallyincompatible v/ith the obligations of the Six to ourselves andthe rest of the world in G-.A.T.T.     But in relation to UnitedKingdom and Colonial interests the crux will be the detailsof the tariff schedules in Europe and the administrative arrangements in the O.T&apos;s - these will disclose how far theintention is to build a preferential bloc in the restrictivesense.7.      The Six will no doubt present their Colonial proposals as a constructive liberation and development of the FrenchO.T&apos;s.     At present, 75 per cent of the O.T&apos;s imports andover 70 per cent of their exports are with France and other.TTs - 83 per cent of Algeria&apos;s trade, 78 per cent ofFrench West Africa&apos;s.      (For the United Kingdom Colonieswith less preference and with virtually complete liberalisationtowards imports from Europe, the corresponding proportion isabout kO per cent, for the Belgian Congo, about k5 per cent).Certainly the plan is a widening of the channels of tradeinto the O.Trs, plus investment which would not have happenedotherwise.     They would probably also assert willingness, on terms, to widen the association further to include UnitedKingdom and other European countries.      It cannot be presumed,in fact, that this will be open to attack as a plan tomonopolise and restrict trade.Problems for the United Kingdom8.     The difficulties which follow for the United Kingdom evre:-(a) The united Kingdom Colonies would have to face anincreased tariff in their Continental market, andpreference for the Messina. O.T&apos;s,(b) The same applies to other Commonwealth countries,to the extent that they compete with theMessina O.T&apos;s.(c) German, Benelux and Italian exporters will haveimproved access to the French O.T. market, andthe United Kingdom exporters will not.The extent of thepe difficulties will depend upon the intentions of France and the rest of the Six, and is notexplicit in the Treaty.S.      On (a), the position is that about one-eighth of theUnited Kingdom Colonies&apos; trade is with the Six.     A largeblock of this trade consists of raw materials, such asrubber, which are free of duty.      On some important tropicalfoods (e,.g. copra) it seems unlikely that there would be significant damage to the Colonies&apos; interests.      The most vulnerable products are likely to be East African coffeeand West African cocoa.      It is expected by the trade thatthe impact would be felt first in some weakening of prices;
and in the longer term the stimulation of production inthe French O.T&apos;s would be likely to intensify the competitionboth in price and in access to markets.      Colonial producers of bananas at present make virtually no sales in Continentalmarkets, but their interests would be damaged by the planbecause the prospective world surplus would be increased.There may be particular local problems in trades of emailtotal significance but of great importance to individualterritories.     We shall be getting the Colonies&apos; views onthese.     There will certainly be resentment in the colonies at having to face discrimination by European countries whenthey have liberalised their quota restrictions on importsfrom Europe so completely.10.    On (b), Ghana is vulnerable on cocoa;    apart from this it seems unlikely that there will be major damage to the big Commonwealth exporters, for in very few commodities arethe Messina O.T&apos;s large exporters on a world-wide scale.In any case, the independent Commonwealth, even if not directly affected, will feel that they are losing prospects of expanding markets in Europe.11*      On (c), the total United Kingdom exports to the FrenchO.T&apos;s are of the order of  20 millions a year, not a significant proportion of our total exports:,      There is,therefore, noc as much business at stake as might have been expected:    and in avry^case much of the benefit whichBenelux, Germany and Italy will derive will be at theexpense of France.     But we should be losing some opportunityof expansion.12.    Thus we would doubt that there would be great damage to united Kingdom and Commonwealth interests.      The total exportsof the French O.T&apos;s are about  500 millions, but over70 per cent of these go to France and other French O.T&apos;sanyway;    their total exports to the rest of the Six are only about  70 millions, cr about 2 per cent of these fivecountries&apos; total imports.      The British Colonies&apos; total exports are well over double those of the French O.T&apos;s, and theindependent sterling Commonwealth countries&apos; experts are over double again.     Moreover, special provision is already made in the Customs Union Treaty for mitigating the effectof the new common tariff on the exports of non-Messinaterritories, and furthor arrangements of the same kind maybe negotiable.13.     Y/e should be faced with a loss of competitive positionin one or two important Colonial trades and perhaps in sometrades which may be important for particular territories.Both we and the Colonial ana Commonwealth countries would lose opportunities of access to expanding markets.     But
these losses may be offset to the extent that the additionalinvestment in, and the accelerated development of, the FrenchO.T&apos;s led to increased incomes elsewhere and expanded world trade.     We may wish to modify the assessment of the damage in some of its details after consultation with commonwealth and Colonial Governments!     but this is not likely to affectthe magnitude of the problem.Europe and EURaFRICAIk-    The inclusion of the O.T&apos;s changes the shape of thecommon market project.      In trade terms, even includingMorocco and Tunis, the addition is only about 15 per cent,about equivalent to the total trade of, say, Italy.      Butin political terms,  the change is expressed in the newvocabulary - instead of &apos; &quot;mxucing Europe&quot;, they speak ofEURAFRICA.     What was a project of economic and politicalconsolidation of Western Europe, accepted as laudable and constructive by almost every section of world opinion, hasnow been associated with Arab and African nationalism andwith the issue of colonialism.15.    The world reaction to this transformation has not yet had time to appear, although Mr. Dulles has made encouragingstatements both to the French and the Germans.      If theattitude of the Arab-Asian bloc and Africans is adverse,there may be second thoughts in Europe and in U.S.A.lo.    In the meantime, we would recommend as a tacticalmeasure that Ministers continue to give public sup-port tothe European Customs and Economic Union project, but shouldcouple with such support a specific reservation of their position on the association of the O.Trs with it, both on political and on trade grounds.Alt e r na t iv e Objectives17*      The next few months will see heavy parliamentaryactivity in the capitals of the Six, as the Treaty movestowards ratification by France and Germanyj    there will beintensive negotiation in O.E.E.C. to frame the free tradeareai    there may be a session of G-..A.T. T. to examine the implications for the rest of the world.     The trading interests of the United Kingdom and the Colonies,, and alsothe independent Commonwealth, are sharply engaged,  and thepolitical impact of EURAFRICA will also be felt in theC com o west a 11 h18.      It follows that the most important task for Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment is to formulate the United Kingdom objectivethroughout this period..19.     We have assumed that Ministers would be unwilling totake as their objective the prevention of the association ofthe O.T&apos;s with the Buropean Customs and Economic Union.    Itmust be accepted, wo think, that this objective would implythe rejection of the whole Messina Treaty:    the Treatywithout the 0.T&apos;s would not pass the French Chamber in 1957*The collapse of this effort would be a weakening of Europe -and our activity in fostering it would not go unnoticed.
20.   The choice would thus lie between alternativeobjectives:-(a) Speedy negotiation of an O.E.E. C. industrial free trade Area (F.T.A.)  excluding all O.TTs togetherwith specific adjustment to mitigate damage to united Kingdom and United Kingdom Colonies&apos;interests.(b) A new plan to provide an association between UnitedKingdom, EUR AFRICA, other O.E.E.C.  countries, and united Kingdom Colonies (Plan H) , or UnitedKingdom African territories (Plan J)  or theCommonwealth (Plan K) .We think that these objectives should be kept absolutelydistinct from the point of view of the next&apos;six months butit would be possible if this were desired, to seek to developsome form of association as in (b)  after (a)  has been achieved.21.    Industrial F.T. Ao^excludinp; 0, T &apos;s.    To secure this objective, we shoiild continue full steam ahead with thenegotiations already beginning in O.E.E.C under theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s direction and initiative.   Weshould at the same time negotiate directly with the Six,individually and collectively, the detailed modifications intheir tariff schedules etc., for particular Colonial products(e,g. cocoa and coffee), and the administrative arrangements in Messina O.T. markets needed to minimise damage to our interests.22.    This would be the natural development of our policythroughout the last six months.   Technically, it should bewell within our power-.    As soon as the Treaty is available,we should at once pick out the particular points at which we need adjustments, confirm them at the Colonies&apos; meeting atthe end of this month, and later approach the Six.   This canbe done without undue difficulty simultaneously with theF. T.A. negotiations.23.    There would be five difficulties to over come:-(i)    Would the Six be prepared to exclude their, as wellas our, 0. T&apos; s from the F.T.A.?   If we made it anessential condition, possibly yes - but can weachieve both this and the exclusion of agriculture?(ii)    Would the Six also be prepared to make the specificadjustments in tariffs on tropical products etc.?(iii)    How should we publicly justify having O.T&apos;sassociated with the Customs Union but not withthe FoT.ii.?   This follows from the exclusion ofagriculture - an industrial F.T.A. is not a colonial matter at all.(iv)    What would bo our attitude to any requests fromindependent Commonwealth countries and from ourColonies that they should be allowed to join theF.T.A, with treatment on the same lines as theMessina O.T&apos;s - i.e. retaining their tariff withsharing of preference and possibly access to an investment fund?(v)    Would it be possible for us to secure in the G.A.T.T.the necessary waivers to compensate our Colonies,if we needed to do so, for the harmful effects ofthe Messina arrangements on their trade?
2iLu   It is clear that the negotiation of the industrialF. T.A. , already difficult, will now be more difficultbecause of those additional points to be gained.   On theother hand, the inclusion of&quot; the O.T&apos;s has imposed greatstresses on the cohesion of the Six, which may be further increased by anti-colonial reactions to EURAFRICA.25.   New Association Plans, H. J. K.   We have giver some consideration to possible plans for associating UnitedKingdom Colonies and other overseas territories with BUR AFRICA(and presumably, with the Scandinavian, Swiss, etc., too).26.   Plan H would restrict the association to the colonies and definitely exclude the independent Commonwealth.   Wegather that this is what M. Faure has in mind.   The logicalcourse on these premises would be for the United KingdomColonies and Messina O.T&apos;s to have equal treatment for their exports both in the United Kingdom mnrket and in the Six;for the United Kingdom in effect to be given the same treatment as Germany in the Messina O.T&apos;s, and for us to share preferences in the United Kingdom Colonies; ana possiblyfunds to be subscribed by us for the Messina O.T&apos;s and by the six for the United Kingdom Colon?es.   The Scandinavians andSwiss might receive analogous treatment.27.    There are three fundamental difficulties.   First, wecannot force our Colonies into such arrangements; they mustchoose.   Moreover, with us, the &quot;Colony&quot; is not a staticconcept.    If -Independent Commonwealth countries are to be excluded, this excludes not only Ghana but the central african Federation, Malaya and many more that will be independent before the scheme reaches full effect.    In this context, the idea of the &quot;United Kingdom Colonies&quot; isincoherent.   We should be creating a new division betweenthe Colonies which were eligible and chose to be in the plan,and the Colonies and other Commonwealth countries outside.It would impose an economic obstacle on Colonies&apos; movement towards independence.28.    Second, the arrangement implies the inclusion of foodstuffs in the P.T*A., because given the pressure toinclude agriculture throughout, it is hardly credible thatthis could be limited to a list of tropical foodstuffs - andof course even the inclusion of tropical foodstuffs wouldinvolve loss of preferences in the United Kingdom market bythe independent Commonwealth countries and by such colonies as chose to remain outside.29.   Third, the arrangement would mean that the United kingdom would lose Imperial Preference in those Colonies whichentered the schema; this is of only limited eoonomicimportance, since in many Colonies it is non-existent.30.    In Plan J, the attempt would be made to avoid the firstseries of difficulties above by confining the association toAfrican territories, including Ghana and the Central african federation, and pernaps even tenuously the Union.    If they all wished, to join, this might so alter the shape andpolitical content of EURAFRICA that something quite new would emerge.   But this has to be viewed as a political concept.Our own expectation would be that while there might be advantage to Africans in some coming together of african territories on their own initiative, it is most unlikely thata project inspired from Europe (as this would be) would command much political support.    In economic terms, thedifficulty about agriculture persists, and under this plan the effect of the loss of Imperial Preference would be substantial.
31e   Wo have not been able to formulate a Plan K -association of the whole of the Commonwealth - (or everybodywho wants to) v/ith EURAPRIGA.   This might imply a combinationaimed towards the following ultimate arrangements -(i)    an industrial P.T. A.  for O.E.E.C;(ii)    for a list of basic temperate agricultural products,a managed European market (including UnitedKingdom)  for European and Commonwealth supplies;(iii)    for a list of basic tropical agricultural products,a preferential market in Europe (including UnitedKingdom)  for Messina O.T&apos;s and the Commonwealth;(iv)    in the Messina O.T&apos;s and overseas Commonwealthsharing of preferences by all O.E.E.C. countries.32.   This sort of idea is, of course, much wider than anything implied at presents it would involve the breakdown of G.AoT.1. ,  the erosion and ultimate loss of imperial preference, and a completely new world trading structure,directed predominantly against U.S.A. , Latin America, japan and the unattached Asian countries.    It is unrealistic to envisage this as being acceptable to anything approaching the v/hole Commonwealth.    And even if such a grouping couldbe constituted, the economic division of the world which it represented might well carry damaging implications for the health of the Atlantic Alliance.33.   We included in the list of alternatives in 1956 theStrasbourg Plan - Plan P - which has some similarities to theabove.    It was then considered that Plan F would be tooexpensive for the United Kingdom.    Indeed, in the schemeabove, we should probably have more to lose from the managedmarket in basic foodstuffs and from the loss of preferencevis-a-vis European producers in the Commonwealth markets than we should gain from the lower tariff barriers in Exirope andin the Messina O.T&apos;s.3U.    If it were decided to adopt an objective like those of plans H, z and K above, a great deal of work would berequired, and consultation ?/ith the Commonwealths    It wouldprobably take three months&apos; intensive effort to draw up andappraise a plan to these specifications, and even if a suitableplan could be devised, the whole process of negotiation wouldhave to begin from scratch.    By the time this plan bad beenprepared and negotiated, the opportunity for making a constructive move in the consolidation of the West might havebeen lost.   Moreover the negotiations to implement a planthat involved all O.E.E.C.  and all the independent membersof the Commonwealth would have no chance of success.    If we wanted something like Plan K, the only practical coursewould be to create the industrial F0T.A.  first and graftother associations on to ito35,   We could not say in advance whether it would be practicable to draw a plan which was likely to bo acceptable to sufficient Commonwealth countries, tolerable to U.S.A*,negotiable with Europe,  and consistent with United kingdom interests.    The narrowest of such plans is at once directlyinconsistent oither with the project of the O.E.E.C.industrial F.T.A.  or v/ith our present relationships with theCommonwealth, and as the plans widen they become increasinglyinconsistent with the whole post-war structure of inter-national trading relationships upon which our access to overseas markets depends0
36.    If Ministers decided that it would be desirable toexamine plans of this general nature, with the objective ofan association of all or part of the Commonwealth withEURAFRICA, we consider that it would be necessary to slowdown the F.T.A. negotiations in 0.E, E.C. in order to permitenough effort to be put behind this new work, and in orderto prevent ourselves from being drawn into corrmitments inO.E.E.C. which might well be inconsistent with our ultimatepolicy.     But this would be a most dangerous course;    if thepresent momentum is lost, we may lose everything.A Possible Course of Action37c--   We have no. hesitation in recommending that we continueto concentrate on the first objective in paragraph 20 above -speedy  negotiation of an O.E.E.C. industrial free trade areaexcluding all O.T&apos;s,      together with specific adjustments to mitigate damage to the United Kingdom and United KingdomColonies&apos; interests cau^d by the inclusion of the MessinaO.T&apos;s   in the Customs Union Treaty.     This would not precludearrangements ceing made later, afcer the Free Trade Area hadbeen negotiated, to associato all or part of the Commonwealthwith it, and nothing should be said to slam the door to such development.     But equally nothing should be said to indicatethat we are even contemplating such a development0     If itwere, this would weaken our negotiating position in O.E.E.C.&quot;on the agricultural question and would prejudice our-ability to oppose the Colonial clauses of the Customs Union treaty in the G.A.T.T. , should we decide in the end that that is thecourse that would best suit us.38.    It would be impossible both to carry out the F.T.A.negotiation effectively and to examine and prepare new planssuch as H9J   and Ko       The issues involved in such plans are highly complex,  and their outcome unpredictable.      To proceedwith them now would put h ack into the melting pot the concept of the industrial free trade area and would reopen the tacitlyagreed terms on which we have secured the assent of theCommonwealth to the project of closer integration with Europe.39.   We recommend also (as in paragraph 16 above)  that ministers should wait   as long&apos;as possible, jay two months,before expressing a view about the&quot; association of the MessinaO.T 1 s    with the European Customs and Economic- Union, and aboutpossibilities of association of all or parts of theCommonwealth with the free trade area.     There   may well behostile reactions to EURAFRICA, from the Commonwealth, fromthe Arab-Asian bloc, and from Latin America - from some on political grounds and from others because of damage to their economic interests.     This may of course be expressed when thematter comes before the Ge A. T.T.      If so, the treatment by theQ-.A.T.T.  of this part of the Customs Union proposals will beaffected.     These&apos;world reactions may in turn engender doubtswithin the Six and suggestions of amendment or postponement of the terms of the 0.T&apos;s association.hOo    An early statement of British Government policy, publiclyor privately to the Six, might lead to a premature aonsoli-dation of opinion.     We have an entirely sound case forcomoletely reserving our position on the association of overseas territories - the Six have gone ahead with thispart of their project, against our advice, and we must nowwork out the implications with the Commonwealth before deciding what to do.
41.    Meanwhile we shall be consulting Colonial Governmentsat a meeting with Colonial representatives beginning on27th March, and shall be continuing the normal process of consultation with the independent Commonwealth.      In the lightof the reactions of Commonwealth and Colonial Governments,and of any indications we receive *jf the attitude of other european countries, we shall continue to keep under review the alternative possibilities sketched in this paper.Re c ommeiid at i on42.    We recommend that Ministers should endorse the policy set out in paragraphs 37-41 above.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.22nd March,  1957-
ANNEXMEASURES TAKEN BY THE UNITED KINGDOM TO SECUREDISCUSSION WITH THE MESSINA COUNTRIES OR THEPROBLEM OR OVERSEAS TERRITORIES1.     When the former Chancellor of the Exchequer sent a messaget*j the Einance Ministers of the Messina countries, immediatelyafter the House of Commons Debate on 26th November, 1956,drawing their attention to the Government!s willingness to entera European Eree Trade Area on suitable terms, he emphasised thatthe association of overseas territories with the EuropeanCustoms and Economic Union (which we understood was then being discussed by the Six) would create serious problems for theUnited Kingdom.     He suggested therefore that discussions shouldbe arranged at an early date between cfficials of the Six andthe United Kingdom officials on this subject.2.      This message was followed up by a number of attempts onour part to fix a date for a meeting with officials of the Six.The proposed meeting however was successively postponed on anumber of occasions by the Messina countries on the grounds that they were not yet ready to discuss the question.      Whenthe present Chancellor met M. Spaak on 15th January,  1957?M. Spaak said that it was impossible to arrange these discuss -snsuntil the Six were agreed among themselves about the provisions for associating overseas territories - and they had not yet reached such agreement.3.      We continued to press for a meeting, which was finallyarranged in Paris immediately after the O.E.E.C. ministerial council.      At this meeting, which took place on 15th February,we explained our difficulties but got very little response from the Six.     However, at a later meeting arranged in Brusselson 5th March we obtained a reasonably full exposition of their intentions.k.      We had always hoped thai&apos; the Six would not commit them-selves to specific proposals on the association of overseas territories until there had been full discussions with us.This was made clear in Mr. Macmillan&apos;s message to the finance ministers       the end of October and was emphasised again bythe present Chancellor to M. Spaak,      In spite of these representations - presumably because of political pressure bythe French - the Six have in fact committed thecisjl-*&apos;&apos;;s to a specific proposition which presents us with very great difficulty.5.      The Prime Minister, at his recent meeting with M. Mollet,pointed out that our difficulties had been greatly increasedoy the failure on the part of the Six to consult us fully before they were committed to a line of action.     M. Mollet suggestedthat consultation should now take place between British andFrench officials about the overseas territories and wo have accepted this offer.     We shall propose that these discussions should take place in the Anglo-French Economic Committee.6.      We arc alsg planning to hold further discussions with officials of the Messina countries collectively.      It is unlikely that there will &quot;be an opportunity for these discussionsbefore the Customs Union Treaty is signed on 25th March,      we hope before then to start bilateral talks in the Anglo-FrenchEconomic Committee.
7.     A conference with representatives of Colonial governments is to take place in London from 27th March to 2nd April inorder that the proposals of the Six may be discussed with themand their views obtained on the line to be followed by theUnited Kingdom.
