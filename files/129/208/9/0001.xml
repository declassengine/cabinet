SECRETMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 9 COPY NC 8329 January 1980CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITUREMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theChief Secretary, TreasuryL        In the light of our discussion on 24 January (CC(80) 3rd Conclusions,Minute 7), we have held further meetings with the Ministers concerned. Theoutcome of those discussions and our recommendations are described in thefollowing paragraphs.    The revised list of proposed reductions on theprogrammes we agreed in the autumn is at Annex A.SOCIAL SECURITY2. Further discussion with the Secretary of State for Social Services hasled to revised proposals being agreed as set out in Annex C.    These agreedsavings are not, however, sufficient from this very large programme and wemust seek more.3. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, and I accept that we cannot secureany savings from less than full-price protection of retirement pensions - thebulk of the programme.4. The Secretary of State for Social Services proposes to give a  1 perweek increase in child benefit (from  4 to  5) next November.    The ChiefSecretary, Treasury, and I are not able to agree to this;  we need a furthersaving totalling at least  200 million per annum from this programme for1981-82 and later years.    Annex C shows two ways of achieving this. Thefirst, which we prefer, is our earlier proposal that child benefit should beincreased by 5Op with a new premium of  1 given for the fourth and laterchildren, and that in the interests of work incentives supplementary benefitchildren&apos;s scale rates should be held back so as not to narrow the differentialbetween in-work and out-of-work income.    The second would be to give a 75pincrease in child benefit, with no premium, and with this to suspend theChristmas bonus and freeze the earnings rule for pensioners.    The savingsfrom these alternatives, compared with the Secretary of State for SocialServices&apos; proposal, would be:1SECRET

The Secretary of State for the Environment has agreed to the followingreductions:1980-81    1981-82    1982-83 1983-84270 489 605 695He wants to be free to settle the composition of his programme for the threelater years nearer the time.    For illustration, one combination of measuresto achieve his proposals might involve rent increases of 60p a week nextOctober and  2. 50 a we k each year from 1981-82; and council housebuildingapprovals of 35, 000 in 1980 and 30, 000 a year thereafter.    We would notpropose going further on rents, but in view of the severe difficulties on otherprogrammes we suggest further cuts on capital, as follows:  millionNew housebuilding 37 69 57 67Reduce to 30, 000 approvals in 1980instead of 1981;  curtail land acquisition,reduce unit costsCouncil house improvements/otherinvestment 30 45 35 35Reduce in 1980-81 to 95% of 1978-79 leveland to 85% from 1981-82 onwardsPrivate sector housing 55 60 65 6510% cut in pre sent spending on renovationgrants, abolish insulation grants, cutmortgage lending to 1977-78 level122174 157 1672SECRET
SECRETDEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT - OTHER6. In addition to savings already agreed in his other programmes, theSecretary of State for the Environment has offered further savings of 1 percent cumulatively in current expenditure on local environmental services, byreductions in manpower;  these are included in the figures in Annex A.EDUCATION7. In addition to the savings already offered, the Secretary of State forEducation and Science has agreed to make further savings of  20 million ayear from 1981-82, which he expects to achieve mainly by reducing theprovision for local authority higher education.    This will involve a reductionof about 10, 000 (or 5 per cent) in student numbers in polytechnics and colleges.We have also asked the Secretary of State for Education and Science to considera further cumulative 1 per cent reduction in the provision for non-teachingstaff in the education services which would yield savings rising to 34 million in 1983-84 (see Ai.nex A).HEALTH8. Our proposals involve raising the prescription Charge to  1 inDecember 1980 and replacing the present exemptions - which cause two-thirdsof all prescriptions tc be issued free - by a 50 per cent charge except for thoseon supplementary benefit and family income supplement.    This proposal yields 20 million in 1980-81 and about  120 million in subsequent years.    If theprescription is not raised from 70p to  1 in December, but is raised in thefollowing April to an amount necessary to maintain its real value, andexemptions are revised as proposed, the yield would be  10 million in 1980-81and about  80 million a year in later years.TRANSPORT9. The Minister of Transport has offered to increase his savings in1981-82 from  35 million to  40 million, as for the two later years.    (He isalso about to propose the sale to the private sector of a stake in the BritishTransport Docks Board, which would raise between  35 million and 60 million in 1981-82, provided that legislative authority can be obtained intime; this should reduce the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, andwould contribute to the sale of assets programme, but cannot be treated as acontribution to the present reductions in public expenditure. )AID10. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has agreed to furtherreductions in the overseas aid programme beyond those reported in ourprevious paper (C(80) 3) as follows:3SECRET
SECRETit m&apos;llion1980-81    1981-82    1982-83 1983-842 5 10 10EMPLOYMENTLI.      The Secretary of State foi Employment accepted annual savings of 30- 35 million before we discussed the extension of special employmentmeasures.    We have now agreed that we cannot afford to continue the SmallFirms Employment Subsidy, but that the Temporary Short-Time WorkingScheme and the Job Release Scheme should continue for a further year (thelatter in a substantially reduced form).    This will abate the savings by about 20 million in both 1980-81 and 1981-82.DEFENCE12. ij In the light of our Manifesto commitments, and the North AtlanticTreaty Organisation (NATO) 3 per cent target, we have not hitherto soughtmajor reductions on defence, but the Secretary of State for Defence has nowaccepted cuts of  62 million in 1980-81 and  10 million in 1981-82. Theapplication to defence of the same cash limits regime as for other programmesis likely to cause a further volume reduction in the defence programme nextyear, but | in line with the Manifesto commitment on Armed Forces pay - weaccept that the cash limits should be increased as necessary to accommodateany extra costs (above the provision included at the outset) arising from theimplementation of decisions on the forthcoming Armed Forces Pay ReviewBoard report.    They will also be subject to review during the year in the lightof developments in the international situation and NATO&apos;s response to them.The reduced 1980-81 figure ( 8 billion) will represent an increase of some3.6 per cent on the latest 1979-80 forecast outturn.    The reduced 1981-82 total( 8,240 million) will represent a 3 per cent increase, and to allow for further3 per cent increases and the possibility of some expenditure on Polarisreplacement, we are content that the comparable figures for total defenceexpenditure in the last two years of the Public Expenditure Survey periodshould be  8, 487 million and  8, 742 million respectively.FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE13. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has agreed to a reduction inthe Government&apos;s grant to the core budget of the British Council in future yearsby  3.9 million, gross of the costs of redundancy payments.    The net amountkill depend on the timing .of implementation of the reduction, which has still tobe decide 1.4SECRET
SECRETCASH LIMITS14. The cash limits agreed by the Cabinet in December are likely to cutthe volume of expenditure further in 1980-81.    We cannot assess the extent ofthis reduction until we have a new forecast of inflation, and the Cabinet shouldhave a further discussion of this aspect then.AGGREGATE EXPENDITURE15. We attach at Annex B a table of provisional totals of expenditure onthe assumption that the proposals in this paper are accepted. Theyincorporate additional savings found by the Home Secretary since our lastmeeting and some net additions to the Welsh programmes (see Annex A).CONTINGENCY RESERVE16. It is assumed in Annex B that savings from uprating child benefit byless than proposed by the Secretary of State for Social Services would bereflected by a corresponding reduction in the Contingency Reserve and thus intotal expenditure.    In view of the uncertain prospects in the nationalisedindustry sector, however, it would be premature to take a final decision nowon the Contingency Reserve which needs to be provided for 1980-81 and lateryear8.    We will bring forward a recommendation on this with the draft WhitePaper when the prospects will be clearer.CONCLUSION17. We invite the Cabinet:i. To decide the out standing issues on social security(paragraphs 3 and 4), housing (paragraph 5) and education(paragraph 7).ii. To endorse the other proposals for reductions in Annex A.iii. To note that a White Paper incorporating these proposals willnow be prepared for publication in March.G HJ BTreasury Chambers29 January 19805SECRET

SECRETSOCIAL SECURITYThe ProposalsThe agreed proposals are shown in Table 1 attached,the s considered by Cabinet last week in thata. EES is now proposed to be abolished from 1 January 1982instead of 1 January 1981.   This preserves entitlementarising from contributions already paid.b. The entitlement formula is nevertheless to be amendedfrom 1 January 1981 until abolition by reducing thereturn on earnings between  30 and  135 from 13 par centto 10 per cent.c. Certain short term benefits and invalidity benefits areto be uprated by 3 per cent, rather than 10 per cent, lessthan prices.d. T.jnif-i ng rules - spells of unemployment and sickness shouldbe linked only if they fall within 6 weeks of each otherrather than present 13-e. The proposal to abolish death grant is dropped.2. Additional proposals are shown in Table 2 attached. These are two variantsbut combinations axe possible*Views of the Secretary of State and the Chancellor on additional proposals3. The Secretary of State considers child benefit, which needs to go up bymore than  1 in November just to keep pace with prices since April 1979,should be raised across the board from SA to  3.   The importance of childbenefit to the incentives equation is that social security benefits arereduced   for   while the worker has the benefit in addition to wages. Thereare also now no child tax allowances and child benefit is the only significantmeans by which help may be given to the family man above the poverty line.ANNEX CThey mainly differ from1.SECRET
SECRETThere is evidence that a lot of the pressure for higher wages comes from mlwith family responsibilities. If personal tax allowances are price protecland child benefit not, the family man with children is singled out for unfjable treatment.k. Even if less than full price protection were given to child benefit thflSecretary of State does not consider that there should be any cut in the blsubsistence level for children on short term supplementary benefit. He poflout that of the   Billion children involved, 300,000 are in one-parent fan!families of the sick, for whom the incentives argument is not relevant; :hejwould therefore be small in relation to the total &quot;why work&quot; problem anyway!the political difficulties of selecting the childresn rates for cuts are o&apos;Moreover he thinks that such cuts would run entirely counter to the Gcverrdeclared policy being implemented in the Social Security Bill now be fare Fto switch supplementary benefit resources towards families with children oflmentary benefit because they of all groups find it most difficult to ^anagf5. The Secretary of State does not therefore consider either of the ;arijproposed is acceptable, but would be prepared to legislate to suspend theChristmas Bonus despite the difficulties in doing so.6. The Chancellor&apos;s view as to child benefit is that an increase of as muflas  1 is not justifiable in current circumstances. Price protection is noflrequired either by statute or by custom, and it is most undesirable to extindexation. The benefit itself goes indiscriminately to all with children,whether they are rich or poor; the arguments about poverty and incentivesapply to only a minority of recipients and would be met in part by thsproposed premium for the ^th and subsequent child. So far as suppleinentaribenefit goes, the Chancellor thinks that as a consequence of less than fullprice protection of child benefit childrens scale rates must be held back  the interests of work incentives, in the same way that broadly similar stelhave already been agreed in respect of child dependency allowances payablewith sickness and unemployment benefit. He notes that supplementary beneflevels are otherwise virtually untouched.SECRET
