CONFIDENTIALPAY: IN CONFIDENCEUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80)15 COPY NO 6526 February 1980CABINETCIVIL SERVICE CASH LIMITS:  PAY AND MANPOWERMemorandum by the Mini liter of State, Civil Service Department1. It is now essential to settle the size of the global cash limit for thepay of the non-industrial and industrial Civil Service so that negotiationswith the non-industrials, whose pay date is 1 April, can begin, and also tofit in with the general Estimates timetable.2. To take this decision, we have to consider:a. the overall size of the pay award to be made to non-industrialcivil servants from 1 April, and the contingent provision to be madefor the industrial pay settlement from 1 July; andb. the size of a compensating volume squeeze.3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s report from the Ministerial Groupon Cash Limits and Civil Service Pay (MISC 38) sets out some of the mainoptions.CASH LIMITS4. Cabinet decided on 13 December (CC(79) 25th Conclusions, Minute 7)that the provision for pay and price increases in public sector cash limits,other than those for Civil Service and Armed Forces pay, should be14 per cent.3.       The Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes in his latest paper(C(80) 14) that cash limits should be unchanged.    I am assuming in thispaper that Cabinet will endorse his proposals.   If cash limits in other fieldswere to change, then the situation on Civil Service pay might be verydifferent.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALPAY: IN CONFIDENCEPAY RESEARCH EVIDENCE6. The major part of the Pay Research Unit1 s evidence which, underthe terms of the Civil Service Pay Agreement, should serve as the basisfor this year&apos;s non-industrial settlement has now been received andexamined by my officials.    The Government Actuary has decided that thededuction for pensions should be increased from 2. 6 per cent to 3.8 per cent.By application of the most stringent criteria, the average level of increasein pay rates indicated by pay research is reduced to around 18f per cent.Every effort will be made in the course of negotiations to reduce this figure,but it is the lowest we could defend, if necessary at arbitration, asconsistent with the Pay Agreement.7. The Annex to this note describes the background.   As it makes clear,the unions have the right to go to arbitration.    Breaking the Pay Agreementcould only &quot;ve effective if we were to withdraw that right.THE PROBLEM8. If the cash limit for Civil Service pay were to provide for payincreases of 18$ per cent there would be a gap of just over 4 percentagepoints (ie, the equivalent of 4f per cent on the Estimates provision increasedby 14 per cent) as compared with the generality of other public service cashlimits.    This is a big difference and we need to consider how we cannarrow it.THE OPTIONS9. There are a number of options open to us.    The two extremes are:a. to decide on a cash limit which finances fully a pay researchsettlement of 18$ per cent; andb. to restrict the Civil Service pay settlement to a 14 per centincrease if that is the provision for cost increases made in publicservice cash limits generally.10. I believe that we should reject both these options, the first becauseit would be politically and financially unacceptable; and the second becauseof the grave consequences for industrial relations and hence the operationof Government.    We should have to expect the collapse of all order andrestraint in Civil Service pay negotiations.    We should, unlike anyprevious Government, have enlisted behind the militants the great bulk ofthe loyal staff.2CONFIDENTIALPAY: IN CONFIDENCE
CONFIDENTIALPAY: IN CONFIDENCE11. We must therefore look for an intermediate way of bridging the gap.The Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s memorandum (C(80) 16) suggests acombination of a manpower squeeze and a staging of the implementation ofthe pay settlement.STAGING12. When I saw the Staff Side recently they stressed their determinationthat the Government should honour the Pay Agreement, ie. that the full amountsdue should be paid from 1 April next.    They asked me to let my colleaguesknow the strength of their feeling.    They feel strongly about staging as wellas about the actual amount resulting from the pay research exercise. Itwas dissatisfaction about staging that led to last year* s troubles,13. Staging would be a breach of the Agreement and would require denialof the right to arbitration on the timing, but not the amount, of the increase.A modest degree of staging might not in itself cause the widespread industrialaction to be expected from an imposed cut on the size of the increase but ifit were taken beyond the limits discussed in the next paragraph we shouldrisk industrial action, in which management grades are likely to join, on amuch larger and more damaging scale than hitherto experienced. Mycolleagues can judge better than I what that might mean for their operations.14. We must consider the permutations in the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s paper (C(80) 16) against this background.    The unions arelikely to accept, however grudgingly, whatever degree of manpower squeezewe consider feasible if it is part of a successful attempt to avoid breakingthe Pay Agreement.    But the other possibilities of reducing the pay costare very limited.   It might be possible to shade the increase down to, say,18 per cent if, with a manpower squeeze, that enabled us to honour the PayAgreement, in particular to avoid staging.    If we have to consider goingbeyond that, my judgment is that a negotiated settlement consistent withthe Pay Agreement will be beyond reach.    In that situation our bestprospect of avoiding industrial action on a major scale will be to go for amodest amount of staging.    We should be inviting much worse trouble ifwe were to attack the amount of the increase itself.A SQUEEZE ON MANPOWER15. It follows therefore that we should go for the largest practicablesqueeze on manpower.    If nothing is done, our planned growth in manpowerin 1980-81 virtually cancels out the savings already agreed.    There will beno significant reduction next year in Civil Service numbers.    That will bequite unacceptable to our supporters.   On industrial relations grounds, also,I believe a squeeze will be the least damaging of a number of difficultcourses.3CONFIDENTIALPAY: IN CONFIDENCE
PAY:CONFIDENTIALIN CONFIDENCE16. Above all, I do ask my colleagues to consider the political effectof announcing an 18f per cent pay increase for the Civil Service, with onlya 1 per cent reduction in manpower.   Are we to see the British SteelCorporation lay off steel workers in South Wales and British Leylandthousands of car workers in the Midlands but to say that the size of ourown Departments can be reduced by only 1 per cent?   So the outcome wouldbe:a. pay increase of 18-j per cent;b. some degree of staging;c. a 1 per cent manpower squeeze;d. index-linked pensions to continue though with increasedcontributions.I find this package totally unacceptable politically.    Unless we takestronger steps on manpower we shall infuriate our supporters without evenavoiding the prospect of industrial action to boot.17. I am well aware that a further squeeze on manpower will not be easy,but there is an annual turnover of more than 10 per cent in Civil Servicestaff.   I do urge my colleagues to look at the wider interests of theGovernment as a whole and the need to have a package that we can alldefend publicly.    In spite of all the difficulties I do not believe we haveexhausted the possibilities for dropping work.    For all these reasons Ipropose that we do the same as last year, ie. have a further 3 per centsqueeze with the same limited exemptions as before.    Time simply doesnot permit a more sophisticated course.A RECRUITMENT BAN18. To achieve savings in staff costs of 3 per cent in a single year willcall for determined measures, and colleagues will wish to consider whetherwe should reinforce the cash squeeze by a general ban on recruitment, aswe did last year.   A ban would have the advantage of bringing numbers -and hence costs - down quickly and thus of reducing the size of the rundownrequired from a more gradual approach.    On the other hand, last year&apos;sexperience showed a ban to be a blunt and not altogether effective instrument.It was haphazard in incidence; it was often disruptive of efficiency;Ministers authorised exemptions to the extent of about SO per cent of normalrecruitment in order to recruit staff they considered essential.   A furtherban this year would be likely to do long-term damage to the ability of theCivil Service to recruit the people that on any reckoning we are going to need.If it is the only way to ensure that we strike our target, we should notflinch from it, but the scope for exemptions will need to be much more4CONFIDENTIALPAY: IN CONFIDENCE
CONFIDENTIALPAY: IN CONFIDENCErigorously confined.    My colleagues will wish to consider whether weshould adopt this course, and, if so, what the timing and duration of theban should be.REVIEW OF THE PAY RESEARCH SYSTEM19. There is certainly a case for a fundamental review of the payresearch system.    But if we still want an agreed and structured systemwhich imposes discipline on unions negotiators and fosters good industrialrelations we must accept that:a. there is virtually no possibility of negotiating with the unionsa different system which would meet these requirements, especiallyif the point of departure was unilateral breach by the Governmentof the present agreement;b. it would probably need the authority of a major enquiryboth to do justice to the subject and to secure the parties&apos;acceptance of a new system;c. We should need workable interim arrangements in the meantim20. There is no need to decide this issue today, and I suggest I should puta paper to xnr/ colleagues very shortly.CONCLUSION21. Of the options canvassed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a1 per cent squeeze on manpower would offer no hope of a negotiatedsettlement; only with a 3 per cent squeeze would I have any real degree ofconfidence that a negotiated settlement might be possible.    There are alsowider implications I have covered in my paper.    I therefore conclude:a. that we should go for a 3 per cent squeeze on manpower anda 1 per cent reduction on pay, preferably by negotiation but otherwiseby imposed staging;b. that I should be authorised to negotiate pay settlements forthe non-industrial Civil Service on the basis of a. ;c. that I should put a further paper to my colleagues on thefuture of the pay research system.P CCivil Service Department26 February 19805CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALANNEXPAY - IN CONFIDENCEivil Service   Pay Arrangementshe Pay AgreementsThe pay of the non-industrial Civil Service (about 550,000taff) is determined on the basis of fair comparison with theay of outside employees engaged on broadly comparable work,aking account of differences in conditions of service. Payesearch in accordance with this principle has operated since 1955ut the detailed methodology has been developed and improved,he current Pay Agreements date from 1974 and 1977 The 1974 Agreement provides for an annual pay researchettlement to be paid in full from 1 April each year.    It alsorescribes in detail how the evidence collected by thendependent Pay Research Unit is to be processed by managementnd unions to arrive at new pay rates for the Civil Service,he 1974 Agreement continues in force subject to the right ofither side to give 6 months notice of withdrawal from all orart of it.In 1977 as a condition for the re-activation of payesearch for 1979 a new Agreement complementary to the 1974greement provided various measures to strengthen the independencef the system.    In particular it established the Pay Researchnit Board (Chairman: Lord Shepherd Vice-Chairman:ir Derek Rayner) to oversee the work of the Unit and to ensurets integrity and independence.ondon WeightingSince 1974 London weighting has been determined, inommon with many other public sector bodies, by use of theormula devised by the Pay Board.    This is based on averagextra costs incurred by those working in London andequires the use of special price indices from the Departmentf Employment which are published in June.    London weighting isormaily reviewed annually with effect from 1 April.PAY - IN CONFIDENCECONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALPAY - IN CONFIDENCEArbitration5. The unions have access to arbitration under the terms ofthe Civil Service Arbitration Agreements on all aspects of thoperation of the pay research system and the fixing of Londonweighting. They can take cases to arbitration unilaterally odisputes up to and including Principal level. SuccessiveGovernments have nonetheless reserved the right to restrictaccess to arbitration on grounds of national policy, but thisright has been used very sparingly.Estimating the results of Pay Research6. The final date for the Pay Research Unit to update its reis 7 February.    There are over 600 reports each giving in detthe pay and conditions of service of a number of specific jofound by the Unit in an outside organisation to be analogousto the Civil Service grade in question.    By applying thedetailed rules of the Pay Agreements an adjusted pay rate cacalculated.    The reports have been analysed in the most striway, and wherever there was any doubt about the interpretatiof the evidence the lowest figure has been used.    Por eachgrade the negotiations centre on the median of the adjustedpay rates.   Because pay research is based on detailed job-fojob comparisons the median pay rates which result reflect thoutside market rates for each type of work covered. Thepercentage increases indicated for each grade can thus varyconsiderably from each other.    The estimate of 18.75% is anaverage of these rates for different grades and thus represethe lowest possible figure which could, if challenged, bedefended as being consistent with the Pay Agreements. Althoevery effort would be made in the course of negotiationsto reduce this figure, the actual outcome of negotiations wodepend critically on the attitude of the unions and on wheththey wished to take matters as far as arbitration.Industrial Civil Service7*     There are no formal pay or arbitration agreements forthe industrial Civil Service.   Their pay has however beendetermined on a broad basis of comparability for very manyCONFIDENTIAL

In the estimate it has been assumed that anncrease will be indicated of similar size to that for theon-indu st rial s  ost of a Pay Research SettlementThe provision being made in the 1980-81 Estimates for civilervice pay (including London Weighting and employers1 national|nsurance contributions) is about  4100m. A settlement of 18f96[or non-industrial staff would add about  635m to the pay bill;[his includes the estimated cost of London Weighting.    If there&apos;ere to be a settlement of the same size for industrial staff,his would cost, a further  95m.    The cash limit will includejlso provision for pay increases for staff in the Northernreland Civil Service and in certain fringe bodies whose pay isinked with that of the civil service.    This will add some  50m0 the size of the -cash limit, making about  780m in all.?CONFIDENTIAL
