ForewordParliament has, I believe, welcomed the regular reports on Communitymatters which have been published as White Papers at roughly six monthlyintervals and not least for the opportunity this allows for a wide-rangingdebate on Community issues. The Government intend to continue publishingthese reports but, in view of the pressures on Parliamentary time between theGeneral Election and the summer recess, decided to extend the times coveredby this report. This paper therefore gives a factual account of events anddevelopments under both administrations for the whole of 1979. It also aimsto give some indication of this Government&apos;s general approach to the Com-munity and of our policy on specific issues.This Government is whole-heartedly committed to British membership ofthe Community and to making it work for the good of all its Members. Weaim to play a full and positive role in the development of Community policies.A new start has been made. We, in common with other Member States, facemany problems, some of which have been with us for a number of years, andwe intend working hard to eliminate them and to ensure that the Communityoperates fairly for all. In some cases this can mean engaging in tough debate,but our objective is a healthy (and lively) Community which contributes to astronger and more prosperous Europe.The next White Paper in this series will resume the normal six-monthlycycle, and cover events from January to June 1980.I H GILMOURLORD PRIVY SEALiv
Section I: Introduction1.1 The Government&apos;s general approach to the European Community wasset out in The Queen&apos;s Speech on 15 May as follows &quot;My Government affirm their strong commitment to the EuropeanCommunity. They intend to play a full and constructive part in its furtherdevelopment and enlargement and in the co-ordination of the foreignpolicies of Member States. They will seek to make significant improve-ments in the operation of the common agricultural policy which will bein the interests both of the United Kingdom and of the Community as awhole, and they will work for an agreement on a common fisheries policywhich takes account of the need to conserve stocks and the interests ofour fishermen. They will press for a fairer pattern of budgetary andresource transfers in the European Economic Community. They welcomethe development of the European Monetary System and will considerafresh the question of the participation of the United Kingdom in itsvarious aspects.&quot;1.2 The Government have laid great emphasis on the need for a fairerpattern of budgetary and resource transfers within the Community. TheCommission have now calculated that the United Kingdom will in 1980 bemaking a net contribution to the Community Budget of over  1,000 million.This is much more than any other Member will pay. It is not a new problem.During the accession negotiations in 1970 the Community recognised that if&quot;unacceptable situations&quot; arose on our budget contributions, &quot;the very sur-vival of the Community would demand that the institutions find equitablesolutions&quot;. The Government have made clear to their Community partnersthat an adequate and durable solution is essential. At its meeting in Strasbourgon 21/22 June the European Council invited the Commission to examine thenature and scale of the problem in 1979 and 1980.1.3 The Commission subsequently issued a reference paper (COM(79)462) and a further document containing general proposals for solutions(COM(79) 680), both of which have been deposited with Parliament. At theEuropean Council in Dublin on 29/30 November, the United Kingdom wasoffered a revision of the 1975 financial mechanism, which would have reducedour net contribution by about a third, but on the understanding that therewould be no further offer beyond this. The offer was rejected as inadequateand it was eventually agreed that a further effort would be made to findagreement at the first European Council of 1980 to be held early if thePresidency judged it ripe to do so. The Government will continue to seek asolution fair to all, which takes account of both our excessive contribution andour low level of receipts.1.4 The growing and excessive cost of the Common Agricultural Policy(CAP), which is threatening to undermine the whole of the Community&apos;sactivities was a considerable anxiety. The cost arises principally on the disposalof surplus commodities such as dairy products, sugar and cereals and it canbest be controlled by holding down CAP support prices for the surplus1
commodities. The standstill in the support prices for milk products agreed atthe June meeting of the Agriculture Council represented a first step in thisprocess.1.5 Discussions on the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) continued. TheGovernment are working to secure an early settlement of the revised CFPwhich meets the Government&apos;s essential requirements on conservation, access,quota allocations and enforcement. In the meantime, the Government arecontinuing to operate the national conservation measures needed to protectfish stocks in waters under United Kingdom sovereignty or jurisdiction.1.6 Welcome progress was made towards the eventual admission to theCommunity of Greece, Portugal and Spain. The conclusion of the negotiationswith Greece, culminating in the signature on 28 May of the Treaty of Accessionproviding for Greek entry on 1 January 1981, and the opening of negotiationswith Spain were two important developments for the future of the Community.1.7 Among other external relations issues of particular interest to theUnited Kingdom, the new Lome Convention concluded on 31 October rep-resents an important consolidation and improvement of the existing Conven-tion; and a number of changes will directly benefit the Commonwealth ACPcountries.1.8 The Government welcome the successful conclusion of the MultilateralTrade Negotiations and the bilateral agreements. The Government havesupported efforts to examine possible barriers to trade both within and outsidethe Community.1.9 There has been much positive discussion in the Community of MemberStates&apos; responses to the oil supply difficulties of recent months. One result ofthese discussions has been the emergence of measures designed to improvethe information available on the working of the international oil markets.Agreement has also been reached on Community net oil import objectives forthe years 1980 to 1985, and on national net oil import objectives for 1985 asa contribution to restoring stability in the oil market.1.10 The Government have welcomed the first direct elections to theEuropean Parliament as a means of strengthening democracy in the Com-munity. They attach particular importance to close co-operation between thenew Parliament and the other Community institutions.Section II:  Political Co-operation2.1 The Nine Member States continued to consult and co-ordinate theirpositions on all major international questions.Middle East2.2 The last Government joined with other Member States in a statementon 26 March welcoming the Egypt-Israel Treaty as a proper application of the2
principles of Security Council Resolution 242 to relations between Egypt andIsrael.2.3 In this and subsequent statements, including the Presidency addressto the General Assembly of the United Nations on 24 September, the Ninereiterated the principles on which they believe a just, lasting and comprehen-sive settlement must be based. These include the need for Israel to end theterritorial occupation it has maintained since the conflict of 1967; the right ofall States in the area to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries;and the need to take account of the legitimate rights of Palestinians, includingthe right to a homeland. The Nine also deplored all actions which might hinderthe quest for peace, including the establishment of Israeli settlements in theoccupied territories. They called for an end to the violence in the Lebanonand expressed their concern at the harassment of the United Nations Inter-vention Force in Lebanon and the assistance from outside the Lebanon forthose who were making its work difficult.Iran2.4 The Nine made clear their concern at the seizure of the United StatesEmbassy in Tehran on a number of occasions; in particular the Nine Ambas-sadors in Tehran made a series of joint demarches to the authorities in Iran topress for the immediate release of the hostages and their better treatment inthe event that they should not be released at once. The European Council, on29/30 November, condemned Iran&apos;s failure to protect diplomatic missions anddeclared the taking of hostages in order to exert pressure on governments, tobe totally unacceptable. They called on all governments to oppose energeti-cally this breach of international law.Euro/Arab Dialogue2.5 During 1979 political developments affecting relations between Arabcountries resulted in the Dialogue being suspended (initially at the request ofthe Arab side). On 20 November Foreign Ministers agreed that the Nineshould contact the Arab League at Tunis with a view to examining ways ofresuming the Dialogue at a technical level.Indo-China2.6 Another area of special concern to the Nine was Indo-China. ForeignMinisters of the Nine supported the present Government&apos;s proposal for aninternational conference on this problem. The Nine stayed in close touchthroughout the conference and also acted together in Hanoi and other capitalsin the Far East to make known their concern at the plight of refugees andconditions which had given rise to the exodus. Later in the year the attentionof the Nine Member States focussed on the situation in Cambodia.2.7 The European Council on 29-30 November expressed its deep concernat the tragic situation in Cambodia. It recalled that the European Communityand its Member States were contributing substantially to international reliefefforts then under way and appealed to the parties concerned to ensure thatthe relief reached those in need.3
Africa2.8 The Nine continued to follow events in Africa closely. They wereregularly briefed by Ministers and officials, both in London and in othercapitals, on progress at the Lancaster House conference. In November Min-isters of the Nine made a statement welcoming the agreement on an inde-pendence constitution and urging the parties to agree on a ceasefire on thebasis of the Government&apos;s proposals. Consultation also took place in Decem-ber with a view to co-ordination among the Nine on the lifting of sanctionsfollowing the return to legality of Southern Rhodesia.2.9 The Nine have continued to support the proposals on Namibia putforward by the Five Western Countries.Judicial Co-operation2.10 In Dublin on 4 December Ministers of Justice of the Nine signed anAgreement by which, when ratified, Member States undertake to apply theEuropean Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism among themselves.The Nine continued their work, begun in earlier years, on the examination ofways of strengthening judicial co-operation to prevent criminals from benefit-ing from the freedom of movement which exists within the Community.Substantial progress was made on a draft convention dealing mainly withextradition.Section III:  Enlargement, External Relations, Trade and AidEnlargement3.1 The negotiations on the terms of Greece&apos;s entry into the Communitywere successfully concluded in April. The Treaty of Greek Accession wassigned in Athens on 28 May. Subject to the necessary ratifications of theTreaty, Greece will formally join the Community in January 1981. The UnitedKingdom were the first to ratify the Treaty, and our formalities were completedon 22 December. Following her signature of the Act of Accession arrange-ments were made for associating Greece more closely with the process ofPolitical Co-operation.3.2 Negotiations with Portugal continued. Four meetings at ambassadoriallevel were held. The negotiations with Spain opened formally in February.Subsequently the Community worked out a common basis of negotiation inpreparation for the substantive phase of the negotiations, which began with aMinisterial negotiating session in September and continued with anotherMinisterial session in December.General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT): Multilateral TradeNegotiations3.3 Discussions continued in early 1979 on the outstanding matters in thenegotiations. As a result, a proces verbal, embodying the main results of thenegotiations, was opened for signature by negotiators on 12 April. Afterconsulting the Foreign Affairs Council on 2-3 April, the Commission signed4
the proems verbal, along with the negotiators from the other main developedparticipants in the negotiations.(1)3.4 Discussions continued during the summer on the outstanding proposalsfor a safeguards agreement, and on certain other matters of particular interestto developing countries. In November the Council decided formally to con-clude the agreements which had been negotiated. The Community signed thevarious agreements together with other major developed country participantson 17 December.Textiles3.5 During the first four months of the year, the Community initialledagreements with Poland and Bulgaria. Under the terms of existing agreements,new quotas were introduced on certain products imported from India, thePhilippines and Taiwan. Community negotiations with Portugal and Tunisiafor voluntary restraint arrangements covering 1979 and beyond were success-fully completed.3.6 Since May, fourteen quotas have been introduced on imports of anumber of products; these include combed wool from Argentina, Brazil andUruguay, cotton yarn from Turkey and on other products from Hong Kongand Poland. In July the Community initialled a bilateral agreement with Chinain Peking. In addition, voluntary restraint agreements have been initialledwith Malta and Cyprus.Japan3.7 The six-monthly Community/Japanese high level consultations wereheld in Tokyo on 11 May and 27 November-1 December. The EuropeanCouncil on 21/22 June emphasised the need for continuing close consultationsabout economic problems and expressed the hope that this would enablebroader and more equitable relations to be envisaged.India3.8 The Commission held exploratory talks with India in the early part ofthe year about the form and content of a new commercial and economic co-operation agreement to replace the agreement signed in 1974.3.9 Since May the Community has been drawing up the terms of anegotiating mandate for the Commission.Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)3.10 Following exploratory talks between the Commission and theASEAN secretariat about the possible content of a co-operation agreementbetween the Community and ASEAN, a negotiating mandate for the Com-mission has been drawn up. The Commission opened negotiations withASEAN in November and a draft agreement was approved by the ForeignAffairs Council in December.(1) The results of the negotiations are described in Cmnd 7657-7668 and 7724 published inOctober 1979 and Cmnd 7774 and 7778 published in December.5
China3.11 The first meeting of the Joint Committee set up to oversee theworkings of the April 1978 trade agreement between the Community andChina took place in Peking in July 1979. The development of trade betweenChina and the Community was discussed.Yugoslavia3.12 The February Foreign Affairs Council agreed the Community nego-tiating directive for a new Community/Yugoslavia Agreement.3.13 A first round of negotiations was held in early July. Subsequentlythere have been contacts between the Commission and the Yugoslavs to clarifypositions.European Free Trade Area (EFTA)3.14 Discussions within the Community/EFT A Ad Hoc Group continuedduring the first half of the year on the subject of increased co-operation withthe EFT A countries and in June the Foreign Affairs Council endorsed afurther report setting out specific proposals. The EFT A countries themselveshave reacted favourably to the Community&apos;s ideas.The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA)3.15 Without replying direcly to the new proposals put forward by theCommunity in November 1978, the CMEA Secretary-General wrote to theCommission in June suggesting a redraft of some parts of the draft agreementproposed by the CMEA in February 1976. Negotiations then took place inMoscow in late November when the Community put forward a fresh draftagreement. It was agreed that a drafting group should meet in February orMarch 1980 to prepare for a further round of negotiations no later than April1980.3.16 There are still some serious difficulties, but the Community remainsresolved to pursue the negotiations with the aim of establishing a betterworking relationship with both the CMEA and its Member States, and willrespond in this sense.Lome Convention3.17 The annual meeting of the Community/Africa, Caribbean and PacificGroup of States (ACP) Council of Ministers took place at Free port, Bahamason 22 March and reviewed the working of the Convention during the previoustwelve months.3.18 The negotiations for a successor convention which began in Septem-ber 1978 continued through most of the first half of 1979. A Community/ACPMinisterial negotiating conference took place in Freeport on 22-24 March.3.19 The negotiations intensified from May onwards. Further Ministerialnegotiating conferences took place in Brussels on 24 25 May and 25-27 June.
At the last of these conferences the text of a new and improved conventionwas substantially agreed. The new Convention was signed in Lome&quot; on 31October.Mediterranean3.20 A number of aid projects under the Financial Protocols to theMediterranean Agreements were approved under an ad hoc procedure, pend-ing the completion of a conciliation process between the Council and theParliament concerning institutional/financial arrangements. The first Co-operation Council with Morocco was held on 12 June.Latin America3.21 Continuing the Community&apos;s dialogue with Latin America, Ambas-sadors from Latin America and the Member States met in Brussels on 13 June.The meeting reviewed trade relations and discussed ways of intensifying thedialogue. In October a new tripartite high level group consisting of thePresident of the Latin American Group of Ambassadors, the Chairman inOffice of the Committee of Permanent Representatives and the DirectorGeneral of DGI in the Commission, held its first meeting.3.22 In July the President of the Commission received President Turbayof Colombia in Brussels and said that the Commission were ready to beginexploratory talks with representatives of the Andean Pact on the form andcontent of a possible co-operation agreement between the Community andthe Andean Pact.North/South Dialogue3.23 Community co-ordination has been pursued on North/South matters,including UNCTAD V in May, the Common Fund, the UN Committee of theWhole and the new International Development Strategy. One of the mostpositive features of UNCTAD V, preparations for which were begun duringthe last Government&apos;s term of office, was the very close co-operation withinthe Community which made a substantial contribution to the development ofcommon positions in the West as a whole. This was a marked improvementon UNCTAD IV in Nairobi.Anti-Dumping/Countervailing3.24 The Community&apos;s anti-dumping legislation was further amended inAugust to include more precise rules for the adjustments necessary whenobtaining a fair comparison between export and domestic prices, an improvedprocedure for calculating price comparisons against imports from non-marketeconomy countries and also clarification of certain injury rulings. The proce-dure for collection of provisional duties in certain circumstances has also beenrevised.3.25 A new Community Regulation, coming into force in January 1980,will reflect the results of the 1979 GATT Agreements and the opportunity hasbeen taken to clarify some of the existing rules and procedures. It will ensurethat Community legislation conforms with the new agreement on the imple-7
mentation of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the GATT which deals withsubsidies and countervailing measures which may be taken against them andthe consequential amendments to the existing agreement on the implemen-tation of Article VI of the GATT (the Anti-Dumping Code).Intra-Community Trade The Role of Standards and Certification Procedures3.26 As a result of growing concern among Member States and theCommission it was agreed in February that a Study Group of senior officialsshould be set up to examine the problems which have arisen from the way inwhich standards and certification procedures are used by some Member Statesto impede the free movement of products from other Member States into theirown territory. The Group completed its work in October.3.27 On standards the Group proposed a closer relationship between theCommission and the two European standards bodies (CEN and CENELEC)and a greater commitment by Member States to the work of these bodies.Means for achieving this are now being pursued by the Commission.3.28 On certification procedures the Group suggested that a WorkingParty should be formed under the Chairmanship of the United Kingdom toexamine the problems in this area. The Working Party will have its firstmeeting in January 1980. 400 organisations in the United Kingdom have beeninvited to submit evidence to this Working Party.Aid to Non-Associated Developing Countries3.29 On 23 October the Development Council approved the Commis-sion&apos;s project proposals for spending the 110 MEUA (about  71 million)(l)allocated to non-associates aid in 1979 in accordance with the general guide-lines agreed by Development Ministers in October 1978. Pending enactmentof a regulation making non-associates aid a permanent feature of Communitydevelopment policy, similar ad hoc guidelines were also agreed for 1980.Food Aid3.30 On 8 May the Foreign Affairs Council approved Community FoodAid Programmes for 1979 including 1,287,000 tonnes of cereals (of which720,500 tonnes will be Community financed), 150,000 tonnes dried skimmedmilk, and 45,000 tonnes of butteroil. The United Kingdom share of the costof the above programmes is estimated at about  40 million.Section IV:  Agriculture and FisheriesThe Common Agricultural Policy Price Fixing4.1 The Commission&apos;s proposals for common prices in 1979-80 and relatedmeasures were presented in January and discussed subsequently in the Coun-cil. A settlement was reached on 18-22 June which included a standstill onsupport prices for milk and milk products (the first since we joined theCommunity), price increases of 1.5 per cent on almost all other products and(1) Converted at late December market rate of 1.54 eua =  1.8
thus an average price increase over all commodities of 1.2 per cent (the lowestincrease since our accession). There was no change in the co-responsibilitylevy on milk producers but increases were agreed in the butter and schoolmilk subsidies. The Commission withdrew its proposals to reduce nationalquotas for sugar. In several Member States support price levels were alsoraised in national currency terms by green rate changes but, taking account ofcost increases, the settlement still represented a reduction in real terms insupport prices on average in the Community. For the United Kingdom thecost of the settlement was outweighed by increased receipts in particular fromthe butter subsidy, and the impact on prices was very small; but there was anincrease in support prices for our producers.Monetary Arrangements4.2 During the early part of the period, discussion in the AgricultureCouncils was dominated by the French reluctance to allow the new EuropeanMonetary System (EMS) to start without agreement on the treatment of anynew Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) which might arise throughsubsequent currency realignments. At the Council of 5-6 March, all MemberStates except the United Kingdom agreed that new positive MCAs (ie thosearising from the revaluation of a currency such as the German Mark) shouldbe dismantled in two years, provided this did not cause a drop in prices innational currency in the country concerned; and that new negative MCAs (iethose arising from a devaluation) should be similarly treated provided this didnot cause a rise in national prices which could lead to economic difficulties forthe country concerned.4.3 Following the start of EMS on 13 March the Council agreed at its26-30 March meeting to adopt the European Currency Unit (ECU) for CAPpurposes until 30 June. It also agreed to devaluations of the green currenciesof France (5.12 per cent), Irish Republic (0.3 per cent), Italy (9 per cent intwo stages) and the United Kingdom (5 per cent).4.4 Further changes were made in the green rates of various MemberStates at the Council of 18-22 June when the German and Benelux greencurrencies were revalued by 1.1 per cent and 0.55 per cent respectively (exceptin the milk sector), while the French and United Kingdom rates were devaluedby 1.5 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. This Council also extended the useof the ECU for CAP purposes until 31 March 1980. To offset the effects onMember States&apos; MCAs of the realignment of the EMS currencies decided byFinance Ministers on 23 September the informal meeting of AgricultureMinisters in Dublin on 26 September agreed to a devaluation of the greencurrencies of Denmark (3.8 per cent), France (1 per cent), Irish Republic (1per cent), Italy (1.1 per cent) and the United Kingdom (1.1 per cent). Thisagreement was subsequently confirmed by the written procedure.4.5 At the Fisheries Council on 3-4 December, it was decided to devaluethe Danish green rate (by about 4.63 per cent) in order to make it again equalto the Danish central rate under EMS, which had been devalued with effectfrom 30 November, thereby avoiding the need to introduce MCAs for Den-mark. The Agriculture Council on 10-11 December agreed to devalue the9
United Kingdom and Italian green rates by about 5 per cent and 5.04 per centrespectively.4.6 The four devaluations of the green pound and consequent reductionin MCAs have enabled producers and processors in the United Kingdom tocompete on fairer terms with those in other Member States.Economies in the Common Agricultural Policy4.7 Towards the end of the year, the Commission put forward proposalsintended to secure savings in the cost of the CAP. The main elements in theseproposals are: an increase in the existing &quot;co-responsibility levy&quot; in the milksector and a new supplementary levy related to increases in production;reductions in sugar quotas; changes in the intervention arrangements for beef;and the phasing out of the subsidies on grain used for starch. The Council hada preliminary discussion of the proposals at its meeting on 10-11 December,and will return to them during the early part of 1980.European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)4.8 In May the Council approved a Regulation on the amount ofmoney appropriated to the Guidance section of the EAGGF. Since 1973 thisamount has been 325 million European units of account (MEUA) (about  211million)(l) per annum; from 1 January 1980 a five year ceiling of 3600 MEUA(about  2,338 million)(l) will apply. The Mansholt reserves which can be usedto supplement the present annual allocation will be discontinued. Any amountremaining in the reserve at the end of 1979 will be subsumed into the newceiling.Milk and Milk Products4.9 As part of the June agreement of agricultural prices for the 1979-80marketing year, the Council decided to freeze the common prices for milkand milk products at the same level as in 1978-79. It was also agreed that theco-responsibility levy on milk production should be maintained at its existinglevel of 0.5 per cent of the target price. The Council authorised the paymentin the United Kingdom of a special butter subsidy, wholly financed by theCommunity, now worth 7p per 250g pack of Community butter (includinghome-produced) and also agreed that a corresponding subsidy should be paidon New Zealand butter through a reduction in the special levy. Separatesubsidy arrangements were authorised for other Member States. Furtherdecisions which were taken at the same meeting as part of the overall packageof measures were: to increase the Community subsidy on school milk to over7p a pint; to agree in principle on the suspension of aids to investment in themarketing and processing of butter and milk powder; to authorise the contin-ued payment by the United Kingdom of a special aid to milk producers inNorthern Ireland; and to extend the non-marketing and conversion premiumscheme for one year.4.10 On 25 July the Commission adopted a Regulation, in accordancewith a Council Regulation of 20 June 1978, laying down detailed provisions(1) Converted at late December market rate of 1.54 eua =  1.10
and supervisory measures relating to the United Kingdom milk marketingboards. This Regulation also authorised the United Kingdom to grant to themilk marketing boards the rights to buy all the milk produced in their areasand to equalise the price paid to all producers irrespective of the final use towhich the milk is put.Potatoes, Mutton and Lamb and Alcohol4.11 Discussions continued on the Commission&apos;s proposals for commonmarket organisations for potatoes, mutton and lamb and ethyl alcohol.4.12 The European Court ruled against the United Kingdom main croppotato import ban on 29 March and the ban was lifted with effect from 10April. A further judgment of the Court on 25 September ruled against theFrench sheepmeat import controls. France has not so far complied with thejudgment and the Commission has taken preliminary steps towards furthercourt proceedings with a view to ensuring compliance.Wine4.13 In December the Council reached agreement on a package of meas-ures designed to reduce the wine surplus and restore the balance betweensupply and demand on the wine market.Animal Feedingstuffs4.14 A Directive on the composition, labelling and marketing of com-pound animal feedingstuffs, including pet foods, was adopted by the Councilin April. The Council also agreed to defer the implementation of the associatedDirective on the marketing of straight feedingstuffs from 1 January 1979 to 1January 1981 so as to enable Member States to introduce the two measuresinto national law at the same time.Olive Oil4.15 In March the Community played an active role in negotiations underthe UNCTAD integrated programme for commodities. A new internationalolive oil agreement was agreed and will come into force on 1 January 1980; itcontains no price stabilisation provisions but provides for funding of projectsto improve olive cultivation and measures to increase olive oil consumption.Structural Measures4.16 In January the Council adopted a Directive providing for a pro-gramme to promote drainage in catchment areas of land on both sides of theborder between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. The programme isto be jointly implemented by the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom and50 per cent of its costs up to 15 MEUA (about  10 million)(l) will bereimbursed from Community funds.4.17 In March the Commission published a new package of structuralmeasures. In part the package comprised amendments to the existing structuralDirectives with the aim of channelling aid to smaller farms. In addition there(1) Converted at late December market rate of 1.54 eua= l.
were several schemes designed to help less favoured areas of the Communitywhich are highly dependent on agriculture (including the Western Isles ofScotland) and to improve pig-meat processing plants in France and the UnitedKingdom. No agreement was reached on the package.4.18 In December the Commission allocated 500,000 EUA (about 325,000)(1) from their Emergency Aid fund to farmers and crofters in theScottish Highlands whose production has been seriously affected by adverseweather over a long periodAnimal Health and Welfare4.19 Derogations were progressive extended during 1979, on the one handto the end of December 1980 to allow for the adaptation of national measuresfor the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis and, on the other,to the end of June 1980 to enable national controls to be applied to reduce therisk of swine fever being introduced in pigs and pigmeat imported from otherMember States. Work progressed on the harmonisation of the remainingprocedures dealing with brucellosis and tuberculosis and on draft regulationson swine fever. Among other proposals considered were measures for dealingwith enzootic bovine leukosis in cattle and for safeguarding the animal healthstatus of meat products entering Community trade.4.20 The Council received the Commission&apos;s proposals for developing theexisting safeguards of Directive 77/489 which protects the welfare of animalsduring international transport. These matters were remitted for discussion attechnical level. The Council also invited the Commission to make proposalsto bring to an end, after a period of years, the systems of keeping laying hensin battery cages as currently practised in the Community, and to proposeinterim measures. Towards this end, the Commission were asked to report onsystems of egg production which would be able to satisfy animal healthrequirements and those of hygiene and social ethics and which would takeeconomic consideration into account.FisheriesInternal Regime4.21 Little progress was made in negotiations on the Common FisheriesPolicy (CFP) in early 1979. In February the Council decided to extend until30 June the internal interim measure adopted in December 1978 requiringMember States to exercise a measure of control over fishing by their fleets inthe light of scientific recommendations. In March, it was agreed to extend foranother year the 1978 interim measures on aid for the inshore sector.4.22 The United Kingdom maintained in force national conservationmeasures adopted in previous years. In February, the Commission sought aruling from the European Court of Justice on the compatibility with Com-munity law of certain United Kingdom measures adopted in 1978 controllingherring fishing in the Irish Sea and prohibiting fishing for Norway pout in areasoff North East Britain.(1) Converted at late December market rate of 1.54 eua= l.12
4.23 At the Fisheries Council in June the Government stated requirementsfor an acceptable settlement of the revised CFP and announced their intentionsto consult bilaterally other Member States to assess their views and theprospects for progress in negotiations. The Council extended the interiminternal measures to 30 October.4.24 On 1 July the Government implemented national measures specifyingincreased minimum mesh sizes for fishing nets and related measures. InNovember, the Commission sought a further ruling from the European Courtof Justice on the compatibility with Community law of certain of thesemeasures and those adopted in 1979 regulating herring fishing in the Irish Sea.4.25 At the Fisheries Councils in October and December there were signsof a more constructive approach to the CFP negotiations. The interim internalmeasures were extended to 31 March 1980. In December the Council agreedin principle to decide at its next meeting in January on Total AllowableCatches (TACs) for 1980, and provided that a satisfactory agreement wasreached on 1980 TACs, to make a decision at the same time on the introductionin 1980 of a catch reporting scheme.External Regime4.26 The February Fisheries Council approved the signature of a short-term framework fisheries agreement between the Community and Canada,opening the way to fishing by Member States&apos; vessels in Canadian waters in1979. The Council agreed in December to ratify this agreement in order toclear the way for negotiations with Canada about a successor agreement.4.27 In March, reciprocal fishing arrangements with Norway, Sweden andthe Faroe Islands, previously negotiated by the Commission, were approvedand agreement was reached on the division among Member States of 1979Community quotas in these countries&apos; waters. Approval was also given toarrangements for Spanish fishermen to fish in Member States&apos; waters at areduced level compared with 1978.4.28 Approval was given in June to the signature and provisional imple-mentation of a framework fisheries agreement between the Community andSenegal. The agreement gives Member States&apos; fishermen access to Senegalesewaters for an initial period of two years in exchange for a payment ofapproximately US$11.4 million and payment of licence fees by the fishermenconcerned.4.29 Approval was also given in June to 1979 quotas for Canadian vesselsfishing off West Greenland.4.30 A mandate for negotiations with Mauritius and the Seychelles wasagreed by the Council in December.13
Section V:   Economic, Budgetary and Monetary QuestionsEconomic and Monetary Co-operationThe European Monetary System (EMS)5.1 The EMS, created by a resolution of the European Council in Decem-ber 1978, started to operate on 13 March after the French had lifted reserveson the Community legal instruments that were necessary for the start of theSystem. Since then the System has operated without major difficulties. Thereview of certain aspects of the EMS, due to take place 6 months after thestart of the System, was concluded at the September meeting of the FinanceCouncil without any changes to the System. On 23 September there was arealignment of currencies within EMS in response to market pressures; theGerman mark was revalued by 2 per cent and the Danish krone devalued by3 per cent. There was a further S per cent devaluation of the Danish krone on29 November.5.2 At the European Council in Strasbourg in June, the Prime Ministerannounced that we would participate in the revolving swap of 20 per cent ofour gold and dollar reserves for ECUs issued by the European Monetary Co-operation Fund. This indicated that whatever the outcome of the Govern-ment&apos;s review of the question of sterling&apos;s membership of the exchange ratemechanism, they wished to take an active part in the development of theCommunity&apos;s monetary institutions.5.3 The December Finance Council was given a report on the preliminarydiscussions that have taken place on the structure of a European MonetaryFund.Convergence and the financing of the Community Budget5.4 The principal subject under discussion in the Finance Council through-out this period was the implication of Community policies for the Community&apos;sdeclared aim of promoting convergence of economic performance betweenMember States. In this connection particular attention was paid to the patternof net contributions to the Community Budget. The same issue was a majoritem on the agenda of the three meetings of the European Council in March,June and November.5.5 These discussions continued those begun in the second half of 1978when, in connection with the plans for establishing the EMS, the EuropeanCouncil asked the Economic Policy Committee to carry out a study of theaction required to strengthen the economies of the less prosperous MemberStates. A further report by the Commission on the role that Communityinstruments might play in bringing about convergence was considered by theEuropean Council in March. The Council then invited the Finance Council toexplore the matter in greater depth and to submit their findings in time fordiscussion at the European Council meeting in June.5.6 At the Finance Council&apos;s request, the task of preparing this report waslargely undertaken by the Co-ordinating Committee on Short-Term Economic14
Policies. The documents eventually submitted to the European Council, whichincluded a summary of the main report prepared by the Committee ofPermanent Representatives, revealed a sharp difference of view on the eco-nomic impact of Community policies between the United Kingdom and Italyon the one hand, and the rest of the Community on the other. The formerargued that these policies had given rise to a totally inequitable state of affairs,in which they were transferring resources on a substantial scale through theCommunity Budget to other Member States significantly more prosperousthan ourselves. The latter regarded this contention as exaggerated, maintain-ing in particular that the pattern of net contributions to the Community Budgetdid not provide a reliable guide to the overall economic effect of Communitypolicies.5.7 The Prime Minister secured agreement at the June meeting of theEuropean Council that the Commission should first be asked to submit areference paper on the financial consequences for each Member State ofoperating the Community&apos;s existing budgetary system in 1979 and 1980, andthen on the basis of the Council&apos;s discussion of this paper to put forwardproposals for resolving any problems that it identified sufficiently early toenable decisions to be taken at its November meeting.5.8 The Finance Council considered the Commission&apos;s reference paper attheir meeting on 17 September, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer re-stated the United Kingdom case and took up the European Council&apos;s invitationto Member States to &quot;present their requests in concrete form&quot;. The FinanceCouncil reverted to the topic at their October and November meetings. InNovember they also had before them the Commission paper on possiblesolutions to the problems set out in the reference paper.5.9 When the European Council returned to this subject at its meeting on29-30 November it had before it both Commission papers,and a further paperby the Commission, which discussed in rather greater detail some of theoptions for a solution. Heads of Government did not, however, find it possibleto agree on corrective measures acceptable to the United Kingdom. The otherMember States recognised that the Community&apos;s budgetary arrangementsposed a problem for the United Kingdom, but they differed from the UnitedKingdom Government in their assessment of its nature and of the scale ofaction that would be required to remedy it. The most they were ready to offerwas amendment to the existing Financial Mechanism, which would havereduced the United Kingdom&apos;s net contribution by about  350m in 1980. Acut of one third, which is all this would have involved, was unacceptable tothe Government.5.10 The European Council did however agree to ask the Commission tobring forward proposals for developing supplementary Community measureswhich would lead to increased Community expenditure in the United King-dom. The Government hope that these proposals, when they are available,will form the basis for a satisfactory settlement. The Prime Minister has madeit clear that the United Kingdom is prepared to join with its partners in thesearch for a genuine compromise but that there is not much room for man-15
oeuvre. Movement on the United Kingdom side would have to be matched bymovement by other Member States for instance in their readiness to act toincrease United Kingdom receipts to an extent which recognises the gravity ofits present budgetary problem. The Italian Prime Minister, as the next Presi-dent of the Council, will call a further meeting of the Council as soon as hejudges that the conditions are ripe for a satisfactory settlement.Other Finance Council Business5.11 Finance Ministers continued their regular reviews of the economicsituation in the Community, with particular reference to the possible impactof the disturbances in the world oil market that occurred in the early part ofthe year. In February they agreed the text of a statement for the Presidencyto make on the Community&apos;s behalf at the meeting of the Interim Committeeof the International Monetary Fund, and in September another statement tobe similarly delivered at the Fund&apos;s annual meeting in Belgrade. At theDecember meeting Finance Ministers adopted the Commission&apos;s AnnualEconomic Report for 1979 and the guidelines for economic policy in 1980contained therein.5.12 On 14 May the Council adopted rules of eligibility for the newCommunity loan instrument of 1,000 MEUA (about  650 million)(l) that hadbeen agreed at its October 1978 meeting. The first loans under it were signedat a short ceremony after the September Council.5.13 At its July Meeting, the Council agreed a Regulation providing forthe payment of interest rate subsidies on Community loans made to lessprosperous Member States participating in the exchange rate arrangements ofthe EMS.Budgetary QuestionsThe 1979 Community Budget5.14 A dispute arose at the end of 1978 because the Council believed theform in which the European Parliament had adopted the 1979 Budget to beincompatible with the requirements of the Treaties. This dispute was even-tually settled on the basis of the first Preliminary Draft Supplementary andAmending Budget for 1979 proposed by the Commission in February. Thisintroduced new provision of 245 MEUA (about  155 million)(2) for EMSinterest rate subsidies and modified commitment appropriations for theRegional Development Fund to 945 MEUA (about  595 million)(2). TheCouncil agreed to these proposals on 22 March. At the same time, eightMember States, including the United Kingdom, approved the text of anentry in the minutes designed to avoid a repetition of the situation in whichthe Council&apos;s decision on the maximum rate of increase applicable to non-obligatory expenditure cannot be reconciled with its decisions on individualbudget entries.5.15 The Parliament adopted the First Supplementary and AmendingBudget on 25 April. Following Council agreement, a Second Supplementary(1) Converted at late December market rate of 1.54 eua =  1.(2) Converted at the rate of 1.5875 eua =  1 used by the Commission for 1979 Budget purposes.16
Budget providing for the anticipated additional needs of the enlarged directly-elected Parliament, was adopted on 11 May. As a result of these changes,total appropriations provided for in the 1979 Budget rose to 13,716 MEUA(about  8,640 million)(l) for payments and 14,697 MEUA (about  9,258million)(l) for commitments.5.16 The Joint Foreign Affairs/Finance Council on 2 April discussed aGlobal Appraisal by the Commission of the budgetary problems of theCommunity, and also suggestions by the Commission for financing the Budgetwhen the present ceiling on own resources revenue is reached.5.17 The Commission later prepared a Preliminary Draft Supplementaryand Amending Budget (PDSAB) No. 3 for the financial year 1979 to providefor additional expenditure on the CAP of 802 MEUA (about  505 million)(l)and on refunds to Member States in respect of own resources collection costsamounting to 29.28 MEUA (about  18 million)(l).5.18 The Council considered the PDSAB on 29 October and establisheda Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget (DSAB) No. 3 for the financialyear 1979 in which the additional expenditure on the CAP was restricted to702 MEUA (about  442 million)(l). This was forwarded to the EuropeanParliament for consideration.5.19 The European Parliament was concerned at the delay in the presen-tation of the PDSAB and at what it regarded as the Council&apos;s arbitrary actionin cutting the proposed additional expenditure on the CAP by 100 MEUA(about  63 million)(l). Thus, when asked by the Council to deal with theDSAB under the urgency procedure, the European Parliament declined andin the event the DSAB was not approved by the European Parliament until13 December. Before the DSAB was adopted, the Council agreed to theParliament&apos;s proposal to provide an extra 100 MEUA in appropriations forthe CAP Guarantee Section by means of transfers of surpluses from theGuidance Section. By that time, the Commission had run out of 1979 Budgetappropriations for the Guarantee Section and had had to authorise advancesto Member States on the basis of appropriations becoming available from the1980 Budget. With the adoption of the Third Supplementary and AmendingBudget, these advances will now, however, be set against the appropriationsmade available from the 1979 Budget.The 1980 Community Budget ff ! 5.20 The Commission&apos;s Preliminary Draft Budget amounted to 14,997MEUA(2) for payment appropriations and 16,625 MEUA(2) for commitmentappropriations, approximately equivalent to  10,125 million and  11,223million, respectively, at the rate of exchange assumed for the Commissionwhen drawing up its proposals.(3) These also included certain assumptionsabout the outcome of the agricultural price-fixing which differed from the(1) Converted at the rate of 1.5875 eua =  1 used by the Commission for 1979 Budget purposes.(2) Subsequently both amounts were reduced by 9 MEUA (about  6 million) owing to changesin the Preliminary Draft Budget of the Council.(3) Converted at the rate of 1.4813 eua =  1 used by the Commission for 1980 Budget purposes.17
decisions subsequently taken by the Agriculture Council on 22 June. TheCommission therefore presented a Letter of Amendment increasing paymentand commitment appropriations alike by 1,316 MEUA (about  888 million)(l)to new totals of 16,313 MEUA (about  11,013 million)(l) and 17,941 MEUA(about  12,112 million)(l), respectively.5.21 The First Budget Council, which had to be postponed from 23 Julyuntil 11 September, established the Draft Budget with provision of 14,907MEUA (about  10,063 million)(l) for payments and 15,325 MEUA (about 10,788 million)(l) for commitments. This was later amended to 15,981MEUA (about  10,345 million)(l) in payment appropriations and 16,399MEUA (about  11,070 million)(l) in commitment appropriations, the mainadditional expenditure being for the CAP Guarantee of over 360 MEUA(about  243 million)(l).5.22 The European Parliament considered the 1980 Draft Budget andreferred it back to the Council with certain amendments and modificationsprincipally in the areas of the Social Fund, Regional Fund and the CAP. TheDraft Budget as amended by the European Parliament totalled 15,636 MEUA(about  10,556 million)(l) in payment appropriations and 17,987 MEUA(about  12,143 million)(l) in commitment appropriations.5.23 The Draft Budget as amended by the European Parliament wasreconsidered by the Council on 23 November (the Second Budget Council).The Council held a preliminary discussion with a delegation from the EuropeanParliament led by its President and the views of the delegation were consideredbefore the Council took its decisions on the Parliament&apos;s detailed proposals.Although the Council was disposed not to reject a number of the Parliament&apos;samendments, the total involved greatly exceeded the maximum rate ofincrease for non-obligatory expenditure in the 1980 Budget and there was noqualified majority in the Council to increase the maximum rate. The Councilwas therefore only able to accept amendments proposed by the Parliamenttotalling 87 MEUA (about  59 million)(l) in payment appropriations and justover 255 MEUA (about  172 miIIion)(l) in commitment appropriations.5.24 The 1980 Draft Budget as it emerged from the Second Budget Counciltotalled 15,412 MEUA (about  10,404 million)(l) for payment appropriationsand 16,654 MEUA (about  11,243 milIion)( 1) for commitment appropriations,and required a VAT rate of 0.77 per cent. On this basis, the United Kingdomgross contribution was estimated to be 3,246 MEUA (about  2,191 million)(l).5.25 The Budget Council met on 12-13 December both separately and onseveral occasions with a Delegation from the European Parliament. TheCouncil carefully considered the views of the Parliament on the decisionstaken by the Council on the 1980 Draft Budget. Bearing in mind the provisionsof Article 203(9) of the Treaty of Rome relating to the possible fixing byagreement between the Council and the Parliament of a new maximum rate,the Council indicated to the Parliament its readiness to agree to an increaseof 200 MEUA (about  135 million)(l) in non-obligatory expenditure abovethat decided by the Council on 23 November.(1) Converted at the rate of 1.4813 eua    1 used by the Commission for 1980 Budget purposes.18
5.26 On 13 December the European Parliament adopted a Resolutionwhich, after dissenting from the Council&apos;s views on the 1980 Draft Budget asmodified by the Council, rejected that Draft Budget and called upon theCommission to present a new Parliamentary Draft Budget for 1980 on thebasis of which the Council would present a new Draft Budget to theParliament.5.27 In the absence of an agreed Budget for 1980, certain provisions ofArticle 204 of the Treaty of Rome, the Financial Regulation of 21 December1977 and of Regulation 2891/77 will now come into operation from thebeginning of 1980; they relate to a limitation on monthly Community expend-iture to one twelfth of the lower of the provisions in the 1979 Budget or the1980 Draft Budget and to limitation of the VAT element in monthly contri-butions by Member States.The Customs Union5.28 During May to July considerable progress was made on the legislativeprogramme for the harmonisation of customs procedures. The Counciladopted Regulations on Remissions or Repayments and on the Post ClearanceCollection of Customs Import and Export Duties. The former defines thecircumstances in which duty can be repaid or remitted while the latter sets outthe conditions under which customs administrations can recover duty whichhas been underpaid. Both are due to come into force on 1 July 1980.5.29 An important Directive harmonising the procedures for the releaseof goods for free circulation in the Community was also adopted and is duefor implementation on 1 July 1981, provided that Community rules definingwho may enter goods for customs purposes have been established before thatdate. The Council also adopted a Directive on &quot;Customs Debt&quot; to come intoforce on 1 January 1982. This establishes, on a Community basis, the exactpoint in time when customs become liable for payment in variouscircumstances.5.30 Two further Regulations adopted in May implemented in the Com-munity the Nairobi Protocol to the UNESCO (Florence) Agreement on theduty-free importation of educational, scientific and cultural materials.Taxation5.31 On 16 October the Fiscal Council agreed to proposals to extend theexisting Mutual Assistance and Mutual Recovery Directives to value addedtax, and to adopt the 8th VAT Directive which lays down arrangements forrefunding VAT to taxable persons from another Member State. The Councilalso considered revised proposals to harmonise the structure (but not therates) of excise duties on alcoholic drinks, but having failed to reach agree-ment, referred the proposal for further consideration.Export Credits5.32 The export credit guidelines were reviewed by all participants (allmembers of the OECD except Turkey and Iceland) in May. As a result of19
regular reviews in June and December the Council agreed that the Communitywould continue to apply the unmodified guidelines. The guidelines govern theextension of officially supported credits in terms of two years or more in orderto contain destructive competition on credit terms between credit supplyingcountries.Capital Movements5.33 United Kingdom exchange controls have been completely abolished.On 12 June, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his BudgetStatement a number of relaxations of the controls and said that he intendedto take further steps in their progressive dismantling. Further liberalisationmeasures were announced on 18 July. These included the removal of restric-tions on the financing of portfolio investment in most securities denominatedand payable solely in other Community currencies and in all quoted securitiesissued by Community institutions, and of restrictions on the financing ofoutward direct investment. On 23 October the Chancellor announced theabolition of all the remaining controls, except those in relation to Rhodesia,which were subsequently lifted as from 13 December.5.34 As a result of the abolition of exchange controls, the United Kingdomis meeting in full its obligations under the Treaty of Rome and the CapitalMovements Directives.Banking5.35 Article II of the co-ordination Directive concerning credit institutions(77/780/EEC) provides for the establishment of an Advisory Committee whoserole is to monitor developments resulting from the implementation of theDirective and to propose further measures for the greater co-ordination ofCommunity banking policies. The Committee held its first meeting on 19 Juneand was attended by representatives of the supervisory authorities and policymakers of the Nine.Section VI:  Regional and Industrial AffairsEuropean Coal and Steel Community (ECSC): Loans6.1 Loans totalling  5.4m were paid to United Kingdom companies forprojects creating employment opportunities for ex-steel and coal workersunder Article 56 of the Treaty of Paris. Further loans are under negotiation.The United Kingdom Government provided guarantees against possible lossor currency fluctuations over the period of the loans for projects in the AssistedAreas.European Regional Development Fund6.2 Amendments to the Regulation governing the administration of theFund were approved by the Council in June 1978, but were subsequentlysubject to the conciliation procedure with the European Parliament. This wassatisfactorily concluded early in 1979. The amended Regulation, published9 February, makes provision for 5 per cent of the Fund to be used outside20
national quotas, in accordance with specific regional development measureswhich will be determined by the Council following proposals by the Commis-sion and after consulting the European Parliament. Proposals for the first fivesuch measures were considered by the Foreign Affairs Council on 18 Decem-ber and were referred back for further consideration. The United Kingdom&apos;sobjections were that the United Kingdom&apos;s share was inadequate, that addi-tional United Kingdom areas should benefit and that too little money wasgoing to poorer Members and industrial areas.6.3 The amount of the Fund for 1979 was not agreed in 1978 because ofdisagreement between the European Parliament and the Council about theBudget for 1979. The final agreement between the Parliament and the Councilprovided for a Fund of 945 MEUA (about  614 million)(l), including 5 percent (47.25 MEUA (about  31 million)(l)) for the non-quota section.6.4 In their Budget proposals for 1980, the Commission included provisionfor 1,200 MEUA (about  779 million)(l) for the Fund, but the Budget Councilon 11 September agreed on a smaller figure of 850 MEUA (about  552million)(l).On 20 November the Budget Council, taking into account theviews of the European Parliament, increased the figure to 1015 MEUA (about 659 million)(l). The latter figure was referred for consideration to theEuropean Parliament but in December the European Parliament rejected thewhole of the proposed budget.Review of Regional Aids by the Commission6.5 The United Kingdom continued to supply the Commission with statis-tical data, and with information on United Kingdom regional aids, as part ofthe Commission&apos;s review of Member States&apos; systems of regional aids. Fulldetails of the changes in the United Kingdom regional policy have beennotified to the Commission. It is expected that the review will be completedin 1980.European Investment Bank (EIB): Loans6.6 Under the previous Government a scheme was introduced wherebyprivate sector manufacturing industry in the Assisted Areas could take advan-tage of attractive foreign currency loans from the EIB with the Governmentcovering them against the exchange risk. Loans totalling  62 million were paidduring the year to United Kingdom private sector investment projects in theAssisted Areas and further loans are under negotiation. A further  381.5million was lent by the Bank for public sector projects in the United Kingdom.The borrowers included the Electricity Council, National Water Authorityand Local Authorities.Science and Technology6.7 On 19 March Council approval was given to an Agreement underwhich non-Community members of European Co-operation in Science andTechnology (COST) could become associated with the Community researchprogramme on the treatment and use of sewage sludge. This Agreement was(1) Converted at late December market rate of 1.54 eua21=  1.
subsequently signed on 26 July on behalf of the Community and five non-member countries Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.Relevant research in these countries will now be concerted with the Com-munity programme.6.8 On 27 March the Energy Council adopted two small indirect researchprogrammes in the field of nuclear energy. One concerns the decommissioningof nuclear power stations and the other covers the safety of light waterreactors.6.9 The Scientific and Technical Research Committee (CREST) met on24 April in the first of a series of meetings to compare the scientific andtechnological research policies of the Community and the Member States. Thecomparisons will guide the Commission in presenting future proposals forresearch.6.10 On 24 July Council approval was given to an Agreement between theCommunity and Greece for Greek participation in a concerted action projectin the field of registration of congenital abnormalities. This is one of theprojects included in the first conceited action programme in medical andpublic health research adopted by the Council in February 1978.6.11 On 16 August Council agreement was given to the extension of theCommunity network for data transmission (Euronet) to Switzerland.6.12 On 11 September Council approval was given to a research pro-gramme which follows one which expired on 30 June, in the fields of energyconservation and alternative energy sources, and allocated Communityexpenditure of 105 MEUA (about  68 million)(l)over a four-year period. Aswell as research into energy conservation the programme covers aspects ofsolar energy, geothermal energy, the use and production of hydrogen as anenergy vector and energy systems modelling.6.13 On 9 October the Council agreed to a realignment of priorities withinthe present five year Community environment research programme includinga considerably increased emphasis on the measurement of sea-water qualityand the effects of pollutants on marine life. An increase of funding from 16 to20.8 MEUA (from about  10 million to  14 million)(l) was approved. TheCouncil also agreed to the continuation of work in the field of standardreference materials and methods. The Community Reference Bureau willcontinue to develop the range of standard reference materials available andwill set up formalised arrangements for the proper storage and distribution ofsuch materials. Work will also be undertaken into aspects of appliedmetrology.6.14 On 22 October a Council of Research Ministers met for the first timesince 1977. The Council endorsed the continuation of the development of thecommon policy for science and technology through the co-ordination ofMember States&apos; national research policies and the joint implementation ofCommunity research programmes; but Community research activities should(1) Converted at the late December market rate of 1.54 eua =  1.22
be defined to take account of Member States&apos; research policies and Communitypolicies in other sectors. The Council identified as priority sectors for themedium term energy and raw materials, environment, agriculture and certainindustrial research and development. The Council also asked the Commissionto make proposals for improving the effectiveness of research programmesincluding the evaluation and utilisation of results.6.15 The Council adopted two Community research projects. One, con-cerned with the exchange of information on the effects of thermal processingon the nutritive value of foodstuffs, is based on the co-ordination of MemberStates research at Community level. The Community will fund co-ordinationcosts up to 287,000 EUA (about  186,000)(1) for a three year period. It isintended that the project will be open to participation by non-Member States.The other research programme is directed at the management of radioactivewaste. Community expenditure of 43 MEUA (about  28 million)(l) has beenallocated over a five year period.6.16 On 12 November the Foreign Affairs Council approved a five yearresearch programme on the recycling of urban and industrial waste. Theprogramme includes the sorting of household waste, thermal treatment ofwaste, fermentation and hydrolisis and the recovery of rubber waste. Part ofthe programme will be implemented by means of contracts placed in MemberStates and part will consist of an exchange of information arising from nationalprogrammes. The Community will contribute 9 MEUA (about  6 million)(l)over 4 years.6.17 On 18 December the Council adopted a five year research programmeinto climatology and Community expenditure of 8 MEUA (about  5million)(l) has been allocated. The areas of study will include past and futureclimates, the impact of climatic variability on European resources and Man&apos;simpact on the climate. The Council also approved three Agreements withnon-Community COST countries, along the same lines as that approved inMarch (paragraph 6.7). The new Agreements relate to the Communityresearch programmes on the processing of foodstuffs, and aquatic and atmos-pheric pollutants. These Agreements have not yet been signed.6.18 The programme of the Community Joint Research Centre (JRC) andthe Community fusion programme were both considered at the 22 Octoberand 20 December meetings of the Research Council. The JRC conductsresearch in a number of areas including nuclear safety, renewable energysources and environmental studies. The Community programme in the fieldof thermonuclear fusion comprises both the research carried out in laboratories &apos;in Member States and also the Joint European Torus (JET) which is underconstruction at Culham in Oxfordshire. Although progress was made towardsreaching agreement on the two programmes some points of disagreementremain and no final decision was reached.6.19 The December Research Council also reached broad agreement onrolling forward the programme on radiation protection to the end of 1984.This programme, which is carried out by means of partially funded contracts(1) Converted at the late December market rate of 1.54 eua =  1.23
with research institutions in Member States, is designed to improve knowledgeof the effects of ionising radiation.Steel6.20 The United Kingdom steel industry continued to derive benefit fromthe Commission&apos;s anti-crisis measures. While recognising that such measurescan only be temporary, the Government welcome the decision of the Councilon 18 December to renew these measures with some modifications for afurther year, particularly in view of the poor prospects for steel demand in1980 and the extensive restructuring being undertaken in the United Kingdom.The package comprises measures to lift prices to a more economic level,guidance on deliveries within the Community market and agreements withdie major steel exporting countries outside the Community covering the pricesand volumes of their sales to the Community.6.21 The Commission continues to be engaged on its longer-term forecastsof steel demand and supply which form the basis of criteria for restructuringthe Community steel industry.6.22 The Foreign Affairs Council reached agreement in principle on18 September over the terms of a decision setting out general rules for specificgovernment aid for steel undertakings, in December the last formal reserveby a Member State was lifted and the Decision is now in force.Textiles and ClothingSynthetic Fibres6.23 Against the background of serious excess capacity in Communityindustry the Commission are continuing their discussions with Communityproducers (excluding those who are subsidiaries of firms outside the Com-munity) to find means of bringing capacity into equilibrium with demand in amanner compatible with the provisions of the Treaty of Rome. In June theCommission also asked Member States to continue for a further two years(subject to review after one year) to refrain from giving aids towards thecreation of additional synthetic fibre capacity, and to notify the Commissionin advance of any aids towards existing capacity; the Government expressedtheir support for the underlying objectives of this report.6.24 On 20 December the Council introduced a Regulation for aid up to14 MEUA (about  9 million)(l) to be made available from Community fundsto assist industrial restructuring and conversion operations in the Communityman-made fibres industry.United States Competition in certain Man-Made Fibre Products6.25 In April the Foreign Affairs Council agreed to adopt appropriatemeasures under the GATT if world synthetic fibre producers took advantageof artificial differences in energy and feedstock prices to disrupt, or threatento disrupt, the Community market for textiles.(1) Converted at the late December market rate of 1.54 eua= l.24
6.26 Since then there has been a sharp rise in imports of certain man-madefibre products from the United States of America. The Commission, whichset up a Working Group in which the United Kingdom have played an activerole, concluded that United States synthetic fibre producers gain a competitiveadvantage as a result of United States Government controls on the price of oiland natural gas.6.27 The Government have been pressing for an early solution to be foundto the problem of growing imports from the United States. The Commissionhave been requested to put recommendations for dealing with the problem tothe meeting of the Council of Ministers on 4/5 February 1980.A Community Industry Policy for Textiles and Clothing generally6.28 In line with their communication to the Council in July 1978 ongeneral guidelines for a textiles and clothing industry policy, the Commissionput forward to the Council in April a proposal for a second Communityresearch and development programme in the field of textiles and clothing. TheCouncil has yet to take a decision on this proposal. The Commission have alsobeen considering the establishment of a textile information system for theCommunity.Aircraft Construction Industry6.29 Commission activity during the year has largely centred on furtherconsideration of the Community&apos;s future role in this sector.6.30 An initiative has been taken by European trade associations tointerest the Community in a programme of research into the problems asso-ciated with the future management of air traffic in Europe. During mid-1979,several contracts were placed with European firms (Decca in United Kingdom)by the Commission for preliminary study work. Later phases of the work arelikely to be more extensive and to involve Member countries&apos; national researchorganisations. The aeronautical research programme which has been thesubject of discussion within the Community for the past two years is nowthought unlikely to proceed.Shipbuilding6.31 On 25 September the Commission submitted a Communication tothe Council seeking approval in principle to a Community scrap and buildscheme. The Foreign Affairs Council on 20 November reached no decisionand the Commission are now reconsidering the matter. The Government havemade it clear that they will support a scrap and build scheme provided that itis cost-effective.6.32 In October agreement was reached with the Commission on proposalssubmitted by the United Kingdom in accordance with the terms of the 4thShipbuilding Directive for renewal of the Shipbuilding Intervention Fund forthe shipbuilding industry in Great Britain and for an analogous fund for aidto the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Northern Ireland.25
Data Processing6.33 In September the Council adopted a four-year Multiannual Pro-gramme in the field of data processing covering standardisation, public pro-curement, collaboration in research and development, and further studies ofthe sector and its effects on employment. It also makes available financialassistance from Community funds for projects of Community interest con-cerned with the development of general software and of applications of data-processing. The programme is a realistic one and offers good prospects ofachieving its aims of improving data processing in the Community.Company Law6.34 Intensive negotiations took place throughout the period on a draftdirective on group accounts, and work continued on a number of other draftinstruments including directives on prospectuses, collective investment funds(unit trusts), annual accounts of credit institutions, division of companies,conditions of access to the profession of stockbroker, the European CompanyStatute, and Convention on bankruptcy and the mutual recognition of com-panies. A Directive on the disclosure of information by limited companieswas adopted by the Council on 20 December.Insurance6.35 The Directive on life assurance on an establishment basis was formallyadopted by the Council on 5 March. A Working Group began a final readingof the draft directive concerning the sale of non-life insurance across frontiers.Progress has remained slow but the United Kingdom has fully supported theaims of the draft.Industrial Property6.36 Work continued on the steps which will be necessary to implementthe Community Patent Convention. Consideration of the creation of a Com-munity Trade Mark by a Working Group in Brussels has also continued.Commercial Agency6.37 A proposed commercial agency directive is at present being consid-ered by a Council Working Party. The main purposes of the proposal are toharmonise the laws of the Member States relating to commercial agents,differences in which the Commission considers to be detrimental to thefunctioning of the Community, and to strengthen the position of the commer-cial agent who is assumed to be the weaker party in negotiating with hisprincipal.Section VII:  Environment and TransportEnvironmental Issues7.1 The Environment Council met on 9 April for a debate on generalpolicy matters. The occasion provided a useful exchange of views, particularlyon the proposal in the planning field for a system of environmental impact26
assessments for certain projects and the proposal for concluding voluntary&quot;quality of life&quot; agreements with certain sectors of industry.7.2 The Environment Council also met on 19 June and 17 December. Atthe June meeting they were able to agree in principle four proposals. Thefirst, the 6th amendment to the Directive relating to classification, packagingand labelling of dangerous substances, introduced a Community-wide systemfor the notification of new chemical substances being brought onto the market.The other three Directives developed further the Community&apos;s policy onwater quality. These were the protection of ground water against pollution bycertain dangerous substances, improvement of the quality of shellfish waters,and harmonisation of methods of measurement and analysis of surface waterfor abstraction of drinking water.7.3 At the December meeting Ministers agreed in principle two proposals.The first, which had been referred back to officials at the previous Council,was a Directive setting Community wide health protection standards relatingto concentrations of smoke and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere. The secondwas a Decision to reduce by 30 per cent the use within the Community ofcertain chlorofluorocarbons for filling aerosol cans. The Council also consid-ered a proposal to set an air quality standard for lead, but some basic issuesremained unresolved and it was agreed that it should be further considered atofficial level.7.4 The Government put forward a proposal on the conservation ofwhales, which received clear support from other countries. The Commissionare expected to bring forward a proposal on this matter in the near future.Inland Transport7.5 At the 20 February Transport Council discussion took place on theproposal for the recognition and exchange of driving licences in common formwithin the Community; the United Kingdom maintained a general reservationon the grounds that the exchange proposal would jeopardise the UnitedKingdom&apos;s high standards for testing and licensing drivers of public servicesand heavy goods vehicles. Discussions on possible means of resolving thisdifficulty are continuing.7.6 The 6 December Transport Council agreed a package of road haulageproposals. The most important to the United Kingdom increased the Com-munity quota of permits by 20 per cent. Others included a Regulation to allowshort-term Community permits, a Directive liberalising own account roadfreight transport and a Decision on bilateral quota negotiations. The Counciltook note of two Commission reports, ie the second biennial report on theeconomic and financial state of the railways and a report on railway integration,and heard Commission statements on transport infrastructure, railways andother matters.7.7 On 7 February, the European Court of Justice declared that by notadopting in good time measures to implement Regulation No. 1463/70 on theintroduction of recording equipment (tachographs) in road transport, the27
United Kingdom Government had failed to fulfil their obligations under theTreaty of Rome. The present Government, after consulting the Commissionand other interested parties made implementing regulations which Parliamentapproved in December.Shipping7.8 The Transport Council reached agreement in February on the basisfor a Council Regulation embodying a common Community approach to theUnited Nations Convention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences. TheRegulation was formally adopted on 15 May. It opens the way for MemberStates to become Contracting Parties to the Convention, subject to certainreservations. These are designed to ensure compatibility with the provisionsof the Treaty of Rome on right of establishment and to preserve a commerciallycompetitive regime for conferences serving intra-OECD trades. There arealso specific arrangements to preserve competition among Community andOECD lines in trades serving non-OECD countries. The developing countrieswill gain the full benefits of the Code in their trades with the Community.The Community position was well received by the developing countries atUNCTAD V.7.9 The Community continued to discuss possible measures on maritimesafety and pollution.Civil Aviation7.10 On 6 December the Transport Council agreed to the Commission&apos;sdraft directive on aircraft noise; and the Directive was formally adopted on 20December. The Directive requires Member States to enforce minimum aircraftnoise standards specified by the International Civil Aviation Authority(ICAO) and the relevant recommendations of the European Civil AviationConference (ECAC).7.11 In July the Commission produced a discussion document entitled&quot;Contribution of the European Communities to the Development of AirTransport Services&quot;. The Transport Council took note of the document attheir 6 December meeting and invited the Commission to pursue in the firstinstance the scope for encouraging the development of services across nationalborders to serve the regions. The Commission have been invited to submitspecific proposals for action to the Council in the first half of 1980. The Councilalso adopted a Decision on a consultation procedure for air transport questionswhich may arise in international organisations or in relation to the functioningof bilateral or multilateral agreements.7.12 Final agreement for Community observers to be present at the ECACworking level meetings is likely to be signed in January 1980.28
Section VIII:   Social AffairsEmployment8.1 Employment Ministers met informally in Paris on 9/10 March. Theydiscussed the feasibility and likely effectiveness of reducing working time asa means of increasing employment opportunities. They also considered howprocedures at future Tripartite Conferences between Ministers, Unions andEmployers could be improved to make these periodic meetings more worth-while for all the participants. There was also a brief discussion on the arrange-ments for worker participation in the Member States.8.2 The Labour and Social Affairs Council met on IS May. The Councildiscussed the Commission&apos;s proposed approach to the concept of work-shar-ing. They stressed that this should take into account the internal and externalcompetitiveness of the Community and would require the co-operation ofboth sides of industry at a national and Community level. It was agreed thatthe Commission would do further preparatory work in this area and whereappropriate make proposals. Agreement was reached on the substance of adirective to protect employees in the event of the insolvency of their employersand on a Decision setting up a joint programme to encourage the exchange ofyoung workers.8.3 The Standing Committee on Employment (comprising representativesof employers and workers as well as Employment Ministers and the Commis-sion) met on 22 May to discuss the problems of achieving a balance of supplyand demand on the labour market and the future consultative relationshipbetween the parties at Tripartite Conferences. On hearing from the Presidencyan account of the Social Affairs Council of IS May the European Trade UnionConfederation (ETUC) called for a revision of the Council Conclusions onwork-sharing and after discussion withdrew from the meeting. The discussionon the labour market was postponed.8.4 Employment Ministers met informally in Dublin on 20/21 September.They discussed the employment situation in the light of the increased cost ofenergy and the possibilities for work-sharing.8.5 The Standing Committee on Employment met on 9 October for thepostponed discussion of current problems in the way of achieving balancedsupply and demand on the labour market. The Committee recognised thatmany factors were involved. While renewed economic growth was the mainrequirement for the re-establishment of high levels of employment, attentionneeded to be given to a number of areas of employment policy. These includedthe importance of developing vocational guidance and training measures; theneed to make full use of the placement and other assistance available throughthe public employment services and the desirability of developing a greaterdegree of employee participation in decision making affecting workingconditions.8.6 The Labour and Social Affairs Council met on 22 November. Themain item discussed was the draft resolution on the reorganisation of working29
time, submitted by the Commission following the consultations carried outduring the course of the year. In agreeing the Resolution, the Councilconsidered that limits should be applied to systematic overtime working,provided that these took account of such factors as the necessary flexibility ofthe production process and the situation in the labour market and wereintroduced in accordance with procedures in force in Member States. TheResolution also invites the Commission to consider further the possibility ofa Community approach to the questions of flexible retirement, part-timework, temporary work and reducing annual hours of work. The effect of theResolution in the United Kingdom is that the possible introduction of work-sharing measures is a matter for unions and managements to consider in thecourse of collective bargaining procedures. The Council also agreed a Reso-lution to encourage systems of training, based on alternating periods ofemployment with educational or training activity, with the intention of assist-ing the transition from school to work and in general breaking down thebarriers between education/training and employment.8.7 The Council also adopted conclusions agreeing to a proposal from theCommission to promote consultation between the Member States on migrationpolicies towards third countries. The Council took note of the Commission&apos;sseventh report on the European Social Fund and referred for further exami-nation the Commission&apos;s communication on employee participation in assetformation, which the United Kingdom welcomed as a useful basis for discus-sion and in accord with the Government&apos;s policy of encouraging wide own-ership of real and financial property.European Social Fund8.8 Allocations for United Kingdom projects from the 1978 commitmentsbudget totalled  75 million. Allocations to the United Kingdom from the 1979commitments budget amount to some  130 million.Rights of Establishment8.9 Directives on the mutual recognition between Member States ofqualifications of midwives were agreed at the Foreign Affairs Council on 18December. The Government favour further progress with the removal ofbarriers to free movement of workers in order to offer wider employmentopportunities for Community citizens. It is hoped that agreement can bereached for architects, on which work continued throughout the period, andfor other professions, including accountants and financial advisers, for whichthere are Commission proposals also under consideration.Social Security8.10 The Labour and Social Affairs Council in May considered the Com-mission&apos;s proposals for the adaptation of the Council Regulations on theapplication of social security schemes to employed persons and their familiesmoving within the Community to extend it to self-employed persons and theirfamilies, and insured non-employed persons. The proposals, which are largelythe result of United Kingdom initiative, were welcomed by the majority.Reservations on the use of Article 235 of the Treaty to extend the Regulation30
to the non-employed and on the procedure for payment of family benefitsproved intractable and agreement could not be reached. Discussion continuedat the November Labour and Social Affairs Council.Education8.11 Further progress was made in the Education Committee in Brusselsin implementing the Resolutions of February and December 1976, and indeveloping proposals on modern languages, European studies, student mobil-ity and equal opportunities for girls in education.8.12 United Kingdom applicants continued to receive a good share of thegrants which are being financed under the education co-operation pro-grammes. For 1979/80 United Kingdom participants were allocated about 100grants for study visits and British institutions of higher education figured in 48out of 74 successful schemes for the development of joint study courses. Thenew edition of the Handbook for Students was published and widely distrib-uted to institutions of higher education and local education authorities in theUnited Kingdom.Section IX: Energy9.1 The 27 March Energy Council discussed the approach to energy policyin the Community, and recognised the primary role of national programmes.Discussion continued of the international oil situation, following the 12-13March European Council. Further work was commissioned on Communitycoal support. The Council approved financial provision to support demonstra-tion projects in energy saving and alternative energies, and the frameworkand first implementing directives on the energy consumption labelling ofdomestic appliances.9.2 On 17 May the Council discussed the serious oil supply situation andits economic consequences. The Council considered a Commission report onmeasures implemented or worked out by Member States to reduce oil andpetroleum product consumption in 1979. They also stressed the importance ofadditional voluntary efforts, and looked for similar action from other industrialcountries. The Council examined and approved Commission proposals toimprove the information available on the quantities of oil and petroleumproducts imported into the Community, and on their prices, and took note ofCommission arrangements to resume monitoring of the spot market from1 June. The Council agreed the detailed implementation of Communityarrangements for licensing exports of crude oil and petroleum products fromone Member State to another in an emergency.9.3 The 18 June Council discussed the current oil situation in preparationfor the Strasbourg European Council on 21-22 June and the 28-29 June TokyoSummit. Member States reaffirmed their readiness to study whatever addi-tional oil demand restraint measures were necessary, and to keep the possi-bility of further action under close review. The Council invited the Commissionto discuss with oil companies the improvement of market information by the31
inclusion of crude oil as well as petroleum products in the Rotterdam CheckRun. They also agreed to consider other possibilities for improving markettransparency.9.4 The 20 September Council held an exchange of views on recentdevelopments in the energy situation and outlook. The Council discussed thedistribution among Member States of the common target for oil imports in1985 in preparation for the meeting of Summit Energy Ministers in Paris on26 September. The Council also discussed detailed arrangements for register-ing imports of crude oil into the Community, and considered the role of theInternational Energy Technology Group to be set up following the TokyoSummit in June.9.5 The 9 October Council reaffirmed Member States&apos; national oil importtargets for 1985, and discussed the disaggregation of the Community globaltarget of 472 million tonnes oil imports for 1980. There was agreement onmany outstanding points of detail on the proposed Regulation to establish aregister of oil imports. The Council discussed the Presidency&apos;s suggestions onCommunity support for coal, together with Mr Howell&apos;s letter to Commis-sioner Brunner and Energy Ministers, suggesting a scheme of  160 million perannum to assist coal production investment. There was general discussion ofproposals for Community energy objectives for 1990, for new lines of actionin energy savings, and for support for hydrocarbon exploration projects. TheCouncil approved the allocation of funds for Phase 1 of Round 5 of the schemeto support Community projects in the hydrocarbons sector.9.6 On 4 December the Energy Council considered a proposal, subse-quently adopted by the Council on 18 December, to extend for two years theCommunity&apos;s existing scheme to support intra-Community trade in cokingcoal, on the basis that the higher support level would be funded largely by theoriginal six Member States. Agreement in principle was reached on the figuresproposed for the breakdown into national targets of the Community&apos;s net oilimport objective, agreed in Strasbourg, of 472 million tonnes in 1980. TheCouncil also agreed the principles of arrangements for monitoring the ade-quacy of national policies to achieve oil import targets.Nuclear Co-operation9.7 The discussions in Council Working Groups on two negotiating man-dates begun in 1978, continued into 1979. The first mandate provided fornuclear co-operation between Australia and the Community, and the secondenabled the Commission to participate on behalf of the Community in thedrawing up of a draft convention on the physical protection of nuclearmaterials.9.8 Both negotiating mandates were adopted at the Foreign Affairs Coun-cil on 18 September. The convention on physical protection, which has beendrawn up under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency, toucheson matters which are within the competence both of the Community and ofMember States. Member States individually participated in the drawing up ofthe convention in so far as matters within their competence are concerned.32
9.9 The Council discussed a Commission paper on the operation of Chap-ter VI of the Euratom Treaty concerned with the supply of nuclear materials.This gives the Supply Agency, under the Commission, a monopoly role inconcluding contracts for uranium and nuclear fuel requirements from outsidethe Community, and a right of option on all fuel produced within the Com-munity. These powers have been exercised largely in token ways but havecreated uncertainty about the legal framework for nuclear fuel supplies. Alsobefore the Council was a French paper formally requesting a revision ofChapter VI, with ideas for a common supply policy. The Commission under-took to examine the French request, with the advice of a group of expertsfrom Member States and to report back to the Council.9.10 The Government welcome the fact that the Community can nowproceed to negotiate a nuclear co-operation agreement with Australia. Abilateral safeguards agreement between the United Kingdom and Australiawas signed in July after discussion with the Commission under the procedurelaid down in Article 103 of the Euratom Treaty. The provisions of thisagreement will be superseded as appropriate when a Euratom/Australiaagreement is concluded.9.11 The Government are also pleased that there is to be further discussionon the legal framework for nuclear fuel in the Community. In their view, thisshould be beneficial in creating a clear and realistic basis of operation for thenuclear industry in the Community.Section X:  Consumer Affairs10.1 On 27 June the Commission forwarded to the Council a draft con-sumer action programme which follows up the preliminary four-year pro-gramme established by a Council Resolution of 14 April. The Governmentbelieve that the Community can and should make a valuable contribution tothe protection of consumers throughout the Community and therefore wel-come the Commission&apos;s initiative in proposing a further consumer actionprogramme. The Government share the Commission&apos;s view that consumerinterests are best served by an appropriate combination of national andCommunity action.Unit Pricing10.2 On 19 June Council approval was given to the first two measuresunder the preliminary programme for a consumer protection and informationpolicy agreed in 1975: they are designed to facilitate price comparisons atretail sale. A Directive on the indication of prices of foodstuffs lays down therules for indicating both the selling price and the price per unit of measure-ment, where appropriate, and has to be implemented by June 1981. Anaccompanying Resolution is designed to encourage the adoption by nationalgovernments of prescribed ranges of simply-related sizes for pre-packagedgoods which should automatically qualify for exemption from unit pricing andprovides for review in 1983.33
Units of Measurement10.3 In December the Council adopted a new amending Directiye on theapproximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measure-ment, to replace earlier Directives. The principal United Kingdom interest isin the timetable for phasing out remaining imperial units in favour of acommon Community system of metric units. Effectively the Directive post-pones the need to take any decision for 10 years and the programmeof metrication remains essentially a matter for the United KingdomGovernment.Section XI:  The Institutions of the CommunityCommission Review Body11.1 On 24 September the Commission Review Body, chaired by Ambas-sador Spierenburg, presented its report to the Commission. The five-mangroup was set up by the Commission in late 1978 to examine inter alia theorganisation, staff structure and staffing policies of the Commission and itsservices in the context of enlargement. In the first instance it is for theCommission to indicate what follow-up action it intends to take.Committee of Three11.2 The Report of the Committee of Three (&quot;Three Wise Men&quot;) on theInstitutions of the Community was submitted to the European Council inNovember, in discharge of the mandate given to them by the EuropeanCouncil in December 1978. The Report was remitted to Foreign Ministers forstudy and copies have been sent to the Presidents of the other Institutions forinformation. The European Council will discuss the Report at its next meeting.The European ParliamentDirect Elections11.3 The first direct elections were held throughout the Community on7-10 June; in the United Kingdom on 7 June. The election was conducted bythe simple majority system of voting in Great Britain and by the singletransferable vote system of proportional representation in Northern Ireland.11.4 Following a by-election on 20 September, made necessary by theelection on 7 June of a candidate while disqualified, there are now 60 EuropeanDemocrats, 17 Labour, 1 Scottish Nationalist, 1 Ulster Unionist, 1 SocialDemocrat and Labour Party and 1 Democratic Unionist Party representativesfrom the United Kingdom in the European Parliament, out of a total of 410members.Emoluments for Directly-Elected Members of the European Parliament11.5 In accordance with the agreement earlier reached between MemberStates that each State should be responsible for the salaries of its representa-tives, the United Kingdom enacted legislation on 26 July to provide itsrepresentatives in the European Parliament with the same salaries and pension34
entitlements as their national counterparts. Representatives who are alsoMembers of the House of Commons receive an abated salary.European Court of Justice11.6 The number of cases brought before the Court has continued toincrease, and the Court submitted to the Council two sets of proposalsdesigned to alleviate its workload. The first paper proposed an increase in thenumber of Judges and Advocates-General, while the second paper in additionproposed amendments to the Rules of Procedure of the Court which would,among other things, allow a greater number of cases to be heard by a Chamberof the Court rather than the full Court. The first proposal is still underdiscussion but amendments to the Rules of Procedure were approved by theCouncil in July and adopted by the Court on 12 September. Some of theseamendments go some way towards meeting proposals made by the UnitedKingdom in a note submitted to the Council of Ministers of Justice in October1978; the Court has also agreed to changes in its practice which will removesome of the constraints on interventions in cases by Member States.11.7 During 1979 United Kingdom courts have referred 8 cases to theEuropean Court for preliminary ruling, one of which was subsequently with-drawn. One of these cases was the first reference from the House of Lords.The Government have submitted observations in 3 of these cases, and inaddition have submitted observations in 6 cases referred for preliminary rulingby Courts of other Member States. The Government also have intervened ina direct action brought against the Commission concerning plant breeders&apos;rights.11.8 At the beginning of 1979 there were pending before the Court threesets of proceedings brought by the Commission alleging infringement of treatyobligations by the United Kingdom. The Court have given judgment in favourof the Commission in the cases concerning a breach of Article 30 of the EECTreaty because of a ban on potato imports (paragraph 4.12) and a failure toimplement the Regulation requiring the compulsory installation of tacho-graphs in goods vehicles (paragraph 7.7). Judgment is still awaited in a thirdcase alleging a breach of Article 95 of the Treaty because wine is taxed morehighly than beer.11.9 The Commission brought two sets of proceedings against the UnitedKingdom alleging that fisheries measures adopted unilaterally by the UnitedKingdom are in breach of treaty obligations (see para. 4.23). In anotherfishery case about mesh sizes, brought by France against the United Kingdomin 1978, the Court has ruled in favour of France.Meeting of Community Ministers of the Interior11.10 The fourth conference of Ministers of the Interior of the EuropeanCommunity and Ministers of Justice with similar responsibilities was held inDublin on 23 October to strengthen co-operation against terrorism and otherserious crime (Ministers of Justice subsequently signed an Agreement on 4December, see paragraph 2.10). Ministers welcomed the improvements in co-operation between Member States which have already taken place; took note35
of work in progress and exchanges under way, and approved a programme ofwork aimed at further extending practical collaboration among MemberStates.Section XII: Parliament12.1 Parliament was in session for 11 weeks during the period 1 Januaryto 3 May. During that time the House of Commons Scrutiny Committeeconsidered 182 Community documents, and recommended 33 of these forfurther consideration by the House. The House of Lords Scrutiny Committeeconsidered 189 documents in this period of which 6 were recommended fordebate. Debates on 13 documents were held in the House of Commons andon 2 in the House of Lords.12.2 Following the opening of the new Parliament on 15 May the scrutinyof Community documents was resumed by the House of Commons SelectCommittee on European Legislation etc which was appointed on 2 July andthe House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communitiesappointed on 22 May. Parliament was in session for 18 weeks during theperiod 3 May to 31 December. During that time the House of CommonsScrutiny Committee considered 456 Community documents and recom-mended 51 of these for further consideration by the House. The House ofLords Scrutiny Committee considered 420 documents in this period, of which12 were recommended for debate. Debates on 17 documents were held in theHouse of Commons and on 15 in the House of Lords.36
