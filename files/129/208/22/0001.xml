CONFIDENTIAL3CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80)22 COPY NO g214 March 1980CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMMEMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and theActing Leader of the House of Lords1. Our legislative programme is making steady progress.    We haveintroduced 40 Bills (excluding Finance and Consolidation Bills), of which 20will have received Royal Assent by Easter.    We foresee no major problemsin the Commons although guillotines will be necessary to secure the HousingBill, the Loral Government (Planning and Land) (No 2) Bill and the SocialSecurity (No 2) Bill.    The timetable in the House of Lords is, however,seriously congested.    This memorandum proposes how we might now proceed.2. It seems to us wrong in principle to introduce any further Bill withouta reasonable assurance that it will reach Poyal Assent,    To do so adds weightto unsubtantiated allegations that we have not planned the programme properly.The time of the House of Lords will be fully occupied by Bills already intro-duced and by the Social Security (No 2) Bill.    We can add to the programmeonly Bills dealing with financial matters which will not take time in the Lords.Apart from the Finance Bill, they would be:Coal Industry BillPort of London (Financial Assistance) Billand if, but only if, restricted to financial provisions and approved byLegislation Committee:Energy Conservation BillFilms BillWe would, if colleagues agree, be ready to accept a one-clause Bill on theFinances of the White Fish Authority which we are assured is not contro-versial.3. We recognise the arguments put by the Lord Chancellor for adding theContempt of Court Bill to the programme but we do not believe time can befound for its passage.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. If these proposals are agreed the House of Lords will still have to dealwith nine major Bills that are currently before the Commons and with theSocial Security (No 2) Bill.    Cabinet has previously envisaged that Parliamentwould rise for the Summer Recess not later than 8 August.    On this basis itshould be possible to secure the passage of six or seven of the major Bills,leaving three or four to be dealt with in October.    Colleagues should note thatthe House of Commons cannot rise for the Summer Recess before the Lords.Time has to be allowed for Commons consideration of any Lords amendmentsand for Royal Assent.    It is important, therefore, that the number ofGovernment amendments tabled to Bills in the House of Lords be kept to theminimum.5. In r&lt; sponse to our minutes to the Prime Minister of 19 and 29 Februarya number of colleagues have claimed priority in the timetable for particularBills.    All of these claims, which are summarised in Annex A, have realmerits but they cannot all be accommodated.    We need tc establish an order ofpriority which has regard to the relative political importance of the variousmeasures and the financial penalties of their not becoming law by the SummerRecess.    We must also take account of the length of the Bills and the progressthey have already made.    It is desirable that the Housing Bill and the Tenants&apos;Rights (Scotland) Bill, both of which confer on council tenants the right topurchase their houses, should become law at about the same time. TheMinisters responsible in the Lords for the Housing Bill would also beresponsible for the Local Government (Planning and Land) (No 2) Bill so thesetwo measures cannot proceed concurrently.    Finally, there are operationalreasons, summarised in Annex A, pointing to the early enactment of bothSocial Security Bills and of the Broadcasting Bill.6. Bearing all these points in mind, we suggest for the Cabinet&apos;sconsideration that one possible order of priority for securing Royal Assentfor the Bills concerned would be as follows:To be secured before the Summer Recess:Social SecuritySocial Security (No 2)TransportEmployment( Housing( Tenants&apos; Rights (Scotland)BroadcastingTo be secured in the spillover:Local Government (Planning and Land) (No 2)Health ServicesCivil Aviation2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL7. The disadvantages of this timetable from the point of view of the HealthServices Bill are set out in the Annex.    The Secretary of State for theEnvironment is prepared to acquiesce in the Local Government (Planning andLand) (No 2) Bill not becoming law until the spillover.    The controversialprovisions of that Bill, especially as regards the block grant, would howeverthen fall for discussion in the House of Lords at about the time of the PartyConference.    We must draw the attention of colleagues, in the light of theGovernment defeat in the Lords over the transport provisions of theEducation Bill, to the likelihood that the risks of Government defeats overprovisions in the Local Government Bill have been materially increased, andthis timing would increase them still further.8. An alternative order of priorities, which would involve deferring theHousing Bill and the Tenants&apos; Rights (Scotland) Bill to the spillover, would be:To be secured before the Summer Recess:Social SecuritySocial Security (No 2)TransportEmploymentLocal Government (Planning and Land) (No 2)BroadcastingTo be secured in the spillover:Health ServicesHousingTenants&apos; Rights (Scotland)Civil Aviation9. We shall need to consider nearer the time the exact dates of the SummerRecess and the length of the spillover.    Present indications are, however,that if the Recess starts on 8 August the House of Lords will have to sit for atleast four weeks after returning from the Recess in order to secure theprogramme.10. We invite the Cabinet:1. To note the position summarised in this memorandum.2. To note that time can be found for the Port of London(Financial Assistance), Coal Industry and White Fish Authority Bills.3. To agree that further consideration be given by LegislationCommittee to Energy Conservation and Films Bills if limited to essentialfinancial provisions.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. To agree that the Contempt of Court Bill should not be introduced.5. To consider the alternative orders of priority proposed inparagraphs 6 and 8 above for the major Bills yet to be considered by theHouse of Lords.N St J-SFPrivy Council Office14 March 19804CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALANNEX A1*   Broadcasting BillRoyal Assent by the summer recess is necessary in order to enable newITV contracts to be negotiated and brought into operation on 1 January 1982.New contracts must be signed by 1 January 198l to give contractors one yearto prepare for the provision of programmes after 31 December 198lf whencurrent contracts expire.   The IBA cannot award the new contracts until itsown life has been extended beyond the date of expiry of the present contracts.If Royal Assent is delayed until October, the IBA will not be able tofinalise terms of contracts and will not be able to have realistic interviewsin time for contracts to be awarded before the end of the year.2. Employment BilLEnactment by 10 July is necessary to meet the target of having the Codeson Picketing and the closed shop in force in time for next winter*s payround*   As the first stage in the preparation of these codes, the Secretaryof State is required to consult ACAS*   If he cannot do so before the summerrecess there will be a delay of at least two months in the statutoryconsultation process with industry, and the target will not be met.3. Health Services Bill.The Seoretary of State was obliged by previous legislation to implement on1 January revocations of pay beds,   further revocations are not beingproposed on the understanding that the Bill will be passed quickly. TheGeneral Practitioners* Finance Corporation has already had to cease makingnew loans to General Practitioners;   a back log has built up*   The GPFCis unable to make any new loans at all until the Bill becomes law; andbanks are becoming more difficult about providing bridging finance* TheChairman of the Corporation, at a slightly earlier stage, expressed seriousconcern even about the delay whioh would be involved if the Bill were notenacted by Easter,   Deferment to the autumn would lead to strong protestsand anger from the medical profession.The Bill imposes a statutory obligation on health authorities to observecash limits*   The Secretary of State is relying on the likelihood of earlyRoyal Assent to put pressure on the reinstated Lambeth, Lewisham andSouthwark Area Health Authority to act responsibly in the interim*1
4.   Housing BillThe Environment Secretary has given four main reasons why the Bill shouHhave high priority:&quot;First, there is the political imperative arising from our commitmeiHto give council and New Town tenants the right to buy their homes.That policy was a major factor in our Election success*   Over 5 milmontenants fall within its scope and thousands of them are looking forwardto that promise being fulfilled at the earliest opportunity; indee*in correspondence we receive questions why it has not already been done.Council house prices are continuing to rise and, in our view, areunlikely to fall.   The longer enactment is delayed the greater, theaeforwill be the financial penalty imposed on purchasers*&quot;Farther, public sector receipts of between  12 million and  15 mil]may be lost from the current financial year if enactment were delay^by 3 months*&quot;Secondly, the Bill provides for the abolition of the so-called &quot;ncrule&quot; which prevents authorities from making a surplus on their HousRevenue Accounts* If the Bill is not law by October those authorilaffected by the rule will be unlikely to make an autumn rent increaline with our recommended guideline* The net effect on the publicborrowing requirement could be as high as  20 million this year, anconsequentials for later years*&quot;Thirdly, we must have the new subsidy system in force as from 1 Ap1981 to achieve public expenditure savings*   There is a statutoryobligation on the Secretary of State to consult with the LocalAuthority Associations*   We ought to do that as early as possible totry to marry up the timing of the subsidy determination with the RatSupport Grant decisions announced in November*   Enactment later tthe summer recess would impose an unreasonable timetable on the locauthorities   and they would say so publicly and vigorously*&quot;Fourthly, we need enactment as soon as possible to help private sectenants through the shorthold provisions*&quot;2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5    Social Security BillThe Cabinet has already accepted that this Bill, now well advanced inthe Commons, should become law by 24 May as six-month order books areto be issued during May uprating benefits from 24 November accordingto the provisions of the Bill   anticipating the subsequent upratingorder.6. Social Security (No 2) BillThis Bill also affects the uprating of benefits from 24 November. Aswith the Social Security Bill, order books issued during May will naveto anticipate the subsequent affirmative uprating order.:; The contro-versial nature of this Bill makes it particularly important to have themain legislation as far advanced as possible during May, and finallyapproved thereafter.   Subsequent savings are at stake.The passage of the Bill has to be followed by an affirmative orderrequiring approval in both Houses.   The work connected with uprating hasincreased this year because of radical changes in the supplementary benefitscheme.   The Secretary of State would like to see Royal Assent by the endof June, with an nouter deadline&quot; of mid-July.7. Tenants&apos; Rights. Bto&gt; (Scotland) BillThe arguments are essentially the same as for the Housing Bill.   It wouldbe political very damaging if council house tenants in Scotland did notobtain the right to buy their houses at or before the time that the rightbecame available to tenants in England and Wales.8. Transport BillThe Bill, which will be ready for introduction in the Lords before Easter,gives effect to manifesto commitments on the sale of the NFC and reform ofbus licensing.   The Bill needs early enactment because of its pensionsprovisions, which are intended to secure public expenditure savings of 80 million (1979 survey prices) over 1979-80, in 1980-81 and in lateryears.   If the Bill is not enacted by 30 June there will be a short-fallof around  20 million in 1980-81.3CONFIDENTIAL
