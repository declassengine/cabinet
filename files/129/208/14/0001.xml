CONFIDENTIALUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 14 COPY NO 8325 February 1980CABINETCASH LIMITS 1980-81Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. In order to reach conclusions on the size and shape of my Budget,and to publish the Estimates, I need to settle the cash provision we makefor all cash limited public expenditure.    We have taken decisions in mostareas and need now to confirm them in the light of recent developments andof the economic prospect.    But we still have to take one important decisionin the area of Civil Service pay.2. Cash limited expenditure has five separate components:1. The Rate Support Grant (RSG) on local authorities currentexpenditure, in which provision for pay and price increases wasset at 13 per cent. ix } h2. The nationalised industries&apos; external finance limits, wherethe provisions for implicit pay and price increases varied betweenindustries, but, on average, were of about 14 per cent.3. The current expenditure of the central Government otherthan pay, for which we have set provision for price increases of14 per cent, and the capital expenditure of central Government andlocal authorities for which the provision is somewhat higher.4. The pay in central Government other than the Civil Service(principally the National Health Service), for which we have alsoprovided for an increase of 14 per cent; and5. the Civil Service pay element for which we have yet to fixthe provision for an increase.It is of high importance that we should not take action which would precipitatereopening 1. and 2.    Nor do I see any need for us to do so if the cashprovision for local authorities and nationalised industries is marginally lessthan is required.    They are both able to increase income at their own1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALdiscretion: rate increases in the case of local auth oriti.es and priceincreases in the case of nationalised industries.    Categories 3., 4. and 5.however have only one source of income.   Any shortfall in cash provisionhere necessarily entails a volume cut.3. I have not yet formed a final view on the forecast of inflation to bepublished at the time of the Budget.    There is bound to be a margin of erroraround these forecasts and in managing the programmes it is right to take acautious view.   I suggest that we allow in our discussion for the possibilitythat, on average, prices may exceed the provision we agreed for the cashlimits by about 3-3^ percentage points.    (In suggesting these figures I havetaken as a working assumption that specific indirect taxes will be increasedin the Budget in line with the movement of prices over the last year.    I willcomment orally on this at Cabinet.)4. On pay, leaving aside the Civil Service on which we have a separatepaper, and the armed forces for which I accept that the defence cash limitshould be adjusted to accommodate the costs of our commitment to maintainfull comparability, the current expectation is that new public service paysettlements may on average lead to about 15 per cent increase in earnings.The squeeze exerted by cash limits as now set will depend on the outcome ofeach set of negotiations.    Our aim must be to keep that outcome at low aspossible.5. These considerations suggest that, save to the extent that they resultin improved efficiency, the cash limits set in accordance with our previousdecision would reduce the volume of the central Government and localauthority capital expenditure in 1980-81 which they cover by about 500 million at 1979 Survey prices, equivalent to 2 per cent of theexpenditure, plus the value of whatever cut in Civil Service manpowerresults from our decision on Civil Service pay.6. The question is whether we should increase the provision so faragreed for cash limits on categories 3. and 4. on this account.    My adviceis that we should not, for the following reasons:First, it would require countervailing tax increases to enable meto achieve my target for the Public Sector Borrowing Requirementin 1980-81.    The further specific reductions which we agreed inexpenditure programmes for 1980-81 fell some way short of the targetof  1000 million which we set ourselves before Christmas.Second, a squeeze on the scale envisaged is smaller than some whichhave occurred in recent years, and substantially smaller than thatwhich occurred this year, when the general price increase allowedfor in the cash limits was only 8j per cent.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThird, increases in the provision in central Government cash limitswould precipitate pressure to increase the cash limits already setand published for the rate support grant and external financinglimits for the nationalised industries.Fourth, a moderate squeeze through cash limits can be accommodatedby, and is a useful spur to, efficiency and the reduction of waste.7. There is, however, an interaction between our decision on this andour decision for category 5., ie Civil Service pay.   If we decided that wehad to provide more than 14 per cent for Civil Service pay increases, itwould become much harder to resist arguments for an increase in theprovision so far agreed in cash limits generally.    Taking account of theClegg and other comparability awards and of the staging of other pastawards, provision of 14 per cent now would mean that between 1979-80 and1980-81 the total public service paybill is likely to rise by some 24 per cent.We cannot afford to add to this figure by making the provision now underdiscussion more than 14 per cent.CONCLUSION8. I invite Cabinet to confirm our- earlier decision that the 1980-81 cashlimits for central Government expenditure and for local authority capitalexpenditure should incorporate provision for a 14 per cent increase incurrent expenditure costs, and the slightly higher provision as previouslyagreed for capital expenditure.    (This excludes Civil Service pay which isthe subject of a separate paper; and the Rate Support Grant for which ourprevious 13 per cent decision already announced stands).    Each Ministershould so manage the expenditure for which he is responsible as to keepwithin the cash limit so set, adjusting the volume programme so far as mayprove necessary.G HTreasury Chambers25 February 19803CONFIDENTIAL
