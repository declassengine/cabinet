I1^ ANNUAL REVIEW OF AGRICULTURE 1980INTRODUCTION1. This White Paper sets out the data considered during the Annual Reviewof the economic condition and prospects of the United Kingdom agriculturalindustry. It provides information on which the Government will draw, asappropriate, when considering proposals by the EEC Commission for agri-cultural support in 1980/81 and when decisions are taken on support arrange-ments which remain within our national competence. As usual, these decisionswill be announced separately. In most cases, the forecasts for 1979 in the WhitePaper were made in November 1979.PART I STATE OF THE INDUSTRY2. The weather in the early part of 1979 was particularly severe and there wasa cold, wet spring. Later on, conditions in many parts of the country werefavourable but there were some difficulties, for example in securing foddersupplies in northern areas and during the harvest in Scotland. Net product,which measures in volume terms the contribution from agriculture to netnational product, fell by some 7&gt;\% from the high level reached in 1978. One ofthe reasons for this decline was the harsh weather which, for example, madeincreased feed purchases necessary. The prices of the industry&apos;s inputs increasedby about 13% but this increase was not matched by output prices. Net incomeat current prices is expected to fall by about 5|% in 1979, a reduction of about17% in real terms. The volume of new fixed capital investment which rose by9J% in 1978 is expected to show little change in 1979. There were four devalua-tions of the green pound during 1979, three of 5% and one of just over 1%. TheUnited Kingdom&apos;s monetary compensatory amount (MCA), which on averagewas about 30% in 1978 and about 15% in 1979, was reduced after the devalua-tion in December 1979 to 3-5% for the main products except cereals, where thedevaluation will take effect at the beginning of the cereals year..3. The dairy herd at June 1979 was marginally higher than in 1978; milkproduction over the whole year was also slightly higher. The beef herd fell bynearly 3% and home production of beef was about 1 % lower. The sheep breedingherd continued to increase but the lamb crop declined by 3%. Home productionof sheepmeat is expected to remain at about the same level as in 1978. The pigbreeding herd began to contract again. Supplies of home-fed pigmeat should beabout 6% higher in 1979, reflecting the increase in the breeding herd in 1978, butare expected to fall again in 1980. Production of poultrymeat rose in 1979 whilstegg production declined.4. Cereal yields, particularly of wheat, were generally high. Total productionin 1979 is expected to reach a new record level. Potato planting was very late insome parts of the country; yields were not as good as in 1978, but suppliesshould be adequate to meet demand. It is expected that the area of sugar beetharvested will increase again, and it is possible that a record crop will be achieved.5. The area devoted to horticultural crops fell again in 1979. As in 1978, thegreater part of the decline was in the field vegetables sector.1
PART II GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS MFarm Structure (Table 3)6. The number of farms in the United Kingdom continues to decline. In 1979the total number of holdings was about 257,000, that is some 4% lower than in1975. The fall in numbers continues to be most marked among the smaller full-time businesses, while the number of large businesses (1,000 standard man-daysor more) is increasing. Nearly half the total number of holdings have businessescapable of providing work for at least one man (ie those of 250 standard man-days or more) and these account for 90% of total output; large businesses,although only a little over 10% of the total number, produce about a half oftotal output. In Northern Ireland and Wales the output of small-scale farmersis rather more significant than in other parts of the United Kingdom.7. The average area (ie the total area including rough grazings) of a full-time business of 250 standard man-days or more has risen from 111 hectares in1975 to 113 hectares. The size of individual enterprises continues to expand.There has been an increase in the average area of cereals from 30 to 35 hectaresover the last four years, while the average dairy herd has expanded over thisperiod by nearly 25% from 40 to 49 cows. The average size of beef breedingherds has stabilised at 18 cows, but the average ewe flock has risen to 175breeding sheep compared with 164 in 1975. The average size of pig breedingherds has increased by 30% from 23 to 30 sows, while fattening herds reached anaverage size of203 pigs in June 1979 compared with 156 in 1975.8. In Great Britain 65% of the holdings were wholly or mainly owner-occupied in 1979 compared with 54% in 1960/61. The proportion of the totalarea held by owner-occupiers has increased from 52% in 1960/61 to 58% in1979. In Northern Ireland virtually all farmers are owner-occupiers.Index of net product (Table 19)9. The index of net product for 1979 is expected to fall back to 114 afterreaching 118 in 1978. Additional purchases of feedingstuffs during the hardweather in the first half of 1979 and the reduced volume of output of cattle andhorticulture contributed to this fall.Labour productivity (Tables 4 and 19)10. The index of labour productivity (the volume of gross agriculturalproduct per person engaged) has increased on average by about 3J% annuallyover the last 10 years despite the setback in the droughts of 1975 and 1976. Theincrease was 8% in 1978 but a slight fall (2 %) is forecast for 1979 following thecheck to output this year. The outflow of regular whole-time workers hascontinued. In 1979 the rate was 4 % compared with 4% in 1978 and 5% to6% in the 1960s.Net income of the industry (Tables 19, 21 and 24)11. Aggregate net income is estimated to have fallen by 3}% to  1,263million in 1978; and a reduction of 5 % to  1,193 million is forecast for 1979.In real terms this represents a fall of 11% between 1977 and 1978, and a fall ofabout 17% in 1979. The value of sales of most output items is forecast to rise2
signiflkntly in 1979, but the growth of expenditure on inputs is expected toexceea this owing to heavy purchases of feedingstuffs during the bad weatherin the first half of 1979 and the rise in the prices of input items.12. Samples of farm accounts, analysed both by size and type of farm and bycountry and region are examined at the Annual Review. The coverage of thisseries and several of the concepts on which it is based differ significantly fromthe aggregate calculation and therefore no direct comparison can be made. Inparticular the accounts relate only to full-time farms; they exclude the largestfarms (notably farms in the poultry sector in England and Wales) and they donot cover horticultural holdings. All farms are treated as tenanted. In addition,different treatment of valuations and stock appreciation can significantly affectthe year to which income from certain enterprises is attributed. For these andother reasons the latest results from the farm accounts (ending on average inmid-February 1979) show different changes in income from the aggregateseries.13. There have been two major changes this year affecting the results for thetwo years 1977/78 and 1978/79. First, all farms have been re-classified using thenew EEC system based on standard gross margins. The new specialist farmtypes are generally similar to those in the previous classification, but non-specialist and mixed types are significantly different. There are also separatecategories of cattle and sheep farm: those in the hills and uplands, and those inthe lowlands. The data for the individual type of farm for the last two years arenot, therefore, strictly comparable with previous years. Secondly, depreciation ofmachinery has been calculated on current values and not, as in previous years,on acquisition costs; this change has substantially reduced the absolute level ofnet income per farm.14. Net income per farm for all types taken together (excluding horticulture)rose in 1978/79 by 33 % in England, 21 % in Wales, 3% in Scotland and by athird in Northern Ireland, after falling in all countries except Wales in 1977/78.Although milk yields per cow and prices for milk and calves were higher thanin 1977/78, other factors outweighed this on many dairy farms in Scotland andincomes fell; but there was a significant increase in income on farms of this typein England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Hill and upland cattle and sheepfarms income rose on average in 1978/79, but the effects of the severe winter andlate spring will be shown in the 1979/80 accounts. Lowland cattle and sheepfarms had higher incomes although these were significantly affected in NorthernIreland by large valuation changes. Substantial income increases on generalcropping farms in England, following a 57% decline in 1977/78, reflected goodyields in 1978 for most crops and better prices. In Scotland, however, theharvest was poor and with low potato prices resulted in a further fall in incomeon cropping farms generally. Higher cereal and fat pig prices in 1978/79 resultedin an increase in income on pig and poultry farms despite lower egg prices.Incomes overall rose in real terms in England, Wales and Northern Ireland butfell in Scotland.15. Forecasts of the results for 1979/80 suggest an appreciable fall in netincome per farm in all countries, affecting all types except some cropping farms.The adverse weather in the first half of 1979 led to slow grass and forage growth,and the summer was unfavourable for fodder conservation in northern and west-ern areas, although autumn grazing was good in some regions. Appreciable3
cost increases, especially for fuel and fodder have not been offset by a K;ghervalue of output except on some cropping farms. Hill farms in particular aavehad a poor year. The higher feed costs, the smaller number of lambs for sale andthe lower prices for ewes and store lambs are likely to have reduced incomes bybetween two thirds and a third. The increases in the Hill Livestock Compensa-tory Allowances announced in November will, of course, have some offsettingeffects. The rise in fat cattle prices in the early part of the year should increaseincomes in some fattening enterprises. Yields per cow and prices of milk are alittle higher but calf prices are at or below 1978 levels; the value of total outputwill not increase sufficiently on many specialist dairy farms to offset higher costs;and income will therefore fall, especially in northern areas. Good cereal cropsand higher prices for cereals, potatoes and sugar beet should maintain incomeson cropping farms despite higher costs. Net income on most pig and poultryfarms is likely to be lower than in 1978/79 despite the recent increase in fat pigprices and generally higher prices for eggs and some poultry. The fall in incomesin real terms on average on all types of farm is expected to be severe in allcountries.Price changes16. The prices of agricultural inputs, including labour, increased on averageby about 13% between 1978 and 1979; for bought-in goods and services theincrease is expected to be about 11%. Prices of outputs increased on average byabout 11% between 1978 and 1979 with a particularly large increase of about39% in potato prices which had been very depressed in 1978.Gross capital formation (Table 22)17. It is estimated that the value of new investment will increase again in 1979.The industry&apos;s gross capital formation in fixed assets of  1,075 million will be12% higher than in 1978. Investment in plant, machinery and vehicles is expectedto be  687 million, an increase of 9%, and in buildings and works  388 million, arise of 17% compared with the 1978 level. The value of stocks and work-in-progress is expected to increase by 20% in 1979 following the sharp decline in1978. In volume terms total gross fixed capital formation is expected to be thesame in 1979 as in 1978. New investment in plant, machinery and vehicles isexpected to decline very slightly. The 20% rise in the volume of buildings andworks in 1978 is expected to be followed by an increase of some 3% in 1979.Bank borrowings18. Bank advances to agriculture for 1979 as a whole are forecast to be over 2,200 million, some 30% above the average for 1978 and more than 70% above1977. The rising level of borrowing reflects some increase in loans for landpurchase and for increased costs of investment in buildings and works, butborrowing for current farming purposes has also been increasing.Agricultural land prices (Table 23)19. Agricultural land prices have increased markedly since 1975. Informationfrom the comprehensive Inland Revenue series indicates that, in 1978, the averageprice per hectare of agricultural land sold with vacant possession reached  2,602in England,  1,788 in Wales,  1,090 in Scotland and  2,618 in Northern Ireland.4
More^recent information from the less comprehensive ADAS/AMC series,whic.lbtovers England and Wales only, indicates that there has been somelevelling off in prices since the middle of 1979.Farm rents (Table 23)20. On the basis of the provisional results of the ADAS Rent Enquiry inEngland and Wales and of the continuing field survey in Scotland, average farmrents in the United Kingdom are estimated to have increased by nearly 17% in1979. This compares with an increase of 18% in 1978.Farm workers&apos; earnings (Table 20)21. The average weekly earnings of whole-time hired men in the UK were 61-75 in 1978 compared with  54-69 in 1977 (calendar year averages). Thisrepresents an increase of 13% in money terms and 4J% in real terms. In 1979earnings are forecast to be about  70-40, an increase of 14% in money terms butless than 1% in real terms. Increases in statutory minimum weekly wage ratesfor whole-time hired workers in England and Wales effective from 21 January1980 range from  9-50 (19-6%) for Ordinary workers to  15-25 (24-2%) forGrade I workers; increases for Scotland effective from 17 December 1979 rangefrom  6-75 (13-8%) for General workers to  9-80 (17-2%) for Stock workers;and the increase for Northern Ireland effective from 4 February 1980 is  9-50(19-6%) for Agricultural workers.Public expenditure (Table 25)22. In 1979/80 the estimated outturn for expenditure in the United Kingdomon price guarantees, grants and subsidies (excluding the brucellosis incentivesand residual payments connected with the milk subsidy) is  323 million (ofwhich  32 million reflects payments deferred from 1978/79 as a result of industrialaction) compared with  208 million in 1978/79. The true increase in expenditurein 1979/80 after discounting deferred payments is  52 million. Within this figurethere are increases on the Farm and Horticulture Development Scheme(+ 26 m), the Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances (+ 23 m), the MilkNon-Marketing and Conversion Premium Schemes (+ 7 m) and the FarmCapital Grant Scheme (+ 7 m), and a reduction in expenditure under thepotato guarantee arrangements (  14 m).23. Expenditure under the common market organisation of the EEC isestimated to be about  406 million in 1979/80 compared with expenditure ofsome  330 million in 1978/79. This expenditure by the Intervention Board forAgricultural Produce includes the butter and school milk subsidies, the BeefPremium Scheme, import and export refunds, certain production subsidies, aidsto animal feeds, the gross costs of aid to private storage and the net cost ofcommodities bought into intervention and subsequently sold. Some of thisexpenditure benefits consumers and overseas exporting interests rather thanproducers. The additional expenditure in 1979/80 is partly due to paymentsdeferred from 1978/79 due to industrial action; and to increases in productionsubsidies and export refunds on third country trade; but there has been a de-crease in the overall cost of intervention activity.5
PART m COMMODITY TRENDSCereals (Tables 2, 5, 7 and 26)24. In 1979, cereals were grown on some 3-87 million hectares (an increase of0-06 million over 1978). Production is expected to reach 17-3 million tonnes intotal, some 73,000 tonnes above the 1978 figure. Good sowing conditions in theautumn of 1978 led to an increase in the wheat area, at the expense of oats andgrassland. The harvest was generally later than usual, particularly in the northYields, particularly of wheat, were generally high, but the quality of the cropwas very variable. Following the big harvest in 1978 market prices fell and thenrose steadily as export trade developed. Later, when the effects of the hard wintergave rise to an increased usage of feed grains, prices became firm because ashortage was expected but fell again when the shortage failed to materialise.Favourable weather in the autumn of 1979 enabled a large area of wintercereals to be sown.Oilseed rape (Tables 2, 5, 8 and 26)25. A record oilseed rape crop of 192,000 tonnes, about 25% higher than theprevious year, is expected in 1979. The increase is due mainly to a rise by 10,000hectares to 74,000 hectares in the area harvested, but a slight improvement inyield also contributed to this. A further rise in production is expected in 1980.Prices generally remained above the intervention price during the first part of1979, but later tended to fall and small quantities were bought into intervention.Potatoes (Tables 2, 5, 9 and 26)26. In 1979 the target area of 198,000 hectares was exceeded by some 5,000hectares. Planting was very late in some parts of the country and, althoughgrowing conditions were reasonable, yields were not as good as those obtainedin 1978. Nevertheless, supplies should be adequate to meet demand. With theaim of ensuring stability in the market throughout the season the PotatoMarketing Board offered producers a contract for a proportion of the crop.The intention was to remove up to 500,000 tonnes of potatoes from the marketin Great Britain should this prove necessary, but in the event the market wasbuoyant and producers offered the Board only 80,000 tonnes.27. Discussions have continued on proposals for an EEC potato regime; itremains uncertain how soon agreement will be reached. The form of marketsupport arrangements for the 1980 crop will depend on whether an EEC regimeis by then in operation.Sugar beet (Tables 2, 5,10 and 26)28. For 1979 the British Sugar Corporation contracted to purchase the beetfrom 217,000 hectares. About 212,000 hectares are expected to be harvested, anincrease over 1978. Weather during the growing season has been generally good;yield of beet per hectare is similar to 1978; and sugar content is high, possiblyhigher than in 1978. Provided that harvesting and processing are not disruptedby adverse weather the crop should yield over one million tonnes of white sugar.Thus a record crop is possible. (The existing record of 1-086 million tonnes wasachieved in 1971.) Contracting for 1980 has not yet been completed but theCorporation aims to increase its contracted area again.6
HoribliJture (Tables 2, 5, 11 and 26)29. The area devoted to horticultural crops, which was about 289,000 hectaresin June 1978, fell to about 277,000 hectares. Details are given for the fourcommodities grown in the United Kingdom which are affected by Communityintervention arrangements in the fruit and vegetables sector.(o) Apples. The decline in the area of apple orchards was halted in 1979;the area (excluding cider apples) remained at an estimated 30,000hectares. The area under orchards of cooking apples increased slightly,offsetting the continuing decline in the dessert apple area. The latespring did not interfere with pollination and yields of dessert appleswere the highest for several years. Yields of cooking apples, althoughbelow the very high level of 1978, were still good. Owing to the biggercrop and increased competition from France and Italy, prices of 1979crop dessert apples were below those of 1978. Cooking apple priceswere also slightly down.(b) Pears. The area under pears (excluding perry pears) has declinedslightly in recent years and was estimated to be 4,500 hectares in 1979.Production in 1979 was the highest for several years and as a result ofthis, and because of pressure from imports, prices were the lowestsince 1976.(c) Cauliflowers. The area under cauliflowers rose slightly to 15,000hectares in 1979. Production, however, dropped sharply becausesevere weather wiped out much of the over-wintered crop. Averageprices were considerably higher than in 1978.(d) Tomatoes. The glasshouse area used for tomato production remainedat about 1,000 hectares. Production rose slightly. Average prices fellbecause of over-supply and a related sharp fall in prices in the latterpart of the season, due to the late ripening of early plantings andincreased competition from imports.Hops (Tables 2, 5, 12 and 26)30. The area under hops declined slightly in 1979. Production and averageprices were both above those for 1978.Seeds (Table 13)31. The area sown for certified herbage and legume seed production in 1979(excluding field bean and field pea seed) declined slightly after the steep rise ofthe previous year. Yields generally were reasonable. Prices rose slightly anddemand in the spring of 1980 is expected to be firm. Supplies are generallyadequate. Imports rose in 1978/79 and continued to account for just over 50%of supplies; exports also increased.32. The area of certified field bean seed more than doubled in 1979. The areaof certified field pea seed decreased by about 40%, but supplies are still adequate.Beef and Milk (Tables 2, 5, 14, 15, 16 and 26)33. The 1979 June census showed a decline of less than 1% in the total UKbreeding herd, compared with the previous year. The dairy herd about 68%of all breeding cows showed a marginal increase, but the beef herd fell bynearly 3%.7AA A2*
34. Home production of beef in 1979 is expected to be about 1% d&lt; ~y on1978. This decline is expected to be balanced by higher imports and lowerexports, leaving total supplies for consumption about the same as in 1978.Average market prices for certified cattle in the United Kingdom remained abovethe target price until October 1979, when the seasonal decline caused smallamounts of premium to be paid, mostly in Northern Ireland. Prices reached apeak of 88-38p per live kg in early July, falling seasonally to just under 72-50pper live kg in early October to late November. Because of the generally firmprices intervention was suspended for significant periods; at other times onlymoderate intervention was needed to underpin the market.35. The average milk yield per cow in 1979 is expected to show a slightimprovement of about \% on the 1978 level, while the average size of thenational dairy herd over the year as a whole is expected to increase marginallyover the previous year. As a result milk production in 1979 is expected to showan increase of a little over \% compared with that for 1978. The amount ofmilk sold for liquid consumption in 1979 is expected to fall by less than \%compared with 1978. Together with the increase in production this should leadto a small increase in the availability of milk for manufacture. Cheese productionin 1979 is expected to increase by about 8-5% over the previous year&apos;s level,but butter production is expected to fall by about 2 %.36. Since 1 January 1978, producer returns have been determined by theMilk Marketing Boards, on the basis of their returns from the liquid andmanufacturing milk markets. It is expected that the Boards&apos; net returns from allmilk for the 1979/80 year will be between 12-01 ppl and 12-21 ppl (54-5 ppg and55-5 ppg); this reflects increases in the retail price of milk per pint of l p inJune 1979 and 1 Jp in February 1980.37. The average size of the national dairy herd in 1980 is expected to remainclose to the level in 1979, implying that any increase in milk production woulddepend on further improvements in yields.Sheep and Wool (Tables 2, 14, 18 and 26)38. Between June 1978 and June 1979 the total breeding flock increased by3%, with an increase of 6% in the number of shearling ewes. The lamb cropdeclined by 3% on the previous year but, despite a slight increase in slaughteringsin 1979, the breeding flock may show a further small increase in 1980.39. UK home production of sheepmeat in 1979 is expected to be slightlybelow the 1978 level. Supplies available to the United Kingdom home marketare expected to fall by about 4%, with imports falling by about 8% and exportsdeclining slightly. In 1979 prices for fat sheep reached record levels in May, butfell below the guarantee level on 10 September and remained there throughoutthe autumn. On average, prices in 1979 were about the 1978 level. While pricespaid for some store lambs rose, prices for store lambs from the hills and hillewes were mostly below those paid in 1978.40. Production of wool fell by about 1 % in 1979. Market prices began the1979 season slightly below last year&apos;s level and are expected to remain below theguarantee on average for the 1979 clip; producers&apos; returns will again be madegood from the stabilisation fund built up from earlier surpluses.8
PigAables 2,14 and 26)41. The reduction in pigmeat MCAs from 28-2% in January 1979 to 3-5% inDecember should improve the competitive position of the industry. Increases inpig prices since June 1979 and more stable feed costs have improved producers&apos;margins. Production of pigmeat in 1979 is expected to be 6% higher than in 1978.42. In 1980 production is expected to be at a lower level than in 1979, reflectingthe decline in the breeding herd in 1979, but the recent improvement in profit-ability is expected to continue into 1980 and to lead in due course to an increasein the breeding herd.Poultrymeat (Tables 2,14 and 26)43. Output of poultrymeat is expected to show another increase in 1979, butlittle further change in production levels is expected for 1980. Poultrymeatprices rose during 1979.Eggs (Tables 2, 5, 17 and 26)44. Producer prices were at low levels in 1978. It is expected that productionwill show some decline in 1979 and 1980 and that prices will be above the 1978level.9

APPENDIXSTATISTICAL TABLESThe tables cover largely the same ground as those in last year&apos;s White Paper except that:Table 1(a) In the assessment of agriculture&apos;s contribution to gross domestic product, the revisedfigures are based on the new method of calculating the aggregated agriculturalaccounts (see note below on the main changes in Table 21).(b) Revised figures for agriculture&apos;s share of gross fixed capital formation incorporatechanges in the methods used to estimate plant and machinery and the movement inprices for buildings and works.(c) The annual average index numbers of the prices of goods and services currentlyconsumed in agriculture or contributing to agricultural investment and of producerprices of agricultural products are a new series based on 1975 = 100. Trie valueweights for the series are derived from the Economic Accounts for Agriculture 1975prepared for the Statistical Office of the European Communities.(d) The values of home produced food as a percentage of all food consumed in the UKaim to provide a measure of the changing contribution of home agriculture to UKfood supplies. UK production now includes the value of food exports but excludesthe value of net imports of agricultural inputs.Tables 19 and 21The basis of the income and net product calculations shown in Tables 19 and 21 hasbeen changed. First, to bring UK figures into line with EEC statistics, estimates forminor sectors such as agricultural contractors and very small holdings have beenincluded. For the same reason there have also been changes in the treatment of stocks.Second, the national farm has been treated as wholly owner-occupied, since this iscloser to the actual position than the approach in previous years which was to treatit as wholly tenanted. The absolute level of net income and net product has thereforechanged, but most trends are not significantly altered.Table 24There have been two important changes in the specimen net income per farmpresented in this table. First, each farm has been classified by type of farming and sizeof business according to the new EEC system based on standard gross margins.Secondly, depreciation has been calculated on inventories of machinery, glasshousesand permanent crops valued at replacement cost (rather than acquisition cost as intiie past). This change in accounting convention has substantially reduced theabsolute level of net farm income.Even where there has been no change in the basis of the tables, some of the figures in thisappendix differ from those in previous Annual Review White Papers because of later infor-mation, changes in the scope and nature of available data and improvements in statisticalmethods. The forecasts for 1979 generally reflect the position up to the end of the year, as seenat November 1979.All figures relate to the United Kingdom, unless otherwise stated.Figures for imports from and exports to the Eight relate throughout to the other countriesof the European Economic Community (Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, theIrish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands).Significant items of Channel Islands trade are shown separately in the tables.Figures for exports include re-exports.In some cases figures may not add up to the totals shown because of roundings.Symbols:  means &quot;nil&quot;... means &quot;negligible&quot; (less than half the last digit shown).. means &quot;not available&quot; or &quot;not applicable&quot;.11

Tabu*?- {continued)(ft) The coverage for 1973 and onwards includes all known holdings in the United Kingdom with 40 standardman-days or more (a standard man-day (smd) represents 8 hours&apos; productive work by an adult male workerunder average conditions). All holdings with less than 40 smd in Scotland are excluded but in England and Walesand Northern Ireland holdings with less than 40 smd are excluded only if they have less than 4 hectares ofcrops and grass and no regular whole-time worker. The same criteria applied in Great Britain in the years1970 to 1972, and in England and Wales in the years 1968 and 1969, except that the threshold for standardlabour requirements in those years was 26 smd.The 1968-69 figures for Scotland related to all known agricultural holdings exceeding one acre (0*4 hectares)in extent. The figures for Northern Ireland for these years related to holdings of one acre (0*4 hectares) ormore, except for numbers of livestock which were collected from all owners, irrespective of? the size of theholding, as well as from land-less stockholders.The introduction of the changes of definition in Northern Ireland in 1973, following similar changes in GreatBritain which excluded some 14 000 statistically insignificant holdings in 1970 and about 8 000 in 1973, hadthe net result of eliminating about 6 000 or so holdings from the Northern Ireland census.(6) Cereals for threshing, excluding maize.(c) Includes small area of soft fruit grown under orchard trees in England and Wales.id) Hardy nursery stock, bulbs and flowers.(e) Most of the difference between total horticultural area and the sum of individual sectors is made up by theglasshouse area.CO Includes area of other crops and bare fallow not shown in the table.(g) Includes lucerne.(h) Before 1975 collected as:In England and Wales &quot;clover, sainfoin and temporary grasses*&apos;;In Scotland  &quot;grass under 7 years old&quot;;In Northern Ireland  &quot; 1 st, 2nd and 3rd year&quot;.(0 Before 1975 collected as:In England and Wales &quot;permanent grass&quot;;In Scotland  &quot;grass 7 years old and over&quot;;In Northern Ireland  &quot;4th year or older&quot;.(J) Returns of &quot;other land&quot; were collected for the first time in England and Wales in June 1969. From June 1969 toJune 1973 &quot;other land&quot;in Great Britain was collected as woodland and areas under roads, yards, buildings, etc.,the use of which was ancillary to farming of the land; in Northern Ireland it included land within agriculturalholdings which was under bog, water, roads, buildings, etc, and waste land not used for agriculture. In June1974 the definition was changed in England and Wales to include all other land forming part of the holdingand in Scotland it was extended to include ponds and derelict land.

Although the figures quoted for 1975 and 1979are strictly comparable, great caution must be exercised in comparing them with figures quoted in AnnualReview White Papers published prior to 1978. The figures included for Northern Ireland in the first two sectionsfor both years relate only to holdings with SO smd or more.(6) The average size of holdings based on total area was 1975 66* 1 hectares of which 45 *2 hectares were crops and grass1979  68*1 hectares of which 47-8 hectares were crops and grass.(c) These figures include holdings with no crops and grass area which are excluded from the first section of thetable.(&lt;f) Revised standard man-day groups were adopted two years ago when the lower group of under 250 smd appliedthroughout the UK. The change in smd values has meant a general shift of holdings into lower size groups andthis movement is particularly marked in Northern Ireland as the following figures show: Holdings In Northern Ireland June 1975 (&apos;000)Based on Based onold smd values new smd values50-199 smd       16-0 50-249 smd 20*0200-599smd       12-6 250-499 smd 6-9600-1199 smd       3-8 500-999 smd 2-81 200 smd and over   1-2 1 000 smd and over 0*7Total             33-6 Total 30*4As a result of this change, the figures shown in this table are only comparable with those in the 1978 and 1979White Papers.(e) Figures relate to P&quot;b* **4 and Wales only.if) Figures included for Scotland and Northern Ireland relate to the December censuses in 1974 and 1978.C?)

Before 1977 the figures do not include the wives/husbands of farmers, partners and directors,even though the wives/husbands themselves may be partners or directors. In 1977 wives/husbands of farmers,partners and directors were returned separately, but only if they were engaged in farm work.(b) Figures relate to Great Britain only.(c) Includes seasonal or casual workers in Northern Ireland. See footnote ( /) (d) Before 1975 seasonal or casual workers were not returned as a separate item in Northern Ireland, but wereincluded with part-time workers.(e) The increase in numbers of farmers, partners and directors in 1976 occurred in England and Wales and isthought to reflect a more complete enumeration in the Agricultural Census.(/) The decrease in the number of regular whole-time and part-time female workers in 1977 is thought to beexplained by the separate return, for the first time in England and Wales, of farmers&apos; wives, some of whomwere probably returned previously as family workers.19

Investment includes aiphysical assets such as land improvements, buildings, livestock, machinery, etc but excludes any financialassets. Net income also includes the income of some minor sectors such as agricultural contractors and v?rysmall holdings, which have been excluded previously. The estimates of aggregate net income include a profiton the production of food for consumption in the farm household, hi other industries the corresponding sumsare not treated as profit and are relatively much smaller (in many cases non-existent).(b) Changes have bees made this year to the basis of the calculation of the income accounts as explained on page11. Net income figures on the same basis as the 1979 White Paper are  1 300 million in 1977,  1120 millionfa 1978 and  1052million in 1979.(c) Net Product (Net Output) is a measure of the value added at constant prices by farmers and farmworkers toall the goods and services purchased from outside the agriculutral sector, after provision has been made fordepreciation.{d) Labour Productivity if defined here as gross product per person engaged in agriculture. Gross product isgross output leu all inputs other than depreciation, labour and interest, measured at constant prices. Thetotal number of persons engaged is estimated for this series from the numbers of full-time, part-time andseasonal/casual employees, employers and self-employed returned in the annual June censuses held by theAgriculture Departments.Table 20Average earnings and hours of agricultural workers (a)Calendar years	1975	1976	1977	1978	1979 (forecast)Earnings   per week (6) Hours per week (c) ......	42-92 46-0	50-28 45-5	54-69 45-9	61-75 45-8	70-41 45-9(a) For all hired regular whole-time male workers 20 years old and over.(6) Earnings include pay for statutory holidays and payments in kind which are valued at rates set down by theAgricultural Wages Boards and comprise houses, rnilk, potatoes, etc (the principal one being houses, most ofwhich were, in England and Wales, valued at 50p before 20 January 1976 and  1   50 thereafter).(c) All hours worked and statutory holidays.35

In addition, the series shown for Scotland refer to equip-ped farms only and exclude sales of unequipped land, whole estates, land sold for afforestation and inter-family sales. There is a delay between the date on which a sale is agreed and the date on which it is includedin the series. The delay is thought to average about 6-9 months in England and Wales and about 3 monthsin Northern Ireland. The average prices shown in the table for each calendar year relate to sales included inthe series for these countries in the years ending in the following September and March respectively. The data forScotland and Northern Ireland are subject to retrospective revision.( ) The indices of average rents for England and Wales are based on an annual rent enquiry and for Scotland oncontinuing field enquiries. They differ from the series previously published in two respects; the England andWales series have now been put on to a rent paid basis more comparable with the series for Scotland, and theUnited Kingdom index has been obtained by weighting the individual series according to the area of rentedland in each country. Very little land is rented, except under the conacre system, in Northern Ireland.(c) The figures for the most recent years are subject to revision and those in brackets are substantially incompleteas detailed below:Agricul tural Land PricesScotland: 1979 figures relate to prices in the first 6 months of the year.

Tabls^4 (continued)(a) 1~(note on page 11 explains two important changes in the specimen net income per farm presented in thisTable. These figures are collected by Universities and Agricultural Colleges in Great Britain and the Depart-ment of Agriculture in Northern Ireland. They are averages weighted by the census distribution of agriculturalholdings by type of farming and size of business. More detailed figures for England will be published in &quot;FarmIncomes in England 1978/79&quot;, for Scotland in &quot;Scottish Agricultural Economics 1979&quot;, for Northern Irelandin &quot;Farm Incomes and Investment in Northern Ireland for 1978/79&quot; and for Wales in the &quot;Annual Digest ofWelsh Agricultural Statistics 1978/79 Part II&quot;. Net income is defined as in the aggregate series (Tables 19 and 21)except that stock appreciation is assessed at current market prices and that no deduction is made for intereston farming debts. Net income is shown in this table excluding that part of the total valuation change which isattributable to changes during the trading year in estimated market values (but not in the numbers) of breedingcattle, sheep and pigs. All farms are treated as rented and an imputed rental value is charged as an expense inthe accounts of owner-occupiers. The accounts relate in the main to calendar years or to the year ending 5April. The average year-ending date is about mid-February.(6) Provisional figures.(c) Based on standard gross margins per unit of crop area and per head of livestock, measured in European SizeUnits (ESU) with 1 ESU equalling 1 000 European units of account of standard gross margins at average1972-1974 values. See EEC Commission Decision 78/463/EEC.(&lt;/) Includes net income of a small sample of &quot;hill and upland (LFA) sheep&quot; farms.(e) Includes &quot;specialist dairy&apos;&apos; and &quot;mainly dairy&apos;&apos; farm types.v) Includes &quot;lowland cattle and sheep&apos;&apos; and &quot;lowland cropping, cattle and sheep&quot; farm types.(f) Almost all farm businesses in Northern Ireland are based on owner-occupied holdings. As rents cannot beimputed with reference to tentntftd farms, the rental charges entered for owned land and buildings have beenassessed in relation to estimated sale value. Where land was taken in conacre, the actual rents paid have beenincluded. For these reasons the average net incomes per farm are not on the same basis as those for GreatBritain.(a) 4 to less than 16ESU.(0 Includes &quot;Non-Less Favoured Areas (LFA) cropping, cattle and sheep&quot;, &quot;mixed livestock&quot;, &quot;pigs and poultry&quot;and &quot;cropping&apos;&apos; farm types.Table 25Public expenditure under the common agricultural policy (CAP) and onnational grants and subsidies (a)April/March (financial) years   million	1975/76	1976/77	1977/78	1978/79 (b)	1979/80 (forecast) mI Price guarantees and production grants		___________			(i) Price guarantees (c)					Sheep .........

Tab (continued)(a) This table excludes expenditure which may benefit farmers but where the value to them is not shown by theexpenditure (eg expenditure on animal disease and pest control or on research, advice and education). Expendi-ture on agriculture in Northern Ireland, borne on the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund, is also excluded.It does, however, include some expenditure which benefits consumers and overseas exporting interests ratherthan producers (see note (A)). The figures for years up to and including 1977/78 represent actual expenditurerecorded in the Appropriation Accounts. The figures for 1978/79 are subject to confirmation and those for1979/80 are the latest estimates of expenditure.(6) The forecasts for expenditure in 1979/80 include payments which were due in 1978/79 but were delayed byindustrial action.(c) Exdudes payments for milk which have been attributed to the f ood subsidies programme.(d) Payments in respect of wool and potatoes relate partly to the clip or crop of the year indicated and partly tothe clip or crop in the preceding year or years. The negative figures reflect the arrangements with the BritishWool Marketing Board, whereby deficiency payments made by the Exchequer are repayable from surpluses(excess of market price over guaranteed price) up to the amount of debt owing by the Board to Ministers.(e) Farmers in special areas are also eligible for additional assistance under the Farm and Horticulture Develop-ment Scheme and the Farm Capital Grant Scheme. The estimated benefit is shown separately in section ulof the table.(/) Includes grants in respect of investment on loan guarantees*, farm structure loans*, producer organisations*,small horticultural production businesses, small farmers, farm business records, water supply*, agriculturaldrainage*, special assistance to livestock producers and hops restructuring. (Provision for the schemes marked* was included in the 1979/80 Supply Estimates).(g) Includes grants for improvement of hill land and livestock rearing land, rural roads*, forage groups*, producersin the Scottish Islands*, crofting improvements* and the hill cattle agistment subsidy. (Provision for the schemesmarked * was included m the 1979/80 Supply Estimates).(A) The figures shown are total expenditure before allowing for receipts from FEOGA which are shown separatelyat the foot of the table. The figures are made up of several elements and include import refunds (net of exportlevies) on intra-Community trade, import and export refunds on third country trade, the beef premium scheme,aid for private storage and animal feed, certain production subsidies and the net cost of commodities boughtinto intervention and subsequently sold. Some of the expenditure benefits consumers and. overseas exportinginterests rather than producers. The figures for 1975/76 and 1976/77 include the special import subsidy onsugar, those for 1977/78 onwards the EEC butter subsidy, and those for 1978/79 onwards the UK share ofthe EEC school milk subsidy scheme.(J) Includes eggs, poultrymeat, fruit and vegetables, oilseeds, hops, herbage and legume seeds, dehydrated fodder,fisheries and flax. Also includes expenditure on products covered by the CAP but not produced to any significantextent in the United Kingdom (olive oil, rice, wine and hemp).43
