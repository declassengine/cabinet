CONFIDENTIALCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 422 January-1980COrY NOCABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  ECONOMIC AND MONETARY BACKGROUNDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. At Cabinet on 13 December (CC(79) 25th Conclusions, Minute 6) I wasasked to circulate a further paper on the economic background to the publicexpenditure problem and on the Government&apos;s monetary strategy and methodsof monetary control.ECONOMIC BACKGROUND2. My earlier paper (C(79) 61) explained why the reduction in publicexpenditure plans agreed by the Cabinet last autumn were insufficient and whyit was essential to secure levels of public expenditure much closer to thoseoriginally proposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and myself. Therehave been several unfavourable developments in the world and domestic scenessince our last discussion.3. On the external side, political uncertainties have worsened and higheroil prices have caused most forecasters substantially to reduce theirprojections of world trade and activity.    The Oiganisation for EconomicCo-operation and Development (OECD) estimate that each 10 per cent rise inthe world oil price will reduce the growth of OECD economies as a whole in1980 by about \ per cent.    They now forecast little, if any, growth forindustrialised countries in the coming year.4. The higher oil prices are less immediately damaging to the UnitedKingdom than to most industrial countries, but they are damaging nonetheless.They do not improve the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)prospect in 1980-81 and only slightly in 1981-82.    This is because the UnitedKingdom, as a country selling one-third of its manufacturing output abroad,cannot escape the contractionary effects of higher oil prices on worldactivity.    The effect on United Kingdom activity of this and cf any furtherworsening in competitiveness is to reduce receipts from other taxes,offsetting the increased receipts from North Sea taxation.    And many NorthSea fields in any case still have capital allowances to offset against additionalprofits before paying Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).    Moreover, because of1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALstart-up delays and other technical troubles in some North Sea fields, as wellas the flaring restrictions, estimates of United Kingdom oil production overthe next few years have recently been substantially scaled down; the earlierhopes that we would be self-sufficient in oil in 1980 are now unlikely to berealised.5. Thus higher* oil prices are unlikely to solve the particularly severebudgetary problems we face in the next two years.    I shall be exploring thescope for raising the PRT rate.    Even if this proved justified its main yieldwould be beyond these two critical years.6. On the domestic side, there is little sign as yet of improvement on themajor problems confronting the economy - inflation, low productivity and poortrading performance.    Pay settlements, and inflationary expectations, remainhigh; and the steel strike, if long continued, will have an increasinglydisruptive effect on industry.    Money supply growth has slowed, but it is tooearly to be certain that the trend is now within the target range. Moreover,despite the action I took in November, the latest indicators suggest that it isvirtually certain that this year&apos;s PSBR will come out higher than the 8.3 billion budgeted for in June.    In short, there is nothing in recentdevelopments to suggest that the prospects for the PSBR in 1980-81 and1981-82 are now better than those indicated in paragraph 11 of my earlier paper(C(79) 61), and they have almost certainly worsened.7. If we are to create conditions in which interest rates can be reduced itis vital to secure a better balance between revenue and expenditure. Thismeans restraining the brrrowing undertaken by Government in competition withthe private sector.    It is only when we have done enough along these lines toset interest rates on a downward path that we can begin to find room for ourother objectives - lower personal and capital taxes.8. Nothing that has happened in the past month eases our problems inthese respects; indeed recent events have made the constraints even tighter.Expenditure savings of the order of  1 billion in 1980-81 and  2 billion a yearthereafter beyond those agreed last year (in Survey prices and in addition towhatever reduction we can get in the net contribution to the EuropeanCommunity) are the minimum required to avoid serious damage to  ur taxobjectives and the risk of even higher interest rates.    Without these savingsthere is a serious risk that I shall have to increase taxes in the coming Budget.MONETARY STRATEGY ANB METHODS OF CONTROL9. Disciplined and tightly controlled money supply is essential in a worldof floating exchange rates.    It provides the only effective means of reducinginflation to a lower level and keeping it there.    This requires us to achievethe initial aim of bringing down the rate of monetary growth from the level weinherited, 13 per cent - or perhaps 3 per cent more allowing for the growth ofnear-substitutes - to our target of 9 per cent, and thereafter to achieve a2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsustained reduction over later years.    The target of 9 per cent was in anycase the highest compatible with our general approach, given our predecessors&apos;target of 10 per cent.10. Monetary policy needs to be applied consistently for several years if itis to work.    Only if it is sustained will it have the effect on expectationsnecessary to create the climate once more for responsible pay bargaining -a crucial message that we must all strive continually to get over.    This willnot be easy.    To abandon it at the first sign that it was proving painful wouldbe disastrous, since it would immediately signal that we had abandoned thestruggle against inflation and ruin our chances of destroying the perniciousexpectation that inflation will continue.    The effect on confidence in financialmarkets would be extremely serious.    The exchange rate would inevitablycome under pressure, and this would quickly add to inflation. Nominalinterest rates would be driven higher, possibly sooner, certainly later,because they would adjust to the change in inflationary expectations.    So therisks to the economy of failing to carry through the policy to which we arecommitted are very much greater than any short-term difficulties we may facein securing it.11. The main ways in which the Government can secure control of themoney supply and the related level of credit creation are fiscal policy and thelevel and structure of interest rates.    Interest rates affect both demand forcredit by the private sector, and our ability to finance the PSBR outside thebanking system, ie in a way which does not add to the money supply. Fiscalpolicy - both tax and public expenditure decisions - also affects demand forcredit by the private sector and by the public sector, by its effects on thePSBR.12. I fully understand the case for trying to avoid this primary reliance onfiscal policy and interest rates by using more direct controls, for exampleover bank lending.    (I am, after all, the main target of complaints againstthe present system. )   For this reason I have myself investigated carefully(indeed hopefully) all the alternative or supplementary methods that have beensuggested.    But I have not yet discovered the Alchemist&apos;s stone.13. Th&quot; truth is that financial markets operate in the same way as anyother.    There is in the end no alternative, by means of controls howeversubtle, to allowing the market to balance itself.    Thus in a sophisticatedfinancial system, alternative channels are rapidly developed outside anysystem of quantitative controls that seeks to constrain the level of creditextended below that demanded at the current level of interest rates.Experience of the &quot;corset&quot; has shown this clearly.     It may have some slighteffect on borrowing at the margin, but the one very strong and increasingeffect has been to develop alternative credit channels outside the control. Aclear example of this has been the growth of acceptances held outside thebanking system, under which money is channelled from one bank customerwho has money to spare to another bank customer who wishes to borrow,3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwithout it passing through the banking system.    It is therefore not recordedin the money supply statistics.    Avoidance oi this kind, if significant inamount and sustained over time, both means that the authorities are notconstraining liquidity and credit to the extent required by the policy, andbrings the target and monetary policy itself into disrepute.    It was because ofthese obvious shortcomings of the &quot;corset&quot; that I said on 15 November that Idid not see it as a permanent feature of the system of monetary control.14. Similar arguments apply to direct controls on consumer credit, such asmost of the hire purchase controls and credit cards.    In 1973, the lastConservative Government reimposed hire purchase controls and asked the twocredit card companies to impose stiffer minimum repayments.    At that timethese two steps were reasonably effective in having a once-for-all effect onconsumer credit.    But since then, the possible forms of consumer credithave widened very considerably because of the Consumer Credit Act, and theissuers of credit cards have proliferated.    Any attempt to repeat the 1973exercise would have had much less effect, mainly diverting credit into otherchannels outside the controls and discriminating against those within theexisting controls.    Indeed, it must be open to doubt whether the two majorcredit card companies. Access and Barclaycard, would have agreed tovoluntary restraint without the requirement being imposed on all issuers ofcredit cards, and on consumer credit generally: the latter would have requiredboth new legislation and a new bureaucratic apparatus to enforce it.15. Last October we took the opportunity of a period of upward pressure onsterling to abolish the remaining exchange controls.    This removed anartificial obstacle to investment overseas and will, over the period of peakNorth Sea oil production, help to build up a stock of profitable assets yieldingan income to the current account of the balance of payments to replace incomefrom North Sea oil when production begins to decline.    Although it was not ourobjective to achieve any particular rate for sterling, the competitiveness ofBritish industry will over time benefit because the exchange rate is likely to belower than it would otherwise have been.    Our manufacturing sector will thusno longer have to take the full force cf the adjustment of our balance ofpayments to increasing North Sea oil production.16. Thr abolition of exchange control has not fundamentally affected ourability to control the domestic money supply.    While domestic and externalfinancial markets have become more closely linked, and there is muchgreater scope for transactions between the two, fiscal and interest rate policywill affect conditions in both domestic and external sterling markets in muchthe same way as they have hitherto influenced the domestic sterling market.It is true that the abolition of exchange controls has increased the potential forevading the scope of direct controls, such as the &quot;corset&quot;, by providinganother route for evasion.    But, as explained above, such direct controlscould not play a significant part anyway: in particular, we could not havecontinued the &quot;corset&quot; for much longer, even if there had been no relaxationof exchange control.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL17. Last summer I instructed the Bank and the Treasury to press ahead inthe stud/ of more effective methods of monetary control.    We shall be issuingshortly a consultative paper about some possible changes, including thequestion of whether it would be desirable to introduce a variant of what iscalled &quot;monetary base control&quot;.    The consultations will help establish whethersuch developments would be likely to provide a quicker, and to some extentmore automatic, method of generating the changes in interest rates which arenecessary to achieve the monetary target: if they were to do so, it mightenable us to secure a smoother path for the growth of the money supply, withan ability to control it over periods of, say, six months rather than theperiod of a year or so which is possible with existing techniques.    It would nothowever remove the need to move interest rates to whatever levels provenecessary - rather the reverse.    The two ways in which the Government cansecure a lower general level of nominal interest rates remain, first tosucceed in its counter-inflation policy, so that the market builds in a smallermargin on account of inflationary expectations, and second to take thenecessary public expenditure and fiscal decisions, so that less of the burdenof monetary control falls on interest rates.CONCLUSIONS18. No-one now disputes that strict monetary control is fundamental toreducing inflationary expectations, defeating inflation itself and creating theright conditions for revitalising the economy.    But the next two year* arecritical.    Both present very severe budgetary problems and it is imperativeto achieve the lower levels of public expenditure I have proposed if we are tostick to our monetary targets and avoid the risk of even higher inteiest ratesand of increasing taxation.    As growth resumes and revenue from North Seaoil increases, we can move towards lower taxes as well as lower interestrates.    But this will only happen if we successfully negotiate the verydifficult period ahead.G HTreasury Chambers22 January 19805CONFIDENTIAL
