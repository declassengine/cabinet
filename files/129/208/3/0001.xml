SECRETUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 3 COPY NO21 January 1980CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITUREMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theChief Secretary, Treasury1. On 13 December 1979 (CC(79) 25th Conclusions, Minute 6) the Cabinetagreed on the need to make further reductions in public expenditure of theorder of  1 billion in 1980-81 and  2 billion in each subsequent year up to1983-84 (in Survey prices) in addition to the seductions from previous plansagreed in the autumn.    In recent weeks public expectations have mounted thatthe reductions to be announced will be substantial, and the implications foreconomic strategy are discussed in a companion paper (C(80) 4).2. The Prime Minister asked all Ministers to re-examine theirprogrammes with the object of finding further savings and Treasury proposalswere made to the relevant Ministers for reductions in some of the majorprogrammes.    The savings so far agreed with the Ministers concerned arelisted at Annex A.    They amount to about  500 million in 1980-81, 1, 350 million in 1981-82, and  1, 450 million in each of the two subsequentyears (all figures in this paper are at 1979 Survey prices).    The bulk of theagreed savings come from the large programmes and the Treasury proposals:with a few exceptions, savings have not been offered elsewhere.3. Some of the agreed savings involve controversial developments ofpolicy: these are summarised in the right-hand column of Annex A. TheMinisters concerned are prepared to accept them, but we draw themspecifically to the Cabinet&apos;s attention.4. The savings in Annex A are not sufficient.    It is now urgent to reachconclusions on larger savings so that the figures for 1980-81 can be settled forannouncement and so that the White Paper covering the full period can bepublished in March.1SECRET
SECRETISSUE FOR DECISION:  CHILD BENEFIT5. There is one specific issue on which we have not been able to reachagreement with the Secretary of State for Social Services and which the Cabinetare asked to decide now.    It concerns child benefit and supplementary benefitchildren&apos;s rates.    On chDd benefit we propose an uprating next Novemberfrom  4 to  4. 50 per week, and a premium of  1 per week for fourth andsubsequent children.    To avoid adding to the &quot;why work?&quot; problem, wepropose a correspondingly lower uprating of supplementary benefit children&apos;srates, which would avoid narrowing the differential between in-work and out-of-work income.    The Secretary of State for Social Services proposes anuprating of  1 in child benefit to  5 par week, which would be close to priceprotection, and full price protection of supplementary benefit children&apos;s rates.The saving from our proposal compared with the Secretary of State&apos;s is:-1980-81    1981-82    1982-83 1983-84Child benefitSupplementary benefit8510210252152522525Consequentials for Northern Irelandexpenditure __3 _6 _7 _798 241 247 257A note at Annex C sets out the considerations in more detail.POINTS TO NOTEEUROPEAN COMMUNITY6. The savings so far discussed do not include a reduction in ourcontribution to the European Community.    We need to take account of theprobability of such a reduction in our view of the public sector borrowingrequirement but it would be unwise to publish expenditure plans implying aspecific degree of success in advance of the negotiations.CASH LIMITS7.        In addition to the specific savings identified in this paper, there willbe a further reduction in the volume of expenditure in 1980-81 if the provisionfor cost increases in cash limits is less than the actual increases. Weshould announce our intention to apply such a squeeze if pay and priceincreases exceed the provision made in cash limits and this will reinforce theother action we are taking to press for greater efficiency.    Since a squeesewill only arise if inflation exceeds our published forecast, there aredifficulties about putting a figure on the consequent saving in expenditure atleast until there is a new economic forecast.    This will need to be consideredin the Budget.2SECRET
SECRETLOCAL AUTHCFTTY MANPOWER8.        The Secretary of State for the Environment has proposed, as analternative to reductions in housing on top of those in Anne:- A so far agreed,that local authorities in England and Wales should be asked to make anadditional saving from 1981-82 representing a further cumulative 1 per centannual reduction in their current expenditure (mainly manpower) in all services.The Secretary of State for the Environment suggested that, if such savings,additional to the other agreed reductions, could be achieved on all theprogrammes, the savings produced would be:- i1980-81    1981-82    1982-83 1983-845 million 1979 Survey prices - 120 240 360There would be further proportionate savings in Scotland and Northern Ireland.9 However, colleagues have already agreed to reductions in total localauthority current expenditure (England and Wales - excluding housing) asfollows:-1978-79    1980-81    1981-82    1982-83 1983-84  million 1979 Survey prices     12,279      12,014      11,816      11,698 11,598% change on 1978-79 -2.2 -3.8 -4.7 -5.5Programme details, and estimates of manpower implications, are beingcirculated separately.    This shows that substantial manpower savings will berequired for all the main local authority programmes, except the police andthe personal social services.    Central Government has no direct means ofsecuring reductions in local authority manpower.    To achieve these furthersavings, colleagues responsible for local authority programmes would need toconsider whether further reductions related to manpower could realistically besecured, whether through increased efficiency or further policy changes. Tothe extent that such further cuts cannot be counted on, we shall need to look forfurther real reductions, and in particular to look for further savings on thehousing programme beyond those referred to in paragraph 11 below.CIVIL SERVICE AND OTHER MANPOWER COSTS10.       Whether or not the Secretary of State for the Environment&apos;s proposal inparagraph 8 is adopted, it is necessary to consider what more to do aboutmanpower costs in the Civil Service, health service, universities and othergroups.    The most appropriate instrument for securing early economies inthis context is a renewed general squeeze through cash limits, which act moredirectly on these groups than on the local authorities.    We and the Minister ofState, Civil Service Department, expect such a squeeze to occur through theSECRET
SECRET1980-81 cash limits.    These reductions can then be carried forward to thelater years.    On top of the reductions in Civil Service manpower of 20, 000{Z\ per cent) in 1979-80 and a further 39, 000 (5 per cent) announced by theLord President of the Council on 6 December following the &quot;options&quot; exercisecarried out last year, the squeeze on the Health Service and universitiesresulting from this year&apos;s cash limits and the Clegg reports, and on Quangosthrough the Pliatzky Report, this amounts to a significant programme ofreductions in public service manpower.HOUSINGU.        The Secretary of State for the Environment would prefer not to be boundby a final decision now on the method by which he should achieve the savings towhich he has agreed for the years after 1980-81.    The savings in 1980-81 willbe achieved by 60p a week on rents from October (additional to the  1. 50 aweek from April already announced) plus reduced funds for insulation and cutsto reflect the further decline in new housebuilding approvals. However,colleagues will want to be aware of the broad methods of achieving the savingsin later years.    These could include a similar annual level of cash rentincreases and of new housebuilding together with a reduction in the HousingCorporation programme.    Alternatives could be produced by higher (or lower)rent increases and correspondingly lower (or higher) cuts in capital.DEFENCE12. It is an important question what scope there is for a contribution fromspecific savings on the defence budget.    This is being discussed separatelywith the Secretary of State for Defence.EDUCATION13. The reductions shown in Annex A have been agreed in bilateraldiscussion between Treasury Ministers and the Secretary of State for Educationand Science and represent the largest reductions which the Secretary of Statefeels able to make in addition to the cuts agreed in the autumn.    However, itis right to report to Cabinet that the group of other Ministers who took part indiscussion of the environment and social security cuts - the Home Secretary,the Secretary of State for Industry and the Secretary of State for Employment 4as well as the Secretaries of State for the Environment and for Social Servicesconsider that there is scope for further savings in the education programmefrom improving efficiency in the main area of primary and secondaryeducation.EMPLOYMENT14.       Any addition to the employment programmes on account of the specialemployment measures discussed in the Secretary of State for the ffny^n tpaper would be an offset to the reductions in this paper.    We have toSECRET
SECRETrecommend that *here should be no addition to the Secretary of State&apos;sprogramme after deduction of the agreed savings in Anne:: A.RESULTING FIGURES15. Annex B summarises the broad expenditure totals which would emergeon the assumption that the Cabinet adopt our proposals in paragraph 5 and theSecretary of State for the Environment&apos;s proposal on local authority manpoweror alternative reductions of similar amount.    Subject to further refinementby Departments, these would be the figures to be published in the furtherpublic expenditure White Paper scheduled for March.CONCLUSION16. We invr&apos;te the Cabinet:-i. To agree the savings listed in Arnex A.ii. To decide the outstanding issues on child benefit andsupplementary benefit children&apos;s rates in paragraph 5.iii. To note the points in paragraphs 6-15, and that we hope to reportback to Cabinet, in the light of our discussion of this paper, with aview to reaching final decisions on outstanding issues on 31 January.G HJ BTreasury Chambers21 January 1980SECRET

ANNEX COTE ON THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROPOSALSote by the Secretary of State for Social Services on the agreed proposals.he first agreed proposal is to abolish Earnings Related Supplement to unemployment,ickness, maternity and injury benefit, and to   widows&apos; allowance.   This wouldbutliminate entitlement on average:   of  11 per week,,up to  17,for 500,000 peoplet any one time (people on a spell of benefit at abolition would continue toeceive benefit until that spell ended).   The   Secretary of State accepts thatAbolition needs to take place in January 1981 in order to obtain the substantialpaving required in the year 1981-82.   Whilst the abolition of any insurancebenefit linked with past contributions is bound to &apos;be intensely controversial,in the case of EES,contributions are being paid in 1979-80 for title to benefitthroughout   .1981   and withdrawal of benefit in January 1981 is therefore opento additional attack as a breach of contract.   Deferment to January 1982 wouldreduce criticism.12.   The second agreed proposal is that the November 1980uprating for the flatrate benefit paid to the groups of people referred to above, and for those onLong term invalidity benefit, should be 10 per cent less than needed to keeppace with prices (ie if price protection needed 15 per cent, the uprating wouldae 5 per cent).   One ground for this is that these benefits should be subject toincome tax but it is not yet possible to tax them.5.   The Secretary of State believes this to be as fierce a package as it ispossible to sustain politically.   It involves the first ever abolition of abenefit and the first time since the thirties that the real value of an incomemaintenance benefit has deliberately been cut.   Nevertheless the Secretary ofState accepts that in present circumstances the savings must be found.|Views of the Secretary of State and the Chancellor on the points at issue.The Secretary of State considers child benefit, which needs to go up bymore than  1 in November just to keep pace with prices since April 1979 should be raised across the board from  4 to  5.   The importance of childbenefit to the incentives equation is that social security benefits are reduced1.SECRET
SECRETby its value while the worker has the benefit in addition to wages.   There arealso now no child tax allowances and child benefit is the only significantmeans by which help may be given to the family man above the poverty line. Ifpersonal tax allowances are price protected and child benefit not, the familyman with children is singled out for unfavourable treatment.5.   Even if less than full price protection were given to child benefit theSecretary of State does not consider that there should be any cut in the basicsubsistence level for children on short term supplementary benefit.   Of the\ million children involved, 300,000 are in one-parent families or familiesof the sick, for whom the incentives argument is not relevant.   The effectwould therefore be small in relation to the total &quot;why work&quot; problem any way,and the political difficulties of selecting the childrens rates for cuts areobvious.   Moreover such cuts would run entirely counter to the Government&apos;sdeclared policy now being implemented in the Social Security Bill now beforeParliament, to switch supplementary benefit resources towards families withchildren on supplementary benefit because they of all groups find it mostdifficult to manage.6.   The Chancellor&apos;s view as to child benefit is that an increase of as muchas  1 is not justifiable in current circumstances.   Price protection is notrequired either by statute or by custom, and it is most undesirable to extendindexation.   The benefit itself goes indiscriminately to all with children,whether they are rich or poor;   the arguments about poverty and incentivesapply to only a minority of recipients and would be met in part by the proposedpremium for the 4th and subsequent child.   So far as supplementary benefit goes,the Chancellor thinks that as a consequence of less than full price protectionof child benefit childrens scale rates must be held back in the interests ofwork incentives, in the same way that broadly similar steps have already beenagreed in respect of child dependency allowances payable with sickness andunemployment benefit.   He notes that supplementary benefit levels are otherwisevirtually untouched.
