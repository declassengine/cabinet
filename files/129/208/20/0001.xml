RESTRICTEDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 20COPY NO     &gt; O13 March 1980CABINETDISPERSAL OF CIVIL SERVICE POSTS TO SCOTLANDMemorandum by the Minister of State, Civil Service Department1. Under the revised dispersal programme agreed by Cabinet last July(CC(79) 12th Conclusions, Minute 4) and announced in Parliament, it wasdecided that at least 2, 000 Civil Service posts were to be dispersed toScotland in the next few years.    There is great political pressure inScotland to send at least this number, and assurances have frequently beengiven by Ministers in public, and also in private to our Scottish backbenchers.2. The 2, 900 or so posts were to be made up of 1,400 posts from theMinistry of (Defence (MOD) to Glasgow and 650 from the OverseasDevelopment Administration (ODA) to East Kilbride.    The MOD posts arenot due to go to Glasgow until the mid-l980s, so there is even moreimportance to be attached to the East Kilbride posts which are due to bedispersed in 1980-81.    In effect, the East Kilbride posts are the onlyCivil Service posts due to be transferred to Scotland during the lifetime ofthis Parliament.    The Secretary of State for Scotland tells me that as aresult it is politically essential for him both for the numbers to be 650 andmat we should keep as closely as possible to the announced timetable.3. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has now minuted the PrimeMinister, on 22 February, that it is no longer possible for the ODA to sendmore than between 400 and 450  posts owing to cuts in numbers and organisa-tional changes.    The Prime Minister has asked me to put forward someoptions to my colleagues as to how we should deal with this problem.OPTIONS4. a.    We could reduce the number of posts to be dispersed to theGlasgow area including East Kilbride.    If we decide on that course,that is the end of the matter.    But for political reasons in Scotlandand in the House of Commons, I strongly advise against this.If this option is unrealistic, as I believe, then we must either:-b. Find further posts from ODA and/or the Foreign andCommonwealth Office to take up the shortfall, orc. Make up the shortfall with numbers from other departments.1RESTRICTED
RESTRICTEDFURTHER DISPERSAL FROM ODA OR FCO5. The ODA&apos;s staff complement is some 2, 500 posts including 1,400Headquarters posts (of which 70 are located overseas).    It has firespecialist units including the Directorate of Overseas Surveys (DOS). TheForeign and Commonwealth Secretary has circulated a paper about the DOS(C(80) 19).    It was intended originally to disperse the DOS to the Glasgowarea.    But last year we did not include it in the revised dispersalprogramme because of the cost of special accommodation, the prospect ofwholesale resignations and the expected decline in demand for its services.It was said that the unit had already lost 20 per cent of its output due toresignations of specialist staff attributed to the prospect of dispersal. Thecost of the special accommodation would now be some  3.4 million for which,as I tauteritand it, the Property Services Agency (PSA) has made noprovision.6. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and ODA are now to merge.1, 600 FCO posts are in fact filled by Home Civil Servants.    Our predecessorshad planned to send 300 FCO posts to Merseyside.    Last year the Foreignand Commonwealth Secretary agreed that this would be unreasonable, amongother reasons because there was no self-contained element that could behived off; a high proportion of posts was filled by members of the DiplomaticService; and it was unreasonable to further disperse a Department alreadyspread over 120 countries.7. The Overseas Development Administration&apos;s other specialist units areCentre for Overseas Pest Research (170 posts); Land ResourcesDevelopment Centre (110); Tropical Products Institute (390), and PopulationBureau (6).    I am told that none of these is suitable for dispersal. Somewould require  the provision of costly laboratories and all have close linkswith institutions in the South.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretarycould give more information as to what effect a move to Scotland would have,in particular, on the Tropical Products Institute.OTHER DEPARTMENTS8. We have had endless trouble in attempting to find a dispersalpackage for Merseyside from other Departments.    The MOD is alreadysending 1, 400 posts to Glasgow from London.    I am told that, to findlarger numbers, MOD would have to look for posts from outside London*If that is really so, then it would be undesirable.9. It is conceivably possible that other Departments who were at onestage proposing to disperse to Merseyside or elsewhere could now send acontingent to Scotland.    These included Inland Revenue, PSA, Home Officeand Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.    My colleagues responsiblefor those Departments will know whether this is a possible course.    But Isuspect that this would cause them just as much trouble as present planswill cause the ODA.    I doubt too if such a move could be achieved as quicklyas the present programme.2RESTRICTED
RESTRICTEDCONCLUSION10.      I advise my colleagues to reject Option a.    If that is agreed, then,unless colleagues are prepared to provide posts for dispersal to make goodthe ODA&apos;s shortfall as in Option c., I see no alternative to Option b.  - i.e.to ask the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to make good the shortfallfrom the merged Departments of the FCO/ODA.P CCivil Service Department13 March 19803RESTRICTED
