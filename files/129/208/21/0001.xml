CONFIDENTIALCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80)21COPY NO13 March 1980CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME:CONTEMPT OF COURT BILLMemorandum by the Lord Chancellor1. The need for the Cabinet to discuss the legislative programmearises in part from the failure by Legislation Committee on 11 March toagree that the Lord Advocate and I should now introduce the Cont empt ofCourt Bill.    The Cabinet should know why I attach importance to this beingdone.2. We are deeply committed to proceeding with this Bill, not only bythe explicit promise in The Queen&apos;s Speech (a promise which has beenpublicly renewed from time to time in recent months), but also by our inter-national obligations under the European Human Rights Convention, asdeclared by the Court of Human Rights in the Sunday Times case in Anril 1979.The Bill is eagerly awaited in certain quarters, both in Parliament andoutside, notably by the Press and broadcasting media, who have long beenurging implementation of the Phillimore Report of 1974, on which the Billis based.   Anything short of a determined effort to get this Bill on to theStatute Book this Session would rightly be regarded by them as a seriousfailure by the Government.    The heavy criticism which our predecessorsincurred on this score has been muted since the Election by our promise tolegislate this Session: it would revive with redoubled force if we were torenege on that promise.    A further measure of urgency is added by the needto deal with jury secrecy, following the decision in the recent New Statesmancase.3. The Bill will be generally welcomed.    Some may say that it shouldgo further than it does, but I do not expect great controversy, and any thatthere is will not be on Party lines.    Therefore although there will inevitablybe a certain amount of discussion, the Bill need not take up a large amountof Parliamentary time, and especially not in the Lords, which is where thepresent difficulties mainly arise.    The Bill is quite short (19 clauses and4 schedules: 16 pages in all); and it is ready for immediate introduction.It has no manpower, and only insignificant expenditure, implications.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. This is therefore a Bill for which the Government will get littlecriticism and some credit for introducing, but much criticism for not_intro-ducing.    It is the only significant Bill in the whole programme which in anyway deal8 (at least as far as England and Wales are concerned) with law andorder - a subject by which we set a good deal of store at the Election. Thepublication of a White Paper would not be an adequate substitute for the Bill:the Labour Government&apos;s Green Paper of 1978 evoked little but well-meritedrebukes for failure to take legislative action.    I accept that, at this stage ofan exceptionally crowded Session, the Bill&apos;s chances of getting through areuncertain.    But I have no doubt that in this particular case it would be betterto introduce the Bill and take it as far as possible than not to introduce it atall.H of St. MHouse of Lords13 March 19802CONFIDENTIAL
