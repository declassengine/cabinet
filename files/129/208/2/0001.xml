THIRD REPORT FROM THE SELECT COMMITTEEON THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONERFOR ADMINISTRATIONSESSION 1977-78Observations by the GovernmentIntroductory1. This White Paper contains the Government&apos;s response to a number ofobservations and recommendations made in the Select Committee&apos;s ThirdReport for Session 1977-78*.Interest on tax paid late2. In paragraphs 9-11 of their Report the Select Committee recommendedcertain changes in the arrangements for payment of interest on tax paid late.3. The Government accept in principle the case for two changes recommendedin paragraph 9 of the Report first, that the de minimis limit for charging interestshould be raised from  10 to  20; and second, that the statutory date whenpayment of tax on taxed income assessments is due should be made later.4. A difficulty about the recommended six months&apos; deferral of tax which isnow due on 6 July is that it would then become due for payment in the followingJanuary, a time of year when there is already a substantial flow of tax to theExchequer. Adding to receipts then would present extra problems for the manage-ment of the money market and for achieving an acceptable pattern for themoney supply in the first quarter of the year. The Government therefore proposeinstead that the statutory payment date should be changed to 1 December, adeferral of five months. With that modification, the Government are ready at anappropriate time to introduce the legislation which would be needed to implementthese recommendations. The Government consider that it would be reasonableto take that opportunity to make a similar change in the due date also 6 Julyat present for payment of capital gains tax.5. The Government recognise the importance of explaining the rules aboutinterest adequately, and they note the Select Committee&apos;s welcome in paragraph9 of their Report for the steps which the Inland Revenue have already takenwith a view to widening taxpayers&apos; awareness of the interest provisions andtheir understanding of them. The Government note that in paragraph 9 of theirReport the Committee also expressed the view that the rate of interest chargedon arrears of tax should be revised more frequently and added the suggestionof a link with Minimum Lending Rate. The Government recognise the im-portance of keeping the rate under regular review, but in considering howresponsive it ought to be to changes in interest rates generally they think thatweight must also be given to the greater convenience that a reasonably stablerate represents for taxpayers and orderly administration alike. For the future, the* HC 544, 295.3
Government will continue to have regard to the need to keep a balance betweenconvenience and the maintenance of a sensible relationship with market ratesgenerally in the interests of both the individual taxpayer and the public purse.6. The Government note the Select Committee&apos;s criticism in paragraph 10 oftheir Report of the argument that the present interest provisions achieveequity between the taxpayer and the public purse by neutralising the advantageto the taxpayer who pays late; the Committee felt that there is a penal effectbecause the interest charge is often greater than the net after-tax yield of theincome that the taxpayer would have got from investing the unpaid tax. Theincidence of interest payable on arrears of tax ought, however, also to be seenagainst the background of the general non-deductibility for tax purposes ofinterest on borrowing. The Government are reviewing the rules for charginginterest on unpaid tax, as well as those relating to the repayments supplement,in the light of the Select Committee&apos;s comments.7. The Government note that the Committee have accepted that it would beimpracticable to correct the imbalance between the starting date for calculatinginterest on tax paid late and that for calculating the repayment supplement(paragraph 11). The Committee suggested that the effects of this differencecould be mitigated by using a higher rate of interest for the repayment supple-ment. This would, in the Government&apos;s view, serve to increase the dissatisfactionof those who, because they receive repayment within twelve months of the endof the year of assessment, get no supplement. The accompanying arbitary adjust-ment in favour of those already entitled to a supplement would provide verylittle compensation to those whose supplement covered only a month or two,while giving too much to those whose supplement covered a period of, say, twoor three years. The Government will, however, reconsider the point in their reviewof interest rules and the repayment supplement.The complexity of the social security system8. In paragraphs 12-18 of their Report the Select Committee drew attentionto the view of the Parliamentary Commissioner that it was the complexity of thesocial security system itself which gave rise to many of the complaints madeagainst the Department of Health and Social Security. The Committee urgedthe Government to take full note of his observations and to accelerate consider-ation of ways of removing the cause of so many grievances.9. The Department note the Select Committee&apos;s views about the need topersist in efforts to simplify the whole structure of social security benefits, towhich this Government are committed. The factors giving rise to complexity are,as explained in evidence to the Committee, difficult to overcome in manyrespects, but a number of major simplifications have nevertheless been achievedin recent years. Efforts to this end continue. In particular a report of a com-prehensive review of the Supplementary Benefits Scheme was published as aconsultative document in July 1978. The background papers prepared for thereview are also available to the public and interested bodies, and individualshave thus been enabled to comment before decisions are taken about changes inthe Scheme. Many of the possible changes outlined, such as the simplest possible4
rules for assessing a claimant&apos;s resources and a clearer legal structure for theScheme with less reliance on discretion, are aimed at making the Scheme easierto understand and administer. The Secretary of State published on 29 November1979 a Social Security Bill, one of the main purposes of which was to embark onthe first stage of reforms to simplify the Supplementary Benefits Scheme. Withinthe Department there is also a continuous quest for simplification. Between1974 and 1979 a joint working party of Staff Side and Official Side represen-tatives reviewed the scope for simplifying work and procedures and has dealtwith over 2,000 suggestions from both staff and line management. This is againstthe background of other long established methods, such as the use of Manage-ment Services reviews and through the staff suggestions scheme.10. Taking into account the difficulties recognised by the Committee, theDepartment see no present prospect of enabling the public to deal with onlyone office over all aspects of social security benefits. But they have noted theCommittee&apos;s views and, in so far as practical considerations allow, will continueto move as rapidly as possible towards a more fully integrated system.11. The process of examining and improving leaflets and other communi-cations to the public from all points of view purpose, clarity, brevity, accuracyand so on is continuous. By way of illustration, supplementary benefit leafletsissued in late 1977 (as reported in evidence to the Select Committee), althoughfound by claimants to be an improvement over previous versions, have beenfurther revised and simplified with the help of outside bodies. Some DHSSpublications are produced with both the public and advisory groups in mind,such as Which Benefit, The Supplementary Benefit Handbook and the periodicalSupplementary Benefit Notes and News. On occasions leaflets have been producedto meet short-term advisory needs, for instance for doctors in explanation ofAttendance Allowance. On the whole, however, the Department consider thatthere is more to be gained by concentrating on improved leaflets which will betterserve the needs of both claimants and advisory bodies than by increasing thealready extensive range of leaflets now available.&quot;A War Pensions Injustice Remedied&quot;12. In paragraphs 19-21 of their Report the Select Committee referred to theParliamentary Commissioner&apos;s report, &quot;A War Pensions Injustice Remedied&quot;.They welcomed assurances on behalf of the Department of Health and SocialSecurity that everything possible would be done to ensure that nothing of thiskind could occur again, and trusted that the Department would do all they couldto trace any similar cases.13. The then Secretary of State&apos;s decision to refer the original case to theDirector of Public Prosecutions led to a police investigation. Following this, theDirector decided that no proceedings should be instituted. The Secretary ofState made a statement about this outcome in reply to a Parliamentary Questionon 13 November 1978 (Official Report, Volume 958, Written Answers, cols. 71-2).He made it clear that he strongly condemned the decisions which had led to thiscomplaint. He did not propose further disciplinary action at that stage, buthad taken steps to ensure that all concerned were aware of the gravity of the5
matter and that the lessons to be learned had been brought forcefully to theattention of officials currently engaged on social security administration.14. The Department have continued their efforts to trace any other officers whomight be in a similar position to the one whose case was dealt with in the Comm-issioner&apos;s report. As the Committee suggested, the Department approached themain ex-Service organisations to seek their co-operation in identifying cases.Including the one dealt with in the report, a total of 59 cases have now beenidentified. In 35 of these no rank addition at all had been awarded; in theremaining 24 the position had previously been corrected back to October 1974but payments for rank addition were due for an earlier period, back to the date ofthe officers&apos; termination of service. Payment of the arrears due and of compen-sation for the delay has been or is being made in all these cases.15. The wider implications for departments of the administration of legalentitlements have been examined in a Government report, Legal Entitlementsand Administrative Practices, published in December 1979*.Compensation for delayed payments or repayments16. The Select Committee referred in paragraphs 22-26 of their Report to therecommendation in their First Report for Session 1974-751 that the recipientshould in principle be given some compensation where payments or repaymentshave been unduly delayed through no fault of his, and to the then Government&apos;sundertaking in replyj to consider individual cases involving departmental erroron their merits. They drew attention to a case in which delay occurred which wasneither the fault of the recipient nor attributable to departmental error, andurged the Government to extend the payment of compensation to cases in whichthe recipient has suffered significant financial loss as the result of a prolongeddelay for which he was not to blame.17. The Government cannot accept a general obligation to pay compensationwhere there is no departmental error or omission, and the Committee haveacknowledged that they do not expect interest to be paid in every instance. Theamount of time required for adequate consideration of claims for payments orrepayments will vary widely depending on the circumstances of each case, andcompensation would not be appropriate in respect of such periods. Nor couldsuch an obligation be accepted where delay is the fault of third parties. But theGovernment do accept that individual cases may arise where recipients ofbenefits or grants sustain significant financial loss as a result of prolonged delaysfor which neither the recipient nor the Department is to blame, and where thecircumstances call for sympathetic treatment. These might include cases in whichdelay was attributable to mental illness on the part of the claimant. Depart-ments will be prepared to consider the possibility of ex gratia payments in suchcases.* HMSO, price  1.t HC 454, paragraph 21.i Grind, 6442, paragraph 9.6
