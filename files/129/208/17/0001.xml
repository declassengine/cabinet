CONFIDENTIALCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 1711 March 1980CABINETCOPY NO82MEDIUM TERM FINANCIAL STRATEGYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. The economic outlook is difficult whatever policy we follow. Butthere is general agreement that the immediate imperative is to bring downinflation.    And there is general agreement too that, although other policiesare very important, proper monetary control is central to the battleagainst inflation.2. Since the Election we have only succeeded in stopping the rot weinherited.    To achieve positive success our policies must do more. Thebusiness world, financial institutions, labour markets and ordinary people(particularly Government supporters) must have a vision of how we intendto proceed hereafter.    They want to know the course we intend to steer inrelation to expenditure and taxes, and what our commitment to monetarydiscipline might mean.    Furthermore, the way the policy works impliesthat they need to be given a clear indication of the limits within which weintend to manage public spending and the money supply, so that they canadjust their behaviour rationally to fit in with those limits.    But they alsoneed a demonstration that our intentions and the policies which will realisethem are consistent, technically sound, and will bear fruit.3. We need, therefore, to illustrate the modest realism of our goalsand to marshal the wider support which will follow from so doing. Themore we do so the more we can hope to get into the virtuous circle inwhich g.eater confidence in our policies makes them more effective andtheir effectiveness increases their credibility.4. The further public expenditure reductions we have now made,together with the likely revenue from the North Sea, make a substantialdifference to the prospect.    Although the next two years are still likely tobe tight, there should be growing room for manoeuvre thereafter. Theprospect of a steady and significant decline over the medium term in thePublic Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), interest rates and taxationis now a real one.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. I prepose, therefore, to re-state in the Budget our commitment totargets for declining monetary growth over the medium term, indicating atarget range of 4 - 8 per cent for 1983-84.    Many people believe - and Iagree with them - that setting figures to our intentions will have a significantand useful effect on expectations.6. To show how falling monetary growth can be achieved at the same timeas lower interest rates and substantial progress towards our tax objectives,I shall provide some illustrative figures in the Financial Statement andBudget Report.    These will rest on the agreed public expenditure totals andmake the deliberately cautious assumption that the average growth rate ofthe ecenomy over the period 1980-1983 could be about the same as the1 per cent a year recorded for the period 1973-79.    Given the generalexpectation of a fall in output in 1980 this implies a significant ra ov$ry inoutput over the latter part of the period, and a decent rate of growth ofGross Domestic Product (GDP) by its end.7. The following summary table indicates what I have in mind.    But thefigures which are on a price basis consistent with the Public ExpenditureWhite Paper to be published on Budget Day, are at this stage still provisionaland will need to take account of the Budget decisions.PUBLIC SECTOR BORROWING1978-79 Prices (  billion)1978-79  1979-80  1980-81   1981-82  1982-83 1983-84Total Expenditure	73.8	75	73|	721	70	69!Total Receipts	64. 7	66	67|	661	68	70!Implied Fiscal						Adjustment	0	0	0	0		-41PSBR*	9.3	*	* 	H	41	J 2(PSBR as % of GDP						at market prices)	fill	(4|)	(4)	(31)	(2*)	(2.0)?Assuming that present direct and indirect tax rates and allowancesare increased in line with inflation.It will be seen that the table contains what is called a &apos;fiscal adjustment&apos;.This is the change in Government revenue necessary to reach a PSBRconsistent with the money supply target and lower interest rates. Thefigures suggest scope for substantial reductions in the real burden of taxesin the last 2 years.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL8. Such projections are subject to wide margins of error.    Even if weknew about developments in the economy generally, it would be difficult topredict revenue and expenditure with any precision.    We all hope that theoutturn may be better, and to that end we have erred on the side of cautionwherever possible.    It would, of course, be imprudent to count on a betteroutcome in advance.    If even the modest growth I have assumed were notachieved in the event, fiscal and other policies would need to be adaptedto secure our monetary and inflation objectives.9. I should, however, warn that the prospect for unemployment isworrying, whatever policy is followed.    The cautious growth assumptionprobably implies some increase beyond the levels stated as workingassumptior.s in the forthcoming White Paper,   But I am clear that this riskis unavoidable whatever strategy we adopt*    Although slacker fiscal andmonetary policies might improve the prospect in the very short run it wouldbe at the cost of higher inflation and still worse unemployment before long.10. It would be damaging to publish these projections if they showedprospects for the PSBR and taxes which seemed inconsistent with ourmonetary objectives.    But with the expenditure reductions we have recentlyagreed the &apos;ramework of the strategy has taken convincing shape. Nearlyall the information we propose to publish hai, as a rule, been included inrecent public spending White Papers.    There is a widespread hope that weshall publish our strategy - and, by the same token, a risk that failure to doso will be deemed an admission of defeat.    Moreover much, perhaps all, ofthe information is bound to become public anyway, if only as a result ofpressure from the new Treasury Committee.    I believe it would be right totake the initiative in presenting it in a convincing framework.11. In short, I believe that we should show the country, and in particularthe financial, business and industrial communities, some of the foundationsof our overall economic strategy in a coherent framework covering the life-time of the present Parliament.    In this way we shall be better able toachieve understanding of and support for the necessarily stringent policieswe must continue to pursue for some time to come.12. I invite my colleagues to endorse these proposals.G HTreasury Chambers10 March 19803CONFIDENTIAL
