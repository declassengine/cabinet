CONFIDENTIALIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 114 January 1980DEPARTMENTAL SELECT COMMITTEESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster1. Cabinet accepted in principle last June the recommendations of theSelect Committee on Procedure to establish Select Committees related toDepartments (CC(79) 6th Conclusions, Minute 5).    The Committees havenow begun work and their early meetings have raised some issues which havebeen brought to my attention by my colleagues.    These are summarised inthe Annex.    We need to agree the line we should take about -a. the wish of Select Committees to examine matters coveredby current legislation or otherwise likely to be debated in theHouse;b. requests for evidence that would disclose advice given toMinisters;c. queries concerning the &quot;associated public bodies&quot; intowhose activities the Committees may enquire.EXAMINATION OF MATTERS INCLUDED IN LEGISLATION2. The Secretary of State for the Environment draws attention in hisletter of 12 December (copied to Cabinet colleagues) to problems which mightarise if Select Committees investigate topics that are the subject of currentlegislation.3. In particular he draws attention to the difficulties that would arise ifSelect Committee and Standing Committee investigations and proceedingstake place simultaneously.    This issue is about to arise with theEnvironment Committee and the Standing Committee on the Housing Bill.The Secretary of State suggests that no attempt should be made to get theCommittee to abandon their proposed investigation, but that they should beasked to adjust the timing of their programme to avoid simultaneousconsideration in the Select Committee and in the Commons Standing CommitteeCOPY NOCABINET1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4* The Procedure Committee were agreed that Bills should notnormally be referred to Select Committees, but their views on how farthese Committees should go in considering proposals for legislation are notaltogether clear.    They recommended, however, that the role of StandingCommittees should be extended to enable the &quot;factual and technical back-ground&quot; to Bills to be examined in additional sessions before clause-by-clause examination.    This latter proposal has yet to be considered, but ishardly consistent with the examination of Bill proposals by SelectCommittees,    We are not, of course, committed to the ProcedureCommittee&apos;s recommendation, on which I will be consulting Cabinetcolleagues later this session,5, My conclusion is that we should seek to discourage Select Committeesfrom examining matters covered by bills while they are at the StandingCommittee stage,OTHER MATTERS TO BE DEBATED IN PARLIAMENT36, The Select Committee on Scottish Affairs (Annex, paragraph^ hastaken evidence on the Rate Support Grant (Scotland) Order, for which theGovernment will shortly seek an affirmative resolution.    The EmploymentCommittee is seeking to examine the law on trade union immunities (Annex,paragraplv^) on which the Government are considering provisions in thecurrent Bill.    Select Committees will in future undoubtedly seek to considerproposals in White Papers or Gzeen Papers and on a host of matters onwhich Parliamentary debate will take place subsequently.7, I propose that  tne Government should not seek to discourage SelectCommittee examination of topics dealt with in current delegated legislationor in White Papers,    Where the subject is highly controversial,Departmental Ministers, rather than officials, could give evidence to SelectCommittees in advance of debate on the floor of the House,ADVICE TO MINISTERS8, The Home Affairs Committee (Annex, paragraph 5) wish to find outwhat legal advice was given to Ministers about the new immigration rules.This request raises both special and general issues.    The doctrine thatadvice given by the Law Officers is not disclosed is well established. Thereis no special policy about the advice of Departmental legal staff.    It iscovered by the general rule that advice from officials to Ministers shouldnever be disclosed.    This is set out in the Memorandum of Guidance toOfficials appearing before Select Committees, which has recently beenrevised and which, subject to the agreement of Cabinet colleagues, I proposeto circulate to the Liaison Committee for information.    There may never-theless be increasing pressure for officials to say what advice they havetendered, and whether it was accepted.    I propose that we should stand bythe doctrine that the internal proceedings of Government should not bedisclosed to the House or otherwise be made public.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALASSOCIATED PUBLIC BODIES9. The Select Committees have been given very general terms   reference - &quot;To examine the expenditure, administration and policy of theirrespective Departments and associated public bodies&quot;.    This was in linewith the recommendations of the Procedure Committee.   At least oneCommittee (Annex, paragraph 6) has sought the views of Departments aboutthe public bodies which in their view come within the definition.10. I indicated to the House in the procedure debate last June mat anassociated public body was &quot;one for which there was a significant degree ofMinisterial responsibility&quot;.    I suggest that in preparing a responseDepartments should take into account the lists of bodies set out in the WhitePaper on Non-Departmental Public Bodies (the Pliatzky Report) and theextent to which Ministers answer Questions about bodies of this kind inParliament.    In the last resort, it must be for the Select Committeesthemselves, subject to the authority of the House, to interpret their terms ofreference.    If, in the event, a Select Committee decides to investigate aparticular associated public body, it would be open to Ministers to refuseInformation about that body when disclosure would not be in the publicinterest, and where refusal could be justified to Parliament as a whole.HANDLING11. The normal point of contact between the Government and SelectCommittees has been the Leader of the House and a Liaison Committeecomprising Select Committee chairmen.    I hope that a new LiaisonCommittee, on the lines recommended by the Procedure Committee, will beestablished by resolution later this month.    I propose to seek an earlymeeting with the chairman of the Committee to discuss the issues in thismemorandum in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s conclusions.    Meanwhile, it maybe necessary for Ministers or their Departments to discuss these matterswith individual Select Committees.    If they run into difficulty in gainingacceptance of our conclusions, they might ask the Committees to deferaction on areas of controversy until mere has been an opportunity fordiscussion collectively with chairmen in the Liaison Committee.CONCLUSIONS12. In summary, I propose that we should -a. seek to discourage Departmental Select Committees fromexamining matters covered by bills which are before a StandingCommittee;b. take no action to discourage discussion by SelectCommittees of other matters which may shortly be debated ineither House;3CONFIDENTIAL

The Secretary of State for the Environment reports in his.etter of 12 December (previously circulated) that the Environment&apos;ommittee are proposing to enquire into the future of the rentedlousing sector and, in particular, to take&apos;early evidence onthe financial and social implications of the sale of councilmouses.     Major provisions concerning the sale of council housesare included in the Housing Bill, which will shortly have itsSecond Reading and will be referred to Standing Committee beforethe end of February.(a) The question is whether simultaneous considerationwith Commons Standing Committee can be avoided.^What view should be taken of the request for evidence?Scottish Affairs Committee3. The Select   Committee on Scottish Affairs took evidence fromofficials on 19 December on the question of rate support grant,with particular reference to the economic assumptions underlyingthe 1980-81 settlement (eg anticipated wage costs, inflationrates, etc).     The relevant Affirmative Order is to be debatedCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALin January.     It is understood that the Committee regarded thesession as educative in preparation for the debate on the Floorof the House.     The nature and tone of the questioning generallyreflected this intention.(b) Should evidence in future be given on matters whichare the subject of statutory instruments awaitingParliamentary debate?Employment Committee4. The Employment Committee wish to consider the legalimmunities of trade unions.     Written evidence has been requestedby 21 January with a view to meeting in private on 30 Januaryto consider the course of the enquiry.     This subject is not atpresent dealt with directly in the Employment Bill, though itis relevant to the provision on picketing.     The Secretary ofState for Employment proposes to seek the agreement of hiscolleagues at E Committee on 15 January to the inclusion in theBill of amendments about trade union immunities.(c) This extends question (a) to matters on which.theGovernment have announced their intention tointroduce a Bill before Parliament.Home Affairs Committee5. The Committee has set up a Sub-Committee on Race Relationsand Immigration. it has decided to undertake a short enquiryinto the legal implications, with respect to the European2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALConvention on Human Rights, of the proposed new immigrationrules.     The Sub-Committee asked for evidence from Home Office[fficials, accompanied if possible by one of the Law OfficersIr their officials.     Home Office officials, including membersof the Home Office Legal Advisers Branch (but not the LawOfficers or their officials) gave evidence on 2o December. TheBub-Committee appear to be anxious to establish what legaladvice was given to Ministers about any possible conflict betweenthe proposed new immigration rules and the European Convention,but no information has been given to them on this point.(d) The first issue is the confidentiality of theopinions of the Law Officers; and the second iswhether the advice of officials (including legaladvice) to Ministers should remain &quot;confidential.[Treasury and Civil Service Committee16.   The Treasury and the Civil Service Department have been[asked on behalf of the Select Committee which public bodiesthey regard as covered by the phrase &quot;associated public bodies&quot;[in the Committee&apos;s terms of reference.(e) How should Departments respond when faced withsuch questions?7.
