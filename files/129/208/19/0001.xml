CONFIDENTIALCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 19 COPY NO 8212 March 1980CABINETDISPERSAL TO EAST KILBRIDEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign andCommonwealth Affairs1. The Prime Minister has asked that among the options for dispersal tobe considered by Cabinet on 18 March should be the relocation of theDirectorate of Overseas Surveys (DOS).   As the Directorate is myresponsibility I am circulating a note on that subject.-2. As I said in my minute of 22 February there are three reasons whythe Overseas Development Administration&apos;s (ODA) Scientific Units shouldnot be dispersed:a. the cost would be considerableb. the highly trained teams could very well break up if dispersedto East Kildbridec. they have important links with institutions near to theirpresent sites.All these reasons apply to the Directorate of Overseas Surveys.    This is aUnit of high international repute which provides an invaluable service inmapping developing countries.    Such maps are indispensable in planningeconomic development: without them proper resource planning cannot beachieved.STAFF3. The DOS has been subject to a number of searching examinations inrecent years of which the most recent and fundamental was in 1977.Experienced staff have resigned as a result and morale is at an all time low.If a decision to disperse the Directorate is taken now, I would expect thosemembers of the staff with any prospect of other employment in the South toleave.    The output of the Directorate depends on its production staff; the bulkof these would have little difficulty in obtaining jobs elsewhere.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. Unlike the case of the ODA main grades already being dispersed,there will be no possibility of other Government officials in the London areavolunteering to take their place or of other staff being recruited in Scotlandbecause the Directorate trains its own staff and is the only source of theskills required.    Those remaining would not amount to a viable unit. Torecreate the Directorate would involve retraining a considerable numberof staff over a period of 3-4 years at a cost estimated in June 1979 to be 10, 000 a head.   If it were decided not to recreate it money would have tobe found for redundancy payments.    Thus we should have destroyed theDirectorate, incurred considerable costs and be no nearer finding 200 moreposts for East Kilbride.THE BUILDING5. The Directorate&apos;s machines require vibration-free areas and dust-free conditions.    The present building in Ea st Kilbride was not planned toprovide such facilities and would need considerable modification at additionalcost.    Since more space per head would be required because of the natureof the work carried out, many fewer than 650 could be fitted into the building.The whole dispersal programme would be seriously delayed and the ODAvanguard could not go up in early 1981 as planned.6. The Directorate has strong links with the Ordnance Survey atSouthampton and much of its work involves close negotiations withconsultancy firms in and around London.    These contacts would be muchmore difficult and costly from East Kilbride.7. The Directorate has been under threat of dispersal for years withdisastrous effects on morale.    We considered its dispersal again twicein 1979 and the decision was against doing so on both occasions. Nothinghas changed since then to make the case for dispersal of the Directorateany stronger than for any of the other units or departments in otherMinistries which were let off the hook last year.CForeign and Commonwealth Office12 March 19802CONFIDENTIAL
