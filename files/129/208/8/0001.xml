CONFIDENTIALINTRODUCTION1. It is the fundamental duty of Government to ensure thenation&apos;s security and keep it free to pursue, by just and peace-ful means, its legitimate interests and activities both at homeand abroad.   It is a duty which this Government takes veryseriously.   In this   statement we explain how - by what meansand on what principles - we propose to pursue it, and whatfinancial and other support we need to ask of the nation to thatend.2. For Britain, defence is far from the only means that providesfor security.   Our relations with other countries - political,economic and cultural, both bilaterally and in&apos;internationalorganisations - all play a key part.   So too can arms control anddisarmament.   Non-military means like these are much to be pre-ferred wherever they are available, effective and dependable. Butthe lessons of history and the plain facts of the world around usshow that nations cannot safely rely on these alone.   We must makeit clear to any potential adversaries that they cannot - save atthe gravest risk to themselves - resort to the use or threat ofarmed force to further their interests at the expense of our own.In short, we need effective deterrence.3. The fate of Afghanistan has reminded us forcibly of theselessons.   It shows our opponents have both the power to makenew territorial and strategic gains and the nerve to use thatpower.   If we are not to witness further such adventures in evenmore sensitive areas for the West, we must respond with firmnessand resolve and in solidarity with all the free nations of theworld.   The specific implications which this holds for aspects1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALof our defence policy are treated as they arise in the course ofthis statement.4. We must be ready to meet challenges to our security,on whatever scale they may appear, not only as we perceivethem today, but also in future circumstances which we cannotaccurately foretell.   Defence capability takes a long timeto build.   It cannot be acquired or re-built suddenly if,after it has been allowed to run down, the internationalscene darkens.   We must plan for the future and insureagainst adverse situations while at the same time workingfor better ones.5. These arguments would be hard for anyone to contest.What most people find difficult to accept is the sheer costof defence.   It is and always has been an expensive businessand we would all much rather spend the scarce resources ittakes upon more direct benefits like housing, education,health, improving our environment and personal expenditureBut the hard fact is that defence spending is not an alterna-tive to policies of this kind.   It is an essential pre-condition for them - or at least for our having any assuranc ? otenjoying their fruits.   Without the national security whichour defence capability provides, plans to contain inflation,restore incentives, secure economic growth, improve ourhealth care and our children&apos;s education rest on sand;for the national life in which these objectives can be pursuedin peace and freedom may disappear beyond recall.   To insureagainst that danger means effort, sacrifice and expense. Welive in a country which, for reasons of history and2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALgeography, cannot expect to opt out of the harsher realitiesof today&apos;s world.   We cannot expect to be granted peace andsecurity free of charge.6. Thus defence is not an end in itself, but a means to anend.   Our aim is to maintain deterrence.   To do so in the faceof the threat posed to us by the military build-up of theWarsaw Pact, we believe that this is a time for giving ahigher, not lower, priority to defence - for our allies aswell as ourselves.7. To say this is not to sign a blank cheque for defenceor to dismiss other spending programmes as unimportant. Thescale of our defence effort cannot be divorced from our generaleconomic capabilities, and we all know that Britain is goingthrough difficult economic times.   Within these constraints,this Government&apos;s task   is to get the balance of prioritiesright again, to restore our defence effort to the level neededto give the best possible guarantee of our country&apos;s safety,using the most economical means available, and in fullconsciousness of the complexity of the decisions and judgementswhich this aim imposes upon us.8. In this statement we set out the Government&apos;s generalpolicy on the defence of the United Kingdom and the West. Wereview the many areas in which decisions have been and will3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALbe needed, not only to determine the level of this year&apos;sdefence budget but to set the context of a coherent andstable defence effort in the years to come.   Areas whereparticularly important issues of this kind have faced ussince taking office include nuclear forces (covered inChapter 2) and Service pay (Chapter 6); the defence budgetitself is discussed in Chapter 8.   We describe the steps beingtaken in a whole range of fields - the deployment, trainingand equipment of our forces, the number and quality ofpersonnel - to sustain and improve our defence effort. Wediscuss the ways in which the needs of defence and theactivities of the men and women engaged in it interact withthe life of the community as a whole, and we illustrate thebenefitsyas well as the burdens .that this interrelationshipcan bring.   Where difficulties and dilemmas exist, we try toshow why we believe the solutions we are pursuing are the bestavailable in the circumstances.9.      To complement the information offered in this statement,we are publishing a second volume containing an extensivecollection of statistics on Britain&apos;s defence effort.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL1THE CONTEXT OF BRITAIN&apos;S DEFENCE POLICY101. Our defence policy is a response to, and must be shapedby, the potential threats to the security of the UnitedKingdom.   Such threats may take different forms of a more orless serious nature.   But the gravest potential threat isposed by the military forces of the Soviet Union and the otherWarsaw Pact states, which could be used directly in a militaryconfrontation with NATO or indirectly to challenge the West&apos;sbroader political and economic interests worldwide;   The sizeand reach of these forces makes them a potent political weapon.If not counter-balanced, they could be exploited to bringunwelcome influence to bear on the domestic and foreignpolicies of countries which, cannot match, the Soviet Union&apos;smilitary power.102. The United Kingdom could not face this challenge alone.Even if we could hope to do so in purely military terms, ourpolitical and economic survival is so closely bound up withthat of our allies in Europe and North America that ourcontinued security and freedom cannot be seen in isolationfrom theirs.   Our allies, facing the same threats, share muchthe same perception.   For the past thirty-one years;thereforewe and our allies have met the challenges facing us and have1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALprovided for the collective security of the West by joiningtogether in the North Atlantic Alliance.103. Our defence policy outside NATO is discussed in Chapter hof this statement.   This chapter discusses the main factorsthat shape British defence policy - the nature of the WarsawPact threat to NATO, and the character and strategy of theNorth Atlantic Alliance.THE WARSAW PACT104. For many years now the Soviet Union has devoted a largeproportion of its economic resources to increasing andimproving its armed forces.   The Soviet Union does not publishany realistic or comprehensive figures for military expenditure,and the published figure of some  17 billion roubles in 1979covers only about a quarter of actual Soviet expenditure.Western assessments indicate that military expenditure hasover the last 10 years accounted for about 11% to 13% of theSoviet Union&apos;s gross national product.   Military expenditurecontinued to rise by about 4% a year in real terms between1973 and 1977, when NATO spending was falling.   The Sovieteconomy is centrally controlled and the best technologicaland industrial resources are largely directed into themilitary field.   Defence is given priority over other claimson available resources, rather than having to compete as itdoes in Western economies.   With forces containing large2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnumbers of poorly paid conscripts, Soviet military plannersspend comparatively little on personnel and spend proportion-ately more than Western countries on equipment (see &quot;the table below).They spend proportionately less on operations and maintenance,partly because     their civilian wages are lower than jn the West, butalso because some Soviet military equipment is used lessintensively for training.Comparative Distribution of Military Expenditure(per cent) in 1977USSR UK USProduction of New Equipment 38 20 19Research and Development 21 11 10Military Personnel Costs 13 23 27Operations and Maintenance 25 44 41Construction of MilitaryFacilities 3 2 3Note    Data in this table have been adjusted to conform to theNATO definition of military expenditure and is therefore notcompatible with data in Chapter 7.105.   The extensive Soviet research and development programmeover the last decade has in many areas eroded the technologicallead which NATO used to enjoy.   Soviet facilities for militaryproduction are huge   and are being expanded still further, eventhough many plants are not&quot; working to full capacity. TheSoviet armaments industry supplies nearly all the equipment3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALused by the Warsaw Pact forces.   The Warsaw Pact thereforebenefits from economies in research, development and production,and the forces benefit from using standardised equipment.106.   The Soviet re-equipment programme has resulted in bothquantitative and qualitative improvements.   It has extendedover the whole range of weapon systems, from strategic nuclearmissiles to conventional weapons.   As we enter the 1980s, theSoviet Union has achieved a rough equivalence with the UnitedStates in strategic nuclear capability, and will have theadvantage over NATO in theatre nuclear weapons - particularlyin longer-range systems where they have been deploying themost modern weapons)such as the SS-20 missile and the Backfirebomber.   The Soviet navy has been strengthened by major newclasses of warship, such as the Kiev class aircraft carrier.On average over the past decade the Soviet Union has launcheda new nuclear-powered submarine every 6.weeks, whereas theWestern nations have on average launched one every 13-14 weeks;there is   also   an imbalance in aircraft production rates. Inthe key area of central Europe, the Warsaw Pact has always badmore forces than NATO, and their quality has been greatlyimproved with the introduction of many modern tanks, aircraftand other weapons; for example, aircraft introduced overthe last five years into the Warsaw Pact&apos;s tacticalair forces have twice the range and up to three timesthe payload of their predecessors.   Unlike NATO, the SovietUnion has a major capability for offensive chemical warfare.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSoviet forces maintain large stocks of chemical munitionsand are fully equipped and trained to operate in a chemicalenvironment.107. Why has the Soviet Union channelled so much of itsnational wealth into the military field, especially over thelast decade when both East and West have been pursuing detente?Several explanations are possible.   First, Soviet leadersregard military power as a key element in the pursuit of theirnational aims, and as the main symbol of their superpowerstatus.   Secondly, Russian thinking has historically favouredlarge military forces.   It can be argued that experience inWorld War II moves the Soviet Union to take out reinforcedinsurance on defence and that there is a traditional fear ofencirclement, heightened by relative isolation, past andpresent, from the rest of the world.108. There is also an explicitly aggressive motive for theSoviet military build-up.   It is a basic, if nowadays seldomstated, tenet of Marxist-Leninist philosophy that Communismwill ultimately be extended to every nation and that its spreadshould be promoted, if necessary, by military means when thecircumstances are right.   The Soviet Union has already demon-strated that it will use force to maintain the Soviet brand ofCommunism in Eastern Europe.   The invasion of Afghanistan atthe end of 1979 was the first example of military interventionto consolidate the Soviet hold on a country outside the Warsaw Pact.The Soviet Union will, we believe, continue to watch for opportunitiesto build up its influence in further countries and will be readyagain to use force.   The objective of this drive for Influenceis to limit and reduce first the influence and then the5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsecurity of the West.109. These are possible explanations or rationalisationsfor Soviet military growth.   But whatever motives we mightascribe to Soviet leaders or they themselves might offer byway of justification, the fact is that the Soviet militaryforces facing NATO are very much larger than would, in ourjudgement, be needed for defence alone.   This is all the moretrue in view of the fact that no NATO nation has any aggressiveintentions against the Soviet Union, as is reflected in theAlliance&apos;s military posture.   Moreover, Soviet militarydoctrine stresses the value of attack with concentrated useof massive force, of achieving strategic surprise by pre-emptive strike and of gaining decisive victories. Sovietforces are organised and trained accordingly.   Claims thatthese forces, despite their massive offensive potential, servepurely defensive purposes can do nothing to reassure theWestern nations.   NATO must therefore ensure that the SovietUnion could never expect safely to use these forces to defealNATO in a direct military encounter or to influence Westerndomestic or international policies.   To prevent the Sovietmilitary build-up from diminishing the freedom of action ofthe Western democracies, there is no alternative but to enhanceNATO&apos;s defensive forces to ensure that deterrence is maintained.110. Soviet strategists hold that any way in Europe islikely to escalate into a nuclear exchange, although they donow seem to accept that a campaign against NATO could startwith conventional warfare.   Certainly the Soviet leaders haveat their disposal the forces to conduct almost any form of6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcampaign that they may regard as necessary.   Moreover, theirability to prepare rapidly for war and to launch an attackat a time and place of their own choosing has improved andis still improving.   The amount of warning time NATO mightreceive before attack could be very limited.111. We have no reason to believe that the present Sovietleaders are deliberately planning to attack NATO.   Any suchadventurism would be foolhardy in the face of NATO&apos;s defences.But, should war ever break out, they intend to win andmeanwhile they can use Soviet military power to impress,influence or threaten less powerful nations to adopt policieswhich suit the Soviet Union.   Should NATO lower its guardor falter in its determination to defend itself, the opportuni-ties presented might be too tempting.   As long therefore asthe Soviet Union and its allies sustain and strengthen theirlarge military forces with a pronounced, offensive capability,we in the West must continue to ensure that our defences aresuch that the Warsaw Pact could never count on profiting fromthe use of military power.THE NORTH ATLANTIC ALLIANCE112. To face these growing military capabilities the UnitedKingdom and her allies join together in the North AtlanticTreaty Organisation.   The Treaty&apos;s key provision is that an7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALattack on one is an attack on all. NATO thereforeprovides each of its members with far greater security thanany could achieve alone.   The means by which it does thisare political as well as military.   The establishment of asafer and more co-operative relationship with Warsaw Pactcountries is an important objective of the Alliance. Butits primary task, and the one for which it was created, isto provide collective strength to deter aggression, and toresist it effectively if it comes.113-   In the thirty-one years since its formation NATO hassucceeded in deterring aggression.   It is in this country&apos;svital interests that it continues to do so.   This will dependon the willingness of member nations to make the effort andaccept the sacrifices necessary to sustain adequate defence.This Government is wholeheartedly committed to NATO anddetermined that the United Kingdom shall- pull its weight.114.   It will not be easy in the next few years for us orfor our allies to maintain and improve our contribution toNATO&apos;s defences.   We all face economic difficulties whichwill not be quickly overcome.   Nevertheless, all the allieshave endorsed the NATO aim adopted in 1977 of increases indefence budgets in the region of 3% a year in real terms.This increase in NATO&apos;s defence spending is necessary to makegood the gaps and correct the weaknesses which have appeared8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALin the Alliance defences while the Warsaw Pact countries havebeen building up their military strength over the last decade.115. In NATO, nations enjoy political and economic independence.From time to time this can bring a nation into political dis-agreement with an ally.   For example, differences persistbetween Greece and Turkey which have prevented the reintegra-tion of Greece into NATO*-s military structure after itswithdrawal in 1974.   It must be one of NATO&apos;s most pressingpolitical aims to see this situation resolved on a basis whichis acceptable to all concerned,to restore the Southern Flank tofull strength.   The Government will do all it can to help. Suchdisputes can affect NATO&apos;s cohesion, but so far  the Alliancehas proved politically strong enough both to withstand them andto help resolve them.   By contrast, the Warsaw Pact nationsgenerally serve the political and economic interests of theSoviet Union, giving them little room for independent manoeuvre.116. It is in the long run an immense source of strength toNATO that its members participate freely and that their peoplescherish the freedom and way of life NATO exists to preserve.The  Government believes that the people of this country and ofthe Alliance as a whole do    recognise the threat posed by thebuild-up of Soviet forces, and will support the political andmilitary measures needed to counter that threat.   But they will9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALdo so only if political leaders explain the dangers and whatis needed to ward them off.117. The United States&apos; commitment to the defence of Europeremains the vital foundation of NATO&apos;s political and militarystrength.   It reflects our American allies&apos; appreciation of theimportance of the continued security and liberty of WesternEurope to their own security.   The commitment is manifest in sixUnited States divisions stationed in the Federal Republic ofGermany; in the provision of United States naval forces in theEastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean; in United States AirForces stationed in the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, theNetherlands, Turkey, Greece and the United Kingdom; in the planafrequently exercised, for reinforcing all these forces rapidlyfrom the United States; and in the undertaking reaffirmed bysuccessive United States Presidents that they would have recourif necessary to nuclear weapons - both those held forward inEurope and their main strategic armoury - to protect and preserall their NATO allies.   The United States has strongly underlinits commitment by the vigorous political and military leader; hiit has shown in encouraging the Alliance to make good the weak-nesses in NATO&apos;s defences.118. The European allies have in response shown themselvesprepared to take the steps needed to strengthen their contribu-tion to NATO&apos;s common defence, individually and through increasco-operative effort.   The Eurogroup, an informal grouping ofEuropean NATO members within the   framework of the Alliance, hajplayed a valuable part in sustaining this work.   The Europeanallies also participate fully in the NATO infrastructure pro-gramme.   This has an Alliance-wide budget of  2,240 million fothe years 1980-84, which provides important collective facilit10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsuch as communications, hardened aircraft shelters andreinforcement support projects.119. The decade ahead will prove crucially testing years fortie Alliance, not least because of the challenge posed by theSoviet military build-up.   The general political health andcohesion of the Alliance is reassuring.   The United Statescommitment is firm.   Allied Governments have improved consulta-tion to concert their diplomatic activity effectively. Aboveall, there is basic agreement about the dangers we face andwhat needs to be done.ALLIANCE STRATEGY120. NATO adopts a strategy of forward defence and flexibleresponse which is essentially deterrent and defensive. Thestrategy is intended to deter aggression by NATO&apos;s possessionof forces which are able to mount a robust conventional defenceagainst attack and by making clear NATO&apos;s ability and will tohave recourse to nuclear weapons, should other means fail, tocause an aggressor to abandon his attack and withdraw. Theconcepts underlying the strategy are those of forward defenceand flexible response.121. Forward defence means that NATO must be able to mounta defence robust enough to deny an aggressor easy or rapidcapture of territory or other major assets.   To do this NATOmust deploy conventional forces well forward in considerablestrength, and must be able to bring up reinforcements in largenumbers and in good time.   Thus the United States, Canada, the11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALUnited Kingdom, the Netherlands and Belgium all stationforces permanently in the Federal Republic of Germany, asdoes France.122. Flexible response means that NATO should have at itsdisposal a range of options from which to choose in makingan appropriate military response to aggression.   In contrastto the former NATO strategy of massive nuclear retaliation,flexible response does not commit us to respond in any pre-ordained way.123. The aim of the Alliance is to make it very clearto any potential aggressor that he would run a high risk ofhaving inflicted upon his country a degree of damage which noobjective could justify.   To achieve this, the Alliance musihave at its disposal a range of conventional and nuclear militaijcapabilities which could be used in response to an attack. Thedefence options these provide should not only be militarily eit&lt;\ive   but    also express with unmistakable force and claritythe Alliance&apos;s determination to resist.   The step from onelevel of force to higher ones must not however be so severethat an enemy might suppose that the NATO countries would beunwilling to take it.   NATO therefore needs a full range ofoptions extending from a limited response with conventionalforces through to a full-scale strategic nuclear strike.124. This strategy has evolved over the last thirty years i*112CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALresponse to changing military and political considerationsand it has certain broad implications.   The strategy requiresNATO to have nuclear weapons as well as strong conventionalforces.   NATO could match the conventional forces of theWarsaw Pact only if the Alliance countries devoted a verylarge proportion of their economic resources to doing so, andwere prepared to distort their economic and social structuresaccordingly.   The Soviet Union is willing to impose thesepenalties on its people in a way that the members of NATOare not.   The NATO aim is to deter attack by possessingnuclear weapons; should deterrence fail and an attack occurwhich conventional forces alone could not contain, NATO couldthreaten to use - and, if necessary, actually use - nuclearweapons to cause the aggressor to abandon his attack. Toensure the deterrent is genuinely effective, NATO&apos;s nuclearplans must take full account of the Soviet Union&apos;s possessionof strategic and theatre nuclear weapons on a scale whichmatches, and in some categories considerably outstrips, NATO&apos;snuclear armoury.125.   Another consideration is that it is politically importantthat all allies should share the risks and burdens ofproviding for deterrence and defence.   All the allies wouldcommit their land and air forces to any battle on or overthe European continent, and some elements are permanentlystationed there.   Some allies which are not ruclear weaponstates also permit nuclear warheads to be stationed on their13CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALterritory in peacetime, and sometimes provide the deliverysystems, though the warheads remain under the control ofthe United States President.   These commitments parallelthe United States commitment to the security of Europe. Thissharing of risks and burdens is a source of great strengthto NATO.126.   The concept of forward defence flows from the considera-tion that there are in NATO no buffer states whose interestscan be valued lower than those of others.   There can be noquestion of sacrificing the territory of one ally in order toappease the aggressor or to make it easier for other alliesto defend themselves.127    NATO?s strategy depends upon NATO having the necessarystrength in each element of what is called the &quot;triad&quot; ofconventional, theatre nuclear and strategic nuclear forces,and we believe that the improvements now planned to thenuclear and conventional forces of the Alliance are urgentlyneeded.128.   The Alliance is engaged in a major programme - the Long-Term Defence Programme (LTDP) - to effect improvements in tenpriority areas in which collective action is needed to makethe most efficient use of Alliance resources.   The ten areascover improvements in readiness; reinforcement; reserve14CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmobilisation; maritime posture; air defence; command, controland communications; electronic warfare; rationalisation;consumer logistics; and theatre nuclear modernisation.129. The Government fully endorses the aims of the LTDP. Wealready have plans to meet many of the measures for which theUnited Kingdom has prime responsibility and we are playingour part in those steps calling for international co-operation.Together these measures cover a very wide spectrum of defenceactivity.   Our plans to fulfil our part of the LTDP arereflected in the remaining chapters of this statement.ARMS CONTROL130. The Government believes that arms control can play anintegral part in its efforts to ensure the nation&apos;s security.The members of the Atlantic Alliance have agreed since theSoviet invasion of Afghanistan that efforts to secure agreementon arms control should continue, though inevitably the prospectsfor success have been overshadowed.   Our aim is greaterstability - where possible at lower levels of forces. Balanced,practical and verifiable arms control measures can serve thisby limiting arms competition and making defence relationshipsmore predictable.   But experience shows that it is notrealistic to pursue arms control from a position of growinginferiority.   Our defence effort and our arms control policyare therefore complementary.15CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL131. I*1 December last year Alliance Ministers took a seriesof important decisions designed to improve the prospects forarms control in the early 1980s.   These included an offer tothe Soviet Union to negotiate on long-range theatre nuclearforces in the third round of the Strategic Arms LimitationTalks (SALT III), and a unilateral withdrawal of 1,000 UnitedStates nuclear warheads from Europe (see paragraph 217). Inaddition proposals were agreed to simplify the way for aPhase I agreement in Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions (MBFR)and on a package of verification and stabilization measures(Associated Measures) to accompany an MBFR agreement. Theseproposals were formally tabled by the West in Vienna on20 December. Finally, consideration is to be given to proposalsfor developing confidence-building measures within the frameworkof the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).The Alliance intends to work for the adoption during the MadridCSCE meeting of a mandate for further negotiations on militarilysignificant and verifiable measures.132. The SALT II Agreement is discussed in Chapter 2. Theprinciples which apply to SALT II must also apply to other armscontrol agreements; these must not codify existing imbalancesand they must be subject to adequate verification, sinceuncertainty can only lead to suspicion and instability.133. These principles are being upheld by the NATO Allies inthe MBFR negotiations in Vienna.   The Warsaw Pact has more16CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALtroops than NATO in the MBFR area; it follows that reductionsneed to be asymmetrical if they are not merely to perpetuatethe Warsaw Pact advantage.   Progress in the MBFR talks hasbeen slow, largely because of the disagreement over Easternforce levels.   But we hope that the initiatives tabled by theWest in December will provide a decisive impetus to enablethe early attainment of a Phase I agreement as a step towardsa full agreement providing for reductions to manpower parityin Central Europe.134.   The new proposals for a simplified Phase I MBFR agree-ment are designed to tackle those important areas which havebeen causing difficulty in the negotiations.   First, the needfor agreement on data is restricted to United States and Sovietforces; the discussion of data for forces to be reduced in aPhase II agreement can be deferred until after a Phase Iagreement.   This requires a .modification.of other aspects ofthe West&apos;s present proposals; in particular it would not bepossible at the time of a Phase I agreement to give anyspecific assurances on the scope and timing of Phase IIreductions.   Second, the new proposals have halved the scaleof United States and Soviet manpower reductions to be taken inPhase I compared with the levels previously proposed by theWest, bringing the levels broadly into line with those proposedby the Warsaw Pact.   Third, the West is proposing that discus-sion of equipment reductions be deferred.   At the same time,17CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALand as part of a Phase I agreement, the West has proposed apackage of measures designed to facilitate the verificationof an agreement through inspection and a regular exchange ofinformation, and to promote military stability and confidencethrough advance notification of military activities and ofmajor troop movements into the reductions area.   These measuresare also in part designed to help safeguard the security offlank countries.135.   We believe that the proliferation of nuclear weapons wouldincrease tensions ^putting at risk international security andstability.   The Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference inAugust will be an important event in the continuing search tocombine non-proliferation objectives with the widespreaddesire of nations to enjoy the benefits of nuclear power.Non-proliferation would also be served by a comprehensive banon testing nuclear weapons, on which we have been negotiatingwith the United States and the Soviet Union.   In internationalfora we have also supported a large number of proposals whichhold out hope of lowering tension among states.18CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2THE BRITISH CONTRIBUTION TO NATO&apos;s NUCLEAR FORCES201. Britain has possessed her own nuclear forces for overtwenty-five years to help deter aggression.   The Governmentis committed to maintaining their effectiveness.   All ofthem are assigned to NATO, but they can be used only on theexpress authority of the British Government at the highestlevel.202. Our nuclear forces exist alongside the very large onesof the United States, which has repeatedly stated itsdetermination to apply all its military capability if neededto ensure the defence of all its NATO Allies. Criticsaccordingly ask why Britain should maintain any nuclear forcesof its own.203. The Government has great confidence in the depth ofresolve underlying the United States commitment. SuccessiveUnited States Presidents could not have affirmed this moreclearly, nor backed it up more effectively by their forcedispositions in and for Europe.   But deterrence is a matterof perception, and particularly perception by a potentialadversary.   The decision to use United States nuclear weaponsin defence of Europe, with all the risk to the United Stateshomeland this would entail, would be immensely grave.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALParticularly now that there is inter-continental nuclearparity, a Soviet leadership - perhaps much changed incharacter from today&apos;s, looking at the world in terms ofvalues very different from those of the West and operatingin turbulent internal or external circumstances - mightbelieve that at some point in the development of conflictthe determination of the United States could waver. The pres-ence of enormous destructive power in independent Europeanhands is an important insurance against such a misperception.The nuclear strength of Britain or France may seem modest by com-&apos;paTiso&amp;-witnTthe super-power armouries, and so it is, but the damageit could inflict is in absolute terms immense. An adversaryassessing the consequences of possible aggression in Europewould have to regard a NATO defence containing these powerfuindependent elements as a harder one to predict, and a moredangerous one to assail, than one in which nuclear retaliato. ypower rested in United States hands alone. To reduce nowthe West&apos;s degree of long-term insurance against Soviet mis-calculations would   be a most hazardous step.204.   Britain&apos;s current contribution to the Alliance in thisfield is unique. France&apos;s distinctive policy - wellunderstood, long established and firmly held - debars herfrom undertaking the clear commitment to collective Alliancemilitary planning and strategy which we have made; and noother European member of NATO is even remotely a potentialcandidate to contribute independent nuclear forces. TheGovernment regards this distinctive British contribution toNATO as of very great importance and so do our allies.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSTRATEGIC NUCLEAR FORCES205. Both the United States and the Soviet Union have vaststrategic nuclear forces.   Their composition is shown inFigure &quot;2.    , which is based on the Statements of Data on theNumbers of Strategic Offensive Arms made in June last yearat the signing of the SALT II Agreement (Strategic ArmsLimitation Talks).   The Treaty itself specifies the types ofsystem to be counted as central strategic systems.   The SovietUnion will have to deactivate some 250 systems, probably theolder inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and aircraft,while the United States will not have to give up any operationalsystems.   The Treaty codifies the broad strategic parityalready achieved by the two super-powers.206. The signing of SALT II by President Carter and PresidentBrezhnev in Vienna was an important step in the long processof limiting strategic arms.- Following the movement of Soviettroops into Afghanistan at the end of 1979, however, PresidentCarter asked Senate leaders to delay the ratification debateon the Treaty while the Administration and Congress assessedthe situation and considered what response should be made.The British Government continues to hope that the Agreementwill be ratified in due course, but clearly we face a periodof considerable uncertainty.207. SALT II is a complex Agreement covering a. range ofissues which include numerical ceilings on strategic launchers,3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALprovisions for verification, counting rules, an agreed database and restrictions on the modernisation of existing systemsand the introduction of new ones.   These provisions would giveeach side a clearer understanding of the present and futurecapabilities of the other.   This would bring a valuable degreepredictability and hence stability to strategic planning.208. It was possible for the United States Administration and theUnion to reach agreement on SALT II because its provisionsare realistic, equitable and verifiable.   It would enable thesecurity of both parties to be maintained with fewer systemsthan would otherwise have been the case.   The numerous veri-fication provisions, and the acceptance that co-operation inverification is necessary, establish valuable principles forfurther negotiations.209. It was an important concern of the British Governmentthat SALT II should do nothing to undermine the effectivenessof Britain&apos;s independent nuclear forces.   Following theprecedent set by earlier SALT negotiations, SALT II does notcover the systems of countries other than the United Statesand Soviet Union.   Nor does it impair the ability of theUnited States to co-operate and collaborate with her alliesas in the past.210. Britain&apos;s strategic force currently consists of four nuclpowered submarines each carrying 16 Polaris A 3 missiles,4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALvhich are committed to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe. Attea, the submarines are almost invulnerable to pre-emptive attack,&quot;here is always at least one on patrol (with more explosive power!han all the munitions used in World War II) and further submarines(ould be quickly on station in times of tension.;11./&quot;~A programme of improvements to maintain the effectivenessof the strategic deterrent is well advanced.   The programme, code-named Chevaline, is designed to respond to Soviet anti-ballisticmissile capabilities which we know are being improved. Chevalineinvolves a major and complex development of the missile frontend and changes to the fire control systems.   The improvedmissile will carry advanced penetration aids and be able tomanoeuvre its payload in space.   The total cost of the programmeat prevailing prices is estimated at about  1 billion.   With itscompletion at hand, the Polaris force will remain effective intothe 1990s.   The Government is considering possible systems toreplace it thereafter, and a decision will be taken soon._7THEATRE NUCLEAR FORCES212.   As Chapter 1 explained, NATO recognises that to threatenall-out attack with strategic nuclear forces would not beappropriate or credible in response to aggression in any butthe most extreme circumstances.   To be able to respond flexiblyto aggression, the Alliance needs to partner its strategicnuclear forces by a full range of strong conventional forcesand theatre nuclear weapons.     (The coverage of the termtheatre nuclear forces varies with the context.   It is usedhere to cover all NATO and Warsaw Pact systems of types notregarded as central strategic systems in the SALT II sense.It thus includes a wide variety of systems ranging from the5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSoviet SS-20 ballistic missile with multiple independentlytargetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs) to artillery withnuclear shells.)213. The disparity between NATO and the Warsaw Pact inlonger-range theatre nuclear forces (LRTNF) is rightly amatter, of great concern to the Alliance.   The present position insuch systems is shown in Figure   3   . The contrast is stark. Thefigures for the Warsaw Pact include all land-based theatresystems not counted in SALT II which can reach targets inWestern Europe from their normal bases in the Soviet Union.The figures for NATO include all Western land-based theatresystems capable of reaching the Soviet Union from their normalbases in Europe. The figures exclude on both sides naval sys !Bmswhich may not have land attack as &quot;theirprimary role. The balancethat the Soviet Union is massively superior in LRTNF capability.214. If anything, the figures understate the relativestrength of Soviet LRTNF, since they exclude more &quot;potential*systems on the Soviet side.   Even so, they show a huge Sovietlead.   Moreover, the figures tell only part of the story.Although the numbers of Soviet delivery systems have not changedmuch over the last decade, it is the quality that has improved s(dramatically.   The SS-20 has greater range and accuracy thanthe older SS-4 and SS-5.   Unlike them, it has three independ-ently targetable warheads and is mobile.   Similarly, theBackfire bomber, coming into service at the rate of about 30a year, is much more powerful and effective than the olderBadger and Blinder.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL215. Since United States F-111s were deployed to Britainten years ago NATO has introduced no new land-based LRTNF.The British contribution in this category consists of 56Vulcan long-range bombers, which will have to be phased outof service in the early 1980s.   The airfields on whichaircraft such as they and the F-111s depend are vulnerableto SS-20s and Backfires, and their ability to penetrateSoviet territory     is      increasingly affected by the furthernodernisation of the Warsaw Pact&apos;s very extensive air defences.216. Against this background, the Alliance decided on12 December last year to embark upon a new LRTNF programmeenvisaging the deployment in a group of Western Europeancountries of 572 United States missiles, comprising 464ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs), and 108 Pershing IIballistic missiles.   Britain took an active part in shapingthis programme, warmly endorsed the Alliance decision andhas agreed to provide basing for 160 GLCMs.   The Governmentis now assessing with the United States where these shouldbe based.   Full account will be taken of environmentalconsiderations but the final decisions will have to begoverned mainly by military factors.   The choice made willbe announced as soon as possible, and this will be followedby full consultations with local authorities about theconstruction programme.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL217. The United Kingdom has also played an important rolein developing the proposals agreed by NATO Ministers inDecember last year for LRTNF arms control (see paragraph 131).We would regard an agreementinvolving significant reductions in the LRTNF deployments ofboth sides compared with the levels now projected as a highlysatisfactory outcome; but to proceed on the assumption that thisis --c rta n^-^tn: advance&quot; ~~ would actually reduce the chances ofachieving it.   The NATO proposals were linked with approval ofthe decision to withdraw unilaterally 1,000 nuclear warheadsfrom the United States stockpile in Europe.218. NATO and the Warsaw Pact also deploy other kinds oftheatre nuclear systems.   These include surface-to-surfacemissiles such as Scud, Scaleboard and Frog (with ranges upto 600 miles) on the Warsaw Pact side, and Lance and Pershing Ion the NATO side (with ranges up to 450 miles).   There arenuclear artillery shells for use in the immediate battle-fieldarea; nuclear surface to-air missiles to defend against airattack; atomic demolition munitions which could for examplebe used to close off mountain passes; nuclear warheadsdelivered by tactical aircraft; and nuclear depth bombs for8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALuse against submarines.119.   The Warsaw Pact has in total more theatre nuclear systemsthan NATO of these kinds, and is modernising them extensively,aough the numerical imbalance is less marked than in long-range systems.220*   Britain&apos;s contribution to the NATO systems includes bombswhich can be delivered by RAF strike aircraft and depth bombsby RN helicopters.   Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft can deliverUnited States nuclear depth bombs.   BAOR has British-ownedshort-range Lance missiles and artillery which can deliverUnited States nuclear warheads.221.   NATO theatre nuclear forces are no substitute foradequate conventional forces, nor do they indicate that NATOis prepared to engage in protracted &quot;war-fighting&quot; nuclearexchanges on Alliance soil.   Their role, .whether in deterrenceor in use, is to make plain that if an attack is pressedbeyond the capacity of NATO&apos;s conventional defence the Alliancehas the means and the will to resist further, if necessary withnuclear weapons, rather than back down and accept defeat. Theirdeterrent value works through ability to impose catastrophicmilitary effects, but their underlying purpose lies not inthose effects themselves but in seeking to convince anaggressor that he must halt his attack and withdraw, or riskdevastating consequences.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3THE BRITISH CONTRIBUTION TO NATO&apos;S CONVENTIONAL FORCES01. The Alliance does not and cannot rely on nuclear forceslone.   The objective must be to deter aggression, if possible,ithout any recourse to use of nuclear weapons.   This means thatATO must   &apos; .   be able to resist the formidable conventionalorces of the Warsaw Pact at their own level.   NATO&apos;s conventionalorces are out-numbered by the Warsaw Pact both in Europe and inhe Eastern Atlantic.   Of course, it is not possible to assessilitary advantage purely in terms of men, ships, tanks orircraft.   Other factors include the training and morale of men,he level of readiness, the quality of equipment, the deploymentsf forces, tactics and strategy.   The ability to achieveurprise is of course an advantage the aggressor always enjoys,evertheless, the current balance of readily available forcesn Central Europe (Figure /j-) and in the Eastern AtlanticFigureS) illustrates the preponderance*of Warsaw Pact strengthn these two areas which are crucially important to the Allianced to which Britain commits most of her forces.02. The full comparison is even graver, particularly in Centralurope.   The bulk of Warsaw Pact reinforcements would have toravel only about 450 miles from the Soviet Union to the Centraluropean front through Warsaw Pact territory; most of NATO&apos;seinforcements would have to come over 3f000 miles from Northerica, and to expect to be attacked by Warsaw Pactorces long before they reach the battlefield.     These hardCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfacts about the Central European balance point up thelimited relevance of  the much publicised Soviet decision towithdraw 20,000 men and 1,000 tanks from East Germany. Areduction of Soviet forces on this scale, although welcome,will have    hardly   any effect on the existing imbalance.303. Responsibility for ensuring that NATO&apos;s forces remainadequate to meet this threat falls to the three Major NATOCommanders (MNCs):- the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR);- the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT);- the Allied Commander-in-Chief Channel (CINCHAN).Figure 6 gives the command structure in moredetail, showing where Britain providesforces and commanders;        Figure 7 gives details of thepermanent or reinforcement forces we provide for various NATOcommands; and Figure 8 shows the NATO command areas.304. In peacetime most of NATO&apos;s forces remain under nationalcommand, but they are allocated to a MNC, and would be placedunder his direct command in time of tension or war. Someforces are under direct NATO command even in peacetime, suchas the Standing Naval Force Atlantic   and the- air defenceelements of the Royal Air Force, both in Germany and inBritain.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL305    Britain&apos;s military contribution to NATO is concentratedin four main areas:- nuclear forces;- the Central Region of Europe;- the Eastern Atlantic and Channel;- the defence of the United Kingdom home base.We also provide important specialist reinforcements. Britain&apos;snuclear forces have already been covered in Chapter 2.   In theremaining sections of this chapter   we present the essentialfacts on each of the other elements in our contribution, we dis-cuss what role;I6ur forces play, and we identify the major problemsthis poses and describe how we are tackling them.   We alsogive examples of the exercises and training which keep ourforces prepared for any action they may have to undertake.THE CENTRAL REGION OF EUROPE306.   NATO&apos;s longest border with the   Warsaw Pact runs throughthe Central Region of   Europe, and it is here that we face thegreatest concentration of Warsaw Pact forces.   The most directinvasion routes to the European heartland of the Alliance cutacross this region.   It is in this vital area for the defenceof NATO that British Forces Germany (BFG) are deployed,consisting of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) and RAFGermany (RAF(G)).   The presence of large British forces in theFederal Republic of Germany is a clear expression of the United3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALKingdom&apos;s commitment to forward defence.307. Another commitment we have in central Europe is thatdating from the end of World War II, to help maintain thesecurity of the Western sectors of Berlin.   This commitmentis met by the 3,000 men of the Berlin Field Force, togetherwith the American and French forces in Berlin   and supportedby the air link ^Jc^__ at RAF Gatow.   The Berlin FieldForce is not committed to NATO.British Army of the Rhine308. The main combat element of BAOR is the First BritishCorps (1(BR) Corps).   Together with German, Dutch and BelgianCorps, it is part of the Northern Army Group, which undera British   commander    is responsible for the defence of theNorth German Plain.   1(BR) Corps defends a vital sectorthrough which one of the main thrusts of any Warsaw Pactoffensive against NATO could be expected to come.   Such anattack would be spearheaded by large concentrations of tankswith armoured infantry, artillery, assault helicopter andaircraft support.   The task of 1(BR) Corps . is to disrupt,halt and then defeat these forces.309. The permanent peacetime elements of 1(BR) Corps arefour armoured divisions, an artillery division and units ofthe 5th Field Force.*fh*_ combat and4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsupport elements that make up an armoured division areillustrated in Figure 9  310. In an emergency, these forces would be reinforced fromBritain by -- the remainder of the 5th Field Force;- the 7th Field Force;- other home-based units, including some fromthe Territorial Army (TA);- Regular Army Reservists;- individuals from the Army&apos;s training andsupport organization.These would be moved by air and sea, using both civil andmilitary means.   After full mobilisation the strength ofBAOR would be more than doubled, and up to 70% of our Armywould be in central Europe and under NATO command. Thereserve and reinforcement forces are essential to the abilityof BAOR to fulfil its wartime role.   By exploiting reinforce-ment, we find a middle way between the prohibitive cost ofmaintaining BAOR permanently at war establishment and thegrave military disadvantage of complete reliance on a home-based Army all of which would have to be moved forward intime of emergency.RAF Germany311. RAF Germany is part of NATO&apos;s Second Allied TacticalCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALAir Force (2 ATAF) which, with its partner to the South,4 ATAF, makes up Allied Air Forces Central Europe.   2 ATAF,with its British commander, would be responsible for airdefence and ground support of the Northern Army Group overan area of 60,000 square miles of the Federal Republic ofGermany, Belgium and the Netherlands, and for operationsagainst targets beyond the battlefield.   RAF(G)&apos;s roleswould include attacking enemy ground forces, deliveringconventional or nuclear weapons against targets beyond theimmediate battlefield area, reconnaissance, fast helicopterlift of troops and stores and air defence.   In peacetime,RAF(G) is also responsible for policing part of the airspaceof the Federal Republic.312.   RAF(G) includes:- two squadrons of Buccaneer strike/attack aircraft;- four squadrons of Jaguars in the&quot;strike/attack role-- one squadron of Jaguars   in the reconnaissance role- two squadrons of Harriers, which would operate fromdispersed field sites in close support of the Army;- two squadrons of air defence Phantoms.The Royal Air Force also provides Wessex helicopters in supportof the Army.   The RAF(G) airfields are defended from airattack by Bloodhound and Rapier missiles.   RAF(G) would bereinforced in time   of tension by aircraft from operationaltraining units in the United Kingdom.   In addition, RAF6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsquadrons based in Britain are assigned to SACEUR&apos;s StrategicReserve (Air) (see paragraph 352) which could, if needed, bedeployed in the Central Region.The British Contribution in the Central Region313. The defence of the United Kingdom cannot be consideredseparately from that of the Alliance as a whole, and this isthe essential reason for deploying British forces to theCentral Region of NATO.   The forward defence of the Allianceon land begins at the Inner German border.   We thereforestation troops in the Central Region so that they can contri-bute effectively to NATO&apos;s forward defence in time of need.If these forces were stationed elsewhere, we could not besure that they would be able to reach their forward battlepositions in time.   If these forces were no longer committedto the Central Region and were diverted to other tasks, itcould not be assumed that other allies would be able tocommit forces to take their place.314. Apart from these strategic and practical considerations,there are important political considerations which underlieour present posture. The significance to NATO of the conceptof forward defence and the commitment to it of member countrieswas emphasised in Chapter 1.   The continued presence of BFG isimportant not only to the Alliance&apos;s military strength but also7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALto    its political resolve and cohesion.   It is therefore inNATO&apos;s interest and our own that British forces should remainin the Federal Republic of Germany in fulfilment of ourobligations under the Treaty of Brussels.   It must berecognised however that this is an expensive commitment andthat the foreign exchange costs of maintaining BFG havegreatly increased since it was first undertaken.   This problemis discussed further in Chapter 8.315.   There are problems to be overcome if BAOR and RAF(G)are to be fully effective.   The units of BAOR are understrength, which has necessitated the undermanning of someChieftain tanks and the reduction of one company to cadrestrength in many infantry battalions.   In addition, some 3,000men are deployed away from BAOR at any one time on short toursin Northern Ireland, though they can be returned very quickly.All this has imposed a degree of overstretch on some unitsand the RAF helicopters which support them, with adverseeffects on training and readiness.   The concept of having,below the divisional level, Task Force Headquarters actuated jonly in wartime (an idea introduced as a modification to therestructuring programme following the 1974 defence review)has proved unsatisfactory.   We need to improve BAOR&apos;s anti-armour and air defence capabilities and to speed up thearrangements for the reinforcement of BAOR in an emergency.
CONFIDENTIALor- the Royal Air Force we need to provide the aircraft, weapons andraining needed to make up for the Warsaw Pact&apos;s advantage in numbersand steady improvement in quality.   It will take time andscarce resources to solve all these problems.516.   The Government has made a start.   Chapter 6 records thesteps we are taking to overcome the manpower shortages createdby the heavy loss of skilled and experienced Servicemen inrecent years. Earl ~:thXa year we-made a reduetLiojai of&apos;one major unitNorthern Ireland, and this will bring some relief to BAOR.Task Force Headquarters are to be established permanently inpeacetime.     &apos;\&apos;Hf ry *IChapter 6 also describesthe : steps we have taken to improve the ability of theTerritorial Army and of Regular Army Reservists to reinforceBAOR in an emergency, and the equipment programme is describedin Chapter 7.Exercises and Training317.      The men of BFG need to be fully trained and preparedto carry out their war roles at all times.   All the trainingundertaken by the Services contributes to their readiness,and the extent of their worldwide exercise programme in 1979/80can be seen in Figure \0    , which shows both NATO and nationalexercises for all three Services.   But a good deal of thetraining must be specifically dedicated to preparing our land9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALand air forces for their role in a central European conflict,In particular it is important that Reservists and TA units shouldbe exercised regularly in their wartime roles.318. Exercise STEEL TRAP is a typical example of a majorjoint exercise held in 1979.   The United Kingdom Mobile Force,together with its air support (see paragraph 352 below),practised one of its wartime roles by moving to support1(BR) Corps.   In all 9,766 men (6,648 regulars and 3,118 TAvolunteers) were moved to the Federal Republic of Germany.STEEL TRAP was closely linked with the NATO Exercise COLD FIRE,which involved all the squadrons of RAF(G) and four squadronsfrom Britain.   Major exercises of this sort are needed to testour ability to move reinforcements, including Reserve forces,to Europe, to use home-based units in harness with 1(BR) Corpsto co-ordinate land and air warfare and to work with our allie319. Another key element of the training of 1(BR) Corps isthe battle group training at Suffield in Canada, which makespossible the live firing of all weapons.   Between May andOctober 1979; seven battle groups from BAOR trained at Suf field)for at least a month each.   Exercising these units in Canadarather than in Europe is costly, but neither the FederalRepublic of Germany nor the United Kingdom has adequate spaceand facilities for the live-firing training that the battlegroups need.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL320.   Because the Warsaw Pact&apos;s air forces out-number NATO&apos;sand because of   its   formidable air and ground based anti-aircraft defences, NATO must rely heavily on tactics andthe quality of its airmen to ensure that its air forces can;arry out their war roles.   In this respect   the Royal Air?orce is second to none, as is shown by the high marks thatRAF(G) consistently gains in NATO evaluations and competitions.521.   If our strike aircraft are to penetrate the Warsaw Pactdefences to destroy reserves, fuel and stores depots,communications and airfields, they must fly very fast and verylow.   This requires great skill, intensive training andconstant practice.   Facilities for low flying in West Germany -where airspace is even more crowded than in Britain - arelimited, so a good deal of the training for RAF(G) and otherRAF squadrons has to be done elsewhere.   For instance, lastyear RAF Vulcans, Buccaneers and Jaguars, took part in majorexercises in Canada and the United States that involved lowlevel attacks against simulated targets &quot;defended&quot; by aircraft,electronic warfare measures and anti-aircraft missiles. Forthe future we hope to be able to negotiate the wider use ofGoose Bay in Canada for Tornado low flying training at nightor in bad weather.      But much of the training must stilltake place in Britain.   We try to minimise the hazards anddisturbance. Aircraft must avoiddensely populated areas, airfields, nuclear power stations,hospitals and many other places; they must fly higher and11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALslower than they would in war.   We restrict low flying atweekends and after dark as far as possible.   Some inconven-ience and risk still remains; but it must be set against thegeneral balance of our forces&apos; relations with the community(see Chapter 5).   The plain fact is that this and other typesof Armed Forces training must be carried out if the Servicesare to be prepared to do the job expected of them in war.322.   Considerable publicity was given in 1979 to RAF aircraftaccidents, especially the tragic incident at Wisbech. Althoughthe Royal Air Force had slightly more accidents in 1979 thanin 1978 (26 as opposed to 24), the RAF accident rate in recentyears has been the lowest in its post-war history.   This improvment has moreover      been achieved at a time when a higherproportion of RAF flying involves fast jet aircraft, of ten atlow level.   Of the 26 RAF accidents in 1979   only three arelikely to prove on investigation to have been caused wholly ormainly by low flying as such.   To put matters in perspective,in the years 1969-1978 10 civilian deaths are attributableto RAF aircraft accidents; in the same period 26,769 pedestrianwere killed in road accidents.   A list of all Service flyinginvolving losa or serious damage to aircraftaccidents/in 1979 is at Annex D.   Data on accident rates, pubin Volume II of this statement, show   a generally decliningaircraft accident rate for all three Services. (Data for 1979 iVolume II may differ from those published previously as thecategorisation of damage sometimes changes after detailedinspection.)   In future the Ministry of Defence will publishinformation on the causes of all such accidents.12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALEASTERN ATLANTIC AND CHANNEL323*   Unlike the Warsaw Pact with its largely internal linesof communication for reinforcement and resupply, the NATOa lies are dependent on the free use of the sea.   In a timeof tension or war the transatlantic reinforcement of Europewould he crucial to Alliance strategy.   A major allied navaland air effort would be needed to protect this operation andthe continued shipment of essential supplies.   Unless NATOcan show itself capable of mounting and protecting thisreinforcement, the military credibility and deterrent effectof allied forces stationed outside continental Europe wouldbe compromised.   Without a NATO presence in these sea areas,Warsaw Pact naval and air forces would be able to operate inthe Eastern Atlantic and around our coasts unchallenged, bothin peace and war.   An effective Alliance presence in theseareas is therefore essential to maintain-the allies&apos; confidencein the plans for mutual defence, and to prevent any weakeningof the linkage between the European and the North Americanelements of the Alliance.324.   The recent growth in the size and capability of theSoviet navy has greatly increased the threat it can presentto the West.   In war, the reinforcements from North Americawould be most vulnerable to attack in the Eastern Atlanticand Channel areas, as they come within range of the operating13CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALbases of the Soviet Northern Fleet and its aircraft.   It isin these waters that the Royal Navy - the largest NATO navyin Western Europe - makes its major contribution to theAlliance&apos;s maritime effort.Composition of British Forces325. As Figure 6&apos; shows, a British officer - the Commander-in-Chief Fleet - holds the major NATO appointment of Commander-in-Chief Channel, and also that of Commander Eastern Atlanticunder SACLANT.   His headquarters at Northwood is co-locatedwith that of the Flag Officer Submarines (who is NATO&apos;ssubmarine commander in the Eastern Atlantic) and that of AirOfficer Commanding 18 (Maritime) Group RAF (who is the NATOcommander for allied maritime air forces in the Channel andEastern Atlantic).   From Northwood, continuous contact ismaintained with the ships and submarines of the Fleet, withRAF maritime aircraft and with our NATO allies.326. The Royal Navy&apos;s forces are largely structured for anti-submarine warfare (ASW).   At the same time, we also maintain significant anti-ship and anti-ac^r capabilities to deal with the tbposed by the powerful surface ships of the Soviet Fleet and by14CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALaircraft of its naval and long-range air forces.   In timeof tension most of our surface vessels and all our.submarines would be committed to the Alliance. Thiscontribution would include:- 4 Polaris submarines;- more than 25 nuclear-powered and conventionalsubmarines;- some 65 destroyers and frigates, almost allarmed with weapon-carrying helicopters;- 4 squadrons of Sea King ASW helicopters,operating from the larger warships and RoyalFleet Auxiliaries, equipped with dippingsonar.sonobuoys, lightweight torpedoesand depth charges;- some 30 Royal Fleet Auxiliaries providingessential afloat support.327.   With the arrival in service of the Sea Harrier thisyear (paragraph 71 # ) the Royal Navy will also have fixed-wingaircraft embarked at sea.   Shore-based air support, anessential factor in maritime operations, is provided by aircraftfrom No 1 Group, No 11 Group and No 18 Group of RAF Strike Command.It includes the following aircraft:- 4 squadrons of Nimrod patrol aircraft operatingprimarily against submarines;- 2 squadrons of Phantoms providing air cover (althoughmore resources could be available for assignment tothis task);CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL- 2 squadrons of Buccaneers for attackingenemy surface ships;- 1 squadron of Vulcans and Canberra aircraftfor maritime reconnaissance.The Role of British Forces328. Britain is uniquely placed among the European alliesto provide and support the forces needed by the Alliancein the important Eastern Atlantic and Channel areas. Intime of tension or war we would supply the mainweight of forces readily available in these areas. A vitaltask would be the deployment and protection of British andUnitejStates ballistic missile submarines. We would also have amajor part to play in neutralising enemy submarines; in support-ing NATO&apos;s Striking Fleet Atlantic; IhTthe- defence of reinforce-ment and resupply shipping and of amphibious operations;and in the seaward defence Of the United&apos;Kingdom itself.329. In peacetime, the Royal Navy provides a frigate or adestroyer for NATO&apos;s Standing Naval Force Atlantic and a minecountermeasures vessel for the Standing Naval Force ChannelWith vessels from other allied navies,        they contributeto a permanent NATO presence in those two areas.330. While the first call on the Royal Navy in war would bein the Eastern Atlantic and Channel, units could be deployedelsewhere in the NATO area.   Royal Navy vessels accordingly16CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALdaploy in peacetime to the Mediterranean and occasionallyto the Baltic.   A frigate is normally allocated to the NATOOn-Call Force in the Mediterranean when it is activated.The Royal Navy also has a worldwide role which is discussedin Chapter 4.   Figure  (/      gives an example of how theRoyal Navy&apos;s vessels can and do-deploy in and outsidethe NATO area, other than in home waters.331. Forward defence at sea entails having the ability toengage enemy forces wherever they may be deployed. Theco-ordinated efforts of surface ships, submarines and aircraftare needed, often in the form of Task Groups which provide awide range of capabilities for use according to the needs ofthe situation.   The exact composition and formation of a TaskGroup would depend on the kind of role for which it wasestablished - direct support of convoys and ASW operationsin support of NATO&apos;s Striking Fleet Atlantic are two examples.The elements from which a typical group might be made up areoutlined in Figure 13.332. The Royal Navy has substantial manpower problems. Inthe past few years it has lost some of its most able and17CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALexperienced men.   The steps being taken to counter thistrend are described in Chapter 6.   But in the meantime wehave been obliged by the shortages of personnel in key areasto =     place        one elderly helicopter cruiser (HMS Blake)and five of the older frigates in the Standby Squadron to ensuradequate manpower for new vessels coming into service. This shoease the immediate problems; the  ships     could be broughtforward quickly for use in an emergency, when they would bemanned by shore-based personnel.333.   NATO&apos;s Long-Term Defence Programme has called for moreand better maritime forces.   Because the limitations ofresources, including manpower, give little scope for increasingnumbers, the Royal Navy is placing priority on maintaining thequality of its ships, submarines and shipborne aircraft in theface of the improvement in the quality of the threat. Theintroduction of new ships, such as the Invincible class,operating Sea Kings and Sea Harriers, and new weapons, suchas the Sting Ray torpedo and the Sub-Harpoon missile, willsignificantly enhance the fire power of the Royal Navy. Theequipment programmes of the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Forceto meet their tasks in the Eastern Atlantic and Channel aredescribed in Chapter 7.18CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALExercises and Training334. Effective operation of maritime forces is complex anddemanding.   To help maintain the necessary high standards,NATO holds frequent exercises.   In 1979, for instance, amajor maritime exercise;OCEAN SAFARI 79.was held to test theforces&apos; readiness and to practise sea control operations andthe reinforcement of Europe.   More than17t000 n&lt;n  ,. 70 warshipsand 200 aircraft from eight NATO nations took part. TheBritish contribution included:- HMS Hermes and HMS Blake:- 11 destroyers and frigates;- 2 nuclear-powered submarines;- 2 conventional submarines;- 7 support ships;- aircraft from 12 RAF squadrons.As usual, the Warsaw Pact took great interest in the exerciseand observed it with warships, aircraft, intelligencegathering vessels and satellites.   The full extent of theRoyal Navy exercise programme can be seen in Figure IOjwith the programmes of the other two Services.THE HOME BASE335. The direct defence of the United Kingdom home base isobviously vital not only to this country but also to our allies.19CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn war it would provide a forward base foroperations in the Atlantic, a main base for operations inthe Channel and North Sea and a rear base for operations onthe Continent.   Our ports and airfields provide importantoperational bases and would be key assembly, transit andlaunching points for the reinforcement of NATO&apos;s forces onthe Continent,which would involve moving well over a millionmen and their equipment from North America.   As explainedabove, in the Eastern Atlantic and Channel areas the mainresponsibility for ensuring their protection would fall toBritish forces.   The sea routes used by our Polaris submarines,other warships and re supply shipping, together with portsand anchorages, would need to be kept free of enemy submarinesand mines.   At the same time installations vital to .&quot;Toperations on the Continent and in the Atlantic would haveto be protected from attack by    .&apos;-.        ^. sabotage groupsand aircraft.336. The main elements of the military home defence organisationshown in Figure The remainder of this sectionlooks in more detail at its tasks and problems under threeheadings: air defence, maritime defence and United Kingdomland forces.Air Defence337. Any Warsaw Pact conventional attack on Western Europewould probably include heavy air attacks with conventional20CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALweapons against the United Kingdom.with one of the aims beingprevent NATO bringing forward vital reserves and reinforce-ments.   Besides providing aircraft for NATO operations inEurope and in the Atlantic, RAF Strike Command would have todefend Britain from such air attack, being directly responsibleto SACEUR for the United Kingdom Air Defence Region.338. Warning of air attack would be provided by the UnitedKingdom air defence ground environment, which gathers informa-tion from a chain of powerful radars, from airborne earlywarning (AEW) Shackleton aircraft and from other NATO facilities.This information is fed to Sector Operations Centres.   With airrefuelling support from Victor tankers and with AEW interceptinformation from Shackletons, the Phantoms and Lightnings canintercept attacking aircraft several hundred miles from thecoast.   Bloodhound and Rapier surface-to-air missiles providea further line of air defence.   (See Figure \S ).339. The Royal Air Force must also monitor the airspacesurrounding Britain in peacetime.   Soviet military aircraftregularly penetrate the region (but not our territorialairspace) on intelligence gathering, training and transitflights.   These movements are watched and the aircraftintercepted by Phantoms or Lightnings held on quick-reactionalert.   We do not choose to intercept every such aircraft,but on average during 1979 four a week were intercepted andidentified.21CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL340. We regularly hold exercises to test our air defences.The largest in 1979 was exercise HIGHWOOD, in which theRoyal Navy and Royal Air Force jointly practised operationsin the United Kingdom Air Defence Region.   It involvedaircraft of 24 squadrons, 20 warships and 8 support vessels,and, as usual, was closely monitored by the Soviet Union.341. But this is another area in which there is room forimprovement.   Over the last two decades the effort devotedto the air defence of Britain has been sharply reduced. Thisderived from strategic concepts which reasoned that we couldnot realistically hope to defend ourselves against a strategicnuclear strike, that hostilities in Europe would escalate tonuclear warfare almost immediately and that the need to defendagainst conventional air attack could accordingly be largelydiscounted.   Now that the strategic situation has changedwe must do what we can to improve our air defences, especiallysince the Warsaw Pact has dramatically improved its capabilityfor conventional air attack.342. Plans are in hand for improvements. Our fighters arebeing fitted with more effective missiles. Airborne and groun&apos;radar systems for detecting hostile aircraft and directing ourown fighters are being modernised. We look forward to amajor strengthening of these defences with the introductionthe Tornado F2 interceptor in the mid-1980s.22CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL43.   The Government would like to do more, and has takencertain action already.   A few weeks after coming into offices decided to form an additional Lightning squadron, to armnumber of Hawk training aircraft with the AIM 9L air-to-airlissile and to improve the missile control system of thePhantom.   Further measures are being studied.   /&quot;Very recentlye were able to announce a programme to extend the capability)f the Sky Flash air-to-air missile in order to take fulldvantage of the powerful radar of the Tornado F2._7   It muste recognised that modern fighters are costly to buy andperate, and they need highly skilled manpower; other claimsn defence funds and manpower limit what is possible. Never-heless we attach a high priority to the air defences of thenited Kingdom and shall continue to seek improvements.aritime Defence44.   The Commander-in-Chief Naval Home- Command is responsibleor the seaward defence of the home base, which includes theElyde submarine base and other naval bases and ports whichould be used for the reinforcement and re-supply of Europe,he Naval Home Command is also responsible for the organisa-ion of the Port Headquarters and the Naval Control of Shippingirganisation which would direct the movement of merchantihipping.   Mine warfare and anti-submarine operations in the Unitedingdom te waters are the responsibility of the Commander-in-hief Fleet.23CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL345. Over the next few years the Royal Navy&apos;s mine warfarecapability will be modernised and strengthened with theintroduction of the new Hunt class vessels, which have thedual role of mine-hunting and mine-sweeping.   We intend toorder a new class of mine-sweeping trawlers and we are lookingat the possibilities of using hovercraft in the mine counter-measures support role.   We are also planning to modernise ourmines and to develop new types for defensive and protectivemining.346. The Royal Marines assist in giarding key naval installa-tions and in maintaining a quick reaction force for the defenceof offshore installations (see Chapter 5).   In particular, theformation of a Royal Marines Security Company (see paragraph515) will significantly enhance the capability of the RoyalMarines for these tasks.347. The Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) would play an importantpart in maritime defence.   It currently mans six mine counipv&apos;;measures vessels, and will in due course man the new mine-sweeptrawlers.   RNR personnel train to man the Maritime Headquartersand the Naval Control of Shipping organisation in tension or waand to provide other support for the Royal Navy.   Royal AuxiliaAir Forces personnel are also involved in manning the MaritimeHeadquarters.   An RNR(Air) branch will be formed this year andwill have the twofold role of augmenting front-line squadronsand increasing the pool of expertise for the Fleet Air Arm inwar.   The Royal Naval Auxiliary Service would help to man thePort Headquarters and also provides valuable local support toRoyal Navy units.24CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALUnited Kingdom Land Forces3 8.   The Headquarters of the United Kingdom Land Forcesc mmands the nine Army districts shown in Figure    /4- ;HQ Northern Ireland is under the direct command of theMinistry of Defence.   The Army Districts command varyingnumbers of Regular Army and TA units and those Field Forcesbased in the United Kingdom in peace*.   In time of tension orwar, many of these units would be deployed to the Continent.Almost all the remaining forces would carry out home defencetasks in the United Kingdom.   These would include protectingdefence and other installations against sabotage or attack.&apos;.        . ^fiit-&quot;V The whole ofTfche 8th Field Force,with both Regular and TA units,1- is maintained for home defence.349. Home defence would place heavy demands on the Army,particularly before the completion of mobilisation providesthe TA and other Reservists earmarked for home defence. Weare considering what increase from the pool of uncommittedReserve manpower we would need to supplement the forcesassigned to this task and what improvements in equipment theTA needs to fulfil this role.SPECIALIST REINFORCEMENT FORCES350. In addition to the contributions to NATO&apos;s forces alreadymentioned, the United Kingdom provides SACEUR and SACLANT with25CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhighly trained and well equipped forces as part of NATO&apos;sspecialist reinforcements.   These forces can be deployed tovarious parts of Alliance territory,  i v ^351. Politically,. NATO&apos;s mobile forces reinforceNATO&apos;s cohesion by demonstrating the willingness of other NATOnations to come to the aid of a member.   Militarily, theystrengthen NATO&apos;s ability to respond flexibly to aggression,especially on the flanks of NATO, and so make a valuablecontribution to deterrence.   Given their^pollticaland military trat?ortgice;   7_we~ believeit right that Britain should continue to contribute to them.Although some of its individual components are not large, theBritish contribution provides a diversity and flexibility ofcapability and allocation which no other. European NATO memberis in a position to match.352. Forces for SACEURa.   Allied Command Europe Mobile Force (AMF). TheAMF is a multinational force of land and airelements, ready to move at very short notice to athreatened flank region.     The British Armycontributes some 1,800 men, consisting of aninfantry battalion group, a logistic supportbattalion and other combat and support troops.26CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Royal Air Force contributes a squadron ofHarriers to the air element and Puma helicoptersto support the land force.b. United Kingdom Mobile Force (UKMF). Theland element of UKMF consists of the 6th FieldForce and its logistic support group. Itconsists of about 13 500 Regular and TA soldiersand includes one parachute battalion.   The airelement consists of a squadron of Puma helicoptersand a squadron of Jaguars.c. SACEUR&apos;s Strategic Reserve Air (SSR(A)). TheSSR(A) is made up of British and United Statessquadrons which can be deployed to any region ofACE.   We contribute three Jaguar squadrons andone Harrier squadron.   One of the Jaguar squadronsand the Harrier squadron also have alternativeuses with the UKMF and AMF respectively.d. Individual Unit Reinforcements. Britainprovides other specialist reinforcements to variousregions of ACE.   These consist of:- Special Air Service units;- One squadron of Buccaneers and one ofCanberra reconnaissance aircraft for deploymentto the Northern Region;27CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL- One squadron of Canberras for deployment to theSouthern Region;- One squadron of Vulcan Maritime reconnais-sance aircraft tasked to theNorthern Region.353. Forces for SACLANT.   The combined United Kingdom/Netherlands amphibious force is assigned to SACLANT. Itsdeployment options include the reinforcement of Norway,Denmark and the Atlantic Islands.   It consists of:- a brigade headquarters;- four Royal Marines Commandos;- an amphibious combat group of the RoyalNetherlands Marine Corps;- amphibious shipping;- combat, helicopter and logistic support.The landing element numbers about 7,000.   A large proportionof the force (a brigade group of three units with full support)is specially trained to operate on skis throughout the Arcticwinter.   Oversnow vehicles for this role are stockpiled inNorth Norway.   This collaborative force is another liotable demostration of Alliance co-operation and commitment to forwarddefence.354. The British elements of all these forces are normallystationed in the United Kingdom in peacetime, but they28CONFIDENTIAL

NATO&apos;sability to deploy quick reaction forces to the Northern Flankwill be tested in March this year on  xercise ANORAK EXPRESS 80aril in August on Exercise TEAMWORK 80.   In ANORAK EXPRESS theAt 1 with its British element will deploy, and the UnitedKingdom/Netherlands Amphibious Force will also take part asthe culmination of their annual three months of arctic trainingin Norway.   In TEAMWORK 80 the United Kingdom/Netherlands Amphibious Force will be augmented for the firsttime by a substantial proportion of the Royal Marines Reserves.29CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4WIDER DEFENCE INTERESTS401. The United Kingdom&apos;s defence resources must be concen-trated on our key NATO tasks, but our defence policy shouldalso be designed to help protect, wherever possible, our ownand more general Western interests over a wider area, includingthose outside the NATO area.402. The United Kingdom still has national defence commit-ments further afield, including the defence of dependentterritories.   Paragraphs 412-422. below show how we meet thesecommitments.   The Government will continue to devote theresources needed to meet those commitments as long as theyremain.   In common with our NATO allies, we also have widerinterests outside the NATO area which we cannot afford toneglect.   We depend on the developing world for many rawmaterials.   The security of our trade routes is therefore ofvital importance to our economy and we have a substantialpractical interest in the stability of the countries withwhom we trade.403. Increasing interdependence between the nations of the /orld will not of itself produce stability in internationalrelations.   The incidence of both internal and external armedconflicts has not diminished in recent years.   Whatever theirbrigins, these conflicts present the Soviet Union and itslilies with opportunities to advance their own and to reduce1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALWestern Influence in important areas such as the Middle East,Southern Africa, the Caribbean and the Far East.404. The Soviet Union has an increasing capability, aided byits Warsaw Pact and Cuban allies, to intervene in the ThirdWorld.   Soviet ability and willingness to exploit regionalinstability could have serious consequences for the West ifallowed to grow unchecked.   The Soviet Union&apos;s actions aregoverned in part by its assessment of the West&apos;s reaction andwe can expect the Soviet leadership to recognise and exploitany indecision, mistakes and weaknesses.   The Government willcontinue to play a full part in firm collective Westernresponses to Soviet encroachments.405. A major indicator of the growing Soviet interest in theglobal projection of their power has been the development of theSoviet navy.   Figure    /&lt;&gt;    compares the number of Soviet navalport visits in 1968 with the number in 1978 - more than athreefold increase.   This powerful fleet-is becoming increasing]effective in supporting Soviet political initiatives in peaceand is growing in military effectiveness for war.   The Sovietair force has also increased its       transport power, and thusits capability to move forces very quickly to points of tension]In recent months, the use of Soviet air and land forces in theinvasion of Afghanistan has been a particularly dramaticillustration of the Soviet Union&apos;s willingness and ability tointervene without the least justification in the affairs of asovereign country in pursuit of its own interests.406. How should the West respond to the global threat to itsinterests?   The best answer is to try to remove the sources of2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALregional instability which create opportunities for outsideintervention.   In some circumstances, military measures willnat be appropriate at all; in others, they may form only onecomponent of the total response.   Diplomacy, development aidand trade policies will usually have a greater contributionta make.   The Soviet Union and its allies do not match theWast in providing economic aid to the Third World, and Soviet,Warsaw Pact and Cuban military assistance has often provedunpopular with its recipients.407.   Nonetheless many forms of defence assistance can andshould play a part in the support of friendly nations. TheGovernment believes that the United Kingdom should make fulluse of these possibilities where resources allow.   Thus we shallcontinue to train &quot;members of Commonwealth or foreign armed-forcesboth in the United Kingdom and by sending personnel on loanto foreign Governments.   In 1978/79 over 6,000 fromnon-NATO countries were trained in Ministry of Defenceestablishments, and there were almost 600 British personnelserving on loan outside the NATO area.   Advisory visits andsales of defence equipment can also make a useful contributionto our support of nations who might otherwise turn away fromthe West for assistance.   We shall continue to foster closedefence relations with those non-NATO countries, members ofthe Commonwealth and others, who seek our assistance and valuethe expertise of our Services.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL408. Over and above this, the West must make it clear tothe Soviet Union and its allies that it is capable ofprotecting essential interests by military means should theneed arise.   That task cannot and should not be left to theUnited States alone.   Of our European partners, France hasmajor defence commitments in Africa and elsewhere, and retainspermanent forces in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Vesselsof the Federal German, Italian and Dutch navies undertakeoccasional deployments beyond the NATO area.   Belgium providestraining assistance to Zaire.   All such activities help toprotect Western interests worldwide.409. Against this background, the Government believes thathe Services      should also be able to *operate effectively outside the NATO area, without diminishingour central commitment to the Alliance.   British forces willtherefore continue to deploy and exercise outside the NATOarea from time to time.   Moreover, certain improvements inthe Services&apos; worldwide capability are being considered.of extra transport aircraft;These include the provision/of additional afloat support;a logistic stockpile; and improvements to the manpower andequipment of the Headquarters of 8th Field Force, the HomeDefence formation, which would also be capable if necessaryof undertaking worldwide tasks.      From April this year oneparachute battalion will always be available to provide aparachute capability at seven days notice.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL41Q.   Such improvements can be achieved at relatively modestc st^yet they give the Services significantly more flexibilityteiundertake tasks outside the NATO area.   What is needed isthe ability for all-three Services to combine in providing af rce of appropriate size and capability as may be necessary.411. We hope that NATO as a whole will increasingly recognisethe global nature of the Soviet challenge; and that Alliancemembers who are, like the United Kingdom, able and willingwhere necessary to counter that challenge will consult beforedoing so and, where appropriate, act together.   We shall givethe strongest encouragement to such recognition and consultationwithin the Alliance.DEPLOYMENTSCyprus412. British forces are deployed in Cyprus both in theSovereign Base Areas and as part of the British contributionto the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).413. The Sovereign Base Areas.   When the independent Republicof Cyprus was established in 1960two small areas on the south coast ofthe island     remained     under the sovereignty of the Uni-tedKingdom.   These two bases - one at Akrotiri, which has amajor airfield, and one at Dhekelia - allow us to keep a5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmilitary presence in the Eastern Mediterranean; to maintainimportant radar and communications facilities; and to assistUnited Nations (UN) peacekeeping operations by providinglogistic support to all the contingents of UNFICYP and somelogistic help to the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Armyof up to battalion strength from the United Kingdom andBAOR use the excellent facilities in Cyprus for training. TheRoyal Air Force operates and defends the Akrotiri airfield,and operates Whirlwind helicopters for general support andfor search and rescue.   RAF Akrotiri serves as a base forarmament practice by fighter aircraft from the United. Kingd mand RAF Germany; there were ten such deployments to Cyprusduring 1979.   The strategic importance of Cyprus.and the useful-ness of the airfield have been vividly demonstrated during thepast year when Akrotiri was&quot; used as a base for evacuatingpeople from Iran   and        as a staging point for moving themonitoring force to Southern Rhodesia.414. UNFICYP.   UNFICYP, of which the British contingent isthe largest component, is deployed to keep the peace on theline between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot zones.The extra costs of deploying the British force with UNFICYPrather than in the United Kingdom are met by the Foreign andCommonwealth Office, which shares with the UN the costs ofproviding logistic support for the other UNFICYP contingents.415. Our contribution to UNFICYP and the help we have given toUNIFIL demonstrate the Government&apos;s commitment to the peace-keeping role of the United Nations.   We shall continue to give6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfull support to current and future UN peacekeeping operations,subject to national commitments and exigencies.Gibraltar416. There has been a British military- presence in Gibraltarsince the eighteenth century.   Our forces are stationed thereboth for its security and because of its strategic positionat the Western entry to the Mediterranean, which makes it animportant asset and base for NATO as a whole.417. A Royal Navy destroyer or frigate is always held oncall to assist in the defence of Gibraltar.   Some 650 RoyalNavy personnel man the naval base and help run the dockyard.The Army provides a garrison of some 790 officers and men.ofwhich the resident infantry battalion represents the majorpart.   The airfield, used by both civil and military aircraft,is operated by the Royal Air Force.   There are no residentoperational aircraft, but there are regular deployments forexercises and training, and in wartime the airfield couldaccommodate NATO aircraft. - The Royal Air Force also providesa search and rescue service.   Some 1,900 civilians areemployed in support of the Services in Gibraltar; 1,350 ofthem are employed in the dockyard.Belize4lg.   British forces are stationed in the dependent territoryof Belize to deter any aggression by Guatemala in pursuitof its claim to Belizean territory.which arises from adiffering interpretation of an 1859 treaty under which7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALGuatemala recognised the existing border.The Belize garrison includes infantry units,Harrier, Puma and Gazelle aircraft and an RAF Regiment Rapierdetachment to defend the airfield.   There are also armouredreconnaissance, artillery, air defence, engineer and communi-cations units.   A Royal Navy warship, supported by a RoyalFleet Auxiliary, is deployed to the Caribbean andWestern Atlantic as the Belize guardship.   It can take upstation in Belizean waters at short notice.The Falkland Islands41^.   The Falkland Islands, which are a dependent territory,are claimed by Argentina.   A solution to this dispute accept-able to the    people      of the Islands has yet to be found,A detachment of Royal Marines is permanently stationed there.The ice patrol ship   HMS Endurance   supports the garrison andother Royal Navy vessels visit the Islands from time to time.Hong KongkZo.   Units of all three Services are stationed in Hong Kong.The garrison demonstrates Britain&apos;s commitment to preservethe colony&apos;s territorial integrity and security.   The residentforces consist of:- four infantry battalions (three of themGurkha units);- a Gurkha engineer field squadron;8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL- a squadron of Army Scout helicopters;- five RN patrol craft;- a squadron of RAF Wassex helicopters.421.  Following a large increase in illegal immigration fromChina, the resident forces were temporarily reinforced inmid-1979 to assist the civil authorities. The reinforcementsconsisted of:- one infantry battalion from the UnitedKingdom (subsequently relieved by a RoyalMarines Commando);- two Gurkha companies;- three Army Scout helicopters &apos;- two RN Sea Kings.Two hovercraft, a fast patrol boat, raiding craft anda Royal Marines small boat team arrived later.   The reinforce-ment operation demonstrated our willingness and ability toreinforce Hong Kong in an emergency.   It was also a notabledemonstration of the Services&apos; flexibility and ability toundertake a rapid reinforcement. The infantryand Sea Kings were later withdrawn following a large drop inillegal immigration, but it was decided to send&apos;an infantrybattalion from Britain and Gurkha companies from Brunei toHong Kong early this year following another increase in illegalimmigration.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALBrunei42Z.   A Gurkha battalion paid for by the Government of Bruneiwill continue to be stationed there until 1983.   The UnitedKingdom will then relinquish its responsibility for Brunei&apos;sexternal affairs and its consultative commitment to Brunei&apos;sdefence.   Brunei also provides facilities for several company-size exercises a year for the Hong Kong garrison,and home-based units take part in jungle training courses there.EXERCISES AND TRAINING423.   Exercises outside the European NATO theatre add to &quot;the fiexibof the Service&apos;s annual training cycle.   They help to maintainlinks with Commonwealth and other nations, to demonstrate theUnited Kingdom&apos;s continued interest and support and to offsetthe shortage of suitable training areas in Europe. Armytraining in Canada (paragraph 319) and air defence trainingin Cyprus (paragraph 413) are examples.   &quot;Out of theatre&quot;training also offers specialist facilities such as mountain-eering, parachuting, diving and jungle training, in particularclimatic conditions and terrain.   The map at Figure loshows the extent of the Services training programme outsidethe NATO area.42ij*.   Roughly once a year, a Royal Navy task group undertakes a m. 10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALdeployment outside NATO waters, visiting ports and exercisingwith the naval forces of friendly nations.   In May 1979 agroup consisting of a destroyer, five frigates and three RoyalFleet Auxiliaries sailed for a seven month deployment to theFaEast.   A nuclear submarine joined in the initialMediterranean phase of the deployment, during which the. grouptook part in the NATO exercise DAWN PATROL.   The group spentsome three months in Australian waters, exercising with theAustralian and New Zealand Navies.   Figure    if    traces thepassage of this deployment, showing the ports visited and themain exercises undertaken.   During 1980 another group willundertake a seven month deployment through the Suez Canal toNorth East Asia,^~, --including: - a. visit to China_7.11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALRHODESIA425. ^Following the successful conclusion of the Lancaster HouseConference last December, a liaison, advisory and monitoringorganisation of British and other Commonwealth Service officersand men was rapidly deployed to Southern Rhodesia. The&quot;monitoring force&quot; has had a major part to play in the arrange-ments which the British Government has made for Rhodesia&apos;stransition to independence.   The circumstances are unique.426. The organisation is headed by a British Major-General,who acts as Military Adviser to the Governor, chairs theCeasefire Commission and commands the monitoring force.   He hasat his disposal some 1,400 officers and men, speciallyselected from the armed forces of Britain, Australia, NewZealand, Kenya and Fiji.   The United States Air Force helpedthe Royal Air Force to airlift the force to Rhodesia.427. The role of the military monitors has been to observe andreport on the operation of the ceasefire, in accordance with theagreement reached at Lancaster House.   To help them in theirtask, the monitors are equipped with Puma, Gazelle and Scouthelicopters, a large number of vehicles and an independent,secure radio network.   A number of RAF Hercules aircraft havealso been deployed to Rhodesia.   The monitors have no&quot;intervention&quot; capability or role, and they are therefore armedonly for self-protection. Wt428. The tasks that the monitors face are daunting ones.Operating in small groups, widely dispersed and in difficultconditions, they have displayed ingenuity and courage of a hi$12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALdegree.   Their success provides a further example of the flexi-bility and resource of the British Services and of their Common-w  Ith partners.   Once Rhodesia becomes independent, the task ofths monitoring organisation will be over and it will return home429. The Services have a long tradition of providingvaluable assistance overseas by helping in humanitarian aid,disaster relief and rescue operations.   Royal Navy vesselsand helicopters, Army units and Royal Air Force transportaircraft all participate in these activities.   In the pastyear, for example, the Services have provided emergencyhumanitarian aid in Jamaica, Nicaragua, Sudan, Kampuchea,Dominica and elsewhere; some of these operations are describedin more detail below.430. Nicaragua.   At the request of the .InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross, a Royal Air Force Hercules lastyear helped to transport relief supplies to Nicaragua. Between15-30 July it flew 19 sorties to Managua, carrying over 220tons of freight.   On 18 July at Managua, the crew preventedan attempt by an armed crowd to hijack the aircraft.431. Dominica.   In August 1979, HMS Fife was diverted toDominica, with RFA Cherryleaf in support, to helprestore    normality to the island after the devastation causedby Hurricane David.   HMS Fife arrived immediately after theRELIEF OPERATIONS13CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhurricane had passed and for several days was the sole meansof communicating with the outside world.     The crew immediatelyset about clearing roads, restoring the water supply andrepairing the hospital, while the ship&apos;s helicopter flewmedical and other stores to outlying areas. Subsequently,the Royal Air Force flew supplies to Barbados for onwardtransmission to Dominica to help the relief work, and a unitof Royal Engineers helped by rebuilding roads, schools andother services.432. Kampuchea.   Again at the request of the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross, the Royal Air Force deployed aHercules to Bangkok for five weeks to airlift essential reliefsupplies into Kampuchea.   It began operations in Octoberand flew 34 sorties to Fhnom Penh, carrying some 500 tons offreight.   This consisted mainly of heavy lorries and Landroversas well as food and medical supplies.433. Iran.   During the unrest in Iran in early 1979, theRoyal Air Force and Royal Navy evacuated some 1,200 people,mostly British nationals.   As soon as it became clear thatevacuation might be necessary, Hercules aircraft were deployedto Bahrein and from there evacuated people from three differentIranian centres.   At the height of the operation, one VC10 andthree Hercules were also deployed to Akrotiri in Cyprus andevacuated 650 people from Tehran.   Smaller numbers were evacuatby survey vessels operating in the Gulf.14CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL434.   Other Aid.   There were also numerous less dramaticinttances of Service aid in 1979.   For instance, HMS Gurkhawas diverted to offer help to St Vincent after the Island&apos;svolcano erupted; Royal Engineers built bridges in Kenya,supervised the construction of roads and buildings inSt Vincent, the Falkland Islands and Gambia, improved thewater supply on St Helena and helped improve the electricitysupply on Tuvalu.15CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5THE SERVICES AND THE COMMUNITY31.   The services which the Armed Forces render to theoamunity at large are not limited to deterrence in peacetimead defence in war.   Many of the facilities and functionsSuch are maintained for defence purposes can also give vitalelp to the civil community and can be used to deal withpacific emergencies.   The most familiar example of the con-ribution the Services   make in this area is their engagementn the struggle against terrorism in Northern Ireland. Thisask is discussed below.   Beyond this, however, the Armedorces offer the community a more extensive range of servicesd support than is generally recognised. . -NORTHERN IRELAND502.   The work of the Services in Northern Ireland, soinportant to the Government&apos;s aim of defeating terrorism andlestorlng normal policing, is dangerous, hard and often tedious, ich of their work in support of the Royal Ulster ConstabularyCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL(RUC) is necessarily spent on routine patrolling, as often incity streets as in open countryside, on checkpoints and onstatic guard and observation duties.   Great responsibilitydevolves upon junior NCOs and on individual soldiers. Theseduties, particularly searches of people and their vehicles,demand high levels of concentration, tact and sensitivitytowards the community.   All this has to be conducted underconstant threat of terrorist violence.503.   The Provisional IRA still constitutes the main threat tosecurity, and its policy of ruthless murder was aimed primarilyat members of the Security Forces during 1979.   In the latterpart of the year more sectarian attacks, including some from&quot;loyalist&quot; extremists, have been evident.   Forty-eight Servicepersonnel were killed in 1979ymore than in any year since 1973.Ten       members of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) wereamongst those who died.   The tragic events at Warrenpoint on27 August, when 18 soldiers died in remote control bombattacks, alone caused more Army deaths than those in each ofthe last four years.   On the other hand, civilian casualties atS\ are broadly in line with those of the last two years.Thanks to undramatic and painstaking gathering of evidence andthe high level of co-operation between all parts of theSecurity Forces, people were charged in 1979 withterrorist offences and were convicted of terroristcrimes.   Taking terrorists out of circulation through the2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALprocesses of the law remains the Security Forces&apos; chiefweapon in their fight against terrorism.504. The  ~ j awards for gallantry in Northern Ireland madeto members of the Armed Services in 1979 offer furthertestimony to the continuing courage and tenacity with whichthey have carried out their duties.   A particularly hazardoustask is carried out by the small number of Ammunition TechnicalOfficers (ATOs) and their teams, who have the task of dealingwith terrorist explosive devices.   In 1979 the number ofincidents, both shootings and bombings, remained at much thesame level as in 1978, but the amount of explosive used increasedSeven hundred and fifty-ninesignificantly.       .        incidents involving explosives wererecorded.   One of these, at Kinawley Police Station in March,used about 1,000 lbs of explosive, the largest single devicesince 1969.   During the year the ATO teams disarmed 142devices   and   6,500   lbs of. explosive were recovered, mostlyfrom live devices.   Since 1969     17    members of these teamshave been killed in the course of their duties.      2 ofthem this year, and during 1979 /details of decorations_7wereawarded for this work.505. The appointment of Sir Maurice Oldfield as SecurityCo-ordinator was announced at the beginning of October lastyear.   His task is to assist the Secretary of State for -Northern Ireland in improving the co-ordination and effective-ness of the fight against terrorism in accordance with the3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALGovernment&apos;s security objectives.   Discussions with the IrishGovernment led to agreement on a number of measures designedto make more effective the efforts of both Governments tostamp out terrorism.506.   The Army force level remained at 13 major units of thecombat arms, of which 6 were resident, throughout 1979; atotal of 40 units served in the Province during the year,including one Royal Marines Commando in the infantry role.- fe-7 TheRoyal Navy and the Royal Air Force also contribute tooperations in Northern Ireland by offshore patrolling andair support.   The UDR provides immediate military support for&quot;Hie RDC in eleven Police Divisions.   Recruitment to implementthe build-up of the permanent cadre approved last year isgoing well.   Sixteen full-time platoons are now operational.The total strength at 1 January 1980, including both full-timeand part-time members, was  &quot;  j, of whom  &quot;    j were women.We hope for an early end to the emergency in Northern Ireland,with a consequent reduction in Service commitments.OTHER ACTIVITIES507.   The more familiar ways in which the Services put theirskills and training at the disposal of the civil communityinclude search and rescue, bomb disposal, protection of4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALoffshore resources and emergency assistance after naturaldisasters such as floods or blizzards.   Other services -needed primarily for defence purposes   also make an impactoe civil life, such as hydrography and the MeteorologicalOifice.   These activities are discussed in more detail below.508. In return for these and other direct contributions theymake to the safety and well-being of the community, theServices have to ask for tolerance and understanding ofnecessary military activities which affect people&apos;s everydaylives in less popular ways.   For example, they ask people toaccept that access to some countryside is restricted or deniedbecause it is needed for training or as a firing range. Theyask that those affected by low flying training, the need forwhich is discussed in Chapter 3, should accept the inconven-ience and risks in the interests of creating and maintainingessential military skills which contribute to ensuring thesecurity of the whole community.509. The Services are themselves part of the general community,and not in some way separate from it.   Their integration withtheir local community is not always easy, because many Servicepersonnel are required by their job to move often, and becausesome bases are in remote areas.   But   wherever they arestationed, the Services take a notable part in local eventsand charities and in contributing to the local community.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALBomb Disposal510. In the last year bomb disposal teams have responded toover  &quot;    j requests for assistance from police in Britain.The most serious incident was the spate of letter bombs inBirmingham during June 1979.Military Aid to the Civil Authorities511. Throughout the year the three Services have participatedin a variety of projects in aid of the civil community. Thesehave ranged from relief operations during bad weather to thedemolition of  old  buildings, _A and the loan of individualvolunteers to community projects.   The tasks draw on theexpertise and specialised equipment available from Servicesources to the benefit of the civil community, and also providevaluable training for the Servicemen.512. The Services&apos;major contribution to.an emergency ambulancservice during the ambulance drivers&apos; dispute which ended inApril 1979 demonstrated their flexibility in adapting tounfamiliar roles.   The decision to deploy Servicemen was taken]only as a last resort, to maintain the life of the community.Protection of Offshore Resources513*   Both the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force play animportant part in fishery protection.   The Fishery ProtectionSquadron of the Royal Navy consists of the Offshore Division6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfire Island class offshore-patrol vessels and the Coastal Division witheight Ton class mine countermeasures vessels /&quot;and the fastpa ;rol boat HMS Tenacity j.   Two additional vessels of theIsand class are also deployed from other naval duties asne essary.   Reconnaissance flights are made regularly byRAF Nimrod patrol aircraft and RN Sea Devons.   The main taskis to monitor fishing in Britain&apos;s extended fisheries limitsand to enforce fisheries legislation by examining catch, gearand nets to ensure that they are lawful.   In 1979 the RoyalNavy boarded /&quot; j British and foreign fishing vessels.514.   The RAF Nimrods based at Kinloss and St Mawgan have animportant part to play in fishery protection since it is onlyby aerial surveillance that the vast area of the United KingdomFishery Zone can be fully covered.   They maintain close contactwith fishery protection vessels in the area so that they candirect them towards any vessels suspected of illegal fishing.This combination of air and sea resources led to 24 convictionsbeing obtained in 1979 for a variety of offences by fishingvessels of various nationalities.515* As well as meeting their fishery protection tasks, theIsland class vessels and the Nimrod aircraftkeep watch over our offshore energy installations. Theseforces, together with other units of the Armed Forces, areavailable to respond to any offshore incident. Contingencyplans for responding to emergencies are tested regularly in7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALoffshore exercises.   On 1 May 1980 a new Royal Marines unitwill be formed and be available to reactto incidents on offshore oil and gas installations. Theairft- patrols also seek and report oil spillage and slicks,and ships and aircraft are often called on to investigate ordeter infringements of safety zones around offshoreinstallations.516. Some of the running costs for the Services&apos; offshoreprotection activities are met by other Government Departments.Search and Rescue517. Both the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force maintainhelicopters for short-range search and rescue (SAR) operations.Similarly, RAF Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft are onpermanent standby for incidents within the United KingdomSearch and Rescue Region  which extends 1,000 miles into heAtlantic .   Other Service resources (RN ships, RAF aircraft,marine craft and mountain rescue teams) are available to helpif needed.   The permanent SAR facilities are provided primarilyfor military operations, but most peacetime work is on ci iliai|rescue missions.   The SAR helicopter squadrons of the twoServices, which are stationed at thirteen bases, carried out^&quot;1 319,J7 missions during 1979, and rescued^&apos;&quot;l ,040_7 people.518. The most notable example of SAR by the Services in 1979was the part they played in the Fastnet Race rescue operations8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALngside the other rescue services, such as the LifeboatService.   A storm of exceptional ferocity caught 303 yachtsscattered across the South West approaches.   Sixteen heli-copters flew 212 hours on 71 life saving missions. Overthree days, RAF Nimrods flew a total of 110 hours in searcho.t yachts and crews, and six RN vessels also took part.Although 15 lives were lost, 139 survivors from 24 abandonedyachts were rescued altogether during an operation extendingover 20,000 square miles.Hydrography519.   The primary task of the Royal Navy&apos;s hydrographic fleetis to conduct surveys to meet defence requirements byproviding charts and oceanographic informationfor the Royal Navy and our NATO allies.But the hydrographic fleet also carries out civil hydrographic[tasks.   The waters around the United Kingdom are increasinglyused by very large deep-draught merchant vessels which needdetailed and up-to-date charts if they are to operate safely.[520.   In addition to producing charts and oceanographicInformation based on its own surveys, the Hydrographer&apos;sDepartment also uses data from other sources in producing.ts worldwide series of charts which meet a large proportion&gt;f the total world demand.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALMeteorology521.   The Meteorological Office makes, collects and distributesweather observations, prepares forecasts, provides meteoro-logical advice and undertakes research.   The basic activitiesare organised centrally for the benefit of all users, butspecialised support is provided for the Armed Forces, civilaviation, shipping, agriculture, energy and other industries, iieluding the offshore energy industry. The general public are sensthrough the news media and through Weather Centres in majorcities.   About one third of the cost of the Office is coveredby payments from non-defence users.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL6PERSONNEL,01*  Our defence capability depends on the quality andoamitment of the men and women of the Armed Forces and offee civilian staffs working with them.SERVICE PERSONNEL&gt;G2.   The Government believes that the men and women in theIrmed Forces have been under-valued in recent years. Their&gt;ay was allowed to fall well below the proper levels. Theylere called on to relieve the community of the worst effectsf industrial action, while the importance of their own workas not properly acknowledged.   It is a tribute to the esteem&quot;n which society holds the Forces that,, despite all this, soany young men and women were still prepared to serve with theolours; it is a tribute too to their courage, loyalty andndurance that the morale of the Services       survived soell in recent years.   Our volunteer Forces are a pricelessational asset.b3.   Full details of the recruitment, outflow and strengths]f the Services are given in Volume II of. this statement.-anpower Shortages34.   In 1977 and 1978 increasing numbers of experienced and1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwell qualified officers and Servicemen chose to leaveprematurely.   The Services could ill afford to lose them,especially as new equipment is technically sophisticatedand the procedures and tactics to exploit it are more complexthan ever before.   It will take many years to replace them,however many new recruits are enlisted.605.   A prime cause was dissatisfaction with pay, but this wasnot all.   The shortage, especially of skilled personnel, hadmeant that the remaining manpower resources had to beincreasingly overstretched .which in turn had increased theturbulence in the lives of Service personnel and theirfamilies.   Units were already required to meet commitments,in Northern Ireland, Belize and Cyprus, which had beenexpected to cease, or at least reduce in scale.   On top oithis, they had been called upon to maintain essential sen icesin three successive winters, of industrial disruption. Re-organisation and the introduction of new equipment had madeadditional demands.   For many this meant harder work, longerhours, more frequent and less predictable movement and increasefamily separation.   These factors inevitably played a par inindividual decisions to leave the Services.605.   On taking office last May   we found that the totalstrength of the Armed Forces, excluding Gurkhas and other-personnel recruited overseas, was 313,816.   The total oftrained Service personnel was 283,620, which was well below2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALths current requirement at that time.   The shortfall wasgreater than it had been at any time since 1970.6Q$    The Government acted at once.   Before and during theelection campaign we had promised to restore the Services&apos;pay to full comparability with that of their civiliancounterparts.   We did this immediately, and at the same timeundertook to maintain it thereafter at these levels.   In sodoing we accepted the concept of the &quot;Military Salary&quot; underwhich Service personnel are paid the proper rate for the job,and in turn pay a fair price for the food and accommodationprovided for them.   We also accepted that the Armed ForcesPay Review Body (AFFRB) should continue its independent workof assessing and recommending what levels of pay are appro-priate and what charges would be fair.608.   In recent years the Military Salary concept has beencriticised by the Services.   We believe this criticism wasunderstandable   but misplaced.   It was brought about because&quot;Government national counter-inflation measures interferedwith comparability.   Pay was set by reference to arbitrarynorms, not by reference to comparable outside earnings. Asa result. Service pay needed to be increased by an averageof 32% to bring it up to comparable civilian levels. Wewill allow the concept of the Military Salary based on theAFPRB recommendations to operate as it was intended^3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALand we believe that the Services should have every confide; cein it.   The Government believes that this provides thebest means of fulfilling the objective, which is to ensurethat the Services receive a fair reward and one that issufficient to attract and retain people of the high qualityneeded.Recruiting609. Recruiting in 1979/80 was generally good, and improvedafter the pay award.   Between April and October the level wassome 16% higher than in the same period in 1978.   An intakeof nearly 49.000 can be expected in 1979/80.   This compareswith some 43,400 in the preceding year, but is still shortof the number required.   Retention of personnel is also ofgreat importance, and the Government&apos;s moves on pay have hadan early impact in reducing the number of applications toretire prematurely.   This is an encouraging sign but thereis no certainty that the effect will be permanent.   It under-lines the need to keep pay and conditions of service undeicareful review.610. The general picture, however, masks shortages in socegrades and specialisations. We intend therefore to keep upour present recruiting effort, and to deal selectively withparticular shortages. Plans are in hand to re-organise therecruiting network in some areas on a tri-Service basis.611. The maximum requirement for trained personnel in themid-1980s will be 20,000 greater than the present trained4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALength.   To close the gap will require a sustained improve-t in both recruiting and retention over the next four toftiwe years.   Recruitment will be more difficult from 1982awards because there will be a declining number of young menentering the 16-19 age-range from which the Services normallyrecruit.   The Services currently recruit some &amp;i% of mensntsjring this age group but will need to recruit about 11-&amp;96lb? the end of the 1980s.   This will be a formidable task.Failure could undermine our ability to carry out majorlie fence tasks.   The Government must therefore make the bestof existing resources and exploit additional sources ofnanpower, including the Reserves, to the full.Dther Conditions of Service613.   Proper levels of pay, though essential, are not by them-selves enough.   We must also plan to create conditions ofservice which will retain our trained personnel and attractthe recruits needed.     The way of life of the Services mustcontinue to take account of developments in civilian life, notcnly in the pattern of financial rewards, but also reflectingchanging social trends and aspirations.   There will always becertain constraints on life in a disciplined service and weHaust as far as possible reconcile the legitimate interests bothT&gt;f the Services and of the individual.&gt;14.   Housing is, after pay, probably the most important factor.n the willingness of Servicemen to make a career in the Armedorces.   Some 52.% of Servicemen and 77% of officers arearried.   Of those who are married, a quarter of Servicemend two thirds of officers own a home.     Although forCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALoperational reasons the three Services adopt differentattitudes towards the housing of married personnel, noService can ignore their increasing and understandabledesire for home ownership.   Nevertheless, home ownershipis difficult to reconcile with the demands of Service life,especially in the Army and the Royal Air Force.        We arelooking at possible schemes which will help Service personnelto buy their own homes and at the same time make it easierfor them to accept the regular moving and travelling that theentails. In addition we are planning to introduce a scheme whichwill enable Service personnel to purchase surplus marriedquarters at a discount in line with the arrangements proposedunder the new Housing Bill.        &apos;.. _____The AFPRB willbe re-examining the basis of married quarter charges this /earto ensure that they are calculated in as fair a manner aspossible, bearing in mind the standstill of recent years.615.   Social, recreational and welfare facilities will alsobe important factors bearing on the willingness of Servicemenin future to live on base, whether in single or marriedaccommodation.   We shall try to preserve the unique qualitiesof mess and club life for those who want them,        to provideup-to-date living conditions and to satisfy a growing demandfor privacy and independence.    Barrack modernisation isa continuing process.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Reserves616    Chapter 3 emphasised the vital role that our Reserveswou&apos;Jd play in supporting the regular forces should the needarise   In a time of manpower shortage, the   Reserves areeve; more important.   We have implemented a series ofmeasures since coming into office to improve recruitingand retention of volunteer reservists and to improve theirmilitary capability.   We increased bounties, made plans toissue better equipment and launched a major recruiting drive.These measures have already had a favourable impact onmanpower trends in the volunteer reserves.617.   The Royal Navy is planning closer co-operation between[the regular Service and the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR). Thewill man the new mine-sweeping trawlers when they are7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcommissioned, and a reserve branch to the Fleet Air Arm isto be set up (see paragraph 347).618. The volunteer element of the Army reserve force is nowknown once again as the Territorial Army (TA). Equipmentissued to TA units in the last year includes the Fox armouredcar, the Light Gun and the Blowpipe air defence missile. Wehave set in hand an examination of TA equipment scales witha view to identifying areas for improvement.619. We have also announced an Individual Reinforcement Plandesigned to speed the mobilisation of the regular ArmyReservists who would, in emergency, supplement the regularforces and the TA.   The new arrangements require individualReservists to keep their uniform and some equipment at horn- ,and to report once a year to a local unit so that theirfitness, availability, uniform and equipment can be checker.An annual taxable reporting grant of  100 and travellingexpenses will be paid.   On mobilisation they will report toa local centre dedicated to the reinforcement of a specificformation.   This new scheme will halve the time needed tomobilise the Reservists concerned.620. The RAF Volunteer Reserve and Royal Auxiliary Air Force-play an important role in support of the Roya]Air Force.   In July 1979 three Royal Auxiliary Air ForceRegiment squadrons were formed to assist in the defence ofairfields in the United Kingdom.   Recruitment to these new8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsquadrons is being assisted considerably by the increasedrates of training bounty announced during 1979.Cadet Forces62m The importance of the Cadet Forces and the need todevelop the interest of young people between 11-18 in theForces has grown with the need to increase recruitment totha regular forces.   Large numbers of Sea Cadets are nowjoining the Royal Navy and Merchant Navy.   The same is truefor recruitment to the Army from the Army Cadet Force, butthe expanded interest shown by young boys has not beenreflected in the recruitment of Army Cadet Force officers,where there is still undermanning.   To broaden the base ofrecruitment, an experimental scheme has been started permit-ting girls to join a selected number of Army Cadet Forcedetachments in schools.   The Air Training Corps and RAFSections of the Combined Cadet Force continue to provide aI valuable source of high quality recruits for the Royal AirForce.   The Venture self-launching glider is now in operationat a number of air cadets gliding schools and is proving tobe of substantial benefit.THE WOMEN&apos;S SERVICES622.   The increasing importance of the reserve forces is tosome extent a product of the shortage of regular manpower.This in turn has underlined the need to look more closely at9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALalternative resources.   Prominent amongst these are theWomen&apos;s Services, which now total some 12,700 excluding thenursing element.   They work in the Services throughout theworld in a variety of ways, for the greater part in supportroles   such as the supply and communications fields.   As aresult there are few activities of the Services in whichthey are not involved; for instance, the force sent to SouthenRhodesia included some members of the Women&apos;s Royal ArmyCorps (WRAC).   However, integration has stopped short ofemploying women in combat roles, sending the Women&apos;s RoyalNaval Service (WRNS) to sea or using the Women&apos;s Royal AirForce (WRAF) as combat aircrew.623.   The Women&apos;s Services not only provide a valuable additioto the Services but have the advantage that in general they tfewer     recruiting problems.   In the past one major obstacleto their wider employment has been that their length ofservice is on average only half that for men; hence the iavesment in training them is more costly.   However, the averagespan of women&apos;s service is increasing and,in parallel, thecase for giving Service women more expensive forms of trainibecomes more convincing.   This is likely to put pressure onthe training organisations and thus the scope for immediateincreases in the size of the Women&apos;s Services is limitedBut there is every prospect that a phased increase ispracticable.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2f| Some changes are already planned.   The Royal Navy isXanning to employ WRNS officers in a wider range ofI; ^cialisations and to assign WRNS ratings to shore wirelessmd electronic maintenance posts.   Earlier this year the Armymihorised a further 570 posts to be filled by the WRAC ince of men, and has proposals to increase the size of theJAG by 25% in the next five years.   The Royal Air ForceAlready &apos;employs women in a wide range of jobs and plans tose them more in future.18 Arming of Women25.   If, however, we are to be able to make the fullest usef women in the Services, we must reconsider and perhapsevise our traditional attitude to allowing them to bear arms, .though women ~| went    into uniform to support the Armedfcrces during both World Wars, they were not employed on the^pe of duties for which the carriage of*arms was necessary,e Women&apos;s Services are   however   now established on atgular footing, and we are looking to them to play ancreasing part in the work of our Armed Forces. Moreover,the Armed Forces of an increasing number of countries -Including Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France and the Netherlandsmen are now being trained in the use of firearms for self-fence, or for certain limited base defence tasks in an .prgency.   So far, we in this country have made no similarve.   As a result,   for example, employment opportunities11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfor members of the WRAC cannot be widened forward of theCorps rear boundary in BAOR, and members of the WRAF cannotbe detailed for certain guard duties in an emergency whichwould permit much greater flexibility in the use of RAFpersonnel.626. Although the Geneva Conventions make no distinctionbetween men and women, so that both sexes (other than thoseengaged on medical duties) must already be considered to be&quot;combatant11, the Government believes that for the presentthere can be no question of members of the Women&apos;s Servicesengaging in combat   or being armed   for any duties other thanin exercises, jgps emergency or war.   Within this generallimitation, however, we. are considering how far it would nowbe desirable to go.   If arming women with personal weapon?at all is acceptable, questions which must be resolved in ludewhether it should be limited, as in some, countries, to self-defence or whether, as in others, it might be extended to abase defence role; whether arming should be voluntary orcompulsory; and whether reserved rights should be offered toexisting members of the Women&apos;s Services.627. Although the Government sees no reason of principle todistinguish between any of the Women&apos;s Services in a matterof this kind, the practical involvement of the WRNS is unlikelyto be immediate.   Male Royal Navy personnel carry arms onlyrarely (when, for example, they form part of a ship&apos;s or12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALestablishment&apos;s security patrol).   It follows that wideremployment of WRNS is not critically dependent on armingth a.   As a quite separate question, the Royal Navy isexamining the scope for employing WRNS on operational duties,short of combat, to relieve manpower shortages and improvethair career opportunities.CIVILIAN PERSONNEL628.   The Ministry of Defence&apos;s civilian staff provide anessential contribution to the defence effort both in Britainand worldwide.   The all-volunteer Armed Forces cannot functioneffectively, and in some respects cannot function at all,without the supporting civilian staffs.   Civilians, oftenworking directly alongside their Service colleagues, areinvolved in all aspects of defence activity.   They contributeto defence policy making; manage equipment projects; directresearch and development programmes,&apos; train Servicemen in manyessential skills,* and provide the craft skills needed in theRoyal Ordnance Factories to produce military equipment, inthe Royal Dockyards to repair and refit the Royal Navy&apos;sships and submarines, and in the Research and Developmentestablishments to which we look to match and counter Soviettechnological advances.   On the operational side civilianstaff help to maintain the Army&apos;s fighting vehicles and RAFoperational aircraft, run the meteorological services onwhich all three Services rely and man the Royal Fleet13CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALAuxiliaries which supply the Royal Navy at sea in peace andwar.629. It is often not appreciated how wide is the range ofskills demanded of the Ministry of Defence&apos;s civilian staff.A total of /~277,000_7 civilians are employed at present. Ofthese, 37,000 are locally engaged overseas.   The remainder -the 240,000 UK-based staff - represent nearly one third of theCivil Service, but they do not match the popular image ofWhitehall bureaucrats.   About half of them, including highlyskilled craftsmen, are in the industrial grades and are mainlydeployed in the Dockyards, Royal Ordnance Factories, supplydepots, aircraft maintenance units, workshops and so on.Scientists, engineers, technologists and other specialists,such as teachers, computer processing staff, policemen andcommunications experts, make up a further quarter; these arethe staff who provide the high technical input to the researchand development and equipment programmes, help to run keycomputer installations, teach Service children overseas, guardMinistry of Defence establishments and maintain and operatecrucial worldwide communications networks.   Figure 18illustrates the wide spread of jobs, and shows that no morethan h% of Ministry of Defence civilians are employed in theadministrative and executive grades.630. Since coming into office last year, we have been muchimpressed by the commitment of the civilian defence staffsand by how closely they identify with the role of the ArmedForces.   Despite the dissatisfaction and discontent which bad14CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALbuilt up over a long period preceding last year&apos;s pay settle-ment, civilians in the Ministry of Defence continued todemonstrate a very considerable degree of commitment to thesupport of the Armed Forces.      The Government recognises thatthl loyalty and high morale of the Ministry&apos;s civilian staffsare no less important than those of the Services and will doall that it can to ensure that relations do not again sink tothe level of last year, with the enormous strains which thisimposed upon   the loyalty of the civilian staff.Civilian Numbers631.   Continuing pressure on the defence budget has for manyyears forced upon the Department the need for the closestcontrol of staff numbers, both Service and civilian. Between1964 (when the unified Ministry of Defence was formed) and 1979civilian staff numbers, excluding the ROFs, were reduced by150,000.   Ministry of Defence Headquarters numbers, Service andcivilian, are expected to have fallen by about     13*5% between1 April 1974 and 1 April 1980, and further reductions areplanned.   The fall in Headquarters numbers included a cutbetween 1974 and 1979 in senior Civil Servant numbers (UnderSecretaries and above) from    126 to 112 .     This was a sizeablereduction by any standards, but no organisation as large as theMinistry of Defence can ever be satisfied that it has preciselythe right number of staff with just the right skills in all theplaces where they are needed.   The organisation must be flexibleand able to respond to changing needs; staffing levels andrecruitment targets must be closely monitored and controlled;and there is a need to ask critically whether it is Tight for15CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCivil Servants to be carrying out all their present functionsor whether some of them could and should be contracted out.632. When the Government took office it had to take immediateaction to control cash limits in the wake of the substantialpay settlements of 1979.   Accordingly a recruiting ban wasimposed from May to August 1979 throughout the Civil Serviceaimed at reducing wage-related expenditure by 3%    The banapplied to the Ministry of Defence as to all other departments.However, to ensure that essential defence work was not under-mined, exemptions from the ban were granted for a number ofkey grades, such as professional engineers, scientists, ADIspecialists, craftsmen, police and security staff.633. The ban did not of itself cut back numbers sufficientlyand further selective recruiting restraints had to be imposedfor the remainder of the year.   As a result the provision forUK-based civilian numbers will have been-reduced by some 6r700in the year ending 31 March 1980 and the target will have beenmet; the provision for ROF numbers will also have fallen byabout 1,600 over the same period.   Together these represent areduction of rather more than 3%.   The estimates for 1980/81provide for the 3% reduction to be continued and efforts willbe made to correct the uneven incidence of the reductions whicliinevitably occurred in different parts of the Department. Actiis also being taken to rationalise the cutback by ensuring thatresources and tasks are matched, and by identifying16CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthi work to be given up or modified where this is necessary.63-lj   Soon after it was elected   the Government launched aradical review of Civil Service activities aimed at identi-fy ag possible savings from improved efficiency and fromth3 curtailment or elimination of functions.   All departmentswere asked to identify options for achieving these aims.When the Ministry of Defence had completed this exercise,the Government took the view that a reduction of 7,500 by1982 (on top of the similar saving to be made as a result ofthe recruiting restraint) was the maximum commitment whichcould be made, in advance of detailed studies of certainmajor areas of activity, without harming the defence effort.Three short term studies were commissioned - contract cleaningand catering, quality assurance and bill paying - and threelonger term ones - the Royal Dockyards, research and developmentand supply management.   Chapter 8 describes the studies inmore detail.635.   The three short term studies have been completed andimplementation of the recommendations will achieve the bulkof the 7,500 saving and provide as good a service, and insome cases a better one, at lower cost./&quot;Any balance required willhowever  be found by implementing a number of smaller measuresidentified earlier ,j The three longer termstudies are also examining whether savings can be made,whether work is being carried out in the most economical and17CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcost effective way and whether the balance of in-house andcontract work is right.   No manpower targets have been setfor these studies because the imposition of arbitrary targetsis not a sensible way to proceed.   There will   however   be acontinuing search for economy in the use of manpower, bothService and civilian, during the coming years to ensure thatthe high skill and professionalism of the staff who work forthe Ministry of Defence are used in an efficientand fully productive way.Recruitment636*   It follows from this that there is, and will continueto be, a need for men and women of high calibre to supportand assist the Armed Forces.   The high average age of importantelements of our civilian staff, which will produce a high levelof retirement over the next few years, will place even greateremphasis on the need to recruit and keep&apos; good people.   As withServicemen, the Ministry of Defence has for some time beerexperiencing serious problems in recruiting and retainingcertain types of staff with the right qualities in sufficientnumbers.   This has been particularly true in the fields ofelectronics, avionics and computer technology, where thedifficulty in recruiting and retaining specialist staff imposesignificant restraints on the defence equipment .programme..The production of weapons, ammunition and other essentialequipment is affected by the national shortage of qualified18CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcx aftsmen which is felt particularly in areas where there iskesn competition from private industry.   Establishments suchas the Royal Dockyards, where craft grades constitute moreth|a half of the industrial work-force, are affected veryse/erely.   There is a national shortage of experiencedcomputer programmers and systems analysts, from which theMinistry of Defence is not immune.   Nor can enough qualifiedaccountants be recruited and retained.   /&quot;In Scotland wecannot compete with the high rates offered by the oil companiesand in central London the recruitment and retention of staffis difficult in the face of the more attractive pay and fringebenefits offered by other employers and because of the highcost of commuting.J7637.   One way of tackling this problem is from the demand endby ensuring that work within the Department is carried out inthe most economical way and that the Ministry of Defence doesnot do work which can more sensibly be carried out elsewhere.This is under examination, but it is equally important totackle the supply end, and this too is being done. TheMinistry of Defence operates schemes to sponsor undergraduateengineers and to encourage promising craftsmen who havecompleted their apprenticeships to undertake training todegree level.   Teams from the Royal Dockyards have travelledround the country to try to recruit craftsmen. Potentialmanagement accountants and computer specialists are selectedfrom among our executive and clerical staff and trained19CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALin-house.   Suitable craftsmen are promoted into theprofessional and technical grades.   There is a considerablegap to he made good but it is hoped that these measures,/&quot;&quot;together with the recent pay settlement(s) ,_7 will helpto close it.638.   There are also internal measures which can be and arebeing taken.   In middle and senior grades staff will be keptin their specialisation and in specific jobs for longer toursof duty so that the Department can make the most of theirexperience and expertise.   Continued efforts will be madeto develop &quot;home-grown&quot; specialists in such key areas ofcivilian employment as contracts, management accounting,financial and personnel management.   Apprentices are neededin large numbers to maintain the strength of our technicalorganisations in the future; they are the craftsmen of a fewyears hence.   The Ministry of Defence has an annual intakof some 2,300 apprentices and currently has 8,000 men andwomen under training.   Apprentices, like other keygrades, were exempted from the recruiting restraints.6 39.   The Ministry of Defence, as employer of  &quot;       j staffperforming management tasks, must reflect the increasingspecialisation seen in the commercial and industrial world,and accept that very few people can perform in a wide rangeof jobs with equal effectiveness.   It is to this end that theDepartment began in 1979 to base the career development of20CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALits       ,000_7 executive staff on five specialised functions -AD?, Finance, Personnel Management, Procurement and SupplyMeaagement.   The next step is to extend this to more seniorgrades.   Increased professionalism also requires much effortto be devoted to training which is closely job oriented.Over 7,000 civilians attended central or external coursesduring the year and many more attended courses in linemanagement areas as part of a training patternwhich is constantly being updated.   Greater interchangebetween staff in the Ministry of Defence and industry,especially defence contractors, will also benefit both sidesas a result of the exchanges of ideas and approaches.   It isintended to encourage such interchange much more in future.Pax640.  Ministry of Defence civilians are part of the Civil[Service, the pay of which has long been based primarily onthe principle of fair comparison with staffs employed outsidethe Civil Service on broadly comparable work.   The payresearch procedures mean following the market, not leading it.rhe present basis of comparability for determining CivilService pay was laid down 25 years ago in the report of thePriestley Commission. Some factors which then led people to[join the Civil Service may no longer apply, and there may now3e a much more direct connection between recruitment and ratespf pay.   The Government found when it took office that for a21CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnumber of reasons the pay and conditions of service whichthe Ministry was able to offer were in some key areasinsufficient to attract and retain all the staff neededfor defence programmes*   For 3% of the 4 years followingthe 1975 Civil Service pay settlements   further pay increaseswere kept strictly within the limits allowed by the lastGovernment&apos;s pay policy.   By the time of the 1979 settlementsCivil Service pay had fallen well behind that of comparableoutside employers.   The return to comparable rates for 1979has been approved and the last stage will be met for theindustrial Civil Service on 1 April 1980.      The outsiderates meanwhile will have themselves moved on during thisperiod.      A   further pay research exercise for non-industrials]is nearing completion and one for industrials will shortly getunder way.641.   The Ministry does a great deal to train people forcertain specialisations (ADP, engineering, craftsmen) onlyto find too often that they leave for outside employment.Possible ways to redress this situation are under constantstudy.   For industrial employees a national structure of basicpay and conditions is supplemented by productivity andincentive schemes applied to particular localities. Additionaschemes have been introduced, and others brought up to date,/&quot;important negotiations are going on for a new dockyardefficiency scheme for the four Royal Dockyards in Britain._7More generally the search is continuing for ways of giving22CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmore authority to the major line managers, with a matchingfiaancial responsibility.Industrial Relations642. Because of the importance of civilian staff to theMinistry of Defence and to national security, it is essentialnow to maintain a climate in which industrial relations arebased on mutual respect and goodwill rather than suspicion.643. In a Ministry employing such a large number of staffperforming a vast range of tasks, good relationships betweenpeople with different backgrounds doing different types ofwork and between civilians and Service personnel are vitalto successful management.   Open and effective communicationsand genuine consultation with and between staff at all levelsthroughout the organisation play an essential role. Toprovide more effective means for this, important changesin the consultative arrangements for bringing non-industrialstaff and management together have been introduced sincethe middle of 1978.   Two new top level Whitley CouncilCommittees have been set up to deal with major matters oforganisation policy and personnel management.   The WhitleyCommittee for the Procurement Executive has been re-organisedand a new Headquarters London Whitley Committee is being setjup to fill a gap in the coverage of the consultative machinery.The Whitley Committee arrangements at Army District and NavalBase levels are also under review jointly with the Departmental23CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL7EQUIPMENT701, The defence procurement programme is a vast and long-term undertaking.   The largest projects can cost well over abillion pounds and take ten years or longer to develop.Introduction into service may be spread over five or moreyears with a service life of fifteen years or more thereafter.Decisions taken today must take account of the threat to NATOand the United Kingdom which is likely to arise in the 1990sand beyond, and they must try to foresee and exploit theadvanced technologies of the next decade in responding tothat threat.   Equipment must be designed to allow for furtherimprovements during its life as technology develops.702. The need for a new item of defence- equipment may reflecta variety of Influences: existing equipment is obsolescent orno longer in production; intelligence has identified a newthreat; research offers new solutions; technological advancescan be exploited; new proposals by industry&apos; or equipmentsplanned by our allies may offer significant operationaladvantages.   Each equipment project typically goes through anumber of stages - feasibility study, project definition,full development and production. At appropriate stages, highlevel committees assess both the operational justification1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALand the characteristics of a proposed equipment, and examinthe technological, budgetary and resource implications.They consider how best to procure the equipment: througha national project, collaboration with allies or purchasefrom abroad.   They also review projects if at any time theris a significant increase in the real cost, in the time neeto complete the work or if other circumstances, such as thethreat, should change markedly.   They consider whether therequirement is still valid and examine any problems that mayhave arisen, before recommending whether the project shouldcontinue.703. Against this general background, the equipment budget,the more significant projects and important elements ofprocurement policy are discussed in this chapter.THE EQUIPMENT BUDGET *704. Expenditure on equipment in 1980/81 is planned to be . &quot;     j million and will absorb  &quot;  j% of the defencebudget.   This compares with 1979/80 forecast expenditure atthe same price level of  . &quot;     j million, which represented41% of the 1979/80 defence budget.705. When personnel and other costs are added in, totalprocurement expenditure for 1980/81 is estimated at  . &quot;million.   l ~       j million will be for research and2CONFIDENTIAL

Figure     19     shows the main divisionsof tie procurement programme and an analysis of the productionelement.THE EQUIPMENT PROGRAMME70k.   The sections that follow describe the main elements ofthe planned equipment programme in the principal fields ofwarfare.   Where one equipment contributes to more than onecapability, it is described under its primary function.Land Warfare70?.   The Warsaw Pact&apos;s ability to conduct offensive operationson land is growing, with more and better equipment.   The mainemphasis is on mobility, firepower, armoured protection andnight-fighting capability.   Large numbers of sophisticatedmodern tanks and armoured personnel carriers are in servicewith -tiie Soviet Army and even better tanks are being developed.A Warsaw Pact attack on NATO territory in central Europewould be spearheaded by concentrated armoured thrusts withpowerful air support.   Tank and infantry formations would besupported by heavy concentrations of artillery and engineerequipments designed to speed forward progress.   Air supportwould include several hundred advanced helicopter gunships.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALFurthermore Soviet forces could make intensive use of  electronic warfare and have large stocks of chemical munitions,1&amp;2.   To counter this threat NATO needs a wide range of weaponsystems which can defeat armour at all ranges, as well asartillery and air defence.   Efficient systems for command andcontrol J the ability to redeploy forces as the battle developsand to match the Warsaw Pact&apos;s night-fighting capability*electronic warfare equipmentJ reconnaissance and targetacquisition systems;and secure logistic support are alsoessential.   The United Kingdom is making improvements in allthese areas.7&amp;\.   Armour and Anti-Armoura. Chieftain now has an improved fire controlsystem coming into service to increase thepossibility of a first time hit against a movingtarget.   Modifications are being introduced toimprove the reliability of the engine and animproved armour piercing round will be introducedin the next few years.b. Future Tank Plans.   Future tank requirementsare receiving particular attention in the lightof current assessments of the Warsaw Pact tankthreat, while project definition studies of anew main battle tank for the longer term arecontinuing.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALc. Anti-Tank Guided Weapons (ATGW).   By the endof 1980 all the mechanised battalions of BAOR willbe equipped with the Milan medium-range ATGW. Thefuture night sight for Milan has been.selected andis being developed for adoption by France, theFederal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom.A night/all-weather sight is shortly to be intro-duced for the Swingfire ATGW.   The American TOWlong-range ATGW will be fitted to the Lynx helicopterin the early 1980s to form a formidable anti-tanksystem.   Preliminary studies have started on thenext generation of ATGW in collaboration withFrance and the Federal Republic of Germany.d. Light Anti-Armour Weapon (LAW).   This man-portable short-range unguided weapon is beingdeveloped in Britain to replace the Carl Gustavrecoilless anti-tank gun and the M72 rocket in theearly 1980s.   It is being developed to meet therequirement of the independent European ProgrammeGroup for such a weapon, and will be available foradoption by other NATO countries.Artillery and Associated Equipmenta.    FH 70 and SP 70.   The FH 70 towed howitzeris entering service and has been deployed to. itsfirst regiment.

In1979 the United Kingdom, United States, Franceand the Federal Republic of Germany signed aMemorandum of Understanding for the co-operativeprocurement of MLRS.   It will consist of atracked self-propelled armoured rocket launchercarrying 12 rockets and is designed for depthfire against important targets behind the immed-iate combat zone.   It is planned to enter servicewith the British Army in the mid-1980s.c. Supervisor.   An unmanned miniature helicoptersystem has been under study and project definitionfor some years to meet the Army&apos;s requirement formedium range surveillance and target acquisition.This project has now been cancelled in the lightof a reassessment of the development needed andits cost.   Alternative means of meeting the Army&apos;srequirement are being studied.71 L.   Infantry Equipmenta.    Mechanised Combat Vehicle (MCV).   Part ofthe present fleet of armoured personnel carriersis due to be replaced in the mid-1980s. Develop-ment has begin in the United Kingdom of a vehicle(MCV 80) to fit this requirement.   However, theUnited States is also developing an Infantry6CONFIDENTIAL

NATO will announce this yearthe result of trials to select a new standardcalibre for future personal weapons. Britishweapons of this calibre will become availablein the mid 1980s.712..   Low Level Air Defence.   Substantial improvements areplanned in the low-level air defence systems in servicewith the Army and the Royal Air Force.   Full development isunder way of a programme to incorporate the latest micro-processor technology into the Rapier missilesystem, while project definition work has begun on furtherpossible improvements. A tracked version ofRapier is being evaluated for the Army.   Similar programmesare being considered to improve the effectiveness of theBlowpipe man-portable missile.713.   Chemical Warfare Defensive Equipment.   We are developingnew equipment to improve our defences against chemical attack.This includes excellent new protective suits and respirators[which should greatly reduce the strain which present equipment[places on fighting Servicemen.   We are also developing a newCONFIDENTIAL

Work has begun on lengtheningthe fuselages of RAF Hercules transport aircraft.This will increase their troop- and freight-carryingcapacity and is equivalent to adding new aircraftto the present fleet, without the need for additionalcrews, ground support and so on.   It is thereforea very cost-effective way of improving the capacityof our air transport force.b. Helicopters.      The Royal Air Force helicopterforce is to be improved and reorganised andtwo squadrons of Chinooks will be provided in theArmy support role.   Thirty-three of these heli-copters are being produced in the United States withBritish avionics and the first should enter serviceby the end of the year.   They will provide a muchneeded increase in lift capability over that ofthe Wessex helicopters which they are replacing.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALAir Operations in Support of Land Warfare715.   In any attack on NATO, the Warsaw Pact would mountvery powerful air operations against NATO defences and otherimportant targets.   Warsaw Pact forces have acquired newervariants of tactical aircraft for ground attack, air defenceand reconnaissance, and are likely to introduce still moreeffective aircraft in the next ten years.   In the event ofconflict in the Central Region, the task of the Royal AirForce and of other allied air forces will be to thwart theattack from the air; to assist the Army by attacking enemyground forces, especially tanks; and to carry the battle tothe enemy by striking his airfields, bases and supply areas,by disrupting his communications and by inhibiting thedeployment of second echelon armies.a.     Tornado GR1.   The keystone of the programmeis the all-weather Tornado GR1 which will replacethe Vulcan, Buccaneer and Canberra.   It is now infull production and 146 have so far been orderedfor the Royal Air Force out of a total plannedorder of 220.   The first production aircraft willenter service with the Royal Air Force later thisyear.   The Tornado GR1 is being produced jointlyby the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic ofGermany and Italy.

Weare discussing the possibilities for a collabor-ative Tactical Combat Aircraft project with otherEuropean countries.   It had originally beenenvisaged that such an aircraft would, for theRoyal Air Force, replace both the Jaguar and theHarrier in about 1990.   Studies have howevershown that it would not be practicable at reason-able cost to meet the full range of performancerequirements by a single aircraft.d.     Harrier.   We plan to improve the Harrierto enable it to remain in service to the end ofthe century.   Consideration is being given towhether the AV8B aircraft being developed forthe US Marine Corps or the GR Mark 5 currentlybeing designed by British Aerospace could meetthe requirement for this improved Harrier.toCONFIDENTIAL

It will be carriedby the Tornado GR1, Harrier, Jaguar and, in duecourse, the TCA.      The United Kingdom, inco-operation with the United States, is continuingto develop an advanced airfield attack weapon.Land Based Air Defence71     The Soviet Union has large numbers of aircraft capableof attacking the United Kingdom, including Fencer fighterbombers and increasing numbers of Backfire bombers. Usingextensive electronic countermeasures, they can attack over awide range of heights and speeds with various free-fall andstand-off weapons.   Throughout the 1980s, their ability toprotect themselves and to launch longer-range weapons islikely to improve.   The Royal Air Force-must defend UnitedKingdom airspace and the vital sea and air reinforcementroutes against this threat.a.    Tornado F2.   The Tornado F2 is the air defenceversion of the Tornado which is being developedfor the Royal Air Force.   It will be capable oflong-range interception,      sustained combat airpatrol and      rapid Interception from ground alert.&quot;Its principal armament will be Sky Flash and AIM 9Lair-to-air missiles; it will also be fitted withIICONFIDENTIAL

Their aircraft can attack in largenumbers at subsonic and supersonic speeds and from low orhigh altitude, and the Soviet air-to-surface missilecapability will improve, particularly with the build up ofthe Backfire bomber force.   To combat this we need to deployseveral effective layers of defence.   Air defence fightersoppose enemy aircraft before they can accurately engage ourships.   Naval vessels are equipped with area air defencemissiles, which destroy enemy missiles before they get closeto their objective, and point defence missiles, which destroymissiles that have nearly reached their objective,a.

Commanders at all levels need to cope with the increasingcomplexity and speed of modern warfare as well as the diversity,longer range and greater destructive powers of modern weapons.To enable them to do so   they need up-to-date communication,command and control techniques.

The job of developing and producing equipment to meetthe needs of the Services is shared between the Government&apos;sown research and development (R &amp; D) establishments andindustry, whether in the public or private sector. Theextensive capabilities they offer help the Services to definethe technical characteristics of the equipment they need, tochoose between alternative solutions and to test and acceptequipment.     They enable Britain to develop national projectsor contribute to collaborative ones to meet defence needs ina cost-effective way.73Much of the  . &quot;      J million to be spent on equipmentin the coming financial year falls to important high technologyindustries.   For instance, over 20% of the output of the29CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALelectronics industry in 1978/79 was taken by the Ministry of Deand over 6096 of work in the aerospace industry is for defencepurposes.73S.   The defence equipment programme sustains about 200,000job opportunities within the major defence industries, andabout the same number again are sustained indirectly elsewhenin industry.   By providing most of the equipment the Servicesneed from our national resources and through collaboration,we keep to the minimum the proportion we buy from abroad.Sales of British defence equipment abroad contribute to thebalance of payments and generate further returns for thenation on the capital invested in research and development.736&apos;   The ability to develop and produce arms is thus animportant national asset.   It ensures supply; it enablesBritish Service requirements to be met in an appropriate andtimely way; it provides domestic employment; it can be paidfor in our own currency; it enables us to collaborate, wherethat is our preferred course; and it offers the prospect ofsecuring foreign exchange through sales.   Above all, becauseof its contribution to our defence, it helps maintain ournational security.        The Government intends therefore togive full support to British industry in providing thesebenefits.   In return, we look to industry to develop andproduce equipment of the desired quality, in the quantitiesrequired and at the time expected, in a cost-effective way.ZoCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCOLLABORATION73?,   In recent years Britain has to an increasing extentcollaborated with other countries in the development of majornew weapon systems.   Overheads and risks are sometimes toogreat for us to carry alone, because our production needs aresmall.   By collaborating with others who have similar require-ments we can share the burdens.   We now have in service or inprospect a generation of major systems (Tornado and Jaguaraircraft, Martel missiles, Anglo/French helicopters, FH 70and SP 70 howitzers) which have been developed bilaterallywith France or trilaterally with the Federal Republic ofGermany and Italy.   In each case the decision to enter intoa collaborative project has been taken following an examina-tion of alternative courses, such as a wholly national projector the adoption of some other country&apos;s equipment either bydirect purchase or for manufacture under* licence. Some7% of our equipment budget is spent on nationalcontracts placed with British industry, about    15 % asour share of collaborative projects, and    10%    on contractsplaced overseas.   Only a small percentage of our procurementexpenditure does not contribute directly to the British economy.73?.   The general arguments in favour of collaboration havebeen reinforced by the need seen in the Alliance for increasedstandardisation and interoperability of equipment.   The UnitedKingdom&apos;s response to this has been to intensify efforts to31CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALidentify collaborative prospects.   By jointly financing anddeveloping      new systems, we can reduce the numbers ofdifferent types of equipment and the extent of duplicateddevelopment in the Alliance.   At the same time we must ensurethat British industry retains a sufficient share of developmentwork on national and collaborative projects to maintain itsbasic capability.   Standardisation, if that were the onlyconsideration, could be most simply achieved by adoptingAmerican equipment.   Certain requirements can indeed be met bybuying equipment from abroad and we shall continue to do sowhen appropriate.   But the Government considers that it isimportant to retain in Europe, where we offer major expertise,a development capability for modern weapon systems, and wointend to strengthen European equipment co-operation. Studieson several major future weapon systems are being pursuedcollaboratively.73ff.   We are working closely with our European allies in theindependent European Programme Group to identify projects onwhich we can work together.   It is now more widely accepted inUnited States that it is necessary to maintain a European deferindustrial capability and to develop a more balanced relation-ship in defence equipment trade across the Atlantic. Thepresent United States Administration has encouraged hopes thatEuropean equipments will be adopted by United States forces.Such decisions and more transatlantic co-operation in developi3Z.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnew equipments are certainly needed if NATO is to reduceduplication of development effort, increase standardisationand give real meaning to the concept of the &quot;two-way street&quot;.Transatlantic co-operation is beginning to bear fruit.European countries are participating with the United Statesin the MLRS project   , and the United States is participatingin the British development of an airfield attack weapon .740.   The process of analysis and consultation must beginearly in a collaborative project.   If it does not, there islittle chance of the participating nations reaching agreementin time on all the military, industrial and economic factors.The discussions must begin well before the equipment is neededin service, and also before national development plans becometoo firm to be altered.     The United Kingdom strongly supportsthe groups within NATO which examine the possibilities ofequipment co-operation.   We also support-efforts to improvelanning procedures so that potential impediments to collabora-tion are identified early and tackled resolutely.4|.   Nevertheless, the decision to collaborate on even anpparently simple piece of equipment can involve substantialomplications and constraints.   The operational requirementsd planned dates for introducing the equipment into servicef the different national Service staffs are unlikely to &apos;atch exactly.   Compromise will often be necessary if ancceptable joint programme is to be negotiated.     The workZ3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALand cost sharing aspects may present difficulties. Collabora-tion will almost certainly increase the total cost of &quot;theproject because all national requirements must be accommodatedand the various elements of the project may, for national reasonot be divided out in the most cost-effective way.   But withmore countries to share the burden, the cost to each partici-pant should still be cheaper than that of a purely nationalproject.   It must be recognised frankly that national interestsand capabilities differ.   After the most exhaustive effortsit may still prove impossible to agree on a division of workthat matches each nation&apos;s industrial objectives or itspotential investment in the project.   Moreover, we must judgethe benefits of collaboration even more severely in projectswhere large numbers of an equipment with low development costsare needed.   The economic and industrial advantages ofcollaboration are then less evident, though the operationaladvantages of standardisation and common logistics must stillbe weighed.   Finally, national development avoids the potential,restrictions that could apply to third-party sales whendevelopment is undertaken with a partner.74Z.   Collaboration is not an end in itself. Individualprocurement decisions must be judged against our primaryobjective of getting the equipment the Services need at theright time and at the right price.   But where the conditionsare right, the Government will continue to seek collaboration.24CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSuccessful collaboration offers long-term political, technicaland military advantages which it is in our interests and thoseof our partners to secure.RESEARCH4?    A vigorous research effort is fundamental to equipmentrocurement.   It provides the information needed for decisionsibout future equipment requirements and how to meet them, andt underpins the design and development of equipment. Theesearch programme therefore aims to cover a wide spectrum ofcience and technology relevant to defence and to stimulateflow of new ideas.44\   In 1980/81 the research programme is expected to cost aboutif _7millioii. :I-This includes work done within the Government&apos;s ownesearch and Development (R &amp; D) establishments, in industry and inhe universities.   The programme covers a wide range, from work onew composite materials for high performance aircraft toevices for improving the ability of divers to performifficult tasks at great depths.   The programme consistsainly of applied research, but greater emphasis is now beingllaced upon the longer-term innovative and experimental workneeded to develop new technological capabilities.   In addition,ftudies and assessments are made to help the Services formulatepiecific staff targets and operational requirements. Thenistry of Defence also manages research programmes for otherggjCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALGovernment Departments on repayment, where military and civiltechnologies gain mutual benefit from common programmes orrequire the same expensive capital facilities. Examplesinclude work on civil aircraft, air&apos;traffic control, non-military space, marine navigation and shipping control.745. The work in each major area of the research programmeis reviewed regularly with the Services and other customersconcerned.   Every year a senior committee reviews the balanceof the programme as a whole to ensure that it fully reflectsthe priorities of the Services.   Independent advice on theresearch programme is obtained from the universities andindustry.746. The research staffs regularly consult, collaborate andexchange information with our allies, so that together wecan use scarce resources more economically, share knowledgeand identify promising areas of research.   For example, anumber of NATO countries recently co-operated in a programmeto measure infra-red propagation under various geographicaland climatic conditions in Europe.   The information gainedand shared will be of value in designing new equipments andpredicting their performance.747. The R&amp;D establishments work very closely with defenceindustry.   Research staffs circulate reports of their workwidely through industry and new ideas from the establishmentsare transferred rapidly to industry through research contractCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALFiras make extensive use of the facilities available atR&amp;D establishments.   But the results of defence researchmay be of much wider value.   For example, work at the RoyalSiga&amp;ls and Radar Establishment, Malvern, on liquid crystalsI (which won the Queen* s Award for Technological Achievementin i979) has yielded improved materials employed in electronicdisplays and now very widely found in consumer goods such ascalculators and watches, while work at the Chemical DefenceEstablishment, Porton Down, on charcoal filters has beenapplied in medical and other fields.74$,   As part of the Government&apos;s search for economy and &apos;efficiency a major study is being made of the functions ofthe defence R&amp;D establishments.   It will consider whethermore work could or should be undertaken by industry and theuniversities, taking account of defence, financial andmanpower considerations.DEFENCE SALESJ7^.   The Government encourages the sale of defence equipmentoverseas where this is compatible with the United Kingdom&apos;spolitical, strategic, security and economic interests. Thereare substantial benefits to be derived from defence sales.They help maintain a viable defence industry and a sound  technological base; they facilitate longer production runs,economies of scale and reductions in the unit cost of equipmentCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfor our own forces; they sustain some .75,000 direct jobopportunities in British industry; they help improve thebalance of payments; and they support political and defencerelations with customer countries.   Other countries, includingthose in the Third World, attach considerable importance tothe freedom to acquire arms to protect their independence andto exercise the right of self-defence embodied in Article 51of the United Nations Charter.   In the absence of agreedmultilateral measures restricting arms transfers, we wouldnot wish to deny to others a right which we claim for ourselve;But our general approach also reflects a policy of responsiblerestraint.   We examine each case on its merits.   There may bemilitary or political difficulties, human rights and armscontrol issues or broader security interests which argueagainst particular sales, and we give such considerations fullweight.750.   Defence sales cover a wide range of applications andassociated services, including airdefence, communications and radar systems, technical assistancand infrastructure projects.   Recent major achievements includsubstantial air defence and communications projects, and thesale of Jaguar, Hawk and Lynx.   Sales of defence equipment/&quot;and associated services_7 are expected to amount to someif       J million in 1980/81.35?CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE GOVERNMENT&apos;S DEFENCE INDUSTRIESRoyal Ordnance Factories751. The Royal Ordnance Factories (ROFs) constitute a largemanufacturing enterprise operating under a Trading Fund. Theysupply a large proportion of the equipment needed by our ArmedForces, producing ammunition, armoured vehicles, guns, smallarms and engineer equipment.   Over half of the ROF outputby value is for export and this excellent performance isexpected to continue.   The ROFs are becoming more involvedin collaborative projects and more effort is being put intodesign and development to complement the productive capacity.752. The ROFs suffered a setback in 1979 with the cancellationof the Iranian order for some 1,200 tanks.   This caused someredundancies at ROF Leeds but the situation has now stabilised.With a recent overseas order for main battle tanks and otherorders in prospect, the future of Leeds is now secure. Thefactory will therefore have the capacity to meet new BritishArmy manufacturing requirements.Royal Dockyards753. The five Royal Dockyards   at Devonport, Portsmouth,Chatham, Rosyth and Gibraltar together constitute the largestjindustrial enterprise within central government.   In them isponcentrated most of the nation&apos;s capacity for repairing andCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALrefitting its warships.   They are thus an important nationalindustry and vital to the nation&apos;s defence.754-    During the past year there has been continuing andwidespread dissatisfaction among the workforce over pay,leading to severe industrial disputes, loss of labour asworkers seek more highly-paid employment elsewhere, conse-quential imbalances in the mix of skills available, risingoverheads and a serious loss of output.   An increasingproportion of the workload is being put out to contract withcommercial yards, both those of British Shipbuilders and thosein the private sector.   But the ability of these yards tohandle the specialised work of refitting warships (as distinctfrom building warships or building and repairing merchantships) is limited.   It has consequently been necessary toconsider how best to reduce the Royal Navy&apos;s demands for therepair and refitting of its warships so -as to bring thesedemands into better balance with the available capacity.755    The Government has therefore set in hand a study of therole, organisation and structure of the Royal Dockyards in theUnited Kingdom - to consider how best they might be organisedto meet the requirements of the Royal Navy in the 1980s and1990s.   The final report of the study is to be submitted by 1April this year.4tfCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL8THE DEFENCE BUDGET801    The Defence Budget Estimates for 1980/81 totalJ million, equivalent to the planning total of 8,065 million at 1979 Survey prices.   This represents anincrease of 396 in real terms compared with expected outturnfor 1979/80.   The Government is currently considering thelevels of defence budget provision for 1981/82 and the twofollowing years.802.   Figure 2-&lt;?  ,* breaks down the Estimates total by majorcategories of expenditure.   Figure  Zl     analyses defenceresources (expenditure, Service and Civilian manpower) bymajor programmes.    (A more detailed analysis and other tablesrelated to the defence budget are given in Volume II of thisstatement).   Figure  2-Z.    compares the defence spending ofmost NATO countries in 1979 in terms of total expenditure,expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP)and per capita expenditure.|803.  Soon after taking office we declared our support forthe NATO aim of annual increases in defence spending in theregion of 3% in real terms up to 1986. This declaration was notade lightly.   Taken together with our economic strategy of1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALreducing      public expenditure for the time being, itlogically entails a switch of resources from civil programmesto defence.   This involves difficult choices in relation notonly to the civil programmes themselves but also to our widerobjectives of securing a better balance between public andprivate spending and investment.   We look forward to the daywhen economic growth   together with genuine detente makepossible a reduction in the defence share of our nationalwealth.   But that time is not yet.   The military dangersfacing the Alliance that have been described in this statementare such that we must make adequate provision for deterrenceand defence, even in these difficult economic times.804.   The starting point for our defence budget decisions isthe military contribution which we believe it right for thiscountry to make.   Of necessity this is based on continuity aswell as innovation.   The gestation period for a major weaponssystem far exceeds the life of a Parliament.   The requirementfor the Tornado aircraft was approved by Ministers in thelate 1960s; the first squadron is expected to enter operationservice in the early 1980s.   The Services&apos; manpower commit-ments are similarly long-term; the career engagement offeredto a Serviceman is for 22 years (though the initial commitmenljon his side is of course a great deal less), and for a careerofficer is 16 or even 37 years.   It follows that a highproportion of the annual defence budgets for the remainder of2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe present Parliament will be devoted to paying for commit-nents entered into by previous administrations.305.   Figure &quot;2-3    illustrates this in respect of that partif the equipment procurement programme (some 60%) which isievoted to major projects.   It shows how typically in &quot;Year 1nthe /ear immediately ahead, over 90% represents expenditurem projects to which the Department is effectively committedy past decisions to enter full development or embark onroduction to meet the requirements of the Services. Thisroportion decreases as one looks further ahead, and by Year 7or example - is of the order of 60%.   The deployment of thealance of 40J6 at that point   can thus be&apos;nfluenced by decisions that are yet to be taken on bringingew projects firmly into the procurement programme.   It isossible to increase the relatively low proportion of spending&apos;n the earlier years which is amenable to new decisions, butnly at the cost of changes in existing full development androduction programmes.   The lesson this teaches is that defencbannot be turned on and off like a tap; reasonable continuity)f policy and funding is essential.   We recognise the militaryralue of many projects begun or continued by our predecessors,pd an important part of our task will be to bring them to[ruition as quickly as possible.I06.  The defence programme cannot be insulated from all hange, but our aim is to restore its momentum and expand it3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALin the ways we have described.   This will mean increaseddefence spending.   But we shall not feel obliged to adhereslavishly to a particular growth path, nor shall we considerit a failure of policy if we modify our spending plans ineither direction from year to year as new information becomesavailable.   If we can achieve our objectives more cheaply,that is to the good, and we shall bring a vigorous managementapproach to bear to secure economies in areas of spendingwhich do not lie at the heart of the programme.Foreign Exchange Costs of Defence807.   As Table  ~ J of Volume II of this statement shows,net invisible expenditure overseas on defence account isexpected to amount to  ~L    J million next year.   As always,by far the largest single item is local defence expenditurein the Federal Republic of Germany - in effect, the statjoningjcosts of the British Forces &apos;in Germany (BFG) - amounting to/~     J million in sterling terms, though by definition itis spent in Deutschemark (DM).   This consists of the DM elemenlof pay and allowances for British Service and Civilian persoim|stationed there, the pay of locally engaged civilians, works,hirings and land costs incurred locally and various other-charges incurred in DM, offset by local receipts mainly forNAAFI trading. Wy-4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL808. The  &quot;l    J million total needs to be seen inperspective.   It represents the initial impact on the balanceof payments and therefore ignores such offsetting factors asthe imports to Britain which would occur if the forces were[in the United Kingdom, and the exports which do occur becausethey are in the Federal Republic.   Nevertheless the risingtrend of the stationing costs of BFG is disturbing.   Over thelast 20 years they have increased by       a year on averagein real terms, that is over and above the rise in defenceprices generally.   By the same token the extra cost of BFGto the defence budget has risen sharply in real terms.809. From 1980/81 the United Kingdom must meet these costsunaided, since the Anglo-German offset agreement of 1977(Cmnd 6970) expires this year.   The absence of offset paymentsin future and the rising cost of BFG will limit our ability toimprove the fighting effectiveness of BAQR and RAF Germany ase would like..  We shall however take what steps we can toreduce our stationing costs in Germany by administrative meansconsistent with military efficiency.&quot;he Search for Savings10.  The Government is committed to making the best possiblese of the taxpayer&apos;s money.   The Ministry of Defence, as aajor spending department, must play a full part in the pursuitf efficiency and savings.   In any large organisation there is5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALalways room for streamlining and there has to be a constantprogramme of evaluation to identify savings and to divertthem to other areas where they can be put to better use.- Theresources available for defence are limited and we cannotafford to waste them.   At the same time the Ministry willconsult its employees about changes which involve loss of jobsand will implement them in a way which will cause the minimumdisruption.811.   The way in which the programme of review is expected tocontribute to savings in civilian numbers is described inChapter 6 (paragraphs 63^-5).        The main studies are:a.     Contract Cleaning and Catering.   This studywas set up to examine whether money and manpowercould be saved by putting more of the work ofcleaning and catering in Ministry of Defenceestablishments out to contract.   Following aninitial study completed last October, detailedwork is now being done at local level directedtowards adopting contract cleaning wherever itmakes sense to do so.   This work is being concen-trated in the first instance on the 80 units orestablishments which employ the most cleaners.The financial case for adopting contract catering I-is less compelling but a number of areas are beingexamined to see whether there is scope for changingthe present arrangements.6CONFIDENTIAL

The Ministry maintainsits own quality assurance staff.   This study (nowcompleted) considered whether it would be possibleto transfer more of this work from the Ministry toindustry, while maintaining essential safetystandards.   It was found possible to recommendmeasures placing still more reliance on contractorsand these will result in worthwhile staff savings.d. Research and Development Establishments. Thisstudy is covered in paragraph 74 .e. Royal Dockyards. . This study is covered inparagraph 755.f. Supply Management.   The Ministry maintainsits own organisations to deal with the holding,issuing and transport of food, clothing, accommoda-tion stores, petrol and oil, non-warlike vehiclesand their spares for the Armed Forces. Thisstudy is looking at the cost effectiveness andsecurity and operational implications of extendingthe use of outside organisations for this work.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL812. The Department is also conducting studies under the direcof Sir Derek Rayner^who has been appointed by the Prime Ministe:to advise on improving efficiency and cutting out waste incentral Government.   The first of these studies (into thearrangements for supplying food to the Armed Forces) isbeing used as a model for four further studiesduring 1980 in which one member of the Department will studya selected area for 90 days to see whether there are admini-strative or other weaknesses calling for deeper scrutiny.The areas selected for study in 1980 are childrens&apos; secondaryeducation overseas, inspection and audit, the claims commissionand assisted travel schemes.813. Immediately on taking office   the Government reviewedthe previous administration&apos;s programme of Civil Servicedispersal.   The inclusion in the programme of posts from suchplaces as Harrogate, Didcot and Bath was. not justified, andthe total cost was excessive.   Following our pledge to cutthe Civil Service and reduce public expenditure   we decided toreduce the programme significantly.   In the Ministry of Defenceplans to disperse 4,250 posts to Cardiff were cancelled. Thenumber of London posts scheduled to be dispersed to Glasgowwas increased to 1,400, and this move to purpose-builtaccommodation in central Glasgow will be completed by themid-1980s.   Plans to disperse Ministry of Defence posts fromthe provinces to Glasgow were cancelled.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL814.   The Ministry is contributing to the Government&apos;s aimto reduce the public sector&apos;s consumption of oil by 5%.However, savings must not prejudice essential operations andtraining.   We are also exploring ways of pruning further thedefence estate.c 15.   The NATO Long-Term Defence Programme (LTDP) has emphasisedthe importance of greater efficiency in the equipment andlogistics areas.   Efforts are being made to improve holdingsof materiel required for logistic support and thus enhance theAlliance&apos;s staying power in war.816. Each Service remains responsible for its own supportorganisation.   This is the,most efficient way to meet opera-tional needs.   Nevertheless, strenuous efforts have been madeto identify areas where logistic support can be more closelyco-ordinated; much has been achieved and large savings made.The search for further savings continues although theopportunities are fewer.817. There is clearly scope   however   for co-operation betweenNATO countries in the fields of equipment and logistics.Equipment collaboration (see Chapter 7) can offer savings inresearch, development and production costs, and can alsocontribute to co-operation in follow-on support and in training.More generally, the LTDP has led to a reappraisal of logisticsupport arrangements.   Responsibility for such support rests9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALprimarily with each nation, acting in conjunction with thosenations in whose territories the forces will be moving andoperating.   Greater attention is now being given to theco-ordination of logistic plans.   We are examining withinNATO the degree of emergency logistic support which could beprovided from the resources of one nation for the forces ofanother.   Some progress has been made, but much more remainsto be done.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn Conclusion1,    This Statement on the Defence Estimates is the Government&apos;sfirst since taking office.   In it we have attempted to presentfully and clearly the facts and major issues on defence as weperceive them.   We hope this presentation will provide a oasisfor the informed public debate about defence which we believenscessary to the success of our defence policy.   The defenceeffort requires not only financial and practical support butalso the full understanding of the community which it serves.2.11 We have described in this statement the potential threatsto the security of the United Kingdom which our defence policyis designed to avert.   Events in Afghanistan warn us that thesethreats are real, not imaginary.   The decade ahead will be atesting one for the Western democracies in many ways and wemust lay stable foundations for the defence of the nationthrough those years.   On all these grounds-, we believe thatthe case for the priority we have proposed giving to defencehas been demonstrated.CONFIDENTIAL

INTRODUCTIONction 1 The Armed Forcesrmation of the Armed Forces (Table 1.1). This table shows the number ofits which comprise the &quot; teeth &quot; elements of the Armed Forces and excludesporting units. The number of personnel and the amount of equipment in eachsel, regiment, battalion and squadron vary according to the role currentlyigned.nctional analysis of Service personnel (Table 1.2). The average strengthsvided for in the annual Estimates are analysed by the function performed.tion 2 Finance and tradetables in this section are particularly relevant to Chapter 8 of Volume I.p meanings of certain financial terms are given in the glossary on page 15 below.ncipal headings of Defence budget (Table 2.1). The expenditure on personnel,ice and civilian, on equipment, by system, and on works, buildings andcellaneous stores are shown for the outturn of earlier years and the estimatedvision for the current and forthcoming years.ence budget and related expenditure (Table 2.3). The amounts in the Defence&apos;get, consisting of the sums for which the Secretary of State for Defence isbonsible together with those spent by the Department of the Environment onbehalf, have to be modified to arrive at the NATO and National Accountsnitions of Defence expenditure. The additional items include commonporting services from other departments listed under the titles of table 2 of theply Estimates, Class I.ctional analysis of the Defence budget (Table 2.4). Data on the estimated cost(the main Defence functions financed from the Defence budget are shownjirely in terms of Estimates.ustrial analysis of Defence expenditure (Table 2.5). Taking account of themodity groups involved this table gives an estimated analysis of most of thect Defence expenditure with UK industry. The expenditure covered broadlyesponds to the defence budget less the pay element, general administrativeenses and some local payments. Each individual contract let is allocated toarticular industry, as defined in the Standard Industrial Classification (1968),rding to the nature of the goods or services to be supplied. All paymentsnst that contract are then recorded to that industry irrespective of the actualstry to which the establishment supplying the goods may be classified in otherial statistics.jence balance of payments: invisible transactions (Table 2.6). This table showsI identifiable incidence on the balance of payments of our forces stationed seas, of our contributions to international defence organisations and of other^tary services. It also shows receipts, including payments by the USeminent to the UK Government in respect of forces stationed in the UK.i figures for &quot; local defence expenditure &quot; represent the drawings of foreign,ange necessary to support our forces overseas. They take no account ofIting factors, including the reduction in imports to the UK and the generationExports from the UK which result from the stationing of forces overseas.are given for the outturn in earlier years and the estimated provision forjicoming year.7
r transactions affecting the balance of payments include Governmenthases and sales of military equipment. Forecasts of these transactions aree, but they are unadjusted and cannot be used to estimate their incidence onalance of payments, as follows:  million1979-80 1980-81Military equipment purchases ...... (326) xxxMilitary equipment sales ......... (319) xxxddition estimates are made of non-governmental transactions related tonee. Official payments by the US Forces in the United Kingdom to UK firmsagencies other than central government plus private expenditure by USonnel are expected to amount to about  190 million in 1980 81.arts and imports of Defence equipment (Tables 2.7 and 2.8). Some exportsimports of Defence equipment can be identified through the Customs andse Tariff. In addition to the equipment categories analysed in the tables theresubstantial sales abroad of other military equipment items, including aeroes, spares for aircraft and engines and some electronic devices, which cannotistinguished from similar goods for civil purposes in the available Customsids. Within this aerospace group the military element is believed to havejunted for  415m in 1977, excluding the export of aircraft parts in connectioncollaborative projects. Recent revisions to the Tariff enable some militarymunications and radar equipment to be identified and data are given forfor 1978.  The destination and origin of this identified external trade isin broad regional groupings also.on 3 Equipmenttables in this section are particularly relevant to Chapter 7 of Volume I.&quot;pment procurement expenditure (Table 3.1). This table summarises the costs quipment procurement. Procurement includes the costs of material andrs purchased but excludes the intra-mural costs of maintenance, which cannotly be identified. The first part of the table separates the costs of the equipmentiramme from the associated costs of managing this programme which coverof MOD personnel and other administrative costs. The second part of thef subdivides the same total cost into Research and Development anduction expenditure.jarch and Development (Tables 3.2 and 3.3). Defence Research and Develop-is carried out both in MOD R&amp;D establishments and extramurally by^try and universities.  Civil aerospace programmes and other civil researchare also undertaken and managed by the Ministry of Defence under agencygements.   Table 3.2 gives details of the gross Defence expenditure onjarch and Development i.e. total money disbursed by MOD before offsettingts and the way in which it was spent.   It differs from the similar datajefence expenditure given in table 4 of Research and development: expendituremployment, published periodically by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) inStudies in official statistics series in that it includes payments to Civil VotesAntral Government funds as part of gross Defence expenditure. Non-defenceB carried out by MOD on repayment terms on behalf of private industry is ded. Table 3.3 gives details of the net cost of defence R&amp;D to public funds,joss expenditure less receipts which are mainly for work done on a repaymentJ. The analysis is similar to that for the Estimates of Defence R&amp;D given inB 7 of the Memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, which coversptimates.8
oduction expenditure (Table 3.4). The main items of equipment productionpenditure are presented in a form similar to that used in the Appropriationccounts and Supply Estimates.er Majesty&apos;s Dockyards (Table 3.5). Production cost figures are shown fore Home dockyards (Chatham, Devonport, Portsmouth and Rosyth) andibraltar combined employing an analysis similar to that used in Statement 3 ofe Dockyard Production A ccounts. Figures are also given for the numbers ofjSsels refitted and the average numbers of employees.yal Ordnance Factories (Table 3.6). The Royal Ordnance Factories&apos; task ismeet the munitions requirements of the Services and undertake approvedrk of a defence nature for Commonwealth and other friendly Governments,mmercial work is undertaken to assist in maintaining essential defence capacity,om 1 July 1974, the operation of the ROFs has been financed by means of aading Fund though the organisation remains under the control of the SecretaryState for Defence and its employees are Civil Servants.tion 4 Service personnele tables in this section are particularly relevant to Chapter 6 of Volume I.e tables show the numbers of personnel of the Regular Forces and of theserves and Auxiliary Forces. The Regular Forces consist entirely of volunteers,th male and female, who are serving on a whole-time basis. They comprise bothService personnel and locally entered personnel. UK Service personnel aremally recruited in the United Kingdom for service world wide. Locallyered personnel are recruited outside the United Kingdom to serve in specialmations with special conditions of service. In some cases they may also betricted as to the areas in which they are required to serve. Troops of thegade of Gurkhas now form the bulk of locally entered personnel.t Regular Forces are supported by the Reserves and Auxiliary Forces. Theserves comprise both Regular Reserves and Volunteer Reserves. The Regularserves consist of former members of the Regular Forces who have a liabilityservice in the Reserve. The Volunteer Reserves and Auxiliary Forces compriseisonnel in civilian occupations who undertake to give a certain amount of theire to train in support of the Regular Forces. The liability to call out of theerves and Auxiliary Forces varies according to their role.three Services run cadet forces for young people. Additionally, the Combinedet Force, which is maintained in certain schools where education continues to17 or above, may have specific sections for individual Services.jome tables, the figures shown for officers include candidates for commissionedice who are required to complete successfully a period of training before theyappointed to commissions. Some will have entered direct from civil life,others will have been selected from the ranks.| figures shown for females comprise members of the Nursing Services andi Women&apos;s Services. Certain professionally qualified female officers are not&apos;missioned in the Women&apos;s Services but in the branch or corps that isropriate to their qualifications.- These officers, of whom there were 00 atnuary 1980 serving in the medical, dental, veterinary and legal specializations,included in the numbers of male officers.pgths of UK Service personnel (Table 4.1). The numbers of UK Servicepnnel in the Regular Forces include those undergoing initial training.9

The numbers shown for each Serviceude those in the appropriate Service component of the Combined Cadet Force.ruitment of UK Service personnel (Table 4.6). This table shows the numbersK Service personnel who have joined the Regular Forces from civil life. Aslained above, some of those shown to have entered as officers will not haven commissioned without first successfully completing a period of training.ruitment of UK male officers (Table 4.7). This table shows the numbers ofe officers who entered the Services from civil life in each entry category,cadets are Army officer candidates who undertake a short period of service asiers before appearing before the Army&apos;s officer selection board.

This table shows the numbers oficemen recruited in each of the main categories. ow of UK Service personnel (Table 4.9). The numbers comprise all thoseService personnel who left the Regular forces, whatever the reason. Someonnel have a liability for Reserve service. In order to include all losses toServices, the numbers who died are also included. ow of UK Service personnel Categories of exit (Table 4.10). The Allices totals given in Table 4.9 are sub-divided to show the cause of leaving. Thegory shown as &quot; officers designate &quot; comprises the &quot; pre-cadets &quot; and &quot; officerts&quot; shown in Table 4.7. The numbers shown as &quot; Premature release at ownest&quot;, for both officers and servicemen, relate only to trained personnel. Theices differ from one another in their engagement structures and in theirngements for granting premature release. Consequently, the categories ofincluded in &quot; Premature release at own request&quot; for servicemen are notsame for each Service, but they all represent premature voluntary wastagethe Services.ice pensioners (Table 4.11). This table shows the number of recipients ofice retired pay (officers) and pensions (servicemen) and invaliding andbutable retired pay and pension. The figures for the latest year are furtherysed both by age of recipient and date of commencement of pension.10
Service pay (Table 4.12). The table gives information on the levels of Service payrelating to the dates in question. The Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB)reports annually recommending rates of pay for all Services ranks up to Brigadieror equivalent. The AFPRB recommendations were fully implemented in May 1979taking effect from 1 April 1979. The index numbers of military salary are basedon April 1975 = 100, which was the previous date at which fully up to daterates of pay were implemented. Illustrative annual rates of pay for all ranks up toBrigadier are also shown. Within each rank servicemen are divided for thepurposes of pay into classes, bands and scales according to their employmentclassification, the nature of their specialisation and the period of their commitmentto serve.Section 5 Civilian staffThe tables in this section are particularly relevant to Chapter 6 of Volume I.The responsibihties of the Ministry of Defence have not remained constant overthe period of the tables and consequently there have been a number of transfersof staff between the Ministry of Defence and other bodies and Departments.The tables show only the staff within the Ministry of Defence as constituted ateach date shown and the figures for successive years are therefore not alwayscomparable. In these tables part time staff are counted as half. In some casesthe figures shown do not add precisely to the totals shown because of rounding.Strengths of staff employed in the Ministry of Defence (Table 5.1). The numbersshown in this table exclude staff at the Royal Ordnance Factories whose costsare borne on a Trading Fund. UK-based civilian staff are those recruited inThe UK even though in some cases they may be serving overseas. Locally engagedstaff are those recruited overseas.Functional analysis of civilian staff (Table 5.2). All MOD civilian staff (UK-basedand locally engaged, industrial and non-industrial), except those at the RoyalOrdnance Factories, are included in this table in terms of average annualEstimates provision.Deployment of UK-based civilian staff (Table 5.3). Both industrial and non-industrial staff, except those at the Royal Ordnance Factories, are included in thistable which gives the actual numbers in each of the organisations making upthe Ministry of Defence.Strengths in Standard regions (Table 5.4). All staff in the UK, except those atthe Royal Ordnance Factories, are included.Strengths of staff employed overseas (Table 5.5). Staff shown as employed inthe Federal Republic of Germany include those in support of The British Armyof the Rhine (BAOR) and Royal Air Force Germany (RAFG) in contiguouscountries e.g. Belgium.Strengths of occupational groups or classes of non-industrial staff (Table 5.6).This table covers all UK-based non-industrial staff including those at the RoyalOrdnance Factories.Recruitment and losses of occupational groups or classes of non-industrial staff(Table 5.7). In this table the numbers shown for recruitment are those enteringthe MOD from outside the UK Civil Service, and for losses those leaving theMOD and the UK Civil Service. The net gains or losses for individual groupsin this table do not explain entirely the year to year changes in the correspondinggroup strength shown in table 5.6 as transfers between groups, transfers fromindustrial grades and transfers to and from other government departments areexcluded from this table.Civilian apprentices (Tables 5.8 and 5.9) The figures shown comprise both craftand technician apprentices.II
Section 6 Health, education and accommodation of the ServicesHealth (Tables 6.1 and 6.2). The Services operate a number of hospitals in thiscountry and in areas abroad where there is a significant British military presence.These hospitals take as patients members of all three Services and theirdependants. In addition the hospitals in the United Kingdom take other civilianpatients under arrangements agreed with the National Health Service. Medicalsupport is also supplied by Service medical staff at individual units, ships andstations.Sickness (Table 6.3). The number of cases of sickness and injury affecting UKService personnel for all Services combined is given in this table according toprincipal diagnosis or cause of injury. It should be noted that, whereas the RoyalNavy and Royal Air Force content is for all cases of off-duty sickness lasting 2days or more terminating in the year, that for the Army covers only those casesadmitted to hospitals or medical units. Sickness at Army unit level, at home oron leave, is not included.Deaths (Table 6.4). This table presents information on the deaths of all RegularUK Service personnel on and off duty. There is sometimes a delay in thestatistical reporting of deaths, especially those occurring overseas, and the latestfigures are liable to be altered slightly. The classifications of deaths in recent yearsis also subject to revision as a result of, for example, a delayed inquest verdict.Military aircraft accidents (Table 6.S). The total number of accidents involvingService aircraft, and the accident rates per 10,000 flying hours, where the accidentresulted in loss of, or serious damage to, the aircraft involved. Figures are alsogiven for the number of casualties, both killed and seriously injured. Informationrelating to aircraft accidents of the three Services in 1979 is given in Annex D ofVolume I.Service married accommodation (Table 6.6). Accommodation is provided forService families in the United Kingdom and abroad, partly by building to approvedstandards and partly by renting accommodation. The Multiple Hirings in BritishArmy of the Rhine (BAOR) and Royal Air Force Germany (RAFG) relate toaccommodation built by private developers and leased by the Federal GermanAuthorities on behalf of the British Forces. Small numbers of Multiple Hiringsare held elsewhere and are included in the &quot; hirings &quot; figures. Service marriedquarters are available to Ministry of Defence civilians serving abroad.House ownership by Service personnel (Table 6.7). The figures on house owner-ship by married male personnel in this table derive from the results of the ArmedForces Accommodation and Family Education surveys. The 1978 survey, forwhich the report is not yet published, covered accommodation only. Theinformation for these surveys is collected by means of questionaires posted to arandom sample of personnel, stratified by rank, from all three Services. The sizeof the sample has been between 11,000 and 14,000.Service Children&apos;s Education Authority schools (Table 6.8). The ServiceChildren&apos;s Education Authority (SCEA) administer primary and secondary schoolsin overseas Military commands for the children of serving pefsonnel. Enrolmentin SCEA schools also includes children of MOD and other UK Civil Serviceemployees serving overseas. The total number of Service children attendingschools of all kinds, based on replies to sample surveys, was estimated to be173,800 in 1977.&quot;Social&quot; expenditure included in the Defence budget (Table 6.9). Services areprovided for members of the Armed Forces and their families i.e. education,married accommodation, medical services. UK-based civilians serving overseas also
enefit from these services. The figures shown in this table for education give theestimated cost of the Service Children&apos;s Education Authority schools and excludeontributions towards the cost of educating Service children in other schools. Thecosts of married accommodation and medical services are net of rents payable forquarters and repayments for civilian patients not entitled to treatment in Servicehospitals respectively. The cost of Service pensions paid out, which do not relateo the current Defence effort, is also shown. Civil superannuation, not coveredby the Defence budget, is not included in this table.Land (Tables 6.10 and 6.11). All land and foreshore held by the Ministry ofDefence is included. Nearly half the total of land owned or leased by the Ministryjof Defence is used for grazing and other agricultural purposes.Section 7 Defence services, and the civilian communityThe tables in this section are particularly relevant to Chapter 5 of Volume I.There are three kinds of Service activity in relation to civilians viz:a. in support of the civil power, where the forces are employed in a fightingcapacity;b. in support of other departments (e.g. the Home Office in connection withfire-fighting);c. in support of the Civil community (e.g. search and rescue operations).Armed Forces and security in Northern Ireland (Table 7.1). Annual figures ofthe Regular Forces in Northern Ireland are given in terms of major units of thecombat arms, e.g. battalion or regiment, the size of which may vary according tothe primary role. This includes Royal Marine commandos in the infantry role.Figures are also given of the number of deaths of members of the Regular Forcesand Ulster Defence Regiment resulting from violence attributable to terroristactivity in the province.Search and rescue (Table 7.2). This table covers incidents in which RescueCo-ordinating Centres (RCCs) in the UK co-ordinated search and rescue (SAR)action in which elements of the Armed Forces were involved. The table alsoincludes urgent medical incidents in which the Forces SAR facilities gaveassistance (e.g. inter hospital transfers). In addition to SAR action co-ordinatedby RCCs, all units of the Armed Forces provide assistance in appropriatecircumstances as do the civilian rescue services and individuals. Central recordsof such occasional ad hoc assistance are not kept and consequently the details arenot reflected in this table.Expenditure on offshore tasks (Table 7.4). The cost of the Royal Navy and RoyalAir Force units engaged in offshore tasks on a regular basis falls on the Defencebudget. Some of the costs shown are recoverable from other GovernmentDepartments.shery protection (Table 7.S). The data in this table relates to activities by theRoyal Navy Fishery Protection Squadron carried out on behalf of and financedy the Fishery departments. Routine boardings of vessels to ensure compliancekith United Kingdom fishery protection legislation are included.Qualifications (Table 7.6). As a result of training and assistance given by theServices to their personnel, formal qualifications are often obtained. Those givenin this table are illustrative of the wider range involved.13
niversity Cadetships are awarded to undergraduates before or during their degreeourses. Medical Cadetships are usually awarded only in the final years ofraining. Service personnel are also sponsored at universities and a number of&quot;egree courses are run at the Service educational establishments, at Royal Navalngineering College Manadon and Royal Military College of Science Shrivenham.n Service units and ships, education officers organise instruction for a range ofeneral Certificate of Education and other academic examinations. In addition,ervice personnel may attend Local Education Authority and other externalourses and will normally be eligible for financial assistance, but these instancesre not recorded centrally and are excluded from this table.uch of the training given to Service personnel results in the acquisition of skillsaluable in later civilian life and in some cases formal qualifications are obtainedf which Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) licences are one example. The tableecords passes of tests for all classes of heavy goods vehicles.utflow of trained Service personnel; skill or trade (Table 7.7). This table showshe numbers of personnel leaving the Services who possessed certain skillsseful to the civil community. Only personnel in readily identifiable groups ofeasonable size have been included. Personnel are classified according to theirrimary employment in the Services at the time of leaving, in the case of Armyfficers by the function of their Arm or Corps. Each group covers the full rangef skills from the professionally qualified to the semi-skilled. Some of those leavingo not follow in civil life the trade or occupation that they practised in theervices. Some acquire through the Further Education Schemes various newunifications not directly connected with their Service trade or occupation butseful for their resettlement, whilst a large number take advantage of the facilitiesvailable for pre-release resettlement training, to learn new skills, renew formerkills or convert their Service skills for the civilian environment.ydrographic services (Table 7.8). The Hydrographer of the Navy is the nationaluthority responsible for hydrographic and oceanographic surveys and nauticalharting. The vessels of the British Survey Fleet are manned by the Royal Navynd they are deployed for the most part in United Kingdom and North Atlanticaters. The Admiralty chart series comprises some 3,400 basic charts and 600atticed versions covering nearly the whole world. They are constantly updatedy weekly Notices to Mariners. Although a few other countries also provideharts in their national series, none provides the comprehensive coverage of theritish Admiralty series which meets about 60% of the world requirements.eteorological Office (Tables 7.9 and 7.10). The Meteorological Office is the Stateeteorological Service and forms part of the Air Force Department of the Ministryf Defence. It is responsible for the provision of meteorological services to theoyal Air Force and the Army, the organisation of meteorological observationsnd for research in meteorology and geophysics. Work is also undertaken forther Government departments.ome free services are provided to the general public through the press and otheredia. More specialised services are provided on a repayment basis, principallyor Civil aviation and industry.xcept for the common services provided by other Government departments asart of their normal functions, i.e. accommodation, stationery and office machinery,he cost of the Meteorological Office is borne by the Defence budget. Outturnata on Meteorological Office expenditure has to be partially estimated since somef it is not distinguishable from other similar Defence expenditure.14
GLOSSARYAppropriation Accounts are prepared after the end of the financial year andrecord the actual payments and receipts.Appropriations-in-aid are receipts used to offset expenditure. They generallyarise from the provision of repayment services, the sale of surplus goods or ofequipment purchased on behalf of the Defence Sales organisation.defence Budget consists of all the expenditure for which the Secretary of Statefor Defence is responsible. It comprises the net total of voted expenditure by theMinistry of Defence and by the Property Services Agency on behalf of theMinistry of Defence.defence Programme comprises the Defence budget (q.v.) plus net Governmentlending to the Royal Ordnance Factories from the National Loans Fund.Estimates, Supply Estimates are prepared before the beginning of the financialyear and give the proposed expenditure. These are then voted by Parliament.Estimates prices are the prices used in the Estimates presented to Parliament.Prior to 1979-80 these were the prices ruling in the autumn preceding thefinancial year in question. From 1979-80 onwards they are forecasts of the pricesexpected to rule when the expenditure occurs and are otherwise referred to asforecast outturn prices.Outturn, forecast outturn describes actual expenditure or estimates of it made onthe basis of incomplete information i.e. before the Appropriation Accounts areprepared.Outturn prices are the prices of the period when the expenditure occurs, alsodescribed as current prices.Public expenditure survey is the annual review of public expenditure plans overa 5-year period undertaken by the Government.Survey prices are the prices used in the Public Expenditure Survey.

As the figures for female officers designate are small, they have been includedin the figures for female officers.The Services differ in their engagement structures and in their arrangements for premature release. Consequently,the categories included in the numbers of servicemen shown as &quot; Premature release at own request &quot; are not the samefor each Service, but they are the categories that represent premature voluntary wastage from each Service.37
