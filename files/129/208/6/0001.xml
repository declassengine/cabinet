CONFIDENTIALDCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S #OVERNMENTII      c(80) 6COPY NO22 January 1980CABINETTHE NOVEMBER 1979 UPRATING OF RETIREMENTPENSIONS AND OTHER LONG-TERM BENEFITSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretary of State for Social Services82BACKGROUND1, Legislation required that the uprating in November 1979 of retirementpension and other long-term benefits (eg invalidity benefit for the long-termsick) should be in line with an estimate of the higher of the rise in earningsor the rise in prices over the 12 months from November 1978. Ourestimate was that prices (17. 5 per cent) would run ahead of earnings. Thefigures now available show that in fact earnings went ahead of prices:19.2 per cent (provisional) compared with 17.4 per cent.2, We in fact increased pensions by 19. 5 per cent, but this included a1.9 per cent increase to fulfil our campaign promise to make good theshortfall in Labour&apos;s 1978 Uprating,    But the Opposition have already saidthat the earnings figure shows a further &quot;shortfall&quot; and are pressing us onour intentions.3, We need to decide what to do, and when to announce our decision,CONSIDERATION4, There is no legal requirement to make good a shortfall due to anunderestimate of prices or earnings movements.    We have no statutory orpolitical commitment to take action.    To make good would cost  165 millionin a full year and add significantly to our problems in bringing publicexpenditure under control.5, Long-term benefits did not lose value as a result of the shortfall sincethe rise in prices over the 12 months to November 1979 was 17,4 per cent.The uprating has therefore met our pledge to price protect pensioners.6, We are removing the link with earnings in the Social Security Billnow before Parliament, as we announced in the Budget last June,7, Our view is that, particularly in view of the public expenditureimplications, we should not make good the 1979 shortfall.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL8. We could defer an announcement until the full details ef this year&apos;suprating are given at the time of the Budget statement.    But the SocialSecurity Bill is now in Committee and the debate on the provisionsrelating to uprating (Clause 1) will lead to pressure to declare our intentions.There is in fact an Opposition amendment which would require shortfalls tobe made good.    In resisting the amendment Department of Health andSocial Security Ministers would make it clear that our pledge to protectthe pension against increases in prices was a minimum commitment andthe Government would retain the discretion to do more when circumstancespermitted.9. We are in favour of an announcement as soon as possible to get thematter out of the way.CONCLUSION10. Colleagues are invited:-a. to agree that w &gt; do not make good the shortfall in theNovember 1979 rates of long-term benefit; andb. to agree that we announce this decision as soon as possible.G HP JTreasury Chambers22 January 19802CONFIDENTIAL
