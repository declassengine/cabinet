CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80)24 COPY NO gg25 April 1980CABINETCIVIL SERVICE NUMBERS AND COSTSMemorandum by the Minister of State, Civil Service DepartmentPOLICY1. The Government&apos;s policy is dear.    It is:a. to reduce the functions of central Government and so to reducethe number of staff required;b. to see that the remaining functions are performed aseconomically and efficiently as possible; andc. as a result, to give the taxpayer value for the money spent onthe Civil Service.FACTS2. First, some relevant figures about the size of the Civil Service:1952 - 762,0001961 - 640, 000 (post-war low)1976 - 746,0001979 - 732,0001980 - 705, 000Annex A spells out the history by Departments and takes account of machineryof government changes.    From 1960 to 1980 there has been a total increase of66, 400 (nearly 10. 5 per cent).    The main changes upwards have been asfollows:1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALDepartment	staff 1960	in post 1980	Increase between 1960 and 1980	Department of Health and Social Security-	51, 000	95, 000	43,000	84%Department of Employment	22,100	51, 400	29,300	133%Inland Revenue	55,600	79,000	23,400	42%Department of the Environment/ Property Services Agency/Transport	34,200	62,800	28,600	84%Home Office	15,200	33,700	18,500	122%Customs and Excise	15,300	27,400	12,100	79%During the same period there has of course been a great increase in the work(see Notes to Annex A).    The largest decrease has been in Ministry ofDefence/Royal Ordnance Factories which have come down from 322, 000 to241, 700, a reduction of 80,300 or 25 per cent (though over the same periodthe Armed Forces have reduced from 526, 000 to 312, 000, a fall of 40 percent).COSTS3. The revised Estimates provision for Civil Service pay costs in 1979-80was about  3, 700 million.    In 1980-81 the provision will be about 4, 600 million after allowing for the cost of this year&apos;s pay settlements.The full annual cost of employing an Assistant Secretary at 1 January 1980 is 24, 600.    Costs by grade are set out more fully in Annex B.ACHIEVEMENT SO FAR4. Our decisions to date have brought us down from 732, 000 to 705, 000.The April 1981 figure will not exceed 695, 000.    It would be a good deal less,but for additions of over 11, 000 mainly to provide additional prison officersand to handle rising unemployment.    New unemployment forecasts and otherunavoidable demands for 1981-82 have led to claims for a further 7, 000 stafffrom that year.    More bids for extra staff must be expected.    But if they arekept to a minimum the reductions still to come from the decisions weannounced last December should reduce staff numbers to not much over670, 000 by the end of this Parliament - a net reduction of over 8 per centfrom when we took office.    All Ministers have worked very hard to achievethis result..   It will be much the largest reduction since the 1950s.    But is itenough ?2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. I do not think that 8 per cent will satisfy my colleagues, our supportersor the public.    We Lave all made big efforts already     But I believe that wemust do more.    I also believe that more is possible.    During the next threeyears, wastage from the Civil Service (see Annex C) will be around 240, 000.This will help enormously.WHAT SHOULD BE OUR APPROACH?6. We should make a plan now for the rest of this Parliament and stick toit.    We have between three and four years.    A planned approach will do morethan a series of lurches.    We ought to give Departments time to work outsensible changes and implement them in an orderly way.7. We should continue to look for whole functions that can be dropped, ordone more cheaply or efficiently in the private sector.    But I believe that ourmain attack must be on simplifying work and doing it more efficiently, notleast in the demand-led areas which otherwise exert an inexorable upwardpressure on manpower.    More than two-thirds of the Civil Service areemployed in defence, taxation, social security and the prisons. Furthersavings in these and similar areas must mainly be achieved by carrying outessential functions more economically.8. Parliament and the public generally are mainly interested in thenumbers of staff and not in the wider costs of administration.    That isinevitable.    But we must not forget costs or do things which are plainly sillysimply in order to reduce the head-count.    We need a drive on costs as well ason manpower.9. The main drive within each Department must come from theresponsible Minister.    We shall have to get down into the detail and make thenecessary changes.    Sir Derek Rayner has already pointed the way in whichMinisters, no longer simply policy-makers but managers as well, should pulltogether the costs and take stock of the activities of their Departments.Styles will vary, and the great size of some Departments means that theirMinisters will simply have to delegate.    One way or another, however, eachof us will have to tackle the job systematically and spend time on it.Sir Derek Rayner has given us some good ideas to build on.EFFICIENCY - DETAILED PROPOSALS10. We shall need to look at i. the efficiency of the Service as a whole;and ii. the efficiency of specific operations.    I put forward suggestions forparticular studies and exercises, involving close collaboration between theCivil Service Department (CSD) and other Departments, at Annex D. Inaddition, the CSD should discuss with each Minister and his officials specificways of simplifying and streamlining the main manpower-intensive activitiesof his Department.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL11. I believe that we must make a particular effort to reduce senior grades.These have not yet started to come down in step with the rest - a reduction ofno more than 12 (1. 5 per cent) - over the last 12 months.    They must do so ifour policy is to look credible both inside the Service and more widely.    In mylimited experience, I have noticed examples of work which in our last period ofoffice would be done by, say, an Assistant Secretary but which are now done atleast a grade higher,    I propose that each Department should reduce its postsat Under Secretary and above, taking the number on 1 April 1979 as the base-line, by at least 10 per cent by 1 April 1982.    Retirements from these gradesshould run at about 8 per cent a year over the next three years, so this shouldnot be too difficult.CHANGING THE CONVENTIONS OF GOVERNMENT12. We must encourage the Civil Service to think in a different way, to seeit as a main aim to use small resources to the best advantage.    I will reportbefore the Summer Recess on pay, promotion and retirement policies andother relevant matters.    I will also report later on the use of the gradingstructure - see Annex E.SETTING A TARGET13. When we embarked on the Lord President of the Council&apos;s exercise werightly decided not to set a target.    How could we know in advance whatfunctions could be dropped?    The outcome showed wide differences betweenDepartments.    But a further programme aimed mainly at improvingefficiency is another matter.    I believe that we must have something to aim atand that we should try to improve the efficiency of all the work that is beingdone.    We should now set ourselves a common target.    Then we must use thevarious measures set out in this paper to help us achieve it.14. I propose that we should aim at a Civil Service which is smaller by theend of this Parliament than it has been since the war - a target figure of630, 000.    This means a reduction of around 10 per cent from the presentlevel, and of more than 100, 000 since we came into office.15. At first sight this may look like a tall order and it is not made easierby offsetting growth.    But the decisions we have already taken put us on coursefor a total not much above 670, 000 (see paragraph 4) and there is more tocome from the further options and studies we have already decided to pursue.16. We must make some allowance for factors outside the Government&apos;scontrol such as unavoidable growth.    Circumstances are bound to change andcomplete stability is a pipedream.    I suggest therefore that we should aim toprovide a small contingency margin of about 10, 000.    The CSD wouldadminister the use of this margin, giving priority to those claims which wereforced upon us by rising unemployment or any other external factors. If,conversely, some of these changes led to possible reductions in staff thecontingency margin would be increased.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL17. This means a cut of some 12 per cent on the present level of 705, 000.All this can be achieved if each Minister will adopt ar the target for theDepartments under his control, in addition to the savings already firmlyagreed, a progressive reduction in staff of at least Zj per cent in each of theyears 1981-82, 1982-83 and 1983-84.    That is what I prcpose.    Each Ministershould draw up with the CSD a plan for action in his own Department. Surelyit is not impossible to find further reductions of this order in any Departmentthrough increased efficiency, simplification and other reductions in work,given three years in which to plan and carry it out?    To help towards this aimMinisters would naturally be able to use the savings proposed in Annex 2 ofthe Lord President of the Council&apos;s paper (C(79) 57), as well as savings fromthe further studies, but not those already agreed and announced as firmsavings on 6 December.LONG-TERM ARRANGEMENTS18. We should also make sure that the experience of individualDepartments, and that resulting from Sir Derek Rayner&apos;s work, is effectivelydisseminated.    The CSD should be given the task of working with eachDepartment to ersure that each Minister can have full information about whatis happening in his command (in a lasting form which will survive individualMinisterial moves); and so that we all can know the best practice beingapplied elsewhere.    If the Cabinet agrees, I will take on this task and reportprogress to the Prime Minister and colleagues.PRESENTING THE POLICY19. Leaks and rumours have been rife.   The National Staff Side haveunderstandably demanded to know what is going on.    I consider an earlyannouncement essential.    If these proposals are accepted, I suggest that Ishould announce the decision, and inform the Staff Side, on Tuesday 6 May.Delay will only cause us more trouble and will lower morale further.20. Presentation to the staff will be especially important.    I suggest thatthe main points should be three assurances:a. That, subject always to a crisis which we cannot now forsee,these proposals are our final instalment for the present Parliament.We ought to end uncertainty.b. That we are not seeking compulsory redundancy and will aim tokeep it to the minimum (the existing terms are generous but I have putproposals separately to colleagues on easing the path for voluntaryearly retirement).c. That all Department will consult their Staff Sides to the fullestextent possible about the methods of reaching their target savings.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL21. All Departments should make a special effort to keep their managersinformed of what Is going on so that they can have the opportunity to contribute.They will have to do a great deal of the work, and should be kept fully in touch.22. More generally, we must as far as possible avoid making the CivilService feel that we are getting at them.    There is too much attention to thesize of the Service, its salaries and pensions; too little to its loyalty,integrity and dedication.    We must pay serious regard to morale when weconsider the future of the pay system.    Meanwhile, I would ask colleagues totake every opportunity they can to show that we value the job the Service isdoing for us and the country.23. I invite my colleagues to agree:a. That we should make a plan for the next three years and stick toit, with the main emphasis on simplifying work and making it moreefficient, and with an eye to cost as well as numbers.b. That a programme of work should be undertaken as set out inparagraph 10 and Annex D.c. That we should reduce the numbers of the most senior staff(Under Secretary and above) by 10 per cent by 1 April 1982.d. That we should aim at a Civil Service no larger than 630, 000 bythe end of this Parliament.e. That in order to reach this target, with a margin for contingen-cies and offsetting growth, each Department should aim to save Zj percent in each of the years 1981-82, 1982-83 and 1983-84, iu additionto the savings that have already been agreed.f. That the improvement of Departmental systems should be pursuedas in paragraph 18.g. That I should announce our decision on Tuesday 6 May.h. That assurances should be given to the staff on the lines ofparagraph 20.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL24.       I also invite colleagues to note:a. That I shall submit further papers on pay, promotion andretirement policies and on grading.b. The importance of showing how much we appreciate the goodwork that the Civil Service is doing.P CCivil Service Department24 April 19807CONFIDENTIAL

This led to rapid staff increases between 1975 and1977.    (The Training Services Division of Manpower ServicesCommission achieved 94,200 Training Opportunities Schemecompletions in 1977 as against 15 500 achieved by the Departmof Employment in 1971.)The level of unemployment has increased markedly over the per1960 average: 360,0001979 average: 1,390,000Build up of centralised driver and vehicle licensing.Vehicles with licences current in 1960: 9 44O,O00&quot; I J         1978: 17,817,000Increase in size of Home Office mainly due to increase in priservice, reflecting larger prison population and changing stastandards.Average daily prison population in 1965: 30&gt;421  it I 1979: 42,220(England and Wales only; includes borstals anddetention centres)
Increase in Customs and Excise staff between 1973 and 1977 due tointroduction of VAT and effects of joining EEC.

On current retirement patterns about50,000 of these will retire in the period.     This represents about 9f&lt;&gt;of the present number of non-industrial staff.In some senior grades, retirements will reach a peak during the periodThe following table shows the extent of estimated retirements from theAdministration Group:ESTIMATES (NORMAL AGE) RETIREMENTS 1980-81 to 1982-83Grade	Number	As percentage ofAS	320	25SP	340	45Prin	940	20SEO	1580	20HEO	2840	12EO	4630	7Voluntary ResignationsAbout 48,000 non-industrial staff resigned in both 1978 and 1979.There may be some fall in this number in future years because theslow-down in recruitment will tend to reduce the numbers of youngjunior staff who are normally more likely to resign.     Changes inthe economic climate will also be a factor and the best guess thatcan be made is that voluntary wastage of non-industrial staff willaverage about 40,000 a year, ie a total of 120,000 over the 3 yearperiod.1
Industrial civil servantsThere is no centrally held data about the wastage of industrial ciyilservants but assuming loss rates similar to those for the junior gfachof non industrial civil servants, the estimated loss each year isat about 23,000, a total of about 70,000 over the period.Total lossesIncluding losses from other causes, amounting to about 2,000 a yetestimated losses in each of the years are put at about 80,000 givija total loss of about 240,000 over the 3 year period (some 34$ ofpresent size of the civil service) .
ANNEX Difil-|ad(putPROPOSED PROGRAMME OP WORK(i)   Staff Inspection1.   Staff Inspectors examine whether the work is essential andwhether it is correctly graded and manned.   There is a centralcadre of 40 in the CSD and some 600 in departments.   In recentyears, the direction, methods and standards of staff inspectionhave been much improved.   The implementation of inspectors* recom-mendations in the two years 1977 and 1978 saved 3560 posts( 17- l8m a year).2.   We feel sure, however, that more can be done.   The savingsquoted above represent little over 50$ of the recommendations.While we do not expect 100$, since the Inspectors will not alwaysget it exactly right, a higher rate must be achieved.   A new studyof staff inspection in departments is in hand, and measures forits improvement will shortly be submitted to Ministers.(ii)   Cutting the cost of Service-wide activities3.   We should expand and speed up the work led by CSD in areaswhere central expertise can most fruitfully be brought to bear,and especially improving the efficiency and economy of the sup-porting services common to all departments.   Examples are messen-gerial and typing services, transport, post, telecommunications,reprographics.   Good results have been obtained from past studiesin some of these fields;   a current study of messengers has identi-fied potential savings of between 30$ and 50$ of complement inthe departments looked at so far, which if repeated across alldepartments would produce savings of  7-8m annually.
4. Hitherto, this programme has been undertaken on a small scwith modest resources, and each study has been prolonged whiledepartments have been looked at in sequence.   We believe thatshould be possible to make a larger and faster impact:(a) by increasing the resources devoted to this task so tmore studies can be mounted simultaneously; and(b) beginning with the messengerial study, by preparing gulines on the basis of studies in three or four departmentswhich other departments would then be asked to implement.It should then be possible to complete studies and promulgatestandards in all the supporting services.5. There is also scope for economy in other Service-wide actities. We are already looking at statistics. Training, advertsing and information are possible candidates for later studies(iii) Mechanisation6. There is also scope for the improvement of efficiency by tfurther computerisation of manual functions and, in particulaby the introduction of word processors and other small electromachines.   The attitude of the staff is very important here, srecent publicity about new technology has aroused fears of reddancy.   We hope that current discussions with the unions willproduce a greater spirit of co-operation, but we shall in anycase have to press forward on this front, taking unilateral acwhere it is necessary and right to do so.(iv) Specific questions7. We should certainly continue to build on the results ofSir Derek Rayner*b scrutiny programme and other initiatives by
seeing how its lessons can be applied more widely.   Here too thereis scope for the central role of my department in disseminatingexperience and ensuring a reasonable consistency of approach.Examples are:-(a) Supervision of local government activity.   Some 5000 staffare involved.   We need to generalise the good work alreadystarted in some departments, and I shall be proposing to theMinisters concerned that we should aim at a reduction of one-third across the board.(b) Industrial sponsorship.   I propose that we should followup the Secretary of State for Trade&apos;s recent initiative witha general review, and will put forward specific proposalsshortly.(c) Networks of Regional and Local Offices.   Several usefulstudies have been set in hand.   We should press ahead to con-clusions and consider the scope for further work.
CONFIDENTIALANNEX&apos; ETHE USE OF THE GRADING STRUCTURELApart from the specific reduction in senior grades proposed inpara 11, we must look at the use of the grading structure.Sir Derek Rayner has proposed the reduction of the length of thehierarchy by at least three grades.   His preferred method isto abolish whole grades, eg Second Permanent Secretary, DeputySecretary, Under Secretary, Senior Principal, Senior ExecutiveOfficer.   I am not sure that the abolition of specific gradesis the best answer.   But I will consider it, and report tocolleagues in the later paper I have promised.2. The real problem is the way in which, in any specific case,the grading structure is used.   Too many levels are commonlyinvolved in the handling of a particular job, and work getsbogged down in the hierarchy, wasting both money and time.The answer should be sought by a combination of (i) takinggrading levels out of    particular working structures; and(ii)   channelling the flow of work so that successive levelsare skipped wherever possible, reserving their use for whenit is necessary.3. I propose that, as a first step, CSD should undertake asmall number of initial studies of representative areas of work.The objective would be to draw up criteria and guidelines forthe more economical use of grading levels which can then beapplied generally.   When this had been done, departments wouldbe required to apply these criteria and guidelines, possiblywith CSD help, and to report the outcome with target dates forimplementation.1CONFIDENTIAL
