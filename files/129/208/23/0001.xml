SECRETCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 23COPY NO18 March 1980CABINETEUROPEAN COUNCIL -UNITED KINGDOM BUDGET CONTRIBUTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign andCommonwealth Affairs and the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. Cabinet will need to consider at its meeting on 20 March what thePrime Minister might be authorised to accept at the European Councilmeeting on 31 March/1 April as a reasonable settlement to eur Budgetcontribution problem.STATE OF PLAY2. At Dublin the negotiations were conducted on the basis of an estimatednet contribution by the United Kingdom of 1552 mEUA ( 1.0 billion) in 1980.The Commission are now revising their estimates and the new figure will behigher.    On a realistic estimate of the cost of the 1980 Budget when it isfinally adopted, our net contribution is likely to work out at something nearer1700 mEUA ( 1.1 billion).    We would expect to get a refund of perhaps250 mEUA ( 170 million) under the existing 1975 financial mechanisrr. AtDublin it was agreed that the removal of die limitations to this mechanismcould contribute to the solution of our Budget problem.    This could reduceour net contribution by another 250 mEUA ( 170 million) or so in 1980.It should prove negotiable even though the French are being difficult. Butwe are faced with a net contribution after these adjustments of 1200 mEUA( 0.8 billion).3. The Commission have proposed that the other part of the solution toour problem should be a regulation based on Article 235 of the Treatypermitting supplementary expenditure in the United Kingdom for purposesconsistent with Community policies.    The Commission have made noproposals for the amount that we should get under this mechanism. Informaldiscussions over the last few weeks have given us an idea of the range ofwhat seems likely to be on offer at the European Council.    The lower end isrepresented by a figure mentioned informally (but not we think inadvertently)by a senior French official - namely a total of perhaps 800 mEUA includingthe refund under the financial mechanism - which would leave our netcontribution at some 900 mEUA ( 600 million).    The upper end of the rangeseems to be Roy Jenkins1 figure of a total of 1000 mEUA (again includingthe refund through the financial mechanism) leaving a net contribution ofsome 700 mEUA ( 470 million).1SECRET
SECRET4. Foi our part, we have moved away from our original objective of abroad balance between contributions and receipts and have offered to makea modest net contribution.    The Prime Minister suggested to Signor Cossigain January that our net contribution should be less than that of the nextrichest Member State (namely France); the difference should be at leastproportionate to the difference in levels of Gross National Product per head.Our intention was to reduce our contribution to about 200-250 mEUA. Ifthe prospective contribution for 1980 is 1700 mEUA, the amount we wouldneed to secure would thus be somewhere in the range 1450-1500 mEUA( 970- 1000 million).5. This may piove unattainable and Cabinet should consider whether alower figure would be politically defensible.DURATION AND DYNAMISM6. It seems likely mat the rest Of the Community will agree that thesolution snoula last for 3 or 4 years before it is reviewed; our objectivewill be to get a longer period - eg 6 years.    More important is the problemof dynamism - ie a formula that will ensure that our net contribution doesnot rise again to unacceptable levels after 1980.    We have suggested aformula that would produce mis result - namely agreement that in eachsubsequent year our receipts per head from the Community Budget shouldbear the same relationship to average Community receipts per head as in1980.    But this may not be attainable and we may need to seek anothersolution that will achieve the result defined above.DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN NOW AND THE COUNCIL7. A series of bilateral discussions are in train in order to explore thepossibilities for a settlement acceptable to both France and Germany whichthe Italians as the Presidency could then put forward to the Council. Ourcontacts with the French and Germans reveal that, while they would like tosee the matter settled and are prepared to go above what was on offer inDublin, there is still a wide gap between us on figures and durability. Acrucial preliminary meeting will be that between the Prime Minister andHerr Schmidt on 28 March.RELATED ISSUES8. We have resisted any link between the Budget problem and otherissues before the Community and have argued that each should be dealt withon its merits.    But we are advised that other Member States will not be ableto justify a substantial concession to us unless they are able to take somethinghome themselves.    The French have publicly linked the Budget issue to asatisfactory outcome for mem on Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) prices,sheepmeat, fish and energy.    Our line on these issues should be asfollows:-2SECRET
SECRETi.    Agricultural Prices.    At the next Agriculture Council on26-27 March we should not move from our basic position - namelyno price increases for products in surplus.    There are, of course,sound reasons for doing this apart from the dispute about our Budgetcontribution.    If we found that some concession at the EuiopeanCouncil, could secure a settlement of our Budget issue, we shouldbe ready to make it; but not, of course, at excessive cost to ourconsumers or producers.ii.    Sheepmeat.    If necessary, we should concede some limitedintervention and a Community financial premium to satisfy theFrench, so long as the permanent sheepmeat regime gave theUnited Kingdom a resource benefit.iii. Fish.    Any linkage in this case (beyond a general undertakingto make progress) would be unhelpful to an eventual settlement onthe Common Fisheries Policy and we should seek to avoid it.iv. Energy.    If it would help to secure a settlement, the PrimeMinister could make a statement about our policies which, whileavoiding any substantive concession, would appeal to ourCommunity partners.NEED TO SHOW PROGRESS9.        If we can get a settlement at the next Council, this would be in ourinterests and would clear out of the way a major impediment to otherCommunity business. But this may not prove possible - particularly if thereis no prospect of early agreement on CAP prices.    In the absence of asolution to our Budget problem, our objective must be to secure themaximum possible degree of support in the Council for our essentialrequirements on:-i.    the amount - see paragraph 5 above;ii.    duration - it would be no use having a regulation that lapseda^ter 2 or 3 years;iii. dynamism - we must have a formula that will ensure that ournet contribution does not rise again to unacceptable levels infuture years;iv. budget restructuring - we must have a commitment by theCommunity to reduce the percentage of the Budget going toagriculture.If clear evidence of progress on these points could be reflected in thecommunique, this would help the Prime Minister to defend the outcome ofthe Council on her return home.3SECRET
SECRETRECOMMENDAT IONS10.       We recommend to colleagues that:-i. We press for a solution to our Budget problem at the MarchCouncil on the lines suggested in this paper.ii.    If no solution is attainable, we work to obtain the maximumdegree of support from oUr partners for our four crucialobjectives summarised in paragraph 9, and a communique basedon this which provides definite evidence that clear progresstowards a solution is being made.CG HForeign and Commonwealth Office18 March 19804SECRET
