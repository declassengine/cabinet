CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80)18 COPY NO 8211 March 1980CABINETTHE FINANCIAL TREATMENT OF STRIKERS ANDTHEIR FAMILIESMemorandum by the Secretary of the Cabinet1. The Cabinet considered the problem of supplementary benefit paidto strikers&apos; families at their meeting on 20 December 1979(CC{79 ) 26th Conclusions, Minute 6). They agreed that further considerationshould be given to different possible approaches to the problem,2. An informal group of Ministers under the Prime Minister&apos;schairmanship has now considered the problem in detail.    This paper setsout their conclusions.    For convenience it refers throughout to &quot;strikers&quot;;but in practice the proposals vvould need to apply to all those directlyinvolved in trade disputes, whether on strike, laid off, or locked out.3. When the Cabinet discussed this issue on 20 December there weredoubts whether it would be practicable to differentiate between membersand non-members of trade unions in settling entitlement to SupplementaryBenefit; on the other hand the Cabinet were not at that stage prepared toaccept that non-unionists should be deemed to receive strike pay whichclearly would not be available to them.    The Secretary of State for SocialServices is, however, satisfied that a distinction based on membership ofa trade union is practicable in operating the Supplementary Benefit system,so that the deeming of strike pay to union members alone is possible.That disposes of the practical objection to &quot;deeming&quot; strike pay for unionmembers only.   In its discussion, however, the Ministerial Group thoughtthat the Cabinet should have another opportunity of considering whether itwould be preferable to single out trade union members for specialtreatment, by deeming the payment of strike pay to them, or to approachthe problem by the different route of arguing that the &apos;requirements level&apos;of Supplementary Benefit for all strikers should be reduced withoutspecifically deeming strike pay for the purpose.4. The argument for the &quot;deeming&quot; option, confining the reduction tothe strikers who are members of trade unions, is that the unionist has apotential source of income from his trade union which is not available to the1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnon-unionist, and that to extend the reduction to non-unionists could havethe effect of putting pressure on non-unionists to join a union.    In favourof extending the reduction to all strikers (the &quot;reduced requirements level&quot;option) it can be argued that it is offensive to public opinion for the Stateto subsidise strikers&apos; families whether the striker is a member of a unionor not; that this option avoids the necessity of giving statutory expressionto &quot;deeming&quot; strike pay; that it does not put less pressure on unions topay strike pay; and that it does not give the unions the opportunity ofaccusing the Government of discriminating against unions and their members.5.        Subject to a decision on this issue the Group agreed to recommendthe following package of measures to the Cabinet -a. The penalty (whether deemed strike pay or a reduction inthe requirements level) should be set initially at  12 per week.Technically, to make the deeming option fully effective, deemedstrike pay would need to be made ineligible for the present&apos;miscellaneous income&apos; disregard in calculating SupplementaryBenefit entitlement.b. The penalty should be adjusted automatically at yearlyintervals in line with the general movement in SupplementaryBenefit rates (in order to minimise Parliamentary debate) butsubject to a power to vary the updating up or down by Order whenthis seemed desirable.c. Any strike pay actually received, up to the level of thepenalty, should be left in the striker&apos;s hands and not counted asincome for the purpose of calculating Supplementary Benefit.This is necessary in order to avoid the imposition of a doublepenalty.d. Tax refunds received by strikers should be counted in fullin calculating bis family&apos;s entitlement to Supplementary Benefit(at present, where there is no ether source of &quot;miscellaneousincome&quot; the first  4 of the tax refund is ignored for SupplementaryBenefit purposes).e. Those on whom the penalty is imposed (in the &quot;deeming&quot;option striking trade unionists and in the reduced requirements leveloption all strikers) should be debarred from receiving urgent needspayments for hardship except where it arises from fire, flood, orother comparable emergencies unrelated to the dispute. Specialpayments related to the illness of a dependant (and veryexceptionally of the striker himself) would continue to be made.This provision is necessary to avoid reduced entitlements toSupplementary Benefit being replaced by claims for urgent needs2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpayments and thus nullifying the intention of the new arrangements.The Group recognised that the absence of a formal safety net couldin exceptional circumstances lead to well-publicised cases ofserious hardship.    The Secretary of State for Social Servicesshould therefore have power to make regulations which could beused to mitigate the severity cf the basic proposal ii laterexperience showed this to be necessary.f. Supplementary Benefit paid to strikers should be madetaxable at the same time as Unemployment Benefit and SupplementaryBenefit paid to the unemployed (on present plans in April 1982).6. Mea&amp;ares 5a. -5e. would be introduced in the forthcoming SocialSecurity (No 2) Bill or in regulations made under it, and would come intoeffect at the time of the next supplementary benefit uprating inNov ember 1980.    Measure f. would be introduced in the 1981 Finance ymiand become effective from April 1982.7. The Group recognised that, from April 1982, the change in thetaxation arrangements could lead to a problem of &quot;double payments&quot; tostrikers becc.use the striker&apos;s tax position will then be &quot;frozen&quot; duringthe strike and any refunds paid only after he has returned to work.   If noaction is taken the striker&apos;s supplementary benefit will be increased duringthe strike to compensate for the absence of tax refunds and he will also getthe tax refunds after he returns to work.    This situation arises now when astriker cannot obtain tax refunds to which he is entitled, eg because hisfirm&apos;s pay clerks are al. o on strike.    None of the possible techniques forcoping with this problem is without difficulty and it could simply beignored.    But no final decision is needed at this stage.8. The tax measure at 5f. will need to be announced as part of theBudget.    The Group agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and,theSecretaries of State for Employment and for Social Services should jointlyconsider the timing of the announcement of the other elements in the package.CONCLUSIONS9. The Group invites the Cabinet toi. Decide whether the financial penalty for strikers shouldapply to members of trade unions only, in the form of deemedstrike pay, or to all strikers in the form of a reduced requirementslevel for supplementary benefit.ii. Agree to measures a. -f. in paragraph 5 above, and to theproposals for the necessary legislation in paragraph 6.ROBERT ARMSTRONGCabinet Office11 March 1980CONFIDENTIAL
