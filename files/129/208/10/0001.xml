CONFIDENTIALENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80)105 February 1980COPY NO83CABINETTOP SALARIES REVIEW BODY - REPORT NO. 13: PARLIAMENTARYPAY AND ALLOWANCESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of LancasterINTRODUCTION1. Report No. 13 from the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) onParliamentary Pay and Allowances was delivered to the Prime Minister on15 January.    It recommends an increase in MPs&apos; secretarial allowance andchanges in its method of payment, together with improvements in certainpension arrangements, in severance pay, and in the free travel arrangements.A new support allowance for Ministers in the House of Lords is alsorecommended.    The TSRB also reiterate their earlier view that a salary linkwith an outside analogue for MPs&apos; salary would be undesirable.2. A summary of the Report&apos;s recommendations is at Annex A; the termsof reference for the review are at Annex B.    Most of the Report isuncontroversial but two comments which need particular examination are thoseon the secretarial allowance and the salary link.    I have had preliminarydiscussions with the Executive Committee of the 1922 Committee about thesematters.SECRETARIAL ALLOWANCE3. The TSRB comment on the growing usage of secretarial and researchassistance by MPs, reflecting the growth in paper-werk and the need for themto inform themselves on increasingly technical or specialist subjects.Consequently, they propose that the present secretarial allowance should bereplaced by two separate allowances with maxima of  5, 500 for theemployment of a full-time secretary, and of  1,250 for part-time researchassistance.    Together, these represent an increase of 47 per cent over thecurrent  4,600 allowance, fixed at this level as an interim measure inJune 1979.   The introduction of these new arrangements would help MPs intheir work, and contribute to the better functioning of Parliament. TheTSRB consider that there should be better accountability to match these higherallowances and they propose that payments be made direct by the Fees Office tosecretaries or research assistants on the MPs&apos; behalf.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. The TSRB additionally make the suggestion (rather thanre commendation, since the matter is outside their terms oi reference) thatthe House might reconsider the question of secretaries being employees ofthe House rather than of MPs.    It is envisaged that under this arrangement,which would be optional, MPs would still select their own personnel. Howthis would work is unclear.    The advantages would be that MPs would berelieved of dealing with pay, tax and national insurance matters, and ofliabilities under Employment Protection legislation, while the secretarieswould benefit from standardised pension and redundancy pay arrangements.The accountability problem would be solved.    There would, however, be anumber of difficulties for the House authorities, as the new employer. Theywould find it difficult to accept responsibility for the management and perhapsthe careers of staff they had no part in choosing.    Also, there would beoccasions when the reallocation of an unwanted secretary, due to an MP&apos;sdeparture from the House, could be difficult.    The rest of the House staffmight also feel resentful about MPs&apos; secretaries being taken on without goingthrough the normal competition procedure.    The arrangement would, ofcourse, tend to increase costs.5. It is difficult to reconcile the various views expressed on this issue,but I consider, on balance, that the existing arrangement whereby a secretaryis an employee of the MP operates reasonably well most of the time. Iwould suggest therefore that the Government support the existing arrange-ments should the House wish to debate the matter.    On the accountabilitypoint, the Officers of the 1922 Committee were clear that existing MPs shouldcontinue to have the choice of whether to arrange payment through the FeesOffice - although they were prepared to see new MPs required to do so. Ibelieve that to make such a sharp distinction on this matter would be invidious,and I recommend that the Government should strongly urge MPs to arrange forpayment through the Fees Office, but should not oblige them to do so.    As tothe level of the allowances, I recommend acceptance of those suggested but Ibelieve it should also be possible for the individual MP to switch resourcesbetween the two allowances within the overall maximum of  6, 750.MPs&apos; PAY6. The 1979 Report of the TSRB (TSRB 12) recommended that the salariesof MPs should be increased to  12, 000 per annum with effect from 13 June 1979.We accepted this level as appropriate (so that  12, 000 is the figure used forpension purposes) but decided to move the actual salary to that figure in threestages; following the treatment for the other Review Body groups.    Half theincrease due was paid from 13 June 1979 with the remainder following in twoequal stages.    Thus, under existing Resolutions of the House, MPs&apos; pay willrise as follows:13 June 1979  9, 450 per annum13 June 1980  10, 725 per annum13 June 1981  12, 000 per annum2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALAgain following what had happened for the other Review Body groups weagreed to accept and implement a further Boyle Report updating the 1980figure.    This Report will be made to the Prime Minister in the early summer.No commitment was given to updating in 1981.    But, mindful of the strongpressure in the House for some form of linkage, the Prime Minister invitedLord Boyle to consider further some mechanism to establish an analogue withone or more professions for MPs&apos; pay.7. The TSRB had looked at proposals for linking MPs&apos; pay with othersalaries or with general indices in previous Reports, but had on eachoccasion rejected the idea because in their view the special features of theParliamentary salary made it unsuitable for such treatment.    Report No. 12acknowledged the force of the arguments put for the automatic updating ofMPs&apos; pay without the need for public debate, and suggested that, ifParliament itself wanted to pursue the concept, the use of the Department ofEmployment&apos;s New Earnings Survey (NES) to reflect movement at levels ofpay comparable to MPs afforded the best solution.    However, in discussionlast year Cabinet felt that a link with this general index might create aprecedent too easily copied by other public sector groups; more recently, ofcourse, the published Government evidence to the Clegg Commissionspecifically rejected indexation as a basis for pay determination. Havinglooked again at the position the TSRB once more conclude that there is nosimilarity between the functions and responsibilities of any professionalgroups and those of MPs, and that there is no relationship in terms of pay.They reiterate that in their view regular independent review remains the bestway of dealing with Parliamentary pay, but that, if some form of automaticupdating is required, the least unsatisfactory method is by reference to theNES.8. It is clearly difficult to recommend linkage in the light of the rejectionfr om the TSRB, and our general views as a Government on indexation.However, I am equally conscious of the very considerable pressure whichthere has been in the House for the use of an analogue as an improvement inthe way in which Parliamentary salary is updated and it might perhaps beargued that linkage with a comparable professional group (if one can be found)is not strictly &quot;indexation&quot;.9. I am sure that we shall need to offer some concession to feeling in theHouse and one alternative to a salary link would be the institution of annualBoyle reviews of MPs&apos; pay.   As part of these annual reviews, the TSRBcould be invited to take account of salary movements in the professional field,which would go at least some way towards meeting the views of our back-benchers.    (The 1922 Committee would accept this suggestion provided thatthe Government gave a commitment to implement the reports and that aprocedural way could be found to avoid an annual pay debate.)   It wouldobviously not be possible for us to give any such completely firm commitmentwith regard to the implementation of these annual recommendations, but wecan argue that good faith has already been demonstrated by our commitments3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALto pay the full 1979 recommended salary by 1981 and to accept and implementwhatever updating for MPs&apos; pay the TSRB recommends for this summer.Annual reviews could begin in 1981.    I will be exploring the procedural aspectfurther but recommend acceptance of the idea of annual Boyle reviews even ifit involves an annual debate.CONCLUSIONS10.      Accordingly, I invite the Cabinet to agree:i. to the acceptance of the TSRB 13 recommendations listed atAnnex A, except that:ii. there should be flexibility for the individual MP to switchresources between the secretarial and research allowances subject tothe overall maximum and the use of the Fees Office should beoptional;iii. on the question of secretaries becoming House employees, theGovernment will support the line that the present arrangement wherebya secretary is the employee of the MP should continue;iv. on updating MPs&apos; pay, the Government will propose annualTSRB reviews.u        I would propose that publication of the Report take place onMonday 11 February and that I announce our decisions in the House at the time f publication.    In the interim, I will make the Shadow Leader of the Houseaware of our proposals.N St J-SPrivy Council Office5 February 19804CONFIDENTIAL
