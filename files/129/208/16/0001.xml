CONFIDENTIALPAY:  IN CONFIDENCECUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT65C(80) 16 COPY NO26 February 1980CABINETCASH LIMITS AND CIVIL SERVICE PAYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. Cabinet has before it two separate memoranda, by myself and theMinister of State, Civil Service Department, about cash limits(C(80) 14 and 15 respectively).    He and I discussed these in draft last week ina Ministerial Group under my chairmanship (MISC 38) with the Secretaries ofState for Defence, the Environment and Social Services, all large employers.We all thought it would be helpful for Cabinet if I set out our provisionalconclusions, and the options from which Cabinet must now choose.2. We agreed that it is essential to maintain the generality of cash limitson the basis already decided, as set out in my paper C(80) 14.    Apart fromthe Rate Support Grant these assume a 14 per cent average increase in newpay awards and prices of current expenditure between 1979-80 and 1980-81.3. The cash limit for the Civil Service remains to be determined. TheMinister of State&apos;s paper C(80) 15 shows that the likely increase in CivilService pay settlements in a full year allowing for the pensions deduction -and this is no true deduction, since it should be happening anyway - is likelyto be about 184 per cent.    We consider it important to seek to negotiate alower figure than this.    (Quite apart from the substance, the presentationalconsequences of failure to do this would be damaging. )   But if this is carriedtoo far, we risk being defeated at arbitration or having to denounce theexisting pay agreement unilaterally at short notice, both of which we want toavoid.4. At the same time, we were in no doubt that it was impossible to set acash limit for the Civil Service Vote which implied a higher rate of inflationfrom that built into the other limits.    We therefore agreed that the 14 per centfigure must be applied to the Civil Service Vote.5. This leaves a gap of around 4f percentage points. As a percentage ofthe baseline this is just over 4 per cent.    We saw two main ways of doing this:1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALPAY: IN CONFIDENCEa. By a volume squeeze on Departments.b. By staging the implementation of the pay settlement.We cannot afford to leave the choice between a volume squeeze and pay to thestaff.    They would demand their full pay, and leave it to us to live with theconsequences for volume.    We must therefore decide upon the size of thevolume squeeze that we need to secure.6. On the volume squeeze we recognise that this will create realdifficulties for several Departments, on top of the cuts which have alreadybeen agreed.    But we need a contribution from further economy to bridge thegap, and public opinion will expect it.    We do not believe that it can beconvincingly argued that there is no scope for making reductions by a volumesqueeze, particularly if complemented by the types of study whichSir Derek Rayner has in hand.7. On staging, we considered that, although the unions and the staff wouldprotest vigorously at this breach of the agreement which would have to bebacked by denial of the right to arbitration, they were more likely toacquiesce in a staged settlement than one which clearly departed from thePay Research Unit evidence. For example 2 per cent could be saved by paying10 per cent immediately and the remainder three to four months later.8. Various permutations of these two devices are possible:  for example,1 per cent by squeeze and 3 per cent by staging, 2 per cent and 2 per cent, or3 per cent and 1 per cent.    Because Civil Service pay is negotiated centrally,we must have a single figure for staging.    There are three ways of applying avolume squeeze: the whole Civil Service could be required either to apply auniform squeeze across the board, or to repeat the pattern of cuts adopted for1979-80, or to decide on a new pattern.    We need this settled before thenegotiations, which leaves little time for the third.9. MISC 38 made two further recommendations:i. That, whatever the outcome of this year&apos;s negotiations, the wholesystem of pay research and its alternatives must be reviewed again aswell as the future of the Clegg Commission.ii. That the Civil Service Department and Departments musttogether vigorously develop management systems to control CivilService numbers and costs, department by department.10. I invite the Cabinet:i.       To agree that the decisions on cash limits already agreed shouldstand.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALPAY: IN CONFIDENCEii. To agree that the cash limit for the Civil Service Vote shouldsimilarly be set at a level which implies an average 14 per centincrease in earnings from new settlements.iii. To agree that the Civil Service Department should now opennegotiations with the Staff Side with the objective of reducing the over-all increase in the pay bill as far below 18 percent as possible, whilerecognising that there is only limited scope for this within the presentpay agreement.iv. To agree that the gap of just over 4 per cent between the likelyearnings increase and the cash limits provision should be bridged by acombination of staging and of manpower squeeze, and to determine theproportion of this to be contributed by manpower, and on what basis.v. To agree that there should be an early further review of the payresearch system and its alternatives, and of the Clegg Commission.vi. To agree that the Civil Service Department and employingDepartments be invited jointly to develop management systems tocontrol Civil Service numbers and costs; and that Sir Derek Raynershould be invited, as a matter of urgency, to advise on how hisanalysis could be exploited, both in the short and in the long run, tothis end.G HTreasury Chambers26 February 19803CONFIDENTIAL
