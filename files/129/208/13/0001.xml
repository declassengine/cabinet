CONFIDENTIALMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC&lt;80&gt;13 COPY NO    83 H12 February 1980CABINETTOP SALARIES REVIEW BODY - REPORT No. 13:PARLIAMENTARY PAY AND ALLOWANCESMe morandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of LancasterINTRODUCTION1.        Last week, I was invited (CC(80) 5th Conclusions, Minute 6) to:-a. consider further the most appropriate Parliamentaryprocesses for giving effect to increases in MPs&apos; pay;b. discuss further with representatives of opinion in theHouse, and the House authorities, the methods of payment ofsecretarial and research assistance allowances and the problemsof accountability; andc.      prepare in consultation with the Minister of State, CivilService Department, and other Ministers as necessary amemorandum on how best to examine the scope for reductionsin and controls of the cost of Parliament, including the costsfalling on Government Departments in meeting the demands madeupon them by Members of Parliament and Select Committees.PARLIAMENTARY PROCESS FOR INCREASING MEMBERS&apos; PAY2.        I have considered further the most appropriate Parliamentaryprocess for increasing Members&apos; pay and have discussed the matter withFirst Parliamentary Counsel.    Whilst I fully understand the wish ofMembers to avoid the publicity produced by an annual debate, I ampersuaded that there is no sensible way round this difficulty so long as theright to determine Members&apos; pay rests with the House itself.    It would ofcourse be possible for the annual pay resolutions to be passed without a fulldebate but this would, certainly in recent years, have ignored the varietyand strength of feeling in the House itself.   Accordingly, I conclude thatwe should continue with the existing Parliamentary procedures in the beliefthat both controversy and embarrassment will be much reduced if a patternof accepting and implementing annual Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB)reports can be established.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSECRETARIAL AND RESEARCH ASSISTANCE ALLOWANCES3. Colleagues expressed concern when we discussed these propcsedallowances about questions of accountability, most particularly if the twoallowances were to be merged.    I have discussed these issues withrepresentatives of opinion in the House and with the House authorities.Certainly, it is important for the Government to be seen to stress the needfor accountability.    However, I remain of the view that we should notultimately seek to force Members to act in a particular manner.    I am alsomindful of the very great difficulties that would be involved if we were toseek to invite the House authorities to question the word of individualmembers.    Having all this in mind, therefore, I propose that we do notseek to merge the two allowances but that we should stress very stronglyour belief that it would be right for Members to make use of the FeesOffice to arrange payment to secretaries and research assistants as some211 Members already do.THE COSTS OF PARLIAMENT4. Preliminary work has begun on a memorandum examining the scopefor reductions in and controls of the cost of Parliament and it will be broughbefore Cabinet in due course, once the necessary discussions and consulta-tions have taken place.CONCLUSION5. I invite the Cabinet to agree that:-i.       separate allowances for secretarial and research assistanceshould be introduced, as recommended by TSRB;ii.       on accountability, Members should be strongly urged tomake use of the Fee6 Office in paying their secretaries andresearch assistants;iii.       the report should be published on Thursday 14 Februaryand an announcement of our proposals should be made in theHouse at the same time.N St J SPrivy Council Office12 February 19802CONFIDENTIAL
