RECONSTRUCTION OF NATIONAL INSURANCE SCHEMESHORT-TERM BENEFITS: ADVANCE CHANGES in earnings-RE LA TED SUPPLEMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social ServicesL At their meeting on 15 June the Home and Social Affairs committee approved the following proposals and in view of the possible political difficulties invited me to put them to the Cabinet,2.        Entitlement to earnings-related supplement (ERS) is based on earnings taxed through PAYE.    The rates of ERS and the range of earnings giving ERS entitlement were described in paragraphs 11-15of the White Paper &quot;The 1971 Increases and Other Changes in social security Benefits&quot; (Cmnd. 4652) circulated to the Cabinet under cover of CP(7l) 50.    At present^ earnings in a tax year cover ERS for the ensuing benefit year which starts in May,    The implication in the Y/hitePaper was that this would continue.    In order to save manpower I am nowproposing that the start of the ERS benefit year should be deferred from may until January.3, Local offices obtain details of earnings by asking the claimant toproduce his annual certificate of pay and tax deducted (income tax formP60) or, failing that, by sending an enquiry form to his employer.    Underthe proposed arrangements for the reconstruction of the national insurancescheme (RNI) earnings information will be obtained from the computerisedcentral records of my Department at Newcastle-upon-Tyne.    Thisearnings information has been held there, on copies of tax deductioncards, since the infer eduction of the graduated pension scheme in 1961under which statutory authority (now in Section 111 of the National InsuranceAct 1965) was obtained for the disclosure of the information by the InlandRevenue to my Department.    It has not hitherto been accessible in-a formin which it could be used extensively for ERS without excessive staff costsbut computer capacity is now available which would enable this obstacle tobe overcome and I therefore propose to go over to the new system from january 1973 without waiting for the main RNI changes which are notplanned to start until April 1975.    The change would be made by regulations which would have to be submitted to the National InsuranceAdvisory Committee later this year.I 1CP(71) 74 COPY NO      6125 June 1971CABINET
4, The new system would result in a staff saving of 350 in theDepartment of Health and Social Security and the Department ofEmployment from January 1973, after a small initial increase forpreparatory work, with a more efficient service to the public anda relief for employers from form-filling.    There would also be anannual benefit saving of some  6 million from 1973-74 and an additionalonce-for-all saving of  7 million in 1973-74.    These benefit savings would result from the need to defer the start of the ERS benefit year from May to the following January in order to enable each employeefsearnings for the tax year ending in the previous April to be processedand recorded.    This would mean that in many cases the amount of ERSwould be based on earnings in an earlier tax year than at present andwould thus tend to be smaller.    It would also mean that the effect ofthe ERS changes in the current National Insurance Bill would be deferredfrom May 1973 to January 1974 with the result that higher earners wouldhave to wait eight months longer before becoming eligible for their extraERS (a maximum of about  1, 50 a week).    On these grounds someopposition to the change must be expected but I do not consider thatthis would detract from the solid advantages to be gained.5,        I seek the Cabinet&apos;s approval for this course.K department of Health and Social Security SE124 June 1971
