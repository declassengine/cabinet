INDUSTRIAL CIVIL SERVICE PAY 1971Memorandum by the Lord Privy seal the PROBLEM1.     For at least 25 years the pay of the industrial Civil Service(ICS) has been based on that for comparable work in outside industry.The extent of our commitment to this system is summarised in Annex B.As applied last year following the recommendations of the NBPI,  thesystem involves annual betterment settlements and separate productivity agreements.    On a tough interpretation it points to a centralsettlement with effect from 1 July averaging 8.7 per cent and including5.3 per cent ( 1-15) for craftsmen and 11.4 per cent  ( l-80)for the unskilled.    It would not be at all easy to reach an agreed settlement on this basis;   in particular there is small prospect of the craft unionssettling at only just over 5 per cent.    At the end of the day,  however,an average increase of about 9 per cent - rather more for the unskilledand rather less for craftsmen - would probably be accepted without serious industrial action.    I recognise,  however,  that a settlement at   per cent does not match the imperative need to bring wage increases under better control.    Moreover,  the ICS settlement will be a crucialpace-setter for other important public sector employers.2.     On the other hand,  the ICS and the Unions representing them wouldbitterly resent it if they were singled out for a low settlement whilehigher increases were still being conceded elsewhere.    In that situation we should have to face widespread industrial action,  with public sympathy strongly on the side of the men.    To discriminate against the ICS could not be squared with our long standingcommitments to comparability with pay in outside industry,  and in my judgment is not to be seriously contemplated.A NEW APPROACH3-     I can see only one tolerable way out of this dilemma.    That isthat we should hold the ICS to a low figure,  which I suggest mightbe 7^ per cent,  subject to the following 3 conditions:a. We must be prepared to face the consequences of industrial action,  possibly prolonged and almost certainly aimed particularly at the most sensitive spheres.    We have already agreed that thisshould be considered by the Official Committee on industrial disputes and I understand that our colleagues in charge of themain employing departments will be able to give us a preliminaryassessment on 26 May.    A robust attitude is essential.b. This figure must be accepted as an absolute ceiling for all new public sector settlements.1 .
c.      As the Secretary of State for Employment indicated inparagraph 5 of P(7l)38,  we must be in a position to demonstrate that we are not discriminating against the public sector and thatin one way or another,  effective pressure is being,  or will be,brought to bear on the private sector to keep settlements therewithin a tolerable ceiling.4.      The line I propose is a good deal tougher than that discussed inthe Pay Committee on 19 May (P(7l)7th Meeting, Item 2).    We were then talking in terms of increases in the range 72 Per cent to85 per cent related to a cost of living rise of about 85 per cent ayear for the rest of 1971*    With the publication of the April figure,however, the Retail Prices Index is now over 9-4 per cent higher thana year ago and even if it goes up by only a further 2 per cent overthe next 5 months,  it will then still be over 9 per cent higher thanit was 12 months earlier.    But the upward surge of the Index merelyunderlines the need for a tough policy on pay.THE ALTERNATIVE5.     If the conditions outlined in paragraph 3 cannot be met,  it ismy strong belief that there is very little chance of settling the ICSbelow about 9 per cent.    The ability of a substantial proportion of theICS to improve their earnings through productivity bargaining is nota sufficient justification for a lower figure.    The NBPI specificallyrecommended a system of betterment based on the formula plus productivityincreases.    Getting on for half of the ICS receive no productivitypayments and many of them never will.    Any overt attempt to balanceproductivity against betterment would probably lead the Unions towithdraw cooperation under existing productivity agreements,  and the consequent withdrawal of productivity payments would provoke more serious industrial action.TIMING6.     We are committed to making an offer on 7 June, but we hope toavoid a further meeting before 28 June.    I propose that our openingoffer should be 7% Per cent - anything less would almost certainlyspark off immediate and extensive trouble and even 7&quot;g per cent is most unlikely to be received quietly.   If by 28 June we are satisfied,following our consultations with the other major public sector employers,that 7^ per cent can be held over the whole front,  we will stand firmwith the ICS, but otherwise I believe it to be inevitable that we should move up towards 9 per cent.conclusion&apos;     I believe that it is essential that we should hold increases downto a maximum of 72 per cent in the next round of pay increases.    Ifthe conditions I have suggested in paragraph 3 can be met I am ready tohold the ICS down to that level.    But if we cannot agree on such a limit I see no alternative to a settlement for the ICS at about  per cent having regard to comparable earning levels elsewhere and therise in the cost of living.    We must make a preliminary offer to theICS on 7 June.    I propose that in any event that should be 7\ per cent.Civil Service DepartmentWhitehall,  SW1

This derives from the Fair Wages Resolutions passed in theHouse of Commons.    The first was in 1891 and the most recent in 1946*The Resolution itself refers only to Government contractors andrequires them &quot;to pay rates of wages and observe hours and conditionsof work not less favourable than those observed by the appropriatetrade or industry in the district in which the work is carried out or,alternatively,  than those generally observed by employers in similar circumstances&quot;.    In 1910 the Government of the day undertook toapply the terms of the Resolution to its own employees.    In January 1948the then Chancellor of the Exchequer confirmed that this undertakingapplied to the 1946 Resolution.2.      The interpretation of this commitment has varied over time.Originally, many local rates were paid and there were great variations.More recently,   rates were determined by the simple arithmeticalaveraging of the minimum time work rates payable in a selected group of industries with different calculations for craftsmen and non-craftgrades.3.      In their Report No 18 of June 1966,  the NBPI suggested major changes in the industrial Civil Service pay system.    considerable difficulties arose and the problem was tackled again in Report No I46of April 1970.    This recommended the current system of centralbetterment negotiations and departmental or local productivitynegotiations.    The betterment increase was to be calculated by a precise Formula based on the New Earnings Survey as updated by the earnings Index.4.      The previous Government responded to Report No 146 in terms which .welcomed &quot;the recommendations on the procedure for central paydetermination as a basis for early negotiations with the Trade union side&quot; but made no commitment for the future.    In negotiation on theJoint Co-ordinating Committee, the Trade Union Side explicitly statedthat they could not accept the statistical basis which the Board had recommended for determining   fair comparisons. At meetings of the JCCin February and May 1971*  the Trade Union Side have,  however,  made itclear that they would expect calculations derived from the NBPIformula to be the starting point for negotiation.    Rejection of theFormula would have to be explicit and justified.5.      Less explicitly,  it is general policy to reduce the differences in treatment between the non-industrials and industrials.    While thesystems ,of pay determination differ greatly, there must be a point at which unjustifiable discrimination could be claimed to exist.Civil Service DepartmentWhitehall,  SW124 May 1971
