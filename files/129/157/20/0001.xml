COPY NO n ,01CABINETLEGAL ADVICE AND assistance memorandum by the Lord chancellor the analysis of the Law and Order Programme in Part 1 of theAppendix to the 1971 Report by the Public Expenditure Survey Committeerefers (paragraph 22 on page 37) to my proposals for introducing a new scheme for legal advice and assistance.    The net cost is estimated at 1.3 million in 1972-1973 rising to  2. 1 million in 1975-76.    TheCabinet will wish to have further details of these proposals and myreasons for putting them forward.2. Facilities for legal advice under the Legal Aid and AdviceScheme are at present limited to oral advice given by solicitors in their offices to those whose weekly income, after making certain deductions,is  9. 50 or less.    No help can be given to the applicant in carrying outthe advice given.    The limited nature of the service has been widelycriticised for many years.    One committee after another, including therepresentative bodies of lawyers in each of the major political parties,has stressed the great importance of legal advice being made more readily available to those who cannot afford to pay a solicitor.3. My Advisory Committee has recommended the adoption of a new scheme approved by The Law Society which has come to be known as the 25 Scheme.    Under this anyone whose weekly income, after making certain deductions and allowances, did not exceed  20 would be able toobtain the services of a solicitor up to a total cost of  25 on completionof the appropriate form in the solicitor&apos;s office.    If the applicants net income was more than  11, he would pay a contribution towards the solicitor!s costs.    Provision would be made for advice being availableto persons who were unable to attend at a solicitor^ office, and thiswould fill a serious gap in the criminal legal aid scheme which makes itdifficult for persons in custody to obtain legal advice.    This is ofparticular importance at the present time when it is essential to do every-thing possible to reduce the pressure on the courst by discouraginghopeless cases from being fought out or taken to appeal.CP(71) 7021 June 19711
4. These proposals have been widely welcomed and my AdvisoryCommittee in its latest Report emphasises that it would regard it as atragic mistake if the implementation of the  25 Scheme were to befurther postponed.    It is true that the cost of legal aid as a whole is bound to rise quite substantially in the next few years, but the introductionof better facilities for legal advice will undoubtedly help to reduce expenditure on proceedings which would not have come before the courtshad proper advice been available from the outset.    I regard this as amost important social service and the estimated cost is small in relationto the benefits it will achieve.    I am quite sure that nothing will be gained by further delay and I therefore ask my colleagues to approve my proposals and to agree to the introduction of the necessary legislationnext Session.H. of St. M.Lord Chancellor^ Office, SWT18 June 19712
