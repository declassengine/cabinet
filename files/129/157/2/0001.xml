ARMED FORCES&apos; pay memorandum by the Secretary of State for defence. I seek approval on both manpower and equity grounds to increaseServicemen*s pay up to and including 1-Star officers (except doctors and dentists) by 9f per cent from 1 April.2. Pay was increased by 25 per cent in April 1970.    8 per cent served to abolish the anachronism that single Servicemen received their keep andartificially low pay which was only part of married men^s emoluments.    Ofthe remainder single men received 3 per cent last year, 15 per cent beingstaged until April 1971.    There had been only limited interim increasesbetween 1965 and 1970 because of the incomes policy of the late Administra-tion.    The subsequent National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) reviewof pay and restructuring on the basis that Servicemen should be paid on civilian principles showed that Servicemen had been greatly under-paid bycivilian standards.    Otherwise the April 1970 increase would have beensmaller.3.        We are seriously short of officer and other rank recruits.    Unless wekeep pay up-to-date by comparison with outside occupations of comparableskill and responsibility we cannot expect to persuade men to join or remainin the Services, or to be able to implement our policy with volunteer Forces,Existing pay is based on fair comparisons at 1 December 1969.    Pay normallyfalls some way behind between regular biennial reviews, but Annex A indicates that existing scales may have fallen behind by as much as 10-14 per cent aslong ago as 1 December 1970.4.        I brought my proposal before the Ministerial Steering Committee on pay Negotiations (P), who felt that the Cabinet ought to be given theopportunity of considering it, on the ground that there might be dangers forthe Governments policy on pay settlements generally if the two year agreement on military salary were breached, or if the level of any increaseawarded were not fully justified on comparability grounds.    On the latter point P asked me to clarify the extent to which the Armed Forces escapedrises in the cost of living as a result of the way the cost of their food and accommodation were treated.5. Civil Service pay has been determined on the basis of annual increases for many years. Increases after 12-18 months are normal in both public and private sectors, I think it is misleading to refer to a two year agreement on military salary. The NBPI envisaged that two years would elapse before the april 1970 Service pay scales were increased; but it had previously been1CP(71) 52 COPY NO       6219 April 1971CABINET
recognised that Interim reviews might he called for on occasion and theForces were given an assurance in that sense.    Servicemen have no Unionsor Staff Side.    In present circumstances to refuse to realign lower rankstpay for two years would be unjustg particularly since the April 1970 rates for senior officers were increased after less than a year in a realignment withother public sector top salaries,6.        All Servicemen now have to pay for food and accommodation.    On therecommendation of the NBPI Service married quarter charges were increasedto levels based on the latest information then available regarding rents paidby local authority tenants as at 31 March 1968.    The increases were stageduntil 1972 because of their size and in conformity with the policy of the time on local authority rents.    Proportionate charges for single men were notstaged.    Food charges were introduced for single men (married men alreadybought their own food like civilians) at a rate regarded by the NBPI ascomparable with what a civilian pays.    I have accepted that if pay is increasedthere will be proportionate increases in married accommodation charges andthat food charges for single men will be up-dated to reflect increased food prices.    I have also accepted that the basis of calculating food eharges maybe re-examined during the next regular review.    Servicemen have to meetother cost of living increases.7.        A 9f per cent award (corresponding to the Civil Service Central pay increase) will still fall short of restoring the comparability standards estab-lished (with our approval) in April 1970.    Substantially less would be manifestlyunfair and would cause embarrassingly large increases in April 1972.cost. The total cost in 1971-72 (including the effect on pensions) will beabout  60 million offset by about  4 million for increased charges.9. Because of the cost of the April 1970 award it was agreed not only thatit should be staged, but also that only part of it should be counted for public expenditure purposes a? a &quot;normal&quot; pay/rise increase.    The cost of thebalance was to be met by offsetting savings.    The arrangements agreed between the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence are described in Annex B.The Treasury consider that this agreement should continue to apply, ie in sofar as further pay increases were given in 1971, offsetting savings would berequired.10.       I could not, however, make such savings in 1971-72, withoutconsequences to our defence policy which we could not defend.    The increases should, therefore, I consider, be allowed to count as a pay/price increase,As Annex A explains, they will be absorbed in larger increases which must beexpected to take effect from April 1972 as the resale of the next regular payreview.    The Treasury have already agreed that these should be regardedas a pay/price increase.PJE COMME NDAT ION11.        I invite Cabinet to approve the proposal at paragraph 1 and to endorseparagraph 10.c ministry of Defence SW116 April 1971 -
ANNEX ACALCULATION OF ARMED FORCES PAY SINCE APRIL 19701.     Under the&apos;system recommended by the NBPI in its second report and put into effect following its Third Report on armed forces&apos; pay the pay of officers has been linked, to the salaries of civilian &quot;comparators&quot; by job evaluation.    The annual Hay-MSLSalary Survey provides the civilian data on which the rates for officers are based.   The present rates relate to civiliansalaries at 1 July 1969 adjusted by a 2% addition to take account of increases to 1 December 19&amp;9.   A similar relationshipwas drawn between other ranks&apos; pay and job evaluated civiliancomparators as at 1 December 1969.   Therefore the MilitarySalaries introduced on 1 April 1970 were already four months outof date.2.     For officers the 1970 Hay-MSL Survey shows increases of theorder of 9% to \0% in the salaries of the civilian comparatorsbetween &quot;1 July 1969 and 1 July 1970, of which the NBPI anticipatedonly 2% in fixing the present officers pay scales, so that officers are lagging by 7%-8% on the Hay-MSL Survey for theperiod up to 1 July 1970.   For the period 1 July 1970-1 December1970 it is not unreasonable in present circumstances to assume that further increases somewhat exceeding the 2% assumed by the nbpi to have occurred during the corresponding months of theprevious year.   On this basis an increase for officers of theorder of 105c or more seems fully justified.3.     No means exists of carrying out a similar check for other ranks short of a survey of the wages of the civilian comparatorson 1 December 1970.   This would involve an approach to over three hundred civilian firms who employ the analogues9 barely a year after they had assisted in the major job evaluation exercisesfor the 1970 Pay Review.    The retention of the goodwill and co-operation for the 1972 and subsequent biennial reviews isimportant;    therefore the Ministry of Defence is concerned notto prejudice this by making too frequent impositions on their time and effort.   However, in the opinion of Associated IndustrialConsultants who advised the NBPI on other ranks job evaluationduring the recent review and who are still associated with our continuing job evaluation studies 12% might be a conservative estimate of the civilian pay movements relevant to the positionof other ranks.   This is more than borne out by the February1971 Department of Employment Gazette (page 223) which shows anaverage movement of earnings over a wide field of 13.7&apos;,To from january to December 1970.h.     It would appear therefore that jOyi-lk0/&quot; is a reasonableindication of the extent to which Servicemens&apos; pay will havelagged behind by the end of 1970.   This of course is the &quot;ratefor the job&apos;  as assessed by job evaluation and excludes the 5%X-factor addition, which was itself assessed quite arbitrarily,and which the Forces regard as inadequate compensation for the
factors which the NBPI summarised as exposure to danger, disciplinetotal commitment to the Services and the frequent uprooting thatis inseparable from Service life.5.     The proposed increase of 9^% to take effect from April 1971is therefore within the limit of the increases of 1C$-1k?b whichare estimated to have taken place in outside occupations by theend of 1970.   The.regular Armed Forces pay review due to take effect from April 1972 will reflect not only the increases of10%-1U/&apos;o indicated above but also further wage and salary movements in outside occupations for a further 12 months up to December1971 .16 April 1971
ANNEX BTHE MILITARY SALARY:    PACKAGE agreement.     The Treasury and the Ministry of Defence agreed that the pay increases given to the Armed Forces in two stages from1 April 1970 and 1 April 1971 were of an exceptional kind inthat only a proportion of them could he regarded for puhlicexpenditure purposes as a &quot;normal&quot; pay/price increase.    Theremainder would have to he financed by offsetting savings on other categories of defence expenditure.   The two Departmentsaccordingly reached a package agreement.2.     Under this agreement the following were admitted as &quot;normal&quot;pay/price increases for which offsetting savings were not required-,a. All increases designed merely to- enable Servicemento pay tax on emoluments which had previously been tax-free .b. The pay increases which would have been due toServicemen under the &quot;Grigg&quot; system of pay determina-tion previously in force.   The &quot;Grigg&quot; system appliedbiennially:    it was nevertheless assumed that for thispurpose the &quot;Grigg&quot; system would have given increases on 1 April 1971, as well as on 1 April 1970.3.     Increases in excess of a. and b. were regarded as&quot;exceptional&quot; in that offsetting savings to meet their cost wereto be made.U.     The Treasury also, as par-t of the package, agreed in advance that whatever pay increases the Forces received at the nextreview (1 April 1972) recommended by the National Board for prices and Incomes should be regarded as &quot;normal&quot; pay/price increases for public expenditure purposes, no offsetting savingsbeing required.5.     The cost analysis of the military salary for public expenditure purposes is as follows: meet cost of the award, excluding charges recovered(rations and accommodation) 166.5Pay/Price increases admitted:a.     Tax allowance 31.5b. Amount due under the &quot;Grigg&quot; 7C- nsystem &apos;D*U106.5&quot;Exceptional&quot; element,of the Award for whichoffsetting savings were required. 60*016 April 1971- 5 -
