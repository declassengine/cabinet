EDUCATIONAL BUILDING PROGRAMMES1973-74 to 1975-76Memorandum by the Secretary of State for education and science the 1971 Report of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee(PESC) records that the agreed school building programme for england in 1972-73 includes starts of  40. 1 million for the replacement and improvement of old schools but that thereafter the replacement and improvement element is restricted to  11.3 million.    It also records(Appendix, Part One, page 41, paragraph 10) my view that this figureof  11.3 million is quite inadequate and that additional starts of at least 34 million are required in each year 1973-74 to 1975-76.   In this paper i set out the case for these claims.2. The increase in the 1972-73 programme endorsed by the Cabinetlast October represented a redeployment of only  28 million out of the savings of  102 million in the education budget which I offered last summer by increasing school meal charges and further education fees and curtailing the scope of free school milk,3. A programme of  40. 1 million in 1972-73 was a good startbut the scale of the problem is formidable.    Further starts of 230 million (England) will be needed to make good the known deficiencies.We must sustain the momentum, if we are not to break our election pledge.4. I wish therefore to allocate some  45 million in the 1973-74building programme and at least as much in each of the two subsequent years for primary school improvements in England.    The additional 34 million of starts in each year would generate expenditure of about 96 million in the PESC period (as shown in Table 2 of the Annex).Table 1 shows that, mainly because the programme for the raising of theschool leaving age (RSLA) will have been completed, the total school building programme in 1973-74 and 1975-76 would still be smaller than the1972-73 programme by some  35 million and  73 million respectively.5. The PESC Report also records  (Appendix, Part One, pages 43-44,paragraphs 20 and 25) the views of the Secretaries of State for Scotlandand Wales that their school improvement programmes also should beincreased.    The corresponding increases in expenditure during the PESCperiod would be of  11.8 million for Scotland and  9 million for Wales.CP(71) 71COPY NO21 June 1971CABINET
6. The whole of these amounts will not be a net addition to expenditureIn the interests of the primary schools in the three countries, I am ready9with the agreement of my Scottish and Welsh colleagues, to restrict therate of expansion of the universities during the next quinquennium by reducing the prospective student population for 1976-77 by at least 20, 000below the PESC 1971 figure of 341, 000.    I am also ready to reducesomewhat the proportion of post-graduate students.    While these measures would be strongly criticised as a breach of the Robbins principl e thatopportunities of access to university education for suitably qualified young people should remain constant over the years, they would save  105 million during the PESC period in capital and current expenditure (and much more in later years if this slower rate of growth were maintained).7. I need about  20 million, of this saving for improved standards  oxpolytechnics and colleges of further education in England and Wales.    Thecorresponding provision in Scotland would be  2. 3 million.    Limiting thegrowth of university places may lead to increased demands on further education and the cost of this &quot;overspill&quot; is estimated at  10 million.8. Table 3 shows that the total cost in the PESC period of all these measures - additional starts on primary school building, the improvementof further education standards and the anticipated further education over-spill - is  149, 3 million.    I am prepared to redeploy all the savings of 105 million towards this total.    This will be a clear example of our determination to match our declared priorities by a substantial and deliberate switch of resources.    These measures thus involve additional expenditure of only  44. 3 million up to 31 March 1976 - well within thefigure of net savings I achieved in last year&apos;s review (see paragraph above).9. I need a decision now to avoid a delay, for the second year in succession, in announcing the next school building programme.    There isno obvious excuse for such a delay this year, as there was last, and weshould be falling below our own standards of efficient administration.CONCLUSION10. I ask my colleagues to agree:-(a) that savings of  105 million on university expenditure should beused first to provide starts of  45. 2 million for primary schoolimprovements in England in 1973-74, corresponding expenditurein Scotland and Wales, and the expenditure on further educationdescribed in paragraph 7 above;(b) that the balance of these savings should be augmented by 44. 3 million to enable the same level of starts to be sustained in 1974-75 and 1975-76.M H t department of Education and Science, Wl18 June 1971
