PROBATION AND AFTER-CARE SERVICE pay memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. I am sorry to trouble my colleagues with another pay dispute,affecting only a small group? but the probation and after-care service has a vital role to play in maintaining law and order,, on which we placed suchemphasis in our election campaign,,2.        The present pay agreement runs from 1 April 1970 to31 December 1971 (21 months), but contains provision permitting new ratesfrom 1 April 1971 if there have been significant changes,3.        We decided some time ago to promote a large scale expansion of theservice (from 3500 now to 4700 in 1975), so as to enable a greater proportion of offenders to be treated within the community - and to avoid an even larger prison building programme (at vast expense) than is already planned.    The decision has been well received.4.        The Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay Negotiations agreed that new rates were justified from 1 April, but was unable to agree on the amountc.My colleagues thought that this should be limited to 6 per cent, to run forthe remaining 9 months of the present agreement;  or 8-9 per cent, to runfor a year.5.        I fear that this would not meet my problems,6.        The probation service is in direct competition with the local authoritysocial services.    This is an inescapable fact., which cannot be evaded ordiscounted.    1  I am not only to retain the existing service reasonably intactjbut also to build it up, I must be able to offer it conditions which stand inadequate comparison with the local authority social services.    An overallincrease of 8--9 per cent for a year would not do this, and could lead to thefollowing consequences.i.       Although wastage has not so far been serious, there is no doubtthat an inadequate settlement will result in an alarming outflow of probation officers, particularly the younger and abler, to the localauthority social services - at salaries several hundreds of poundsmore than they receive at present.    They are waiting for the resultsof the present review.    This would deal the probation service acrippling blow.1CP(71) 54 COPY NO     g26 April 1971CABINET
ii.      The local authority social services now offer entry salaries totrained recruits as much as  300 more than the probation service can offer.    If this is not put right, I shall simply not get enough recruits,I cannot cope by lowering entry standards;  there is already astruggle to get the &quot;tail&quot; through training.iii,,    If the service cannot be maintained, and indeed increased,we shall be faced with enormous problems over the treatment of offenders.    It is not easy to see how they could be tackled; but what is clear is that anything we did would be much more expensivethan increased expenditure on probation officers.7. My proposals for the basic grades are for -a. An increase of 9.4 per cent (to  2025) at the top of the scale,so as to maintain in general though at a reduced level, the leadwhich probation officers have traditionally had over most other social workers.b. Entry points for trained officers at the same level as those already being offered by local authorities.c. The possible development in the future of a link betweenprobation pay and local authority social service pay.8. The Secretary of State for Scotland is troubled by a, because he says that Scottish general purpose social workers carry greater respon-sibilities than English probation officers,    This I simply do not accept.9, The Secretary of State for Employment is troubled by a and bbecause together they produce an overall increase of 13 per cent over12 months; and he is troubled about c because of the irresponsibilityof local authorities.    On c I hope that we can bring the local authorities under greater control? but I do not think that we can hold the probationservice back on this round.    We have to cope with the situation as it hasalready been allowed to develop.    I see very clearly the difficulties abouta and b* but in presenting the decision publicly I would hope that we couldconcentrate on the improvement at the top (9. 4 per cent) rather than onthe consequences of improvements on entry points.    I also am preparedto accept, if my colleagues preferred, that the settlement should run only for the 9 months from 1 April to 31 December 1971, so that the overalladditional cost this calendar year would be about 9. 75 per cent.10.       I believe that a decision on the lines suggested would commandParliamentary and public support.    The future of the probation service is a matter of widespread concern.CONCLUSION11.       I seek my colleagues&apos; agreement to the treatment of the probationservice as a special case by the adoption of the proposals set out inparagraph 7.R m home Office SW126 April 1971 2
