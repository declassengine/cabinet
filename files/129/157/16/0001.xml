TIKIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(71) 66 COPY NO 604 June 1971CABINETOCCUPATIONAL, PENSIONERS AND UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services* I am circulating to members of the Cabinet the attached text of a paper about occupational pensioners and unemployment benefit which Ihave submitted to the Home and Social Affaire Committee for consideration at their meeting on Monday 7 June.2, I propose to make an oral report to Cabinet as soon as the Homeand Social Affairs Committee has reached a decision on my paper.K department of Health and Social Security SE14 June 1971
With the agreement of the Committee (SL(71 )5th Meeting, item 3), andsubsequently of Cabinet, I included in the National Insurance uprating bill now before Parliament a clause (clause 7) which sought to limit the misuse ofunemployment benefit by people who retire from their career employment with substantial occupational pensions and who are only doubtfully, if at all, inthe employment field.   The main proposals in the clause, applying only tooccupational pensioners over 60, were as follows:-(l) those with pensions of  30 a week or more would be disqualified for benefit unless they had demonstrated their continued attachment tothe employment field by working for six months after retirement ina new jobj and(2) any benefit otherwise payable (ie where the &quot;further work&quot; test in(1) was satisfied or did not apply) would be reduced by the excessof the occupational pension over  1 8 a week (the &quot;sliding scale&quot;).2.     Clause 7 of the Bill was lost in Standing Committee on 27 May, having been opposed by the Opposition and having failed to gain sufficient support- from our side of the Committee.   The Bill is due to be reported to the House next week, and there will be an opportunity then to restore the lost clause.3.    The principal objections of our supporters to clause 7 are that they seethe sliding scale as creating a dangerous precedent by applying a means testto a benefit which should be paid as of rightj and that the requirement topass a test of further work assumes indiscriminately that everybody with apension of  30 a week or more is &quot;guilty&quot; of not being available for work until he proves his innocence.   We have of course always been aware of these objections, but, like our predecessors, we reluctantly aocepted the advice of the National Insurance Advisory Committee (NIAC) that there is no satisfactory method of testing availability for work in these cases and thatthe admittedly arbitrary provisions of clause 7 are the best we can do.4.    In these circumstances, -it may well -be that we should drop the clause,except for sub-section (11), which, is I think noiL-controversial.   This sub-section is in accordance with a recommendation of NIAC (supported byLord Collison, who dissented from the main, recommendations) that case law which is already applied in practice by. the adjudicating-authorities should beput into statutory form.   This will, enable-the authorities to disqualifyoccupational pensioners for benefit if they refuse a suitable job on thegrounds that it is not in the occupation from which they have retired.2
5.    If clause 7 were to be dropped I would propose to move amendments to takeout the concession in clause 1 of the Bill which makes the payment of non-employed persons&apos; contributions voluntary after the age of 60.   This was a concession designed to assist in making clause 7 acceptable.6.    The saving which would be forgone if we proceeded in this way is estimated to be some  2 million a year.   I am advised by the Chief Whip that an attemptto restore the clause is bound to be unsuccessful.7.    On the other hand, there is evidence that the number of unemployment benefitclaims by occupational pensioners has increased considerably in recent years nodoubt stimulated by continuing publicity, and I fear that if the clause weresimply dropped, claims might increase even more, with consequent increased costs.8.    My colleagues may therefore consider that we should attempt to restore theclause to the Bill, or, failing this, at the very least to make sure that our case for the clause is put properly on record.   In speaking to an amendment to restore the clause I would propose to make it quite clear that the unemploymentbenefit system was not designed for people who retire with substantialoccupational pensions, particularly in areas where there are no suitable jobs.This would enable us to show that we are as much concerned with middle classabuse as with abuse by the wage earner.conclusion.    The question is therefore whether we should: -(1) make no attempt to restore clause 7 of the National Insurance bill at Report Stage except for sub-section (11); or(2) attempt to restore the clause but not force the matter to a vote ifit receives a hostile reception from our backbenchers.   I would proposeto sound out opinion in the back-bench social security committee inadvance of the debate.KJDepartment of Health and Social security london SE13 June 19713
