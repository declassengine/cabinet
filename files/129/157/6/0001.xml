REORGANISATION OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE;APPOINTMENT OF HEALTH authorities memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. My proposals for the reorganisation of the National Health Service(NHS) were discussed by the Cabinet on 1 April (CP(71) 19th Conclusions^Minute 5).2. In general they were approved, but fehe Cabinet asked me to reconsider the proposals for the appointment of members of the new authorities, and seek to reconcile the needs of sound management with the demand for localrepresentative participation.    It was suggested that while all the members ofthe regional health authority (RHA) might be appointed by me, as proposed,a proportion of the members of the area health authority (AHA) might beappointed by the local authority.3. I still think it is right, in the centrally financed NHS, to emphasise the management function of the AHA rather than seek to give it arepresentative role.    This means that the AHA should be small, and Ipropose that in about 70 of the areas the membership should be kept downto 14 plus the chairman.    A few additional members will be needed in the17 or so remaining areas which include substantial medical and dentalteaching facilities.    It also means that at least the majority of the members should be chosen for their managerial capacity.    But to meet the views that were expressed at the meetings of the Social Services Committee and theCabinetj I now propose that three members of each AHA should be directlyappointed by the matching local authority.    This will have managerial aswell as representational value, in that it will provide room for people whoare active in the discharge of the local authorityTs responsibilities for the personal social services, education and the environmental health services,for which close links between the two authorities are essential.4. I also propose that one member (increased to two where the areaincludes a teaching district) should be appointed by the University providingmedical and dental teaching facilities.180CP(71) 56 COPY no May 1971CABINET
5. The 1970 Green Paper proposed that the health professions^ as wellas the local authority^ should themselves appoint members cf the area authority,, and the professions will resent not being given a right of directappointment when the local authorities have it.,    But while for managerialeffectiveness each area authority ought to Include members withprofessional knowledge^ I do not think we shall get the most suitablepeople and a good, balance of ability and experience if the right of appointment is given to the professional organisations themselves.   InsteadI propose that an undertaking should be given that at least two doctors andone nurse or midwife (three being also the number of local authoritymembers) will be appointed by the RHA after consultation with the professions.6. These changes will not entirely satisfy the local authorities or the professions; nor do they go as far as the half-local authority;, half-professional, representation mentioned as a possibility by our spokesmanwhen we were in opposition.    But, while they are the most I consideradvisable managerially, they will demonstrate our wish to give somerecognition to representational participation by the local authorities,,7. The Social Services Committee on 28 April approved the amendedtext of the consultative document incorporating this change (subject to myconsulting with the Secretary of State for the Environment about a referenceto payment of chairmen? this has since been agreed).    The draft document is attached as Annex 1.8, I ask the Cabinet to agree that the consultative document should bepublished,K department of Health and Social Security SE14 May 1971
NHS REORGANISATION: CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENTFOREWORD BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL services the legislation which brought the National Health Serviceinto being is now a quarter of a century old.    the structural framework within which health care is providedremains as it was more than a generation ago.    Traditionallyseparate and distinct elements - hospitals,  family practitioner services, community care - were then enlistedin the common cause of promoting (in the words of the Act)&quot;a comprehensive health service designed to secureimprovement in the physical and mental health of thepeople&quot;.That improvement has undoubtedly come about and willcontinue.    But it is clear that the creaking structurewithin which the governing bodies,  the doctors, the nurses,the administrators and all the other health service staffmust work, simply does not match up to modern needs for the delivery of comprehensive health care.   What the publicneeds and what the Health Service itself has increasinglycome to demand,  is a service organised so that its separateparts are planned and operated, not in fragments but as awhole .The debate about means of achieving this has been going onnow for a decade.    Two Green Papers on the structure of theNational Health Service have been published.   We are perhaps in danger of a surfeit of plans and prospectuses: theremust be early decisions, so that enthusiasm for reformdoes not wither away.There is in fact a very wide measure of agreement on the basic element of reform - the replacement of the presentfragmented structure by an integrated service - and on the consequential need for changes in the organisation of thehospital and community health services at each level of management.    There is, moreover,  substantial agreement onthe general implications of those changes.    At regional levelthey imply an organisation with the primary responsibilityof overall planning of services and allocation of resources to the areas within the regions.    At the operating level,they imply an organisation so constructed as to match the boundaries of the new health services authorities withthose of the new local authorities administering the relatedpersonal social services,  and so linked with those authoritieas to stimulate a close and continuing co-operation whichis often regrettably lacking at present.   And they implyeffective arrangements for the management of theindividual hospitals, health centres and other unitsproviding health care in each community.annex
Because discussion of health service reorganisation has gone on for so long a time, the reader may not readilygrasp just how far-reaching the changes we now proposereally are.   They involve the disappearance of all the health Service bodies as we now know them - regional hospital boards, hospital management committees,  boards of governors of teaching hospitals, executive councils and local health authorities.   All the services whichthese bodies now provide, whether in hospital or in thecommunity, will become the responsibility of a comprehensive two-tier structure embodying regional and area health authorities.   Those authorities will themselves administer the unified personal health services and in partnership with reorganised localgovernment, will co-ordinate them with the personal social services.No useful purpose would be served by another analysis ofthe issues on which there is general agreement and sothis consultative document deliberately limits itself tothe relatively narrow, though very important, range ofother issues on which consultation is needed and commentsare invited.   When comments on our proposals have been   ,received and considered, I shall publish a White paper containing the Governments decisions and a statement ofthe principles on which legislation for an integratedNHS will be based.As the document&apos;s brief statement of the governments proposals for a new health service structure makes clear,their essence - and their basic difference from earlier proposals - is the emphasis they place on effectivemanagement.    The importance of good management in makingthe best use of resources can hardly be overstated.    Itunderlies the document&apos;s proposals for strengthening the regional organisation in relation to the service as awhole, and in drawing clear lines of responsibility andaccountability throughout the levels of authority.The success of the proposals will indeed,  in a general sense,  depend on the quality of management.   The health service is one of the country&apos;s largest enterprises, interms of money spent, staff employed and facilities required.    It cannot prosper without managerial skill.The work of the existing Health Service boards and committees has had to be done within the crampingconfines of an unsatisfactory and increasingly outmodedstructure.   Advances in management efficiency cannotrealistically be looked for in a continuation of thatstructure.Each of the new managing bodies will employ staffs ina wide range of professional and other disciplines andnumbered in thousands, and will administer annual4
COMFSDENTSALbudgets running into millions (in some cases many millions)of pounds.   Much will depend on the vision and skill ofthe health and social services leaders.   We shall take steps to create a mutual awareness of each other&apos;s tasksand methods.    It will be our aim to improve the trainingarrangements for senior staff so that we may developmanagers trained to consider and,  in collaboration with local authorities and voluntary organisations,  to serve the total needs of their areas.It is important to remember that the balanced developmentof the health services depends not only on administrativeunification but also on the provision of social care inthe community and of residential accommodation for groupssuch as the physically or mentally handicapped,  and the elderly.   These personal social services have alreadybeen brought together under the new social servicescommittees of the local authorities and, under theGovernments proposals for reorganised local governmentin England, will remain with the new county and metropolitan district authorities.   Neither the Government,nor their predecessors, have proposed full administrativeunification of the health and related personal social services.    But as comprehensive care of the citizendepends on both sets of services,  strong and bindinglinks between them will be of fundamental importance.The Government have already decided upon matchingboundaries between the new health authorities and the localauthorities providing personal social services.    This willprovide a structural framework within which the separateauthorities can jointly plan and develop their complementaryservices,  but it will be one of the key tasks in theperiod up to April 1974 - when the reorganised health service and local government take effect - to deviseways in which they can be linked for effective policy-making.I have already related the success of the governments proposals to the quality of management.    Success willalso of course depend heavily on those professions working in the Health Service, including the administrators.Doctors have played a large part in the planning and management of the existing service and will continue todo so in the future.    But the other professions will also have a part to play in guiding the new service.    the nurses provide an indispensable service in the hospital and in the home, and in the preventive as well as thecurative aspects of illness; the size and complexity ofthis service demand good management if efficiency and economy are to be secured,  and in recent years nurses have5
become increasingly well prepared to take their part inthe management of the National Health Service at all levels.   The professional staff now in local authorityemployment who will move to the new health authorities -the doctors, the dentists, and the nursing and midwiferystaff - will also bring particularly valuable experience to the planning and provision of integrated care.A unified service will enable the staff now working inthe separate parts of the health service to make betteruse of their skills and experience.    I am confident that members and staff of the health service authorities will welcome the opportunity to improve the framework withinwhich they do their work.    It will be our joint aim toconstruct a service with a new vigour and a greatercapacity for achievement.KEITH JOSEPHSecretary of Statefor Social services
CONSULTATIVE document.   On 5 November 1970 the Secretary of State for social services stated in reply to a Question in the House ofCommons by Dr Gerard Vaughan -&quot;The Government intend to unify the administrationof the National Health Service.    Legislation will bring the change into effect at the same time asalterations are made in the structure of localgovernment.The National Health Service will be administered byhealth authorities outside local government workingclosely with the local authorities responsible forthe personal social services and the public health services.   The Government are not satisfied however that the detailed administrative proposals in the green Paper of February 1970 would create an efficientstructure of a unified service.    They are studying the comments made on the proposals,  and before reaching final decisions of their own, will consult with the organisations concerned.&quot;2.   The Government has announced its decisions on the futurestructure of local government in England in Cmnd 4584.   Thisstates that the local authority personal health services willbe transferred to the new health authorities,  and that the aim is to bring the reorganisation of local government andof the National Health Service into operation on1 April 1974.3.   Work is now starting on the preparation of thelegislation needed to unify the administration of theNational Health Service.   The unified structure willincorporate the personal health functions which,  since the1946 Act set up the Service, have been exercised by localauthorities, including the provision of health centres, the health care of mothers and young children, midwifery,health visiting, home nursing, ambulance services and theprevention of illness.    It will not however incorporate the functions which (although they derive from the originalNational Health Service Act) are now discharged throughthe new local authority social service committees,  set upfollowing the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970,namely home help, certain other social care services andcertain residential services.   These personal social services will continue to be the responsibility of thelocal authorities.4.    For the purpose of this legislation early decisions are needed on certain important matters.    The Secretary ofState now invites views on the tentative conclusions he has reached on these after studying the Green Paper of 
February 1970 and the comments made on the proposals it contained.    There are many other matters on which decisions will have to be taken before the reorganised service comes into operation.   Arrangements will be made for discussingthem with those concerned at a later stage.   The provisional conclusions on which comments are now invited are set outin the following paragraphs.5.   The administrative arrangements will fully preserve the clinical freedom of those who provide services topatients;    they will help to ensure that the services are provided quickly and effectively;    and they will secure a close co-ordination of aims and of day-to-day action both within the unified National Health Service and with related services, especially those run by local authorities.Collaboration with voluntary organisations,  too, willcontinue to be developed.6.    It is proposed that throughout the new administrative structure there should be a clear definition and allocation of responsibilities;    that there should be maximumdelegation downwards, matched by accountability upwards;and that a sound management structure should be created atall levels.   The line of delegation downwards (with corresponding accountability upwards) will be from theCentral Department to regional health authorities,  andfrom the regional health authorities to area health authorities.   The aim will be to set clear objectives and standards,  and measure performance against them.   Thecreation of a strong regional tier is one of the maindifferences between the present proposals and the 1970Green Paper.    In the Government&apos;s view, direct supervision of some 80 to 90 area authorities by the Central Department,as proposed by the previous Government, would not makemanagerial sense.AREA HEALTH AUTHORITIES7o   The area health authorities will be the operationalNational Health Service authorities, with responsibilityfor planning, organising and administering comprehensivehealth services to meet the needs of their areas.   Each area authority will also be responsible for the management of theintegrated health services in the various parts of itsarea (&quot;districts&quot;) served by separate district general hospitals and the community health services associated withthem.   The detailed management arrangements,  at both member and officer level, in the area headquarters,  in the districts,and in the individual hospitals and other institutions,are matters on which it is the Secretary of State&apos;s intentionto set on foot an expert study in consultation with people8
from among those concerned.    This will take account ofthe present arrangements for the administration of theindividual parts of the National Health Service,   includingthe role of the professional hospital administrator;    of current developments in the organisation of medical and nursing work in accordance with the Cogwheel and SalmonReports;    and of the views of the Hunter working party on medical administrators.   The study will be started at anearly date, as its results need to be available in time for incorporation in the management structures set up by thenew authorities.8.   The boundaries of the area health authorities willbe the same as those of the counties (other than themetropolitan counties) and the metropolitan districtsproposed for local government in Cmnd 4584.   On thisfooting there will be about 70 of them in England, outside london.   As the Green Paper of February 1970 recognised,there must be firm links and arrangements for close collaboration with the matching local authorities.    Butthe Green Paper did not make comprehensive proposalsfor achieving this.   An effective mechanism is essential for the mutually agreed planning of, and investment in,the health and related local authority services.   Therewill be provision for working together in day-to-dayoperations and for sharing supply and other ancillary services.   The arrangements should cover, too, the provisionof advice and services to the health authority by the localauthority through its social services department and its staff,  and to the local authority by the health authority&apos;scommunity physicians and other medical staff,  dentistsand nurses including those transferred from local authorityto health authority employment.   In particular, it will benecessary to ensure that local authorities continue to havethe medical advice they need for the effective dischargeof their functions in education, the personal social services,  and the environmental health services.   TheSecretary of State proposes the early establishment of a working party, representative of the interests concerned,to study these matters in detail.    Its recommendations,like the results of the study referred to in paragraph 1,will need to be available well before the new authoritiestake over their responsibilities.REGIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES9.    The regional health authorities will be responsiblefor the general planning of the National Health Service(including the specialties and, in consultation with the universities, the service facilities to be provided insupport of medical teaching and research) in each region;for allocating resources to the area health authorities;and for co-ordinating their activities and monitoring9
their performance (including the effectiveness of theirlinks with the matching local authorities)  to ensurethat national and regional objectives are achieved andthat the desired standard of service is provided.   Thiswill place on the regional authorities a real managementresponsibility within the chain of command and will give them a very different function from that of the regional health councils proposed in the 1970 Green Paper.   Inaddition the regional authorities will themselves provide some services and will be the building authorities forall major projects.10.   The areas of the regional health authorities willbe based on the 14- planning regions hitherto adopted forthe hospital service, except that,  subject to consultations with those concerned locally,  it is proposed to divide the present Sheffield hospital region into two healthregions based on the medical teaching centres atNottingham and Sheffield respectively.11.   The detailed management arrangements at the regional level will be included in the study to which reference is made in paragraph 7.CENTRAL DEPARTMENT12.   In discharge of the Secretary of State&apos;responsibility to Parliament for the National health service as a whole,  the Central Department will determinenational objectives, priorities and standards and allocateresources to the regional authorities.    these responsibilities will - as at a lower level with the regional health authorities in respect of the area health authorities - not involve detailed control but will inevitably carry with them an ultimate responsibility forthe quality and effectiveness of management and for themonitoring of performance.    The existing HospitalAdvisory Service has demonstrated the value of expertvisiting advisory teams in psychiatric and geriatrichospitals, which contain over half the hospital beds in the National Health Service.   Ways of gatheringinformation, and disseminating advice,  on successfularrangements for linking together the planning and operation of health authority and related local authority services will also be studied.13.   The organisation of the Department of Health and social security is being reviewed, with the help of management consultants, to ensure that it will be fully equipped tocarry out its functions.   The staff who are concerned withthe central administration of the National Health Serviceneed to include people with direct experience in thefield;    and the Department must also be properly advised on
professional and technical progress,  so that it can try to foresee and provide for developments based on newtechnical advances.MEMBERSHIP OF AUTHORITIES14.   The new health authorities will have important and complex management functions to perform,  demanding oftheir members skill and experience of a sort that willenable them to give guidance and direction on regionalor area objectives to their staff.    The authorities willbe kept small and management ability will be the maincriterion for the selection of members.15*    It would therefore be inappropriate for theauthorities to be composed on the representational basisproposed in the 1970 Green Paper.16.   The Chairman and all the members of the regionalauthority will be appointed by the Secretary of Stateafter consultations with the interested organisationsincluding the universities, the main local authoritiesand the main health professions.17.   The chairman of the area authority will be appointedby the Secretary of State, and the members (who mightnumber 14 in addition to the chairman, except that ares which include a teaching district - see paragraph 23 below -will need a few additional members) will be appointed asfollows:a     three by the corresponding local authority.This will enable the local authority to choose members who are active in the dischargeof its responsibilities for the personal social services, education and other services forwhich close management links between the twoauthorities are essential;b     one by the university providing medical and dental teaching facilities (a second memberwill be so appointed in areas which include ateaching district);c     the rest by the regional authority, afterconsultation with the interested organisationsincluding the main health professions.    It isimportant for management efficiency that,  inaddition to the local authority and universitymembers, each area authority should contain adiversity of relevant ability and experience.This part of the membership will thereforeinclude at least two doctors and a nurse ormidwife, appointed after consultation with the professions.1 1
18.    It is intended that strong professional advisorymachinery should be established at both regional and area level.19.   There will be power to remunerate on a part-time basis the chairmen of regional and area authorities.COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS20.   The previous paragraphs deal with the creation ofa strong management structure for the regional and area authorities.    It is also important to have more effective representational mechanisms by which localattitudes can be known and safeguards built in.    Butit would not be right to incorporate these mechanismsin the management structure.   The previous Governmentsought to secure increased local participation in theadministration of the health services not only by giving the area authorities a representational character,but also through the establishment of district committeescomposed, as to half their membership, of people living or working in the district.    In the present Governments view,these proposals would have led to a dangerous confusionbetween management on the one hand and the community^reaction to management on the other.    Instead,  the area health authority will be required to set up a community health council for each of its constituent districts.This will ensure that in making plans and operatingservices, area authorities take full account of the viewsof the public they serve.   The council will be appointedafter consultation with a wide range of interested localorganisations.   It will be consulted on the development and operation of the health services in the district, andits members will have the right to visit hospitals andother institutions.   It will produce an annual report.FAMILY PRACTITIONER SERVICES21 o   The family practitioner services occupy a centralposition,  and the area health authority will be closely concerned with plans for their development - for example,at health centres and by attachment schemes, in whichnurses and health visitors work together with practitionersin close collaboration with other parts of the unifiedNational Health Service and with the personal social services.22.   To administer the contracts of the familypractitioners - doctors, dentists, pharmacists andopticians - the area authority will be required to setup a committee, with a composition like that of the12
present Executive Councils.   On this matter thecommittee will deal direct with the Central department and will be separately financed.TEACHING DISTRICTS23.   There will be special arrangements for districts where there are substantial facilities for medical and dental clinical teaching.   These special arrangements,which are set out in Appendix 1,    are designed to enablethe teaching hospitals to play a fully integrated role inthe reorganised health services - to the benefit of allthe health services in the districts in which they are situated - while retaining their individual identityand historic traditions and maintaining the specialservices they provide.ENDOWMENTS24.   The public will be encouraged to continue to supportendowment funds;    and provision will be made in thelegislation to protect their local character and control,on the lines set out in Appendix 2.LONDON25.   The arrangements in Greater London will be based onthe general regional and area structure set out above but will need to be specially shaped to meet conditions there,including the already established pattern of localgovernment services, the distribution of hospitals(including teaching hospitals), the presence of separatepostgraduate teaching hospitals and the wide coverage ofthe existing Executive Councils.   There will be separateconsultations on these problems with the organisations concerned.GENERAL26.   Paragraphs 6-24 and the two appendices set outthe Governments tentative proposals on which early commentsare needed to enable final decisions to be reached and work on the preparation of legislation to proceed.   Therewill be separate opportunities for views to be expressed on other matters, including arrangements for the transitional period.27o   Organisations are requested to send their commentsto the Department of Health and Social Security, HSODivison,not later than THE END OF JULY 1971Department of Health and social SecurityMay 1971 Alexander Fleming HouseLondon SE113
CONFIDENTIALAPPENDIX special ARRANGEMENTS FOR TEACHING DISTRICTSThese districts will be administered as part of the areasin which they are situated.    But, to help in achieving the objects set out in paragraph 23 ie to secure that theinclusion of the teaching hospitals will benefit all the health services in the districts in which they are situated,to retain hospitals&apos; individual identity and historictraditions, and to maintain the special services they provide,there will be the following arrangements:-(a) the regional health authority will appoint aspecial regional committee to deal with planningmatters relating to teaching and research;(b) expenditure for the services in a teaching districtwill be separately identified in the regional health authority&apos;s approval of expenditure for thearea;(c) the area health authority will be required toappoint a district committee to manage the services in each teaching district  (which will normallycarry the teaching hospital&apos;s name).    This committeewill consist partly of members of the area authorityitself and partly of others; in the early years ofthe reorganised service, the Secretary of state will appoint the chairman and some members; it will doubtless usually hold its meetings at the teachinghospital;(d) when a consultant is being chosen to serve in ateaching district, the advisory appointmentscommittee will always include in its, membershipone or more members nominated by the districtcommittee; and(e) arrangements will be made for one or two membersof existing Boards of Governors and UniversityHospital Management Committees to be appointed to each of the area authorities concerned and to eachteaching district committee.14
APPENDIX 2ENDOWMENTS1.     Endowments other than those belonging to Boards of governors and University Hospital Management committees will be vested in the area health authority and appliedand administered by it according to the categories in whichthey fall:(a) those held for &quot;special purposes&quot; will continueto be applied only for purposes within the scopeof the trust;(b) those held for the &quot;general purposes&quot; of aparticular hospital will continue to be applied only for the purposes of that hospital;(c) those held for the &quot;general purposes&quot; of a hospital Management Committee will become available for application within the area ofthe successor area health authority, and willbe available not only for hospital purposes (towhich they are at present limited) but for any purpose relating to the health services providedfor the people of the area, including research and capital works.2.     Endowments vested in Boards of Governors and UniversityHospital Management Committees   will be vested in the teachingdistrict committee.    It will be made possible for the districtcommittee to apply funds in category (c) for any purposerelated to the health services provided for the district,not only for hospital purposes.15
