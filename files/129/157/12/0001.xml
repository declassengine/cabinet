NATIONALISED INDUSTRY policy memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy (EPC) have reviewedpolicy on the nationalised industries.    They have been greatly assisted bythe work of the Ministerial and Official Sub-Committees, whose reportscovered the whole range of activities, except for four areas (the british steel Corporation (BSC), the ports, National Coal Board (NCB) anciliariesand the Post Office Giro) that are currently the subject of separate studies,2.        EPC tackled the task from the standpoint that, although our dispositionwould be to reduce the public sector involvement unless there was good reason for ita a doctrinaire approach was to be avoided; our concern was topromote the most efficient use of resources for the benefit of consumers andtaxpayerss and not with change for its own sake.    &quot;We make some specific proposals for reducing public participation;, but on any reckoning the public sector will remain large; we therefore recommend a new and more effectiveregime of accountability and control aimed both at improved efficiency andcreating conditions more favourable to the attraction of private capital whenappropriate.3.        Reduced public participation can be achieved either through outrightsale or the introduction of private risk capital, preferably as a step towardstransfer of control to the private sector.    This will, as explained furtherat paragraph 6 below, Initially at least have to be confined almost entirely to ancillary activities.    Where the parent Board are unwilling to co-operate in seeking private capital, restricting the access of the activity concerned to the National Loans Fund (NLF) would compel them to do so, unless the activity could generate all its capital requirements internally or the 3oarddecided to discontinue it.    (Restricting access to the NLF may be mor significant as a means of limiting the extension of nationalised IndustriesTactivities than in reducing their current ancillary activities, for which NLFdrawings are no more than  10 million a year).    Organisation of the ancillaryactivities into Companies Act companies, where this is not already done,would both clarify the financial situation of the activity and facilitate theintroduction of private capital.    But while an activity has a public stake ofany size the Government will retain some moral, if not legal, responsibility and may be unable to stand entirely aside.    So outright sale is preferable to joint ventures although each case needs individual consideration.1CP(71) 62 COPY NO    6024 May 1971CABINET
4,        Private capital will net be attracted unless the potential security and return on investment are comparable with private industry.    We see nopoint in introducing private loan capital (which would only be Governmentdebt under another name and would not introduce private sector disciplines),,or in seeking at this stage to encourage a minority private stake inprofitable (or potentially profitable) mainline activities which cannot be fully denationalised, such as the public utilities? and it would clearly beimpossible to persuade private investors to put risk capital into unprofitableones such as coal mining, the railways or the buses.    Even in other cases there are important constraints on our ability to bring in private investment,and we can hope to succeed only to the extent that we are willing to restMinisterial control and Parliamentary accountability on strategic oversightof the industries, and to give up the right to intervene in detail, for exampleon grounds of regional;, prices or incomes policies^ save for overridingreasons.    In present circumstances, this is obviously a point of considerable importance.5.        Thus &apos;ih.e development of a new relationship between Miniseers, theindustries and Parliament Is as necessary in this context as it is to raising the industriesr own efficiency? we need to encourage management to adopt a vigorous commercial attitude and, at &apos;3ie same time- to ensure that theindustries operate in accordance with the wider national interest.    present arrangements leave the Government too little strategic control, and theindustries without clearly defined objectives while subject to an unhealthydegree of intervention and inquiry in detail which reduces their propermanagement freedom and responsibility.    Paragraphs 5-7 of Annex Adescribe the main features of the new regime of accountability and controlwe advocate; and paragraph 8 th? changed emphasis in accountability toParliament.    As a next step, these proposals would be set out in a consultative document, which we recommend should be discussed with theindustries,6.        Against this background we have considered the future of each of theindustry^ main and ancillary activities.    As candidates for outrightdenationalisation, we considered that many should be ruled out at onces themainline activities of the coals steely gas and electricity industries, the postal and telecommunications services, the railways.7,        Others we concluded should be ruled out as prospects for actionwithin, say, the lifetime of this Parliaments the civil airlines, the british airports Authority, British Rail ports and engineering workshops, theBritish Waterways Board, the National Bus Company and Scottish TransportGroup buses, Cable and Wireless - although possibilities of selling orintroducing private capital into particular parts of these concerns will bekept in mind.8. On somej action is already in hand; the disposal of most of theactivities of the Transport Holding Company, the two shipping companiesowned by the National Freight Corporation and some shipping and hotelservices operated by the Scottish Transport Group,2
9. For the rest, our conclusions are given In Annex      which alsoIndicates the cases where legislation may be needed.    Their implementationwill require detailed discussion with the board chairmen concernedfl both onthe timing of action in each case and on the most suitable method of reducingpublic participation.    We envisage its taking place in parallel with discussionof the proposed new regime of accountability and control and would expect allthe consultationss including those which the responsible Minister? arealready having on the ancillary and diversified activities of the NCB and the bsc, and on the Post Office Giros to be substantially completed by the summer Recess.10.        The limited scops for outright disposal disclosed by the review showsthat the setting up of a public sector realisations agency to handle all saleswould not be justified; the need for Ministers to retain control of investment and borrowing, and the adverse effects on management of another body to supervise the undertakings outweigh such advantages as an investment orholdings agency might have.    The objective of reducing the industriesTcalls on public funds is best met by improved Ministerial control under thenew arrangements proposed in paragraph 5.11.        The discussions with the industries should take place in confidence.But we mu3t recognise the danger of a leak once they start, particularly inthe present mood of general uncertainty within the industries.    We therefore considered the question of making an early statement of the Governmentsaims and intentions, but in advance of the detailed consultations with theindustries this would necessarily be inconclusive; it would thereforeincrease rather than reduce uncertainty and make no worthwhile politicalimpact.    We believe that announcements should be confined to decisions onwhich there is to be immediate actions, as and when they are takens and thatno public reference should be made to the hope of reducing public participa-tion in a particular activity..   However an appropriate occasion will need tobe found in due course for a statement on the new regime of accountabilityand control,12.        I invite the Cabinet &quot;i. To endorse the proposals for a new reg?.me for accountabilityand control (paragraph 5 and Annex A) and EPCts conclusions aboutthe future of particular nationalised industry activities(paragraphs 6-9 and Annex 3).ii. To agree that we should now have detailed consultations withthe nationalised industries (paragraph 9).iii. To agree that there should be no general or immediate announcement of policy, and that statements should be made only when we have specific decisions to announce (paragraph 11).A treasury Chambers SW121 May 19713
ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROL OP the nationalised industries memorandum by the Chairman of the Ministerial Sub-Committeeon Nationalised Industry policy.     Since only the Government is ultimately responsible for the nationalised industries, there is a conflict between the importance of encouraging their managements to adopt a vigorous commercial attitude and the need to ensure that they are operated in accordance with the wider national interest.   Present methods of dealing with this conflicttend to produce too little control for the Government and, at the sametime, too little freedom and responsibility for managements.2.     The Sub-Committee, therefore, agree with the Official Sub-Committeein emphasising that Ministers must, while retaining overall control ofpolicy, be prepared to relax their control of more detailed matters,leaving day to day management to the Boards.   Conversely the Boards must recognise that Ministers have under Parliament the absolute rights thatin the private sector are secured by sole ownership.   When private capitalis introduced, Ministers&apos; rights are correspondingly reduced.3.    We agree that this is the only way to make the Boards fullyaccountable for their performance;   and that these are the only conditionsin which it will be possible to attract any significant amount of private capital into the nationalised industries.4.     Against this background the Government must first decide what, in thelight of its social and economic policies, should be the object of eachundertaking, and accordingly set out clearly for each of them the objectives they are expected to achieve.   This applies both to thoseactivities for which we see no prospect of denationalisation and those where we envisage the introduction of private capital-, whether or not asa step towards complete disposal.AQpJl^SJjabilijy to and Control by^ ministers.     The Sub-Committee agrees generally with the requirements for a new relationship between Ministers and the undertakings set out by theOfficial Sub-Committee in chapter 3A, paragraph 7 of their report (see the extract appended).   The most important of these are the clarification ofthe purposes of control, the setting of predetermined and unambiguousobjectives (including targets on profitability and the efficient use of resources), the confining of short-term pressures by Ministers tooccasions when overriding reasons of national policy demand them and theprovision of better information to enable Ministers to exercise their responsibilities and judge performance.   We recognise that theseproposals will mean a considerable change in the attitude of ministers to the nationalised industries, and that, individually, some of them will be difficult to achieve.   We foresee particular difficulty in1
deciding when short-term intervention on grounds of, for example,wages or prices or regional policy is justified;   in defining the safeguards for the restriction of monopoly;    and in identifying thesocial obligations that should be met.    Where services that have tobe provided for social reasons are demonstrably and inevitably uneconomicwe consider that there should be a clear statement of the requirement and provision of grant-in-aid.     This method avoids any subsequent disputeabout performance and is not incompatible with the introduction ofprivate capital.6.     Ministers can only accept these requirements for a new relationshipif they are satisfied that the undertakings themselves are efficientlyrun.     This requires in turn improved management accounting systems,better strategic information on the industries, and arrangements for holding the Boards&apos; more sharply to account for performance.    TheOfficial Sub-Committee&apos;s proposals in paragraph 8 of chapter 3A (alsoappended) seek these primarily through the annual review of comprehensivecorporate plans and operating budgets produced by the Boards, permittingoversight of their strategic decisions, including their pricing policies,and the fixing of long-term objectives for the Boards, includingindividual profit targets.     Estimates of and control over borrowingare an integral part of the proposals and quarterly reports of progressagainst budget are envisaged.7.     The Sub-Committee agrees generally with the Official Sub-Committee&apos;sproposals, subject to the inclusion of a requirement to re-define atthe outset the Boards&apos; functions and duties, which will requirere-examination of the statutory position in each case.     It will be some years before the new system of control can become fully effective,since some Boards have not yet started to introduce corporate planning and none yet has a refined system in operation.     The control system canbe supplemented by ad hoc enquiries into the performance or organisationof individual industries as and when these prove necessary;   the needfor such enquiries should be infrequent and we do not favour the settingup of any special arrangements for regular efficiency audits or otherenquiries.Accountability of Ministers to Parliament8.     The sort of new relationship between Ministers and the Boards whichis envisaged implies changes in the G-overnment&apos; s relationship withParliament.     Ministers will not be in a position to answer questions ona wide range of more detailed issues such as regional and local matters,short-term problems, specific supply problems and details of costs(although the overall regional responsibilities of Ministers will, ofcourse, remain.)     But the new type of annual reviews will giveParliament, through Ministers, better information on the strategicissues, which should be their main concern;    and we suggest that,although there is no reason why the industries should be required to publish their corporate plans in detail, their long-term objectivesshould be published in their annual reports, together with informativesections on the corporate plans and progress against objectives.2
These could then be debated.     These arrangements should providethe sort of information that would encourage the Select Committeeon Nationalised Industries, or the Select Committee on Expenditure,to focus their attention on the major issues, but including thecorporate plans, which they could not be expected to ignore.Conduct of Ancillar^Activities9o     The Sub-Committee endorse the Official Sub-Committee^ proposalsboth for the conduct of ancillary activities remaining in full public ownership (paragraph 6 of chapter 4) and for the conduct of jointventures (paragraph 3)(see extracts annexed.)     We suggest that therewill be occasions when it will be necessary or desirable for theGovernment to provide further capital in participation with the privatesectcr.    But, in order to ensure that the restraint which we recommendon advances from the National Loans Fund is not evaded, we suggest thatall such applications be subject to the approval of Ministers,collectively through systematic and fully understood procedures.(MVM)Treasury ChambersGreat George StreetLondon SW1May 19713
APPENDIXACCOgjTABILITY-. AND CONTROL OF NATIONALISED industries the Relationship between Ministers and Boards (Mainline Activities)The requirements of a new system7.     The Official Committee consider that in order to reduce thepresent confusion about the extent to which Boards are accountable to Ministers, s. new system of relations between them should seek to:-a. clarify the purposes for which Ministers need to exercise control, and the occasions on which it is proper for them todo so, both to protect the national resources entrusted toBoards ana to ensure consistency of Board policy with the widernational interest;b. ensure that Boards are accountable to Ministers for the performance and general conduct of their industries, againstpredetermined and unambiguous objectives including the achievement of an agreed level of profitability and an overallefficiency in their use of resources;c. provide a spur to efficiency in place of the private sectordisciplines which cannot wholly apply in the nationalised industries;d. confine short term pressures by Ministers   to occasionswhere it is recognised that changes are required for overridingreasons of national policy (eg. at the present time for wages policy);e. clarify the position of the Boards with respect to their responsibility for day to day management;f. facilitate a situation where Ministers can reach betterinformed judgments about the capacity of Board members;g. ensure that Ministers have, in good time and in systematicform, all the information they need to fulfil these responsibilities.The recommended system8. The Committee suggest the following arrangement which would meetgenerally the requirements set out in the previous sector:-i.     The production by Boards of comprehensive corporate plans(which would be reviewed annually and would include the presenttype of annual investment review material) and of annualoperating budgets.   In particular, the corporate plans would discuss, and cost, the main strategic options open to theBoard, and would quantify the investment implications of each;they would also, of course, discuss wages and prices policy.The plans would include the objectives both financial andtechnical proposed by the Boards.1
ii. A system of Ministerial oversight of the strategicdecisions of industries based on their corporate plans.Whilst Ministers would have to decide whether they were preparedto approve the broad lines of these plans, it would be undesirable for them to commit themselves to agreement with every detail in the plan.   Ministers -would rather use plans asan opportunity for discussing costed strategic options withthe Boards, their implications for investment and financing and once they were satisfied approve annual investment programmeson the usual PESC basis.   The procedure would give Ministers anannual opportunity to appraise the whole basis on which each industry was to operate;    this is the key part of the new system.iii. In the light of the proposals in the corporate plan,settlement of long-term (5 years) objectives for the Boardscovering profit targets and other key features suited to thecircumstances of the particular industry (eg manpower reductions could bulk large for the BSC).   These objectives would &quot;berolled forward annually on the basis of the annual review ofthe corporate plan.   Ministers would also, on the basis of theseagreed longer-term objectives, agree annual plans and targets.So far as possible, where prices are at present subject to ministerial control, they would be dealt with as part of theannual review of the corporate plan, although Ministers would of course need to look into any representations by consumercouncils at the time increases were proposed.   (The official committee hope that eventually it will be possible to publishfairly full statements of Board objectives but this might notbe possible for the time being.)iv. Within the system described in iii. above, which is designed to give greater freedom on altering prices whilstexerting a downward pressure on costs,  estimates of andcontrol over borrowing would be seen as an integral part ofthe arrangement.   Officials will be formulating detailed proposals on the working of these arrangements.v. The provision of regular (at least quarterly) reports of progress against budget, in sufficient detail to enable ministers to assess how far the Boards were being successful in achieving their agreed objectives.vi. A knowh procedure for altering the objectives if circumstances or the intervention of Ministers in the national interest required it.The Conduct of Ancillary ActivitiesActivities remaining in full public ownership6.     The best safeguard against cross-subsidisation and unfair competition is organisation in subsidiary companies in producingnormal commercial accounts, and trading at arms1 length from therest of the undertaking.   There will, however, be cases when theeconomic conduct of non-mainline activities requires closeintegration with the main activity.   As a minimum in such cases,we propose:-2
a. The provision and publication of activity accounts.b. A public statement of the principles on which the board would cost and transfer goods to and from the main activity.c. A requirement - unless there were convincing reasons tothe contrary - that the activity should show a &quot;normal&apos;return on the capital invested (or a &quot;normal&apos; return onturnover when this provides a better yardstick).7.    In all cases of non-mainline activities remaining in fullpublic ownership, there should be Ministerial approval to changesin the nature of the activity and to additional investment in it;and the present PESC controls over investment should be retained.Joint ventures3.     Our proposals for activities which it is intended should infuture be conducted through joint ventures are as follows:-a. All activities into which it is intended to introduceprivate capital to be constituted as registered limited liability companies, dealing at arms&apos;length -with the rest ofthe undertaking.b. The companies to have a capital structure that will facilitate the introduction of private capital.c. Finance for any expansion of the activity normally to beraised on the market or out of retained earnings (if a marginremains after a payment of a reasonable dividend on the capital invested); if, exceptionally, new funds are advanced from the parent board they should be on the terms that a private sectorcompany could expect to obtain finance, ie no preferential rate.d. Ministerial control to be limited to control over any newpublic money going into the activity;   the need for Ministerialconsent to the Boards guaranteeing any loans to a subsidiaryand thus pledging the credit of the State;   and power torequire disposals of Boards&apos; interests.e. Accountability to Ministers to be by the Board, not thecompany, and to centre upon a satisfactory financial return on the public money invested.3
British Railways(i)     Shipping Services(net assets  34 million)(ii)   Hotels(net assets  12 million)(iii) Property1CANDIDATES FOR DENATIONALISATIONI   Cases for consultation with the Boards concernedNational Freight Corporation EPC sees no reason in principle for(net assets  120 million) retaining the mainline activities ofthe Corporation (general road haulageand parcels) in the public sector.There are dangers in sale of theprofitable subsidiaries, leaving asubstantial unprofitable and unsaleablerump.     A new Chairman has been appointed-ted with a remit to make the Corporationprofitable, with a view to disengagementby the public sector in the longer term(major disengagement would require legislation).     But continuous pressureis needed to secure the early rational-isation of the heavy loss-making parcelsactivities.     And there should be scope for the early introduction of privateoapital in some subsidiaries,eg Pickfords.The Railways Board regard the shipping services as an essential extension oftheir railway services.     The Ministerfor Transport Industries is making a study of the degree of integration toestablish the extent to which this argument is valid.     There may well bescope for joint ventures if not outrightsale (for which legislation wouldprobably be needed, since the board would be reluctant).There is no reason in principle why thisactivity should remain in the public sector.     Further development should certainly not be undertaken withrecourse to publio funds.     british transport Hotels should either be soldoutright or converted to a joint venturewith private enterprise, in such a way as not to damage the asset of theexisting good management.Increasing pressure should continue tobe put on BRB to ensure they get thebest return from development of theirsites, particularly at mainline terminalstThe BRB should retain their land, withdevelopment by private enterprise.   Thebest method of achieving this will vary from site to site.
(iv)   Train and Station Catering(v)     Hoveroraft(net assets  2 million)Post Office Data ProcessingNatural GasThe possibility of joint ventures v/ithprivate caterers or contracting out should he examined.There is no reason for this riskyactivity to remain in the public sector?but foreign control would be undesirable,.A suitable buyer or a partnership,preferably under British control, shouldbe sought.The issue is whether the Post office should continue to provide a service foroutside customers, over and above thesale of capacity surplus to their own requirements, in competition with private computer bureaux.   A majority ofEPC believe the Post Office should be tolto give up the activity (which usesassets of about  3 million).   If it is tocontinue it should be on the basis of ajoint venture with private enterprise,without further access to public funds.Subject to the opinion of the Law Officer,it would not be possible without new legislation to direct the Post Office to discontinue this activity.Although the Gas Council&apos;s natural gasactivities should continue (either throughGas Council (Exploration) Limited, or   ,through Hydrocarbons Great Britain Limitec&quot;development should take place only in partnership with private enterprise.II Cases dependent on consultations already under wayNational Coal BoardAncillary Activities(net assets  154 million)Although the NCB already operates in con-junction with private enterprise in some areas, there should be scope either foroutright sale, or, as is more likely to bethe case, for increasing the private sector stake in a number of subsidiaryactivities, such as the coke ovens ( 23m.),processed fuel plants ( 19m.), solidfuel distribution ( 3.6m.) and brickworks( 3.6m.).    The Board have submitted afactual report to the Department ofTrade and Industry, and the review iswell advanced.
Gas and Electricity.   ApplianceRetailing, Contracting and Showrooms(net assets: electricity -  23mgas -        )(in the case of electricity these are theonly significant non-mainline activities.)A decision on their future must await the outcome of current discussions with theindustries on the extent to which theactivities are integral to the businessof the undertakings;   if they are to beretained they should be separatelyaccounted for.   Possibilities may includeorganising them into Companies Aotcompanies and operating showrooms asjoint ventures.     Pull hiving off orjoint ventures might require legislationespecially if the Boards were reluctant.3
