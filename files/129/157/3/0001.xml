PAY SETTLEMENTS AND NEGOTIATIONS IN THE PUBLIC SECTORNote by the Secretary of State for employment. At Cabinet on 8 April (CM(71) 20th Conclusions, Minute 6,Conclusion 2) I was invited to circulate for information a note showingpay increases which had been given or were contemplated in public sectorpay negotiations, as a background for Ministers&apos; consideration of casessuch as the police and probation service, where special circumstances might suggest the need to change existing pay relativities.    information about major settlements since the Election and about current negotiations is attached as an Annex.2. The tables show that the great majority of settlements fall withinthe range 8-12 per cent.    Of those which exceed this range, the settlement for local authority manual workers followed the report of the Scamp inquiry,and led directly to the high settlement for National Health Service ancillary workers.    No settlement notified since the beginning of March 1971 has exceeded 11 per cent.3. The Government has taken some account of factors such asrecruitment needs in deciding what would be an appropriate level of increase in particular cases.    Such factors however have not in generalbeen allowed to set aside the overriding need to ensure a continuingreduction in the general level of settlements and we have insisted thatany increase on productivity grounds should be shown to produce clearfinancial savings,4. In general we have insisted that settlements should not be concludedless than 12 months after the previous one.    In a small number of caseshowever (eg police and pilots) calculation of the increase in terms of anannual rate taking into account the interval since the previous settlement would produce figures higher or lower than those shown.    It is not possibleto produce reliable comparisons across the public sector as a whole of theeffect of settlements on earnings talcing account of the interval betweensettlements.R department of Employment SW122 April 1971CP(71) 53 COPY NO      6023 April 1971CABINET
