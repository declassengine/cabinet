IMMIGRATION policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department, The Ministerial Committee on Immigration and community relations (IC) has recently considered three matters which I should bring to the Cabi%etts notice.a. THE PA TRIAL PROVISIONS IN THE IMMIGRATION bill, IC considered the action which should be taken following theamendment, in Commons Committee, to Clause 2(l)(c) of the ImmigrationBill, which effectively removed the &quot;grandparental concession&quot;.    As theBill stands only Commonwealth citizens with a United Kingdom-born father(as is the present law) or mother (as is now proposed) would be free fromimmigration control.    This will substantially reduce the value of the intended patrial concession to the old Commonwealth, where the Govern-ment&apos;s original proposals were welcomed.    The objection to trying to restore the grandparental provision on Report is that this would give riseto serious political difficulties, and might even put at risk the remainingconcession relating to the children of mothers born in the United Kingdom,IC therefore concluded that we should not seek to restore the grandparentalprovision, but that the decision should not meanwhile be disclosed.b. ADMISSION OF ALIENS FOR employment, In approving my proposals for the Immigration Bill (CM(7l) 1stConclusions, Minute 3), the Cabinet invited the Secretary of State for employment to study possible measures to reduce the employment of aliens.Despite the increase in unemployment here, there has been a significant increase in the employment of aliens in recent years (especially in the hoteland catering industry), and the Secretary of State proposes to apply morerigorously the procedure for establishing that no indigenous local labour is available before issuing any permit for the employment of aliens.    Otherfeatures of the changes approved by IC (summarised at Annex) are:a. No permits for unskilled and semi-skilled men in industry and commerce, apart from hotels and catering,b. No permits for semi-skilled men for non-seasonal jobs inhotels and catering,c. Present intake of 7,000 unskilled male seasonal workers inhotels and catering to be reduced.CP(71) 58 COPY NO 0 U10 May 1971CABINET
4*        Domestically the early announcement of these measures would help to counter criticisms that under the Immigx-ation Bill aliens would farebetter than Commonwealth citizens and would show our concern about theunemployment problem.5. But there are difficulties in relation to the current negotiations onour entry into the European Economic Community (e.c.)0    Like some ofthe other actions we are taking, the restrictions proposed would run counter to e.c. provisions about free movement of labour and in announcing them wewould have to be ready to show how they would be affected by accession tothe e.c..    It is also possible that any early announcement might embarrassour e.c. negotiators.c.    UNITED KINGDOM PASSPORT HOLDERS IN EAST AFRICA (UKPH)6. Talks have been in progress with the Kenya and Uganda governments on the basis of the proposed doubling of the admission quota approved by theCabinet on 26 November (CM(70) 41st Conclusions, Minute 6).    Our HighCommissioner has reported that Vice-President Moi of Kenya - thereponsible Minister - will give a personal assurance that our basicrequirements (on non-prosecution of UKPHs waiting in the queue, and thereadmission of queue jumpers) will be met, but there appears to be little chance of getting a formal Kenyan undertaking.    The Amin coup interruption-ted our talks with Uganda but we now hope to reach agreement on a similar basis.    We would like to conclude discussions with the East african governments in time for a Parliamentary announcement later this month.The increased quota would relieve pressure in East Africa and should do much to reduce the bad publicity we suffer at present.    Any public state-ment on the quota shocdd, however, be linked with the announcement of adecision to reduce the flow of other Corrimonwealth immigrants,,TIMING7.        Subject, therefore, to being able to settle the details with the east african Governments, and to e.c. considerations, the right course wouldbe to announce the UKPH decision towards the end of this month and to link with it announcements on the reduced entry of aliens as well as on the reduced Commonwealth entry,RE COMMEND A TION8. I invite the Cabinet:a. to agree that if there is no change in the Parliamentaryposition we should not seek to restore the deleted provision aboutV    grandparents in the Immigration BilJ (paragraph 2);b. to approve the proposed measures to reduce the employmentof aliens (paragraphs 3 and 4);c. to note the arrangements being made with East african governments over UKPHs (paragraph 6); and d. to agree that an announcement should be made about the endof May on UKPHs and on a reduced entry of both alien and commonwealth workers; and to consider the timing.R m home Office SW17 May 19712
CONFIDENTIALANNEXMPL0YM3NT Off ALIENS IN GREAT BRITAIN.The restrictions proposed by the Secretary of State for employment and agreed by the Ministerial Committee on immigration and Community Relations apply mainly to males, since unemployment is a male problem, and are as follows:(a) To tighten up procedures for establishing that noindigenous unemployed labour is available - the &quot;local labour&quot; rule - mainly by requiring more extensive and prolonged notification of vacancies over a wider area.(b) To exclude permits for unskilled and semi-skilled menin industry and commerce (apart from hotels and catering).(c) To exclude completely permits for semi-skilled men fornon-seasonal jobs in hotels and catering.    (Permitsare not issued for unskilled non-seasonal jobs for men.)(d) To impose a quota (which for practical reasons couldnot be effective until next year) to reduce thepresent intake of 7,000 unskilled male seasonal workersin hotels and catering.(e) To confine action as regards women, including residentdomestics in institutions and private households, tothe tightening of the &quot;local labour&quot; rule ((a) above).(f) To apply the above criteria to applications for a changeof joe by aliens, but to make no change in present arrangements for dealing with applications for extensionof stay by aliens so long as they continue in approvedemployment.CONFIDENTIAL
