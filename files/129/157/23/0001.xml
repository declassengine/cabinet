PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY. 1971Introduction1. The public expenditure programmes set outin this report represent the latest costings of the policies which the Government laid down intheir review last year and which were embodied in the White Paper &quot; Public Expenditure 1969-70to 1974-75 &quot; (Cmnd. 4578). Since that white paper was published there have been some changes of policy, such as those announced forthe 1971 uprating of social security benefits, andsome changes of estimates, for example, of thevolume of unemployment benefits, and these changes are taken into account in this report.2. Reviews of policy with implications for public expenditure continue in many fields,major and minor. They include importantspecial studies, such as the review of policy onthe nationalised industries and the special review of the steel industry, commissioned by ministers individually or collectively. they include the Programme Analysis and Review(PAR) Studies for 1971, which are specificallydesigned to improve the basis of expendituredecisions. They also include the reviews of departmental functions about which the PrimeMinister has minuted his colleagues; the studies of the Business Team; and the review of departments&apos; fees and charges. The PARstudies and some of the more important specialstudies were listed in the Annex to CP (71) 43.Where policy decisions have already been taken on these reviews, their expenditure implicationsare reflected in this Survey: this applies, forexample, to the studies of the introduction ofthe new public sector housing policy. Negotia-tion of the terms of entry into the european economic Community (e.c.) continues, and theeffects of entry on public expenditure will depend largely on the terms.3. This Survey provides the base line fromwhich the effects on public expenditure of decisions on these various further issues ofpolicy should be measured. The base fine is the costings of policies as they stand now.4. The costings have been agreed so far aspossible between the Treasury and the spendingDepartments. Where this is not so, the different views are set out in the report. The tabulationsembody the Treasury version of any disputedcosting; and, except where the contrary is stated,references in this report to the &quot; costings&quot; arereferences to the tabulations.5.  This report:(a) outlines  the relationship  of the public expenditure programmes  to  the broadprospect for the economy as a whole(paragraphs 7 to 12);(b) compares the programmes as now costedwith those published in Cmnd. 4578 andexplains the differences (paragraphs 13 to15 and the Annex);(c) outlines the implications of major policy issues which are outstanding at the timeof writing this report (paragraphs 16to 29).(d) states the resulting problem (paragraphs30 to 32).More detailed information is given in theAppendix printed separately from this report.Part 1 analyses each of the individual programmes. Part 2 contains analyses ofexpenditure in various ways cutting across the programmes, covering amongst other aspects,Scotland; Wales; local authorities generally;research and development; and the size and costof the Civil Service. Part 3 provides notes onmethodology, and Part 4 further statisticalanalyses.6. The programmes published in Cmnd. 4578were described in that White Paper (para-graph 7) as &quot; those which the Govern-ment have decided upon for the purposes of managing public expenditure up to 1974-75&quot;,recognising however their greater flexibility thefurther ahead one looks. Ministers areinvited to use this report as the basis for con-sidering, against the background of what theyhave already said publicly in Cmnd. 4578,whether they wish to alter the prospective courseof public expenditure either as a whole or for individual programmes up to 1974-75, and whatthey wish the programmes for 1975-76 to be.Their decisions will be expressed in the pro-grammes to be published in the next of theannual White Papers on public expenditure,which will be due in the late autumn.Public expenditure and the economic prospect7. The costings in this report imply that thetotal of public expenditure would be growingover the period 1970-71 to 1975-76 at anaverage annual rate of 2*1 per cent at constant prices after allowing for the relative price effect.8. In giving a measure of this kind, Cmnd. 4578excluded investment grants. (This was done inorder to avoid appearing to claim too favourablea development from the Governments new policies of restricting the field of public expendi-ture: if the run down of investment grants hadbeen claimed as a reduction of expenditure, itcould have been argued that there should be setalongside it the cost in tax forgone as investment

allowances were introduced.) On this basis,Cmnd. 4578 gave (paragraph 10) the average annual rate of increase in public expenditure over the five years 1969-70 and 1974-75 as-6 per cent. The corresponding rate implied by the costings in this report, excluding invest-ment grants, over the five years from 1970-71to 1975-76 is also 2-6 per cent.9. It was pointed out in Cmnd. 4578 that anannual rate of 2-6 per cent would be rather lessthan the rate of increase in productive potentialin recent years, which has been a little under3 per cent. Mainly because of the raising ofthe school leaving age from September 1972, therate of increase in productive potential is likelyto be depressed for a year or two thereafter, to only a little over 2\ per cent, and although itwould be reasonable to expect a recovery after that, the rate is not likely to rise much, if at all,over 3 per cent by 1975-76.10. An average annual rate of increase in totalexpenditure of 2-6 per cent compared with separately of increase in productive potential varying from about 2\ per cent to about 3 per cent isat best only a very broad indicator of the implications of the programmes for the economy.Moreover, the movement of the aggregate of allthe different kinds of transactions that make uppublic expenditure is not necessarily a reliablemeasure of the movement of public sectordemand on resources. That demand is, broadly,the result of transactions involving the public sector in direct purchase of resources employingstaff, purchasing plant and supplies, engaging inconstruction and so on which have a relativelyheavy demand on resources, virtually   for  of expenditure, and other transactions, mainlytransfers, where the resulting demand on resources is reduced by the tax that flows backor by the preference of the recipient to saverather than spend. For purposes of assessingdemand in economic forecasts the Treasury use a set of factors, which are based on close analysisbut involve also a degree of judgement, for con-converting expenditure in the various categories tothe equivalent in terms of direct demand on resources. On this basis the specific programmes in this report (excluding debt interest and the contingency reserve) would imply an average annual rate of growth of public sector demand on resources of about 3-2 per centO) between 1971and 1976.11. As broad confirmation of this calculationTable 7, at the end of this report, shows anannual growth rate of 3-6 per cent for directpurchase of resources (accounting for about twothirds of all public expenditure) compared with aslight fall in transfers (excluding investment grants).12. These broad indicators suggest that the programmes in this report, without any substan-tial additions, would be exerting a sustainedpressure on the nation&apos;s resources over the period.This conclusion provides only provisionalguidance. A more broadly based view depends on analysing the economic problems of allocation of resources in the period, which begins withunprecedented inflation of incomes and prices but with high unemployment, and extends throughwhat may be the first transitional years of entry to the e.c.. These wider issues are beyond thescope of this report.Comparison with Cmnd. 457813. The costings in Cmnd. 4578 and thepresent costings are set out alongside each other,by groups of programmes, in Table 1, expressed at the prices of this Survey.14. Tables 5 and 6 at the end of this reportshow the details of this same comparison by individual programmes. Table 5 shows forCmnd. 4578 and the 1971 Survey respectively theindividual programme totals embodying the allowances for the relative price effect and the adjustment to 1971-72 outturn prices arising in the programmes; Table 6 shows the corres-ponding figures with the relative price effect andrevaluation to 1971-72 outturn prices shownseparately and in aggregate only.15. The Annex to this report sets out the explanations of the changes in the costings,programme by programme, between Cmnd. 4578and the 1971 Survey, distinguishing policy changesfrom estimating changes. The broad picture isas follows:(&apos;) After allowing for the relative price effect: before doing so, the rate would be 2-6 per cent.TABLE 2Increases (4-) or decreases (-) in costings between Cmnd. 4S78 and the 1971 Survey  million at 1971 Survey prices	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75Policy changes     .      .      .

Apart from issues of policy which will indue course be raised by the various continuingreviews referred to in paragraph 2 above, thereare a number of issues outstanding with implications-tions for public expenditure which Were notreflected in the specific programmes of Cmnd.4578. These are set out in the following paragraphs.a.   Refinancing of fixed-rate credits for exports and shipbuilding17. For a number of years there have beenarrangements under which the commercial banksprovide credits both for exports generally andfor home sales of ships at a fixed rate of interest.There are limits negotiated with the banks on theextent to which they are required to put up finance for these schemes, and beyond these limits the banks have been enabled to call on the IssueDepartment of the Bank of England to refinancetheir loans under the scheme. The outlays of theIssue Department enter into the central Govern-ment borrowing requirement. While the amountswere small this was reflected in the public sectoraccounts by netting them against miscellaneousreceipts. This accounting treatment has con-tinued while the amounts have grown sharply,and what was defensible originally on de minimisgrounds would not be easy to justify now. Buta change, to show the outlays as expenditure, mustbe made in any case since the schemes areoutrunning the resources available for the purpose to the Issue Department and some new arrange-ment will be required for a public account to takeover their role, using moneys which could then only come from votes.18. The total outlays from public funds onthese schemes (which started in 1969-70 at 48 million) are now estimated at up to thefollowing amounts at constant 1971-72 prices:  million1971-72      1972-73      1973-74      1974-75      1975-76Export credits......Shipbuilding credits      .      .      .      .      \Less: increase in bank lending without refinancingTotal.....400 400 440 460 480120 110 90 80 70-155 -120 - 60 -60 -60365 390 470 480 490SECRET121770
These figures are subject to a wide margin of error which cannot be quantified. They assumed high proportion of engineering exports in thetotal for which fixed-rate credit is claimed; theamounts would be less if this proportion hasbeen over-estimated. Similarly the shipbuildingfigures assume that credit will continue to beavailable on terms which match the credit facilities which United Kingdom shipbuilders can obtain in overseas yards. Consideration is being given to possible means of limiting the scopeof the schemes more closely in future.19. If the amounts given in paragraph 18 areadded to the public expenditure programmesshown in Table 1 the effect is to raise the average annual rate of increase in total public expenditure, at constant prices and after allowing for the relative price effect, between 1971-72 and1975-76 to 2-8 per cent. But in public presentation it would be in line with the treatmentof investment grants in Cmnd. 4578 not to includethem in calculations of the rate of increase in public expenditure: in the case of investment grants, expenditure was exchanged for reducedreceipts, and in this case reduced receipts areexchanged for expenditure. Moreover, there isno more substance to the change in this case thanthe replacement of presentation on a net basis inthe public sector accounts by presentation on a gross basis and this reflects no difference in demand on resources or in implications fortaxation.b.   Additional capital expenditure by the british steel Corporation20. The programme of capital expenditure of theBritish Steel Corporation given in Table 9 of appendix Part 1 at 1971 Survey prices repeatsthe Cmnd. 4578 provision for replacing andmodernising plant and expanding capacity. TheCorporation, however, have proposed additional capital expenditure as follows:  million at 1971 Survey prices1971-72       1972-73       1973-74       1974-75       1975-76Fixed assets in United Kingdom and trade investments     .        61 102 134 187 204Overseas investment.......        27 53 80 80 74Increase over Cmnd. 4578   ....        88 155 214 267 278Decisions on these proposals will depend on the outcome of the review of the Corporation^financial position and development plans, whichis due to be completed in the autumn.c.  Entry into European Economic Community21.  Any figures of the public expenditure effects of e.c. entry in 1973-7&apos;4 \1975-76 can only bevery   tentative.    In   particular,   the   UnitedKingdom&apos;s   contribution   to   the   community budget is still under negotiation in Brussels. a formula for determining our contribution has beenestablished, but there has been no discussion yetof the (dimimshing) percentage rebates which weshould be allowed for a transitional period after our accession. The figures in line A below are based, for illustration, on an initial percentagerebate of 50 per cent; the figures in square brackets show the result of an initial rebate of70 per cent.  million at 1971 Survey prices1973-74        1974-75        1975-76A. Contribution to the e.c. Budget (net after taking into account estimatedreceipts)............125 [70]        140 [95]        160 [130]B. Contributions to the European Investment Bank and European Coal andSteel Industry.............25 25 15Total    ...........150 [95] 165 [120]       175 [145]No account has been taken in the figures of possible Exchequer savings through a reductionin direct grants to agriculture; there may be some in the period concerned, but any figure would beguesswork. Nor has anything been included fora United Kingdom contribution to the EuropeanDevelopment Fund (from 1975 onwards).
d. Rolls Royce22. Provision has been included in the programmes in this report for the continuation ofthe RB-211 project. The provisional outturn for1970-71 also includes the downpayment of 30 million towards the cost of purchasing theold company&apos;s assets. There will be expenditureon the balance of the purchase price of the assets, but no estimate can be given since thisis subject to the outcome of negotiations (itwill not represent a demand on resources). Thenew company will also require working capital.No estimate of the full requirement can be madeat this stage. An advance of  20 million madeon 24 May 1971 for this purpose is not reflected in programme estimates. No provision has beenmade for any new Rolls Royce (1971) projects which the Government may decide to support.e. British Petroleum23. The Government holds 48-6 per cent of the equity capital of BP. The company are planning a rights issue, the timing of which is stillundecided; the amounts involved for theGovernment^ subscription would be as follows:  million at 1971 Survey prices1971-72251972-7325/.  Resiting of the military establishment atShoeburyness24. This establishment must be moved as a preliminary to the development of the third london Airport at Foulness. It has been announced that the cost of replacing theShoeburyness facilities will not be a charge tothe Defence Budget. The cost is likely to beof the order of  25 million to  40 million, but no precise estimates can be given until a firmdecision is taken on the future location of thefacilities (this is under examination by theMinistry of Defence). Also, it is not possible to forecast the timing of the expenditure; but onthe assumption that the first runway at Foulnessis in operation in 1980, a substantial part of the costs is likely to be incurred within the survey period.g. Differences between Treasury costings and departments&apos; costings of existing policies25. Part 1 of the Appendix to this reportrecords the following main points of differencebetween the views of the Treasury andof Departments on interpretation of the implications-tions of existing policies or of notice thatadditions to programmes may be proposed.i. Defence    Budget    (Appendix    Part    1,section 1)Ministry of Defence claim for a higherceiling than that proposed by the Treasury:  million at 1971 Survey prices1975-764- 105ii. Overseas    Aid    (Appendix    Part    1,section 3)Overseas Development Administration^claim for a larger increase than theTreasury&apos;s proposal:  million at 1971 Survey prices1975-76+ 22iii. Education (Appendix Part 1, section 19)Net addition proposed by the Departmentof Education and Science (after proposeduse of savings from university building) for replacement and improvement of oldschools:  million at 1971 Survey prices1973-74     1974-75     1975-76- H- 48 -Additional expenditure for this is alsoclaimed for Scotland and Wales.iv. Health   and   personal   social   services(Appendix Part 1, section 20)The Departments concerned take the viewthat Cmnd. 4578 made inadequate provisionfor their services; but they have not proposed quantified additions.v. Social security (Appendix Part 1, section 21)The Department of Health and social security consider that their programme will need to be expanded to provide for a variety of improvements in family support, social security benefits, and for uprating supple-mentary benefits in the years (1972 and1974) between general upratings of social security benefits. The Department havenot proposed any particular amounts ofadditional expenditure.h.   Other developments of policy26.   There are reviews in hand which may result in proposals for additional expenditure,but how much this would be and when it wouldSECRET121770b* 2
be incurred it is too early to say. these include:i. Regional Policy. A report has been corn-missioned from the Official Committee on regional Policy, for consideration by ministers alongside this one.ii. The Environment. The Secretary of Statefor the Environment and his Ministerialcolleagues have instituted a review ofpolicy to bring about a substantial redirec-tion of the effort of the Department of the environment towards measures for improv-ing the environment. This, however, maybe more relevant to the 1972 Survey than to the present one.27. The various potential additions to the programmes which are outlined in paragraphs 17to 25 above would, if accepted withoutreduction of the Contingency Reserve, alter theaverage annual rates of increase over the years from 1971-72 to 1975-76 after allowing for therelative price effect, as shown in Table 3.TABLE 3Average annual rates of increase, after allowing for the relative price effect, between 1971-72 and 1975-76Total Netpublic expenditureexpenditure1 on resourcesA. 1971 Survey       .      .      . . .   ...     .      ....... 2-7 3-6B.

As a measure of the impact of unquantifiedpotential additions to the programmes (such asthose for Rolls Royce other than on the RB-211 see paragraph 22 and those of the Depart-ment of Health and Social Security referred toin paragraph 25 iv. and v.), each addition raising the level of total public expenditure at constant1971-72 prices in 1975-76 by  100 million morethan in 1971-72 would add about 0-1 per cent to the average annual rate of increase in total public expenditure over that period.Cmnd. 4234, over the nearest comparable spanof years for which information was publishedwere as follows:Direct purchaseof resources1969-70 and 1971-724-6 per cent1970-71 and 1972-733 - 3 per cent the problem before Ministers in relation toCmnd. 457830. To the extent that Ministers are concernedwith presenting programmes which will be reasonably consistent with Cmnd. 4578, broadereconomic and other considerations apart, itwould not be strictly necessary to seek to absorbwithin the Cmnd. 4578 totals either the cost ofrefinancing credits for exports and shipbuilding(paragraphs 17-18) since this item is broughtinto the presentation merely as a matter ofTotalpublic expenditure1969-70 and 1973-743-4 per cent1970-71 and 1974-752 - 6 per cent
reclassification (paragraph 19); or the directpublic expenditure cost of entry into theEuropean Economic Community, since it was explained in paragraph 6 of Cmnd. 4578 thatthe figures in that White Paper did not take account of potential future United Kingdom con-tributions to or receipts from the Community.31. On the basis described in the preceding paragraph, the total of identified and costedexpenditure proposals in this Survey (that is,making no allowance for the unqualified itemsfor Rolls Royce, the Shoeburyness militaryestablishment, and for the propositions of theDepartment of Health and Social Security men-tioned in paragraph 25 iv and v) would compare with the Cmnd. 4578 programmes as shown inTable 4.32. The problem is how far, and how, toprevent or offset the excesses over the Cmnd. 4578programmes shown in line 11 of Table 4, whilepreserving a realistic contingency reserve forneeds which may emerge in the five years ahead.TABLE 4Comparison of 1971 Survey including proposed expenditures with Cmnd. 4578 revalued: 1970-71 to 1975-76   millionAverage annualpercentage1970-71    1971-72    1972-73    1973-74    1974-75    1975-76 increase1971-72 to1975-76fAt 1971 Survey prices								Cmnd. 4578								1.

Notes:(a) Agriculture, fisheries and forestry. Policy changes include the 1971 Agricultural Price Review which adds 47 to the forecasts for 1971-72 and subsequent years, and the savings announced in the White Paper on the work of MAFF (Cmnd. 4564) whichwere estimated to reach 15 in 1974-75.The estimating change in 1970-71 reflects revised estimates of agricultural support, allowing for the adjustments in guaranteed prices in October 1970.  The reductions in subsequent years represent mainly revised forecasts of grants and subsidies payments.(b) Research Councils, etc.  Policy reductions of 1 and 3 in the last two years.(c) Investment grants.   The policy increase in 1970-71 and decrease in 1971-72 reflect the acceleration of payments in 1970-71.(d) Other trade, industry and employment. Policy changes include 30 in 1970-71 to Rolls-Royce (1971), Ltd., an extra 96 and62 in 1971-72 and 1972-73 respectively for the RB 211 engine, expenditure growing to 8 in 1974-75 resulting from the Februaryannouncement of revised boundaries for the assisted areas, and expenditure of 6 in the later years on mining incentives.Estimating changes include increases of 14 and 40 in 1973-74 and 1974-75 on Concorde.(e) Nationalised industries.  The policy change figure reflects the speeding up of power station conversion to oil or gas burning.The major estimating changes include a reduction of 23 in 1973-74 and 125 in 1974-75 on capital expenditure by the electricity council and Boards as a result of a revised assessment of future demand; an increase of 15 in 1972-73 (7 in 1973-74) onrephasing and recosting of a power station for the Scottish Electricity Boards; decreases of about 25 in each year from 1971-72to 1973-74 and an increase of 12 in 1974-75 on Post Office investment as a result of a revised estimate of traffic, and delays in supply of equipment. BOAC show net reductions of 15 in 1972-73 and 43 in 1973-74, due to a reassessment of aircraft requirements and rephasing of expenditure on Concorde; BEA also show reduced expenditure of 11 in 1971-72 and 14 in 1974-75mainly due to rephasing of expenditure on the airbus. A number of smaller variations, mainly downward appear on the programmes of the other industries.The shortfall allowance for 1970-71 in Cmnd. 4578 in fact overcompensated for underspending by the industries. Shortfallhas been reduced by 75 in 1971-72, 25 in 1972-73 and 50 in each of the later years.(/&apos;) Roads.  The figures for the earlier years reflect the bringing forward of work into 1970-71 as a result of favourable weather.(g) Housing.   The policy changes represent mortgage lending.Among the estimating changes expenditure on improvement grants has been increased by 18 in 1971-72 rising to 28 in 1974-75as a result of an increase in grant approvals. Housing investment has been reduced by about 40 in 1970-71, 85 in the next two years, and 55 and 50 in 1973-74 and 1974-75. The subsidy figures have been increased by over 140 in 1972-73 and about90 in the later years, following recalculations which reflect the transfer of savings on supplementary benefits to the social securityprogramme.(h) Miscellaneous local services. The policy change reflects agreement to a scheme for immediate raising of the Thames riverwalls.(0 Arts.  An expanded building programme is reflected in the policy change figure.0) Education. The policy change represents the cost in the later years of the increase in the improvement factor for non-teachingcosts from 2i per cent to 3 per cent.(k) Social security. The main policy change is the decision to advance to 20 September and to increase the size of the 1971general uprating. This has increased expenditure by 141, 173, 95 and 18 in 1971-72 and the years thereafter. Other changesinclude the modification of the proposed conditions governing the payment of unemployment benefit to occupational pensioners and to suspended workers, and the various new measures in the Social Security Bill. The net effect of the minorchanges is to reduce expenditure.The estimating changes arise from the transfer of supplementary benefit savings from Housing, and from the method of the revaluation of Cmnd. 4578 figures.(0 Financial administration.  Policy increase represents cost of staff for VAT.(m) Common services. Policy increase of about 3 a year on accommodation for VAT staff is more than offset by thereduction following the decision to suspend work on the Inland Revenue computer centres.Estimating increases arise particularly on accommodation, including accommodation for increased numbers of civil servants,and on Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office expenditure on purchases of computers.(n) Miscellaneous services. Policy savings and receipts are expected to arise on the sale of State Management District activities,(o) Northern Ireland.  The policy savings result from the new arrangements for industrial incentives.Under estimating changes there is an additional 5 for items previously unreported; the other differences are still under discussion.

APPENDIXPART ONEDETAILED ANALYSIS OF programmes.  Defence BudgetTABLE 1  million at 1971 Survey prices	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	outturn	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate		outturn						.     2,604-0	2,598-9	2,533-7	2,496-0	2,530-0	2,547-0	2,565-01. The 1971-72 figure is the total of the current year&apos;s Defence Budget estimates (less thereduction in SET), and is  1 million below the comparable figure in Cmnd. 4578.2. The figures for 1972-73, 1973-74 and1974-75 are those published in the SupplementaryStatement on Defence Policy of October 1970(Cmnd. 4521), revalued to 1971 Survey prices.3. The figure for 1975-76 reflects the Treasuryview that the increase in defence expenditure (at constant prices) between 1974-75 and 1975-76( 18 million or 0-7 per cent) should be of thesame order as that between 1973-74 and 1974-75.4. The Ministry of Defence are unable to accepta figure which is based on a projection of ashort-term trend and which would lead to afurther fall in the defence share of GNP. Theyconsider that a falling share of GNP wouldrequire further reductions in defence capabilities.Defence costs tend to rise faster than the rateof growth of the economy because of the ever-increasing complexity and therefore cost of successive generations of defence equipment. Intheir view the figure should be  2,670 million( 123 million or 4-8 per cent more than in theprevious year). This is itself some  26 million less than the figure in the 1971 long-term costing of the defence programme which reflects thelatest estimate of the programme for that year,taking account of the decisions announced in cmnd. 4521.2.

a. Military aid. This heading covers military technical assist-ance which provides for courses in the UnitedKingdom for the service personnel of othercountries, the provision of British service trainingteams on loan or secondment to developing(mainly Commonwealth) countries and a small amount of police training, particularly in South-East Asia. It also covers the cost of capital equipment to a few countries although this typeof expenditure is being run down. The provisionfor Special Defence Aid for Singapore and malaysia has been transferred to this programmefrom Overseas Aid. The figures from 1972-73onwards may need minor upward adjustmentdepending on decisions about assistance to security forces in the Persian Gulf. No forecastcan yet be made of the expenditure consequences of any possible settlement of outstandingproblems with Libya.b. Allied services . Under this heading the main items areaccommodation for Ministry of Defence head-quarters staff, superannuation for civilian staff and HMSO and COI services (stationery and recruitment publicity).c. United States military aircraft. The purchasing programme for the Phantomand Hercules aircraft and associated equipment,which is covered by United States credits, isalmost at an end. The Military Aircraft (Loans)Act 1966 which allows credit to be drawn forthe purchase of these aircraft and equipmentexpires on 31 March 1972 and the estimate for1971-72 therefore covers the balance of creditavailable. Under the terms of the loan agree-ments repayments of the capital and payments of interest continue throughout the period.4. The treatment of the payments in respect ofthese aircraft is as follows:(i) Progress payments in respect of the pur-chase and associated research anddevelopment costs are included in linec(i); they constitute the public expendi-ture cost as defined in the national accounts. The United States credits fromwhich they are financed are treated asreceipts in the national accounts.(ii) Repayments of the credits are charged to the Defence Budget when they occur;but since to include both these and theprogress payments in the total of public expenditure would involve double count-ing, the former are offset by equal butnegative entries in line c(ii). Similarlypayments of interest on the credits whichare charged to the Defence Budget andare also included in the overall total of debt interest, are offset by a negativeentry in line c (ii).3.

1. Overseas aid expenditure covers all UnitedKingdom official development assistance to developing countries and international organisa-tions. Special defence aid for Singapore and malaysia which has hitherto been shown as anadditional item is now fully distinguishable fromthe economic element of that special aid and hasbeen transferred to &quot; Other military defence military aid&quot;, so that the total of government expenditure above is also the total economic aid programme all of which, on a net basis, countstowards the UNCTAD 1 per cent target.2. The figures above are in current prices, gross(without deducting amortisation) in accordancewith the practice of controlling and announcing the overseas aid programme on this basis. Otherinvestment by the Commonwealth development corporation (CDC) in line d. is now shown grossinstead of net, so that the public aid expenditure total for overseas aid is consistently gross. Inthe summary Tables in the main Report, how-ever, the overseas aid totals are shown in 1971constant prices, net of amortisation, derived fromthe cash figures, for consistency and compar-ability in the overall presentation; and thesefigures are reproduced in line f. above for easeof reference.3. These changes in the presentation of specialdefence aid for Singapore and Malaysia and ofCDC investment affect comparison with theprevious totals published in Part 2 of Cmnd.4578; the determining figure for this category is however the economic aid programme in line c.which is unaffected, and may be directly corn-pared with the corresponding previous figures.Years up to 1974-754. The aid programme totals to 1974-75 above are those announced in Cmnd. 4515. They were approved by Ministers last October oh the basis that the figures for 1973-74 and 1974-75 shouldbe examined in 1972-73 and against the back-ground that the Prime Minister would announceto the United Nations the United Kingdom&apos;intention to do its best to reach by 1975 the target of 1 per cent of GNP for total (official and private) flows to developing countries,making it clear that a substantial percentage ofthis was expected to come from private flowsand that these in turn depended on the attitude to private investment of receiving countries. (Theprivate flows counting towards the target includenet guaranteed export credits and voluntary con-tributions as well as net private investment.) an examination was then commissioned into ways of stimulating private investment in developing countries, and certain recommendations to thisend have now been approved by Ministers, and announced in Cmnd. 4656.1975-765. There is disagreement on the total aid pro-gramme for 1975-76; against the Treasury pro-posal of  375 million gross set out above, the overseas Development Administration (ODA)have proposed  400 million gross. The keyfigures for comparing the two proposals are shown in the following table:  million1971-721972-731973-741974-751975-76Treasury       ODACurrent PricesGross aidPercentage increaseNet aid       ...Percentage increasePercentage of GNP forecastConstant 1971 PricesNet aid       .      .      .Percentage increase2452142653003403754007	8	13	13	10-0	17-5	232	263	298	329	3547 0-38	8 0-39	13 0-41	13 0-43	10-5 0-44	18-8 0-472142232432652813036-014-0Treasury proposal6. The Treasury proposal of  375 million for1975-76 ( 281 million net 1971 constant prices)is designed as a fair interpretation of existing policies, which in the Treasury view call for somecontinuing expansion of the aid programme inthe final year of this Survey period, with the nettotal representing no smaller percentage of GNPthan in the previous year. The Treasury doesnot consider that existing policies necessarily call for continuing the same high rate of increaseapproved last year for the final years of the1970 Survey period (13 per cent gross current prices, 9 per cent net constant prices). The figure
fproposed above represents a 10 per cent increasegross and in current prices over 1974-75, basedon the average increase in each of the 4 years1971-72 to 1974-75; and an increase in constant1971 prices, net, of 6 per cent. It also represents an increase over 1974-75 in the percentage of gnp of the net programme, on present forecasts,from 0-43 per cent to 0-44 per cent.ODA proposal7. The ODA while not seeking to anticipate the outcome of the 1972-73 examination believe that existing policies require that the official aid pro-gramme now projected for the target year (1975)of the United Kingdom&apos;s 1 per cent &quot; best endeavours&quot; undertaking should represent no reduction in the rate of increase in previous years but rather a reasonable continuance of the growthapproved to 1974-75 by Ministers with thatundertaking very much in mind, so as to reach a platform on which they might, if they thoughtit right, decide later to build some further expansion of the aid programme.8. Revision of GNP forecast since last Septem-ber has already resulted in eroding the expectedpercentage of GNP in official aid in 1974-75 from-44 to 0-43; and, as the ODA do not wishto suggest revision of the 1974-75 figures beforethe review due in 1972-73, they propose a some-what greater increase in the programme in1975-76 than for the previous two years to com-compensate for this effect and to make more crediblethe Government^ intentions with regard to the1 per cent target. Their proposal of  400 million in gross cash terms ( 303-6 million net at 1971constant prices) would represent, on present GNPforecasts, 0-47 per cent of GNP for net aid in1975-76; but they believe that experience sug-gests that the erosion will continue and that inthe event it would represent a smaller percentage.Their proposal is thus intended to maintain the momentum of increase in the aid programme and also to provide a margin of protection againstthe risk of some further inflationary increase inthe GNP.Treasury comments9. The Treasury believe that the increased rateof growth proposed by ODA for official aid in1975-76 is considerably more than is justified,certainly at this stage; it would be premature toprovide for so much, given that Ministers intendthat a substantial contribution to the 1 per centshould come from private sources and that newincentives to private investment are being devised,which need time to show their effect.4.

The expenditure on Other overseas servicesshows no significant change from 1971-72,although it includes allowance for some reduc-tions in the size of the Diplomatic Service. Theexpenditure is directed to the promotion ofBritish interests overseas. Part of it is governeddirectly by international commitments.a.  Overseas representation2. This expenditure comprises the cost of theForeign and Commonwealth Office (includingthe Overseas Development Administration andPassport Offices in London and other centres)and of the Diplomatic Service and its accom-modation and associated expenses in representingBritish interests internationally.b.  Overseas information. The figures for 1971-72 to 1974-75represent expenditure limit totals agreed by ministers in their consideration of the 1970Survey, pending the outcome of relevant reviewsbeing undertaken as part of the wider examina-tion of Government activities. It has also beenagreed that if a decision was taken not toproceed with a BBC relay station project in
South-East England, a total of  0-6 million(mainly in 1972-73, 1973-74 and 1974-75)should be deducted from the above figures. Thetotal for 1971-72 includes an unallocated element of  0-7 million which does not appear in theestimates.4. The figures for 1972-73 to 1975-76 include provision for the modernisation of the Diplo-matic Wireless Service relay station facilities(mainly at Cyprus) and the installation of a newventilation system at Bush House. In theForeign and Commonwealth Office view these projects (total estimated cost  2-4 million and 0-8 million respectively) have a higher prioritythan the construction of the African broadcastingrelay (total estimated cost  3-4 million) pre-viously included in the programme for thisperiod. To that extent, the figures represent thecosting of an &quot; alternative policy &quot;. The figuresfor this period exclude provision for a start onPart 3 of the United Kingdom re-equipment programme for BBC External Services (total estimated cost  5-5 million), which will be sub-ject to decision by Ministers.c.  Other external relations. This item consists mainly of expenditure onthe Secret Service and international commitments and subscriptions, including the UnitedKingdom&apos;s assessed contributions to regularbudgets of United Nations organisations and ofthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment, the Council of Europe and theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (secretariatcosts). While every effort continues to be madeto contain the rate of expansion of such budgets,the forecasts of assessed contributions payableare based on the most realistic assumptionspossible at this stage. Provision continues tobe made for the voluntary support of the united nations Force in Cyprus. There is no overallchange in the level of expenditure forecast in cmnd. 4578.5.

The expenditure covers the implementation of the price guarantees, the provision of grants and subsidies to farmers and the associatedadministrative costs. The cost of implementing the guarantees is liable to marked variationsaccording to the levels of supply and of market prices, and no attempt can be made to forecast the effect on expenditure of changes in the levels of the guarantees and subsidies resulting fromthe determinations made at future Farm PriceReviews.2. The figures for agricultural support do not therefore represent an attempt to predict thefuture course of expenditure but are presentedon much the same conventional basis as in thepast--namely, a projection of the estimates forthe current year adjusted so as to take accountof the full-year effects of this year&apos;s Price Review.In practice, the cost of agricultural support may result in higher or lower expenditure than thefigures in the table, depending on the factorsdescribed above.
3. This year it is particularly difficult to put a figure on the future cost of agricultural support.No attempt has been made to allow for entry into the European Economic Community beforethe end of the quinquennium, but the figuresfor price guarantees a (i) seek to illustrate,on a purely arbitrary basis, the effect of theGovernments intention of introducing a new system of agricultural support based on levyarrangements to replace deficiency payments. a start on introducing these new arrangements is to be made in 1971-72 and the estimates for that year are assumed to include a saving of  25 million from the interim levyschemes. It is, however, impossible to forecastwhat the effect of the changes in support arrangements will be on expenditure in theremaining years of the Survey because this will depend on the nature and extent of the levyschemes in operation at the relevant time. Thebalance of the savings of these years (on top of the  25 million just mentioned) to reach theannounced savings target of  150 million by1974-75 has been arbitrarily set at  25 million in 1972-73;  75 million in 1973-74 and 125 million in 1974-75 and 1975-76.b.  Other assistance to agriculture4. Most of the other expenditure by MAFFand DAFS on agricultural and horticulturalservices is included here. As with agricultural support, some expenditure has been projectedforward on a conventional basis with no detailedforecast of future variations-e.g. stabilisationpayments to the bacon curing industry, animaldisease compensation, and payments made underthe Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.c. Fisheries5. The main expenditure under this headingrelates to subsidies for the fishing industry and grants and loans for new vessels and equipment.Future expenditure on these depends on oper-ating results and on the plans for capital investment which may be made by the industry.Neither can be forecast with accuracy.d. Forestry6. This item includes both state forestry and grants to the private sector. The figures make no provision for a change in policy. they include an estimate of the increasing value ofState-owned forests, taken as equal to the Com-mission&apos;s net cost of forestry operations; thisis included as a measure of the change in thevalue of stocks. This net cost includes corn-pound interest on past grants in aid, as well asthe grant in aid for the year in question. the cash requirement decreases gradually over the quinquennium, but the mean is about 15 million. A review of the Commission^accounts is in progress, and it is hoped that theestimate of the increase in the value of State-owned forests will be on an improved basis infuture years. In addition, a general review offorestry policy is in progress and may result inchanges to the forecast figures.6.

This is a block budget which the Secretary ofState for Education and Science allocates eachyear after receiving the advice of the Council for scientific Policy (CSP). Table 6B shows theallocation for 1971-72 made on the advice of theCSP.2. The expenditure of the Social science research Council has now been included in the science Budget and, subject to the advice of theCSP, is expected to remain around its present level between 1972-73 and 1975-76.3. Since the publication of Cmnd. 4578 theSecretary of State for Education and Science has agreed to reduce the expenditure of the research councils by a further  1 million for 1973-74 and 3 million for 1974-75 at 1970 prices; these reductions are reflected in Table 6A at 1971prices. Future decisions in this field will, ofcourse, have to take account of continuing policy7.

1. Categories I to IV of this block coverexpenditure by the Department of Trade andIndustry, including expenditure on civil aviation and shipping services previously included under&quot;Surface transport&quot;. (Category IV consists ofcivil aerospace expenditure transferred from theMinistry of Aviation Supply; the arrangementsfor programming and presentation of this category of expenditure are at this stage provisional andare to be reviewed before the next Survey.)Category V covers expenditure for which otherDepartments, mainly the Department of Employ-ment, are responsible in the field of industry andemployment.Department of Trade and industry i.  General Support programme . The expenditure in this section coversactivities which by their nature allow some flexibility in financial management from year to year and can therefore be programmed ahead.Ground rules for operating the section on thebasis of an agreed forward allocation are beingworked out between the Department of Tradeand Industry and the Treasury.administration3. This provision excludes expenditure on staffnewly transferred from the Ministry of AviationSupply, which is included under Category IV.below. The reduction in 1972-73 onwards is mainly due to the transfer of staff from this heading to the Civil Aviation Authority.other general support4. This covers expenditure on government research Establishments and those of the atomic energy Authority; grants to Research Associa-tions; the National Research development corporation; support for industrial technologyincluding advisory services, extramural research and development, pre-production order schemesetc. It also contains Civil aviation services (apartfrom local authority expenditure); shipping services (apart from repayment of loans); andPromotion of tourism, exports, etc. (apart fromthe hotel loans and grants scheme). the excluded items mentioned above are allcontained in Category III.5. The forecasts assume the setting up of a civil Aviation Authority on 1 April 1972, butare of necessity provisional. It is intended thatgrants will be made by DTI towards current expenditure over the Survey period, but it ishoped that the continued progress towardsrecovery of costs will result in the Authoritybecoming self-supporting on current account in1977-78.6. Reviews are taking place on the level of individual items within &quot; Other general support&quot;.Department of Trade and IndustryII. Promotion of local employment7. This expenditure covers loans and grants byDTI to firms providing additional employment inthe assisted areas, the development of industrialestates and the provision of factories. the forecasts allow for the extended measures ofassistance to industry under the Local Employ-ment Acts detailed in (a) to (c) of paragraph 14 ofthe White Paper on Investment Incentives (Cmnd.4516). They also take account of the alterationsto the boundaries of the assisted areas announced in the House of Commons on 3 and 18 February.The resulting forecasts, based on latest assess-ments of demand by industry for local employment Acts assistance, are somewhat lower than those contained in Cmnd. 4578 except for1973-74.Department of Trade and IndustryIII. Other expenditure. This covers a number of unprogrammableitems. No provision is contained for new projectsas yet unapproved.investment grants9. The figures reflect the decision to discontinue the investment grants scheme announced in theWhite Paper on Investment Incentives (Cmnd.4516). The forecasts, which are of necessitytentative, provide for residual expenditure undercontracts entered into by industry before27 October 1970. The provision for 1971-72 is considerably lower than the Cmnd. 4578 figurereflecting the decision to accelerate into 1970-71payments which would otherwise have occurred in 1971-72. The forecast expenditure in 1975-76allows for delays in completion of ships contractedfor before 27 October 1970.assistance to the coal industry10. The forecasts, which are below those contained in Cmnd. 4578, reflect the continuedassistance in the Coal Industry Act, 1971. Theyassume the continuation of the present form of the redundant Mineworkers Payments Scheme. TheScheme, for which there is no commitment beyondMarch 1972, is being fundamentally reviewed thisyear and some lower cost alternative may emerge.assistance to the shipbuilding industry11. No provision is made for any assistanceoutside that provided by the shipbuilding industry Board whose statutory life ends on31 December 1971.industrial reorganisation corporation12.

This covers expenditure by the EnglishTourist Board on the hotel loans and grants scheme which related to projects started on or before 31 March 1971 and is not to be extended.The forecasts are greater than those contained in cmnd. 4578 due to a substantial increase in thenumber of applications for grants.loans (net) british nuclear fuels ltd. andradiochemical centre ltd.15. The forecasts for 1971-72 to 1974-75 areoverall almost  12 million less than those contained in Cmnd. 4578 due to a rephasing of requirements. This rephasing produces anincrease of about  7 million on the Cmnd. 4578figure for 1973-74.miscellaneous services and financial trans-actions16. This item contains a number of loan repay-ments, expenditure on atomic energy, mainlyproduction expenditure and receipts, and someother minor items.mining incentives for mineral development17. Provision is made for selective assistance formineral development recently approved by ministers.Department of Trade and IndustryIV.  Civil Aerospaceconcorde18. The Concorde estimates are higher thanthose in Cmnd. 4578 by  14-1 million in 1973-74and  39-7 million in 1974-75. This results froman increase in real terms of  26 million during the survey period in this country&apos;s share of thedevelopment costs and from the assumption thatthe likely date from which the aircraft can flycommercially has slipped by six months to theend of 1974 thereby postponing progress payments from the airlines and increasing the burden onthe Government of financing production in thoseyears. The drop in expenditure in 1975-76assumes that as the aircraft goes into service, and receipts flow in, calls on the Government for production finance will fall away.19. The latest basic estimate of the total joint anglo-French development costs is  885 million(equivalent to  872 million at 1971 Survey prices).There may however be further increases. If, forexample, development costs were to rise to 950 million our share of the increase might be ofthe order of  30 million within the Survey period,with a peak of about  12 million in 1972-73.rolls royce (1971) ltd.20. The estimates include the down payment of 30 million that has been made on the rolls royce assets which are being acquired by theGovernment; but no provision is made for theexpenditure that will arise on the balance of thepurchase price, which is not yet known. no provision is made for working capital which willbe required by the new company, though an advance of  20 million for this purpose wasmade on 24 May 1971, pending determination of the full requirement. The estimates also include the cost of the RB-211 project, assuming that it goes ahead. Provision in Cmnd. 4578for Rolls Royce consisted of approximately 50 million launching aid on the RB-211 in years 1970-71 to 1973-74 offset by receipts of 21 million up to 1974-75 from levies on thesale of other Rolls Royce engines which hadbenefited from Government support.21. &quot; Other civil aerospace &quot; includes adminis-tration costs and some relatively small direct assistance to the industry, e.g loans to Shorts of belfast. But most of the expenditure under this heading is on aviation research and development and the national space programme which, underthe new arrangements, will be carried out bythe procurement organisation of the Ministry ofDefence which will be reimbursed by the Depart-ment of Trade and Industry. Much of thisresearch and development is of joint benefit to defence and civil purposes and, as in previous years, the division of the costs between thedefence and civil budgets has been made inaccordance with conventions agreed in advance.The arrangements for making this division will now be reviewed in the light of the re-organisa-tion of responsibilities.22. There is no provision in these figures forthe cost of new civil aircraft or aeroengineprojects.V.  Department of Employmentemployment services23. Employment services comprise expenditure by the Department of Employment and by localauthorities on services (including the YouthEmployment Service) for which the Departmentmakes grants. The larger items of expenditure are departmental administration (including the
employment exchanges, Government TrainingCentres and the Factory Inspectorate), training and rehabilitation schemes, and services for theseriously disabled.24. The increase over the Survey period is due mainly to further development of the placing,advisory and industrial training services,including the continued expansion of Govern-ment Training Centres to about 15,000 placesby the end of 1975-76, and the implementation of the Industrial Relations Bill. Although theexpansion of Government Training Centres toabout 14,400 places by the end of 1974-75 hasbeen agreed by Ministers, no decision has yetbeen taken on the level of expansion beyond thatdate. Whilst, therefore, the Treasury acceptsthat further expansion in 1975-76 is consistent with the Governments general policy objective,the level of provision which has been included  0-6 million in 1974-75 and  2-3 million in1975-76 is subject to change in the light of the detailed decisions still to be taken.redundancy fund payments25.

This heading includes expenditure by the highlands and Islands Development Board, theScottish and Welsh Tourist Boards, the export credits Guarantee Department and the Develop-ment Fund. It also includes grants to the BritishProductivity Council which, as previouslyannounced, will be phased out from 1971-72.8-12.  Investment by the nationalised ii1. The capital expenditure programmes of the nationalised industries account for about 7 percent of all public expenditure. The programmes are designed to meet the demand from payingcustomers for their products and services in themost efficient way and assume that the industriesconduct their finances so that they meet their financial objectives and/or other statutory obligations.2. Nationalised industries capital expenditure is now expected to continue at much the same level up until 1973-74 but to show an upward trend thereafter.Shortfall3. For nationalised industries as a wholeexperience shows that capital expenditure fallsshort of the approved figure. Last year how-ever this shortfall was smaller than previouslyexperienced. This year industries were told toprepare their programmes on as realistic a basis as possible. It should therefore be recognisedthat expenditure might exceed estimates prepared on this basis and this should entail a readiness to approve some additional expenditure if itarose from agreed policy. An allowance of 100 million in 1971-72,  125 million in 1972-73and  100 million in each of the last three years has been deducted from the aggregate expendi-ture on fixed assets by the individual industries.The   reduced   allowance   for   shortfall   takes account both of the instruction to the industries to provide realistic estimates of expenditure andalso of experience in 1970-71 when aggregateshortfall seems to have been considerably lower than in earlier years.Sale of assets4. No credit has been taken for the potentialproceeds of sale of assets which may be decided on in the light of the recommendations madeby the Official Committee on nationalised industry Policy except in respect of the sale ofTransport Holding Company assets (includingThomas CookS) and the National Freight Cor-poration shipping assets which have been agreed by Ministers. If it is eventually agreed thatassets should be sold, then this would affectfigures for sales of fixed assets in Tables 8-12,and hence reduce the figures for total capitalexpenditure. If, however, it is eventually decidedthat in some or all cases there should be jointventures, with the private sector providing futurecapital required for investment, this would notnecessarily affect the capital expenditure figures.Comparison with previous programmes5. The nationalised industries fixed investment programme in aggregate is below the estimates in Cmnd. 4578 before shortfall. After shortfallthe figure is higher than Cmnd. 4578 in 1971-72and 1972-73, but lower in 1973-74 and 1974-75.

All the programmes in Table 8 are based on demand assumptions for different fuels. Theseare affected by rate of growth of GDP, relativeprices and consumer preferences. individual industries&apos; demand forecasts may reflect someoptimism about market shares but, with somequalifications in the case of coal (see paragraph 5below), they are broadly consistent with theDepartment of Trade and Industry&apos;s own fore-casts of energy requirements in the period up to1976.a.  National Coal board. The industry&apos;s programme includes invest-ment in collieries, ancillaries (e.g. coke ovens),trade undertakings and loans to an off-shore gassubsidiary.3. The NCB have assumed that they will needall the coal they can mine until 1973-74 at theearliest, and their programme is geared to maxi-economising output from existing pits. In order toboost morale they have publicly set themselves a target of 150 million tons a year up to themiddle 1970s. But they do not expect to achieve this and their proposals are in fact geared tooutputs of about 140-145 million tons a year.4. The figure for 1971-72 includes  4-5 million for investment in collieries, and  2 million for investment in opencast production, not allowed for in Cmnd. 4578. There is a real prospect ofcoal shortages this winter, particularly if thereis industrial trouble over the pay claim expected in the autumn; NCB coal stocks are low; sothere is a good case for trying to maximise pro-duction in 1971-72. This involves keeping morecollieries open than previously forecast (with a consequent rise in investment) and a determineddrive to improve productivity, which in the viewof the NCB depends on a belief in the industry that production levels will be maintained.5. The outlook for coal in later years is particu-larly uncertain; and it is possible (in the viewof the Treasury, likely) that the market willrequire less coal than the NCB expect to produce.Departments therefore agree that it would be wrong to base firm estimates of expenditure atthis stage on the NCB&apos;s programme. For1972-73 the NCB have proposed investment of 67 million in coal production. The Departmentof Trade and Industry do not wish to cast publicdoubt on this figure since to do so might worsenmorale in the industry, and accordingly considerthat it should be included in the programme. Butthey suggested that the NCB should be requirednot to commit more than 90 per cent (i.e.,  60million), leaving the remainder for further con-sideration in the autumn of this year. Thefigures in the table, however, are based on theTreasury view that because of the likely declinein demand for coal, and the possibility that coalstocks may be sufficiently large within the next12 months, no adequate case has yet been made out for an increase in the Cmnd. 4578 pro-gramme; and that the figure to be approved for1972-73 should accordingly be based on invest-ment of  60 million in coal production, leaving it open to the DTI to reopen the matter this
autumn should circumstances justify it. Thefigures for 1973-74 and 1974-75 are based on theestimates for investment in collieries and open-cast mining underlying the corresponding figures in Cmnd. 4578; and that for 1975-76 is basedon broadly similar assumptions.6. Departments are agreed that the remainder of the programme is realistic. Investment inancillaries and trade undertakings will be subjectto review under the Coal Industry Act 1971:and investment in the latter has provisionallybeen limited to an arbitrary  1 million a year after 1971-72. The proposals for expenditureon off-shore gas take no account of the pos-sibility that the NCB, with its partners, may be awarded further licences in this year&apos;s round.Such awards would probably lead to bids forfurther expenditure.b.  Electricity Council and Boards (Englandand Wales)7. The necessary level of investment in elec-tricity generating capacity is determined by the forecast level of simultaneous maximum demand(SMD) for the sixth and seventh winters ahead(i.e., when capacity started in year one is planned to come into service): by the margin of capacityjudged necessary to provide for variations in actual from forecast demand, breakdowns, etc.:and by the view taken on whether plant can be built within the period planned. This year&apos;demand forecast by the Electricity Council shows a substantial reduction on last year&apos;s: forecastSMD for the winter of 1976-77 (54,000 MW.) isno higher than what was forecast last year forthe winter of 1975-76. Except for 1972-73 (seeparagraph 11 below), this implies significantlylower expenditure, particularly towards the endof the review period, than the figures given in cmnd. 4578. However, the industry take theview that the planning margin of 17 per cent ofSMD to which they have worked since 1964should be raised to 20 per cent. The 20 percent incorporates the assumption that the delays in construction which are seriously affectingplant being built will have been virtually removed by 1976 (i.e., reduced from about 12,000 MW.to 1,320 MW.) and will not reappear; and that the availability of plant at times of peak demand willbe increased from its recent low figures (about73 per cent) to 88 per cent. (j.e., an improvementin availability of some 10,000 MW.).8. The figures in line 6 of Table 8 give anestimate of the cost of the existing policy ofaiming at a planning margin of 17 per cent. Theestimates proposed by the industry for 1972-73,1973-74, 1974-75 and 1975-76 on the basis ofa 20 per cent planning margin were  427,  427, 441,  523 million respectively. The Departmentof Trade and Industry believe that the CEGBassumptions (set out at the end of paragraph 7)may be over-optimistic and that even with the20 per cent margin, there would be a much higher risk of interruption of supply than hashitherto been allowed for. The Departmenttherefore consider that a programme based on ahigher planning margin should be approved andthat a more realistic costing of an acceptableplanning margin is given in the figures set outin this paragraph. The Department have reached this view after taking account of the possibility that the assumed load forecast may prove too high because of the failure of the economy to grow at the hoped-for rate.9. On the other hand, the Department have notyet been able to assess the realism of the pro-grammes of the Area Boards; although they showsubstantial reductions on the original forecastsmade by Boards last year, and are slightly belowthe provision included in Cmnd. 4578, it ispossible that the figures for these Boards foreach year after 1972-73 might be reduced when this assessment has been made to provide someoffsetting saving.10. Any increase in the planning margin would,as noted in paragraph 8.5 of Part One of theAppendix to the December 1970 Survey, be amatter for the Government to consider, in viewof its substantial long-term consequences for public expenditure. However, it is not necessaryto reach a decision immediately, since whetherthe margin is 17 or 20 per cent the CEGB donot propose to order another power station before1972; a full evaluation of the risks and costsentailed by different margins should be presented to Ministers in due course. The Treasury donot accept that an economic case for a margin of 20 per cent has yet been made out.11. The expenditure levels in Table 8 include provision for converting coal-fired power stations to oil or natural gas, which was excluded fromthe previous Survey. The expense falls mainly in 1972-73 ( 15 million) and is one reason forthe increase in planned expenditure in 1972-73compared with the figure in Cmnd. 4578. Someof these conversions have been formallyapproved since last year&apos;s review, although thebulk of the expenditure relates to conversions notyet individually approved. Conversion is inaccordance with Government policy (CM (70)31st Conclusions, Item 6). If Ministers wishedto reduce expenditure in 1972-73 it would notnecessarily be desirable to concentrate the cutspecifically on conversions; any reductionregarded as essential could be allocated by theindustry and would in practice probably be
shared between conversions, miscellaneous(including safety) measures, and expenditure byArea Boards on the distribution system.c. and d.  Scottish Electricity12. Although they are separate statutory bodiesthe NSHEB and SSEB operate a joint generatingsystem. The Boards have proposed, and depart-ments agree, that the North Board should build a power station to meet demand in and afterthe winter of 1977-78 in NE Scotland. Adecision, however, on the type of station to be built cannot be made until the late autumn, when a Department of Trade and Industry study on future thermal reactors is expected to be com-pleted. It would be a condition of agreement in principle to the proposed station that the boards should reappraise this investment in thelight of the study group&apos;s findings and latesttender information.13. The figures in the Table assume that theNSHEB will build a steam generating heavywater reactor instead of an advanced gas-cooledreactor (AGR) nuclear power station, which is15 per cent cheaper in terms of total capital coststhan the AGR.14. Excluding conversions to oil and natural gas,which are discussed below, and some minorinescapable safety work, the Boards originally proposed the same physical programme as under-lies Cmnd. 4578. The programmes have,however, been reduced after discussion with theScottish Development Department by the deferment of the Boards&apos; long-term generatingplans (at an ultimate additional capital cost of 5-5 million) and a reduction in transmission anddistribution estimates in accordance with theTreasury view that the annual rate of growth ofGDP is likely to be less during the review period than the level assumed by the Boards. If a higher rate of growth should materialise an increase inthe programme is likely to be necessary.15. The Boards&apos; plan to convert a number of power stations to oil or gas firing (costing  1-8, 2-7, and  1-2 million in 1971-72, 1972-73 and1973-74 respectively). Such provision was omitted from the 1970 Survey as Ministers had not agreeda general policy on conversions. To this extent the conversion proposals, like the correspondingEnglish proposals, are additional bids. But the remarks in paragraph 11 apply equally to theEnglish and the Scottish programmes.e.  Gas Council and Boards16. The planning target of the gas industry is by1975 to absorb 4,000 million cubic feet a day(mcfd) of natural gas. Investment remains gearedto this amount, which is within the supplycontracts already entered into. Demand,especially for industrial use, is developing strongly,and investment in the necessary facilities is keptjust ahead of marketing.17. The cost of converting appliances to burnnatural gas (about  370 million over the reviewperiod) is not included in the Table, but is reflected in the industry&apos;s gross trading surpluses.This conversion operation is an essential part ofthe natural gas programme and has beenoptimised both financially and economically usingoperational research and other techniques.18. The industry has reduced further the amountof capital expenditure proposed (the figures in line e in Table 8 are all less than the corres-ponding figures in Cmnd. 4578). There is aslippage in 1971-72 of  20 million in theprogramme approved last year. The industryintends to absorb any effect of this slippage in later years within the figures proposed.19. The Department of Trade and Industryconsider that the possibility of making further cutsin the programme, additional to the large cuts ofa year ago and the reductions now made by theindustry, should be viewed against the desirabilityof this fuel (and the demand for it) in place of imported oil. The Treasury have some reserva-tions on this, as there have been significantchanges in economic and other circumstancessince the absorption target of 4,000 mcfd wasadopted. In any event the Gas Council was askedto assess the effect of imposing reductions ofvarious degrees of severity on the plannedprogramme of expenditure on fixed assets. Majorreductions would have serious implications for thelevel of sales and for the security and safety of gas supplies. A 5 per cent cut (producing about 9 million in each of 1972-73 and 1973-74, 8 million in 1974-75 and  7 million in 1975-76)while less serious, would still be significant.Certainly the Gas Councils advice is that saleswould be affected, and net revenue would fall byan amount exceeding the savings in capitalexpenditure, so increasing borrowing (unlessfurther price increases were allowed).20. No provision is included for absorbing newfinds of gas, such as that in the Ekofisk field inthe. Norwegian sector of the North Sea, if such supplies are made available to the Gas Council.CONFIDENTIAL17

The BSC has proposed a greatly expandedprogramme, envisaging total capital requirements(excluding the effect of changes in value of stocks and working capital requirements) rising from 276 million in 1971-72 to  478 million in1975-76, of which fixed assets investment in theUnited Kingdom would account for from  238million in 1971-72 rising to  387 million in1975-76.3. These proposals by the BSC cannot be con-sidered until the thorough review of its financialposition and development plans, which theSecretary of State for Trade and Industryannounced in the House of Commons on18 March 1971, is complete.4.

1. The programmes as submitted by the PostOffice were generally lower than in Cmnd. 4578.They have been further reduced by the ministry and Treasury for realism by over  30 million in total, of which  28 million applies to the tele-communications programme over the period1971-72 to 1973-74. Allowing for the PostOffice&apos;s own reductions as submitted and thefurther cuts for realism the programmes for fixed assets in the United Kingdom are lower than in cmnd. 4578 for the five years to 1974-75 by thefollowing amounts.Telecommunications   .........42-5Posts and Giro       .........   26-2National Data Processing Service ...   16-92. The telecommunications programme assumesa somewhat slower rate of expansion due to the controlling effect of tariff increases and continuingdelays in the supply of exchange equipment. Theprogramme is based on the continuing high levelof demand for telephones and is designed toimprove profitability (particularly of residentialtelephones) and the quality of the service. Theextension of automatic telephone service andSTD should be virtually complete by the end of1973.11.  Airways and airportsTABLE 11Expenditure on fixed assets in the UnitedKingdoma.

Investment in Posts and Giro is lower, partly because of supply delays and partly because of programme rephasing. The programme is mainly for mechanisation and essential replacement of vehicles and of out-of-date buildings. following the UPW strike early in 1971, the Post Officeinitiated a fundamental review of postal services.Despite sorting mechanisation, these remainhighly labour-intensive, so it is unlikely that anyforeseeable reduction in the type or quality of theservices or of traffic volume would significantlyaffect fixed assets investment over the period inquestion. The future of Giro is also under review by an inter-Departmental working party. Giroaccounts for  4-1 million of fixed assets invest-ment over the five years to 1975-76.4. The National Data Processing Serviceprovides computer services for the other two sides of the Post Office business, and also aims to capture a share of the commercial market. Thequestion whether, in the light of present policies,the investment required for the commercialoperations can be justified is under review. Ifuncommitted investment attributable solely to commercial operations were disallowed, invest-ment over the five years to 1975-76 would bereduced by  12-1 million.  million at 1971 Survey priceslast year, BOAC have reduced their forecastneeds by four 747s and have deferred delivery of two others by a year. Other consequentialinvestment has also been rephased. The figures include the capital cost of five Concordes, on thebasis of the latest price given BOAC by the manufacturers which is considerably higher thanthat provided for last year but still below theprice officials are recommending.191969-70    1970-71    1971-72    1972-73    1973-74    1974-75    1975-76outturn   provisional estimate   estimate    estimate    estimate   estimateoutturn48-6 84-1 65-3 68-0 51-0 121-0 74-026-3 38-7 53-4 49-7 31-3 36-0 50-010-4 8-9        12-8        16-3        24-0        25-0        30-085	3	131-7	131-5	134-0	106-3	182-0	154-0-5	5	-3-7	-0-4	-0-2	-0-1	-!   .&apos;	1 r$j79	8	128-0	131-1	133-8	106-2	182-0	15402	1	3-7	81	5-6	5-0	4-1	2-681	9	131-7	139-2	139-4	111-2	186-1	156-6
b.  British European Airways2. BEA&apos;s programme of expenditure on fixed assets in the United Kingdom shows slightincreases over the revalued Cmnd. 4578 figuresfor 1972-73 and 1973-74 with substantialdecreases in 1971-72 and 1974-75. These are largely due to rephasing of expenditure in respectof estimated Airbus requirements. A decision ona number of issues, in particular the type and timing of the Airbus, has yet to be made and theprogramme is liable to change, though probably not significantly, in an upward direction, in thelight of these.c.  British Airports Authority3. The estimates for the BAA are within theprovision made in Cmnd. 4578 except for 1973-74where there is an increase of  2-9 million overthe revalued 1970 figure, mainly due to an acceleration of development at Gatwick to dealwith the rapid growth of traffic. The figurestake account of expenditure on the Third london airport but are inevitably tentative at this stage and liable to considerable change when detailed estimates of cost and financing have been worked out.12.

Expenditure on fixed assets by the surface transport industries is  89-5 million lower thanthe revalued Cmnd. 4578 total Over the four years1971-72 to 1974-75.  36-5 million of this is accounted for by the notional transfer of BRBexpenditure on the London and south-eastcommuter network from this category to infra-structure expenditure. The real decrease is,therefore,  53 million mainly as a result of lowerforecast expenditure by the National freight corporation and the British Railways Board.a. British Railways board. The first BRB Corporate Plan is beingconsidered by the Department of the Ehviron-ment. At their request, BRB are carrying outfurther studies to supplement the plan, includingthe evaluation of alternative long-term strategies.The expenditure forecast for the earlier years islikely to be needed under any such strategy, butthe later figures should be regarded as provisionaluntil longer-term decisions have been taken inthe light of the further studies.Expenditure on the London and south-eastcommuter network is excluded from the figuresfor 1971-72 and subsequent years; this will beincluded as infrastructure expenditure. Provisionfor investment in ancillaries has in general been limited to that necessary to maintain the valueof the undertakings pending decisions ondisposals.b.  British Transport Docks board. The size of this expenditure is determined bythe forecast level of demand for new port facilities mainly at Southampton, the Humberand South Wales.
c. British Waterways Board4. This expenditure provides mainly for the replacement of craft and of warehousing facilities.d. Transport Holding Company5. Legislation to dissolve the THC and to dispose of its assets is at present being drafted.The timing of the disposals is not certain, and itis assumed that the receipts will be split between1971-72 and 1972-73. The proceeds from thesale of Skyways, which has already beenarranged, are assumed to fall in 1971-72. Becauseof the uncertainty about the timing of the sales,there is provision for some minimum essentialinvestment in 1971-72 and 1972-73,.but nothingthereafter.e. National Freight Corporation6. The NFC expenditure is in respect of theirroad haulage subsidiaries, National Carriers Ltd.(formerly BRB&apos;s freight sundries division) andFreightliners Ltd. taken over from BRB). It is assumed that NFCs shipping subsidiaries will be sold in 1971-72.f. National Bus Company7. Most of the investment proposed is for theCompany&apos;s bus replacement programme, which isa major factor in reducing operating costs.g. Scottish Transport Group8. The proposed investment is for modernisation of the Group&apos;s shipping fleet and piers and forthe replacement of buses and the construction of bus depots.13.

1. Expenditure on roads covers construction,improvements, maintenance and the lighting of:(i) major roads, i.e., motorways, trunk and principal roads; and(ii) other roads and car parks.Expenditure on new construction and improve-ment of major roads (including Ughting) and on maintenance and lighting of motorways andtrunk roads is either financed wholly by theGovernment or subject to specific government grants. Maintenance of principal roads (includinglighting) and all expenditure on other roads andcar parks is a local government responsibility,and is Government-assisted only through therate support grant. It is not subject to central control except in the context of the overall limit on capital expenditure for locally determinedprojects imposed under the terms of Circular2/70, Department of the Environment (116/70Welsh Office) see page 32. Accurate fore-casting is therefore difficult.2. The main justification for a continuingincrease in roads expenditure is the growth oftraffic. The total number of vehicles licensedhas risen from 9\ million in 1960 to 15 milliontoday and is expected to continue to increaserapidly to about 22 million by 1980. At presentsome 2,000 miles of trunk roads in England are seriously congested and, without a rigorousprogramme of road improvements, this level of congestion and the associated economic and sociallosses will rapidly increase throughout the 1970s.In Scotland and Wales congestion is less serious,but the programmes in these countries are aimed at modernising the most heavily trafficked trunkroutes.3. The expenditure figures shown in the tablerepresent a continuation of existing policy. Totalroads expenditure up to 1974-75 shows anaverage annual increase of 6 per cent. Theprovision for 1975-76 represents an increase of5-6  per  cent  over   1974-5.a.  England4. The figures are consistent with the proposals to be announced by the Secretary of State for the environment.   Reductions totalling  38 millionhave been made in the years 1971-72 to 1974-75to compensate for the overspend which arose in1970-71, mainly from the acceleration of pay-ments due to good road-building weather.5. The overall annual increase proposed up to1974-75 is 6 per cent. The roll forward to1975-76 represents an increase of 6 per cent.Within these figures expenditure on the road programme proper (new construction of motor-ways, trunk and principal roads) is planned to grow by an average of 6-1 per cent a year overthe Survey period.6. Local authority current expenditure isexpected to grow by an average of 4-9 per cent a year. This progression reflects the levels ofexpenditure allowed during the last Rate support grant negotiations, although there can be no guarantee that expenditure will be at the rateproposed, as the Government has no direct con-trol in this field.b. Wales7. The programme represents a continuation ofthe policy envisaged in &quot; Wales: The WayAhead &quot; (Cmnd. 3334). The figures differ fromthose shown in Cmnd. 4578 by the addition ofabout  2 million over the period to allow foran increased rate of maintenance expenditurefollowing the Marshall Report.8. Total expenditure is planned to grow by anannual average of 8-2 per cent over the period to 1974-75. The 1975-76 provision is anincrease of 6-7 per cent over 1974-75.c. Scotland9. The provision is consistent with the policy set out in the White Paper &quot; Scottish Roads inthe 1970s&quot; (Cmnd. 3953). No account has sofar been taken of the expenditure implications ofthe Marshall Committee Report, which at pre-sent cannot be accurately calculated.10. Total expenditure is planned to grow by anannual average of 5-5 per cent over the period up to 1974-75. The roll forward to 1975-76represents an increase of 2-8 per cent.

Comparison with Cmnd. 4578 revaluedshows that over all the items there is a reduction on a comparable basis of about  40 million.This is largely offset by a transfer of  36-5 million plus  7 million in 1975-76 (see para-graph 11 below) from the nationalised industriescapital investment programmes. Most of the savings arise on London Transport and passenger transport Executive investment, slippage in theDepartment of the Environment TransportResearch Programme and a reduction in theNFC sundries grant.a.  Support to Nationalised Transport industries british railways board. Under the Transport Act 1968 grants aremade to BRB towards the operating costs of passenger services which are judged to besocially and economically necessary but whichthe Board would otherwise close. The reductionin these grants in 1971-72 and 1972-73 are inthe London and South-east commuter network,which should be viable by 1973-74. The con-stant level of grant in the later years pre-supposesthat increasing losses on some services will be offset by economies and closures of other services. Under the same Act grants are paidto enable BRB to eliminate surplus track andsignalling capacity; these taper sharply and will cease after 1973-74.national freight corporation4.

This provision covers gross expenditure bylocal authorities and nationalised industries on measures designed to assist public transportprojects in commuter areas. The figures nowinclude all expenditure on fixed assets by BRBin the London and South-east commuter area.Hitherto only investment which was thought likely to qualify for grant has been included.This has proved unsatisfactory because it isdifficult in some cases to determine whether ornot projects will qualify for grants and because it does not enable clear decisions to be taken on the proper allocation of resources to railway services in the region irrespective of the extentto which the investment is financed with the help of infrastructure grant.    The total sum trans-ferred from the Nationalised industries capitalexpenditure table is  43-5 million. Apart fromthis transfer and some saving in 1971-72, thefigures are consistent with the estimates in cmnd. 4578.other passenger transporta. London12. Detailed consideration of the investment programme of London Transport is a matter for the GLC. As stated in the 1970 Report the forecasts have hitherto represented the best estimate that can be made of likely levels ofexpenditure since the transfer of responsibilitytook place in January 1970. It is now forecastthat slippage will reduce the estimates in cmnd. 4578 over the period by about  6 million.b. Other13. The Passenger Transport Executives&apos;investment programmes are now clearer thanat the time of the 1970 Report. Provision forthese and other local authority passenger transport investment outside London is about 7 million lower than the Cmnd. 4578 estimates.14. The provision for Scotland anticipates thepossibility that the operators of shipping services to Orkney and Shetland may require financialassistance towards the replacement of theirexisting fleet of conventional ships by more economical vehicle ferries.miscellaneous transport services15. The main items are road safety and research.16. The provision for road safety reflects thelevel of expenditure which the Department hopewill result from their proposal to place a statutory duty for road safety matters on localauthorities. The figures assume an increase of 1-7 million over existing ceilings although this may be offset in part by withdrawal of Govern-ment assistance to the Royal Society for thePrevention of Accidents.17. The programme of Transport Research isnot expected to expand as quickly as previouslyexpected. Over the period reductions have beenmade totalling about  11 million.CONFD3ENTIAL25

Excluding these changes, the Great Britain total in the 1971Survey shows the following changes from Cmnd.4578 revalued:  million at 1971 Survey prices1m    7972   1973    1974-72     -73     -74     -75Great Britain       .      .   4-35    4-72    4- 16    4- 14The main constituents ofthese figures are:Subsidies   (incl.   rent rebate and allowances)	4-	18	4-	58	,-	23		21Improvements Grants .	4-	18	4-	24	4-	26	4-	28Investment (New dwel-								lings and land .	&quot;4	98	- 107.		-	81		85Investment (other)	4-8		+	15	4-	19	4-	26Local Authorities&apos; net								lending	4-	89	4-	82	4-	75	4-	663. The above figures show that in 1973-74 and1974-75 the additional expenditure arising fromMinisters&apos; decisions to increase local authoritymortgage lending for house purchase and fromthe heavy emphasis put on house improvements(a large proportion of the increase in &quot;otherinvestment&quot; is improvement expenditure by localauthorities) is expected to be almost completelyoffset by a reduction in investment in newdwellings and land, and greater savings thanearlier expected in subsidy payments resultingfrom the review of housing finance.  In 1971-72and 1972-73 there will be similar counter-balancing factors except that subsidies especi-ally in 1972-73 show an increase rather thana saving compared to Cmnd. 4578: this ariseslargely for technical reasons the change in thetime pattern of payment of arrears of 1967 and earlier Housing Act subsidies, changes in housingrevenue account balances, etc.-and pardybecause the initial estimates of those savings have since been refined. (The estimates of savingsembodied in Cmnd. 4578 were  25 million in1972-73,  90 million in 1973-74 and  150 million in 1974-75. Current estimates are higher thanthese figures, but because of the technical factorsmentioned above and because of the transfer ofexpenditure from the Social Security bloc to theHousing bloc these savings are not fully reflected in this Survey&apos;s housing figures.) It must alsobe stressed that these estimated savings are ten-tative and subject to a considerable margin of error.a.  Subsidies4. The new system introduces the principles offair rents in England and Wales and full pooledhistoric costs rents in Scotland. Rent rebateschemes will become mandatory in Great britain as a whole, and for the first time local authorities will be obliged to pay rent allowances to quali-fying private sector tenants of unfurnishedaccommodation for which fair rents have been fixed.5. A substantial part of the savings from the review of housing finance will accrue to the supplementary Benefits Commission becausesavings in the housing programme will be offset by payments which will be made by local autho-rities rather than by the Supplementary BenefitsCommission. In Cmnd. 4578 these savings were included in the housing subsidy figures but inthis Survey they are included in the social security programme. Without the transfer,housing subsidies for Great Britain would havebeen lower by the following amounts:  million1972-73     .........       851973-74     ......      ...      1121974-75     ...      ......      1161975-76     .........      128These are sums which would otherwise havebeen paid as supplementary benefits, and will now be paid by local authorities. It is riotpossible to apportion them between England,Wales and Scotland.6. Rent rebates and allowances make up about one-third the Exchequer subsidies in 1972-73,$----1. The provision made for 1972-73 to 1975-76reflects the reform of housing finance which hasbeen agreed in principle by Ministers, the detailshaving been substantially decided following con-consultations with the Treasury and with the localauthority associations. The necessary legislation will be taken in the 1971-72 Session and theremay be further changes then. The new policiessubstantially alter past projections, but althoughthe shape of the new system is broadly established the reform presents considerable difficulties forestimating public expenditure and many of theestimates, particularly of subsidies and rent rebates and allowances, are subject to a widemargin of error.2. Compared to Cmnd. 4578 revalued at 1971Survey prices, the grand total of housing expen-diture for Great Britain in this year&apos;s Surveyshows the following changes:
rising to about 80 per cent in 1975-76. One ofthe most important factors affecting the accuracy of the estimates of these subsidies is the propor-tion of eligible tenants who for one reason or another will not claim their rebates or allow-ances; the take-up of rent rebates is assumed tobe 100 per cent in 1972-73, and for rent allow-ances about 50 per cent in 1972-73 and risingthereafter.7. For England and Wales, fair rents will bereached by stages and it is expected that ulti-mately most authorities will achieve a surplus ontheir housing revenue account, which will extin-guish their entitlement to subsidy and be sharedwith the Exchequer. A number of authoritiesare expected to reach this position by the endof the Survey period.b. Improvement grants8. The provision reflects the increased level of spending on improvement since the passing ofthe Housing Act 1969, and the considerablepublicity which is now being given to the avail-ability of these grants. The large number of older dwellings in need of improvement givesscope for a continued growth of activity in this field. A marked upsurge in grants approved hasalready occurred, and this is reflected in theprovision for 1971-72, but the rate of growth overthe rest of the Survey period is expected to beslower.c. Investment9. The provision for new housebuilding is basedon the following estimated approvals (the esti-mates used in Cmnd. 4578 are in brackets):Ttear England                 Wales                   Scotland1969 (actual)..... 113,100    - 5,845    - 33,750     -1970 (actual)..... 99,500 (119,000) 5,457 (7,350) 20,824 (30,000)1971...... 111,500 (119,000) 6,650 (8,700) 27,000 (30,000)1972 ....... 114,000 (119,000) 7,500 (9,000) 28,000 (30,000)1973 .      .      .      .      .      .      . 114,000 (119,000) 7,850 (9,150) 28,000 (30,000)1974 ....... 112,500 (119,000) 7,450 (9,150) 26,000 (30,000)1975 ....... 111,500    - 7,100    - 24,000     -There has been a significant fall in the expectedpublic sector building programme, which is reflected in the figures of housing investment.It is not yet possible to assess precisely the effect which the reform of housing finance will have on the rate of local authority building. the reform will help sustain investment by localauthorities who need to undertake slum clear-ance and to build to deal with shortages andovercrowding. On the other hand, the advent of higher rents may well bring about an offsettingreduction in the demand for local authority housing. Higher rents will however be reached by stages over a number of years, and for manytenants will be mitigated by rent rebates. Thechange in demand for local authority houses isnot therefore expected to be large enough to cause a further significant decline in the public sector housebuilding programme during the survey period. The continuing need for slum clearance and new building in stress areas,together with new building to meet the needsof old people and lower income groups, is likelyto be enough to^sustain a programme in future years at roughly the 1971 level (which althoughhigher than 1970 is substantially lower than thelevel of 1965-68).10. The other changes of note in investmentconcern investment in improvements by localauthorities, which is increasing for the same reason as improvement grants but at a slower rate. The extent of the increase is exaggeratedby the fact that some of this investment inScotland was not fully scored in Cmnd. 4578:this has now been corrected.d. Lending11. The provision for lending for house purchase for 1971-72 onwards reflects the decision toreplace the system of money quotas by one ofcategories of eligible borrowers. The restrictionson eligibility are expected to hold gross lendingto about  185 million in England,  15 million in Wales and  7 million in Scotland in each ofthe Survey years.12. The provision for loans by local authoritiesto housing associations recognises the effect ofthe Housing Act 1969, which makes associationseligible for loans towards the cost of acquiringhousing for improvement, and gives a higher scale of grant for the work. Provision has been madein the reform of housing finance to enablehousing associations to play an active part inthe building of new accommodation and the con-version of older properties, but the growth inactivity is expected to be gradual.

This heading covers a wide variety of services concerned with public health, avoidance of pollution, improvement of the environment and the development of local facilities and amenities. Most of these are the responsibilityof local authorities.Capital expenditure england and wales. Under the new arrangements, for controlof capital expenditure introduced this year(Circular 2/70 Department of the Environment:Circular 116/70 Welsh Office) capital expendi-ture on the &quot;key sector&quot; services water and large sewerage and sewage disposal schemes continues to have to be approved by Depart-ments, but most of the rest of the expenditureon this programme (other than that by new towns) falls into the &quot;locally determined&quot;sector, within which authorities are free todetermine their own projects subject to an overall limit on the total of their expenditure.It is likely that this new procedure will lead to changes in the pattern of distribution of capitalexpenditure between services both within the miscellaneous Local Services bloc and betweenother functional blocs which include capitalexpenditure by local authorities which now fallsinto the &quot; locally-determined&quot; sector; but it isstill too early to attempt to predict these changes. Accordingly, the present forecastsrepresent continuations of trends from earlier years, and it may well be that the outturn on individual services will be significantly different even though, overall, the total expenditure onlocally-determined services should correspond with the total provision made in this and otherblocs. For next year, it should be possible toproduce forecasts more accurately reflecting thenew priorities of spending which authorities have adopted.3. This new method of control by broadallocation instead of in detail has been reflected in the reduced amount of analysis provided thisyear. The new headings correspond with thosewhich have been used in the Public expenditure white Papers (Cmnd. 4234 and 4578). Aspecial analysis of local authorities capitalexpenditure which brings together their totalexpenditure on &quot;key sector&quot; and &quot;locally-determined &quot; services is provided in AppendixPart Two.
0scotland4. The revised arrangements for control do notapply in Scotland, where capital expenditure bylocal authorities on all these services continuesto be exercised by individual loan sanctioncontrol. For this reason, though the Scottishfigures likewise continue the trends of previous years, doubts about the pattern of spending on individual services in later years of the Surveydo not apply.Basis of capital expenditure forecasts5. The forecasts for water and for sewerage and sewage disposal provide for steadily increasing expenditure to meet the rapidly increasing and inescapable demands on those services due to population changes, new industrial development or essential public healthneeds. The sewerage figures, however, alsoallow for the extra expenditure announced bythe previous Adniinistration in Cmnd. 4373 toenable a backlog of small schemes in rural areas to be cleared, although, due to the delay in implementing this relaxation, and also, inEngland and Wales, to the effects of Circular2/70, it is possible that some of the expendituremay fall in later years than has been forecast.No specific provision has been made for reduction of pollution, although of courseschemes carried out in pursuit of other policiesdo also contribute to this objective.6. Both the English and the Welsh figures aregenerally in line with the forecasts underlyingCmnd. 4578, minor divergences representing no more than some recosting of existing policies.The Welsh figures, however, show an increase for New Towns expenditure of  1 million overthe three years 1971-72 to 1973-74. This picksup slippage in sewerage expenditure in 1970-71and accommodates further growth in com-mercial and industrial development to cater forpopulation growth.7. The England and Wales land drainagefigures include expenditure on the Thames FloodBarrier and associated works, totalling some 56 million over the Survey period. Since thepublication of Cmnd. 4578, the estimates havebeen revised in trie light of later informationboth on phasing and on cost.  They also make provision for expenditure in 1971-72 which wasnot included in the Cmnd. 4578 estimates onwall raising in the London area as an interimdefence measure pending completion of theBarrier itself. The overall effect of these changesis a reduction in the expenditure now forecast for the comparable years of the Survey period.8. The Scottish figures are also generally in line with Cmnd. 4578, except for expenditure ontown and country planning (included in item d).Forecasts are net of receipts and it is now clearthat, in the past surveys, receipts have beenoverestimated by about  2-5 million in eachyear. Adopting revised estimates of receiptsincreases the net expenditure on the service by 10-9 million in the first four years of the survey period, and after allowing for offsetting savings on other items the overall increases areas follows:  million at 1971 Survey prices1970-71    1971-72   1972-73   1973-74   1974-75-3-6      +1-0-5      +0-4      -f 3-29. Apart from these adjustments the previousforecast figures are considered by the scottish development Department to be unrealisticallylow in the light of the established need forredevelopment in Scottish towns and thenumber of schemes now coming forward forloan consent. The Department have revisedtheir forecasts of redevelopment expenditureupwards by a further  1-5 million in 1971-72and by  1 million in each subsequent year to reflect this increased need. Additional provisionof  1-4 million in 1971-72 and  1-2 million in1974-75 would be required to accommodate this increase.Current expenditure10. The forecasts for all three countries reflect,for 1971-72 and 1972-73, the recent rate support Grant Orders. For subsequent yearsthey project forward the expenditure trends onthese services that emerge from these settlements.Over the period of the Survey as a whole theannual rate of growth is approximately 4 percent.CONFIDENTIAL33

Home Departments&apos; ServicesPoliceengland and wales. Expenditure on police is expected to rise by19-0 per cent from 1971-72 to 1975-76. the forecasts assume that police strengths will increase over the period from 94,750 to 113,700. Civilianstrengths are expected to rise from 36,300 to61,500; this includes provision for an increase of15,000 traffic wardens. The figures reflect in full the police pay settlement effective from1 September 1970 which gave an increase of theorder of 16 per cent in a full year, about half ofwhich was of an exceptional nature and involvesan additional claim on resources in excess of 10 million a year. Capital expenditure, after allowing for some reduction in 1971-72 and1972-73, because of the continuing effect of thefinancial constraint on local authorities following devaluation, accords with the 1970 Survey figuresrevalued. Because the recruitment rate has notmatched the 1970 Survey assumptions, totalforecast expenditure is below the 1970 figuresrevalued.scotland . Expenditure is expected to increase by 18-per cent over the period. The forecasts assume that uniformed strengths will increase from10,500 to 11,680 and civilian strengths from 2,890to 4,200. This latter figure provides for 1,150traffic wardens. The costs reflect in full the pay settlement effective from 1 September 1970, the exceptional element of which represents anadditional claim on resources of the order of 1-5 million a year.Prisonsengland and wales. Expenditure is expected to increase by 51- per cent over the period mainly because of theincreased capital programme. Allowance hasbeen made for the relief of the prison problem by the development of probation hostels and more intensive forms of probation and after-care. Themain assumptions are that the total inmatepopulation in prisons, borstals, detention centres and remand centres will rise from 42,550 to52,950, and that there will be an increase of5,200 in non-industrial staff of all grades over theperiod. That increase is needed to relieve theshortage of prison officers and to reduce excessiveovertime, to meet the demands of new establish-ments and to cope with the expected rise in prisonpopulation. Capital expenditure includes pro-vision for an accelerated building programme(including the adaptation of &quot; camp sites&quot;) tomeet to some extent the forecast increase in prisonpopulation. The projected programme of new works and adaptations will nonetheless provide no more than 9,000 of the 10,400 places requiredover the period simply to prevent overcrowdingbecoming worse. At present nearly 14,000inmates are sleeping 2 or 3 in a cell. This numbermay increase by between 3,000 and 4,000 if thebuilding programme is not fully realised.scotland. Expenditure is expected to increase by 46-6per cent over the period mainly because of an expanding capital programme. The total inmatepopulation is forecast to rise from 5,300 to 6,400in 1975-76 and an increase of 730 staff isprojected. At present approximately 2,000inmates are sharing single cells, and even with theadditional accommodation for which the forecastsprovide there is likely to be a shortage of 600places at the end of the period.Probation and After-care (England and Wales)5. Expenditure is expected to rise by 47-3 percent over the period. The main assumptions are that the number of probation officers will rise from,425 to 4,350 and ancillary staff will increase from 75 to 500 during the Survey period. Pro-vision is also included for expenditure of 0-5 million in 1971-72, rising to  3 million inCONFIDENTIAL 35
91974-75 but subsequently decreasing, for anextension of probation hostels, particularly for adults, estimated to provide some 1,900 places for adult offenders and thereby afford a measureof relief to the overcrowded prisons. This pro-gramme has been absorbed, by a switch of resources, within the combined totals of forecastexpenditure for prisons and probation and after-care, without exceeding the revalued 1970 Surveyforecasts.Fire services england and wales6. Expenditure is forecast to rise by 8-6 percent during the period. The main assumptionsare that there will be a growth of 1,100 whole-time firemen and 580 civilians for the basic needsof the service over the Survey period, includingextra manpower needed to implement the FirePrecautions Bill. In addition, and followingagreement reached with the local authoritiesduring the rate support grant negotiations, afurther increase of some 840 firemen and 110civilians is assumed between 1971-72 and1972-73 (costing  0-75 million and  1-5 million in these years) in order to implement the Reportof the Departmental Committee on the fire service (Holroyd) and mainly to provide for improved training. For 1973-74 onwards it hasbeen assumed that the additional expenditureresulting from Holroyd will level out at 2-0 million a year which represents the costs ofa total of some 1,120 whole-time firemen and 145civilians in post together with their associatedadministrative costs for the remainder of theperiod to 1975-76.scotland7. Expenditure is expected to increase by 18 percent over the period. The forecasts assume anaverage annual increase of about 75 whole-timefiremen and related increases in civilian staff.Other services england and wales8. Expenditure, most of which is on grants to statutory or voluntary bodies, is forecast to riseby 50-8 per cent over the period. This is mainly due to the continued expansion of the urban programme for areas of special social need whichis expected to rise from  6-6 million to 11-0 million over the period, and an expectedannual increase of 900 (i.e., from 9,000 in1971-72 to 12,600 by 1975-76) in CriminalInjuries Compensation Board cases. Provision of 0-1 million a year has been made for additionalrepatriation costs arising from the ImmigrationBill from 1972-73 onwards. Moderate expansionis also assumed in the work of the community relations Commission ( 0-4 million rising to 0-6 million) and the Race Relations Board( 0-2 million rising to  0-3 million); expenditureon grants-in-aid to the Women&apos;s Royal voluntary service is expected to remain constant at  1-million.scotland9. This includes provision for the Urban Pro-gramme which is estimated to rise from 0-8 million in 1971-72 to  1-3 million in1975-76.Comparison with Cmnd. 4578england and wales10.

For 1972-73 the apparent excess is attributable to the effect of the arbitrary cuts takeninto account in Cmnd. 4578 in order to bringlocal authority police expenditure into line withfigures accepted for the rate support grantsettlement; these cuts were agreed withoutprejudice to the 1971 forecasts.scotland11. Forecast expenditure on Home Departments&apos;Services (excluding law courts and legal aid)compares as follows with the figures published in cmnd. 4578, revalued to 1971 Survey prices (and including a real increase of  1-5 million arisingfrom the police pay settlement):  million	1971-	-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75Cmnd. 4578 revalued	. 53	-2	56-1	59-1	61-41971 Forecast .	. 53&apos;	2	56-3	60-0	62-7			+ 0-2	+0-9	+ 1-3The increases are on account of the expandedprison programme, payment in respect of theScottish share of the cost of the police nationalcomputer project and the cost of central publicity for police recruitment.
will require further substantial revision. Theincrease compared with the corresponding figures in Cmnd. 4578 is just over  2 million spreadover the Survey period.17. The Scottish Sheriff Courts are not coveredby the Beeching recommendations. They are however being reorganised on a very similar basis as a result of the recommendations of the GrantCommittee. The effects on public expenditure are however much less complex than the effects of the parallel operation in England and Wales,and although the reorganisation is unlikely totake effect before 1972-73, full account of it wastaken in the 1970 Survey. In consequence thereis relatively little change in the level of expendi-ture on Scottish courts compared with last year,the main change being the deferment of somecapital expenditure producing a reduction of 0-8 million in 1973-74.18. Despite the increases in expenditure onmagistrates&apos; courts and on the higher courts thepresent forecasts are slightly below those in cmnd. 4578. The reduction is attributableprincipally to the fact that in the 1970 Surveythere was some double counting of capitalexpenditure and expenditure on salaries in thehigher courts.c.  Legal aid19. The forecast expenditure is an estimate ofthe demand for a service to which all eligiblepersons are entitled. There is no scope for reducing the level of expenditure without areduction in the scope of the Legal Aid Schemes,which could not be achieved without legislation.20. The forecasts for legal aid in Great Britainassume that the number of both civil and criminal cases in which legal aid is granted will continueto rise, resulting in an overall increase in expenditure of  9-9 million (43 per cent) overthe period of the Survey.21. The figures show increases over Cmnd. 4578revalued of  3-5 million in each of the forwardyears, due mainly to a reassessment of natural growth and, in respect of 1971-72 and 1972-73,also to a reassessment of the effects of transferringundefended divorce from the High Court to theCounty Court.22. In addition to the expenditure included inthe forecasts, Ministers have been asked toconsider proposals by the Lord Chancellor forthe introduction of a new scheme for legal advice and assistance which would add an estimated 1-3 million net in 1972-73, rising to  2-1, [million net in 1975-76.i-b.  Law Courts12. The programme covers expenditure on bothhigher and lower courts in Great Britain as wellas the costs incurred by departments concernedwith the administration of the judicial system.13. The main factor determining the level ofexpenditure is the work load of the courts, butin the next few years expenditure will also be significantly affected by the implementation ofthe recommendations of the Beeching Commissionon Assizes and Quarter Sessions.14. The provision for magistrates&apos; courts isabout  1 million a year greater than thecorresponding figures in Cmnd. 4578 for theyears 1971-72 onwards. This reflects a continuingincrease in the volume of work as well asprovision for an accelerated building programmefollowing the assumed transfer by local authoritiesto the central Government of some existing buildings for use as higher courts as a result ofthe Beeching recommendations. Provision isalso made for the introduction in 1971-72 of a financial loss allowance and improved subsistenceallowances for justices of the peace. Earlierestimates of the cost of these allowances havebeen revised and it is now expected to increase from  0-4 million in 1971-72 to  0-6 million in1975-76.15. Following the proposed introduction on1 January 1972 of the new courts systemrecommended by the Beeching Commissionresponsibility for the higher courts will betransferred from local authorities to the centralGovernment. This transfer of itself should not affect the rate of expenditure, but in fact sincethe Beeching Commission was appointed in 1966, the resulting uncertainty about the futureresponsibility for the courts service has led to a lower level of local authority expenditure,particularly capital expenditure, than would otherwise have been incurred. The level ofpublic expenditure, during the Survey period and thereafter, will be affected both by the need tomake up this backlog and by the cost ofremedying other deficiencies in the existing provision of higher courts in accordance with theBeeching recommendations. Because of thedistortion in the pattern of spending on highercourts it is impossible to say with any accuracyhow much additional expenditure there is in the survey period because of the Beechingrecommendations.16.

The figure for museums and galleries purchase grants for 1971-72has been reduced by  0-1 million, representing special advances of the purchase grant provision for 1971-72 made to twoinstitutions during 1970-71.5 Expenditure relating to England and Scotland on maintenance of buildings and running expenses, stationery, superannuation,etc., is included under Common Services in Table 19.II This includes grants to the British Institute of Recorded Sound, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal ScottishGeographical Society, assistance to local museums in carrying out co-operative schemes and provision for surveys in museums,arts and crafts.Coverage1. The Arts programme now includes capitalexpenditure on museums and galleries by theDepartment of the Environment. Current and capital expenditures on the new British Libraryhave also been included provisionally, but thefuture attribution of this expenditure is underdiscussion. As in previous years expenditure bylocal&apos; authorities is excluded except for theGreater London CounciPs contribution to theNational Theatre. No provision is made for theapplication of ADP to the British Library. Afeasibility study, now nearing completion, isexpected to justify a substantial investment inADP and pending the results of the study theDepartment considers that provision of the orderof  0-2 million in 1972-73 rising to  1-3 million in 1975-76 should be made in the forecasts.National museums, galleries and libraries2. Provision for the national museums and galleries allows for the maintenance of, and additions to, the collections. The other policyassumptions are that there will be a net yield of 1 million from entrance charges for museums and galleries in each year beginning with 1972-73,and that capital expenditure will increase overthe same period for the expanded building programme announced by the Government. Theadditional capital expenditure included in the forecasts are  0-3 million in 1972-73,  0-5 million in 1973-74,  1-6 million in 1974-75 and 1-2 million in 1975-76.Other Arts3. Provision for the current expenditure of the arts Council assumes an annual rate of growth in real terms of 10 per cent. For 1971-72 onlya special additional allocation of  1 million wasmade available for current expenditure on OtherArts. This sum has been excluded in the calculation of the rate of growth for subsequent years. The capital provision is primarily for theannual commitment ration for Housing the Artsand the Governments contribution towards theNational Theatre. The provisions for the arts council include the provisions for the scottish and Welsh Arts Councils and are intended to foster the creative arts generally and to stimulateartistic activity in the regions.

9GENERAL1. The forecast is that between 1971-72 and1975-76 expenditure in Great Britain will riseby  377-2 million or 3-1 per cent a year. Forthe first time provision is included in this programme for the education of mentally handicapped children as this responsibility was transferred on 1 April 1971 to the DES from theDHSS. Expenditure on schools and ancillary services in Wales, transferred to the Welsh office on 5 November 1970, is now dealt with in aseparate section below.2. In line with the assumptions in Cmnd. 4578,manpower engaged in the education service(excluding universities) will increase by about - 9 per cent a year over the period from 906,000in April 1971 to 1,046,000 in April 1976.3. The basis of the estimates is the continuation of existing policies. No attempt has been madeto anticipate Ministerial decisions on the futureprovision for higher education or on theextension beyond 1972-73 of capital programmes for the improvement and replacement of oldschools (but see paragraph 10 below).4. The main reasons for the increase in expenditure remain as before: the consequences of raising the school leaving age; the growth inthe number of school leavers qualifying for higher education and the provision made forthem; and the progressive improvement in the teacher/pupil ratios towards accepted targets.ENGLAND (including post-school education in wales and universities in Scotland)5. The costs of existing policies have been revised to take account of the latest forecasts ofpupil, student and teacher numbers. estimates of local authority current expenditure for 1971-72 and 1972-73 are determined by the rate support grant settlement for those years; pro-objections of such expenditure in later yearsproceed from that base.6. On 1 April 1971 building cost limits foruniversities, colleges of education and further education establishments were raised by 20 percent, and those for schools and the youth service by 8 per cent on account of increases in pay and prices. The cost limits for school and youth service buildings were also raised by a further5 per cent to enable the standard area per pupilto be restored to levels agreed in 1966, makinga 13 per cent increase in all.7. The forecasts of capital expenditure providefor building starts as follows:  million at 1971 Survey prices1971    1972    1973    1974    1975-72     -73     -74      -75      -76Schools      .     . 206-2 207-2 138-1 115-2 97-5Further education .   27-8 25-1 37-2 42-6 42-0Teacher training .    3-7 3-0 3-0 3-0 3-0Universities  .     .   36-0 30-0 52-2 68-4 62-4Youth service, etc.    6-7 6-7 7-0 7-0 7-0Total280-4   272-0  237-5   236-2   211-9Local libraries    .    7-8     6-0     6-8     7-1     7-1Schools (England)8. Forecasts of current expenditure are relatedprimarily to the estimated number of teachers in service. In primary and secondary schools thisis expected to rise by 18-3 per cent from 356,000in 1971-72 to 421,300 in 1975-76; this rate of growth is designed to reduce the number of pupils per teacher from 22-1 to 20-5 (takingyear-end numbers). Provision is also made for improvement factors in non-teaching costs of3^ per cent in 1971-72 and 3 per cent a year in subsequent years. This projects into 1973-76the agreed Rate Support Grant factor of 3 percent in place of 2\ per cent a year embodied in last year&apos;s Survey.9. Pupil numbers in primary schools areexpected to fall from 4-82 million in 1971-72to 4-75 million in 1975-76 after reaching a peak of 4-87 million in 1972-73. Secondary pupils,on the other hand, are expected to rise from-07 million to 3-80 million; of this increase25 per cent or 182,000 is attributable to the raising of the school leaving age. Altogetherpupil numbers are expected to increase over theperiod by some 8 per cent.10. In addition to providing for these changesin the school population, the building programmetakes account of agreed decisions on starts forthe replacement and improvement of old schoolsup to and including 1972-73 when the figurewill be  40-1 million. Thereafter the replace-ment and improvement element is restricted toCONFIDENTIAL41
 11-3 million a year. The Secretary of Statefor Education and Science regards this figure asquite inadequate. The total work urgently required to make good existing deficiencies isestimated at  270 million; to come within ameasurable distance of this target in what in herview would be a reasonable period of five years from 1972-73 calls for additional starts of 34 million a year in 1973-74 and of at least the same amount in both 1974-75 and 1975-76,generating additional expenditure of  96 million in the Survey period. To achieve this she isprepared to find half the cost ( 48 million) outof resources diverted from university building programmes as described in paragraph 15 below,if additional resources are provided for therest.11. The building programme for special schoolsprovides for a small increase to help relieve the acute shortage of places in certain types of school. Training centres now transferred fromthe local health authorities to the local educationauthorities are not included in these figures since there is as yet no starts programme for them;but small provisional additions have been madetc the estimates for capital expenditure. Trans-fers from the Health and Personal Social Servicesprogramme ranging from  9 -1 million to  9-9million have also been made to the annualestimates of local authority current expenditureon special schools to meet their new respon-sibility for the education of mentally handicapped children.Further education (England and Wales)12. Current expenditure and building pro-grammes provide for student numbers (full-timeequivalent) to rise from 689,000 in 1971-72 to713,000 in 1972-73 and thereafter to fall to687,000 in 1973-74 (the effect of raising theschool leaving age) before rising again to 725,000in 1975-76 an overall increase of just over  per cent. These building programmes make no specific allowance for improvements (otherthan within minor works) and contain only asmall margin for residential and social accom-modation. The Secretary of State for education and Science considers that, particularly at thisstage in the development of the polytechnics, an effort should be made to set new and appropriatestandards for non-teaching areas. This, it isestimated, would require additional starts of 8-3 million,  10-2 million and  9-0 million in the years 1973-74 to 1975-76 and additional capital expenditure of  19-5 million in the survey period. This could be met from the savings on university building programmesreferred to in paragraph 15 below.Teacher training (England and Wales)13. Capital expenditure remains geared toprogrammes designed to accommodate 120,000students by 1973-74. The starts of  3 million a year after 1971-72 are intended to provide forthe replacement of the worst sub-standardbuildings. Future policy for teacher training and its relationship with the other sectors of higher education will need to be decided in thelight of the report of the James Committee.Universities (Great Britain)14. The programmes from 1973-74 to 1975-76have still to be settled, and the building startsfigures shown for those years are thereforeprovisional. The main purpose of the pro-grammes will be to provide for increasing studentnumbers. The starts figures for 1973-74 and1974-75 are higher than those underlyingCmnd. 4578 because it has been found that thelatter were based on an over-estimate of university capacity: the number of universityplaces which will be available after the comple-tion of authorised programmes is now expectedto be 5,000 less than in last year&apos;s estimate. Asthe estimate of student numbers remains unchanged, it is necessary to increase thebuilding programme to avoid a shortage of places.15. The forecasts of student numbers remainsubstantially the same as those underlyingCmnd. 4578, rising to 288,000 in 1974-75 from237,000 in 1971-72. The projection of 314,000for 1975-76, which is on the same basis, would lead to a total of 341,000 students in 1976-77.However, to meet the cost of her proposals atparagraphs 10. and 12 above, and also certainconsequential expenditure (notably in Scotlandand Wales), the Secretary of State is ready to restrict the growth of student numbers to a totalnot exceeding 320,000 (full-time equivalent) by1976-77, and also to slow down the rate of increase in postgraduate students. these measures should produce a combined saving on capital and current account of the order of 105 million.Youth service, local libraries and museums16. These programmes provide for a continua-tion in .1975-76 of the level of expenditureapproved for 1974-75. On 1 April 1971 bothprogrammes were transferred to the locally-determined sector of local authority capital programmes; they will therefore be subject to review in due course in the light of the actual expenditure incurred by the authorities under thenew arrangements.

The forecasts of capital expenditure providefor building starts as follows:  million at 1971 Survey prices1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-7614-4	14-0	7-7	6-6	4-9onwards, will be insufficient to achieve the objective of eliminating the sub-standard 19thcentury primary schools. These are a special problem in Wales since there is a higher propor-tion of pupils in old schools in the principalitythan there is in England. The Secretary of Statefor Wales considers that a realistic figure to achieve this objective would be  6 million for1973-74 and, for planning purposes, the samefigure for later years. It is proposed that this increase should be met in the same way as is described for England in paragraph 10 above.21. Current expenditure is determined largely bythe number of pupils and teachers, and in Walesthese are expected to show similar trends tothose in England. The total of primary pupilsis expected to show a decrease of 5 per cent between 1971-72 and 1975-76, from 302,400 to286,500. By contrast, mainly as a result of raising the school leaving age, the total of second-dary pupils is expected to increase by 20 percent from 199,400 to 239,400 over the sameperiod. The combined increase in primary and secondary numbers in these years is forecast as  per cent compared with teacher numbers which rise by 12  per cent from 24,000 to 27,000.22. It is estimated that the number of pupilsper teacher in Welsh primary schools will improve from about 25 in 1971-72 to about 22in 1975-76. However, because of the raising of the school leaving age, there will be no improvement in the teacher/pupil ratio in Welshsecondary schools; it should just be maintained at about 17 pupils per teacher over the period1971-72 to 1975-76.SCOTLAND (excluding universities)23.

Schools24. Forecasts are related to an estimated increase in pupil numbers of over A\ per cent from 973,400 in 1971-72 to 1,017,800 in 1975-76 and to the number of teachers estimated tobe in service in the same period, 46,500 risingby about 14^ per cent to 53,300. Staffing stan-dards are expected to improve to a level whichis in accordance with present policies in primary schools by the end of the period. In the secondary schools the forecast is related to thenumber of teachers likely to be available. a review of the staffing standards to be adoptedin the future should be completed by the endof 1971.25. The capital programme allows for popula-tion growth and shift but not, in the Secretaryof State&apos;s view, a sufficient amount for improve-ment and replacement in 1973-74, 1974-75 and1975-76 and, if adjustments are made in theprogramme for England as proposed in para-graph 10, the Scottish programme would alsofall to be adjusted. In addition, it is consideredthat the amount allowed for special schools in1975-76 is insufficient.Further education26. The forecasts reflect the continuing demandfor courses at all levels and an expected increase,between the academic years 1971-72 and 1975-76,in the total number of students (expressed asfull-time equivalents and excluding those takingevening recreational courses), of about 18 percent from 51,665 to 60,925, and in the numberof teachers, of about 19 per cent, from 5,800to 6,915. The improved standards for non-teaching areas in further education establish-20.  Health and personal social services table 20ments proposed in paragraph 12 would, if accepted, also apply to further education estab-lishments in Scotland, involving an increase inthe provision under this head.Teacher training27. The number of students in colleges of educa-tion is expected to rise by about 20 per cent,from 14,825 in 1971-72 to 17,760 in 1975-76.This increase will contribute to the improvementin staffing standards referred to in paragraph 24.Other services28. Forecasts for university awards reflect the expected growth in the number of Scottishstudents qualifying for awards (28,000 in1971-72 and 35,700 in 1975-76, an increase of nearly 21\ per cent); and those for social and recreational education, administration, the libraryservice, etc., assume the continuation of existing policies. Expenditure on meals and milk isexpected to fall from  11-1 million in 1971-72to  9-7 million in 1975-76 as a consequence ofthe increased school meal charges and the pro-posed limitation on the distribution of free milk to primary school children.Comparison with Cmnd. 4578 (Scotland)29. The total forecasts for 1972-73 and 1973-74show increases by comparison with Cmnd. 4578of  0-7 million and  1 million respectively; thismainly results from that part of the cost limitincrease in school building (5 per cent out of13 per cent) attributable to restoring standards.The total forecasts for 1974-75 are below the comparable Cmnd. 4578 figures by  2-3 million.  million at 1971 Survey prices1969-70    1970-71    1971-72    1972-73    1973-74    1974-75    1975-76outturn provisional   estimate   estimate   estimate   estimate    estimateoutturnCapital expenditure england	116-9	122-2	1460	158-6	160-3	160-6	160-family practitioner services .	01	0-5	0-2	-01	0-6	0-9	-Community health and welfare services:							Local health authority services .	9-8	9-9	11-8	12-2	12-4	12-7	13-local personal social services   .	29-5	30-5	38-9	44-9	46-6	48-7	51-other central services and grants	3-6	3-5	3-1	3-0	3-5	2-4	2-6Total England	159-9	166-6	200-0	218-6	223-4	225-3	227-5

Provision for the Scottish central services is included under other Central Services and grants.Coverage1. The health and personal social servicesprogramme covers the expenditure previouslyincluded under health and welfare (excludingjunior training centres in England and wales which are now within the Education block) withthe addition of expenditure on child care inEngland and Wales and social work in Scotland,transferred from the law and order programme.These transfers amount to:  million at 1971 Survey prices1971-721972-731973-741974-751975-76Child Care(England     andWales) . . 75-8 79-9 85-4 89-1 94-6Social Work(Scotland) . . 27-4 29-5 31-1 32-7 34-4Basis of Table2. For the years up to and including 1974-75the figures essentially represent a revaluation andrecosting of the programme announced in Cmnd.4578. All health items controlled as blockbudgets have been revalued and no allowance hasbeen made for any further increase above theadditional  110 million spread over the years1971-72 to 1974-75 made available in Cmnd.4515. On certain other items account has beentaken in the 1971 forecasts of (a) slippage, and (b)) recostings based on information not incorpora-ted in the 1970 Survey. The net result is that therecosting for the whole programme shows thefollowing decreases:  million at 1971 Survey prices1971-72    1972-73    1973-74    1974-754-4100-80-53. For 1975-76 the main problem has been todetermine the most appropriate projection of the totals in Cmnd. 4578 in the light of theannouncement in Cmnd. 4515 that forwardexpenditure plans had been adjusted to providefor new expenditure amounting to  110 million over the years 1971-72 to 1974-75. It will be for ministers to decide whether these additions shouldbe carried forward into 1975-76. The forecastsin the Table take account of the higher levels ofexpenditure in 1974-75 resulting from theadditional  110 million, and from these levelsproject forward at about the same rates of growthas for previous years implied in Cmnd. 4578.Neither the Health Departments nor the treasury are committed to these figures see paragraphs and 7 below.Manpower4. The manpower forecasts for the health and personal social services are in line with thoseimplied by Cmnd. 4578.   The total for this
programme is planned to rise from 877,000 at thebeginning of 1971-72 to 1,003,000 at the end of1975-76: almost three-quarters of the total fore-cast manpower are employed in hospitals and about one-fifth in Local Authority, Health and personal Social Services. The Treasury commentthat the 1971 pay settlement for nurses, notincorporated in the expenditure forecasts,represents an annual increase of the order of 15 per cent after 1971-72. The Treasury take theview that this will involve an additional claim on resources of over  10 million a year. The health departments point out that the increase was theminimum that had to be offered in the circum-stances and the settlement was agreed by ministers collectively.Implications for major services. The figures in Table 20 imply the followingfor the main health and personal social services:(a) HOSPITAL BUILDING programme the figures included for advances to hospital authorities for the basic building programme are:		 	million	at 1971	Survey	prices	1971		1972	1973	1974	1975	-72		-73	-74	-75	-76England	. 137&apos;	-5	149&apos;2	150-3	150-0	150-1Wales	.    7&apos;	0	7-1	6-9	6-9	8-scotland   .	.   18	-4	19 0	19-0	19-5	19-5This programme is controlled as a block budget and the figures up to 1974-75 are the totalsimplied in Cmnd. 4578 revalued. In each year from 1972-73 these totals reflect increases ofmore than  6 million (Great Britain) from theadditional  110 million; the total for 1974-75is broadly the same as for 1973-74. This totalhas been repeated for 1975-76, except for Waleswhere the forecast returns to a level pro-portionate to population following fluctuations in earlier years.(b) HOSPITAL CURRENT expenditure the advances to hospital authorities for current expenditure take up approximately half of thetotal expenditure on health and personal social services. Like the building programme theyare controlled by means of a block budget, andthe central decision is the annual rate of growth in real terms. A continuation of the 3J percent allowed for in Cmnd. 4578 is assumed.For 1975-76 the growth is from the higher1974-75 level resulting from the allocation of 13 million from the additional  110 million inthat year.(c) FAMILY PRACTITIONER services the figures for the General Medical, Pharma-ceutical, Dental and Ophthalmic Services, un-like those for the main hospital services, do not represent block budget control figures, but thebest available forecasts of likely expenditurebased on current assumptions about staff numbers and renumeration, and current policy on charges. Some control of gross expenditure is exercised through control of remuneration,and in the longer term through control of numbers (e.g. of doctors by decisions on thenumber of places at medical schools). Thecurrent forecasts assume that consultation willcontinue to be provided free, and that chargeswill be broadly related to 50 per cent of thecost for drugs and dental treatment, and 100 percent of the cost of providing spectacles. It is assumed that there will be no change in the range of exemptions and refunds. No account has yet been taken of the proposal to convertentitlement to refunds of dental and ophthalmiccharges at the expense of the social securityprogramme into exemption at the expense ofthe health programme. This will require a transfer between the programmes.(d) LOCAL AUTHORITY SERVICES(i) CapitalThe bulk of the capital expenditure by localauthorities on health and personal social services will remain under central control under the new arrangements for &quot; keysectors &quot;. In the period 1972-73 to 1974-75sums in excess of  6 million a year were added from the additional  110 million. ForGreat Britain as a whole, taking into accountfluctuations within the figures for the three countries and shifts between health and personal social services, the average rate of growth forecast for the period is some 4-5per cent for health, most of which will betransferred to the unified NHS, and 7 percent for the personal social services whichwill remain outside the NHS.(ii) CurrentThe present forecasts take account of theRate Support Grant settlements for the years1971-72 and 1972-73. The figures for 1973-74 and 1974-75 are broadly the 1970 Surveyfigures revalued, but not modified to take account of these settlements for the two preceding years, which (except for social work, Scotland) were at a lower level than was assumed in the progressions for 1973-74
and 1974-75 in Cmnd. 4578. The view ofthe Health Departments is nevertheless thatthese figures represent the level ofexpenditure which should be attained by localauthorities in the years in question. TheTreasury cannot judge whether these levelscan be attained until more is known aboutthe expenditure performance of LocalAuthorities following the additional amountsmade available to them from the  110 million at the 1970 Rate Support Grant settlement.The annual rates of growth assumed inprojecting the figures into 1975-76 are:Health per centEngland and Wales . . . . 2-7Scotland......5-0Personal Social services england and Wales . . . . 9-scotland (Social Work)   .     .     .     6-1A combined rate is given for England andWales as they form part of the same rate support Grant negotiations and settlements.(iii) general in these figures no account has been taken of the reorganisation of the NHS which willshift the bulk of local health authority expenditure to the new NHS area health authorities.Case for increased expenditure6. The Health Departments take the view thatCmnd. 4578 made inadequate provision for health and personal social services. In particularDHSS consider that the figures in Table 20 makeinadequate provision for expenditure on health and personal social services, especially because:(i) they make no provision for increased expenditure on hospital building towards theend of the Survey period which the Depart-ment regard as necessary, if the problem ofobsolescence is to be overcome within areasonable period;(ii) they do not allow for the temporary increase in costs which DHSS see as aninescapable consequence of the reorganisation of the NHS;(iii) even with the additions necessary becauseof (i) and (ii) the allocations barely providefor normal development of the services and do not enable necessary measures to be takento eliminate serious deficiencies in areas ofgreatest need, particularly in the services forthe elderly and the mentally handicapped.7. The Treasury comment that the provision in cmnd. 4578 must be regarded as making adequate provision for all services within the limit of available resources. They add that there is a continuing remit to regard the limits in Cmnd.4578 as maxima and to seek further savings.21.

As usual the figures for each year include an amount of  2  million which is available for the minor adjustments to theschemes which are needed between the upratings.6. The estimate for 1971-72 shows the expected cash outturn but for later years the estimates reflect the decline in the real value of benefits between upratings.7.   The supplementary benefit figures show the programme with the effects of the reform of housing finance see paragraph 9.Policy assumptions1. The programme is a projection of the social security programme underlying Cmnd. 4578, as modified by the subsequent Ministerial decisionsmentioned below. On some points, however, theDepartment of Health and Social Security donot agree that it represents current policy, or have reservations (see paragraph 12).Upratings2. The policy underlying Cmnd. 4578 was thatthe 1971 uprating would take place on1 November 1971 and be in line with price move-ments only (plus  45 million for selectiveimprovements in a full year) and the 1973 up-rating would be in line with the movement ofprices plus 60 per cent of the difference between that and the movement of earnings since 1971.It was later decided that the 1971 uprating shouldbe brought forward to 20 September 1971, andshould be fixed at  1 in cash terms on the singlerate of pension; this was on the understandingthat if in the event this turned out to exceedwhat was needed to compensate for the move-ment of prices, the 1973 uprating would bereduced by the percentage of the real termsincrease in 1971. The actual movement of pricesup to 20 September 1971 will not be knownuntil near the end of the year. Meanwhile ithas been assumed provisionally that the  1uprating represents a real terms increase of 3-6per cent. The 1973 uprating in this programmeaccordingly has first been calculated on the assumed movement of prices, plus 60 per cent of the difference between that and the movementin earnings since 1971, and then reduced to take account of the real improvement in 1971. Onthese assumptions the amount available for realimprovements at the 1973 uprating would beabout  30 million in a full year.3. It has been assumed that there will be afurther general uprating on 1 October 1975, andthat this will be in line with the movement of earnings since 1 October 1973. This is not intended to imply a settled policy for upratingsafter 1973, but only to give Ministers a full range of options.Family allowances4. Family allowances are assumed to remainfixed in money terms throughout the period.This means that on the given assumptions aboutthe movement in prices, they would have declinedin real value by over one-sixth by 1975-76, com-pared with 1971-72. It was however agreed by ministers that at the appropriate time it wouldbe possible to consider claims on the contingency reserve for up to  15 million a year to provide additional help for poor families.Family income supplement5. In the December 1970 PESC Report it was explained that because of the difficulty of estimating the cost of family income supplement the figure of  7 million had been given for eachyear in the survey after 1971-72. The level ofthe supplement (which is not due to start untilAugust 1971) has now been raised so as to make some allowance for assumed movements in earn-ings. The actual cost of the supplement will depend on the future relationship between thelevel of the supplement and the level of earnings.In the circumstances the indicative figure of  7 million has again been shown for each year after1971-72.Supplementary benefits interim uprating6. The programme makes no provision for anyuprating of supplementary benefits in 1972 or1974, i.e., between the general upratings.Earnings   related   supplement   to   short-termbenefits7. In view of the extension of graduated contri-butions in the 1971 uprating, the rides forcalculating the earnings related supplement toCONFIDENTIAL49
short-term benefits have been changed. Insteadof 33J per cent of earnings between  9 and 30, it is to become 33J per cent of earnings between  10 and  30, and 15 per cent of earnings between  30 and  42. This change is estimated to cost about  6 million in the first year, 1973-74.It was agreed that half this cost should be met from the existing social security programme andthat there was no commitment for any further extension of the limits if the earnings limit forcontributions were again raised. accordingly the programme for 1973-74 has been increasedby only  3 million in respect of this item, andno further alteration in the limits has been assumed for the period of the Survey.Reconstruction of national insurance8. The target date for the introduction of areconstructed national insurance scheme is nowApril 1975. As it has been assumed that the basic benefits of the scheme will not be changedand that the benefits of the proposed reserve scheme will not count as public expenditure, noextra expenditure has been provided in the pro-gramme on account of the reconstruction ofnational insurance.Reform of housing finance9. The assumed expenditure on supplementary benefits is reduced by the following amounts totake account of the proposed reform of housing finance (see paragraph 3 of the Housing Sectionof the Report).  million at 1971 Survey prices1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-7684-6	112-5	116-4	128-0Rate of growth of the programme10.

The Department&apos;s reservations are asfollows:earnings   related   supplement   to   short-term benefitsa. As agreed no provision is made for any alteration in earnings related supplement inconnection with the 1973 uprating. HoweverDHSS feel that it will be necessary to raisethe ceiling for graduated contributions again in 1973 and that this will make it almostinevitable that the limits for earnings related short-term benefit (the floor of  10, the per-centages, the break point at  30 and the ceiling of  42) will have to be reviewed at the sametime with some possible extra expenditure.Before then the form of earnings related un-employment and sickness benefit in the recon-structed national insurance scheme will havebeen settled, and the provision in the pro-gramme for these benefits will have to bere considered next year in the light of those decisions.maternity grant and death grantb. Cmnd. 4578 reflected agreement thatmaternity grant and death grant should remainfixed in cash terms for the five years of the1970 Survey programme. The present pro-gramme extends this process by making no provision for any increase in the grants in the october 1975 uprating. The DHSS take theview that there will be a case for some increase at that uprating in these grants which are intended to cover specific personal outlays. by then maternity grant will have remained un-changed for six years and death grant foreight years, against a historic and assumedbasis pi rising prices.   The DHSS feel that
it may be difficult to allow these benefits to decline any longer, provision should be madefor them to have their purchasing powerrestored in 1975.supplementary benefitsc. The assumption is that prices will rise on average during the Survey period by about-6 per cent a year. In these circumstances the DHSS consider it quite unrealistic toassume that there would be no interimupratings of supplementary benefit in 1972 and1974, particularly since there has been an up-rating of supplementary benefits in every yearsince 1961 (with the exception of 1964).attendance allowanced. In the 1970 review discussions it was envisaged that any improvement in the attend-ance allowance provisions in the next two orthree years (for example, extension to casesrequiring  day  attendance  only) would  be financed out of the amount available for the1973 uprating. In the view of DHSS this may need to be looked at again in the light of the eventual size of the 1973 uprating. Theamount available for real improvements at thatuprating is already likely to be small (seeparagraph 2) and the cost of extendingattendance allowance (which may reach  30million by 1975-76) would limit it still further.family supporte. The programme assumes the continueddecline of family allowances in real terms, andconsequently in effectiveness, with no alterna-tive provision apart from the  15 million which ministers have agreed might be made avail-able from the contingency reserve. this assumption will need to be reconsidered in thelight of the interim report by the interdepart-mental working group on the Review of family Poverty, which will be submitted to ministers early in June.22.

Just over half of the total is for the InlandRevenue, with smaller sums for Customs and excise, the Department of the Environment,DHSS and local authorities. Additional staff are required by the Inland Revenue to cope with the increasing workload, implementation of a revised National Insurance Scheme and the registration of labour-only sub-contractors, partly offset by the rundown of the Surtax Office. Theestimates for Customs and Excise makeallowance for the replacement of purchase taxby a Value Added Tax. The estimates for theDepartment of the Environment include pro-vision for the staff of the Centralised Vehicle andDriving Licence project at Swansea.CONFIDENTIALb.  Royal Mint2. The Royal Mint figures represent the costof provision of normal United Kingdom coinrequirements, plus in 1971-72 some replacement of  sd coins still in circulation.3. The overall reduction of  2-6 million in thefigures for the four years 1971-72 to 1974-75results from a forecast greater use of scrap coinfor new production than was anticipated earlier;from a scaling down of forecast levels of coinsrequired to replace  sd coins and to cover the continuing expansion in coin circulation; andfrom a rephasing of the expenditure (totalling 1-8 million) on the equipping of Phase II of51
the new Mint at Llantrisant, replacing the closing Tower Hill Mint.4. Forecast expenditure by the Department ofthe Environment on buildings for the new Mintat Llantrisant (mainly Phase II) is included in line d. of the Table (Other financial administra-tion, etc.) and amounts to some  3-1 million( 0-1 million in 1971-72,  0-7 million in 1972-73,  1-3 million in 1973-74 and  1-0 million in1974-75).c.

This now covers expenditure by the Depart-ment of the Environment on the furnishing and operating costs of accommodation occupied bymost Civil Departments, but the capital expendi-ture on new works is now confined to office and storage accommodation for Civil departments and one or two special services such as theHouses of Parliament. Expenditure on new works at most research buildings, at museums and galleries and at Government training centreshas  been transferred to the relevant public expenditure programmes. These changes havetaken effect since the 1970 Survey and partlyaccount for the variation in expenditure forecastssince then.2. A large part of the 1970 new works expendi-ture forecasts was accounted for by computerbuildings for the Inland Revenue and offices inLondon., As a result of the review of the tax system no new contracts for Inland Revenuecomputer centres are currently being let, whilstthere   have   been   delays   due   to   planning52CQNFD3ENTIAL
difficulties in two major building schemes inLondon (Vauxhall and Whitehall). Therephasing has led to an overall reduction ofcapital expenditure during the five-year period within which it rises by  22 - 5 million due mainly to late starts for the computer buildings andheadquarter offices. The overall reduction hascounterbalanced to a considerable extent the increases in maintenance and running costs. Ithas been necessary to increase the forecasts forrents since the previous assumptions about thegrowth and cost of the estate, at constant prices,have proved inadequate.3. General policy on the future size of theCivil Service has not yet been worked out in specific overall limits for the full period. But,as the Special Analysis on Civil Service Man-power shows, the costings of Departments&apos;programmes refleot an increase in numbers ofnon-industrial civil servants of 34,100 over thefive-year period. Expenditure on rents foraccommodating these additional staff is includedin the costing of this programme as follows:  million1971-72   1972-73   1973-74   1974-75   1975-761-73-84-96-88-8To the extent that the Government may decide on policies which would reduce or eliminate theneed for these additional staff, this margin withinthe costing of this programme would be correspondingly reduced.4. Provision has also had to be made for thefurnishing and running costs of the HigherCourts which the Government will take over from local authorities; although this is largelyoffset by a reduction in provisions elsewhere inthe public expenditure forecasts there is some extra expenditure due to the expansion of theCourts programme described under Law andOrder.5. No provision has yet been made in the fore-casts for accommodation for any new dispersalinitiative.b.   Stationery Office (Home)6. Expenditure is to meet expected require-ments of Government Departments, together withthe Stationery Office&apos;s administrative and other costs. The rising figures for capital expenditure are largely for computers and other officemachinery. Processing of work on computersproduces savings in staff and other costs on other programmes.c.   Central Office of Information home publicityservices7. Forecasts which Departments made of their home publicity requirements have been reducedsubstantially for realism. Provision in theperiod to 1974-75 is below that in Cmnd. 4578.No account is taken of any changes in the composition of the Central Office of information which may result from the Newton Report.24.

a.  Records, registrations and surveys. This includes expenditure by several Govern-ment Departments (the Office of population censuses and Surveys, General Register Office(Scotland), Land Registry, Ordnance survey and minor expenditure in other Departments)and a smaller proportion of local authority expenditure. Provision is made under the Officeof Population Censuses and Surveys for theSocial Surveys carried out as an allied service for Government Departments.2. Expenditure will diminish after 1971-72 on completion of the 1971 Census.b(i).  British Broadcasting Corporation (HomeServices)3. The figures cover capital requirements ofthe home broadcasting services, including expenditure on colour television and residualexpenditure on 20 local radio stations. TheCorporation^ expenditure (capital and current)is financed by Government grant which since1961 has consisted of the whole of net licencerevenues. Apart from the year 1971-72, netcapital expenditure is below the figures shownin Cmnd. 4578. This is due mainly to theCorporation^ decision to apply a  5 million cut in the period 1971-72 to 1974-75 to enable itto keep within its income. Television licencefees are to be increased from 1 July 1971 butnot to the full extent sought by the Corporation.As the incidence of the cuts has yet to bedecided, the annual figures (but not the total) areprovisional. Expenditure in 1971-72 is 2 million higher than in Cmnd. 4578 becausemajor purchases of land and buildings weredelayed from last year.b (ii).  Independent Television Authority4. Expenditure covers the capital requirementsof the Authority in providing transmitters andrelay stations to broadcast the programmes of independent television companies. The authority is financed by means of the rentals which itcharges to the companies. The capital programme is at a slightly lower level than that provided in cmnd. 4578 because of delays in the delivery oftransmitters. Pending the necessary legislation,no provision is included for capital expenditurearising from the introduction of commercialradio, supervision of which will be by the ITA(to be renamed the &quot;Independent broadcasting authority &quot;) in accordance with the White Paper&quot; An Alternative Service of Radio Broadcasting &quot;(Cmnd. 4636).c. Meteorological services. This covers the cost of services provided for both defence and civil purposes. These estimates are also included in the Defence Budget (Table 1)and an equivalent reduction is made in other military Defence (Table 2) to enable the item tobe shown here. The increase in 1971-72 is dueto the purchase of a large computer.d. Civil defence6. The forecasts are based on the existing care and maintenance policy, which is at present underreview. The review will present a range of alternative programmes within the range of 7-15 million a year for Ministerial decision.e. Royal Parks and Palaces, Historic buildings and ancient monuments, etc.7. This covers expenditure by the Secretary ofState for the Environment, and the Secretaries ofState for Scotland and Wales on services which include the upkeep of the Royal Parks, main-tenance of ancient monuments and grants to owners of historic buildings.f. Other miscellaneous services. This includes expenditure by the Civil service department, the Cabinet Office, the public trustee, salaries and administration costs of theMinistry of Posts and Telecommunications, civil list annuities and pensions.9. Receipts of  4-3 million are included inrespect of estimated proceeds of the assets of theState Management Districts of Carlisle, Gretnaand Cromarty which are to be wound up. timing of the sales is uncertain and the figure is splitevenly between 1971-72 and 1972-73.10. The capital expenditure of Cable and wireless Ltd. is included for the first time andthe figures are provisional, subject to adjustmentfollowing detailed review later this year. Thecompany, which is wholly owned by the Treasury,is self-financing. It operates solely overseas,providing international communications and internal telephone systems for a number of countries. It is an important link in the Com-commonwealth Telecommunicadons system.

The public expenditure estimates for NorthernIreland have been prepared by the NorthernIreland Departments. They refer to those services for which the Northern Ireland Government is responsible and as such are not subject to detailedcontrol from Westminster. The overall level ofexpenditure on these services is howevercustomarily subject to agreement between thetwo Governments and is determined with regardto the parity of services in Northern Ireland andGreat Britain, taking into account the special needs of the province, as well as the overallconstraints on public expenditure in the UnitedKingdom.2. Because the figures in the table representpublic expenditure for which the Northern ireland government is responsible, they do not include expenditure on such items as defence and mostagricultural support, which is contained in the relevant United Kingdom programmes.3. Discussions have been held with the NorthernIreland Government concerning their response tothe policies announced in Cmnd: 4515 as a resultof which further reductions in expenditure of 0-5 million in 1971-72 and  9 million in 1974-75(at 1971 Survey prices) have now been made, inaddition to the  2-5 million and  8 millionincluded in Cmnd. 4578. A further saving of 3 million in each year of the Survey period arises from the reduction in SET.4. Overall the Survey shows Northern Irelandexpenditure to be in excess of the revalued fore-casts in Cmnd. 4578 (taking into account the reductions in paragraph 3 and excluding social security increases) by between  20 million and 30 million in each year of the Survey. Thesefigures include an increase of  5 million in eachyear to allow for previously unreported items and provision of  7 million in 1971-72 for the Harlandand Wolff shipyard. Discussions are in progressbetween the Treasury and the Ministry of Finance,Northern Ireland about the basis and implications of their forecasts.26.

1. The basis of the calculation of debt interest is set out in paragraph 8 of Appendix Part 3(Methodology). In particular it should be notedthat the calculation rests on the conventionalassumption of unchanged interest rates. It mustbe regarded as subject to some margin of errordepending on the interaction of future changesin the public sector borrowing requirement (itself a figure sensitive to changes in revenue project-tions), in interest rates and in the price index of gross domestic product (GDP) at factor cost.2. The debt interest figures in this report aregenerally higher than those published in Cmnd.4578. These changes are mainly due to higherforecasts of public sector borrowing requirement.

1. In this section the forecasts of current expen-diture on local authority services describedprogramme by programme in Part 1 of theAppendix are brought together. Apart fromthe exceptions noted below, the price basis ofthe forecasts is identical with that of the current rate Support Grant Orders.England and wales. The outturn for 1969-70 reflects the actualoutturn submitted by local authorities and isabout  20 million, on a Rate Support Grant basis,below that previously forecast. For 1970-71 itis still expected that outturn will, in total, be broadly in line with previous forecasts, but in thelight of the actual outturn for 1969-70, substan-tial variations are expected for individual services.These variations have been reflected in theprovisional estimates of outturn for 1970-71.3. For 1971-72 and 1972-73 the individualservice figures and the totals reflect the December1970 Rate Support Grant settlement as adjustedfor subsequent events. On the one hand theyhave been reduced to reflect two specific policy decisions which could not be taken into account in. the main Rate Support Grant Order but whichwill be reflected in any future Increase Order:the withdrawal of free milk in junior schools(reductions of  5-3 million and  8-0 million),and the provisions of the Courts Act under which certain responsibilities are to be transferred from local authorities to the central Government on1 January 1972 (reductions of  2-0 million and 14-2 million). On the other hand, the price basisof the present forecasts of current expenditureincludes the cost of the recent pay award for police which was not included in the main order(additions of  19-0 million and  19-2 million),and the adjustments to a Rate Support Grantbasis include additional loan charges on educationarising from a recent decision to increase thebuilding cost limits (additions of  30-5 million and  33-5 million). These additions, which willalso be taken into account in a future rate support Grant Increase Order, more than offset the policy reductions. In addition the figures for expenditure on police take account of manpowerforecasts which are higher than those accepted for the main Rate Support Grant Order.4. With the exception of Health and personal social services, the forecasts for the individual services for the subsequent years project forward the expenditure trends which emerged from theRate Support Grant settlement and they take account of the adjustments referred to in theprevious paragraph. In addition the figures forMiscellaneous local services take account of theeffect on current expenditure of the higher levelof capital expenditure which is now forecast onsewerage.5. The forecasts for Health and personal social services for 1973-74 and 1974-75 are broadly the 1970 Survey figures revalued, but not modi-fied to take account of the Rate Support Grantsettlement for the two preceding years, whichwere at a lower level than was assumed in theprogressions for 1973-74 and 1974-75 in cmnd. 4578. The view of the Health Depart-ments is nevertheless that these figures representthe level of expenditure which should be attained by local authorities in the years in question. TheTreasury cannot judge whether these levels canbe attained until more is known about theexpenditure performance of local authoritiesfollowing the additional amounts made availableto them, from the  110 million in Cmnd. 4515,at the Rate Support Grant settlement.6. The forecasts for all services from 1969-70onwards represent in percentage terms the follow-ing rates of growth from year to year Per cent1970-71       1971-72      1972-73       1973-74       1974-75       1975-76Total current expenditure (PES basis) .      .        4-1 3-7 3-7 5-1 4-1 4-4Total revenue expenditure (RSG basis)      .        5-2 4-3 4-4 5-7 4-7 4-8Scotland7. The Scottish figures are generally on a similar basis. The figures for 1969-70 and 1970-71reflect, both in total and for the individual services, the actual outturn for 1969-70. Thiswas about  6 million, in Rate Support Grantterms, above the forecasts of expenditure accepted for Rate Support Grant.8. For 1971-72 and 1972-73 the forecasts reflect the February 1971 Rate Support Grant settlement with similar adjustments, except for the effectof the Courts Act, to those referred to in para-graph 3 above, (i.e., reductions of  0-9 million and  1-3 million for withdrawal of free milk;additions of  2-7 million and  2-8 million forthe police pay award; additional loan charges on
education of  0-5 million and  0-9 million).The forecasts for the subsequent years take account of these adjustments, and also, from1973-74, of the transfer of certain responsibilitiesfrom local authorities to the central government under the provisions of the Sheriff Courts(Scotland) Bill.   Apart from these adjustments,the forecasts for the subsequent years projectforward the expenditure trends which emerged from the Rate Support Grant settlement.9.

10. Starting with the financial year 1971-2, thearrangements for controlling capital expenditure by local authorities in England and Wales havebeen significantly changed and the table reflectsthese changes. Full details of the new arrange-ments are set out in circular 2/70 of theDepartment of the Environment (116/70 welsh office), but their broad outlines are as follows.11. Capital expenditure is divided into 3 categor-ies. &quot;Key sector&quot; schemes continue to besubject to specific approval by departments.Land acquisition associated with such schemes in the fields of education, housing and principalroads no longer requires approval since it is assumed to be related to approval programmes ofnew construction in these fields; improvementsunder the Housing Act 1969 are also free ofcontrol. Within the remaining &quot; locally deter-mined &quot; sector local authorities are free to incurcapital expenditure subject to an overall annuallimit on payments; within their annual allocations,and subject to a provision for carry-over to thefollowing year of over or under spending of up to 10 per cent, authorities can determine theirown priorities between projects and services. Inthe case of counties, the allocations cover boththe county councils and the district councils andit is for the authorities within the county jointlyto determine how the allocation is used.12. To arrive at the total of allocations to authorities it is necessary to make adjustments to the PES forecasts shown in the table. Forecastexpenditure from revenue and from capital fundsis deducted since such expenditure does not count against authorities&apos; allocations. An addition ismade to take account of known discrepanciesbetween capital payments returns by local authori-ties and their final account figures (e.g. variations in treatment as between capital and revenue).Finally, an allowance is made for the amount bywhich local authorities are expected, in aggregate,to underspend their individual allocations. (For1971-72 these adjustments totalled approximately 37 million, resulting in a total allocation figureof  399 million.)13. Two points need to be made concerningthe reliability of the forecasts. First, thepresent breakdown between &quot;key sector&quot; and&quot; locally determined&quot; schemes is subject to review in the light of experience. It is likely that some changes will be made which will affect1972-73 and subsequent years. Secondly, the breakdown between services within the &quot;locally determined&quot; category reflects the estimates by departments of what local authorities would havebeen likely to spend had the previous loan-sanction control arrangements continuedunchanged. Since one of the main objectives ofthe changes is to give local authorities greater freedom to decide priorities within this area itis likely that, in future surveys, the breakdownwill need to be substantially modified to reflect the outcome of these local decisions.Scotland14. There has been no change so far in thearrangements for controlling capital expenditure by local authorities in Scotland. The table below,therefore, simply draws together the forecasts of expenditure by Scottish local authoritiesincluded in the functional tables, and theprovisos regarding accuracy of the breakdownbetween services do not apply.Capital expenditure of local authoritiesScotland   million at 1971 survey prices1969-70    1970-71    1971-72    1972-73 1973-74    1974-75    1975-76outturn   provisional estimate    estimate estimate    estimate    estimateoutturn1.

(Grind. 4506).t Including museums and galleries in Scotland.1. An increase of 34,100 in the total numberof non-industrials is forecast over the five year period 1 April 1971 to 1 April 1976; in per-centage term this is 6-8 per cent or an average annual rate of 1 - 3 per cent. During this period,total central Government expenditure is forecastas rising by 0-2 per cent a year.2. The crude manpower figures conceal anumber of reclassifications to or from the CivilService which, however, are not significant inoverall public sector manpower terms. Thesereclassifications include staff for work which atthe present time is a charge to Local Authorities&apos;manpower e.g. vehicle and driving licences andQuarter Sessions; on the other hand forecasts for 1 April 1972 onwards exclude about 6,700DTI staff who are to become employees of theCivil Aviation Authority. Other hivings-off/transfers-in are under review but have not been allowed for in the forecasts.3. The total cost of wages and salaries for non-industrial staff is estimated to rise between1970-71 and 1975-76 by  110-5 million (11-9per cent) at 1971 Survey prices. additional expenditure on accommodation and other over-heads are estimated to add some 25 per cent tothe cost of salaries and wages.4. It should be noted that other public sectormanpower (e.g. NHS staff,1 Local Authority staffincluding teachers,2 police,3 etc., also otherCentral Government employees, i.e., industrial civil servants and staff locally engaged overseas,and members of the Armed Forces) is of muchgreater significance both in numerical andfinancial terms.1 See Appendix Part 1, page 47, paragraph 4.2 See Appendix Part 1, page 41, paragraph 2.3 See Appendix Part 1, page 35, paragraphs 1-2.
5. The table above breaks down the numbersof non-industrial Civil Servants into eight groups of departments plus a residual element. InGroup 1, concerned with defence and externalpolicy, the Ministry of Defence (including the procurement Executive) at about 128,500 is by far the largest element and accounts for nearly all the reduction of about 3,100 up to 1 April1976.6. The main cause of the increase in Group 2is the decision to introduce VAT in substitution for purchase tax and SET with effect from1 April 1973.* It is forecast that the numberof staff in Customs and Excise will need toincrease from the present level of 18,100 to over24,000 from 1 April 1973 onwards. InlandRevenue numbers are continuing to grow,reflecting increasing workloads during the period when changes in taxation are to be introduced.The rate of growth has been checked from1973-74 onwards by the decision to integratesurtax with income tax and the Chancellor has announced his intentions to introduce changes which would have the effect of further reducingthe staffing requirements of the Inland Revenue.In the meantime an increase of about 1,650 isprovided for in 1974-75 when the InlandRevenue take over new responsibilities for collecting graduated contributions under thereconstruction of the National Insurance Scheme.7. In Group 3 the Department of Health and social Security accounts for nearly 8,000 of the overall growth, the main element of which ison account of demographic growth particularlyin the number of pensioners. The Departmentof Health and Social Security forecasts alsoallow for the extra staff needed for introducingnew schemes, including the reconstruction of theNational Insurance Scheme. An increase ofabout 2,400 staff in the Department of Employ-ment reflects new work in respect of theIndustrial Relations Bill and Equal Pay inaddition to the increasing demands on theemployment services on account of the rise in4 See Appendix Part 1, page 51, paragraph 1.5 See Appendix Part 1, page 35, paragraphs 3-4.6 See Appendix Part 1, page 11, paragraph 3.7 See Appendix Part 1, page 37, paragraph 15.the number of unemployed and the expansion ofthe industrial training programme. these increases more than offset the reductions due tothe abolition of SET and REP.8. Nearly all of the increase of 5,900 staff in theDepartment of the Environment is required forthe Centralised Licensing (Vehicle and Driving)Project at Swansea.49. The main Scottish Departments reporting tothe Secretary of State for Scotland, knowncollectively as the &quot;Scottish Office&quot; cover a wider range of services than the Home Office.These two have been grouped together becausethe largest single cause of expansion in bothDepartments is the growth required in the PrisonServices5 to meet the forecast increase in the prison population.10. The main reason for the reduction inGroup 6 is the hiving-off from DTI of 6,700staff to the Civil Aviation Authority.6 The DTIforecasts also allow for the rundown of the investment grants offices. The Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food forecasts show areduction of about 800; this stems mainly from the reduction of functions announced inthe Minister^ White Paper of January 1971(Cmnd. 4564).11. The County and Criminal Courts (Group 7)have provided for additional staff over the fiveyears in anticipation of the continuation of a growing trend of cases, but the biggest increasein this group is the intake of 3,225 localauthority staff for work arising from the courts act.7 The Land Registry are forecasting a net increase of 1,150 over the five year period. this includes provision to deal with the plannedextension of compulsory registration of title toland; this issue is being put to ministers collectively for decision.12. In Group 8 an increase of 300 is forecast for the Department of Education and science and of about 1,100 for the museums and galleries(including about 100 posts for the introductionof admission charges). A decision has alreadybeen taken to set up a National LibrariesAuthority but the timing is uncertain; thefigures in the table do not reflect the consequent reduction of about 1,200.

The broadpicture of an overall decline in R &amp; D expendi-ture over the period of the Survey reflects, infact, a sharp reduction in spending by theDepartment of Trade and Industry (focusedespecially on civil aerospace), which is partiallyoffset by a modest increase in most other areas,including the two other main R &amp; D spenders,the Ministry of Defence and the Department ofEducation and Science.2. A short commentary on the main pro-grammes follows.3. The defence R&amp;D programme is designedto assist the Services to meet their equipmentrequirements in the most economical and effective way compatible with the budgetary andresource restraints on the equipment pro-gramme. These requirements arise from the commitments placed on the Services by the government&apos;s defence objectives as set out in chapter one of the statement on the defence estimates 1971 (Cmnd. 4592).  The development programme is divided up under the broad head-ings of military aircraft; guided weapons;satellite communications; electronics; ship con-struction, naval weapons and equipment; andordnance and other army equipment. Inaddition there are a number of other minor fields of work. These main headings includeactivities carried out on a collaborative basis with a number of other nations. Details of themain projects involved in this breakdown aregiven in chapter VI of Cmnd. 4592. the research programme is controlled by manage-ment by objectives procedures including anannual review to determine future trends and possible changes of emphasis. This involvesconsideration of research programme packageseach related to one of nineteen major fields of research (aerodynamics, aero engines, armoured fighting vehicles, etc.). The machinery involvedin the control of the R &amp; D programme isintended to meet the specialist equipment need of the services taking into account the economic,strategic, logistic, operational, budgetary, technological-logical, industrial and political factors whichinfluence the nature and source of equipmentprocurement.
4. The entry for Research Councils comprisesvirtually the whole of the Science Budget, bywhich the Department of Education and Sciencedischarges its responsibility for civil science.The breakdown of the Science Budget betweenthe various Research Councils and other bodies concerned, together with the related agricultural research expenditure in Scotland, is shown intable 6B of Appendix Part I and the accompany-ing programme text. The greater part of this expenditure is on basic research. The initiation of the scientific research for which the Depart-ment is responsible rests with these bodies. TheCouncil for Scientific Policy considers thebalance of scientific effort contained in their proposed research programmes and advises theSecretary of State on the scientific prioritiesinvolved. The main functions of the research councils are to carry out, and to encourage and support, research and development in science and technology and in the social sciences. this they do in their own institutes, or in institutes towhich they give a grant in aid or by givingresearch grants and fellowships to persons inuniversities and other bodies.5. The Department of Trade and Industry&apos;sprogrammes are mainly directed towards theDepartments broad objective of assisting Britishindustry and commerce to improve their economic and technological strength and com-petitiveness. There are also programmes tomeet Government requirements which are determined by statutory obligations or admini-strative or operational needs.    The forecastsinclude expenditure by Government research establishments and those of the Atomic energy authority; grants to research associations; otherextramural support for industrial technology;shipping services; civil aviation services (until1971-72 after which responsibility rests with theCivil Aviation Authority); and grants to ICLin respect of the computer merger scheme (upto 1971-72). Individual items in the programmes are under review and the figures for R &amp; D arein some cases arbitrary pending completion ofthe reviews. The forecasts also include expendi-ture on civil aerospace (principally the develop-ment costs of Concorde and the RB-211)recently transferred from the Ministry of aviation Supply.6. Other Departments&apos; expenditure on R &amp; Dis, relatively, less significant. The programmes of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and food are concerned with agricultural develop-ment, control of animal and plant pests anddiseases, fisheries research, food science research,and botany research. Those of the Departmentof the Environment cover environmentalplanning, construction, and transport research,including expenditure by the Departments sixresearch establishments. The Department ofHealth and Social Security is concerned mainly with research into medical equipment, hospital building, locally organised clinical research, and medical, social and operational research into the function of the health and personal social services.
5.  Demographic projections1. There are a number of demographic and social factors to which the planning of some ofthe major programmes of public expenditure is related. As an experiment, which will be con-tinued in future Surveys if it proves useful, theseare brought together in the following Table.Demographic Projections (Great Britain)Average annual		1966	1971	1976	percentage increase 1971-761.	population (000)......	53,018	54,513	55,834	0-5	1.

6. Impact on family incomes of Government measures1. The object of this analysis is to provide asnapshot of the direct effects on typical familystructures of the measures taken up to the dateof this report by the Government affecting public expenditure and taxation. Account is taken also of movements in incomes and prices.2. Columns (b) to (/) of the table show the impact of the various public expenditure andtaxation measures announced by the Chancellorof the Exchequer on 27 October, and in his budget statement, on the financial position ofthose in the income ranges covered.3. It should be noted that the increases inprescription charges and in ophthalmic and dental charges shown in the table are weeklyaverages of the whole non-exempt population.The cost for those actually using the servicesand paying the charges is far higher in the weeks in which charges are made; for example, theincrease in the charge per prescription item is-J-p. The table should be read with this impor-tant reservation in mind. On the other hand, the table shows for school meals the extra cost perweek (15p for each child) in term time; averagedover the whole year the figure would be lHp(in respect of families with children the table isbased on the assumption that one child is belowschool age).4. The table does not show the effect of increased rail fares following the withdrawal ofthe grant to the London network, the withdrawalof free school milk in junior schools (7-11 years old), or the increase of  1 a week ( 1-60 for married couples) in retirement pensions.5. Subject to these points the table measures the full effects of the measures as they wouldbe in the coming Autumn. Further changes,will occur in 1972. In particular the table doesnot reflect a move to graduated payments forprescriptions. It is estimated that this will increase the average cost per item from 20p to30p, and double the average charges shown inthe table, but the pattern of payment betweenincome levels shown in the table is unlikely to beaffected.6. The table illustrates how, within the incomeranges covered, the measures have providedlarger net gains to the larger families. At the lowest income level the Family Income Supple-ment (FIS) provides very substantial assistanceto families with children. Above these levels thereduction in taxation, particularly the increase inthe child allowance, and the exemptions andremissions of charges provide the assistance.7. The number of prescriptions for which nocharge is levied should remain broadly unchangedas a result of the Government^ measures and theaverage effect of the changes in exemption andrefund arrangements for dental and ophthalmiccharges should also be small. About 175,000children will have become eligible for free school meals, as a result of the change in the exemptionlevel: and about 170,000 families, including about450,000 children, will become eligible for the family income supplement. On the basis of an85% up-take about 150,000 families including400,000 children will benefit from FIS initially,though this is likely to decline in the first year of operation as incomes rise.8. The levels of income in column (a) of the table refer to weekly gross family incomes,including family allowances in the Autumn of1971. It is assumed that wages will haveincreased on average by about 12 per cent sincethe Autumn of 1970 and prices by about 8^- percent. The resulting increase in spending power is partly offset by the increased payment of tax and graduated pension contributions arising fromthe progressive rates on increased gross income,which result in a higher proportion of theincreased incomes being taken by tax and gradu-ated pension contributions. Column (k) shows the effect of this progressiveness (excluding theeffects of the changes already measured incolumns (b), (h) and (Q). It remains finally to measure the increase in purchasing power of thenet income as it would have been but for theprogressiveness of the tax and graduated pensioncontribution rates; this is done in column (/).Columns (k) and (/) together reflect the realchange in net incomes (excluding the effects ofthe measures) as a result of the wage and price increases. Generally these columns record netgains but for the families with children thereare income levels between  20 and  30 a weekwhich show a reduction.9. Column (m) shows that overall the lowestwage earner with children will have benefitedthe most, but the higher income levels improve their position compared with column (/) becauseof the effect of increased purchasing power.CONFIDENTIAL15

PART THREEMETHODOLOGY1. These notes explain the conventions andclassifications used in the 1971 Public Expendi-ture Survey.Definitions and coverage2. In order that the figures in the Survey maybe consistent as far as possible with the statistics and forecasts of national income andexpenditure, they adopt the principles and definitions which the Central StatisticalOffice use for recording public sector transactions in the national income accounts. The public sector comprises central Government (includingthe National Insurance Funds), local authoritiesand public corporations (including the national-ised industries). Apart from transactions onoperating account by public corporations andother trading bodies, all current and capitaltransactions by the public sector are covered inthe Survey. Transfers between the public sector and other sectors are included butinternal transfers, such as central government grants and loans to local authorities and public corporations, are generally eliminated. Indirecttaxes, including selective employment tax paidby public authorities, are included as part ofthe cost of the programmes to which they relate.Subsidies to public authorities&apos; trading servicesand to public corporations are also included,since they are paid to their operating accounts.3. One departure from the national accountingdefinitions is that the figures of current expendi-ture in the Survey exclude imputed rents whichare used in the national income statistics to measure the value of the use made of publicly-owned fixed capital assets in the provision ofpublic services; this is because of difficulties ofestimation and deficiencies of coverage.Shortfall4. The estimates for all years include an allowance of  100 million for shortfall to correcta tendency for actual expenditure in any yearto be less than the estimate made at thebeginning of that year. A separate allowance for nationalised industries&apos; shortfall is made inthat programme (see Appendix Part I, page 13,paragraph 3).Price basis5. The constant price basis of the individual programmes in all the tables, apart fromTables 5 and 7 of the Main Report, is that of1971 Survey prices. This price basis correspondswith that of the 1971-72 Supply Estimates, for current expenditure on goods and services andsome transfer payments, apart from the reducedrates of selective employment tax announced inthe April 1971 Budget. The estimates for gross domestic fixed capital formation are mostly for march 1971 prices. In some cases, however,such as roads and education, they relate to theprice basis currently in use for planning purposes. The programme estimates have been converted from 1971 Survey prices to estimatedoutturn prices for 1971-72 by means of an overall adjustment.6. Most current grants, subsidies and capitaltransactions are estimated in money terms, thatis, at the amount expected to be disbursed ineach year, irrespective of price changes whichmay by then have occurred. In order to measure the demand on real resources implied by these expenditures, the cash estimates havebeen deflated in all the summary tables toconstant 1971-72 outturn prices. For overseas aid, housing subsidies and current grants and social security this adjustment has been appliedto the programme estimates, using a pricedeflator appropriate to the expenditure involved.For other programmes an overall adjustmentrelated to the estimated movement in the price level of the output of the economy as a whole,as measured by the gross domestic product(GDP) factor cost price index, is included in theline &quot; Relative price effect&quot;.7. For certain types of subsidies the estimates are taken as representing 1971-72 outturn prices.Agricultural subsidies are the most importantexample.8. The forward figures of debt interest involvethe neutral assumption that interest rates con-tinue at their present level. Allowance is madefor some change in the total amount of debt andfor  the  refunding  of   current  debt.    These
projections of debt interest are made at the out-turn prices of each year and deflated to constant1971-72 outturn prices by the GDP factor cost price index.Relative price effect9. The relative price effect arises because theprices of goods and services purchased by public sector outlays (either directly in the caseof expenditure on goods and services or indirectly in the case of transfers to other sectors of the economy) tend to move differ-entially from prices in the economy generally.This means that for any future year public expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product measured at conventional constant prices will not reflect precisely public expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product whenmeasured at the actual prices of that future year.Nor will the use of real resources by the public sector be correctly stated.10. The major component of the relative price effect arises on public sector wages and salaries.Over time, the productivity of labour in the economy will be rising. So the cost of employ-ing a given amount of labour in the public sector, in terms of the potential output from theprivate sector which has to be foregone will risein step with productivity in the private sector.Rising productivity in the private sector will be accompanied by rising real earnings in thatsector and real earnings in the public sector willhave to follow the same trend if the necessarydistribution of the labour force is to be achieved.Expressing public sector programmes at con-stant pay and prices therefore progressivelyunderstates their cost because it does not allow for the increase in opportunity cost arising fromproductivity changes in the private sector. (Infact a rise in productivity in the public service is occurring continuously through advances intechnology, in organisation and in trainingmethods. But the national income conventionsfor expressing public expenditure at constant prices preclude any measurement of the extentto which a better service is provided for a givenutilisation of resources.)11. Although the relative price effect is normally most marked in the case of the wagesand salaries content of public expenditure, inprinciple it should be applied to all types of transactions; the estimates in this Survey include an allowance for the differential price movementof all components of public expenditure.12. In calculating the relative price effect forthe 1971 Survey programmes, for the years1972-73, 1973-74 and 1974-75 the relative price effect applicable to wages and salaries and toall other categories of expenditure measured at constant prices has been estimated on the basisof the price relativities underlying the corres-ponding calculations in Cmnd. 4578. Thoserelativities were based on an analysis of the pastrelationship between the price movements in thevarious components of expenditure (measuredat factor cost) and the movement in the GDPfactor cost price index. The relative price effect for 1975-76 has been calculated by extrapolatingthe estimated trend to 1974-75.13. No further adjustment for the relative price effect is required for those programmes, or partsof programmes, which are estimated in money terms and converted to 1971-72 outturn prices by the GDP factor cost price index. such expenditure will form the same proportion ofGDP whether measured at the outturn pricesof each year or at constant 1971-72 outturn prices. But overseas aid, housing subsidies and current grants and social security (excludingadministrative costs) are adjusted to 1971-72outturn prices by special index numbers and sosome further relative price adjustment isnecessary for these programmes; this adjustmentis the difference between the special indexapplied to each of these programmes and theGDP factor cost price index.14. For 1971-72 there is no relative price effector deflation of cash programmes since the pricebasis of the programmes, after adjustment from1971 Survey to 1971-72 outturn prices, is on an identical outturn price basis to that of GDP.15. For 1969-70 and 1970-71 figures of provisional outturn are prepared by departments at both the outturn prices of each of these yearsand at 1971 Survey prices. The figures for individual -dual programmes in all the tables, apart fromTables 5 and 7 of the Main Report, are at 1971Survey prices. The total of public expenditure for 1969-70 and 1970-71 shown in all the tablesis the sum of the individual programmes atoutturn prices revalued to 1971-72 outturn prices by the movement in the GDP factor cost price index between 1969-70 and 1970-71respectively and 1971-72. The differencebetween this figure and the sum of the individual programmes at 1971 Survey prices is entered for1969-70 and 1970-71 in the lines &quot;adjustment to 1971-72 outturn prices &quot; and &quot; Relative price effect&quot;.Presentation and interpretation of adjustments16. The composition of the adjustments appliedto the 1971 Survey programmes in the manner described in the preceding section is as follows:

The entries in the line &quot; Adjustment to1971-72 outturn prices&quot; in the tables showingthe Cmnd. 4578 estimates revalued to 1971Survey prices have been calculated by applying to the revalued programme estimates the move-ment from 1971 Survey prices to 1971-72 outturn prices assumed for the purpose of converting the1971 Survey estimates from 1971 Survey prices to 1971-72 outturn prices. The entries in theline &quot; Relative price effect&quot; have been calculatedfrom the Cmnd. 4578 estimates revalued to 1971Survey prices by the application of the pricerelativities underlying the calculation of the rela-tive price effect in that White Paper. Theseentries include the adjustment of cash pro-grammes to 1971-72 outturn prices, using thesame movement in the GDP factor cost price index as was assumed for the similar calculationsin Cmnd. 4578. The resulting estimates,distinguishing the adjustment of cash programmesfrom the relative price effect, are:TABLE 3.2Adjustments to Cmnd. 4578 programmes, 1970-71 to 1974-75  million		1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75		estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate.

The effect of this treatment is to ensure thatthe various adjustments differ from those appliedto the 1971 Survey estimates only in respect ofany changes between the Cmnd. 4578 pro-gramme estimates revalued to 1971 Survey prices and the 1971 Survey estimates of the programmes.This will be apparent from a comparison of thefigures in Table 3.1 with those in Table 3.2.19. Since the relative price effect has beenmeasured on the basis of the trend over a numberof years, the actual relative price effect experi-experienced in any particular year may diverge fromthe estimate. The untypical behaviour of pay and prices generally since towards the end of1969 has created conditions in which divergencemay be particularly marked: the Budget fore-casts suggest that public sector prices will movebetween 1970-71 and 1971-72 by about 1-5 percent less in relation to prices generallythan was implied in the Cmnd. 4578calculation of the relative price effect. If thisdivergence from Cmnd. 4578 occurs, and if it isalso assumed that public sector prices generallydo not subsequently tend to catch up with the expectations of Cmnd. 4578, that White Paper
Part Three: MethodologyCONFIDENTIALwill have been shown to have overestimated thedemand on resources of public expenditure from1971-72 onwards by about 1-5 per cent. Ineffect, however, by using Budget forecasts of thisyear&apos;s price levels the 1971 Budget measures havealready taken account of the overestimation inrelation to 1971-72; and for the years beyond1971-72, to the extent that 1971-72 proves tohave diverged from trend, only examination in successive future Surveys will show whether therehas been permanent divergence or whether asseems inherently more likely and as this Reportassumes there will be reversion to trend.Price   adjustment   of   individual   programmes20. The relative price effect and the adjust-ments to 1971-72 outturn prices are, in general,presented as aggregate figures in the tables ofthe Main Report. The underlying calculationsare however based on the figures for individual programmes and it is accordingly possible to allocate to each programme the appropriate rela-tive price effect and adjustments to 1971-72outturn prices. This has been done in Tables5 and 7.21. The adjustments to outturn prices and therelative price effect are less accurate in relationto individual programmes than are the overalladjustments in relation to total public expendi-ture. The rates of growth for some programmes,with adjustments attributed, may be higher orlower than the rates of growth for the unadjustedprogrammes, depending on the composition ofthe individual programme concerned.Classification by resource category22. In order to give a broad indication of theeconomic impact of different types of public expenditure, the relevant transactions are set outin Table 7 of the Main Report in three categories:(a) Net expenditure on resources.(6) Transfers, etc.(c) Net purchase of existing assets.The allocation of expenditure to each group isset out below in terms of the economic classifi-cation used in the national income statistics:(a) Net expenditure on resources:1.  Current  expenditure  on  goods  and services  (other  than  imputed  rent),gross of charges.2.  Gross domestic fixed capital formation,excluding  transactions   in  land  and existing buildings.3.  Current and capital grants to privatenon-profit making bodies.4.  Current grants to persons (education,health and research councils).5.  Capital grants to persons.6.  Net expenditure abroad current grants,debt  interest  and  net  lending lessreceipts of interest.Deduct7. Charges and sales normally offset to current expenditure on goods and services (including charges for school meals and milk and welfare foods).(b) Transfers, etc.:1.   Subsidies.2. Current grants to persons (except undereducation, health and research councils).3.  Capital grants to companies.4. Debt interest, excluding paymentsabroad.(c) Net purchase of existing assets:1. Purchases less sales of land and existing buildings.2.  Net lending to the private sector.3.   Cash expenditure on company securities(net).Classification and other changes since Cmnd.457823. The programme classification adopted in the summary tables in the Main Report follows that used in Cmnd. 4578 but takes account of variousmachinery of government changes which are described in the relevant sections of Part Oneof the Appendix.   The principal transfers are:(a) Civil aviation services and shipping services from &quot; Surface transport&quot; to &quot; Trade,industry and employment&quot;.(b) Child care (England and Wales) and social work (Scotland) from &quot; Law and order&quot;to &quot; Health and personal social services &quot;.(c) Education of mentally handicapped children from &quot; Health and personal social services &quot; to &quot; Education &quot;.24. The following items of public expenditure,which were omitted from Cmnd. 4578 and fromprevious Surveys, have been included in thisSurvey:(a) Capital expenditure by Cable and WirelessLimited.(b) Capital expenditure by the Bank ofEngland.(c) Local authority net lending for councilhouse purchase by council tenants.(d) Local authority expenditure under section56 of the Local Government Act 1958.(e) Local authority expenditure on conces-commisionary fares.
In comparisons between Cmnd. 4578 (revalued)and this Survey, the figures in Cmnd. 4578 havebeen adjusted to take account of these additionalitems.Average annual percentage changes in expendi-tnre25. Tables 5 and 6 show the average annualpercentage changes in expenditure on eachprogramme for the period 1971-72 to 1974-75.This period has been chosen in preference to 1970-71 to 1974-75 in order to avoid a possible distortion in the comparisons.The difference to be assumed on a trend basis for future years between the relative increase in wages and salaries in the whole economy andthat of the GDP factor cost price index may beexpected to be reasonably stable. But for thecorresponding comparison relating to a past year, in this Survey, 1970-71, the actual move-ments of pay in the particular service need tobe compared with the actual movement of theGDP factor cost price index; and as the incidenceand timing of pay increases in the public sectoris not uniform, this comparison may be markedlydifferent from one year to another. For thisreason 1970-71 has been excluded from the cal-speculation of the average annual percentagechanges.26. In all tables showing average annual per-centage rates of change in expenditure investment grants have been excluded from the calculation of the rates.CONFIDENTIAL21
