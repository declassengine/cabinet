THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 5113th April 1971CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME - 1971-72 session memorandum by the Lord President of the council. The Ministerial Committee on Future Legislative have now considered the proposals put fcrwai^d by Departments for legislation during the 1971-72 Session in the light of the discussion in Cabinet on  and 9 February (CM(7l) 8th Conclusions, Minute 8, and 9th Conclusions,Minute 5).2. We clearly have to plan on the assumption that we shall be joining the European Communitieso    That is likely to involve two Bills, aehortone containing the constitutional provisions which will have its committee stage on the Floor and a very long Bill containing the detail which will betaken Upstairsj their timing will depend on the progress of negotiations.In addition we are committed to Bills on Value Added Tax aad on LocalGo ye rnment JFlef or m (separate Bills for England and Wales) and we musthave Housing Finance (with a separate Bill for Scotland) if we are torealise the expected savings in public expenditure,3. This represents an extremely heavy crop of major legislation,which will make unusually heavy demands on time on the Floor and in committee and on the draftsmen.    If we are not to run into serious troubleas a result of overstraining our resources, we must redress the balance by reducing the weight of the rest of the programme.    Bearing in mind theneed to retain as much freedom of manoeuvre as possible in view of the uncertainties about Europe it would be wise to concentrate on relativelylightweight Bills, while maintaining a substantial reserve list of Bills tobe prepared as opportunity offers.    These are the principles on which theCommittee have proceeded.DETAILS OF THE programme, The details of the programme which we recommend are set out in annex A under the following headings and arranged under Departments,Essential Bills - that is Bills required by a specific date, egbecause existing powers expireContingent Bills - Bills which may become essential in this senseMain Pro gramme BillsCOPY NOS2
B.r%l.a in ReserveBills for Scottish Grand CommitteeBills for Second Reading Committee procedureBills suitable for Private MembersAnnex B lists the suggested Bills for which we can find no place in theprogramme.5.        Essential and Contingent, Bills..    The lists include all the itemssuggested by Departments; legislation on entry into Europe comes in thelatter category.    There are more contingent Bills than usual, but manywill not materialise; in particular there is not likely to be a need for substantial legislation next Session on Channel Tunnel,6. Main Programme.    This includes the major Bills on Value AddedTaxj on Local Government Reform and on Housing, Finance to which I have referred and also substantial measures on Monopolies and Mergers,Criminal Justice, Commercial R.adio and Public Sector Superannuation;but in general we have thought it best to give preference to shorter Bills.We have not felt able at this stage to find room for Minerals, which wouldbe a complex Bill on a difficult subject, but have included a short Bill onMining Grants.7. Bills in Reserve.    We have deliberately made the list longer than usual in the interests of flexibility.    The most important item is national health Service Unification which I promised the Cabinet I would try to accommodate, though it could not command the same priority as the other major Bills,8.        Second Readiag Committee Bills0    The use of this procedure foruncontroversial Bills is to be encouraged and we have included a numberof the shorter measures proposed,.    It may not be possible to prepare andpass them all.9.        Bills for Private Members,    I have shown here all the Billsproposed which seem suitable for handing to Private Members, as wellas one or two which were suggested during the discussions in future legislation Committee.    I would welcome further suggestions.10.       In inviting my colleagues to approve this programme I shouldmake clear that it will place a considerable strain on the legislativecapacity of Parliament.    When in Opposition we liked to criticise thelast Administration for introducing too much legislation, but if this programme is implemented we shall have been responsible for twoof the heaviest Sessions on record,W w privy Council Office SW113th April 1971
