INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION:CONVENTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for employment. The constitution of the International Labour Organisation requiresus to bring International Labour Conventions and Recommendations beforeParliament within 12 months of their adoption by the International LabourConference.    This is traditionally done by a White Paper which also sets out the Governments attitude to the instruments in question.    I nowenclose a White Paper dealing with Conventions Nos. 131 and 132 andRecommendations Nos. 135 and 136, which were adopted by the InternationalLabour Conference in June 1970.    The draft has been prepared in full consultation between my Department and others concerned.2. As my colleagues will see from the opening paragraph, the texts ofthe instruments are to be set out in the Annex to the White Paper. As the texts are somewhat lengthy, I am not circulating them with this paper, butthey are available to any of my colleagues who wish to see them.3. Convention No. 131 and Recommendation No. 135 concern minimum wage fixing.    They are specially directed at developing countries and hardlyappropriate to the present circumstances in the United Kingdom, and theGovernment do not propose to ratify the Convention or to accept theRecommendation.4. Convention No. 132 revises a Convention on annual holidays with payadopted in 1936.    We meet its requirements to an appreciable extent, butare precluded from ratifying because, like the previous Convention, it doesnot permit individually negotiated holiday arrangements.5.        Recommendation No, 136 is mainly intended for developing countries and its formal acceptance by the Government is therefore unnecessary.6. If my colleagues agree, 1 propose to publish the enclosed draft assoon as possible.    I should be grateful for any comments not later thanFriday 11 June,    I do not expect the document to prove in any waycontroversial.R department of Employment SW17 June 1971CP(7lj 67 COPY NO     607 June 1971CABINET
(confidential)INTERNATIONAL LABOUR conference the decisions of Ker Majesty&apos;s Government on two conventions and two Recommendations adopted by the International LabourConference at  its $kth. Session in 1970 are set out below.    the texts of the instruments are set out in the annex to this paper.CONVENTION NO 131 AND RECOMMENDATION NO 135 CONCERNING minimum wage FIXING,  WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO DEVELOPING countries the Convention complements  existing instruments protectingdisadvantaged groups of wage earners and pays special regard tothe needs of developing countries.    It requires ratifyingcountries to establish, a system of minimum wages and to createmachinery whereby minimum rates of wages can be fixed andperiodically adjusted.    The groups of wage earners to bocovered are all  those whose terms of employment are such thatcoverage would be appropriate,  and are to be determined afterconsultation with representative organisations of employersand workers.    Ratifying States must notify the ILO of allgroups not  covered giving reasons for their exclusion.It is left to ratifying countries to decide for themselves the nature and form of the wage fixing machinery but theConvention specifies that representatives of employers and workers shall be consulted in connection with its establishment,   operation and modification.    Provision is also made for their direct participation in its operation whereverthis is appropriate to the nature of such machinery.The Convention further requires that minimum wages shallbe binding on the parties concerned;     shall be enforced by appropriate measures such as adequate inspection;     and shallnot be subject to abatement.    Provision is made for appropriatepenalties to be imposed in cases of non-compliance.    So far asis consistent with national practice,  ratifying countries arerequired,   in determining the level of minimum wages,  to payregard both to the needs of workers and their families and to continue factors,   such as the requirements of economic development,  levels of productivity and the desirability ofattaining and maintaining a high level of employment.The Convention is specially directed at the situation in developing countries  and its provisions are less appropriate toindustrialised countries with a long tradition of relying on voluntary collective bargaining for wage determination.    Whilst,therefore,  law and practice in the United Kingdom in relation tothe sectors covered by statutory minimum wage fixing conform with the requirements of the Convention,   the proportion of wage earners in these sectors is small and ratification of an instrument which appears to envisage a wide coverage would hardly be appropriate.
(confidential)The Recommendation prescribes certain additionalconsiderations relating to the principles of minimum wagefixing.    It specifies that wage earners not covered by-Article 1 of the Convention should be kept to a minimum,gives guidance on the manner in which a minimum wage systemmay be applied and suggests various forms that minimum wagefixing machinery might take-    Provision is made for suitablyqualified independent xoersons and,   if such exist,representatives of officially appointed bodies which eitheradvise on or decide minimum wage questions to participate in the operation of such machinery.The Recommendation details various matters that should betaken into account in determining and revising the level of minimum wages.    To this end it recommends that sufficientresources  should be devoted to analytical  studies andperiodic reviews of the relevant factors.    Finally,  theRecommendation suggests a number of measures to ensure the effective application of all provisions relating to minimumwages.In the United Kingdom the national practice is that matters to be taken into account in determining and adjusting minimum wage rates dealt with in paragraphs 3)   H and 12 of theRecommendation should be at the complete discretion of thestatutory wage fixing authorities.     In these circumstances the Government  cannot accept an obligation to specify factors which these authorities should take into consideration.    Apartfrom this,  the Government cannot accept that the attainment of maximum coverage by statutory wage fixing machinery is appropriate to the present circumstances in the United Kingdomand,  whilst recognising the potential value of theRecommendation for developing countries do not accept it for application in the United Kingdom.CONVENTION NO  132 CONCERNING ANNUAL HOLIDAYS WITH PAY(REVISED  1970)The Convention revises the Holidays with Pay Convention,1936,   and the Holidays with Pay (Agriculture)  Convention,  1952,but does not close the latter to further ratification.    it applies to all  employed persons,   other than seafarers,  but thecompetent authority may,  after consultation with organisations of employers and workers  concerned,   exclxide from its application limited categories whose employment gives rise to substantial  enforcement,  legislative or constitutionalproblems.    Each Member may accept the obligations imposed bythe Convention separately in respect of those employed inagriculture and those employed otherwise.    The Convention givesto employed persons the right to an annual holiday with normalor average pay,   of at least three working weeks,   excludingpublic and customary holidays,   or of proportionate length ifthey have less than a complete year1s  service.    Agreements to relinquish the right to a full holiday entitlement or to forego such a holiday,   for compensation or otherwise,  are not allowed.
(confidential)A qualifying period of service,  not  exceeding six months,may be required.     The holiday entitlement on termination ofemployment of any worker satisfying this requirement must beproportionate to the service for which he has not been given aholiday.    Unless fixed by some method consistent with nationalpractice the holiday shall be taken at a time to be determinedby the employer after consultation with the worker or hisrepresentatives.    Payment for the holiday is to be made inadvance,  unless otherwise agreed.Paid annual holiday may be taken in parts.     Subject to completion of the requisite period of service,   and unless otherwise provided for in an agreement,   one of the parts sliallconsist of not less than two uninterrupted weeks.    Theuninterrupted portion is to be taken within one year and theremainder within eighteen months of the end of the year inwhich the holiday is earned.    This period can be extended byagreement in respect of any part of the holiday that  exceedsa stated minimum within limits to be determined by thecompetent  authority.Other provisions deal with detailed matters,   some of whichare the  subject of specific requirements,  while others are left for determination by the  competent  authority or  according to national practice.     These matters include the calculation ofthe qualifying period and of length of service for the purposeof holiday entitlement;     the exclusion from the minimum annual holiday with pay of certain absences from work;     the laying down of special rules in respect of workers who undertake gainfulactivity during the holiday;     the calculation of holiday pay;and the provision of effective  enforcement measures.In the United Kingdom in recent years there has been asubstantial increase in the amount of paid holidays which workersenjoy and the present position is already to an appreciable extent in conformity with the requirements of the Convention;but not all  employed persons  enjoy three weeks&apos;  holiday with pay,  and in matters of detail practice varies from industry to industry and in some cases may not fully conform to theConvention&apos;s requirements^    The Convention stipulates that its provisions must be given effect by national laws or regulationswhere this is not  done by means of collective agreements,arbitration awards,   court decisions,   statutory wage-fixingmachinery or otherwise.    The Government believe that  employersand unions should be free to determine wages,  hours and other similar conditions of work,  including holidays with pay,without detailed statutory intervention,   in the light of the differing social  and economic circumstances of the industries concerned.VZhile fully supporting the principle of adequate holidayswith pay,  and welcoming the progress in this field which hasrendered the previous Convention out of date,  the government cannot,   for the reason indicated,  ratify the Convention.
(confidential)RECOMMENDATION NO  I36  CONCERNING SPECIAL YOUTH EMPLOYMENT ANDTRAINING SCHEMES FOR DEVELOPMENT purposes the Recommendation seeks to establish guidelines for theestablishment  and operation of special  schemes designed to mobilise young people for work towards national development.Such schemes have been developed by a number of countries tomeet the problem,   critical in some cases,  of youthunemployment.     Broadly speaking,   special  schemes may be divided into two categories:   (a)  those which emphasise training and productive employment for unskilled,  unemployed youth;and (b)  those which emphasise service to the community byeducated youth..     They are  &quot;special&quot; because they attempt tomeet needs not being met by other types of programme and because participation in them differs from both a normalemployment relationship and from traditional vocational training and education.The Ftecommendation is mainly intended for developing countries and does not relate to conditions in the UnitedKingdom where the existing complex of measures  directed towards the  development of economic and human resourcesembraces adequate provisions  for the education,  training andemployment  of youth.     Its formal  acceptance by the Governmentis not  therefore necessary.    The Government,  however,  endorse the principles set cut in the Recommendation which providesvaluable guidance on the manner in which special youthemployment  and training  schemes  should be developed and onthe elements they should contain.5 May 1971
