THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC majesty&apos;s government cp(71) 65 COPY NO      gg25 May 1971CABINETGAS AND ELECTRICITY prices note by the Central Policy R.eview staff, The proposals by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry inhis memorandum CP(7l) 64 for increases in gas and electricity pricesraise important questions of Government strategy in relation to economic policy and policy towards the nationalised industries.2.        It can be argued that these proposals are too drastic and theproposed increases excessive because:a. In the present inflationary situation the Government shouldbe seen to resist price increases which are within its control,b. They will put up costs and prices and may be used asarguments for further wage and price increases.c. They would be hard on pensioners and very poor families.3. These may be cogent arguments in the short term., but they imply that the Government should direct the industries to sell gas and electricityat uneconomic prices.    To do so would run counter to the governments general strategy because:a. It introduces new distortions into the price mechanismwhereas it is a general objective of Government to remove suchdistortions.b. It will make it impossible for the industries concerned tomeet their financial objectives: this may well prejudice thegeneral policy of managing the nationalised industries by broadobjectives and not by detailed interference.
ca      It will reduce the contributions which the gas and electricity industries can make to financing their own investment.    This willcreate large extra claims on the National Loans Fund and thusprejudice the Governments objectives in the whole field of public expenditure and public sector finance.d0      So far as electricity is concerned^ selling it at present prices will stimulate electricity consumption.    If the additional demand isto be met, a large amount of additional and uneconomic investment is likely to be required, which would further prejudice theGovernments public expenditure objectives,4, Unless the Government accepts uneconomically low rates of return in the gas and electricity industries as a permanent feature of its policy, which would be contrary to all its stated objectives,postponing or reducing the proposed increases will not help the inflationpr obi era.    Smaller increases now will simply mean larger increases later.5. The effects on pensioners and very poor families need to be looked at in the light of social security provision,6. The proposed increases are the minimum required to achieveacceptable financial objectives in the gas and electricity industries,recommendation. The Central Policy Review Staff therefore recommends they be approved as they stand,Cabinet Office SW124 May 1971
