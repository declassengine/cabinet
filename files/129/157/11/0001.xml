CABINETSERVICES FOR THE MENTALLY HANDICAPPEDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Servicesand the Secretary of State for WalesL We seek our colleagues&apos; agreement to publishing as a command paper the draft Paper which is circulated with this memorandum,    Ashort summary is also annexed.    Publication of the Paper was agreedto by the Social Services Committee on 14 May with the proviso thatthe 1971 work of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee could not beanticipated and the achievement of particular standards could not be related to a specific timetable.2. We see merit in. the suggestion also made by the Social services committee of producing in addition a shorter and simplified document butdo not think it wculd be appropriate to hold up publication of the command paper while this is drafted.3. The Governments intention to publish a policy document on thissubject has been mentioned in Parliament several times since we took office - most recently in reply to a Question on 6 April of which a copy is attached (Hansard, Vol. 815, cols. 233-35).4. Hospital and local authority services for the mentally handicappedare a priority area for improvement, and are to receive a large share ofthe extra resources allocated last autumn to the health and personal social services for the next four years.5. Much of the ground work for this Paper was done under the previous government as acknowledged in the Foreword.    The policy described in itis not politically controvei sial4    In essence it is not adoption of a basicallynew policy but rather that faster progress should be made towards the objectives outlined by the Royal Commission in 1957: a service in whichthe hospital and local authority social service elements are planned jointlyand play complementary parts, in which the hospital service willincreasingly divest itself of responsibilities for those requiring careon social grounds and concentrate on the treatment and nursing of those with the most severe handicaps.    An important feature is that, for the1CP(71) 61 COPY NO20 May 1971
first time, local authorities are given quantitative (although highly-provisional) targets for the scale on which various kinds of service should be provided.    The policy ha.s been generally welcomed by thelocal authority associations,, hospital boards and professional organisationswe have consulted about the main points made in the Paper.    It has alsobeen endorsed by our Standing Mental Health Advisory Committeec6, The extra resources we allocated last autumn for the years to1974-75 have made it possible for us to improve on the previousGovernments provisional allocations for 1971-72 (financial allocations to hospital authorities and loan sanctions and rate support grant for localauthorities), and to describe firm programmes to 1974-75.    The Paper(Chapter 6) also discusses the further expenditure needed to bring these services to an acceptable, standard and suggests rates of expenditure which  /ould achieve this throughout the country in 15-20 years.7.        In our view this rate of progress is not adequate, and may be criticised.    We have, however, tailored it to match the decisions on public expenditure plans up to 1974-75 made by the Government last yearand not to prejudice future decisions concerning the growth of public expenditure on the health and personal social services in these and later years.    We are strongly of the opinion that publication of the Paper shouldnot be delayed, and accept that, because of the priority we attach to the improvements cf these services, its publication will not of itself preclude the health and personal social services from making their contribution toany savings which may be found necessary as a result of the reviews in1971 or later years of the prospects for public expenditure as a whole,8,        In spite of the possible criticism of rate of progress, v/e expect the Paper to be widely welcomed.9o        We would be glad to know by 28 May if any of our colleagues see any objection to publication.K JP t department of Health and Social Security SE119 May 1971

FOREWORD BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR social services AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WALESMuch of  the groundwork for  this Paper was done under  theprevious Government,  who also  launched  in 1969 a new driveto improve hospital  services  for  the mentally handicapped.We acknowledge  the work which  they  initiated.    But  their plans to finance  these  improvements did not extend beyond1 971 -2.This Paper  reflects   the very substantial   increases  in expenditure  on mental handicap services made possible bythe Governments decision,   referred  to in paragraph 28of  the White Paper   &quot;New Policies  for Public Spending1(Cmnd 4515),   to adjust forward    expenditure plans  toprovide for an additional  110 million over  the years1971/72  to 1974/75  for the health and personal  social services,  particularly for  the  elderly and mentally handicapped,   over  and above  the provision planned by  theprevious  administration.     It also describes  the rate of progress  thereafter which seems practicable on presentassumptions about public  expenditure  in  the  longer  term.1

4-1. There are probably about 120,000 people in England and /vales who areseverely mentally handicapped, of whom about 50,000 are children.     Many more aremildly mentally handicapped.2.  .Vhat does this mean?     v\hat special help is needed for these people andtheir families?     what is done for them at present, and what ought to be done infuture?     ,;hy has this Government, like the previous G-overnment, given special priority to developing services for the mentally handicapped, and what does thisentail?3   This Paper deals with these questions.     Its main objects are:(l)   To explain why the present services need to be extended and improved, andthe shift in emphasis from care in hospital to care in the communityaccelerated.(2)   To invite greater sympathy and tolerance on the part of the public forthe mentally handicapped in their own local communities, and to stress the importance of the help they can give through voluntary services.(3)   To give local authorities and hospital authorities guidance on thelines on which the Government wish their services to develop.(4)   To describe the programmes of improvement   and development   which havebeen started, and what more needs to be done.4, The term &apos;mental handicap&apos; is used throughout this paper.     Various otherterms are used, here and in other countries, with the same meaning.   1 mental deficiency&apos;used to be the statutory term in England and wales and still is inScotland.     In England and Wales the present statutory terms are &apos;subnormality&apos;and &quot;severe subnormality&apos;, which together cover the conditions for which the term&apos;mental handicap1 is used in this paper.     The term &apos;mental retardation1 is usedin the United States and has also been adopted by the World Health organisation with the sub-classifications&apos;inild&apos;, ^moderate&apos;,&apos;severe&apos;and &quot;profound1; the last three
of these together are broadly equivalent to the term&apos;severe mental handicap1used inthis paper.     &apos;Mental handicap&apos; is used in preference to any of the alternative termsbecause   this helps to emphasise that our attitude should be the same as to other types of handicap,ie to prevent it whenever possible, to assess it adequately when it occurs, and to do everything possible to ^alleviate its severity and compensate for its effects.5. The description of our present services in Chapter 4 inevitably highlightstheir deficiencies.     It needs to be made clear at the outset that this implies nocriticism of the hospital or local authority staff who are concerned with theday-to-day care of the mentally handicapped in hospital or elsewhere.     On thecontrary,, they, with the mentally handicapped themselves and their families, bear the brunt of these deficiencies.6, The nurses, many working in overcrowded and understaffed hospital wards, are giving devoted personal service to their patients.        We look to them with confidence to improve the quality of their patients&apos; daily life when the means of doing so are put into their hands.5
CHAPTER 1.     MENTALLY HANDICAPPED PEOPLE AND THEIU FiU&apos;lILIESMENTALLY HANDICAPPED CHILDREN AND ADULTSWhat is mental handicap?J        A person who is mentally handicapped does not develop in childhood as quickly as other children nor attain the full mental cppacities of a normal ./ theadult.     The handicap may be slight or severe.     Iir most severe cases,development does not progress even in adult life beyond the mental capacity ofa young child;   such severe handicap is much less common than milder degrees ofhandicap    covering    a wide spectrum ranging up to and merging into the &quot;normal1.Mentally handicapped people have difficulty in understanding, and inadapting themselves to new situationss     They may find it difficult to communicate,or to establish relationships with more than a few people, but they are generallyaffectionate and respond to affectionate treatment as children do.     Many ofthose with severe mental handicap have physical handicaps as well, which are often also severe;    they find it more difficult than other people to compensate for even a minor physical handicap.     Some of the mentally handicapped alsosuffer from mental illness or personality disorders.     But   often      mentalhandicap entails no more than slow and restricted development, uncomplicatedby any other serious disability.______________________________-      ..._________........-......   .....__________What are the causes?In most cases the causes are not known.     Mental handicap can result fromconditions arising before or at birth which affect the functioning of the brain;    someof these are becoming rarer owing to improvement in the maternity services, but more children with very severe handicap are now surviving birth and infancy.     It is oftenthe result of unpredictable and unavoidable factors - hereditary or environmental or both - including the lower end of the normal range of variation of intelligence.In some cases the handicap6
is known to be due to an organic condition, such as a chromosome abnormalityor metabolic disorder;    in a few cases, some of these conditions can now be corrected if identified at an early stage.Effects of other handicaps10 without very careful assessment, some children with disabilities ofhearing, vision or language may be diagnosed as mentally handicapped becauseof their inability to communicate.     Even when such a disability is clearlyrecognised, development may be delayed or in extreme cases permanently restricted,resulting in mental handicap, if the disability cannot be corrected or cured by special education or treatment.     Some forms of physical illness occurring inchildhood may have a permanent effect on mental development and produce mentalhandi cap.jj A child&apos;s capacity to learn and develop may be restricted through   socialdeprivation, particularly if the child or his parents are naturally somewhat belowaverage in intelligence;   such children may improve remarkably if the emotional andintellectual stimulus of which they have been deprived can be provided.Mental illness and mental handicap\2.       Mental handicap is sometimes wrongly confused with mental illness.     mental illness can strike anyone at any age:    it usually responds to treatment and can often be cured.     Mental handicap, on the other hand, is usually determinedbefore or during birth or in the early weeks of life and affects a person&apos;disability to learn and reason.     It cannot be 1 cured&apos; in the same sense as anillness but the development of mentally handicapped people can Often be improved by education, training and social care (and without such helpmay remain unnecessarily restricted).     The physical and emotional disabilitieswhich are often associated with mental handicap may be alleviated with specialmedical , nursing and educational treatment.;1   -t
prospective ts]3 Although the handicapped have a shorter expectation of life than thepopulation as a whole, the majority live well into adult life and many intoold age.     There are many more mentally handicapped adults than children.The severely handicapped never become fully independent but need specialhelp throughout their lives.     Those with milder degrees of handicap needvarying degrees and forms of support.The effect on the familyL &apos;  &apos;    Inevitably the presence of a severely handicapped child or adult causesgreat strain on the family as a whole.     It may affect their whole way of life.1^ First there is the shock to the parents of learning that their child ishandicapped;    if there is also physical abnormality this may be apparent atbirth;    otherwise the mental handicap is usually recognised as the child fails to develop at the normal rate.     The parents then know that they cannot look forward to the gradual lessening of their responsibilities which takes place as a normal child grows to maturity and independence.1^       Because a handicapped child may need for many years as much care and supervision as a very young normal child, it is often difficult for the parentsto maintain an ordinary social life of their own.     They may become isolated and lonely, which can increase the tensions of their family life and affect&apos; theirown mental and physical health.     If the child is physically as well as mentally handicapped, he becomes increasingly difficult&quot;to care for as he grows older;it becomes harderhe can only be left at home if suitable care can be arranged and/for the mother to take him out with her.     Incontinence may be a serious problem.I&quot;),        Other children in the family may suffer if their parents&apos; time andenergy are exhausted by the physical and emotional demands of the handicappedchild.     Family holidays and recreation are difficult to arrange.     Thequality of home life for the whole family may be affected.8
\% , Yet a handicapped child needs the affection and stimulating company which a family normally provides for its children.    Parents are often facedwith acute problems in balancing the needs of a handicapped child with thoseof the rest of the family.jflj As the child grows into an adult these problems do not   necessarily diminish.Indeed if   the handicap is severe, they are&quot;likely to increase.   In addition, the parents become increasingly anxious about what will happen to their child wnenthey cannot care for him any longer.^0, - Most parents are devoted to their handicapped children and wish tocare for them and help them to develop to their full potential.     About BO%of severely handicapped children and kO% of severely handicapped adults - anda higher proportion of the more mildly handicapped - live at home.     their families need advice and many forms of help, most of which at present are rarelyavailable.9
CHAPTER 2. NUMBERSSURVEYS TO PROVIDE INFORMATIONWe do not know precisely the prevalence of mental handicap, nor the numberof mentally handicapped people who require particular forms of help.     Betterinformation is needed, and is being obtained through surveys financed by theDepartment of Health and Social Security;    some of their findings are already available.Purpose of surveys22 Paragraph    T  gjcplains why precise estimates of prevalence are never likelyto be obtained.    For practical purposes    these are not important.     what we need is a reasonable basis for estimating the numbers of people for whomdifferent types of services are likely to be required.     Such estimates will provideplanning targets, and their adequacy can be tested by experience of thecalls made on the services as they develop.     It is easier - and perhaps moreimportant - to make such estimates in relation to people with severe mentalhandicap, than of those with milder handicap.    The severely handicapped even whenadult can rafcely live independently;   they and their families require specialhelp not only while they are children but throughout their lives.Information recorded by surveys.2?. Three surveys have been carried out during the last few years, in the Wessexand Newcastle hospital regions and in the former metropolitan borough ofCamberwell.     They have recorded the number of people known to be receiving, onaccount of mental handicap, any form of health or personal social services from public authorities or in registered mental nursing homes or residential homes, andthose known to need any such service but not to be receiving it.    The numbers havebeen analysed by age, by the degree of mental handicap (measured by the intelligencequotient), by type and degree of certain physical and behaviour difficulties, andaccording to whether the handicapped people are living at home or elsewhere.&apos;10
2 4^  Table 1 summarises the result of the surveys in relation to people classified as having severe mental handicap, wherever resident;   it also gives the numbersclassified as having mild handicap who, when the surveys were made, were in hospital or other residential care.     For the reasons explained below, the figures,even for severe handicap, should be interpreted as broad indications rather thanprecise findings. Table 1 to be printed here/25.   The surveys also recorded other associated physical disabilities besidesthose mentioned in the Table.    The Wessex survey found that among severelymentally handicapped children in hospital in that region 1 in 3 also suffered fromepilepsy, 1 in 5 had defects of vision or hearing, and 1 in 20 were blind;     amongthe severely mentally handicapped adults in hospital 1 in 5 suffered fromepilepsy, 1 in 5 had defects of vision or hearing, and almost 1 in 3 had speechdefects.Severe mental handicap2 6X   An intelligence quotient of 50 is commonly taken as a broad dividing line between mild and severe handicap (though such a division is of little practical importance to people near either side of it).   The intelligence quotient as measured by t sts of various kinds is not a precise measure of a person1s ability, and canchange quite substantially during life. Mental handicap is not to be measured in termsof intelligence alone;   emotional development is also relevant. Nevertheless, the intelligence quotient has less subjective errors than other criteria, and is a usefulindicator.   The three surveys used IQ 50 either as their sole criterion or as one oftheir criteria, in distinguishing the two categories of mild or severe handicap.2 7.   It is generally believed that by the end of adolescence nearly all people with severe mental handicap are known to the hospital or local authorities, becauseduring school or in the early years of employment,they will have been identified/      age  . if not earlier /  The survey findings forsevere mental handicap in the 15-19 age group are therefore likely to be close tothe true total.    The findings of these three surveys are in broad agreement with others conducted elsewhere in Great Britain and Northern Ireland in indicating aprevalence of about 4 severely mentally handicapped per 1,000 population in thisage group.11

2 8,   As severe mental handicap is generally present at birth, the prevalence ratein children must be at least as high as in adolescents.     The surveys recordedlower rates.     This indicates that many young children with such handicap are not known to the public services.2 9.   As age increases, the proportion of the population with severe mentalhandicap falls because they do not live as long as the population as a whole.This is the reason why it is estimated that total present numbers with severe mentalhandicap are probably about 120,000 (between 2 and 3 per 1,000 population,compared with 4 per 1,000 at age 15-19).     There is however evidence that the rateof survival is increasing.Mild mental handicapJO       . Mild mental handicap covers a wide range from the borderline with severehandicap to the borderline with people whose intelligence is below normal but to whom this does not present a significant handicap.     There is nomeasurable dividing line at the upper end of the range,J Many   people who have an intelligence quotient aboue about50 but below the normal range are not materially affected by this      ^d can leadordinary lives. others in this IQ range are unable to cope with the problems of living in society;   they maythen regarded as mildly mentally handicapped and eligible for help from the localauthority or hospital mental health services.     These include some young people who may have been classified as educationally subnormal while at school./ such people may have difficulty- In adolescence&apos;in finding and keeping employment and adjusting to therequirements of adult life;   at that stage they may need help from the mental health services but later manage without further support.!Q,        The number of such people who need such help is also related to the social conditions in which they live, educational services and opportunities for employment.Moreover the number seeking help, and therefore known to the authorities and through13
in hospital and in residential homes in the community, the Department of health anaSocial Security and Welsh Office arranged for two censuses, in 1970.3      The first census was carried out by local authorities on 30 April 1970   and theinformation was sent to the central Departments for analysis.    It covered allmentally handicapped people in local authority and voluntary homes in England andWales.    The information oolleoted included the number of residents and thecharacter of their mental and physical handicaps and degree of social dependence.This census is to be extended this year, in a modified form, to private homes forthe mentally handicapped.&apos;$], The second was a census of all mentally handicapped patients in hospitals inEngland and Wales on 31 December 1970.    It covered not only patients in hospitalsthem to the surveys, depends partly on the services available locally, and these varywidely from one area to another.&apos;S^.   For all these reasons we are never likely to obtain precise estimates ofprevalence of mild mental handicap.     It is difficult even to estimate the numbersrequiring services except through experience of the use made of services actuallyprovided.     As the services are still at an early stage of development in mostareas, such experience is not yet available.^ Table 1 includes information from the surveys about the mildly mentally handicapped who are in hospital or other residential care, but does not givefigures for those living at home.     The reason for this is that those in hospital or other residential oare are all known to the authorities, and the numbers arelikely to be near the total of those requiring residential care of one sort or another.    Those living at home are not all known to the authorities, for thereasons mentioned in paragraphs 29    to 33    ^ the numbers recorded in. the surveysvariedwidely and do not form a useful basis for estimating service   needs.National Censuses of the mentally hand!capped in hospital and in other^residential accommodation^C! In order to obtain detailed information about mentally handicapped people now
for the mentally handioapped but also mentally handicapped patients in otherhospitals in the National Health Servioe and in hospitals or nursing homes outsidethe National Health Servioe who are being cared for under contract with a regional Hospital BoaixL.    It recorded, among other information, the number ofsuch patients and the character of their handioaps.     Similar information is beingcollected about all mentally handicapped patients admitted from 1 January 1971onwardSoThe information from these two censuses is now being analysed.    It willprovide a further check on the findings of the surveys   on questions which werecovered both by the surveys and by the censuses, and new information on other questions.    This should be of considerable value in planning services for thefuture.15
CHAPTER 3.   GENERAL PRINCIPLESChapter 4 describes the state of our present services for mental handicap.Chapters 5 and 6 discuss in detail present views on the services required and how they should be organised.   Chapter 7 discusses the important role of voluntary services.    The main principles on which current thinking about mental handicapis based need first to be stated.4.0   These can be summarised as follows:-(i) A family with a handicapped member has the same needs for generalsocial services as all other families.   They and the handicapped child or adult also need special additional help, which varies according tothe severity of the handicap, whether there are associated physicalhandicaps or behaviour problems, the age of the handicapped person andhis family situation.(ii) Mentally handicapped children and adults should not be segregatedunnecessarily from other people of similar age, nor from the generallife of the local community,(iii) Full use should be made of available knowledge which can help toprevent mental handicap or to reduce the severity of its effects.(iv) There should be a comprehensive initial assessment and periodicreassessment of the needs of each handicapped person and his family.(v) Each handicapped person needs stimulation, social training and education and purposeful occupation or employment in order to developto his maximum capacity and to exercise all the skills he acquires,however limited they may be.(vi) Each handicapped person should live with his own family as long asanthis does not impose/undue    burden on him or them, and he and his family should receive full advice and support.   If he has to leave home for aC0 NFS life NTfAl

CHAPTER 4.     THE SERVICES TODAYHISTORICAL BACKGROUND4.1* Although the first Mental Deficiency Act was passed in 1913, its implementationon any scale was delayed by the war of 1914-18.    The foundations of our presentservices were laid in the 1920s and 1930s.    Attitudes to the mentally handicapped,views on services needed and the statutory responsibilities of public authorities were then very different from those underlying the principles which are now generally accepted and are summarised in Chapter 3.Segregation of the mentally handicapped4 2,   Although there have always been more mentally handicapped people livingwith their families than anywhere else, it was thought best in those days thatthose who could not be cared for at home should be segregated from the rest of society in institutions - or &quot;colonies&quot; as they were often called.     Evenamong those who lived at home many of the severely handicapped were hiddenaway by their families, and few mixed socially with their neighbours.4 3^   Most of the institutions or colonies were in the country, some distance from the towns, and were run as self-sufficient enclosed communities.     Mostof their inmates, once admitted, remained for life.     This was considered tobe in their best interests, to provide a sheltered environment in whichcomprehensive care was available for the mildly as well as the seriouslyhandicapped, segregated from the rest of society.     Less was known then than now about the extent to which the mentally handicapped may respond to the stimulusof education, training and social activity.Responsibilities of local authorities before 19484 4,   Until 1948, local authorities (counties and county boroughs) were responsible for all aspects of the care of the mentally handicapped.   They hada duty to provide &quot;supervision&quot; and training or occupation for those notliving in institutions, and institutions for those who could not be cared foreoNFSPlNTIAL
Institutions for social as well as medical need45,   The inmates of the institutions included not only those with severemental handicap, but also people with mild handicap who were &quot;without visiblemeans of support or cruelly treated&quot;, or &quot;in need of care and training whichcould not be provided in his home&quot; or requiring &quot;supervision&quot; after leavingschool.     Many of these helped run the institutions as domestics, laundryworkers, kitchen helps and gardeners,.     Their work contributed significantlyto the care of the severely handicapped.46,   The institutions thus served a social welfare as well as a medicalpurpose. The Superintendent was usually a doctor, and most of the staffcaring for the inmates were &quot;attendants1 and later nurses (helped by other inmates).Changes in 19484 7,   When the National Health Service started in 1948 these institutionswere transferred to the new hospital authorities.    At that time the accommodation in the former public assistance institutions, which had also previously performedboth social welfare and medical functions, was divided between the new hospital authorities and the local authorities who remained responsible for providingresidential accommodation for the elderly.    But there was no similarapportionment of accommodation in thenental deficiency institutions, whichall became &quot;hospitals&quot;.    Local authorities continued to have a duty toprovide services for the mentally handicapped living at home, but ceased to provide residential accommodation.    The hospitals continued to admit the mentally handicapped who needed residential care on either social ormedical grounds.4 8,   Within the hospital and local authority service the mentally handicappedcontinued, generally speaking, to be segregated.     For example, while the localauthorities&apos; new children1s departments might receive mentally handicapped childreninto care if the relevant criteria were satisfied (drawing on health and education services as a parent would), it was usual for all care for severely mentally handicapped children outside hospital to be provided by the mental health department;
if residential^care was needed the child was&apos; &apos; a6put on the waiting list for admission to hospital.     The hospitals continued,in most areas, to have few links with other parts of the new hospital service,and most of them had their own separate   Hospital Management Committees.The Royal commission of 1954-57Emphasis- on community care and end of segregation4 9    These arrangements were reviewed by the Royal Commission which reportedin 1957*.     It recommended radical changes with a new emphasis on communitycare and breaking down segregation.The Commission1s general approach was very similar to presentthinking as reflected in the principles summarised in Chapter 3*     Itrecommended that all the general social services should be available to the mentally handicapped as well as others   and that mental health services shouldbe fully integrated with other health and welfare services.    hospitals should be responsible only for those requiring specialist medical treatmentor training or continual nursing supervision;   out-patient services shouldbe provided.     Local authorities should provide small residential homes orhostels for adults and children who cannot remain at home but do not need tobe in hospital;   these should not be isolated but in centres of population,and the residents should take part in the life of the local community.More training centres should be provided for children and adults in the community,more sheltered workshops and more social support for the mentally handicappedand their families.*Report of the Royal Commission on the Law relating to Mental Illnessand Mental Deficiency, 1954-57J Cmnd. 169.
These recommendations were accepted by the Government of the day and commended tolocal authorities and hospitals in circulars issued in 1959 and 1960.     Thosewhich required legislation were included in the Mental Health Act 1959.In August 1959 the Minister of Health, by a direction under the National health service Act 1946 and the new Act, laid a duty on the local authorities toprovide a full range of community services for the mentally handicapped,including residential accommodation.        This replaced their previous duties under the Mental Deficiency Acts to provide&quot;supervision&quot;,training and occupation for those not in hospital.New work for local authorities52 &apos;    &apos;  Thus some ten years after they had lost this function, and with it the accommodation they had formerly provided for the purpose, local authoritiesonce more became responsible for   residential care for the mentally handicapped.They were faced with the task not only of building up residentialhomes    from scratch, but also of greatly expanding day services which theyhad formerly provided only on a relatively small scale.Priorities5^&apos;.       A choice had to be made in the use of resources.    Most authorities,rightly, gave first priority in the field of mental handicap   to training facilities;* in this they have made excellent progress. More recentlyand in their present forward planning more attention has been given to residential homes.o       / ut residential /is needed ^ .   ^0%,     /:     accommodation is still far short of what&apos; to absorb   the yearly flow of mentally handicapped people needing residential care outside their ownhomes but not the full medical and nursing service   of a hospital-   For lackof enough local authority homes therefore, and lack of other services whichmight make it possible for their own families to continue to care for them^such people are still pressing upon overcrowded hospital waiting lists.
23^ The strengths and weaknesses of the present community services stem from thishistorical background, and from the priorities adopted by different localauthorities in the face of financial constraints.     Generally speaking, the quality of the new training centres and residential homes provided in the last decade is good, because they are new and conform to modern standards.     But, apart from/centres (now special schools)junior training &apos;        . for children to which most authorities gave first priority,only a small start has been made towards providing in sufficient quantity trainingcentres for mentally handicapped adults, residential care for adults and children,and practical help and advice for families with mentally handicapped members livingat home.6ood new buildings .Q .      Most of the money spent by local authorities on the mentally handicapped inthe past ten years has been used for new training centres or residential homes inpurpose-built or well-adapted buildings;   these provide an excellent environment for services of a high standard.     They do not have the problems of isolation from whichthe hospitals suffer;   these local authority services are in the area where they are needed, easily accessible.     Overcrowding is not a serious problem;   in recentpurpose-built residential homes for mentally handicapped adults the   the  majority ofthe residents have single rooms, and the homes are well furnished.     Running costs are relatively high but reflect a service fully acceptable by modern standards.Schools for childrenSi Until 1 April 1971, when local education authorities became responsible for theeducation of mentally handicapped children, the more severely handicapped were excluded from the educational system.     The training of those living at home was theresponsibility of the local authorities1 health departments;   hospital authorities were responsible for those in hospital.   The change in responsibility is the naturalconsequence of the considerable advances already made by health and hospital authorities in meeting the educational needs of mentally handicapped children.
Numbers- .   In the 1960s, local authorities gave first priority to increasing the numberof junior training centres for mentally handicapped children living at home, toy toreplacing unsatisfactory old buildings and separating the training of children fromthat of adults.     The number of places rose from 12,200 in I96D to 23,500 at theend of 1970.    The number of centres rose to over 700, of which less than 100provided for adults in the same buildings,compared with 458 centres in I96D of which266 also provided for adults.Variations between authorities^ &apos;       But there are still wide variations between authorities and some local shortages.    Some authorities have set their sights high and havealready  reached .       their targets.    But in other areas there are children unable toattend for lack of places, or because their homes are too faraway .: for them to attend unless boarding facilities are provided.    At theend of 1969 about 1,800 children were on waiting lists for places in junior trainingcentres.0 After taking into account the use   made        of centres run by other local/providedauthorities or voluntary organisations, the number of places&apos;at the end of I969 per1,000     population aged 5-14 varied from less than 2    (by 2 authorities) to over7    (by i4 authorities) with a mean of 3.16.   These variations may be connected tecsome extent with where in the past different authorities drew the line betweenspecial schools for children classified as educationally subnormal and theirjunior training centres.general quality&quot;    Nevertheless, the health departments have handed over to the educationdepartments a service which, overall, has improved out of all recognition in thelast decade.
Special care units.Most local health authorities provided &apos;special care units&apos;, usually aspart of a junior training centre, for mentally handicapped children who also had such severe physical handicaps or behaviour disorders that they could not attend a normal class in the centre.   This helps parents to keep at home children who would otherwise need to be admitted to hospital.   At the end of 1969 there were 187 suchunits attached to junior training centres, providing places for about 2,500 children,and 28 separate units with 780 places.   These have now been transferred to the localeducation authorities.   For adults who are unable to benefit from the usual adult training centre programme there are special facilities in a few areas in the formof units for &quot;adult special care&apos; or &apos;pre-vocational training&apos;.ol.        There has been some argument whether, especially for adults, &quot;special care&apos;should be regarded as a function for the local authorities or whether this sort of care should be provided, on a day basis, by hospitals.   Certainly most (but not all)of these children and adults require some specialist medical and nursing attention,together with special services such as speech therapy or physiotherapy to deal withparticular disabilities; the children also need education and the adults further education and training.   There is therefore scope for the development both ofspecial care units by local authorities and of day places in hospitals.   In manycases it will be desirable for hospitals and local authorities to arrange jointprovision of appropriate staff and contributions to the running costs.Training and occupation for adults.Adult training centres provide further training, and in many cases permanentdaily occupation, for mentally handicapped adults who are not able to work in open orsheltered employment.   Although progress has been made in improving and increasingthese, many more places are still needed.6S..      The number of places for adults rose from 10,100 in i960 to 26,400 by the endof 1970, but there are many areas where the increase is still barely sufficient totake in the young people who leave the junior training centres (now special schools)each year.   Older adolescents have to remain in the school or at home until
a place in an adult oentre oan be found.    Many older adults remain at home withouttraining or daily occupation and with little prospect of the opportunity of a place in a training centre.    A survey of 26 adult training centres undertaken in1969 showed that Jl% of those attending were aged 16-20;   39$ were aged 21-30;less than a quarter were over 30.There are wide variations between different local authorities.    After taking into account the use made of centres run by other local authorities or voluntary organisations, the number of places provided at the end of 1969 per 1,000population aged 15-64 varied from 0.4 or less (by 7 authorities) to over 2.0(by 6 authorities) with a mean of only 0.78 places.    This is quite insufficienteven for the adults now living at home or in residential care outside hospital;for this purpose about 1.5 plaoes per 1,000 population aged 15-64 are needed -nearly twice the present number.    The requirement increases as the number ofmentally handicapped adults living in residential care outside hospitalincreases.    For the long term future, when in addition to all these it may also bedesirable for these centres to provide places for substantial numbers of adultscoming by day from the hospitals (as discussed in Chapter 5), a target of 2.4places per 1,000 population in this age-group is suggested.    No authority has yet reached this target and the great majority are very far indeed from even the interimtarget of 1.5 places.Residential care&amp; $2As mentioned in paragraphs and       , in 1959 local authorities were againputunder a duty to provide residential accommodation for the mentally handicapped, but hadto start building this up again from scratch.    They have begun to implement this duty by building (or adapting) residential homes which they run themselves and by placing mentally handioapped people in homes run by other local authorities or by voluntary organisations or private individuals or in private households orsupervised lodgings.26
Gross shortageAt the end of 1969, 24 of the 157 loeal authorities in England and 4 of the 17authorities in Wales still had no arrangements of this sort at all either for children or adults.    Another 64 in England and 9 in Wales had no such arrangementsfor children, and 28 in England and 7 in Wales no arrangements for adults.    61authorities in England and 1 in Wales had no residential homes of their own but had arranged some placements elsewhere.     13 in England and 2 in Wales had one or morehomes of their own for children, hut none for adults..    . 44 inEngland and 6 in Wales had one or more homes of their own for adults but none for children.    Only 39 English authorities and 4 Welsh had provided homes of their ownfor both children and adults.children the total number of places in homes for children in England and Wales at theend of 1969, including use of places in voluntary or private homes, was about 1,800.1,300 of these were in the 68 residential homes run by the authorities themselves,many of which were used as boarding homes, five days a week, by children attendingjunior training centres but living too far away to travel daily.     In additionabout 70 children were placed with private families or foster homes.    The total of1,870 children in residential care arranged by local authorities represents 0.16 per1,000 population aged 0-14.    Chapter 5 suggests that such residential care is needed for &amp;SX per 1,000 in this age group.AdultsFor adults, there were about 4*350 places in residential homes at the end of1969, and 550 placed in private households or lodgings, a total of 4,900 inresidential care arranged by local authorities.    About 3,200 of these were in 151residential homes run by the authorities themselves.    In addition about 1,700mentally handicapped adults under age 65 were unsuitably living in homes for the elderly provided under the National Assistance Act, including former public
assistance institutions.    The total of 4,900 adults in suitable residential carerepresents 0.13 per 1,000 population aged 15 or over.     Chapter 5 suggests thatsuch care is needed for  &quot;f^per 1,000 adults.Present building plansSince the end of 1969, 106 new places for children and 287 new places for adults have been provided in local authority homes, and 183 places for children and 687 for adults are under construction.    But even if local authorities&apos; plans for the next 3 years to March 1974 can be carried out in full, 59 authorities in 1England and 8    in Wales will then still have no homes of their own for mentally handicapped children and 14 authorities in England and 1 in Wales none for adults.
Effect of shortage&quot;12,      .  As the figures show, in many parts of the country facilities for residentialcare outside hospital are still nil or minimal.-jl      -   Lack of experience in providing residential services can result in places inthe few residential homes that exist being used for people who could manage with aleaser degree of support in suitable lodgings.    Places in seme homes may remainempty because they are reserved for a special purpose for which the demand is limited, or which is wrongly thought to have priority over other needs.y &apos;    &apos;   The main effect of shortage of residential places, combined with shortage in many areas of training centres and of social workers, is that some   families withmentally handicapped members living at home have to continue under; almost unbearablestress and many hospitals are under unrelenting pressure to admit more patients toalready overcrowded wards.Shortage of trained staff^ Shortage of staff, particularly trained staff, is a limiting factor on thequality and further development of every part of the looal authority services.   Thisshortage affecte social workers who are needed to support families and the mentally handicapped themselvesj . .    . and staff for training centres and residential homes.Social Workers76,     &apos;  The number of trained social workers is increasing, but there are s till notnearly enough to give every family with a mentally handicapped member the support itshould have.     The amalgamation of social services into one department of each local authority should help to provide abetter standard of care for families of the mentally handicapped by bringing together teams consisting of social workers with a variety of special skills and knowledge.    For example, social workers trained in child care will be available inthese departments to add their contribution to the care of mentally handicapped children.    In 1969 about 2,000 mental health social workers were employed by localauthorities, of whom just over 600 had had training in social work.    More qualifyingand) in-service training     is planned, including training directed specially towardthe social problems resulting from mental handicap.
Staff of adult training centresThe total number of staff in adult training centres is adequate for thepresent number of trainees, but nearly three-quaitera   of the staff are stillunqualified.    Until courses were started under the auspices of the TrainingCouncil for Teachers of the Mentally Handicapped, which was set up in 1964, therewas no specific training for this work apart from one pioneer course run by theNational Association for Mental Health.    There are now courses, mainly in colleges of Further Education, from which about 170   people a year qualify for the TrainingCouncil&apos;s Diploma; about two-thirds of these.in recent years have been training centrestaff seconded by local authorities.1^ The proportion of qualified staff is therefore increasing, but while so manyof those employed are still unqualified there is a danger of imbalance in the work ofthe training centres - for example too much emphasis on production and contract work at the expense of a progressive programme of social and work training, recreationand further education.Staff of residential homes1^        Even for the small number of residential homes which exist now, it isdifficult to find staff, especially trained staff.    Existing staff are people with various forms of previous experience.    Some have been trained for their previouswork, but not for this work.    Without appropriate training, they may be inclined toover-protection of the residents, thus limiting their progress towards greater selfreliance and independence.     Special training has only recently started, and will fall to be developed by the new Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work.Summary of local authority services% It is right to acknowledge the progress made by the local authorities in thelast ten years in developing good quality services for the mentally handicapped in the
community.     But in national terms these are still grossly deficient in quantity.In particular there is a serious shortage of adult training centres, grossshortage of residential accommodation, and great need for more trained staff of allkinds.    The developments recommended by the Royal Commission 14 years ago are farfrom being accomplished.     The Government&apos;s plans for faster progress are described in Chapter 6.HOSPITAL SERVICES now the difficulties which hospitals for the mentally handicapped are now facingstem partly from the inheritance of history - isolation, old and unsuitablebuildings, large numbers of patients who need a protective environment but nothospital care. They are also due to changes during the last two decadesin the make-up of their patient-population, and changes in public and professionalattitudes towards the mentally handicapped.    Most of the hospitals have not had given the resources with which some of their difficulties could be overcome, andsome of the difficulties are insuperable without changes in the location of hospitals and substantial development of local authority services.Changes in patient populationThe total number of patients in hospitals used wholly for the mentally handi-capped, or in units set aside for the mentally handicapped in other hospitals, has changed little in the last fifteen years.     It has varied between54,000 and 60,000.    Within this total there have been two substantial andsignificant changes.     There is now a much higher proportion of severely handicappedpatients, and a very different age distribution.More severely handicappedPrecise figures of the proportion of severely and mildly handicapped patientsare not available for past years, to compare with the figures now being obtained fromthe surveys and censuses mentioned in Chapter 2.     But it is common knowledge that/proportionpatients admitted in recent years include a higher/ suffering from severe mental and physical handicap, and that they are surviving longer than in the past.    At the sametime, the number of mildly handicapped who used to assist in the running of the hospitals has dropped.    This is probably due partly to the development of community
services, particularly training centres, which has made it easier for those withmild handicap to remain with their families, and partly to the success of the hospitals in rehabilitating and discharging more of the less handicapped patients.More older patientsH The change in age distribution is clear from Table 2.Table 2Patients resident in National Health Service hospitals, orhospital units, for the mentally handicapped-	Age 0-14	15-54	55 and over	Total1954	7,000(a)	45,700(a)	5,500(a)	58,100(a)1963	6,900	40,300	11,200	58,4001968	6,600	39,300	13,500	59,4001969	6,400	38,600	13,850	58,850(a)    The 1954 figures include some 4,000 patients living in the community &apos; onlicence&apos; after discharge who cannot be allocated to age-groups;   most are likely tohave been in the 15-54 age-group.% The fall in the number of children since 1963 may reflect the development oflocal authority services for children outside hospital.    There has been a small butsteady fall in the 15-54 age-group, and a striking increase in the number of olderpatients.Effect of these changes% The increased proportion of severely handicapped patients combined with theincreased proportion of elderly patients has produced a patient population which makes greater demands on the nursing staff and contains fewer who are able to help in domestic and other jobs within the hospital.Change in attitudes^] The old custodial attitudes have gradually been replaced by the.more positiveattitudes underlying the principles summarised in Chapter 3.    This is partly theresult of work done in the hospitals and elsewhere which has demonstrated that even
the severely handicapped have previously unrecognised capabilities for developmentof manual and other skills and varying degrees of social independence if they receive the necessary stimulus and appropriate education and other forms of training,,Other contributing factors have been greater public awareness of, and.sympathy towards, the mentally handicapped and their families;   more open discussionof the subject) and general expectation that the mentally handicapped should receiveservices of as high a quality as the state provides for any other group of disabledchildren or adults.    The National Society for Mentally Handicapped Children ,      theNational Association for Mental Health and other voluntary bodies, and their localassociations, have played a large part in bringing about this change in public attitudes.New demands in the hospitals this has meant demands for more space, more equipment and morestaff for teaching, play and recreation, occupational and industrial therapy.Higher standards of clothing, furnishing and deccr are expected, in line with the changing standards and fashions of the times.    Physiotherapy, speech therapy andother special services are recognised as necessary for the proper treatment ofdisabled patients.    More individual attention to the social, medical and nursingneeds of individual patients is known to be needed.    Contact with the world outsidethe hospital, and with patients&apos; families, is known to be beneficial.Almost all hospitals have introduced some improvements to meet some of these new demands.    But very few have had the resources to do anything like as much asthe staff themselves want to do.    On the contrary, the increasing pressures of having to deal with more heavily handicapped patients in unsuitable buildings with toofew staff have only too often led to falling rather than rising standards, as described in more detail in the rest of this Chapter.Isolation and sizeI..      When many of the present hospitals were built, or when country houses wereacquired to be adapted and extended for use as &quot;institutions&apos; for the mentally handicapped,isolation from the surrounding community  and substantial size were consideredadvantages.    Now isolation and size present serious problems.cq.nfidi!t3t3al
Difficult to get to$1 A large   hospital necessarily serves a large population.     Contact betweenhospital staff and patients1 families, general practitioners and local health authorities is very difficult;   so is visiting by relatives.     Consultants from thehospital cannot easily hold out-patient clinics throughout the area served.     Daypatients cannot get to the hospital.   It is difficult to recruit enough domestic and other staff locally.Isolation of staff^2,      /   If the hospital is isolated, whatever its size, the same difficulties ariseor are exacerbated.   Isolation also affects professional work, cutting off staff and patients from the rest of medicine, nursing and social work, and tending toinhibit the dissemination and application of ideas and methods, including methodsof management, which have proved beneficial in other hospitals.Size^ At the end of 1969 7 of our hospitals for the mentally handicapped containedover 1,500 beds;   2 of these had over 2,000.    Another 3 clusters of hospitalsadministered as single hospitals had over 1,500.     33 hospitals or clusters of hospitals had between 500 and 1,500. Since the early 1960s the policy has been not ttplan any new hospital for the mentally handicapped for more than 500 patients, but some newlarger hospitals whose planning started earlier have recently come into use.    Someof these are remote as well, and have wards empty because staff cannot be recruited.% There are also many smaller hospitals.    In 1969 there were over 50 withbetween 100 and 500 beds and nearly 50 with less than 100 beds.     But many of theseassociated with larger hospitals and with them take patients from all parts of asingle catchment area.    Small hospitals therefore at present are sometimes just asremote from the population they serve as the larger ones.Unsuitable buildings%\       About  30 million has been spent since 1948 by Regional Hospital Boards on new hospitals for the mentally handicapped and on large schemes of adaptation,
improvement or extension.    Nevertheless many of the hospital buildings still in useare very old and originally built for other purposes;   half of today&apos;s patients arein hospitals over sixty years old.    Even hospitals built in the 1920s and 1930sdo not have sanitation or heating acceptable on present standards unless they havehad substantial adaptations..&quot;\2   TJven more important is that most of the present hospital buildings were designed for custodial care, and for less severely handicapped patients.    It is extremely hard, though creditable attempts have been made, to create a homelyatmosphere in a barrack-like institutional building^     or to care for severelyhandicapped incontinent patients in multi-storey buildings without lifts, or withlavatories on one floor and the rooms used during the day on another.Few hospitals built overtax years ago originally included the space now considered necessary for education,   industrial and occupational therapy andleisure activities.    Additions have been made,   to many hospitals, and dormitoriesconverted, for this purpose.    But all too often this is still not enough.Activities such as industrial therapy often take place in many different parts of alarge hospital site,which can make the organisation of a progressive therapeuticprogramme difficult if not impossible.OvercrowdingAlmost all the hospitals are overcrowded, or have some overcrowded wards.A survey in 19&amp;9 showed that less than 10% of all patients had the 70 sq. ft. perpatient in bedrooms and dormitories and 48 sq. ft. per patient in dining and livingrooms which are recommended as the desirable minimum.   Nearly 60?  had less than50 sq. ft. sleeping space and over 40$ had less than 30 sq.ft. in day rooms.Little activity or privacy.   In many hospitals the most overcrowded wards are those containing severelyhandicapped patients, many of them incontinent, who remain in the wards all day for lack of facilities for occupation elsewhere in the hospital.   In such wardsthere is not enough room - even if there were enough staff - to give the patientsany stimulating occupation.   At night they sleep in dormitories with scarcely enough
room to move between serried ranks of beds.   There is no room to keep stocks of personal clothes, and no space for cupboards or lockers for patients&apos; otherpossessions.   As a result they are not given clothes of their own or otherpossessions, even if this is done in other parts of the hospital.Little treatmento( In such conditions hospital treatment&apos; is restricted to meeting the patients&apos; most basic physical needs.   The nurses&apos; time is taken up in gettingpatients up in the morning, dressing, washing and feeding them, dealing withincontinence during the day and putting them to bed in the evening.

advice on employment;   this should be arranged for every young person well before he or she leaves a special school.Mentally handicapped adults should be examined and assessed regularly,whether they are living at home, in another residential home, or in hospital.The assessment should be directed particularly to their medical condition,social capacity, the extent to which their needs are being met and theirpotentialities developed, and whether progression to other forms of care is needed.     Regular assessment should form part of the programme of adult training centres and sheltered workshops.Organisation for assessment\iv       Arrangements for setting, in; the initial assessment of newly detectedhandicap, and subsequent reassessment,should be agreed locally by all concerned.The different needs of children at various stages of development, and ofadolescents and adults^must be taken into account in drawing up a plan ofaction. This should be known to all who may be the first to suspect mental handicapbe involved in the care of mentally handicapped children or adults.These include general practitionersj psychiatrists,Paediatricians and others working in hospitals) doctors, health visitors and others in the community health services social workers and others in the personal social services; and staff of the education services and special employmentservices. _^_._______        .  .____------------------------------   -------V\ Effective co-ordination is essential. Methods of achieving it need further study.    The Department of Health and Social Security hopes to issue guidance on this in relation to the comprehensive assessment of persons with any form of handicap ordisability.Special comprehensive assessment centres for handicapped children(of any age or handicap). are essential, on the lines recommended in the memorandumon hospital services for children-issued by the Departments with HM(7l)   22 .This does not necessarily require
his family.    It is difficult to turn away a person with any degree of handicap whois not capable of fending for himself and becomes homeless through the death ofrelatives or through their moving to a house without room for him, if there are no alternative facilities for residential care outside hospital.    These are thecircumstances in which many hospitals have continued to tolerate gross overcrowding.Joint remedies&quot;   Overcrowding has been a severe problem for these hospitals for many years.All Regional Hospital Boards have made improvements and extensions in an attempt to overcome it, or at least keep pace with the pressure to admit more patients.     Inthe last 18 months a more vigorous attack on the problem has been launched, as described in Chapter 6.    But the solution does not lie only in the hands of thehospital authorities.    It also lies with the local authorities, through theimprovement of domiciliary and other services,to make it reasonably possible forfamilies to keep mentally handicapped children and adults in their homes, and through the provision of residential care for those who need it but do not need tobe in hospital.Living standardsAs well as being overcrowded, buildings are often dilapidated and poorlyfurnished.    In many hospitals there has not been enough money,   or not enoughimagination, to buy modern furniture, to repaint wards in bright colours, toprovide each patient with clothes of his own in modern styles, or even to provide/ variedgood and    food.    In many there is not enough space to give every patient acupboard of his own for his own clothes and personal possessions.In other hospitals these things have been done, and patients have appreciatedthem. Some hospitals provide good quality clothes for each individualpatient.    Some provide excellent food.    In some, all patients have a cupboard orlooker for their personal possessions.    Some have good modern furniture, gaycurtains and carpets and bedspreads.    Toys and playthings are excellent in somehospitals.    But few if any have had enough money to afford all these things for all38
/23o ix*cl g..._____ c-----------        --       ...... -- ------r-----   have been given targets of improvements to achieve minimum standards of amenity, and money with which to startdoing so0StaffingCauses of under-staffinglOl Isolation and insufficient money have together contributed to serious under-staffing in many hospitals.     Shortage of finance has limited the total numbers employed;   the size and location of many hospitals has made it difficult to findsufficient staff locally;   and poor working conditions have made it hard to attract new recruits.Nurses, domestic staff and doctors$     *    The number of nurses (including student and pupil nurses and nursingassistants) in hospitals used solely for the mentally handicapped rose, in whole-timeequivalents from10,000 in 1959 to 14,600 in 1969;   including units for the mentally handicappedin other hospitals, the number in 1969 was 15,200.    Domestic staff rose from 1,900whole-time equivalentsin 1965 to 2,700 in 1969.    But these numbers are still insufficient to allownurses to care properly for heavily handicapped patients, to give all patientsthe personal interest and social stimulation they require, and to relieve the nurses of domestic work.The number of medical, nursing and domestic staff in 1969 are given inTable 5, which also shows the range of variation between different hospitals.Some of the variations are accounted for by differences in the proportion ofchildren and of severely handicapped patients, by whether other specialist staff or/providelurses &apos; their education, training and work done by patients or domestic staff/providenurses &apos;     their education, training and occupation and by the amount of domestic- 39

A study in1965-6 showed that there was then on average one member of the nursing staff on duty in/ onethe ward during the day to nearly 16 adults and to 11 children.     The ratio varied indifferent hospitals betweel Is 10 and 1:34 adults and between 1:6 and 1:16 children.    Inmost large hospitals there is often only one enrolled nurse on duty in each ward at night,some wards share one nurse between them.Other staff shortageslllL     In general, the standard of staffing is such that in many hospitals it is notpossible to give the individual attention which the staff know is needed and wish toI_______ dve.    Many of the skills needed for assessment, education, training and treatment arenot provided.Effect of shortagesl!2.     Doctors responsible for several hundred in-patients cannot easily hold many out-patient clinics.   Nor can they regularly reassess the progress of each in-patient andplan individual treatment and training.   Nor can such a plan be implemented where medical and other staff are not available to carry it out.113.    Opportunities for modifying disturbed behaviour and incontinence by individualattention cannot be taken.^Lt-   In the worst places this produces boredom and tension and even occasionalviolence.   Patients become apathetic and institutionalised, and sink into a state of complete physical and CONFIDENTIAL
social dependence, Nurses are frustrated by having no time to provide more thanattention to basic physical needs,without using the psyohiatric nursing skills inwhich they have been trained.     They often have to clean the wards themselves for lack of domestic staff.ManagementllS&quot; In 1970 the new National Health Servioe Hospital Advisory Service sent teamsof professional officers to visit all hospitals for the mentally handicapped in morethan half of the English hospital regions and in the whole of Wales.     In his firstAnnual Report the Director has this to say about the management of hospital services for the mentally handicapped.&quot;Many hospital staff have criticised their Regional Boards and theDepartment of Health for failing to provide a modern policy, plan modemprovision, or indeed give the leadership needed in recent years.......The visiting teams have found that Management Committees also vary considerably in their attitudes.     Many are very conscientious and visitregularly, but often restrict their interest to the social activities orimmediate physical conditions.    In general, however, many seem fearful ofinnovation and tend to accept the matters put before them by the senior officials of the hospitals.     It is rare to hear of a Management Committeeasking about the organisation of the therapeutic services in the hospital, orfor information which would confirm that the senior staff are workingeffectively together, or planning for the development of the therapeuticservices.    I hear that Management Committees are rightly concerned that theyshould not interfere with individual clinical judgment or with professionaldecisions in generals     On the other hand, they 3eem unduly fearful of showingany interest or concern over the way the therapeutic services are developingor the general pattern of care or therapeutic atmosphere within the hospitalas a whole9One conclusion to be drawn from the teams&apos; visits is that one of the mostserious defects in the hospital services for the mentally handicapped lies inthe failure of the senior medical, nursing and administrative staff to meet together to discuss the services provided by the hospital and to plantogether for the future.    Many hospitals fail to plan the therapeuticresources at their disposal so as to use them to best effect for the populationconcerned.    It has frequently proved necessary to advise that 3ome kind ofmultl-disciplinary planning committee should be formed to ensure that all thetherapeutic groups meet and agree on a co-ordinated plan for the hospital.Some hospitals have-been successful with planning committees including allheads of departments and representatives of ward staff. ......It is difficult to convey to those who have no experience of the problems,the stress imposed on ward staff.    For example, two nurses may beresponsible for rousing, dressing and toiletting 50 or so severelyhandicapped patients, most of whom cannot dress themselves without some help,and many are incontinent or become so with minimum waiting.    In this
situation there may be only two toilets available in the dormitory area.The same ward may have no room for occupational or social therapy, thehospital departments concerned may be too small and none of the patients mayleave the ward from one week to the next.    These conditions are the fault of management at all levels, not of ward staff, and the latter are understandablyresentful of criticism they have sometimes received.&quot;But he also says:-&quot;We have found ample evidence of good practices and new ideas in every aspect of the hospital service for the mentally handicapped.    At Regional Boardlevel significant contributions to the development of the hospital services for the mentally handicapped have been apparent.......The beneficial effects of Management Committees have also been apparent.In particular, in Wales the team were impressed by the attitude of theManagement Committee and staff of a chest hospital which had agreed to accepta group of mentally handicapped patients although the hospital had had no experience of such patients in the past.    There seemed little doubt that theinterest and enthusiasm of the Management Committee had played a significantpart in making a success of this ne?/ venture.    At another hospital which had had serious difficulties, the beneficial influence of a recently appointed chairman and interested Management Committee was apparent at all levels of thehospital&apos;s activities.The teams have noted the widespread benefits which follow when a consultantinvolves the other therapeutic professions in day-to-day work, assessment and continuing treatment.     They have noted the benefits which follow once heprovides an increasing service within the community, particularly in out-patient clinics or in meeting parents  groups.    In view of the fact that theamount of time a consultant can give to each individual patient is limited,the most effective services have often been those where the consultant takesparticular care to see that he enables other therapeutic professional staff toplay their full rolec fflo...oTeams have seen nurses who take an active part in social training, help toplace their patients in suitable situations in the community, and run an effective follow-up service for their patients.     On wards, morale isooftensignificantly higher where the ward nurse has a major say in the pattern of care in the ward, ward design and decoration, and the right to take relevantdecisions for the individual patient.    In the better hospitals it is usual tofind that the ward staff have a good relationship with visiting relatives andare able to give them information on progress. ....../        In the quality of management, as&apos;in most other aspects, standards varywidely from one hospital to another.
General comment on hospital servicesFundamentally, what has happened is that outdated views have continuedto influence the allocation of financial and other resources to many hospitalsfor the mentally handicapped.      In some places attitudes have not kept pace with new knowledge   about the latent capacities of the mentally handicapped,public expectations of better services and the general rise in the standard ofliving.     Too little account has been taken of the increasing burden placed onthe hospital staff by changes in the make-up of the patient population.But these generalisations are unfair if they give the impression thatstandards are low everywhere.      Despite the difficulties outlined in this chapter some hospitals provide a very high standard of care indeed for mentally handicapped patients.       Almost all hospitals have some good features.Average standards compare well with those in many other developed countries.Within the hospitals forward-looking ideas abound.      The fact that so muchhas been achieved with such inadequate resources is a tribute to the staff, andin particular to the nurses, on whom the deficiencies weigh most heavily, andon whom criticism has often been unfairly focussed.43
Success In rehabilitation of patientsFinally, it should be made clear that these hospitals do not have a whollystatic population.    In spite of the lack of residential homes outside, and theproblems inside,the hospitals have succeeded in rehabilitating and discharging patients in all age-groups, including children and the elderly.Relevant figures are given in Table 4.     They relate to the total numbers in hospital in Table 2 (paragraph     . ), but exclude patients admitted for short-termcare of less than 3 months who, though they now account for well over half theadmissions each year, occupy only about yfi of the beds at any one time.Between 1954 and 19&amp;4 there was a substantial increase both in admissions anddischarges.    Both have fallen slightly since 1964*    Even with the present very limited facilities for care outside hospital, particularly residential accommodation,one patient in every twenty is discharged each year;   of these about half areof admission.discharged within two years /About a third of all discharges take place after morethan five years in hospital. More patients leave the hospitals each year throughdischarge than through death.44

CHAPTER 5.     THE SERVICES REQUIREDGENERAL PRINCIPLES(Z-&quot;?      The main principles on which, according to current thinking, services for the mentally handicapped and their families should be based were summarised in Chapter 3*     The description of present services in Chapter kshows how far we are from applying them fully.     The present Chapter describesin more detail the component parts of the services we should now aim toprovide.     Chapter 6 describes the action in haafll or needed to achieve this,and Chapter 7 the important contribution which voluntary service can make.Collaboration between authorities and between professions\2r*^    The mentally handicapped and their families need help from professionsworking in services administered by a variety of authorities and departments.It is &apos; important that the resources of the health services,personal social services and education services should be deployed in close and effective collaboration.     Only if this is done can the relevantprofessional skills be most effectively used to provide complete andco-ordinated services.Main services requiredIZS&quot;    Tbe main services required are:-(i)   Prevention or early detection of mental handicap so far as practicable,(ii)   Comprehensive assessment of the mentally handicapped person&apos;s assets and disabilities, and periodic reassessment,(iii)   Co-ordinated advice, support and practical help for their families,(iv) Education, social and work training, day care and occupation orthe opportunity for work according to the handicapped person&apos;sindividual capacities.
(v)   Residential accommodation according to individual needs.(vi)   Hospital medical, nursing and other services for those who require them, as out-patients, day patients or in-patients.METHODS OF PREVENTION AND EARLY DETECTIONLimited but increasing knowledgejtJ, At present the possibilities of preventing mental handicap are very limited.     The principal methods at present available are described in the Appendix.Most of these are quite recent and not yet widely applied, and most are atthe research stage.11&quot;] Genetic   counselling with family planning advice and treatment havepreventive possibilities.     Research is still being carried out into theearly antenatal detection of Down*s Syndrome (mongolism).     Expert careduring labour has been shown to reduce the incidence of handicaps associatedwith the hazards of birth.     Evidence is becoming available to show thatintensive care for babies can lower the incidence of handicaps after birth.Regular developmental screening of young children, particularly those at special risk, is essential to detect as early as possible deviant mentaldevelopment.There is evidence that mild degrees of mental handicap among culturallydeprived children can be improved by pre-school education and by help &quot;fortheir families.Organisation for prevention and detectionl^0 .       It is important that these preventive measures (and others which may become available as research increases our knowledge of the causes of mentalhandicap) should be known and used.     Doctors and nurses in general practice47
and domiciliary health services and in hospitals should all be concerned withthis, as should social workers and others who are in touch with parents orprospective parents.     A co-ordinated organisation is needed to achieve this;it should include a reliable recording system to help in keeping under reviewall&quot; children at risk of developing mental or physical handicaps.COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENTMulti-disciplinary approachAs soon as any defect is detected or suspected, a comprehensiveassessment of the nature of the handicap or handicaps, and of the needs and problems of the handicapped person and his family, is required.     Medical,educational, psychological and social aspects should be considered together,as appropriate to the age of the child.     No one person can be expected to possess the range of skills required;   a multi-disciplinary approach is needed.j3i      Multi-disciplinary assessment should be repeated at intervals, as thehandicapped child or adult grows and develops.     The members of the assessmentteam will vary according to the handicapped person&apos;s age and current problems.Assessment and reassessment/3j        When mental handicap is detected or suspected in a young child, important-members of the assessment team will be a paediatrician concerned in the assessment and care of handicapped children^    - a consultant in psychiatryj andether experts in medicine, education, psychology, nursing and social work.The family doctor should always be involved as well as others concerned with support for the family,such as the health visitor and social worker.     Reassessment of progressshould be made frequently during childhood.13^      As the child grows older, educational and social assessment become increasingly important. Handicapped adolescents and adultsneed special assessment of their vocational and social capacities and skilled48
new buildings, though in some places an addition to an existing buildingmay help.     A multi-disciplinary team can also meet in a health centre, anout-patient clinic, an adult training centre, a special ssdiool   , aresidential home or a hospital, whichever is most convenient and appropriate for discussing the assessment and progress of individual children or adults.ADVICE AND PRACTICAL HELP FOR THE FAMILYCounsellingWhen handicap is first detected, the parents must be told this sympatheticallyand skillfully.     They need help in understanding the nature of their child&apos;s handicap, an experienced view of what to expectfrom the child and of the likely family problems as he grows older, and advice on how the family itself can best help the handicapped child todevelop his abilities to the full.     They also need a realistic appraisal of^including voluntary services,the services available/and information on how to obtain them.     If there isa co-ordinated multi-disciplinary approach to assessment there should be norisk of parents receiving conflicting advice.^       Parents also need help with problems of adjustment arising from theirown feelings towards a handicapped child, such as disappointment, sense of failure, anxiety about the future and concern for any other children in the for examplefamily. These personal difficulties can lead/to rejection of the handicapped childon the one hand,or over-protection on the other, either of which may have a lasting effecton the child&apos;s future. The advice given to parents shouldtake into account the total family situation including the needs of other children so as to avoid subjecting them to deprivation or undue strain as aresult of the preoccupation of their parents with the handicapped child.I        Many people including general practitioners, health visitors, social/ psychiatrists and paediatricians,workers1,have a contribution to make in advising parents, but their work must be co-ordinated.     As the child grows older his teachers and others concerned with his treatment or training should also contribute.     The personbest placed to act as co-coordinator is likely to be the social worker, who49
should take her part in the multi-disciplinary team as soon as handicapis suspected and thereafter maintain a continuing relationship with thehandicapped child and his family.]4i   ^    Many parents obtain relief and reassurance from contact with otherparents of mentally handicapped children.     The establishment of localparents&apos; groups in some areas has proved a valuable support.Practical assistancel^g     1   The family will also need practical assistance of many kinds.     this may include home-help, domiciliary nursing, laundry service for theincontinent, sitters-in, play centre, day nursery, nursery school, youthclub, and temporary residential care for the handicapped person duringemergencies or holidays.     Voluntary as well as statutory service will help,and may need to be invoked and co-ordinated by the social worker.     Servicesneeded for education, training, care and treatment during the day are described later in this Chapter.14^-,      Some families may also qualify for the new tax-free attendance allowance 4.8Gof/   pel week which will be available from December 1971 under Section kof the National Insurance (Old persons&apos; and widows&apos; pensions and attendance allowance) Act 1970, where a severely disabled person at home requires care orattention day and night, or continual supervision for his own safety or that of others,The family as a whole)^-ht The family should be told about these services and advised on their use.     This requires skilled evaluation of the real needs of the family,particularly of the mother.     Reassurance and personal guidance from the health visitor and social worker on how to care for her child herself may at times be more valuable to the mother than bringing in help from outside.At other times, however, in the interests of her own health and that of50
GCy^lFIDEN I IASLthe rest of the family, a period of total relief from the daily routineof caring for the handicapped child or adult may be necessary.     Caringfor a mentally handicapped person at home makes     great calls on thefamily1s emotional reserve.     The essence of good community care isa.the availability of someone, usually the social worker, from whom theycan confidently expect understanding and help to meet any situation.Leaving the family homeIf and when the time comes for the handicapped person to leave the family home and enter residential care or hospital for more than atemporary stay, this should be planned well in advance so as to cause theleast possible distress to the family and upset to the handicapped person.The full co-operation of the family will be needed to help him to settle in his new environment.     Ideally, this will be close to his family home.But if it is not, additional practical help may be called for in the formof transport, or sitting-in services for other children to allow the parentsto visit.     Extra help may be needed in the home when the handicappedperson comes home for weekends or for a longer holiday.     The tax-freemattendance allowance mentioned in para. 5 &quot;23 will be payable if thecircumstances justify it, either for the full week(s) of the holidayor on a daily basis.if the severely handicapped persion is at home for less than aveek at a time.5)
the severely handicapped have previously unrecognised capabilities for developmentof manual and other skills and varying degrees of social independence if they receive the necessary stimulus and appropriate education and other forms of training,,sympathy towards, the mentally handicapped and their families;   more open discussionof the subjectj and general expectation that the mentally handicapped should receiveservices of as high a quality as the state provides for any other group of disabledchildren or adults.     The National Sooiety for Mentally Handicapped Children ,      theNational Association for Mental Health and other voluntary bodies, and their localassociations, have played a large part in bringing about this change in public attitudes.New demands in the hospitals this has meant demands for more space, more equipment and morestaff for teaching, play and recreation, occupational and industrial therapy.Higher standards of clothing^ furnishing and decor are expected, in line with the changing standards and fashions of the times.    Physiotherapy, speech therapy andother special services are recognised as necessary for the proper treatment ofdisabled patients.    More individual attention to the social, medical and nursingneeds of individual patients is known to be needed.     Contact with the world outsidethe hospital, and with patients&apos; families, is known to be beneficial.Almost all hospitals have introduced some improvements to meet some of these new demands.     But very few have had the resources to do anything like as much asthe staff themselves want to do.     On the contrary, the increasing pressures of having to deal with more heavily handicapped patients in unsuitable buildings with toofew staff have only too often led to falling rather than rising standards, as described in more detail in the rest of this Chapter.Isolation and sizei;.      When many of the present hospitals were built, or when country houses wereacquired to be adapted and extended for use as&apos;institutions&apos; for the mentally handicapped,isolation from the surrounding community  and substantial size were consideredadvantages.    Now isolation and size present sar^ous problems.ftOther contributing factors have been greater public awareness of, and.
Difficult to get toA large   hospital necessarily serves a large population.     Contact betweenhospital staff and patients1 families, general practitioners and local health authorities is very difficult;   so is visiting by relatives.    Consultants from thehospital cannot easily hold out-patient clinics throughout the area served.    Daypatients cannot get to the hospital.   It is difficult to recruit enough domestic and other staff locally.Isolation of staff,      /   If the hospital is isolated, whatever its size, the same difficulties ariseor are exacerbated.   Isolation also affects professional work, cutting off staff and patients from the rest of medicine, nursing and social work, and tending toinhibit the dissemination and application of ideas and methods, including methodsof management, which have proved beneficial in other hospitals.SizeAt the end of 1969 7 of our hospitals for the mentally handicapped containedover 1,500 beds;   2 of these had over 2,000.    Another 3 clusters of hospitalsadministered as single hospitals had over 1,500.     33 hospitals or clusters of hospitals had between 500 and 1,500. Since the early 1960s the policy has been not to plan any new hospital for the mentally handicapped for more than 500 patients, but some newlarger hospitals whose planning started earlier have recently come into use.    Someof these are remote as well, and have wards empty because staff cannot be recruited.There are also many smaller hospitals.     In 1969 there were over 50 withbetween 100 and 500 beds and nearly 50 with less than 100 beds.    But many of these are associated with larger hospitals and with them take patients from all parts of asingle catchment area.    Small hospitals therefore at present are sometimes just asremote from the population they serve as the larger ones.Unsuitable buildingsAbout  30 million has been spent 3ince 1948 by Regional Hospital Boards on new hospitals for the mentally handicapped and on large schemes of adaptation,
improvement or extension.    Nevertheless many of the hospital buildings still in useare very old and originally built for other purposes;   half of today1s patients arein hospitals over sixty years old.    Even hospitals built in the 1920s and 1930sdo not have sanitation or heating acceptable on present standards unless they havehad substantial adaptations.j TSven more important is that most of the present hospital buildings were designed for custodial care, and for less severely handicapped patients.    It is extremely hard, though creditable attempts have been made, to create a homelyatmosphere in a barrack-like institutional building^     or to care for severelyhandicapped incontinent patients in multi-storey buildings without lifts, or withlavatories on one floor and the rooms used during the day on another.g Few hospitals built over ten years ago originally included the space now considered neoessary for education,   industrial and occupational therapy andleisure activities.    Additions have been made,   to many hospitals, and dormitoriesconverted, for this purpose.    But all too often this is still not enough.Activities such as industrial therapy often take place in many different parts of alarge hospital site,which can make the organisation of a progressive therapeuticprogramme difficult if not impossible.Overcrowding4 Almost all the hospitals are overcrowded, or have some overcrowded wards.A survey in 1969 showed that less than 10% of all patients had the 70 sq. ft. per_patient in bedrooms and dormitories and 48 sq. ft. per patient in dining and livingrooms which are recommended as the desirable minimum.   Nearly 60^ had less than50.sq. ft. sleeping space and over 4C$ had less than 30 sq.ft. in day rooms.Little activity or privacyIn many hospitals the most overcrowded wards are those containing severelyhandicapped patients, many of them incontinent, who remain in the wards all day for lack of facilities for occupation elsewhere in the hospital.   In such wardsthere is not enough room - even if there were enough staff - to give the patientsany stimulating occupation.   At night they sleep in dormitories with scarcely enoughconfidential
room to move between serried ranks of beds.   There is no room to keep stocks of personal clothes, and no space for cupboards or lockers for patients&apos; otherpossessions.   As a result they are not given clothes of their own or otherpossessions, even if this is done in other parts of the hospital.Little treatment in such conditions hospital &quot;treatment&apos; is restricted to meeting the patients&apos; most basic physical needs.   The nurses&apos; time is taken up in gettingpatients up in the morning, dressing, washing and feeding them, dealing withincontinence during the day and putting them to bed in the evening.   It is a life of minimal satisfaction for patients and staff alike.Efforts to introduce activityThese are the extreme results of overcrowding combined with understaffing.There are all gradations between this and real success in introducing activity anda sense of purpose into even seriously overcrowded wards.Reasons for overcrowding3 It is difficult for a hospital, however full it may be, to refuse to admita severely handicapped person whose presence at home is putting unbearable strain &apos;3ii
before he or she leaves a special school.f^v      .   Mentally handicapped adults should be examined and assessed regularly,whether they are living at home, in another residential home, or in hospital.The assessment should be directed particularly to their medical condition,social capacity, the extent to which their needs are being met and theirpotentialities developed, and whether progression to other forms of care is needed.     Regular assessment should form part of the programme of adult training centres and sheltered workshops.Organisation for assessment\oi / &quot;trainI7W       Arrangements for setting, in&apos;the initial assessment of newly detectedhandicap, and subsequent reassessment^should be agreed locally by all concerned.The different needs of children at various stages of development, and ofadolescents and adults^must be taken into account in drawing up a plan ofaction, This should be known to all who may be the first to suspect mental handicap orbe involved in the care of mentally handicapped children or adults.These include general practitioners; psychiatrists,Paediatricians and others working in hospitals; doctors, health visitors and others in the community health services; social workers and others in the personal social services; and staff of the education services and special employmentservices. _________-___&apos;______-----------------------------   ----------(V? Effective co-ordination is essential. Methods of achieving it need further study.     The Department of Health and Social Security hopes to issue guidance on this in relation to the comprehensive assessment of persons with any form of handicap ordisability.Special comprehensive assessment centres for handicapped children(of any age or handicap)   are essential, on the lines recommended in the memorandumon hospital services for children issued by the Departments with HM(7l)   22 .This does not necessarily require,   37Confidential
his family.    It ia difficult to turn away a person with any degree of handicap whois not capable of fending for himself and becomes homeless through the death ofrelatives or through their moving to a house without room for him, if there are no alternative facilities for residential care outside hospital.    These are thecircumstances in which many hospitals have continued to tolerate gross overcrowding.Joint remediesu     &apos;   Overcrowding has been a severe problem for these hospitals for many years.All Regional Hospital Boards have made improvements and extensions in an attempt to overcome it, or at least keep pace with the pressure to admit more patients.    Inthe last 18 months a more vigorous attack on the problem has been launched, as described in Chapter 6.    But the solution does not lie only in the hands of thehospital authorities.    It also lies with the local authorities, through theimprovement of domiciliary and other services,to make it reasonably possible forfamilies to keep mentally handicapped children and adults in their homes, and through the provision of residential care for those who need it but do not need tobe in hospital.Living standardsAs well as being overcrowded, buildings are often dilapidated and poorlyfurnished.    In many hospitals there has not been enough money,   or not enoughimagination, to buy modern furniture, to repaint wards in bright colours, toprovide each patient with clothes of his own in modern styles, or even to provide/ variedgood and &apos;  food.    In many there is not enough space to give every patient acupboard of his own for his own clothes and personal possessions.(ott In other hospitals these things have been done, and patients have appreciatedthem. Some hospitals provide good quality clothes for each individualpatient.    Some provide excellent food.    In some, all patients have a cupboard orlocker for their personal possessions.    Some have good modern furniture, gaycurtains and carpets and bedspreads.    Toys and playthings are excellent in somehospitals.    But few if any have had enough money to afford all these things for all

Shortage of finance has limited the total numbers employed;   the size and location of many hospitals has made it difficult to findsufficient staff locally;   and poor working conditions have made it hard to attract new recruits.Nurses, domestic staff and doctors\$     *    The number of nurses (including student and pupil nurses and nursingassistants) in hospitals used solely for the mentally handicapped rosej in whole-timeequivalents from10,000 in 1959 to 14,600 in 1969;   including units for the mentally handicappedin other hospitals, the number in 1969 was 15,200.    Domestic staff rose from 1,900whole-time equivalentsin 1965 to 2,700 in 1969.    But these numbers are still insufficient to allownurses to care properly for heavily handicapped patients, to give all patientsthe personal interest and social stimulation they require, and to relieve the nurses of domestic work.The number of medical, nursing and domestic staff in I969 are given inTable 5, which also shows the range of variation between different hospitals.Some of the variations are accounted for by differences in the proportion ofchildren and of severely handicapped patients, by whether other specialist staff or/provideturses &apos; their education, training and work done by patients or domestic staffnurses ^r0their education, training and occupation and by the amount of domestic-33

social dependence. Nurses are frustrated by having no time to provide more thanattention to basic physical needs, without using the psychiatric nursing skills inwhich they have been trained.     They often have to clean the wards themselves for lack of domestic staff.Management]IS     ;   In 1970 the new National Health Service Hospital Advisory Service sent teamsof professional officers to visit all hospitals for the mentally handicapped in morethan half of the English hospital regions and in the whole of Wales.     In his firstAnnual Report the Director has this to say about the management of hospital services for the mentally handicapped,,&quot;Many hospital staff have criticised their Regional Boards and theDepartment of Health for failing to provide a modern policy, plan modernprovision, or indeed give the leadership needed in recent years.......The visiting teams have found that Management Committees also vary considerably in their attitudes.    Many are very conscientious and visitregularly, but often restrict their interest to the social activities orimmediate physical conditions.     In general, however, many seem fearful ofinnovation and tend to accept the matters put before them by the senior officials of the hospitals.     It is rare to hear of a Management Committeeasking about the organisation of the therapeutic services in the hospital, orfor information which would confirm that the senior staff are workingeffectively together, or planning for the development of the therapeuticservices.    I hear that Management Committees are rightly concerned that theyshould not interfere isdth individual clinical judgment or with professionaldecisions in generals,     On the other hand, they seem unduly fearful of showingany interest or concern over the way the therapeutic services are developingor the general pattern of care or therapeutic atmosphere within the hospitalas a whole9One conclusion to be drawn from the teams&apos; visits is that one of the mostserious defects in the hospital services for the mentally handicapped lies inthe failure of the senior medical, nursing and administrative staff to meet together to discuss the services provided by the hospital and to plantogether for the future.    Many hospitals fail to plan the therapeuticresources at their disposal so as to use them to best effect for the populationconcerned.    It has frequently proved necessary to advise that some kind ofmulti-disciplinary planning committee should be formed to ensure that all thetherapeutic groups meet and agree on a co-ordinated plan for the hospital.Some hospitals have been successful with planning committees including allheads of departments and representatives of ward staff.......It is difficult to convey to those who have no experience of the problems,the stress imposed on ward staff.    For example, two nurses may beresponsible for rousing, dressing and toiletting 50 or so se-gerelyhandicapped patients, most of whom cannot dress themselves without some help,and many are incontinent or become so with minimum waiting.    In this
situation there may be only two toilets available in the dormitory area.The same ward may have no room for occupational or social therapy, thehospital departments concerned may be too small and none of the patients mayleave the ward from one week to the next.    These conditions are the fault of management at all levels, not of ward staff, and the latter are understandablyresentful of criticism they have sometimes received.&quot;But he also says: -&quot;We have found ample evidence of good practices and new ideas in every aspect of the hospital service for the mentally handicapped.    At Regional Boardlevel significant contributions to the development of the hospital services for the mentally handicapped have been apparent. ......The beneficial effects of Management Committees have also been apparent.In particular, in Wales the team were impressed by the attitude of theManagement Committee and staff of a chest hospital which had agreed to accepta group of mentally handicapped patients although the hospital had had no experience of such patients in the past.    There seemed little doubt that theinterest and enthusiasm of the Management Committee had played a significantpart in making a success of this new venture.    At another hospital which had had serious difficulties, the beneficial influence of a recently appointed chairman and interested Management Committee was apparent at all levels of thehospital&apos;s activities.The teams have noted the widespread benefits which follow when a consultantinvolves the other therapeutic professions in day-to-day work, assessment and continuing treatment.    They have noted the benefits which follow once heprovides an increasing service within the community, particularly in out-patient clinics or in meeting parents&apos; groups.    In view of the fact that theamount of time a consultant can give to eaoh individual patient is limited,the most effective services have often been those where the consultant takesparticular care to see that he enables other therapeutic professional staff toplay their full role0 8,,....Teams have seen nurses who take an active part in social training, help toplace their patients in suitable situations in the community, and run an effective follow-up service for their patients.     On wards, morale isooftensignificantly higher where the ward nurse has a major say in the pattern of care in the ward, ward design and decoration, and the right to take relevantdecisions for the individual patient.    In the better hospitals it is usual tofind that the ward staff have a good relationship with visiting relatives andare able to give them information on progress. ....../        In the quality of management, as&apos;in most other aspects, standards varywidely from one hospital to another.
General comment on hospital servicesFundamentally, what has happened is that outdated views have continuedto influence the allocation of financial and other resources to many hospitalsfor the mentally handicapped.      In some places attitudes have not kept pace with new knowledge   about the latent capacities of the mentally handicapped,public expectations of better services and the general rise in the standard ofliving.     Too little account has been taken of the increasing burden placed onthe hospital staff by changes in the make-up of the patient population.But these generalisations are unfair if they give the impression thatstandards are low everywhere.      Despite the difficulties outlined in this chapter some hospitals provide a very high standard of care indeed for mentally handicapped patients.      Almost all hospitals have some good features.Average standards compare well with those in many other developed countries.Within the hospitals forward-looking ideas abound.      The fact that so muchhas been achieved with such inadequate resources is a tribute to the staff, andin particular to the nurses, on whom the deficiencies weigh most heavily, andon whom criticism has often been unfairly focussed.43
r*o M  1 nP NT! A LSuccess in rehabilitation of patientsp0 Finally, it should be made clear that these hospitals do not have a whollystatic population.     In spite of the lack of residential homes outside, and theproblems inside,the hospitals have succeeded in rehabilitating and discharging patients in all age-groups, including children and the elderly.Ill Relevant figures are given in Table 4.    They relate to the total numbers in hospital in Table 2 (paragraph     . ), but exclude patients admitted for short-termcare of less than 3 months who, though they now account for well over half theadmissions each year, occupy only about J)% of the beds at any one time.\]%        Between 1954 and 1964 there was a substantial increase both in admissions anddischarges.     Both have fallen slightly since 1964.     Even with the present very limited facilities for care outside hospital, particularly residential accommodation,one patient in every twenty is discharged each year;   of these about half areof admission.discharged within two years /About a third of all discharges take place after morethan five years in hospital. More patients leave the hospitals each year throughdischarge than through deaths44

CHAPTER 5.     THE SERVICES REQUIREDGENERAL PRINCIPLES(Z-&quot;?      The main principles on which, according to current thinking, services for the mentally handicapped and their families should be based were summarised in Chapter 3*     The description of present services in Chapter kshows how far we are from applying them fully.     The present Chapter describesin more detail the component parts of the services we should now aim toprovide.     Chapter 6 describes the action in haafil or needed to achieve this,and Chapter 7 the important contribution which voluntary service can make.Collaboration between authorities and between professions(2C(-    The mentally handicapped and their families need help from professionsworking in services administered by a variety of authorities and departments.It is &apos; important that the resources of the health services,personal social services and education services should be deployed in close and effective collaboration.     Only if this is done can the relevantprofessional skills be most effectively used to provide complete andco-ordinated services.Main services required\7J$    The main services required are:&quot;(i)   Prevention or early detection of mental handicap so far as practicable,(ii)   Comprehensive assessment of the mentally handicapped person&apos;s assets and disabilities, and periodic reassessment,(iii)   Co-ordinated advice, support and practical help for their families,(iv) Education, social and work training, day care and occupation orthe opportunity for work according to the handicapped person1sindividual capacities.
(v).   Residential accommodation according to individual needs.(vi)   Hospital medical, nursing and other services for those who require them, as out-patients, day patients or in-patients.METHODS OF PREVENTION AND EARLY DETECTIONLimited but increasing knowledgeAt present the possibilities of preventing mental handicap are very limited.     The principal methods at present available are described in the Appendix.Most of these are quite recent and not yet widely applied, and most are atthe research stage.Genetic   counselling with family planning advice and treatment havepreventive possibilities.     Research is still being carried out into theearly antenatal detection of Down&apos;s Syndrome (mongolism).     Expert careduring labour has been shown to reduce the incidence of handicaps associatedwith the hazards of birth.     Evidence is becoming available to show thatintensive care for babies can lower the incidence of handicaps after birth.12? . Regular developmental screening of young children, particularly those at special risk, is essential to detect as early as possible deviant mentaldevelopment.There is evidence that mild degrees of mental handicap among culturallydeprived children can be improved by pre-school education and by help &quot;fortheir families.Organisation for prevention and detectionl^0 .       It is important that these preventive measures (and others which may become available as research increases our knowledge of the causes of mentalhandicap) should be known and used.     Doctors and nurses in general practice47
and domiciliary health services and in hospitals should all be concerned withthis, as should social workers and others who are in touch with parents orprospective parents.     A co-ordinated organisation is needed to achieve this;it should include a reliable recording system to help in keeping under reviewall children at risk of developing mental or physical handicaps.COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENTMulti-disciplinary approaohAs soon as any defect is detected or suspected, a comprehensiveassessment of the nature of the handicap or handicaps, and of the needs and problems of the handicapped person and his family, is required.     Medical,educational, psychological and social aspects should be considered together,as appropriate to the age of the child.     No one person can be expected to possess the range of skills required;   a multi-disciplinary approach is needed.(3i      Multi-disciplinary assessment should be repeated at intervals, as thehandicapped child or adult grows and develops.     The members of the assessmentteam will vary according to the handicapped person&apos;s age and current problems,Assessment and reassessmentWhen mental handicap is detected or suspected in a young child, importantase&amp;bers ef the assessment team will be a paediatrician concerned in the assessment and care of handicapped children^    . a consultant in psychiatry^ andOther experts in medicine, education, psychology, nursing and social work.The family doctor should always be involved as well as others concerned with support for the family,such as the health visitor and social worker.     Reassessment of progressshould be made frequently during childhood.13^      As the child grows older, educational and social assessment become increasingly important. Handicapped adolescents and  adultsneed special assessment of their vocational and social capacities and skilled48
new buildings, though in some places an addition to an existing buildingmay help.     A multi-disciplinary team can also meet in a health centre, anout-patient clinic, an adult training centre, a special sEhool   , aresidential home or a hospital, whichever is most convenient and appropriate for discussing the assessment and progress of individual children or adults.ADVICE AND PRACTICAL HELP FOR THE FAMILYCounselling$4        When handicap is first detected, the parents must be told this sympatheticallyand skillfully.     They need help in understanding the nature of their child&apos;s handicap, an experienced view of what to expectfrom the child and of the likely family problems a6 he grows older, and advice on how the family itself can best help the handicapped child todevelop his abilities to the full.     They also need a realistic appraisal of^including voluntary services,the services available/and information on how to obtain them.     If there isa co-ordinated multi-disciplinary approach to assessment there should be norisk of parents receiving conflicting advice.Parents also need help with problems of adjustment arising from theirown feelings towards a handicapped child, such as disappointment, sense of failure, anxiety about the future and concern for any other children in the for examplefamily. These personal difficulties can lead/to rejection of the handicapped childon the one hand,or over-protection on the other, either of which may have a lasting effecton the child1s future. The advice given to parents shouldtake into account the total family situation including the needs of other children so as to avoid subjecting them to deprivation or undue strain as aresult of the preoccupation of their parents with the handicapped child.I        Many people including general practitioners, health visitors, social/ psychiatrists and paediatricians,workers&apos;, have a contribution to make in advising parents, but their work must be co-ordinated.     As the child grows older his teachers and others concerned with his treatment or training should also contribute.     The personbest placed to act as co-coordinator is likely to be the social worker, who
should take her part in the multi-disciplinary team as soon as handicapis suspected and thereafter maintain a continuing relationship with thehandicapped child and his family.]42   ^    Many parents obtain relief and reassurance from contact with otherparents of mentally handicapped children.     The establishment of localparents&apos; groups in some areas has proved a valuable support.Practical assistance -&apos; . The family will also need practical assistance of many kinds.     this may include home-help, domiciliary nursing, laundry service for theincontinent, sitters-in, play centre, day nursery, nursery school, youthclub, and temporary residential care for the handicapped person duringemergencies or holidays.     Voluntary as well as statutory service will help,and may need to be invoked and co-ordinated by the social worker.     Servicesneeded for education, training, care and treatment during the day are described later in this Chapter.14^-,     Some families may also qualify for the new tax-free attendance allowance 4.80of/   pel week which will be available from December 1971 under Section 4of the National Insurance (Old persons&apos; and widows&apos; pensions and attendance allowance) Act 1970, where a severely disabled person at home requires care orattention day and night, or continual supervision for his own safety or that of othersThe family as a wholeK^b, The family should be told about these services and advised on their use.     This requires skilled evaluation of the real needs of the family,particularly of the mother.     Reassurance and personal guidance from the health visitor and social worker on how to care for her child herself may at times be more valuable to the mother than bringing in help from outside.At other times, however, in the interests of her own health and that of50
the rest of the family, a period of total relief from the daily routineof caring for the handicapped child or adult may be necessary.     Caringfor a mentally handicapped person at home makes     great calls on thefamily1s emotional reserve.     The essence of good community care isa.the availability of someone, usually the social worker, from whom theycan confidently expect understanding and help to meet any situation.Leaving the family homeIf and when the time comes for the handicapped person to leave the family home and enter residential care or hospital for more than atemporary stay, this should be planned well in advance so as to cause theleast possible distress to the family and upset to the handicapped person.The full co-operation of the family will be needed to help him to settle in his new environment.     Ideally, this will be close to his family home.But if it is not, additional practical help may be called for in the formof transport, or sitting-in services for other children to allow the parentsto visit.     Extra help may be needed in the home when the handicappedperson comes home for weekends or for a longer holiday.     The tax-freemattendance allowance mentioned in para. 5 &quot;23 will be payable if thecircumstances justify it, either for the full weekCs) of the holidayor on a daily basis.if the severely handicapped persion is at home for less than aweek at a time.5!
EDUCATION FOR CHILDRENPre-schooll^y        Mentally handicapped children need the stimulus of companionship with other children and adults.    Reoent research has demonstrated the value of an earlystart to the slow process of social training and education.     This can begin in thediagnostic or assessment centres run by some local education authorities, innursery schools, in special classes,in the special schools hitherto called juniortraining centres or in day nurseries or play-groups.    Very severely handicapped children may benefit by going each day to a hospital if the family can manage to provide the necessary care at other times.    Any of these arrangements not only benefits the child;   it also frees the mother for some hourseach day.Change in responsibility for education\l&amp; On 1 April 1971 local education authorities became responsible for theeducation and training of all mentally handicapped children.    The &quot;junior trainingcentres&apos; previously provided by local health authorities are now run by looaleducation authorities as separate special schools for educationally subnormalchildren, apart from a very few centres for which some other form of educationalorganisation has been considered appropriate.    Local education authorities are alsonow responsible for the education of all children in hospital.The value of play and exploration is recognised.    Many classrooms offer a variety oflearning situations arranged by the teacher to meet the needs of individual children,who learn less readily than normal children do from free activity methods.    emphasis is given to social adaptation and language development, to teaching each child tobe as independent as possible and to behave in a socially acceptable way.Already, before this transfer, many of the practices typical of normaleducation have been assimilated in training centres and hospitals.52
53ISO.Mentally handicapped children develop at different rates.     At 16some may still be very immature, needing the atmosphere and approach of theschool for a further year or so.      Others may be sufficiently mature to transfer to an adult centre, where they will be treated as young adults, given an increasingmeasure of responsibility and be prepared more consciously for the world of work.For some the transition may need to be in stages so that the young person cangradually gain confidence in the new environment.       In any case, carefulpreparation must be made for the transition by introducing pupils at school toa wide range of manual and creative skills, and for coming to terms with theeveryday world outside the school.
Benefits of the change/S/ The education service will build on the foundations laid by the health and hospital services.     Three of the main benefits expected from the change   are the availability of educational advice,      fuller professional training for the staff,and flexibility in placing children who up to now have been on the borderlinebetween the education and health authorities.(&quot;2 Children with severe mental handicap will no longer be excluded from the educational system, and it should become easier for those in hospitals to attendspecial schools in the community.    New special schools in the community should be planned with this dual intake in mind.     Such intermingling of children will become increasingly practicable as fewer children are admitted to large isolated hospitals and more to the smaller units in centres of population as recommended later in this chapter.    At the same time within hospitals arrangements will .. be made t oprovide education for those heavily handicapped children who in the past have oftanbeen denied education for lack of a &apos;school in the hospital or of teaching stafftheto visit them in/wards.SPECIAL CARE,..Kl The functions of special care units, for children and for adults, aid the scope for their development were described in paragraphs . ,   The best arrangementsneed to be worked out in consultation by local education authorities, the localauthorities&apos; health and social services departments and the hospital authorities.Joint arrangements may be needed, especially for adults.and social/WGHK TRAINING-, OCCUPATION AND FURTHER EDUCATION FOR ADULTSNeed for special training and occupationMost mildly handicapped school-leavers are able to go directly into open orsheltered employment, possibly with special help from the Youth Employment Service.Some need a period of special training in an adult training centre first.Most of the severely handicapped also need to attend an adult training centra.;   some may proceed from this to sheltered or open employment, butthe majority need permanently some form of work or occupation specially geared totheir limited capabilities.
work or occupation and tois to develop work habits/increase self-reliance generally, so as to. help each handicapped person to live a more independent life.    Theprogramme should include further education and facilities for social and recreational activities.    Much of the work needs to be simple and repetitive orcapable of being broken down into simple ^elements , but some mentally handicappedpeople obtain quite a high degree of skill which allows more sophisticatedprocesses to be introduced.OrganisationLocal authorities are responsible for providing these services for the mentally handicapped who live with their families or in other residential homes.All mentally handicapped patients in hospital need similar services, and many maybenefit from coming out    of the hospital daily to join others in the localauthorities&apos; adult training oentres.     In some places, handicapped people notliving in hospital may go to industrial or occupational training units in thehospital.     There is scope for considerable joint use of services.Full use should also be made of services which though not providedprimarily for the mentally handicapped can make a valuable contribution to meeting their needs.      For those who are capable of remunerative employmentthere are the services of the Department of Employment, viz:-(i)   The service of Disablement Resettlement Officers in findingsuitable employment, mainly in ordinary industry but if necessaryin special workshops under sheltered conditions (see (ii) below).They can also advise local authorities and hospitals on the sort of jobs which are available locally, and in suitable cases arrangeadmission to an Industrial Rehabilitation Unit (see (iii) below).55
(ii)   Sheltered Workshops are provided, with financial help fromthe Department of Employment, nationally by Remploy Limited,locally by local authorities, and for special classes of people by voluntary bodies.     Their purpose is to providework for disabled people who though capable of making a significant contribution are unlikely because of the severity of their disability to obtain employment under ordinaryconditions.(iii)   Industrial Rehabilitation.     The Department of Employmentoperate industrial rehabilitation units to provide for disabledpeople reconditioning for work and assessment as to the mostsuitable form of employment.      The facilities are available to people with mental handicap who need preparation for return towork.     Some workshops run by voluntary organisations and onerun by a local authority are recognised by the Department ofEmployment as providing, on an agency basis, industrial rehabilitation for people with mental handicap.      Theseworkshops receive limited financial assistance from theDepartment of Employment.56
RESIDENTIAL ACCOMMODATIONA local authority responsibilityIf and when a mentally handicapped child or:adult has to leave his family home,a suitable substitute home must be provided.     Some will need to go to hospitalbecause of physical handicaps or behaviour problems that require special medical,nursing or other skills.     The local authorities have a statutory duty to provideresidential care   for all others, and also for those who can leave hospital after aperiod of treatment there.Various formsResidential care may be with foster parents, in lodgings, ordinary     housing    crviStV. soi&apos;t*\ work Swy^ortTja group home or flatlets^ a children&apos;s home, a home for the elderly mentally infirm,or a home (local authority or voluntary) specifically for mentally handicapped children or adults.    The choice depends on the age, handicap and degree of socialindependence of each handicapped person.To give scope for progress to lesser or greater support as time goes on, eachlocal authority should provide   a    range of choice.    A recent and useful trend isto have a small residential home with flatlets or a group home nearby, or even in thesame building structure.    This makes progress to lesser support possible withoutuprooting the handicapped people from the community they know and cutting their linksfamiliarwith /   friends.;57
Homes not hostelaThe term &quot;home is deliberately used in this Paper in preference to *hostel&apos;,which is usually used at present.    The word &quot;hostel9 has the ring of impermanenceand a certain austerity.     It usually describes a place where people stay whileworking or studying, away from their home.    But residential homes for the mentally handicapped are a permanent substitute family home for most of theresidents, even though they keep in touch with their own families and visit them asoften as possible.    The staff and residents become a substitute family group.The home should be homely.In fact most of the present local authority 1hostels&apos; do have this homelyatmosphere.     It is better to call them &quot;homes&apos; when a generic term is needed.Each should normally be known by its own individual name, or street number, as anyother house is.((J3 Homes of this kind will supply much of the residential care needed.    Theyshould be small, and usually have residents of both sexes.    For adults, 25 is nownormally the maximum for a single home, and 20 the maximum for children;   many maybe smaller.    Most adults should have single rooms, and no rooms have more than fourbeds.    Plenty of space for recreation is needed, indoors and outside.     Residentsshould use local parks and sports grounds, and shops.     In such surroundings a family atmosphere can be created, where individuals can develop within a small group and with their own interests and possessions.Personal relationshipsPersonal relationships between the handioapped child oraadult, the family hehas. just left, and the new foster parent or landlady or staff of the residentialhome are very important.     The mentally handicapped need the security which corneafrom the personal interest of people they know and trust.     Contacts with their ownfamily or with social workers they already know should therefore be maintained, and anew lasting relationship formed with the people in their new substitute home.58
Anyone chosen to look after the mentally handicapped must be a person able toestablish such lasting relationships, but not be over-proteotive.     Given someone to turn to for help with problems of ordinary life many mentally handicapped people canachieve considerable independence but this has to be positively encouraged,!(,(, Social workers should work with the family and with the staff of theresidential home, the foster-parent or landlady.    They should also be in contact withother people as need arises eg the teacher, the manager      of the training oentre,the employer, the DfiO, the club leader or voluntary worker.Personal help[H In future, when only those really requiring hospital care are admitted to hospital, local authority hoses will receive residents in need of more personal care and help than most present residents.     These will include people who require somehelp in feeding, washing or dressing themselves, or have minor emotional problems,or who might come to harm if not escorted when they go out.     Older as well asyounger children and even some adults may have occasional incontinence.    This doesnot go beyond the type of personal attention which local authorities are accustomed toprovide in children1 s homes and homes for the elderly.Activities\lo% Most residents should go by day to a special school, to an adult trainingoantre or to some other occupation or employment outside the home.    They should so be encouraged to do the sort of household jobs people normally do in their owns.    In every way, their activities should be as nearly the same as those of people in a normal home environment as their handicaps permit.Weekly boarders^ In addition to permanent residents, places in residential homes are alsoneeded for children and adults who live too far away from a special school or adult training centre for daily travel and will wish to spend five days a week, goinghome at weekends.
Short-term carej70 Homes should also be ready to provide short-term care for other mentally handicapped children and adults in emergencies or to give those with whom thehandicapped person is living an opportunity for a holiday.      This is a vitalfactor in enabling families to keep a mentally handicapped relative at home;it applies also to foster parents and to landladies.      To some extent the demand is seasonal;   some homes specially for holidays, open for only part of the year,may be useful.Patients discharged from hospitaltl( It is the responsibility of the local authority social services departmentto provide any social work support needed for patients after discharge fromhospital, and where necessary to find them suitable residential accommodation.This should be done in consultation with the hospital staff.     In some areashospital staff at present have to find lodgings or residential employment for patients who are ready for discharge but have no home to go to.     Such arrange-ments may not be successful unless accompanied by social work support, whichthe local authority social worker should provide.      She will usually be betterplaced, too, through her local knowledge, to find suitable landladies orarrange admission to a local authority home or to a private or voluntary homeregistered by the authority.      The local authority&apos;s general duties for the care of the mentally handicapped enable them to make a financial contribution towards the cost of accommodation, including lodgings, which hospitals haveno power to do.The elderlyJ72. Table 2 in paragraph shows the large increase in recent years inthe number of people over age 55 in hospitals for the mentally handicapped.Table k at the end of Chapter h shows that increasing numbers are beingadmitted when already aged 55 or over, and considerable numbers discharged.
Many of these probably require residential rather than hospital care.     Localauthorities need to consider what services they should be providing for the growing numbers of elderly mentally handicapped people.At present, no special provision is made for this group and our information about the problem is sketchy.     But relevant information will soon be available from the censuses mentioned at the end of Chapter 2.     These will tell us thenumber in different age groups at present in hospital and in residential homes,and the severity of their handicap(s) and other characteristics.     With this information it should be possible to estimate the number of elderly mentally handicapped people for whom services should be planned.61
/HOSPITAL SERVICES,. :   At present, for reasons explained in Chapter 4, hospitals are used as homes formany who, when admitted, really required residential care of the sort described inparagraphs &apos; J  &quot;$-taOXAs local authority services develop, this should cease.There are different opinions, even among the experts, on the extent to which local authority services can meet the needs of people with substantial but notprofound mental handicap, with or without associated physical handicap, and on theextent to which such people require medical, nursing or other skills which it is the function of hospitals to provide.    As the local authority services develop, this willbecome clearer.     The rest of this Chapter assumes that many will require hospital services, as out-patients, day-patients or in-patients, and that some can best be served by a combination of local authority and hospital services.     Tentativeestimates of the numbers of mentally handicapped people requiring various services aregiven at the end of the Chapter.general services to be usedWhen a mentally handicapped person requires hospital treatment for a physicalillness, or surgery, or treatment for mental illness, he should normally receivethis in the appropriate department of a general or mental illness hospital.    Theremay however be cases where psychiatric treatment for a mental illness associated withsevere mental handicap, or occasionally treatment for physical illness, is betterprovided in a hospital or unit accustomed to dealing with the severely mentally handicapped.62
63Paragraphs Wo to Utl    mention the need for hospital staff to participate inthe prevention, early detection and comprehensive assessment and reassessment of mental and other handicaps.     Children&apos;s departments of general hospitals have animportant part to play in diagnosis and assessment and early remedial measures.Psychiatric out-patient clinics in local hospitals are also useful for this purpose.The contacts thus established between hospital psychiatrists and handicapped children or adults and their parents also help to support the family while thehandicapped member lives at home, and to ease the transition to hospital if heneeds to be admitted later.
Day hospital services17^ Day hospital services are needed for handicapped children or adults who canlive at home but need assessment in a hospital setting.     They are also required forsome of      / severethose with&apos;physical handicaps or behaviour problems whose families can keep them athome if relieved of their care for a few hours each day.    For such patients dayservices may replace or postpone in-patient admission , or allow discharge after aperiod as an in-patient,(7*        Day patients may attend hospitals which also treat in-patients, or separateday hospitals.     Any hospital taking day-patients must of course be easilyaccessible to the population it serves.    For some patients relatively simpleaccommodation will suffice, and may be in a small local unit.     Others will needtreatment facilities which can be provided only in a larger hospital.     In additionto whatever medical, nursing and other specialist services are needed, there must be/in the hospital or nearbyfacilities/for education for children and suitable occupation and training for adults, and also meals and recreation.    Paragraph  3 refers to the possibility of associating day hospital services in some areas with a training centre or specialschool provided by the local authority.In-patient treatmentjgD    .  In-patient services are needed for those who can no longer remain in the familyhome or in other residential care and require treatment or training under specialistmedical supervision or constant nursing care.    A high proportion will need this because their mental handicap is associated with severe physical disability orbehaviour disorder.fgj       The aim is to help all patients, including the most severely handioapped, todevelop to their full potential and to achieve as positive and independent a lifeas their handicaps allow.    After a period of treatment or training some will be ableto be discharged back to life in the community with support from the localauthorities or hospital out-patient or day-patient services,
Staff for positive therapya* The hospitals should be staffed to provide all necessary medical, dental andpara-medical services,,    In addition to doctors, dentists and nurses, this may require, according to individual patients&apos; needs, the services of whole-time or part-time psychologists, physiotherapists, speech therapists and other specialists.A range of educational services for patients of all ages should be provided by or   inconsultation with the local education authority, together with industrial and occupational therapy and a range of leisure activities for whioh appropriate staff need to be employed.Management of co-ordinated therapeutic programmes hospital management, through its chief officers, should provide for theco-ordination of therapeutic programmes.    All those concernedwith patients should contribute to this, including teachers and instructors,occupational and other therapists as well as doctors, nurses and professionaladainistrators.Efforts now being made to encourage this are described in Chapter 6.Home in hospitalWhether a patient stays in hospital a relatively short time or a long time thehospital becomes in effect his home as well as a place of treatment.     The conditions and general atmosphere should be as homelike as possible, with every appropriatestimulation through education, industrial or occupational therapy and leisure/patientactivities, and personal possessions for every ..If staff are allocated to care for small groups of patients, individual attention can more easily be given and personalrelationships established.     The principles mentioned in paragraphs )4t   to and in\b$ apply in hospitals just as much as in residential homes.Contacts with the family\%         Admission to hospital should have no air of a final break with the patient&apos;sfamily, as it often has at present.    The hospital staff should be at pains toensure that their own professional services do not make the relatives feelsuperfluous, nor guilty at shedding their immediate responsibility for the65
handicapped person.     A family&apos;s inability to carry on caring for a severelyhandicapped child or adult should not be seen by them as a failure, or as an occasion for them to withdraw their interest.      The points mentioned inparagraph   1^ apply in this situation.If the hospital employs its own social workers, they should maintainclose links with the local authority social services departments to ensure a continuing service to families while their relative is in hospital, and tosecure proper arrangements if and when he is discharged.        Another possiblearrangement is for the local authority to provide a social work service, usedjointly with the hospital, for patients from the authority&apos;s area and their families;   the same social workers would then be responsible whether or not thehandicapped member of the family becomes a hospital in-patient.     If a hospitalin-patient has no family links, the local authority social worker can providea contact with the community;    this may be particularly necessary if the patientis a child.If contacts with the family are to be maintained, the hospitals must beaccessible to the populations they serve.      This will affect both the locationand the size of hospitals or hospital units for the mentally handicapped, whichare discussed in paragraphs   1%^   4*1^2. end in Chapter 6.Contacts with the surrounding community; Contact should be maintained with life outside hospital through contacts with the local community around the hospital, as well as with patients&apos; families.Voluntary help and visitors from the local community should be encouraged tocome into the hospital.     Patients should go out to shop, to use local parks and playgrounds and join in social events;   even severely handicapped patientscan benefit from the interest and stimulus this provides.      Some may also go out of the hospital regularly to work or to attend adult training centres or special schools.
Size and location of hospitalsDifferent viewsOft Most of the points made in paragraphs   Ilk r&quot;o        are accepted inprinciple by those now concerned with hospital services for the mentally handicapped.But there are different opinions about the best size and location of hospitalsor hospital units.Some consider that there should be no seperate hospitals of the presentsort for the mentally handicapped, and that general hospitals should meet allthe hospital needs of the population of the districts they serve, including the mentally handicapped.     Thus mentally handicapped children would be looked afterin units associated with the children&apos;s department, and mentally handicappedadults in small units at, or operationally linked with, the general hospital.Education, training and occupation for many of the patients  would be provided in the training centres used by other mentally handicapped persons living inthe community.      It is argued that this is right in principle, would make it easier to recruit staff, would overcome problems of professional isolation,would help patients retain their links with the local population, would make itmuch easier for relatives to visit and would overcome the problems of asegregated community,j^l        Others favour larger specialised hospitals as in the present hospital service, though not so large as to be extremely remote from most of theirpopulation.     In such hospitals, they say, it is easier to provide a wide range of services for occupation, training and recreation.     It is argued that onlya hospital which brings together the mentally handicapped from a wide area canbe large enough to classify patients with varying degrees or types of handicap,separate them in different wards and villas and provide the right tempo of life for each.      It is also suggested that this type of hospital is necessaryin order to allow staff to specialise in the care of the mentally handicappedand promote research into their problems and treatment.
The Government&apos;s viewjfj^ The Government considers it premature to form a final view on thesequestions.      Experience of various solutions is necessary to test the theoriesin practice.      The Government is therefore encouraging alternative lines ofdevelopment within the general principles mentioned in Chapter 3 and paragraphs17^ to The action now being taken to achieve this is described in chapter 6.Pattern and scale of services required.As present services, described in Chapter 4, are a far cry from our currentideals, we have little practical experience on which to base estimates of thescale on which we need to develop the various component parts of a new system.The surveys described in Chapter 2 are intended to help towards such estimates, but have their limitations.        They record people known to theauthorities to be mentally handicapped, and therefore do not measure unkown need.They also necessarily reflect the present pattern of services;   improved services may change requirements.Estimating the number of places required - for training or occupation, inresidential homes, and in hospitals for day patients and in-patients - is amatter of judgment.      Estimates, therefore, vary considerably even among thosewho have studied the subject closely.      They are affected by the differences of opinion on the role of doctors and nurses mentioned in paragraph J7S&quot; and by different views on the pattern of hospital services mentioned in paragraphsiTl     if 2.      Any estimates made now as a basis for planning services will need to be adjusted in the light of experience and further research.4       On this tentative and provisional basis, Table 5 sets out guidelines forthe numbers of places of various kinds per 100,000 population, and overall for england and Wales, which seem likely to be needed if services were fully developed along the lines described in this Chapter.      They take no account ofexpected population increase nor of longer survival of the severely handicapped.confidei&amp;Sal

CHAPTER 6.   ACTION TO IMPROVE SERVICES\6\&apos;j Our task is to reorganise and improve our services to meet the requirementsoutlined in Chapters 3 and 5*      This requires sustained action over many years bylocal authorities, by hospital authorities and others in the National health service, by voluntary bodies and by central government.        This Chapter describes the programmes of action which have been started, what they will cost and how soonthey should achieve their targets.      It also emphasises the need for joint planning and co-ordination of progress between local authority and hospitalprogrammes.     The important role of voluntary services is discussed in Chapter 7-LOCAL AUTHORITY SERVICESNew priorityNo new policy is involved for local authority services.     What is neededis faster progress to overcome the present deficiencies.      This will requiremoney and more trained staff.     The Government will play its part, but the mainresponsibility lies with the local authorities themselves.     Faster developmentof their services is crucial, and must be a main task of their new Social ServicesCommittees.     Members and officers must meet the challenge of fulfilling their duty to provide a full range of services for the mentally handicapped in thecommunity.Targetsl^fj      Table 5 at the end of Chapter 5 sets out for the first time quantitativetargets for those parts of the local authority services which depend on buildingsas well as on staff.      It is not possible to set similar targets for increasingthe numbers of social workers, home helps, play-group organisers and similar staff.The need for more such staff is great, but the mentally handicapped and their families are only one group among many for whom their services are required;any estimate of numbers related to the mentally handicapped alone would not bemeaningful.The figures in Table 5 are tentative.      They must be tested in the light of experience, and adjusted to changes in population.     But they give each localauthority a clear provisional target for each of the services listed in the Table.CONFIDENTIAL
most cases these targets are far beyond what the authorities have yet planned toprovides oEXPANSION OF RESIDENTIAL HOMES AND . ADULT TRAINING- CENTRES,2,01       The services in which the greatest expansion is needed are adult trainingcentres or sheltered workshops, residential homes for children and residentialhorns for adults0Building *g figjgSol     The target in Table 5 for adult training centres requires 43,500 more places in adult training centres than were in use or under construction in March 1971*A further 2,000 new places may be needed to replace existing unsatisfactorybuildings.    Some 9*700 of these 459500 plaoes would be for hospital patients, for whom the hospital authorities would reimburse an appropriate share of running costsincluding loan charges;   the running oosts of 35*800 plaoes in addition to thesenow in existence or under construction  would fall to be met by the localauthorities, with help from the rate support grant.lo^    The Table 5 targets for residential homes for children and adults, excludingplaces in foster homss5 lodgings^ - etc, require 2,800 more places for children and 24,100 for adults in addition to those now in use or under construction,,Capital investment and running costs2ott    The capital cost of this number of additional plaoes in residential homes andadult training centres would be about  154 million at 1970 prices.    The running costs,including loan charges^ falling on local authorities when these places and those nowunder construction are in use would be about  38    million (at 1970 prices) inaddition to the cost of services of this sort in 1970-71, which was about 14    million a    These figures include the cost of places in voluntary or privateresidential homes, but not of plaoes in foster homes, lodgings   ecc.
tote of progress increasing2oJj&quot;&apos;       The pace of development of residential homes and adult training centres isalready quickening.     Capital investment in terms of projects started has risenin 1959-60from less than  1 m./    to nearly  5.2m. in 1970-71, and is expected to reach  7m.in 1971-72.The 1970-71 and 1971-72 figures reflect tka- added impetus given by the policies and their government&apos;a/deciaion in November 1970 to allocate  40m. additional capital and revenue resources to local authority and hospital services for the mentally handicapped for the four years 1971-2 and 1974-75, and by the agreements reached inthe negotiations on rate support grant for the years 1971-73*The neat 4 years^1     .  In the four years 1971-72 to 1974-75, these resources and local authorities&apos;present plans should allow building starts for nearly 10,000 new places in adult training centres, 750 new places in homes for children and 3,500 new places inis for adults.    New buildings would increase revenue costs during this period byan average of SometK^ uwj/t-  2m. each year over the previous year at. 1970 prices. This/&apos;slightly higher than the present annual increase which is likely in 1971-72 to exceed  1.5m* for the first time.   The annual increase would rise progressively duringths 4-year period.ggfM-fil^tin^ thift programme2cH        Ptarther progress will depend on what rate of development can reasonably beexpected, taking into aocount the priority which these servicesdeserve and the many other oalls on resources.     Bearing in mind the need todevelop other services for the mentally handioapped, including social workers andother domiciliary services and eduoation, and also the other important services forwhich local authorities are responsible, it seems reasonable to envisage capital investment in residential homes for mentally handioapped children and adults   ii*and adult training oentres rising by about 2$ a year for the next 10 years from the
 7m. expected in 1971-72.     On this basis capital investment should reach nearly 8.5m a year in 1970 prices in 1981-82.      Thereafter capital investment might continue at at least that level until the targets are reached.      This would involve an annual increase in revenue costs of about  2   m. each year.Jy\ At that rate of progress, we could expect to have in use or under constructionby 1986-7 about 5^*600 more places in adult training centres than are in use orunder construction now, about 2,250 more places in residential homes for children and 18,600 more places in homes for adults.      If the planning figures in Table 5were still valid at that time, this would leave a need for some 11,000 more places in adult training centres, 550 places in homes for children and 5*500 places inhomes for adults, subject to increase or decrease to take account of populationchanges;   this might take up to five years to complete at the same rate of progress.9^ The Government must necessarily express targets and forecasts in nationalterms.      This national forecast of progress covers a time-span long enough forevery authority to build up its services to the level of the planning targets.But some authorities would move faster than others, and some whose presentservices are better developed have less far to go and could expect to reach theirtargets earlier - some even within ten years.      Individual authorities will need to work out their own programmes, and co-ordinate them with the redevelopment of hospital services for their areas.      So far as the resources available for capital projects allow, the Government will try to help authorities to complete their programmes within the time-span they set themselves;   where necessary,priority must be given where the need is greatest.EXPANSION OF OTHER SERVICES&amp;\\ For the reasons explained in paragraph ^^quantitative targets cannot beset for the recruitment of social workers, home helps and other staff fordomiciliary services for the mentally handicapped and their families.     But some
allowance must be made for their cost in any forecast of rate of progress in local authority services for the mentally handicapped.     Increased use offoster homes, lodgings and sheltered housing, and increased day-care for children under five (for which planning figures are given in Table 5) must also be taken into account.     In assessing reasonable rates of progress forthe building of new adult training centres and residential homes in paragraphsIf)&quot;] folio, it has been assumed that as these services develop up to  lm.additional revenue expenditure may need to be incurred in any one year, and on average expenditure will rise over the whole period by at least  0.5m. ayear.     The rate of development will depend on the possibility of recruitingcertain types of staff such as home helps, or of finding suitable lodgings,the output of training programmes, and other factors some of which will beoutside individual authorities&apos; control.Education services also need development.     This is being planned bythe education departments and local education authorities who have recently taken over this responsibility.      Building programmes of approximately  lm.a year were in progress at 1st April 1971, and will continue at least atthis level while the integration of this provision with the services forspecial education proceeds and the full measure of the capital requirements are ascertained.     Arrangements are already in hand for substantial increases in the provision for training of teachers of mentally handicapped children.CO-ORDINATION WITH HOSPITALS-   .2.64- ^ 2-74 2.7^This is discussed more fully in paragraphs . .     Paragraphasks each local authority, in consultation with the hospital authorities fortheir area, to fix a date after which the hospitals will not be expected to admit, from that local authority&apos;s area, any more people who need residentialrather than hospital care.      In some areas this date should be within theperiod of the first four-year programme.      Discussions will be held with the
local authority associations about fixing a final date when this will applythroughout the country.      The main object of this is to prevent futuremisplacements.     It would also contribute to the relief of overcrowding in the hospitals.STAFF RECRUITMENT AND TRAININGShortage of staff, particularly trained staff, was mentioned in Chapter kas a limiting factor on the quality and further development of all parts of thelocal authority services for the mentally handicapped.     It is essential thatrecruitment and training of staff for training centres and residential homes andof social workers should expand in parallel with the rest of the development programme.      This will not be easy.      Training schemes for staff of adult training centres and residential homes have not been established long enoughyet to be well known gateways to a satisfying career.      For some years to comemethods of stimulating recruitment, as well as the extension of training, willbe one of the most important tasks of the authorities&apos; new social servicesdepartments and the new Central Council for Education and Training in social work.75
Adult training centre staff\r About 170 people are nov; qualifying each year for the Diploma in the teaching of mentally handicapped adults awarded by the Training Council for teachers of the Mentally Handicapped.      The Training Council are alive to theneed to expand staff training to keep pace with planned development of adult training centres and also to meet the needs of hospitals.Residential home staffSpecific training for the staff of residential homes, other than children&apos;shomes, has only recently started.      Experience abroad, notably in Denmark, hasshown how much trained staff can do to develop the potential of the mentally handicapped in residential care.      As the expansion of such care is so importanta part of our planning, it is essential to expand training facilities for staff as a matter of priority.]fj There are now an increasing number of courses in Colleges of further education for students wishing to work in residential homes, including homes for the mentally handicapped.     A few university courses in applied socialstudies provide options for students who wish to work in residential homes.Intensive in-service training for staff in post who find it difficult to take full time professional courses has been encouraged both by the Central council for Training in Child Care and by the Council for Training in Social Work.These Councils will soon be replaced by the new Central Council for education and Training in Social Work, as the body responsible for all social worktraining.      It will clearly need to consider a substantial and urgentdevelopment of full-time courses and in-service training.Social workers% The main training for social workers in the mental health services isprovided by postgraduate university courses in psychiatric social work, andthe courses leading to the Certificate in Social Work awarded by the council for Training in Social Work.     Holders of the Certificate in Social Work donot all take up work in mental health.confidential -ftgL
At present over 100 psycCi&amp;fclfLiDIMT^Alworkers qualify each year and considerable expansion is planned.     Expansion of courses for the Certificatein Social Work has been rapid.Certificate, and the first year intake had risen to 406 students.     In addition onethree-year course has started, and there are three one-year courses for olderexperienced staff of whom some 50 are at present in training.    The new central council will need to expand these training facilities very considerably to meet thedemands for trained social workers in all fields of social work.Local authorities&apos; programmesOne of the first tasks of the new social services department of each localauthority will be to formulate a     .. - training programme for these and other staff.    Each programme needs to include secondment to full-time courses and in-service training for each group of staff.    The programme should allow for advancerecruitment and secondment for training;   for example, it may be wise to select theparson to be in charge of a new residential home and second him for training whilethe home is being built, so that he is qualified and ready to take up his duties as soon as it opens.In l^lo-Tii there were 18 two-year courses leading to the
COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMESReorgani satisfaction on$11      When local authority services are fully developed fewer hospital beds formentally handicapped in-patients will be needed than we have now.    But many will need to be in different places.    New assessment and treatment facilities will be needed for out-patients, day-patients and in-patients.     Staff, buildings,equipment, furnishings and other essentials must be,sufficient in quantity and quality to provide all patients with good treatment and good living conditions.For this, hospital services in each region need to be reorganised.    Each regional hospital Board has been asked to work out a development programme to aohieve this.The pattern of development is described in paragraphs to $TiL .Five-year programme of improvements^23-      In some areas local authority services will not be fully developed for 15years or more, though they will be growing all the time with consequent relief to the hospitals,,    New hospital building will also take some time to plan and complete.In the meantime existing hospitals will continue to be used.    A five-year programme to improve conditions in these hospitals is therefore in hand, as well as longer-term plans of reorganisation.    This is described more fully in paragraphs  22.4.   toTransitional measures21&quot;^   The hospitals contain many patients who when first admitted needed residentialrather than medical or nursing care.    As local authority services develop newadmissions of this sort should cease, and more patients can be discharged fromhospital.2Xi\  Opinions differ on how many of those who have become institutionalisedthrough long residence in hospital can be successfully rehabilitated and return tolife in the general community.     Some maintain that between a third and a half of allpatients now in hospitals for the mentally handicapped could be discharged if
residential and other facilities were available in the community.     Others regardthese estimates as far too high.    Hospital Boards have been asked to include intheir development programmes accommodation of a domestic charaoter, within thehospital servioe, in which the possibility of rehabilitating institutionalisedpatients can be assessed in more normal living conditions.Links between these the longer-term, short-term and transitional measures are not separate, butparts of a co-ordinated programme.    New units for day-patients and in-patientswhich are provided early in the plans for reorganisation will also contribute to thefive-year programmes by relief of overcrowding and of pressures on staff.     So will2.2. if-some of the domestic-type units mentioned in paragraph        ;   these are also likelyto have a permanent place in the reorganised service.     The raising of standards toa sinumum acceptable level through the five-year programme of improvements will beof permanent benefit to those hospitals which will remain in use under the longer-term reorganisation   . All these developments interlock. *FIVE-mR PROGRAMME OF IMPROVEMENTSRegional Hospital.  At the end of 1969/Boards were given a list of &quot;interim measures to improvehospital services for the mentally handicapped&apos; and were asked to plan to achieve these within about 5 years starting in 1970-71.Some were expressed in terms of specific standards, others in more general terms.     Some of the specific standardswere minimum objectives, to be attained where the present conditions were worst, andwere acknowledged to be less than the desirable standard.    It was made clear that where standards were already higher, they should not be reduced to these levels.&quot;7       These interim measures included the improvement of patients&apos; food (to which the  top priority was to be given) and clothing, minimum space standards and maximumnumbers of patients in any one ward to relieve the worst of the overcrowding, theprovision of cupboards for all patients personal possessions, specific minumum
staff:   patient ratios for doctors, dentists and nurses and minimum numbers of domestic staff related to the size of the hospital and the degree of dependency of the patients; recruitment of staff for other forms of treatment, upgrading of buildings and furnishings^ and adequate staff accommodation.2.2%    They also included the establishment of regular discussions at ward level betweendoctors, nurses and other therapeutic staff, staff training schemes, the encouragement of voluntary servioe and where appropriate the employment of a full-time organiser of voluntary services.The previous Government exhorted Boards to reallocate money within their totalregional allocations for this purpose,  made extra specific allocations/year.totalling  3m. revenue in 1970-71, and reallocated  lm. capital in that&apos; they also indicated to Boards that further specific revenue allocations totalling atleast  Igm. would be made for 1971-7.2.23)0 The present Government has asked Boards to complete this programme of increased&apos; interim measures&apos;.     It has made available/re sources for the four years 1971-72 to1974-75    for this programme . and other developments for the mentally handicapped.    From these increased resources the further specificrevenue allocation for 1971-72 has been raised from the  l^m. promised bythe previous Government to  3^nuSTAFF TSAINING AND CONFERENCESxhe special training project23 \   The principal training need in the hospital service is reorientation of stafforiginally trained in an older tradition, and the interchange of new ideas andexperiences.    The programme of &apos;interim measures&apos;  was accompanied by a specialtrainingproject for this purpose. Its object is to help hospital staff now working withthe mentally handicapped, both senior and junior, to understand the principles on
which current policies are based, so that they will be able to take full advantageof the opportunities for more personal and positive patient care which the otherparts of the five-year improvements programme should bring to their hospitals.Many of the nurses and other staff have longed for just such an opportunity.    Wardstaff in particular need more opportunities than they have been given in the past towiden their horizons, for example   by exchanging ideas with other hospitals, and todevelop their own ideas about ways in which they may give their patients a fuller life.Most regions have appointed a special training project officer.    Most of theseare experienced nurses or administrators, who work closely with the RegionalTraining Officers.    Following a training course for the project officers inJuly 1970 a great many activities are now under way.    Regional conferences havebeen held to launch the scheme and multi-professional steering groups have beenformed to guide the programme within the region.    The training project concentrateson improving communication within and between hospitals. Methods includeseminars;   working parties on     subjects such as patients1 clothing;   inter-hospital visits;   training for new staff;   improved induction for newly recruitedstaff;   attitude surveys;   and conferences and discussions to promote closerliaison with local authorities and voluntary services.    Examples of good practice andof new methods of treatment have been publicised and brought to the notice of otherhospitalscKursg training the syllabus of training for the RNMS qualification has recently been reviewed by the General Nursing Council and a revised syllabus was published in November 1970.In compiling this syllabus the Council has had in mind the need to provide a training which gives a comprehensive insight into, and an understanding of, theproblems of the mentally handicapped.     The syllabus seeks to ensure that the nurseis fully conversant with all aspects of the care, education and training of the mentally handicapped both in the hospital and in the community.    It is set out in broad terms to permit adaptations as necessary to meet changing needs.81
^        A Committee under the chairmanship of Professor Asa Briggs is now consideringthe role, education and training of all nurses including those working with the mentally handicapped.Refresher trainingJ3J3      In order to maintain good standards, regular refresher training is necessaryfor qualified nurses and other professional staff.    Regional Hospital Boards havebeen asked to give renewed attention to this as part of the improvementsprogramme.Multi-disciplinary management23^ At the same time the Department of Health and Social Security has taken the lead in encouraging new methods of co-ordinated management. Many hospitals haveinherited a hierarchical staffing pattern with astonishingly little communication between different groups of staff - doctors, nurses,other therapeutic staff, and the professional administrators.    For effective management their work and objectives mucbe fully co-ordinated, within a general policy approved by the Hospital management committees    This implies the acquisition of new management skills.5^7    Training conferences to assist this are being held by Regional Hospital Boardsvdth the Department&apos;s help.     Boards are to follow these up in consultation withsenior staff in all their psychiatric hospitals.FUTURE PATTERN OF HOSPITAL SERVICESParagraphs 1^ fo 1 ^mentioned differences of opinion about the best size and location of hospitals or hospital units for the mentally handicapped, and theGovernment&apos;s view that alternative lines of development should be encouraged inorder to provide experience of different solutions.2-3^   Regional Hospital Boards have been told that their development programmes should provide for a range of assessment and treatment services for out-patients,day-patients and in-patients on the lines described in Chapter 5, and that they
should be based on the principles now set out in Chapter 3, points (xi) to (xiv) inparagraph   &quot; being particularly relevant to the planning of hospital services.2^.0 As to size and location of hospitals and hospital units, Boards have beenasked to proceed on the lines described in the following paragraphs.No new large hospitals24( The best of the present hospitals, and others when improved by the relief ofovercrowding, more staff, and better living conditions for patients, will give the necessary experience of large specialisedhospitals with which to compare other solutions.    No new hospitals of this typeare therefore to be built for the time being, nor any hospitals of 500 beds or moreenlarged.    This is not intended to prevent the addition of facilities for education, occupational or industrial therapy or special treatment, but it isintended to prevent any increase in the number of  in-patients.New building to relieve overcrowding at hospitals with 500 or more patients on one site is to be located in areas of population elsewhere in the hospital&apos;scatchment area.In hospitals with 500 or more patients on one site it may occasionally bevery lima, tednecessary to provide/additional residential space for patients to allow existing \wards to be vacated for upgrading.    In such cases the erection on site ofone system-built unit may be justified (provided it can be staffed).83
New accommodation for in-patients will be provided either in units forthe mentally handicapped within a hospital containing other departments as well, orin separate small or medium sized hospitals or hospital units.     Each new hospital or unit will provide, or contribute to, a comprehensive range of in-patient,out-patient and day facilities for the mentally handicapped for a defined district.Such districts should not exceed about 250,000 population (possibly more in adensely populated area) and should generally coincide with the district served byone (or possibly two) general hospitals.     These hospitals and units for the mentally handicapped will have close operational links with general hospitalsserving the same district or with existing hospitals for the mentally handicapped.Such hospitals or units will not contain more than 100-200 beds forin-patients (in addition to places for day-patients) and many will be considerablysmaller.     The reason for this upper limit of 100-200 beds is that, on the planning figures in Table 5, 200 in-patient beds would eventually be necessaryonly for a population well in excess of 250,000;   a hospital serving more peoplethan this would be too remove from many of them.Some of the smaller units will be for patients who, while requiringspecialist medical supervision, are capable of going out daily to a specialschool or adult training centre or to employment, or patients with friends orpreferablyrelatives living nearby.     These units should be homely in character, and/sitedin a residential area.     The living accommodation and social activities should bevery similar to those in local authority homes as described in paragraph        .Other similar small units may be used for the purpose described inparagraph For many patients such a unit will be a stepping-stone todischarge.     Others may remain for longer periods.84
85should not generally be actually on the general hospital site.     There must be-sufficient space for whatever occupational activities are needed by patients who do not go out from the hospital each day, and for leisure activities, and thebuildings must be homely in character.     This may be easier to achieve on aseparate but nearby site.     There may be an assessment and treatment unit in thegeneral hospital.Accommodation for childrenNew facilities for children will normally be separate from those for adults, have close links with the children&apos;s department of the general hospital and be provided in small domestic units.     They may be either on or off the site of the general hospital.     There may occasionally be situations where, bysuitable planning, accommodation for children and adults can be provided in an acceptable way on one site, with separate living accommodation and other facilities for each age-group..,   Long-stay accommodation for adults associated with general hospitals
c n-mmmialk   Bducation and worktffl Patients in any type of unit need facilities for education, sooial and worktraining and daily occupation.    Arrangements may be made for some patients toattend nearby day hospitals, local authority special schools, training centres orsheltered workshops or to go out to other employment.    For the rest, facilities areto be provided within the unit or at another hospital.Recreation2^ All patients need recreational facilities.    Those available to the general,or public/provided for the handicapped outside the hospital^are to be used whereverappropriate, but living rooms and play-rooms and space for outdoor recreations will alebe needed at every in-patient unit.Teaching hospitals2-52-        Regional Hospital Boards have been asked to consult the undergraduate teaching hospitals in their regions about the contribution these hospitals will make to the reorganised hospital services for the mentally handicapped. Although most under-graduate teaching hospitals now accept responsibility for services for a definedt      district, in addition to their wider teaching functions, their services will not be complete until they inolude the full range of hospital psychiatric services,including out-patient, day-patient and in-patient facilities for the mentally handicapped,,2 ?        Several teaching hospitals, in and outside London, are actively planning units for she mentally handicapped.     Some are beginning with assessment or treatmentunits for children, associated with their paediatric departments.lty       As well as improving the teaching hospital&apos;a service to its district, this isimportant for the training of the future generations of doctors who will work ingeneral practice or in hospital.    It should make them familiar with the problems of mental handicap as part of the wide spectrum of medicine.86
&apos;J-S%    In November 1970 the Government announced the allocation of  110m. additional resources for the years 1971-2 to 1974-5 for the health and personal social services inGreat Britain.     40m. of this will be available for hospital and local authority services for the mentally handicapped in England.   Including this  40m., about  100m.at 1970 prices is expected to be spent in these four years on improving hospital andlocal authority services for the mentally handicapped.that*2S^, On the hospital side, it is hoped/capital expenditure in these fourwill reach about  30m.years/    Revenue expenditure rose from about  48m. in 1969-70 to about  53m. in1970-71 and is expected to reach around  65m. by 1974-75 at 1970 prices.     Much of theincreased revenue will be spent on relieving intolerable conditions in the existinghospitals. q ^CONFIDENTIAL$55        Towards the end of 1969 the then Secretary of State for Social Servicescommissioned a study of buildings for the mentally handicapped by a team led byMr John Weeks.    This has been published and commended to hospital authorities.As well as new design ideas it contains helpful comments on the effect ofenvironment on the mentally handicapped, and suggestions for ways of adapting andre-furnishing old buildings to provide less impersonal and more stimulatingconditions.2^1        The Department of Health and Social Security has produced standard designsfor temporary buildings which can be erected quickly to relieve overcrowding by providing extra day-rooms or bedrooms, or for use as &quot;decanting wards&apos; whilepermanent buildings are being upgraded.    These as well as other methods areevaluated in the Weeks report.goj      More recently, in March 1971, the Department has issued general advice to hospital Boards on short-life building, the circumstances in which it may be preferred to permanent building and its limitations.FINANCE FOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMESFour-year programme
7 0   This increased revenue expenditure, together with a large proportion of thecapital expenditure,should   enable hospital authorities to achieve the five-year programme of improvements which started in 1970-71.     As far as possible Boardswill aim to relieve overcrowding by providing new units in centres of populationwhere they will contribute to the long-term reorganisation of services.     Somecapital must also be spent on adaptations to unsatisfactory buildings which may nothave a permanent place in the longer-term, The capitalavailable for these four years should also allow some    development of assessmentservices and other new buildings for the locally-based services of the future.    Itwill require careful judgment to get a proper balance between expenditure on buildings which are likely eventually to be abandoned but must be improved to relieve present intolerable conditions^and expenditure on existing or new buildings with a longer future use.Completing the programme. As local authority services increase and the numbers in hospital drop, during and after the first four years, the increased rate of revenue expenditure willprovide higher standards in the hospitals through higher expenditure per patient.In the long run annual expenditure at about the level expected in 1974-75 may besufficient if experience confirms the planning figures set out in Table 5.At a rough estimate some  120m. to  130m. in capital at 1970 prices may be needed for long-term reorganisation and interim improvements.    This estimate doesnot include the expenditure which may be needed to take account of increase in population and longer survival of the severely handicapped.2- y     Capital expenditure averaging about  7^m. a year would complete thehospital reorganisation programme within about the same period as the localauthority development programmes described in paragraphs   2o8Progress will necessarily vary from one area to another, and must become-ordinated with local authority development through joint plans as describedm paragraphs
JOINT PLANS BY HOSPITAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIESCo-ordination essentialJit Effective co-ordination of plans between hospital Boards (and the futurereorganised health authorities) and local authorities will be even more important in future than it has been in the past.      Some mentally handicapped children and adults should in future be able to live at home if the local authoritiesprovide social work support and other domiciliary services and the hospitalprovides (tay-patient facilities;   neither will be sufficient without the other.Our new planning assumes that a considerable number of children and adultswho are hospital in-patients will receive their education or work-training in schools or adult training centres provided by local authorities outside the hospitals.     When children are educated in hospital - whether in a hospitalschool or on the wards - their education will be provided by the local educationauthority and close co-operation between them and the hospital will be essential.2(/f Such joint use of services will only be possible if both the location andthe timing of hospital and local authority developments are co-ordinated byeffective joint planning.Alignment of areas26  In the past, efficient co-operation between hospitals and local authoritieshas been hindered by the widely different areas served by each.      This obstaclewill be greatly reduced by the reorganisation of local government and of theNational Health Service which will bring their areas of responsibility into line.^-67 Even before then progress can be made by reorganising services in sucha way that hospitals serve smaller and more local populations.     Small hospitalunits should fit easily into such a reorganisation.     It is more difficult withthe larger hospitals, some of which at present serve ten or more local authorityareas.      The possibility of &quot;sectorising&apos; these must be considered - that is to say89
designating particular wards or other units for patients from one sector of thehospital&apos;s total catchment area, each with their own team of staff who would alsobe responsible for out-patient and other services for the population of thatsectors    It is important that Regional Hospital Boards and Hospital management committees should work out such arrangements in consultation with the localauthorities as soon as possible.     The eventual aim should be to achieve catchmentareas for each hospital or part of a hospital which coincide with local authorityboundaries, or are wholly within one local authority area.Joint plansEach Regional Board has already been asked to prepare a development plan forits region and to consult the local authorities in doing so.     The publication ofthis Papery with the planning figures in Table 5 and the various recommendations for joint organisation of assessment and joint use of other services will make it possible - and essential - to produce for each areaco-ordinated plans to which both hospital and local authorities will work.0,6^      Preliminary discussions are already taking place between the Department and hospital Boards.     These should be followed later this year by detailed discussions between each Board and each of the local authorities in its region.Priorities within joint plansFIG The first target for the local authorities will be to develop their services for the mentally handicapped who are not already in hospital, to prevent futuremisplacements.     This will be the first priority, but must be accompanied by somemovement of patients from hospitals to local authority residential homes.     Otherdischarges from hospital should continue as at present, and as time goes on an increasing number of patients will be able to move to local authority homes.?-7v To prevent misplacements and to permit discharge it is not only residentialhomes which are required.    Adult training centres and social work support for the90
family may be equally relevant.     When an adolescent leaves a special school, the family may be able to keep him at home if a place in an adult training centre is available;   without it, it might be impossible for the family to manage andmisplacement in hospital might be the result.     It may be to discharge a hospital patient to live in lodgings if he can attend a sheltered workshop or adult training centre butnot otherwise.     Nevertheless, more residential homes are a prime necessity.     a balanced programme for each area is needed.1^1.        Each local authority should prepare its programme in the light of thediscussions with the hospital Board mentioned in paragraph .     The initial stages of each authority&apos;s programme should then be included in the new 10-yeardevelopment plans for the whole of their health and social services whichauthorities will be asked to draw up during 1972.     Preparation of thesedevelopment plans will require close and detailed collaboration with the hospital authorities.Local dates to end misplacements27.?      Tn drawing up this programme the aim should be to fix for each area as early a date as possible after which the hospitals will not be asked to admit anymore people9!
who need residential rather than hospital care.     Different dates may be fixed for children and for adults.     In some areas this date may be set within the period ofthe first 4-year programmej   in others it may have to be later.   The government propose to discuss with the local authority associations the fixing of a final date when this will apply throughout the country.Pace of development21 if   Paragraphs - 20?- 2-/and   732suggest that we must think in terms ofdevelopment programmes for local authority and hospital services lasting 15-20years over the c ountry as a whole.     The rate of progress will vary from one area to another.     Some local authorities and some hospital authorities are alreadynear the planning targets for some or all of the component parts of the services in such areas it may be possible to complete the services we want in about ten years,required../ others are less well advanced now and will need longer to complete.But for all areas agreed development plans should be preparedwithout delay, and implemented as resources permit.Testing of planning figures as time goes on, it will become clearer whether the planning figures inTable 5 are sound, or need adjustment.     It will also become possible to evaluatenew patterns of hospital services,with units of different sizes, in comparisonwith each other and with the best of the present larger hospitals.   The effects of population growth and of increased survival of the severely handicapped will need tobe allowed for, and also the possible effects of positive education and socialstimulation on the independence achieved by the present generation of mentally handicapped children.     Theories must be put to practical test, and changed ifexperience proves them wrong.Researcht1        Evaluation of new patterns of service as they develop is already included inour expanding programmes of research;   this must continue and increase.     Chapter 8summarises the past research which has had a profound influence on our presentthinking on services for the mentally handicapped, the scope for further research,and some of the subjects covered in our present programmes.
CHAPTER 7 &quot; VOLUNTARY SERVICE^THE CONTRIBUTION OP THE PRIVATE CITIZENPersonal interest&quot;)1        Private citizens, as individuals or through voluntar y organisations, canrnake a unique contribution to the welfare of the mentally handicapped and their families, over and above what even the best public services can provide.Neighbours and voluntary groups can offer.persuial interest and assistance whichis valued and valuable simply because it is voluntary - freely offered, not in thecourse of paid employment, but as a simple expression of personal concern between one human being and another,,^       This is immensely important in preserving - or re-establishing - the personalcontact with ordinary life without which the mentally handicapped living in hospital become institutionalised,,     For families with a mentally handicappedmember living at home, and for the staff of residential homes and hospitals, itmitigates isolation and loneliness;   it helps to keep them in active contact withtheir own local community;, which is beneficial both to them and to the handicappedpeople in their care0Parents groups 7 \     Parents of mentally handicapped children and adults, and other members ofsuch families, can make an especially valuable contribution.     They have a natural interest, and in many places have been the first to start voluntary workfor the mentally handicapped,,     They can help each other, and form groups to take an interest in the local hospital and local authority services.     Often theyform the nucleus of the hospital&apos;s League of Friends.     Similar groups can usefully act as &quot;Friends1 to residential homes and adult training centres.     their interest should be welcomed and encouraged by the hospitals and local authorities.93
All such activities by groups of private citizens have an added value intheir influence on local public opinion   and on attitudes towards the mentally handicapped.     They help to give the community at large a greater understanding ofwhat mental handicap means, the problems of families with a mentally handicappedmember, and how the local community can help.SUPPLEMENTING OFFICIAL SERVICES9jgi .     Voluntary organisations also can, and do, provide services similar to thosewhich the public authorities now aim to provide.     Indeed, voluntary bodies and individuals have been the pioneers in this field, as in so many other social services.     Over a period of at least a hundred years, individuals, local groups and national voluntary organisations interested in the mentally handicapped have seen unmet needs and led the way by starting to provide services and byinfluencing public opinion.25,1       The scope for such work is as great now as it has ever been.     voluntary organisations and private individuals are today providing residential homes forthe mentally handicapped, nursing homes, training centres and shelteredworkshops, and training courses and conferences for local authority hospital staff.They sponsor research and mould public opinion.     By constructive andrelentless criticism they goad Governments and local authorities to improve thestatutory services nationally and locally.     In addition, they contributegreatly to improving the quality of life of the people cared for by those authorities.GROWTH OF VOLUNTARY service%^        In recent years there has been a surge in the amount and diversity of voluntary help for the mentally handicapped in hospital and in the community.But much more is needed.     The activities described in this Chapter are onlyexamples of what is already done in some plaoes.     Similar activities would be welcomed elsewhere.     New volunteers will undoubtedly see new mwthods of helping.94
hospital&apos;s staff.     The appointment of a voluntary help organiser, as mentionedin paragraph . can improve the scope for co-operation.Group activities and services *2^        Activities for small groups of patients which can be organised and led byvolunteers include games of all sorts, drama, music, painting, modelling, andother hobbies, play groups, horse-riding - to name but a few.     voluntary organisations run library services and hospital shops and canteens.     A most valuable service is the organisation of transport to help relatives visit patients in hospitals which are not easy to get to.fjj^Q       . Groups of patients can also be given opportunities to join in activitiesoutside hospital.     Holiday camps can be organised, or day-trips, shoppingexpeditions, visits to cinemas, fun-fairs, football matches and other sports.And perhaps best of all, invitations to people1s own houses, singly or in small groups.friendship for individual patientsAt least a third of the 60,000 patients who now live in hospital are nevervisited.     Others have only occasional visits from relatives.     To befriend an individual patient is one of the most worthwhile forms of voluntary service.It is also one of the most difficult.     Many patients, particularly the moreseverely handicapped, have difficulty in communication.     Lack of an earlyresponse can be discouraging;   it takes time and patience to form a usefulrelationship.Funds for amenities212-    Fund-raising was one of the earliest forms of voluntary service, and isstill indispensible.     Funds have been raised for amenities for patients such asswimming pools, social centres, hairdressing salons, toys, aquariums,budgerigars and other pets, record players, and colour television.   contributions to Christmas festivities are welcome, and Christmas and birthday presents for patients.    Amenities for staff (such as a building for a staff club) have alsobeen provided, and are much needed especially in the older hospitals.
Service by young people^ .      Even as recently as ten years ago many would have thought twice aboutencouraging young people to visit hospitals for the mentally handicapped.Recently young people have come forward from schools, colleges and youth clubs,and as cadet members of the long-established voluntary organisations, and have proved that they are as well suited for voluntary service to the mentally handicapped as older people, both in hospitals and in the community.     Indeed,young people may find it easier than older people to establish rapport and get on easy terms with the handicapped.VOLUNTARY SERVICE FOR HOSPITALSLink with the communityS Voluntary services are indispensible for maintaining links between thegeneral community and hospital patients and staff.     This is particularly important for patients who stay in hospital for years - as many mentally handicapped patients do - and for staff of isolated hospitals many of whom live inthe hospital grounds and can become isolated and inward-looking.,k     N   Volunteers can come into the hospitals and contribute to their internallife.     They can take patients out locally, or for longer excursions or holidays.They can help relatives to visit, and can visit patients who have no interestedrelatives of their own.&quot;o hospital unit is too large or too small to need such help.     Whenhospital services are reorganised into smaller units, as foreshadowed in chapter 6, voluntary help in maintaining contacts with the surrounding communitywill still be essential.     A small hospital unit or residential home can be asisolated as a large one if it has no visitors.$        Voluntary service can be directed to groups of patients or to individuals,or to raising funds for amenities for patients generally or for staff.     Allthese are needed.     Voluntary work should be planned in consultation with the96
The hospitals most in need of help may be geographically isolated and difficult to reach by public transport.     The surrounding community may be small,so that the local volunteers are necessarily few, often belong to several organisa-tions and are heavily committedo     The large isolated hospitals serve very largepopulations;   with interest and ingenuity it should be possible to stimulatevoluntary services of one sort or another from many different parts of a large &apos;&apos;catchment area&apos;.     Leaders of local communities served by such hospitals couldencourage this, and it will become more meaningful when the large hospitals are organised in units each serving a particular area, as mentioned in paragraph 6.62.2^       Voluntary help is especially important for these hospitals, where manypatients are far from their homes and relatives, and staff are short.     They need more volunteers to organise outings and excursions, to help in educational and recreational activities, to visit patients.     Help at weekends and evenings isparticularly important, when teachers, instructors and therapists are off duty.New sources of voluntary helpQ*jy       The work of the established associations is being augmented by an increasingvariety of other groups.     School children raised money to buy roller skates for patients at one hospital, and went to the hospital every weekend to help thechildren to use them.     The &quot;regulars&apos; at a public house have adopted a ward.Local people without young children of their own befriend young patients, visitthem regularly and take them out.     Groups of students have spent some weeks oftheir vacations at various hospitals, helping in whatever ways the staff suggestand in new activities which they initiate.     There is almost unlimited scope for more help from more people.Voluntary help organisersThe employment by hospitals of paid voluntary help organisers, usually full-time, is an important new development.     Working alongside the voluntary97
organisations, their aim is to ensure that the contributions of the organisations and of individual volunteers are used to the best advantage.     Such appointmentshave generally been very successful in helping to increase the numbers of volunteers and extend the range of their activities.     As with most new developments there have been occasional difficulties;   and not unnaturally therehave been some doubts among those voluntary organisations already active in thefield.     This has shown how important it is that the right sort of person shouldbe chosen.     Advice is being issued to hospital authorities about the selection of people for this work and the qualities to be looked for.VOLUNTARY SERVICE IN THE COMMUNITYHelp for families and foster-parentsFamilies with a mentally handicapped member living at home need special help from their neighbours and local voluntary organisations.     The effects of ahandicapped member on the life of the family are mentioned briefly in Chapter 1.These immediately suggest practical ways in which neighbours can help.     the mother of a handicapped child or adult may also feel   a special need for the friendship of her neighbours, and without it be cut off from normal social contact..   . 1 Baby-sitting&apos; (whatever the age of the handicapped person) is not onlyinvaluable in giving the parents opportunities for a social life outside the home.It also brings fresh contacts for the handicapped person himself.     It is mosthelpful when organised on a regular basis.     Many other forms of help can be given -eg with shopping or transport and general good-neighbourliness.Social activities----- ^0.  &apos; The social activities mentioned in paragraph are just as important forhandicapped people living with their families, with foster-parents, in lodgingsor in a residential home as they are for those in hospital.     The brothers andsisters of a severely mentally handicapped child are often deprived of a normalhome life;   arrangements which give the rest of the family occasional relief fromlooking after   the handicapped member are extremely valuable.     Outings,
activities and holidays for the mentally handicapped therefore serve adoublepurpose, by enriching the life of the handicapped person and also helping theother members of the family.     Arranging holidays for the brothers and sisters is another useful voluntary service.^00 It may add to the interest of the occasion if a group of handicappedpeople taken on an outing can include some who do not normally live together -ega group including some from hospital, some from a residential home and some from private homes.     There is scope for infinite variety.     It is equally useful toarrange social activities for groups of handicapped people who do already knoweach other, eg through attending a training centre.3o1 Help is needed particularly during school Biolidays, when otherwise the mother may be tied at home and be unable to find time for such things as a visit tothe hairdresser.^302 Tbe adult training centre may provide a focal point for social and recreational activity.     Volunteers can work with the staff, contributing fromtheir personal skills or interests - photography or canoeing, for example.^qQj It is not right to think only in terms of activities specially for the mentally handicapped.     Many can take their place in groups who are not allhandicapped - for visits to cinemas, theatres and sports, or in play-groups,youth clubs and old people&apos;s clubs.Help for residential homes5^ Residents and staff in local authorities&apos; residential homes may need much the same sort of voluntary service as has been mentioned for hospitals -eg helpin organising hobbies, personal friends for residents not in touch with theirown families, funds for extra amenities.Needs of adultsVoluntary services should not overlook the needs of adults.     Children oftenget the most attention from voluntary sources.     Mentally handicapped adults need it just as much, and there are many more of them.99
!Just as hospitals may usefully appoint voluntary help organisers, so alsolocal authorities1 social service departments may need to give a lead inidentifying needs and suggesting to volunteers how their particular interests andskills can be most effective.     There is also scope for liaison with the hospitals to make the most constructive use of all local voluntary resources.Joint arrangements for voluntary service co-ordinators for hospital and localauthorities together should be considered.     But public authorities know thatthey should avoid over-organising.     The essence of voluntary service is that itis freely given, according to the talents and feelings of those who give it.
101CHAPTER 8.     RESEARCHRESEARCH FINDINGSop] Present attitudes towards the mentally handicapped and views on theservices they require are to a significant degree the direct result of research work in recent years.      This includes research into the nature andcauses of mental handicap;   the development of techniques for detecting andcorrecting secondary handicaps;   and studies which have demonstrated mentally handicapped people&apos;s considerable capacities for development and the effects of alternative methods of care.Prevention and detection 9$        The present, still limited, techniques of prevention and early detectionof mental handicap are described in Chapter 5 end the Appendix.      Many ofthese have been made possible by recent research into chromosomal aberrations,innate metabolic errors, and effects on the fetus of infectious diseases.Several kinds of abnormality in chromosomes have been found to be linkedregularly with mental handicap.3*^ Techniques have been developed fpr preventing the progression of physicaldeformities in mentally handicapped children who in the past would have been confined to a cot or chair.    Contractures can be prevented by early surgicaltreatment, by physiotherapy and by occupational therapy.3\0 .       Better understanding of child development, and techniques of developmentalscreening, have made it possible to identify deviant development much earlierand take corrective measures.1\\ Advances have been made recently in techniques for the detection ofvisual and auditory defects in people with mental handicap, even the mostseverely handicapped.
CONFIDENTIALApplication of educational techniquesEducational techniques have been successfully used, even with very severely mentally handicapped children, to develop verbal, and social skillsincluding self-care in such things as washing, dressing and feeding.These techniques include operant conditioning, and discrimination learning.Effect of social environmentIt has been demonstrated that an appropriately stimulating environmentleads to positive improvement in the abilities of mentally handicapped children.      Children living with their own families have been shown to bemuch less backward in social development than children of similar intelligencein institutional care.     Within hospitals children cared for in small groupsimproved significantly in speech and social behaviour compared with thosewho remained in large wards.     Even where children are living at home,attendance at a nursery school or class has been shown to help to provideenvironmental stimulation.j. Studies of children and adolescents have demonstrated that those whocome from poor and intellectually impoverished homes show a marked improvementin their assessed intelligence when placed in a more stimulating environment.Studies of residential homesA research study of local authority residential homes in one countyhas given some indication of the possibilities and limitations ofrehabilitation of institutionalised mentally handicapped patients.     It was hoped that these homes would be used for short-stay rehabilitation of patients discharged from hospital, to be followed by return to a moreindependent life.        This has proved possible only in a few cases, and someof the more severely handicapped have had to return to hospital.      Thosewho have been able to move from the homes to a less supervised environment102
CONFIDENTIAL(mainly their own family home) seem to have achieved a stable adjustment, butthe majority have been shown to require long-terra residential care.      Thistogether with successful admissions to the homes direct from the family hasdemonstrated the need for more local authority residential homes.Value of research findingsAll this has given us new knowledge of great value.     If put to good use,in this country and abroad, it will have a very substantial effect on futuregenerations, by some (still very limited) prevention of mental handicap and considerable reduction of the severity of its effects.      But there are stillmany important gaps in our knowledge, which we may hope will be filled throughfurther research.SCOPE FOR FURTHER RESEARCHThere are many branches of knowledge which are relevant to the problems of mental handicap.      These include many medical specialties, psychology,sociology and education.      Research in any or all of these fields may be helpful.Particular areas in which knowledge is far from complete include:   the causes of many types of mental handicap;   the genetic and metabolic factorsalready recognised as causes;   early detection of severe handicapping conditions the effects of severe psychiatric disorder in childhood;   methods of detectingthe less severe forms of mental handicap;   teaching and work-training;techniques for modifying behaviour problems in mentally handicapped adults;statistical information about the present numbers of mentally handicappedpeople and their characteristics, and the evaluation of such information;the effect of social environment;   the effects of different methods of providinghospital services.It will be important to evaluate the services described in Chapter 5 asthey develop, particularly those still at an early stage of development suchas parent counselling, and the new patterns of hospital services mentioned in chapters 5 and 6.confidential;

APPENDIX     - PREVENTION AND EARLY DETECTION1.     The advances in scientific knowledge and in methods of detection, which now make prevention of mental handicap possible in certain limited circumstances,are mostly quite recent.2.    Genetic counselling aims to explain to parents the risk of transmittingcertain types of hereditary diseases;   where there seems high risk of the birth of a handicapped child, parents can then seek help from the family planning service to prevent conception.     At present such counselling is only possible where one affected child is already born.     Developments in carrierdetection may make it possible in the future to identify some parents at riskbefore they have had an affected child.     Research is continuing into thedetection of chromosomal and biochemical abnormalities early in the antenatalperiod together with the offer of termination of pregnancy in appropriate cases.3.     The association between rubella infection in a pregnant woman andabnormalities, including occasionally mental handicap, in the fetus is well known.The recent development of a rubella vaccine now gives hope of prevention.k.     One of the most encouraging advances in recent years has been the discoveryof a way, by the use of anti-D-immunoglobulin, to prevent haemolytic disease ofthe newborn, a condition arising from rhesus factor incompatability between the blood of the mother and her child which can cause mental handicap.5.     Detailed surveillance throughout the ante-natal period, in the interestsof the child, has assumed greater importance, as more accurate methods areperfected for monitoring fetal growth and development.     This requiresco-operation between obstetricians and paediatricians, with the object of preventing or reducing the incidence of low-weight births which carry risk ofhandicap.6.     Expert care during labour enables birth asphyxia to be detected at an early stage and treated so as to prevent damage to the infant1s brain.CONFl4j4t$ial
7. Recent studies suggest that modern intensive care during the neonatal periodof low birth weight babies and others can prevent mental and physical handicap.8.     Since 1964 there have been arrangements for the notification of congenitalmalformations, including Down&apos;s syndrome (frequently called mongolism), which areapparent at birth.     Local health authorities keep under special review the care and progress of children notified under these arrangements.9.     Screening of all newborn infants for phenylketonuria, introduced within thelast 10 years, is now well established.     This allows the small number of children in whom this condition is detected to be given the special diet which may prevent or reduce the severe mental handicap which would otherwise result.10.   It is possible to detect some other defects in a young child and to giveearly treatment and training which modifies the severity of the eventual handicap.This requires a full medical examination, including a neurological examination,of every infant in the early weeks of life.     Such examinations are limited inpractice by shortage of paediatricians or other specially trained doctors, andin this situation they are concentrated on children known to be at risk.11.   The report on Child Welfare Centres published in 1967 recommended that local health authorities should maintain registers of children at risk of developinghandicapping conditions, for example where adverse factors occurred in the family history^ during a mother&apos;s pregnancy or at the child&apos;s birth.     the child&apos;s progress is then given special attention by the family doctor and thelocal authority&apos;s child health services, with a view to detecting any handicapat the earliest possible stage.12.   Developmental screening by observation of slow or deviant development isbeing increasingly practised in child health clinics and by family doctorsthroughout the country.107
108/ but still very limited13.   These developments represent a notable/advance in means of prevention and early detection.     But they are all comparatively recent and not yet fullyoperating.     Moreover, early detection is of little use unless followed byadequate dias;nosis and assessment, and by appropriate services for eachhandicapped child and its family.
Tuesday 6 April   1971PQ 1818/1970/71Han  Ref Vol */6Co 1 Jl33 -MENTALLY HANDICAPPED - WHITE PAPER*   17      Mrs Shirley Williams      (La. Hitchin)To ask the Secretary of State for Social  Services,  whenhe expects   to publish a White Paper on  the mentally handicapped;  and what  steps he  is  taking at present  toimprove overcrowding,  dietary levels,  and the provisionof personal  clothing  in hospitals for the mentally handicapped.SIR KEITH JOSEPHI have confirmed the  request made by my predecessor to regional Hospital Boards  to effect  in all hospitals forthe mentally handicapped a wide range of  improvementsincluding  those  referred to by the hon,Member.    Additionalmoney has been provided and guidance on these particularmatters has been issued or is under consideration.     Iexpect  to issue a general policy document within thenext  two  to three monthsMrs. Williams: 1 am grateful to ihcright lion. Gentleman tor that answer.I am sure that he appreciates the urgency of issuing a general policy document,since morale among the staff of hospitalsof this kind is of crucial importance.May we take it that he will bring for-ward that document at the earliest pos-sihlc moment?Sir K. Joseph : Yes, Sir.Mrs. Knij-iU : Will my right hon. Friendbear in mind also the problem of the mentally handicapped who are no1 in hospital and whose need is as great as,if not greater than, the need of those whohave the fortune to be in hospital&apos;.&apos;Sir K. Joseph : The Government have very much in mind the pressure on par-&quot;ents and relatives who are looking aftermentally handicapped persons at lumieand who are not yet receiving the full range of services to which, ideally, theyshould have access. This will be covered in the policy guidance/and it is ail partof the field for which we have providedextra money.Mr. Pavitt: Will the document whichthe right hon. Gentleman is to issue be substantially the same as that which he found on his desk when he took office?In view of the need for discussion on therestructuring of the Health, Service, onthe second consultative document which isdue to come out. will he make a stale-merit about how this is to be co-co-ordinated with the general provisions of the rest ofthe Health Service, apart from the mentally-ally handicapped?Sir K.&apos;Joseph: The principles of the document will be much the same as inthat which I found. With no disrespectto my predecessor, who initiated most valuable action in relation to the men-tally handicapped, I should say that thegreat difference will be that we have found exUa money, both for the localauthorities and for the hospital service,for help to the mentally handicapped.
