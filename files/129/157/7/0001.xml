INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATIONCONVENTION NO, 100 AND RECOMMENDATION NO. 90CONCERNING EQUAL REMUNERATION FOR MENAND WOMEN WORKERS FOR WORK OF EQUAL VALUEMemorandum by the Secfc^eSaffy of State for employment the fbeing of a definite date for the introduction of equal pay in both Great Britain and Northern Ireland makes possible the ratification of ILO Convention No. 100 and the acceptance of Recommendation No. 90.It has been confirmed that there has been full compliance with thespecial obligation to ensure the application of equal pay in employmentunder Government control.    We do not expect, however, that ratification of the Convention will have repercussions en the rate at which equal pay is introduced within the United Kingdom, the governing factor being the domestic legislation.    Ratification will, fulfil a pledge made under theprevious administration.2.      Parliament was informed by White Paper in 1952 that a decisionon ratification of the Convention was being deferred, and it is therefore thought that the decision to ratify now should also be announced in a white Paper.3.     I now enclose a draft White Paper announcing the decision.    this draft has been prepared in full consultation between my Department andthe others concerned.    If my colleagues agree, I propose to publish the enclosed draft as soon as possible, and I should also 10se to be able to announce the decision at the annual International Labour Conference in geneva in. June after the White Paper has laid before Parliament for thestatutory 21 days.    I do not expect the document to be in any waycontroversial,    I shculd therefore be grateful for any comments not later than Monday, 10 May.R department of Employment SW14 May 1971CP(71) 57 COPY NO     gg4 May 1971CABINET
CONFIDENTIALDRAFT WHITE PAPER annex the decisions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in 1953 on the conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International LabourConference at its 3^th Session in 1951 were  set out in a white paper (Cmd 8786)  presented to Parliament in March 1953*    Thedecisions then announced in respect of Convention No 100 and recommendation No 90,  both concerning Equal Remuneration for Menand Women Workers for Work of Equal Value, were as follows:-CONVENTION NO 100 and RECOMMENDATION NO 90The Convention lays down certain general principles inregard to equal remuneration for men and women workers for workof equal value,  which is defined as referring to  &quot;rates of remuneration established without discrimination based on sex&quot;.The central provisions of the Convention are contained inArticle 2, which provides that each member shall,  by meansappropriate to the methods in operation for determining ratesof remuneration,  promote and,  in so far as is consistent withsuch methods,   ensure the application to all workers of theprinciple of equal remuneration for men and women workers forwork of equal value.    This Article also sets out the variousmeans by which the principle may be applied.    Other Articlesof the Convention provide that, where such action would assist in giving effect to the provisions of the Convention, measuresshall be taken to promote objective appraisal of jobs on thebasis of the work to be performed,  and that there  shall become-operation,   as appropriate,  between Governments and Employersand Workers&apos;  organisations concerned for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the Convention.The Recommendation sets out procedures for the progressiveapplication of the general principles laid down in theConvention.    It is provided in the preamble to theRecommendation that these measures should be applied subject tothe provisions of Article 2 of the Convention.Her Majesty&apos;s Government have accepted the general principle of equal pay in relation to their own employees,  andintend to give effect to it as soon as the economic andfinancial circumstances of the country make it possible to doso.    The wider obligations envisaged in the Convention and recommendation will require careful consideration, but untilconditions are such as to enable Her Majesty&apos;s Government toproceed with the introduction of equal pay in the government service it is necessary to defer a decision with regard tothese instruments.The passage of the Equal Pay Act 1970 and of the Equal Pay Act(Northern Ireland) 1970 enable the United Kingdom to satisfy therequirements of the Convention and the Government now propose to ratify it and to accept the Recommendation.The texts of the Instruments are set out in the annex to this paper.CONFIDENTIAL

INTERNATIONAL LABOUR conference recommendation (No. 90) CONCERNING equal remuneration FOR MEN AND WOMEN workers for WORK OF EQUAL VALUEThe General Conference of the International LabourOrganisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Bodyof the International Labour Office, and having met inits Thirty-fourth Session on 6 June 1951, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals withregard to the principle of equal remuneration for menand women workers for work of equal value, which isthe seventh item on the agenda of the session, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take theform of a Recommendation supplementing the equal remuneration Convention, 1951,adopts this twenty-ninth clay of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and fifty-one the following Recommendation,which may be cited as the Equal Remuneration Recommenda-tion, 1951 :Whereas the Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951, lays down certain general principles concerning equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value ;Whereas the Convention provides that the application ofthe principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value shall be promoted or ensured by meansappropriate to the methods in operation for determining ratesof remuneration in the countries concerned ;Whereas it is desirable to indicate certain procedures forthe progressive application of the principles laid down in theConvention ;Whereas it is at the same time desirable that all members should, in applying these principles, have regard to methods of application which have been found satisfactory in certain countries;The Conference recommends that each Member should,subject to the provisions of Article 2 of the Convention, apply the following provisions and report to the International LabourOffice as requested by the Governing Body concerning themeasures taken to give effect thereto :1. Appropriate action should be taken, after consultationwith the workers&apos; organisations concerned or, where suchorganisations do not exist, with the workers concerned 
(a) to ensure the application of the principle of equal remu-neration for men and women workers for work of equal value to all employees of central Government departments or agencies; and(b) to encourage the application of the principle to employees of State, provincial or local Government departments oragencies, where these have jurisdiction over rates of remuneration.2. Appropriate action should be taken, after consultationwith the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations concerned, toensure, as rapidly as practicable, the application of the principleof equal remuneration for men and women workers for workof equal value in all occupations, other than those mentionedin Paragraph 1, in which rates of remuneration are subject to statutory regulation or public control, particularly as regards (a) the establishment of minimum or other wage rates in industries and services where such rates are determined under public authority;(b) industries and undertakings operated under public owner-ship or control; and(c) where appropriate, work executed under the terms ofpublic contracts.3. (1) Where appropriate in the light of the methods inoperation for the determination of rates of remuneration, pro-vision should be made by legal enactment for the general application of the principle of equal remuneration for men andwomen workers for work of equal value.(2) The competent public authority should take all neces-sary and appropriate measures to ensure that employers and workers are fully informed as to such legal requirements and,where appropriate, advised on their application.4. When, after consultation with the organisations ofworkers and employers concerned, where such exist, it is notdeemed feasible to implement immediately the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value, in respect of employment covered by Paragraph 1, 2 or 3,appropriate provision should be made or caused to be made, assoon as possible, for its progressive application, by such measures as (a) decreasing the differentials between rates of remuneration for men and rates of remuneration for women for work of equal value;(b) where a system of increments is in force, providing equalincrements for men and women workers performing workof equal value.5. Where appropriate for the purpose of facilitating the determination of rates or remuneration in accordance with theprinciple of equal remuneration for men and women workers
for work of equal value, each Member should, in agreement withthe employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations concerned, establishor encourage the establishment of methods for objectiveappraisal of the work to be performed, whether by job analysisor by other procedures, with a view to providing a classification of jobs without regard to sex; such methods should be applied inaccordance with the provisions of Article 2 of the Convention.6. In order to facilitate the application of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value, appropriate action should be taken, where necessary,to raise the productive efficiency of women workers by such measures as (a) ensuring that workers of both sexes have equal or equiva-lent facilities for vocational guidance or employementcounselling, for vocational training and for placement;(b) taking appropriate measures to encourage women to usefacilities for vocational guidance or employment counsel-ling, for vocational training and for placement;(c) providing welfare and social services which meet the needsof women workers, particularly those with family respon-sibilities, and financing such services from general public funds or from social security or industrial welfare fundsfinanced by payments made in respect of workers without regard to sex ; and(d) promoting equality of men and women workers as regardsaccess to occupations and posts without prejudice to theprovisions of international regulations and of national laws and regulations concerning the protection of the health and welfare of women.7. Every effort should be made to promote public under-standing of the grounds on which it is considered that theprinciple of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value should be implemented.8. Such investigations as may be desirable to promote theapplication of the principle should be undertaken.
