CONFIDENTIAL

Mr Harold Atcherley (Chairman, also on TSRB)

Admiral Sir Desmond Dreyer

Mr J E Mortimer

Mr Ewen McEwen

Mr Cyril Roberts

Mr Gerard Young (also on TSRB)

This Body could operate at once, and could begin work informally before an announcement was made.

DOCTORS&apos; AND DENTISTS&apos; REVIEW BODY (DDRB)

6. There has been difficulty in finding a suitable and willing Chairman, but Lord Halsbury has now accepted. He has approved the suggested members, and the following people are being approached urgently -

Mr Peter Menzies (also on TSRB)

Professor R C O Matthews (also on AFRB)

Professor R H Graveson

Mr Ian Macdonald

Professor Peter Moore

Lord Caldecote

SECRETARIAT

7. The Office of Manpower Economics is already in operation, and the staff provide continuity with the National Board for Prices and Incomes which is particularly relevant to the Armed Forces (including senior officers) and nationalised boards. They are in a position to service the new bodies as soon as they are set up.

TIMING

8. We were in a position to announce the Chairman of the AFRB and several members of both the TSRB and the AFRB when Lord Boyle&apos;s appointment was announced on 8 April. It was decided that it was preferable to avoid highlighting the absence at that time of a DDRB Chairman and the incomplete membership of all bodies. We may expect in a few days to be in a position to announce the Chairmanship of the AFRB and the DDRB, and something very close to the full membership of all three bodies.
