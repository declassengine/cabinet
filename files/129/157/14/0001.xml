GAS AND ELECTRICITY prices memorandum by the Secretary of State for trade and industry at their meeting on 20 May the Economic Policy Committee asked me to bring the question of gas and electricity prices before Cabinet.THE proposals.    a. Gas Tariff increases effective from 1 July averaging about?2 per cent raising  28 million in 1971-72 and  44 million inthe first full year,b. Ehs^tricity.    A surcharge from 1 August averaging about10 per cent on all tariffs which are not automatically adjusted for changes in fuel costs, raising about  60 million in 1971=72 and 100 million in a full year&quot;.    (The South Wales board is planning a wider tariff revision at about the same general leveL&quot;)   this might be followed by a full tariff revision early next &quot;year.    TheCouncil have sought my views on the level of return at which theyshould aim,GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS3. These proposals follow quickly after the increases implementedearlier this year mainly because of the very rapid rise in costs whichhas faced British industry as a whole.    They are highly unwelcome in thepresent inflationary situation and they could be used as arguments for increases in other prices and in wages.    But unless we are prepared to seethe nationalised industries drift into continued deficit financing which wouldbe contrary to our general policy and eventually create a situation wherethere would either have to be a capital write off or very large price increases indeed, our policy must be to set them realistic financial objec^tires and accept prices ptoperly related to costs.    This is necessary tos-a. Hold the boards sharply to account for efficient performance.b. Secure soundly based investment programmes - a continuation of domestic electricity prices at their present level of around20 per cent below costs would stimulate uneconomic demandrequiring additional investment estimated by the electricity council at  600 million over five years.1CP(71) 64 COPY NO     gQ24 May 1971CABINET
c.      Limit the demand made by the industries on the National Loei&amp;sFund.    Rejection of the present proposals would directly reducecash flow and increase borrowings by about  150 million in afull year.COSTS4. The proposals include some anticipation of wage and other costs.It can be argued that this will weaken resistance to wage demands.    Butcost increases are going on all the fcime0    Unless we are prepared toaccept a degree of anticipation we face the damaging prospect of frequentincreases in nationalised industry prices and continuing insufficient profits.Our ability to hold back inflationary wage settlements in the natioeaalisedindustries depends not on restricting prices but on the co-operation of the chairmen and boards.    This could be prejudiced if we act on prices in away they regard as unreasonable,    I would, however, make it quite clear to the industries that in the public presentation of the price proposals theymust avoid any reference to anticipation of wage increases and rest their case on the need to relate prices to cost and to reduce demands on the NLF,FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES5. The objectives for the gas and electricity industries for the fiveyears 1969-70 to 1973-74 are to earn a return of 7.&quot;4 per cent and 7 per cent respectively on net assets.    The gas tariff proposals are designed to reachthis objective.    The electricity industry had at the beginning of 1971-72 acumulative shortfall cn its objective of  165 million.    The surcharge willmerely stop it from growing.    To&quot;make good the&quot; shortfall by the end of the quinquennium would mean a full tariff revision&quot; early next year totalling about  180 million a year (including the surcharge) and putting prices aboveeconomic costs.    Sir Norman Elliott would like the objective to be to breakeven in 1971-72 and earn 7 per cent on &quot;net assets for 1972-73.    This would possibly avoid a tariff increase next year but would keep prices below -economic eostsa    To bring prices in line with costs I propose an objective of 7 per cent from April 1971 to March 1974.    This would require tariffincreases raising about  140 million a year inclusive of the surcharge.conclusion,        A major reduction in the proposals of the Gas and ElectricityCouncils would be very damaging.    A minor change would not alter theirbroad economic and political impact.    Accordingly I ask my colleagues toagree that I should tell;-a. the Gas Council that we raise no objections to the putting of theproposed increase in tariffs to the consultative councils;b, the Electricity Council thatj-L    we raise no objections to the putting to the consultative councils of the proposed surcharge and the South Wales tariff revision;ii,    the industry should plan tariffs on the basis of earning a return of 7 per cent on net assets from April 1971 to March 1974.J d department of Trade and Industry, SW124 May 1971
GAS prices the tariff increases made by Gas Boards last January took only limitedaccount of future inflation and did not allow for the substantial wage increaseearly this year.    In the event the industry&apos;s costs have already risen sharply,and it is evident that the allowances made for cost movements were inadequate.2      The settlement with manual workers (effective from January), and that under negotiation with salaried staff, are expected to add another  3^ million to net costs over the quinquennium.   Oil feedstocks (including the effects ofthe recent settlement with the oil producing countries) will add another 3^ million, and other known increases  13 million.   To be set against theseare savings and other credits of  41 million.   This figure is additional tothe substantial cost reductions which the industry expects to achieve up to march 197^, largely as a result of the introduction of natural gas, and whichwere included in the previous forecasts; and additional also to the savings from the additional productivity expected from the recent v/age settlement,which have been taken into account by showing the cost of that settlement net.Without a further tariff increase known additional cost increases will takethe industry into deficit, both in 1971/2 and over the quinquennium as awhole.   With realistic allowances for future inflation of  37 million, theestimated deficit over the quinquennium would exceed  50 million.   The figures are summarised in the appendix.3      The industry proposes to introduce on 1 July tariff increases averaging7.7% for domestic consumers and 7 .h% for all tariff customers, to bring in anadditional  118 million over the quinquennium.   The proposed tariff increases are fairly evenly spread among different classes of customers.    They do notbear particularly hardly on small consumers.    They would bring in  28 million this year and &amp;kk million in the first full year.
k       Increases in costs such as the current wage settlements and the increases in oil prices should be quickly reflected in gas prices, and there is a strong case for making realistic provision for inflation.    It would of course be unwise to use anticipated wage increases in 1972/73 as public justification for the tariff increases, but attention could usefully be drawn to theGovernment&apos;s known wish to encourage nationalised industries to improve theircash flow; and reduce their dependence on the National loans Fund.5       Very large sums of public money have been invested in the gas industryto enable it to distribute and sell North Sea gas, which is a wasting asset.If that capital is to be recovered and a reasonable return is to be earned on it, the industry must not be denied the opportunity to earn a rising rate of return over the next years, which should be the operation&apos;s period of maximumprofitability.
ELECTRICITY prices       The tariff increases made by Electricity Boards between January and april 1971 took only limited account of future inflation.   The reductions whichwe persuaded the boards to accept inevitably prevented them from making goodany of their shortfall on their financial objectives.   The modified increases were expected to be sufficient to provide a 7 per cent return in the year1971/72.2      The industry&apos;s estimates of cost have now risen and its estimates ofvolume of sales have been reduced.   The net result is to show a deterioration in the estimated profit for 1971/72 from  92m to a loss of  5m.3      The estimate for 1971/72 of fuel costs has risen by  75m including theeffect of the recent UK coal price increase, of a smaller improvement inthermal efficiency, of various oil price adjustments and of the need to importmore costly coal.   But the estimate of costs of other goods and services hasbeen increased by  24m, and of interest changes by  ^m.   Lower estimates of sales have reduced net revenue by  22m.   Recovery of increased fuel costs fromthe larger consumers whose tariffs contain fuel cost adjustment clauses isexpected to realise  30m.k      The industry estimates that the loss will increase to  30m in 1972/73 ifprices are not raised and after making allowance for general inflationcontinuing at a rate of 7i per cent in 1971/72 and of 5 per cent in 1972/73.5      The shortfall on the financial objective for the five years from 1 April1969 had reached  I65 million by the end of the first two years.   It is likelyto reach  200m before any additional revenue can be raised.6      The. Electricity Council estimates that domestic tariffs are now on average 20 per cent below cost.   The burden of any increase should thereforefall mainly on domestic consumers, particularly since fuel cost increases arepassed on automatically to the larger mainly industrial consumers.
7      The industry considers that full recovery of the shortfall of the objective is virtually impossible and has asked for guidance on the standardof financial performance which the boards should assume in framing proposalsfor tariff increases.8      Because of the rapidly deteriorating financial position and because it takes time to negotiate detailed tariff revisions with the area consultativecouncils, the industry proposes the introduction of flat rates surcharges assoon as possible on all tariffs not subject to fuel cost adjustment.9      The surcharges would generally be in a range of 0.C4 to 0.10p/unit(between 5 per cent and 13 per cent).   Increases in off-peak tariffs wouldbe smaller (although greater in percentage terms).   The South Wales board which did not increase tariffs earlier this year is planning a wider tariffrevision which with minor exceptions will be within the same range.   The full year yield would be about  100m.    For 1971/7?-, assuming introduction from1 August, the yield would be  6*0m.10     To meet the five year objective in full would mean increasing tariffsby about 1&amp;% (about  l80m in a full year) and would put prices above future economic costs.   But the industry should be required to meet their objective of a 7% returns for the last three years.   To achieve this would require a return of about 8 per cent in the last two years and bring tariffs broadlyin line with economic costs.   On present estimates this implies a tariffincrease yielding about  l^fOm a year including the surcharge.
