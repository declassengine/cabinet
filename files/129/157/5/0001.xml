CP(&apos;?^ 55 COPY NO        g Q26 April, 1971CABINETGRADUATED PRESCRIPTION charges memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Servicesle At their meeting on 22 April the Cabinet invited me to report theposition on graduated prescription charges (CM(71) 21st Conclusions,Minute 7),2. The relevant passage in the White Paper &quot;New Policies for public spending&quot; was as follows;&quot;Measures will be introduced as soon as possible to enableprescription charges to be related more closely than now toa proportion of the cost of the individual prescription, witha ceiling to the amount of the charge.    Meanwhile, the existingflat rate charge of 2s 6d per prescription item will be raised to4s, the arrangement for exemption remaining unchanged&quot;.3,        Regulations increasing the flat rate charge from 12^p to 20p havebeen made and came into effect on 1 April.4. Before charges can be cost related the charging provisions in theNational Health Service Acts must be amended and the Social services committee has approved proposals for this.    The legislation coverscharging powers generally and would enable the Health Ministers tomake regulations, subject to affirmative resolution, varying both themethods of assessing the charges for drugs and appliances, glassesand dental appliances and treatment^, and also the categories of personsentitled to the remission or refund of optical and dental charges.5. I have in mind that the charge payable should represent in eachcase about 50 per cent of the total cost of the prescription, with a minimumcharge of 20p - the present flat-rate charge - and a maximum of 50p4    Thecharge payable would move in steps of 5p.    Chemists and dispensing doctorswould have a table and a list from which they would be able to ascertain thecharge payable.    The present very wide exemption arrangements would continue unchanged; and prepayment certificates, on favourable terms,would be available for people who needed frequent prescriptions but were1
not otherwise exempt,,    I estimate that, on this basis, the additional netyield in the first full year would be about  15 million (Great Britain),,6. These proposals have been put by my officials to the organisationsrepresenting doctors and chemists.    Their first reaction has been hostile:both oppose cost-related charges in principle, the doctors on clinicalgrounds.    The chemists also argue that the practical difficulties are such that they are not prepared to undertake the task,70        I intend to meet the professions to try to persuade them to change their minds.    The chemists can be reminded that extra remuneration willbe due to them for the extra work involved; but in my view it will almost certainly be necessary to offej? some specific concession.    It might perhapshelp if I told them thati in deference to their views, I should be prepared toreduce the proposed maximum charge from 50p to 40p,    This would involvea loss of revenue of about  3 million a year.    I should deplore such a lossjbut I think we should be prepared to face it if by this means we could secure acceptance of the principle of cost-related charges.    The possibility ofmaking this concession has just been put to the Treasury.8,        If the professions are not open to persuasion I do not think that inpractice graduated charges could be imposed.    The scheme needs theprofessions1 co-operation; and public opinion would be against us.Moreover the pharmaceutical industry might use the occasion forwithdrawing from the voluntary price regulation scheme: if this happened,it would seriously worsen an already difficult situation,9. We expected opposition of the nature, but not quite of the ferocity,that v/e have encountered.    I still think that a move to cost-relatedprescription charges would be an important gain and that v/e shouldmake it if at all possible.    The administrative objections could bemet by changing to the Swedish system of prepaid, prepackaged drugsbut this would be a big change, the financial implications of which have still to be assessed, and would in any event take several years to bringabout.    Additional revenue from cost-related charges had been assumed in this year&apos;s public expenditure budget: the only alternative way of raising the necessary money would be to increase the flat rate chargeagain,, to 30p, a total increase of 140 per cent over the charge under theprevious Administration,10.       I suggest that I should make a further report to the Cabinet afterseeing the doctors and the chemists.    Whatever the outcome, we shall need new charging legislation, if only to implement the decision announced in Cmnd 4515 to reduce the upper age limit of exemption from dentaltreatment charges from 21 to 18 and to exempt recipients of supplementary benefit and Family Income Supplement from optical and dental charges.The timing will however turn on the ultimate decision as to cost-relatedprescription charges,K department of Health and Social Security SE126 April 1971
