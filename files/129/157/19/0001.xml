CP(71) 69 COPY NO21 June 1971CABINET1971 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REVIEW:HEALTH AND PERSONAL SOCIAL services memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. In my paper to Cabinet last September (CP(70) 54) I said that to fulfil our Election promises we needed additional expenditure on the health and personal social services in England alone of  34 million in 1971-72rising to over  200 million in 1974-75.2.        As a result the English programme was increased by  17 million for 1971-72 and i.25j million for each of the next three years.    Against a background of new charges and the abolition of cheap welfare milk, togetherexpected to save  70 million in a full year.3. I was of course very pleased to obtain this extra provision but it represented only a small part of what I asked for and cannot make any reallysignificant inroads into the urgent problems facing us.    I made it clear atthe time that I should be asking for further increases during this yearTspublic expenditure review,4. I now feel bound to seek further provision because I am more than ever convinced that the assessments I made last year were not in any wayexaggerated.    Public attention is constantly being f ocussed on the deficiencies in the services: an example being the recent report by theHospital Advisory Service.5. There is another reason why we should act now,    I believe that atthe end of our present term of office we must be able to point to substantial and quantifiable achievements in the social services, because that is thearea in which our opponents allege they have the monopoly for understanding and Tcaring*.   For not very large amounts of money we could demonstrateprogress towards improving the badly neglected areas of the health and personal social services.    What we need are some easily identifiableprogrammes which we can express in measurable terms.    They need not becompleted within our term of office but we should have mapped them out,provided for their cost and made recognisable progress towards the objectives.1
6, It will be possible to announce programmes of this kind only if more money is made available.    The rise in the population, advances in medicalknowledge, and the increased expectations of the public all contribute to aninescapable need to expand and improve services over a wide front.    Thepresent allocations will be quite inadequate for this purpose, and unless they are augmented we shall appear to be losing ground instead of making progress.7.        At the same time I recognise that there are now greater pressures on the economy and I have therefore sought to reduce my proposed additions to a bare minimum, even though that will mean leaving large areas of needunmet.    This year*s Public Expenditure Survey Committee report will show the following allocation:1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 2087 m  2174 m  2250 m  2331 for the reasons set out in the appendix, I consider that the minimumadditions which need to be made to these totals ares1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 25 m  56 m  86 m  100 mAll these figures relate to England only.    The Secretaries of State forScotland and Wales will no doubt say whether they would want their ownprogrammes to be similarly increased.8.        I should like to make some contribution to meeting the extra expenditure and I have reviewed ideas such as a hospital boarding charge and collecting more money towards the cost of treating road accidentcasualties.    None of these seems to me to be a starter but there are two possibilities which, although falling within the responsibility of theChancellor of the Exchequer, I should like to be considered.9.        The first is to transfer from the National Insurance Fund to theNational Health Service (NHS) the savings which the Fund makes at present when sickness and other benefits are abated after a patient has been in hospital for 8 weeks.    This transfer from the Fund would have to be balanced by an increase in National Insurance contributions at the upratingin 1973 equivalent to about lp a side.    If the extra sum raised in contributions were made available to the health and personal social services,it would amount to about  20 million a year.10.       The second is to increase the NHS contribution.    I know that the contribution can be classed as a form of taxation.    But the public at largeapprove of the NHSj and I think that most pay contributions which they knowwill be used only for the Service more willingly than they pay general taxes.Certainly past increases in the NHS contribution have not evoked any seriousoutcry.    I suggest we should consider meeting part of the additional expenditure I have proposed by increasing the NHS contribution.   Againeach extra lp on both the employees and the employeeTs contribution would produce about  20 million a year.2
11.        As I have said, I think we have to rule out the possibility of any new form of charge to users of the service.    Once I have kept my commitment to increase revenue from prescription charges by means of either a graduated charge or some other scheme that ensures a buoyant income -I shall be submitting a separate paper on the subject - I think we should announce that we have no intention of introducing any new forms of chargein the lifetime of the present Parliament.K department of Health and Social Security SE118 June 19713
APPENDIX TO MEMORANDUM BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICESgeneral1,    As I said in my memorandum, my proposals for specific additional expenditure on the health and personal social services are intended to relate to readily identifiable programmes which we can point to and forwhich we can claim special credit.   The normal development of the servicesover a broad front must continue at the same time and none of these special programmes can. be expected to be financed from within presentallocations.   Indeed, as will be been from paras 3 and if, more money isalso needed for the 1 normal&apos; hospital building programme and for temporaryexpenditure resulting from the reorganisation of the National health service.2.     To illustrate that the present allocations will be under severe strain I list some of the developments which can be foreseen in the next few years -a. Evidence of the inadequacy of existing services is continuallyaccumulating.   For example, Grovemment Social Surveys have recentlyshown that the present home-help service needs to be at least doubledin size (at an additional cost of about  25 million a year) and that many of the handicapped without help from their families are notreceiving the help they need from elsewhere.b. The number of people over 65 in the community is growing at the rateof 80,000 a year.   The provision of necessary services for these people will absorb a large part of the increase in expenditure atpresent planned even if no allowance is made for overdue improvementin standards.c. Local authorities have substantial additional commitments resultingfrom the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968, the Children&apos;sand Young Persons Act 1969, the Local Authority Social Services Act1970 and the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970.   It isnow estimated that there are no fewer than 600,000 severely handicappedout of 1^ million handicapped people in England living at home who require help of one kind or another;   the size of the problem was notappreciated until recently and my colleagues will not need to be reminded that these people have a growing lobby of support.   There ismoreover an increasing need for services for the very young, and we3hall expect the local authorities to build more health centres andexpand their family planning services.d. Our White Paper on Mental Handicap will show that substantial portions of the normal hospital allocations will need to go to the mentally handicapped even if we no more than maintain what must be regarded asan unsatisfactory *lv* &amp;fof$gNfflg *-
e. We need increased expenditure on postgraduate medical education and on other forms of training, particularly training in senior management.Considerable expansion is necessary in the training arrangements for fieldsocial workers, for the staff of residential institutions,... and for teachers of the adult handicapped.    We must improve the career structurefor hospital doctors in order to check emigration and shall be makingadditional efforts to attract back into service married women doctors.Hospitals will need to implement 4report on the organisation of theirmedical work and will have to find money to introduce the new G-NCnurse-training syllabus.  ^They will need to employ a whole range of newtechnicians to operate modem equipment. &amp;f. We must reduce hospital waiting-lists and thus make it possible for patients to return more quickly to useful lives in the community.     Wemust develop rehabilitation, and services for such groups as the deafand epileptics.     Hospitals need to spend more money on work study,particularly to get more incentive bonus schemes for manual staff intooperation.     More should be spent on building and engineering maintenanceas recommended by the Woodbine Parish Report.     Other measures whichshould ultimately bring savings will also need pump-priming expenditurein the next five years.Hospital Building programme.    Since the hospital building programme started in the early 1960s ithas been growing at a broad overall rate of between 8 and 9 per cent eachyear in real terms.     This rate of growth has to be continued during theperiod covered by the present Public Expenditure Survey if we are to makeinroads into the obsolescence of our hospitals, keep pace with developments in medical knowledge and escape criticism for losing the momentum which all parties have welcomed.     The present capital allocations for hospital buildingsshow a virtual flattening out of the programme from 1972/73 onwards.     Wesought  to mask this in our first White Paper on Public Expenditure by notitemising the capital figures for 1973/74 and 1974-/75 and by saying thatdetailed allocations had not yet been made for these years. We shall not be ableto hide the flattening out on the next occasion. In any case, it is essentialthat growth should continue. I therefore consider that the England figures forthe normal building programme - quite apart from the special programmes I men-tion below - should be increased by the following sums so as broadly to pre-serve the rate of advance inherent in the expenditure up to 1972/73 -  million (England)J97V7fc 1974/75 1 ?75/7612 26 36
Reorganisation of the National Health Servicek.   Although the reorganisation of the National Health Service should producebetter value for money in the long run - indeed this is one of its main objects -there will inevitably be some temporary additional expenditure both before and immediately after the appointed day (l April 197*0.      The reasons for this are:a. We shall need to set up &quot;shadow&quot; authorities about a year beforethe appointed day while the exiting authorities are still functioning,and there will be other inescapable administrative costs arising fromthe change to the new system.b. There will have to be a great deal of special training for senior staffso as to convert them from thinking solely at a hospital or a community service level to thinking in terms of an integrated structure.c. The proposed Staff Commission will give rise to expenditure; and therewill be compensation for any staff made redundant or downgraded.5.   These extra expenses are difficult to quantify but the best estimate that can be made at present shows that we cannot escape the following additional costs -  million (England)1972/73 1973/7^ 197V75 1975/760.5 3.5 6.5 5.0This temporary additional expenditure will continue to decline after 1975/76as the increased staffing and other costs associated with the change to the new system come to an end or are offset by savings from the reduction in the numberof administering authorities.Specific programmes Elderly6.   Between 1971 and 198l the numbers of the population over 65 will increase by over 13 per cent and those over 75 by nearly 20 per cent.      There will be a need to direct more and more of the nation&apos;s resources to their care.    A radical shiftin the pattern of care is required with an emphasis on proper assessment, activetreatment and rehabilitation and away from custodial care in large institutions.This will call for substantial capital expenditure to replace present quiteunsuitable accommodation, much of it dating from the last century and oftenalready a disgrace to our society.      Quite apart from this replacement problem and making good the existing deficiencies, the capital cost of providing necessary5
hospital accommodation for the extra numbers of the elderly will alone amount tosome  6 million a year.   Considerable development of all kinds of domiciliaryhelp and care for the elderly is also needed and will, indeed, be essential ifthe hospital programme is not to be still further expanded.   We have broughtSection 45 of the Health Services and PuMic Health Act 1966 into operation from1 April to enable local authorities to undertake this development, and they andwe will be under pressure to see that the expectations are fulfilled.7.     The present allocations will go some way to meet the need for additionallocal authority accommodation and services, but although part of the money i3planned to be devoted to replacing accommodation local authorities are stilltoday providing 15,000 residential places in foimer workhouses (dating from thelast century or even earlier) which it will take them 10 years to replace at thepresent rate of progress.   This is an area where we can make an impact with awell-publicised programme and I propose that we should announce our firm intentionto get rid of all these workhouses within the next 5 years.   This will need anadditional  23 million of capital expenditure which could be spread over thePESC period as follows, leaving a further  7 million to be found in 1976/77.  million12Z2/J3.im/Jk1974/751?75/761566CO NFIDF KITIAI
8.      Local authorities also provide about 30,000 places for old people inadapted large houses, many of which are quite as bad as the workhouses.Replacement will cost the local authorities a further  5*0 million andmust obviously be phased over a longer period.   I suggest we announce a10-year programme.   Allowing for a slow build up, I think the followingsums should be allocated during the PESC period, leaving about a further 10 million a year to be found in the remaining 6 years of the programme.  million1972/73 J?7?/74 1?7V75 ,1 5 10 109.      I believe that there is appeal in these programmes and that localauthorities would respond to a really intensive and specific drive,especially as it would involve them in very little consequential revenue expenditure apart from the cost of servicing loans.   I am satisfied thatthe programmes are realistic and attainable.10.      I am sure that we also need to take new initiatives in the hospital field.I have already referred to the need for a radical replacement programme for existing unsatisfactory geriatric hospitals and for substantial new building for the increasing numbers of the elderly.   Many of the presenthospitals are quite intolerable and it is essential that we provide decentconditions if we are to attract the nurses we need.   It should be possibleto find the  6 million a year needed for additional places from the mainbuilding programme, provided the programme is increased as I have proposed above.   But in addition to this I believe we must be seen to be making aspecial effort, beyond what can be achieved as part of the main programme,to get rid of the really grim and forbidding hospitals and to improvethose which, despite our efforts, are bound to be with us for many yearsyet.   This, together with long overdue improvements in the standard of care for these patients, will involve substantial capital and revenue expenditure and I propose that we should make a significant attack on this problem by setting aside in this PESC period the following additional sumsspecifically for a five-year programme of new hospital units and a three-year programme of upgrading and other improvements.  million1972/73     1973/74     1974/75      1 975/76Capital:   Replacement 4 4 5 7Upgrading 2 2 2Revenue 5 5 6 67.
Mentally Handicapped11,    The main need now is for much more provision for the mentally handicappedin the community.     We know that about 27,000 1 home  places are needed formentall &apos; handicapped adults and children.     The White Paper will show thatno more than about 4,000 of these could be provided within the presentallocations up to 1974/75 and that it will be a further 15 years beforethe remaining 23,000 places (capital -ost about  85 million) are completed at that rate of progress.     We also need 44,000 new places in adult training centres.     The White Paper will show that 10,000 of these could beprovided by 1974/75 and that here too it will be a further 15 years beforethe remaining 34,000 places (capital cost about  40 million) can becompleted.     (These are all figures for England and Wales).     I propose aten-year programme from now for both home places and training centres.     Theadditional programmes would probably have to start slowly, with thefollowing extra expenditure for England in the FKbC period.  million1222/21 197?M 1974/75        1 ?75/76Capital - 3 5 7Revenue - - 1 2Mental Illness12,    Conditions in mental hospitals are the cause of very great concern andimproveHfe shall not be able to defend a failure  to /   the standard of staffing,equipment, food and general maintenance.     A very large sum would berequired to bring all these hospitals up to an acceptable standard.     Ithink we ought to make progress by increasing expenditure in 1972/73 byabout  4 million and maintaining this higher level in subsequent years.Other Personal Social Services13.    I have mentioned the local authority services for the elderly and the mentally handicapped.     There are other areas of the personal social services where we need to tackle social deprivation more quickly, particularly toenable more of the deprived and handicapped to live at home in thecommunity.     We need more family advice centres, day nurseries, observationand assessment facilities, and controlled community homes and units wherefamilies may be kept together with the aid of social workers when otherwise the children would have to be taken into care.     I propose the following
additional expenditure to enable these important needs to be met more quickly than will otherwise be possible.  millionim/ll T973M 197^75 1975/762 6 8 1014,    There are many other parts of the health and personal social services on which smaller additional sums ought to be spent.     Three which haveparticular claims for special programmes are:Deaths from firesWe know that many hospitals are deficient in their provision of precautions against the risk of fire.     They will be below the standards proposed in new legislation on protection, escapes, alarms and appliances.     They are unlikely to be able to meet the cost quickly from within the normal building programme and we therefore need a special injection of  2 million capital a year in1972/73 and 1973/74 to make it plain that we intend to bring hospitals up todate in these important requirements.Children&apos;s Units15... There is a good deal of public disquiet that there are still many areas where it is necessary to accommodate children in adult wards, or wherechildren are in wards not suited to their needs.     I believe we should make an urgent and substantial effort towards eliminating this problem, and forthis purpose I shall need to incur the following additional expenditure:-  million1973/7? 1973/74 .197^75 1975/76Capital 1 2 2 -Revenue - 0.2 0.5 1.01.0 2.2 2.5 1.0Accident Services16.    A study of the accident and emergency services has shown that aconsiderable programme of rationalisation and reorganisation is necessary and my Department has given guidance to hospital authorities on how thisshould be done.     Progress within the normal building programme is likelyto be slow and I therefore propose an intensive attach on this problem inthe next four years.9
The additional expenditure required will be:  million1972/731973/741974/751975/76Capital2345Revenue0.51223.557Methods of achieving additional local authority expenditure.17o   Much of the additional expenditure proposed above is in services for whichthe local authorities are primarily responsible.   It is here that, in terms ofnational priorities, the immediate needs are great.   And yet it is here that themeans of control and influence are weakest.   In the interests of the most efficient use of scarce national resources we need to encourage preventiveservices (which will save recourse to more expensive services later);    to developforms of care which will ease the burden on the hospitals (e.g. by reducing thenumber of needlessly long-stay patients in hospital beds);    or to increase theefficiency of the Executive Council services (e.g. by using social workers toassist general practitioners).   The Seebohm reorganisation is providing the organisational instrument, but we must be able to assist its growth. We must,therefore, ensure that;-a0   the healthy development of capital programmes by the new local authoritydepartments, in directions which fit national priorities, is notthwarted by inadequate total provision for loan approvals;    and b.   a balanced programme of capital investment in this field is notthwarted and distorted by overall cuts in relevant current expenditure which gear the programme, not to long-term priorities in public expenditure, but to short-term priorities in local revenue expenditure.18.   Because of the weakness of control and influence of general local authority expenditure, I think we should, with some of the additional money I am asking for,continue and develop the Urban Programme, with special reference to the personal social services.   I am well aware of the trend against specific grants to localauthorities, and I fully realise that the Urban Programme is designed primarily to deal, not with specific groups or types of social need, but with particulargeographical areas0   I am not proposing any fundamental change in these concepts.But, since in the particular areas concerned it is clear that some of the helpso far most successfully given or planned is in fact in the field of the personal
social services, I am suggesting that we strengthen the Programme by enabling it - still within its existing purposes and priorities - to operate, in perhaps rather more geographical areas, in still more directsupport of the social work departments of local authorities in&apos;those areaVoluntary Bodies19.    We might well elicit the aid of voluntary bodies in tacl3ing some of the tasks I have listed.     Some of the organisations have a long history ofproviding invaluable help to the most socially-deprived members of thecommunity and could no doubt expand   their efforts in alliance with thestatutory bodies, but only if we assist them financially.     I would therefore propose to explore the possibility of directing a small part ofthe additional provision I am seeking to selected voluntary organisations the results could be very worthwhile.Summary20,    The increases to the normal hospital building programme, the additionaltemporary cost of the reorganisation and the publicly announced specialprogrammes outlined above would result in the following approximate totaladditions to the allocations for the health and personal social services england suggested in this year1 s PESO report.  million1972/7?251975/74561974/75861976/76100Department of Health and social security london   SE111 June 1971
