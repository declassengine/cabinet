CP(71) 68 COPY NO 0121 June 1971CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1975-76Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The 1971 Report of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee whichI circulate under CP(71) 73 presents problems in the short and medium term on which we now have to decide our strategy.2.        We must safeguard what we have achieved so far in fiscal policy,and preserve the prospect of carrying taxation relief further.    Otherwisewe should be abandoning hope of realising some of our main objectives.3.        Our public expenditure programmes in Cmnd 4578 wero consistent with this purpose.    They involved an average annual Increase in real termsof 2.6 per cent (disregarding the rundown of Investment grants) between1969-70 and 1974-75.ADDITIONS ALREADY MADE TO PUBLIC EXPENDITURE4. The costings of existing policies in the new Survey Report, before any of the additional proposals, also rise by 2. 6 per cent from 1970-71 to1975-76.    But the level is higher throughout, as follows:  million at 1971 Survey prices1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75+ 138 4 278 + ZZZ H-195(For the components see table C in the Annex).These Increases are due mainly to policy decisions which we took betweenCmnd 4578 and the 1971 Survey, eg on social security.5. Then come decisions taken, or commitments entered into, since the1971 Survey report was prepared.    These include measures to relieve unemployment; additional steel investment this year; working capital for1
Rolls-Royce; and the public expenditure cost, from 1973-74 onwards, of entering the European Economic Community (e.c.).    (See table D for theamounts, some of which are only approximations).    These add:  million at 1971 Survey prices1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-764 207 ir   81 4-168 +175 4-1901971-726, In my Budget I made allowance for the policy changes which we had decided by then.    As for the rest, there is room this year for the claims which they will make on resources, solely because the economy is runningbelow its full potential capacity.    But these large additions to public spending plans would have to be borne in mind if other proposals for expanding demand were to be brought forward.1972-73 AND 1973-741. Looking to 1972-73 and 1973-74, moreover, I must warn mycolleagues now that if the additions in 2. of Table A had to be accommodatedtogether with increased pressure of demand from elsewhere at the time, we might have to reduce the growth of public expenditure in 1973-74, and perhap seven in 1972-73; and we should need to be prepared in good time to achieve this.1974-75 AND 1975-768.        The assessment of the medium term economic prospect which has just been completed shows that provided our productive potential continueson the past trend and provided that we can manage the economy so that unemployment can safely be reduced somewhat below the present level, weshould have enough resources in the medium term future (about 1975) -a. to meet all the public expenditure requirements implied bythe costings of existing policies, plus the cost of entering the e.c. -that is, the level of expenditure shown for 1974-75 and 1975-76 at. in Table A;b. to keep the burden of taxation no heavier in real terms thanit is at present (though not to reduce it further);c. to have a satisfactory balance of payments surplus, and d. to accommodate a sufficient level of private investment tosupport the growth in productive potential.2
I should stress that this assessment assumes we shall have found a solution to our problem of cost inflation which enables us to keep our balance ofpayments in good shape without disturbing the growth of production.    It isby no means certain that we shall be,able to do,this, and if we failed,, the,.     . ,resources available would be less.    All would imply virtually   for   &apos;    &apos;*-Tebitclaims on resources.    In addition the 1971 Survey Report (paragraph 25(v))notes proposals for unquantifled improvements in social security.9.        It will be clear from what I have said in paragraphs 7 and 8 that ifthe public expenditure programmes were expanded to include all, or any material part of, these further additions, we should not be able to carry out our other policies, notably taxation.    The medium term assessmentshows that in 1975-76 we should have to increase the real burden of taxationif the objectives for private investment and the balance of payments were tobe achieved without excessive strain on our resources.10.       It is imperative therefore that for 1972-.73 onward public expenditure should not rise above the level of our present commitmentsplus the cost of entry to e.c.; that is, 4. in Table A.11.        The proposals in Table B concerning steel involve the special difficulty that we shall not be able to judge how much, if any, additional expenditure is Inescapable until the current Inquiry into the industry is completed towards the end of the year.    Again, therefore, I must warnmy colleagues that if there has to be any material addition for steel in theperiod, other programmes would need to be reduced to accommodate it.12.       As regards the other claims in Table B I see no alternative but thatthe Ministers responsible in each case should seek to make the roomrequired for them by savings within their own programmes.    To the extent that they cannot, we shall need proposals from officials for producing the required offsetting reductions in claims on resources in other programmes.CONCLUSIONS13.       I invite my colleagues -1. To agree that, subject to 2. and 4. below, the public expenditure programmes should be planned and managed so as to conform with the programme costings tabulated in the 1971 SurveyReport, together with our further existing commitments and thepublic expenditure cost of entry into the e.c. as in Table D in thismemorandum, expressed (as in 4. of Table A) as follows?  million at 1971 Survey prices1971-7223,6001972-7323,8751973-7424,2251974-7524,5501975-7624,950
2.        To note that it may be necessary to reduce the rates of increase in public expenditure in 1973-74, and perhaps 1972-73,if pressure of demand in the economy becomes excessive.(Paragraph 7).3.        To agree that Ministers proposing additional expendituresas in Table B (other than in steel investment - see 4. below) should report to the Cabinet by 15 July whether or to what extent they canaccommodate the cost of their proposals within their ownprogrammes as defined in 1.4.        To note that it may be necessary in due course to accommodate additional investment for steel by offsettingreductions elsewhere in public expenditure (paragraph 11).5.        To agree that when ministers reports are available under 3.the Cabinet should consider instructions to officials to prepare, inthe light of those reports and of the considerations in 2. and 4.above, proposals for reallocating the annual totals of public expenditure specified in 1. to the individual programmes, forconsideration by the Cabinet in September,A treasury Chambers SW121 June 1971
