THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(71) 59 COPY NO 6014 May 1971CABINET1971 CENSUS: VOLUNTARY SURVEY OF INCOMESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. The 1971 census did not include any question about personal incomes.When the Order authorising the census was approved by the previousParliament it was indicated that instead the census would be followed by a voluntary survey of incomes., in the form of a questionnaire sent by post toa 1 per cent sample of households.    Preparations for the survey have, under our own authority, reached an advanced stage.    A copy of the list of questions to be asked is attached.    Response to the questionnaire is entirelyvoluntary.    It was planned that a small proporiton of the respondents shouldbe interviewed (again voluntarily) by professional staff of the Office of population Censuses and Surveys as a check on the general validity of the statistics produced.     Hie object of the survey is to enable family income tobe related to other characteristics in order to provide a better factualbackground for decisions on social and economic policy (eg on selectivemeasures of social security).    Existing income statistics, being unrelatedto the census, cannot be used in this way, and this leaves an important gap in the information on which our policies can be based.2. In view of some of the attitudes current at the time of the census, asmall group of Ministers under my chairmanship has been considering whether any factors have arisen which would make it right to modify thedecision to hold the survey.3.        It could be argued that the voluntary nature of the survey shoulddisarm most of the criticisms of the kind that were levelled at the census,especially as the survey does not involve using local enumerators.    Thecollection on a voluntary footing of information of this kind is not a new departure, and much more detailed information about incomes is in factbeing currently collected in the family expenditure survey.    It could bemade clear that the incomes survey was not a new proposal, but was announced to the previous Parliament.    The proposal to hold the survey was in fact mentioned from time to time in dealing with enquiries at the timeof the census, but did not achieve any public prominence.1
40 Some of us nevertheless felt considerable anxiety over the likelypublic reaction to the survey, however much it was emphasised that it wasvoluntary.    It was felt that, so soon after the commotion over the census,many people would be annoyed and unresponsive to a request to providesuch detailed information about their personal incomes.    While were recognised that v/ithout this survey we would be depriving ourselves of agreat deal of statistical information of the kind we need to take properdecisions, there might be a case at least for delaying the survey untilmemories of the census were less fresh,    A delay to the autumn would reduce the statistical effectiveness of the survey since in the meantimea number of the selected households would have moved or changed theircomposition,,    On the other hand, with the census well over, people might perhaps be rather more responsive,5. We considered that a number of steps should be taken to improve thearrangements for the survey,    The covering letter to heads of householdsshould be signed by the Secretary of State for Social Services and shouldstress firmly the voluntary character of the operation.    We have also asked that special care should be taken over the follow--up interviews, so that theydo not appear to be over-exigent or inquisitive;  and that those who do notrespond to the postal questionnaire should not be interviewed at all, lestany doubt should be cast on the truly voluntary character of the operation.Our conclusion was that, in order to test public reactions, an arrangedQuestion should be put down for written answer by the Secretary of State for social Services, asking him when it was proposed to carry out the voluntarysurvey to which reference was made in the debate on the census Order,The reply would be to the effect that the survey would be carried out&quot;shortly&quot;.    It should then be possible to judge from the public reaction tothis answer whether the survey operation could be more successfullyperformed in the immediate future or in the autumn.    However, we reached this conclusion before the report in the Guardian on 11 Mayalleging that personal records were accessible to private informationagencies;  and in view of the current feeling over these matters we thoughtit right to bring the matter before the Cabinet.R m home Office SW114 May 1971
