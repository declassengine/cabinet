DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 136 COPY NO g(j19 November 1974CABINETi i/i ;PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PRIORITIESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The Cabinet on 5 November gave general approval to the approach inmy memorandum C(74) 120.    I was asked to consult further with theMinisters concerned to see what further adjustments could be made inorder to accommodate desired changes within the agreed guidelines, andthen to circulate definitive proposals,2. The framework within which we have to plan our expenditure is this:i. As regards 1975-76, we face expenditure which is alreadynearly  3 billion (at constant 1974 Survey prices) higher than thelevel which our predecessors planned for that year before the priceof oil began its five-fold increase.    This is due to our increases in housing, social security, subsidies for food and the nationalised industries, debt interest and expenditure in Northern Ireland.    i cannot contemplate adding still more to the total in order to restoreother programmes to the levels which our predecessors gave intheir last White Paper but in effect withdrew at once following the cuts of December 1973.ii. As regards the period to 1978-79, we have announced thatthe increase in public expenditure will be limited to the average annual rate of 2-f per cent in demand terms.3. In the light of these points and my consultations with my colleagues,I propose that the illustrative scheme in C(74) 120 should be modified totake the form of the table attached.    This involves dealing with the outstanding issues in the following way.4,        a.        Overseas AidI invited my colleagues to consider adding  9 million in 1975-76.The Minister for Overseas Development asked for a further 21 million, making  30 million in all.    I am not objecting to this
but in order to avoid a reduction which would otherwise appear in1976-77 I have suggested that she should distribute it so that 24 million would fall in 1975-76 and  6 million in 1976-77.    I am not pressing my suggestion of a redaction of  10 million in 1978-79.b. EducationThis is the programme from which the greatest volume of savingsover the period is being secured.    I invited my colleagues toconsider adding  15 million to the capital programme for education in 1975-76 and  7 million in 1976-77, while the building industry islightly loaded.    Even with these additions the Secretary of Statefeels that he cannot provide enough nursery school places to honourreferences in the Manifesto and The Queenfs Speech (which he didnot advocate).    I am prepared to add  3 million for this purpose in1975-76, provided that the rest of the settlement which I propose inth:ts memorandum is accepted so that I know the extent of myI icommitment.c. School MealsAn essential element in the savings on education expenditure is theproposal to increase the charge for school meals by 3p in 1975 and each subsequent year.    An increase of 3p would increase the retail price index by 0.1 per cent.    I ask my colleagues to agree that thefirst of these should be introduced from April next, when the family allowances are being increased.d. Health and Personal Social services  have asked for no reductions in the Survey figures for health and Ihave proposed the addition to the health programme for 1975-76 of 35 million, mainly because of a backlog of maintenance.    I canonly do this if my other proposals in this memorandum are accepted,I have told the Secretary of State that I cannot meet her furtherspecific requests, which are for  16 million for capital expenditureon health in 1975-76 and  1 million in that year and another 11 million over the rest of the period for personal social services.e. Social security  have provided for the basic pension of  10- 16 this year; a majorimprovement of disregards for supplementary benefits; regularuprating of pensions in line with earnings (twice next year); upratingof family allowances next year;  new benefits for the disabled;introduction of child allowances from April 1977, extended to firstchildren; and introduction of the earnings-related pension scheme from April 1978.    The Secretary of State has asked in addition for
extension of family allowances to first children of one-parent families from April 1976 at a net Exchequer cost of up to 7^ million, which in my view would seriously risk increasing the subsequent cost of family endowment for children generally by up to 100 million a year.    In view of all the other pressures I am notprepared to accept this or any other extra commitment in this field.f. Law and OrderI asked the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Lord Chancellor to find between them savings of  25 million in1978-79.    They have found  23 million; my discussions with theLord Chancellor are not yet complete,g. defence total of  3, 700 million for 1975-76 has been agreed.    TheSecretary of State for Defence would be prepared to accept figuresof  3g800 million for each year from 1976-77 to 1978-79, provided they were qualified as provisional pending not only final defence review decisions after completion of the process of consultationwith our Allies, but also the preparation of the 1975 Defence LongCostings.    While for presentational reasons the defence budgetfigures may need to be described in the Public Expenditure white paper as provisional until we have established the final outcome ofthe Defence Review, in my view we need to decide on firm totals forour own planning now, and I do not think I can accommodate any higher figure than  3, 750 million in 1978-79 ( 138 million above thenotional provision in the Survey), with figures in the intervening years of  3, 700 million in 1976-77 and  3,750 million in 1977-78.h. HousingI invited my colleagues to consider adding  100 million gross( 85 million net) in 1978-79 for lending by local authorities for purchase of houses and  65 million for lending by the housing corporation for building of houses.    I consider this acceptablesubject to securing the offsetting reductions listed in paragraph 5below.i. RailwaysI suggested a reduction of  50 million in investment plans, but theSecretary of State does not consider it possible to accept this inadvance of further examination of the criteria.
L Minor ItemsI noted in table 3 of C(74) 120 a number of minor proposals from mycolleagues,    I propose that I should now settle these in discussionwith the Ministers directly concerned,5.        The net effect of items a, and f. -i. in the previous paragraph wouldbe to add  350 million to the expenditure under my illustrative scheme for1978-79, and j. a further small amount.    The offsets available to set against this are as follows&quot;   million7 \ / &apos;i. Nationalised industries&apos; shortfall -foreshadowed but not scored in C(74) 120 200ii. Housing subsidies - differential rates for newhousesiii. Elimination of provision for the rail link for theChannel Tunnel6.        The savings are somewhat less than the additions.    Moreover, j.has also to be offset and there is a risk that in the event some provisionfor the rail link for the Channel Tunnel will have to be reinstated.Nevertheless, overall these changes should not significantly affect public sector demand on resources.    I am prepared to accept the balance struckin paragraph 5 as the means of complying with our limit for 1978-79.CONCLUSIONS7.        I invite my colleagues -a. To approve my proposals in paragraph 4 for additional expenditure or forgoing of savings, and in paragraph 5 for offsetting savings,iib. To agree that the charge for school meals should be increasedby 3p from April 1975 (paragraph 4c).c. To accept in consequence the attached table as the basis forthe Public Expenditure White Paper.D treasury Chambers19 November 1974/   3559294
