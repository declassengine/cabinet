Accordingly officials in the UK and in the Embassyand Consular Posts in South Africa are seeking cppartaities to draw the attention of businessmen to the Code of Practice and to stress the Governments endorsement of it.   Officials willalso continue to give information to businessmen on request.Supplementary guidance on labour matters in South Africa isbeing prepared and will be sent to all British companies withaffiliates employing Africans in South Africa.   Copies willalso be available for distribution to business visitors.RECOMMENDATION&quot;That companies be invited to submit reports on their practices and on progress concerning African wages and conditions&quot;,(paragraph 189)h      The Government agree with the Select Committee that publication of information on        companies1 progress towardsthe objectives of the Code of Practice is an important meansof encouraging and persuading others, and that companies should expect continuing publicity for their performance in this field.The Government also believe that Parliament and the public
should have access to information allowing judgements to he made on the progress achieved by companies.   Parent companies in this country will accordingly he invited to publish regularlyin their annual reports to shareholders, chairman&apos;s statement,or in any other convenient form, the information specified in annex 2 to demonstrate progress in raising non-white wagesabove PDL rates and towards the MEL.5      Companies will also be encouraged to report as fully aspossible on other important matters covered by the Code of practice such as the opportunities for African advancement anddevelopment of collective bargaining including details ofexisting channels of consultation on wages and working conditions,the scope of such arrangements and how wages are determined; the names of any African trade unions that are recognised by thecompany and, if any have applied for recognition, the results ofsuch applications; any employers&apos;  associations to which thesubsidiaries or associated companies are affiliated.    information on fringe benefits provided for Africans (eg education, medical care, housing, legal assistance, pensions, training, food/ meals(especially in respect of mining undertakings), leave and sickleave) could also usefully be included.RECOMMENDATION&quot;That a review be undertaken of staff in South Africa and in      )!IIII7I7K . r. -11the DTI whose function it is to provide information, assistancerestricted

As already announced the Embassy&apos;s staff will be strengthened by the addition of a first Secretary (Labour) so that these functions can he carriedout more comprehensively than in the past.RECOMMENDATION&quot;That the Inland Revenue should issue public guidance on how the control over the issue of directives to subsidiaries on labour matters renders the subsidiaries liable to UK tax andthat if necessary there should he legislative change&quot;,(paragraph 191)7 The Inland Revenue have prepared the statement at Annex 3which is intended to allay any:, doubts in the minds of parentcompanies about the risk of bringing an overseas subsidiary into
restricted-5-liability to UK tax through the issue of policy directives tothe subsidiary on wages and conditions of employment.   wide publicity is being given to this statement.   The Governmentare satisfied that there is no need for legislative change andthat companies can proceed with confidence in the light of the inland Revenue guidance to implement the Code of Practicewithout fear of prejudice to the tax position of their SouthAfrican affiliates
Annex 1STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR trade MAY 197kSOUTH AFRICA (BRITISH FIRMS)The Secretary of State for Trade and President of the Board of   /Trade (Mr Peter Shore): With permission I should like to make astatement about the Governments initial views on the recommend-ations in the Fifth Report of the Expenditure Committee on thewages and conditions of African workers employed by British firms in South Africa.This was a somewhat unusual field of inquiry for a. Select Committee.The whole House will wish to congratulate my hon. Friend the member for Stockton (Mr Rodgers) and his colleagues on the Trade andIndustry Sub-Committee on the thoroughness of this inquiry and theadmirable report which they have produced.We accept the main recommendation that the Government should issueamplified guidance to British firms on the wages and working conditions of African workers.    The Report contains an admirablyfull and clear statement of recommended practices which, ifimplemented conscientiously, could lead;to very real improvements.As recommended by the Committee, I am now arranging to give the code of Practice wide publicity.   I shall write personally to thoseBritish firms with South African interests.   My letter and the textwill be issued to the Press, as will the list of those to whom I amwriting.   Naturally we also accept that the guidances should beup-dated when necessary.Key recommendations in the guidelines are that no British firm inSouth Africa should pay adult male African employees wages belowthe appropriate poverty datum level, and that all firms should aimwithin a set timetable to pay minimum wages equal to the minimumearnings level broadly equivalent to poverty datum level plus 50per cent.   Elsewhere the report rightly stresses the responsibilityof parent firms for the employment practices of South Africanaffiliates.   These are the basic lessons of the inquiry and it isnow for industry to put them into practice.The report contained a number of other recommendations on informingand advising firms on overseas industrial relations and on monitoringtheir performance.   These proposals are being given urgent and careful study by the Departments concerned as well as consultation with bothsides of industry.    I shall inform the House of the outcome [in &apos; due course.(Hansard Cols 1156-1157)

ANNEX 3TAXATION OF PROFITS OF SUBSIDIARIES OF UNITED KINGDOM COMPANIESThe Inland Revenue have been asked to provide public guidance on the taxation consequences of the exercise of control byparent companies in the United Kingdom over the employment and wages policies of their subsidiaries operating abroad.(Fifth report of the Expenditure Committee, Session 1973-7U,Wages and Conditions of African Workers Employed by british firms in South Africa, 22 January 197k)i.The following statement is issued in response to that request.1     A company is resident in the United Kingdom (and henceliable to United Kingdom corporation tax on its wfprldwideprofits) if the central management and control of its businessare exercised in the United Kingdom.    (Central management andcontrol is distinct from the voting control exercisable byshareholders.)   This rule has to be applied to&apos; the facts ofeach particular case but if for example the meetings of the directors who manage the company&apos;s business are held in theUnited Kingdom the central management and control of thecompany would normally be regarded as exercised in the UnitedKingdom and the company would be resident here for tax purposes.2     Where a company operating overseas is a subsidiary of a united Kingdom resident company, the question to be answered 1is whether participation in the management and control of the subsidiary company&apos;s business by the parent company is of sucha character as to indicate that the subsidiary is resident inthe United Kingdom.    Precise and comprehensive rules cannot belaid down but the following comments may help to clarify mattersBecause the question has arisen in the context of guidelinesand directives on employment and wages policies these are used as Illustrations but they would not be the only factors.   Allthe facts and circumstances would have to be taken into account.3     Guidance on. non-discriminationThe Inland Revenue would not regard a parent company asexercising the central management and control of a subsidiarysolely because the parent directed the board of the subsidiarynot to discriminate between its employees on racial grounds orto pay its employees at rates above the minimum level,k     Guidance on employment and wages policy generally the mere issue by a parent company of general guidelines forthe board of the subsidiary on employment and wages policies ,.would in the Inland Revenue&apos;s view be unlikely to indicate thatit was managing or controlling the subsidiary.    Similarly, theissue of specific policies on wages and conditions, specifyingsuch matters as rates of wages to be paid or increases in thoserates, as guidelines for the board of the subsidiary, which it  ,,was:free to follow or ignore, would not of itself be likely to /indicate the exercise of the central management and control by !the parent company.
restricted- 2 -5     Directives concerning employment and wages policy 1In itself, the issue of directives of a general nature &quot;by the parent company laying down employment or wages policies to hefollowed by the subsidiary would not be regarded as indicating the exercise of central management and control.   However,directives specifying particular conditions of employment orwages rates would normally suggest that a degree of central management and control of a subsidiary was being exercised bythe parent company but would not necessarily be conclusive^evidence that the subsidiary was resident in the United Kingdomh ii .
