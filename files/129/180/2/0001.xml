THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST y*S government(74) 127 COPY NO     g Q5 November 1974CABINETPAY OF TEACHERS IN scotland memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland, I would like to inform my colleagues about the situation which has arisen in Scotland as a result of recent discussions about teachers1 pay andof the action which, subject to further consultation with the Secretary ofState for Education and Science, I would propose to take,2.        In May of this year the Government recognised that the pay of nursesand teachers had fallen behind and decided to appoint independentCommittees to review the pay of members of these professions,    A&quot;Committee under Lord Halsbury was appointed to deal with the nurses; andon 24 May the Secretary of State for Education and Science and I appointed aCommittee under Lord Houghton &quot;to examine the pay structure and levels of remuneration of non-university teachers in Great Britain&quot;,    We said in apublic statement appointing the Committee that &quot;The recommendations of the review body will be referred to the appropriate negotiating machinery inEngland, Wales and Scotland which will be free to decide to backdate anyresulting increases in pay to the date of this announcement&quot;.3. The appointment of the Houghton Committee was generally welcomedand it looked for some time as if the teaching profession would be content to await its recommendations - even although in Scotland there was a good dealof disruption in some schools as a result of unilateral decisions by the mainteachers&apos; organisation to encourage a &quot;work-to-rule&quot; in favour of reducedclass sizes and other improved conditions.4.        Just before the Election the Teachers&apos; Side of the Scottish TeachersSalaries Committee made a claim for an interim payment of 10 per centpending the outcome of the Houghton Report.    This led to a series ofcomplicated negotiations, the result of which, after Ministerial discussion,was that the claim was turned down by the Management Side.    I amrepresented on the Management Side and this decision was made only as aresult of my seeing personally the other members (local authorityrepresentatives) most of whom were firmly convinced that an interimpayment should be made immediately.    I was however able to suggest to theManagement Side (after having consulted the Secretaries of State for
Education and Science and for Employment) that they might indicate their willingness to make an interim payment immediately on receipt of theHoughton Report.    This was conveyed by them to the teachers but it was not acceptable.    The outcome was a one-day strike of most teachers on31 October, and we now have threats of three-day strikes in selected areas for an indefinite period.5.        We are therefore faced at present in Scotland with a very unhappysituation in the schools.    In addition to official three-day strikes in certain areas, there have been, and will continue to be, outbursts of strike action by various unofficial action groups.    This is obviously disturbing to children&apos;seducation and many parents are naturally concerned and confused about whatis happening.6.        The Management Side in turning down the claim preserved theconfidentiality of Management Side discussions] but it seems to be widelyassumed in Scotland that the Secretary of State wa^^responsible for rejecting the claim for an immediate increase.    I think our position isreadily defensible provided the Houghton Committee does in fact reportfairly soon and we are able to arrange for an interim payment very quicklythereafter.    Ideally this would best be done on the same kind of basis as the interim payment which was made.to nurses on the day after publication of the-Halsbury Report.7.        I therefore propose in consultation with the Secretary of State for education and Science to see whether it will be possible to make arrange-ments for the payment in December of an interim award which will not cutacross the recommendations of the Houghton Report.W RScottish office November 19742
