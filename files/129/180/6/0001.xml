I HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S government(74)13l COPY NO        g Q11 November 1974CABINETTHE SIMONSTOWN AGREEMENTS- wMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Defenceii,1, The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in his memorandum c(74) 119 proposed that I should give my views on the military consequences of closing Simonstown and the alternative facilities that would be required.In the light of the Cabinet1 s discussion on Thursday, 31 October(CC(74) 42nd Conclusions), I am circulating this note for the information ofmy Cabinet colleagues and as background to our further deliberations.THE AGREEMENTS2.        The Simonstown Agreements provide for:a. The continued use by the Royal Navy in peace and war ofthe Naval Base at Simonstown.    The facilities include berthing,maintenance, docking, fuel and access to naval communications.The facilities could be used in a war not involving South Africaonly by mutual agreement.b. Co-operation in the defence of sea routes aroundSouthern Africa.    Commander-in-Chief Fleet is responsible for joint maritime war planning and for the organisation and conductof combined training in peacetime.    In war he is responsible forthe conduct of maritime operations and has operational command of all forces assigned to the area by Britain and South Africa.CURRENT USE BY ROYAL NAVY3. In peacetime the Agreements enable us - at no cost to ourselves -to deploy ships or groups of ships in the South Atlantic and Eastwards ofthe Cape with a minimum of afloat support.4. They provide us with our only docking and maintenance facilitiesbetween Gibraltar and Singapore - a distance of 10, 400 nautidal miles via the Cape - and with one of the very few ports around the world wherenuclear-powered submarines are received.1
5. South African ports also provide rest and recreation facilities forthe crews of our ships - especially those engaged on the Beira patrol bymeans o  which we fulfil our United Nations responsibility in relation to rhodesia - of a kind which are not available elsewhere in the area.6.        Diego Garcia is not a substitute for Simonstown, nor are BlackAfrican ports, such as Mombasa, even if we could rely upon their useindefinitely.7.        Since February 1974 at least six Royal Navy ships have used shorefacilities at Simonstown for necessary repairs which could not haye beendone elsewhere in the area. //STRATEGIC FACTORS8, Unlike Western Europe the Soviet Union has no substantial shippingor vital trading interests to protect in the Indian Ocean.9. Nevertheless Soviet influence in the area is growing. In 1970there -was an average of only 9 Soviet naval units in the Indian Ocean;their average deployment in 1974 was 30 ships.10,       The Soviet Navy has also established operating facilities at Berberain Somalia and at Aden,    Their ability to increase their forcessubstantially has also been demonstrated and the reopening of the suez canal will add flexibility to their deployments,1L        The possible need for British participation in maritime operations in the focal area of the Cape arises from the need to preserve an evidentcapability, in the face of the Soviet threat, to assist in safeguardingsupplies to this country and to our European allies in tension or war.For example, over 1000 merchant ships on average pass the Cape each month, of which about half are tankers.    Of these some 180 and 90respectively are United Kingdom Flag ships.12,       Even after North Sea oil is being fully exploited, Western europe will still be dependent for substantial crude supplies coming round the cape in tankers too large to transit the Suez Canal.13.       Against this background the value of the Simonstown arrangements is two-fold:a. The guaranteed availability of good base facilities, including a dry dock, greatly facilitates the operation of British and inwartime Allied warhips East of the Cape.    They require, lesselaborate afloat support and there is less likelihood, should somebreakdown occur, of embarrassing difficulty in dealing with it.  .2
b. More importantly, they offer the only means by which theWest can realistically hope to safeguard shipping routes aroundSouthern Africa.    Without them it would not be possible for us toplay our part in mounting a credible defence of shipping in the area and this fact would be recognised by friend and foe alike.14.       The Agreements envisage the defence of shipping as comprising:fir stly, the provision of communications, command and control, base,bunkering and repair facilities for the Royal Navy (and other allied maritime forces) operating in the area;  secondly,, the maintenance of theefficiency of the South African Navy so that it could work effectively withthe Royal Navy;  and, thirdly, co-operation with Allied and friendly forces.15.       We must expect opposition to termination of the Agreements fromthe major British shipping interests.    The National Union of Seamen in aletter to &quot;The Times&quot; published on 7 November has already expressed concern at the possibility that the Simonstown facilities should be denied to us.MILITARY CONSEQUENCES OF ABROGATION16.       Termination of the Agreements would relieve the South Africans oftheir obligation to maintain up to date facilities for our warships atSimonstown.    It would also lessen the importance which they attach to theSouth African Navy and we would expect a diversion of their resources toother military purposes.17,       In consequence the entire arrangements for the defence of Alliedshipping on the Cape routes, including our national responsibility for theNaval Control of Merchant Shipping (nos.) in an emergency, could be undermined.18.       These arrangements are a significant feature of NATO&apos;s andSACLANT&apos;s plans for the defence of shipping outside the existing NATOboundaries.    NATO!s requirement fov ah nos. organisation outside the nato area was established in 1959 and in 1962 Britain was designated theCo-ordinating Nation in the sea areas around the Southern AfricanContinent.19.       Termination would not, however, prevent us from deploying shipsinto the Indian Ocean; though this would become less convenient and more expensive.WIDER CONSIDERATIONS20.       The significance of these arrangements in the light of the defence review is now to be discussed with our Allies.3
21.       Although the Agreements bring us political embarrassment insome quarters, they also confer some standing upon us in the eyes of our allies, especially the Americans who look to us to share some of theburden which they carry in the Indian Ocean;  and, I believe, in the eyes of the Shah, who is also concerned at the build-up of Soviet maritimestrength in the area and whose Navy makes use of the Simonstownfacilities.22.       The value of these Agreements, and our relations with South africa as a whole, must also be viewed against the background of these wider considerations, and of their possible value in the longer term future.R MMinistry of Defence8 November 1974
