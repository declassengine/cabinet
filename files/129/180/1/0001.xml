HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74)1265 November 1974COPY NOCABINETSUGARMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food the WORLD PRICE1, Since I circulated my memorandum C(?4) 117 the world market priceof sugar has again moved sharply upwards.    By Friday the spot price was 480 per ton and ths December Matures price no less than  570.    Theimmediate reasons for this nre said to be renewed buying by the UnitedStates refiners and strong rnmours that Russia has now entered the market for substantial quantities,    Theprospect of the Community&apos;s import sub -sidy is also affecting sentiment.    With the United States, Russia and theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) likely.to be bidding agalnat eachother for the limited quantities of sugar available between now and thebeginning of the Southern Hemisphere season in the second half of 1975,some traders believe the price could go to  600 or  700.EFFECT ON SUPPLIES2. The higher the world price goes, the smaller the chance 6f burgetting any significant quantities of sugar from the West Indies in the firdthalf of 1975.    United States refiners are prepared to pay the world price;and Jamaica, Trinidad and Barbados are anxious to establish themselves as substantial suppliers of the United States market against the possibilityof renewed United States import quotas at some time in the future.    If the spot price went to  600 and the futures price for a year ahead to, say,  400,the West Indies would be able to ensure at once an average return of  500for two seasons - equivalent to seven years&apos; sales at the presentCommonwealth Sugar Agreement price of  140.    Thus the Caribbeansuppliers will be under a strong temptation to reject or defer even a generous long-term deal under Protocol 22 or to sign it and fail to deliver;and other developing Commonwealth countries might follow their example,at any rate in part.3.        As my colleagues will realise from my earlier paperj there is nosimple way out of this problem through a deal with Australia.    They haverelatively little sugar available in the crucial first half of 1975 and theirgrowers will also want a higher price now in any long-term deal.1
conclusions,        I think there are four conclusions to be drawn from this:-i0 We must do all we can to enable our port refiners to buy-world market sugar and to get Community subsidy on it when it isimported from next February.    This means persuading the british sugar Corporation to sell them sugar from the 1975 crop;  lendingthe refiners money to fund the purchase of world market sugar; andinsuring them against the risks they run in buying forward, whichare too great for the companies themselves to take,    I am exploringthe financial aspects urgently with the Paymaster General.ii.        We must get the Protocol 22 arrangements for a long-termagreement with the developing Commonwealth settled as soon aspossible, and at a realistic price level - which will now almost certainly have to exceed  140.iiu       We must still hold the Community to its promise to subsidise the import of the whole deficit in supplies.    For theCommunity as a whole this could be upwards of a million tons,requiring a. total subsidy possibly in excess of  300 million if theprice were to be subsidised down to threshold price levels.    In such circumstances it would probably become necessary to accept a farhigher price for British consumers than at present, given theprospect of the world price for cane raws (as opposed to beet) stillifiAj - sowing.    Meanwhile the Community needs to decide quickly on arrangements to succeed those for the first 200, 000 tons, or it willrun the risk of finding available supplies cornered by others, or theprice and subsidy cost at deterrent levels.iv.       Finally, we have to recognise that with a total importrequirement of over two million tons during the next 12 months weare in a very vulnerable position.    The only absolutely certain wayof maximising supplies and refinery throughout would be for theGovernment itself to buy at once as much cane sugar as can beobtained on the world market.    I do not recommend this course.The cost of obtaining, say, 600, 000 tons - if this could be found -would be anywhere from  300 million to  400 million.    Our chances of getting e.c. subsidy on its importation would be greatly reduced ifit were to become known, as it would, that we were the purchasers.And although I suspect consumers would pay the price, if it wereaveraged over the whole supply, I do not think that the advantages ofa less restricted supply of sugar justify deliberately incurring a balance of payments cost of this magnitude.    But if we do not do this - and perhaps even if we did - I must warn that there is risk ofan acute shortage in the spring and summer, with all that this entails.TIPMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food4 November 1974:: 2 -CONFIDENTIAL
