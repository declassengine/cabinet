PART IGENERAL1 The Secretary or State for Prices and Consumer Protectionannounced on 11 July 197k that a major review of the Price Code,established under the Counter-Inflation Act 1973, was to be begunimmediately.     This followed two broad measures introduced bythe Government soon after taking office - the initiation of consultations on proposals to strengthen the existing Price Codeand the introduction of a new Prices Bill.2 The measures to strengthen the Price Code which, afterconsultations, came into effect early in May, included thefollowing? -a) The frequency with wnich manufacturers and thosein service industries could make price increaseswas limited in principle to not more than once, Ineach three months, although the need for exceptionswas recognised;b) The permissible gross percentage margirls of non-food distributors, other than smaller traders, were reduced by 10$ with effect from 6 May.     On 1 april the Price Commission had, under powers conferred upon them by.the previous administration, introducedsimilar reductions for food distributors.c) The repricing on shop shelves of goods boughtfrequently by the housewife was restricted.3 The Prices Act, which^received the Royal Assent on9 July, provided powers to pay food subsidies and to fixprices for food and for certain other necessities.     Underthese powers subsidies have been introduced   or increased on milk, butter, bread, cheese, household flour and tea, and maximum prices and, where appropriate, margins are being proscribed
A voluntary agreement was also concluded with the retail trades and food manufacturers following the 10% reduction in grossmargins, under which they agreed to sell a list of basic foodsand other essential items at favourable prices.   The PridesAct also provided power to abolish the Pay Board^ and this was done on 26 July under the Counter-Inflation (Abolition of pay board) Order 197U ($1 197k No 1218);   with the removal therebyof the statutory control on wages what had hitherto been knownas the &quot;Price and Pay Code&quot; became the &quot;Price Code&quot;.k        In launching the fundamental review of the Price Code,the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protectionsaid:-&quot;The review will be directed, first, to possiblechanges in the Code which would encourage theindustrial efficiency and productive investmenton which our future employment and wealth as a nation depend, and, secondly, to difficulties oranomalies which experience has identified inparticular industries or sectors of the economy.&quot;The Secretary of State added that for the present no consultative document was being issued but views were invited from the confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress,the Retail Consortium and other representative bodies, as wellas from the Price Commission, nationalised industries, and consumer organisations.     It was made clear that any firm, tradeunion or representative organisation was most welcome to offerviewSj and steps were taken to see that this invitation was widely known.     A great many representative organisations and individual firms have offered the Government views and suggestions.5        The Government have considered the action which should betaken both in the Budget and on the Price Code in the lightof the latest economic assessment.     That part or the Government1sproposals which relates to the Price Code is in this document.The more important changes are discussed generally in the following paragraphs, while Part II provides a commentary on all theproposed amendments and a revised text of the Code as itwould appear under the proposals.
6        The Government believe that it is desirable that thenew Price Code should enter into effect as soon as possible.The intervention of the General Election has unavoidablymeant that the operation or the new Code will be later thanenvisaged in the original programme.     They intend, therefore,that the consultations required by Section 2 of the CounterInflation Act 1973 should be conducted as quickly as isrpracticable;   and following consideration of views or furtherviews expressed by representative organisations, individual firms or trade unions. /[ they will make thenew Code Order, and the necessary associated Orders, as earlyin December as possible.     The new Price Code can come intoforce shortly after the Order is made but,  in accordance with section 2 of the Counter-Inflation Act 1973* it requires theapproval of both Houses of Parliament.7        Many organisations and firms in industry, t?ade and commercehave urged that the price control should be abandoned following the abolition of the Pay Board and the Pay Code:    and that theerosion of profit margins that has occurred as a result of theoperation of the Code up to the present time, and which would continue with greater severity in prospective economic conditions,poses serious threats both to employment and to the level of investment.    As an alternative to the complete removal of price control, organisations and firms have proposed that the detailedcost control should be abandoned and reliance placed only uponthe control of profit margins0     In launching the review, theSecretary of State made it plain that it was the Government&apos;intention that the Price Commission and the Price Code shouldcontinue to provide an effective control over unjustifiableprice increases and to require price reductions wherever possible.In the consultations that have taken place since then, theSecretary of State has reiterated this view and emphasized thatan effective price and profit control is an essential support tothe Social Contract.     At the same time the Government recognisethat greater efficiency in the use of resources, higher exports and job opportunities all depend on industry&apos;s capacity andSFCKET
willingness to invest and innovate and ,in the competitivevigour with which it responds to market opportunities.The Price Code must be adapted to meet these requirements.Investment Relief8        A principal change proposed in the Code is therefore toprovide a new relief from the full effect of the cost andprofit control available to firms which undertake investment incertain selected forms.     Companies will be entitled to recover17j    of firmly budgeted capital expenditure on investment forthe home market provided that this investment is for plant and machinery or industrial buildings.     The relief will apply toall firms in manufacturing, services and distribution but notto nationalised industries (where investment programmes are inany case subject to Government review) .9        It is clearly essential that relief given for investment should be followed by investment.     The Code will thereforerequire that any firm which :. has fallenbelow its programme must hold back to the necessary extent on other price increases allowed under the Code;   and for the,,     , ,at regular intervalslarger firms the Price Commission will be provided with information to check the progress of investment against each company1s programmeso that the relief will be fully accountable.10      The existing powers of the Price Commission under paragraph 70of the Code to permit, on a selective basis, further easementsof the price control where this is necessary tq encourage orensure investment, are being maintained.The Productivit.y Deduction11      The Government consider that the productivity deductionmust remain in operation.     In 1973 it was set at 50%, whenproductivity was generally increasing fast.     But theseconditions no longer exist, particularly while we adjust our production and consumption to higher costs of energy and other materials.   Moreover, now that increases in labour costs, ratherthan increases in the cost of materials, will form a larger .
element in total costs, the pract the productivitydeduction is becoming much more severe.   A fixed percentageproductivity deduction on the basis of unit costs therefore hasa larger proportionate effect on most firms1 profits than was thecase last year.12.   The Government consider that the productivity deduction shouldbe both lower and more selective than at present.   They therefore propose that it should be reduced to a maximum of 35/o v/h ch would apply only to the most capital-intensive products and processes.The standard rate would be 2Cfo and, as in the present Code, thiswould be tapered down to a figure of less than 10;o for the mostlabour-intensive products and processes. These changes will applyto labour cost increases first incurred&apos; on or after 1 November 1974.13.   The Government would be prepared to consider an alternativeapproach if this proved acceptable to both sides of industry whichwould have the same average effect but which would be composedof a lower and a higher rate of productivity deduction.   The rates would depend upon the size of increases in unit labour costs; forexample, the rate of deduction could be expressed as the averageof a lower productivity deduction on increases in unit labour costs up to a certain percentage and a higher productivity deductionon all unit labour cost increases above that percentage.Distribution1L.   as noted in paragraph 8, it is proposed that the investmentrelief should extend to distributors on the same terms as for manufacturing and service industries in the form of an additionto gross and net margins.        &apos;15.   In many cases distributors are operating below the safeguardlevel set last May by the Government at        of net profit margin:reference levels.   In such cases the Government propose to allowdistributors to widen their gross margins to the extent necessaryto achieve the 75/i level of net profit, where market conditionsallow.     At present they cannot do this if this would cause themto exceed 100;* of gross margin:   the Government propose to allowgross margins in such circumstances to be increased to a strictly limited degree, up to 103,0.Safeguardsl6.   The Government consider that the current safeguard for&quot;,manufacturing and service enterprises against erosion of profits in paragraph 34 of the Code should be amended to deal with erosionof profit on product ranges or individual products rather than onthe net profit margin of the enterprise as a whole.   Moreover, itwill not be necessary for a firm to demonstrate, before it caninvoke the safeguard, that the erosion of profit has been causedsolely by the operation of the Code.   In other
words, the safeguard will apply whatever the cause of the erosion, j. these changes will make the safeguards .much easier to wotrie and much more readily available than if companies had to demonstrate, as under the present enterprise-based paragraph 34, that reductions in margins on particular products or ranges [ hi.caused a 10$ erosion in the net profit margins&quot; of the enterprise as a whole.     Itis therefore proposed that the degroe of erosionat which the new safeguard will operate to override the allowableand total cost constraints of the Code should be not one-tenth  but one:third, related to the net profit margin on the product at30 April 1973*     For those firms which suffered considerableprofit erosion during the previous Government&apos;s wage and pricestandstill and thus had unrepresentative net profit margins at30 -April 1973,  the alternative base date or 30 September 1972will be available in certain prescribed circumstances.It is further proposed that, i) as a minimum product prices should be allowedto be raised to cover cost plus a 2$ profit margin;ii) the minimum return below which an enterprise asa whole is not constrained by the rules of the code should be raised from 8% on net assets to&apos; 10,%&apos;  (paragraph 68 of the Code);iii) the equivalent low profit safeguard as a percentage of turnover should be raised fromli$ to 2f0 (paragraph 69) .Nationalised Industry Pricesit      In order to make a significant contribution to the reductionof the price level, the prices of the nationalised industries have for a number of years been restrained more severely thanthose of private sector industries.     The present Code providesthat nationalised industries in deficit - and they are themajority - should be permitted at the most such price increasesas are necessary to contain their deficit to the level of thatin their 1972, or 1972/3, accounting year;    and the generalsafeguard provisions in the Code designed to limit reductions inprofit margins, to give relief for low profits and to encourageinvestment do not protect any of the industries.     However, given
the importance or their prices to the consumer, the industries have not in practice been able to make even such increases as were open to them under the Code and, as a ,result, they havemade increasingly substantial deficits which the Government havefinanced through subsidies.18      In restraining prices in this way, and in financing the growing deficits which have resulted, successive governments have recognised that, taken together, the charges for services provided by nationalised industries are a significant part of household expenditure0     However, the consequences of deficitfinancing become less acceptable the longer it continues.     TheGovernment see, therefore, a need for giving scope for higher price increases by nationalised industries in those cases where such increases would not be inconsistent with the needs of counterinflation policy.     Without increased flexibility of this kindthere&apos; would be little chance of making any progress towards theGovernments objective of returning as many or the industries as possible to a position in which their deficits, and theaccompanying public expenditure on subsidies, are eliminated,and in which they are making a trading surplus as a contributionto their investment programmes, thereby reducing their borrowingrequirements.     The removal of subsidies on fuel would alsocontribute in the longer term to economy in the use of energy.19      Accordingly, the Government propose that, under the newPrice Code, there should be provision for the nationalised industries to make price increases sufficient for them to earn a modest surplus in 1975/76, defined either as 2% on their turnoveror   10$ return on net assets (at the option of theparticular industry).     In certain important respects theposition of nationalised industries is not comparable to thatof the private sector,,     For example, in many cases, they cannotincrease prices as frequently as the private sector.     Theprovisions in the Code for nationalised industries, therefore, have certain features which would not be appropriate to the private sector and the Government propose to retain their power to cutback prices justified under the strict criteria of the Code
to the levels which would be permitted by the allowable costsformula alone.     In these circumstances the role of the price commission will be to calculate both the minimum price increasejustified under the Code, ie allowable costs, and the maximumwhich would be required if a surplus were to be made.     in deciding what price increase should be made it will be necessaryfor Ministers to strike a balance between restoration of theindustries to profitability and the need to keep down the rateof increase in prices to the consumer.Other proposalsSo      The main features of the allowable cost and profit marginrules will remain unchanged.     Amendments have&quot; been made toprovide for changed circumstances since the Code was last revised,to correct anomalies and to clarify the existing rules where necessary.,    The more important changes are:-A)   a new reserve power for use by the Secretary ofState in exceptional circumstances, enablingappropriate action to be taken in the case of anyproduct where a severe shortage of supply is threatened(paragraph 71A of the draft Code)ii)    minor additions to the list of allowable costs(paragraph 28) - the additions to the list will apply to cost increases incurred on or after November 197U:iii)   provision for the speedier recovery ofretrospective and anticipated cost increases(paragraphs 22 and U6);iv)   minor easements in the application of the 3-monthrule (paragraph 26B);v)   a tightening up of the application of the Code tomixed enterprises (paragraph 17);vi)   a revised safeguard provision relating to theapplication of the productivity deduction tovariation-of-price clauses in contracts(paragraph 52);
vii)   exemption from the Code for certain specificcategories of the self-employed (paragraphs(xiv) and (xv) and 103);viii)   clarification of howr depreciation and capitalshould be calculated for the purpose of the code (paragraphs 28 and 68).21A considerable number of changes^will also be made to the associated Notification and Information Orders which enable thePrice Commission to examine proposed price increases and tomonitor the observance of the Code. &quot; The major change which isproposed is that Category III firms, which are at present obligedto keep records of their price increases and profit margins, areto be required to identify themselves to the Price Commission.The Commission proposed this in its quarterly report!; for the period  Karch-31 May 197U* in order to enable its regional staff to monitormore comprehensively the observance of the Code by these firms,especially those which are or considerable importance in theirov/n sectors of industry and commerce.      This! and the other mainchanges in these Orders are briefly described at Appendix 2,together with a proposed amendment to the Counter Inflation(Modification of Civil Aviation Act 1971) Order.the Price Code into operation as early in December ap is practicable and it is hoped that views and representations can22As stated in paragraph 6,be communicated to them by 27 November 197U.
PART IIAMENDMENTS TO THE PRICE CODEEhis part of the Consultative Document is prepared in a form intended to assistthe statutory consultations on amendments to the Price Code which the Governmentare required to undertake by Section 2 of the Counter-Inflation Act 1973*Section I is a commentary on proposed amendments to the Code; Section II is acomplete draft of the Price Code revised so as to ;include the amendments in heavy type.   The paragraph numbers of the existing Code have been retained, and additional paragraphs have been included in heavy type as eg paragraph^A.   Theexisting Code is contained in the Counter-Inflation (Price and Pay Code) (No 2)Order 1973 - SI 1973 No 1785 - as amended by SI (197*0 Nos 661, 785 and 1218.In the revised Code these amending Orders will be consolidated. 11SECTION I - COMMENTARY ON AMENDMENTSParagraph 3(ii);   The objective of encouraging investment is specifically___included in the general principles of the Code, in order to emphasise theintention behind the Government&apos;s proposal to introduce an automatic investmentrelief.Paragraph 6(viii);    The exemption for Goverment. contracts for warlike stores and services is extended to all contracts which are covered by, and subject tothe controls provided in, the profit formula arrangements agreed in 1968 between government and industry in relation to the pricing of non-competitive contracts.The effect will be to exclude from control contracts for non-warlike stores forthe Ministry of Defence and certain equipment for the Property Services agency and the Department of Health and Social Security.Paragraph 6*(ix):     A drafting amendment.Paragraph 6(xiv);    Payments from the National Health Service for agencyactivities carried out by chemists, opticians and medical appliance contractorsare to be excluded from control.   Their remuneration is already effectivelycontrolled by the Government.   The application of the control to the other
commercial activities of chemists, opticians and medical appliance contractorswill remain unchanged.   The reference to the exclusion from control of charges to the NHS by doctors and dentists has been transferred from paragraph 10j$of the present Code.Paragraph 6(xv): Payments by the Post Office to sub postmasters are to be excluded from control for the same reason, that remuneration is effectivelyunder public control.Paragraph 7,t     Sugar is deleted from the illustrative list of semi-processedfoodstuffs subject to control, because raw beet sugar is -exempted from control under the amendment to paragraph 8.Paragraph 8(ii)i    Raw beet sugar for further refining was exempitifrom pre-notification earlier this year and is now exempted from the Code controls.Paragraph 9 &apos;*    The amendment makes it clear that distributors&apos; margins on thesale of liquid milk are not controlled under the Code, because they areeffectively controlled under the powers to regulate milk prices.Paragraph 10;   The base levels for the price of milk for the manufacture of butter and skim milk powder are more precisely defined, and the premia used inthe calculation of the prices of milk for the manufacture of other products areto be increased by half of the difference between the present cash premia andthe premia which would have been produced by maintaining the premia in thesame percentage terms as applied in the year ending JO April 1973*   This will allow the Milk Marketing Boards more flexibility to deal with market distortions.Paragraph 1g:   The amendments are consequential on the changes to other partsof the Code.
Paragraph 17?    Enterprises which carry out more than one activity, iemanufacturing, service and distribution, will&quot;be required to treat each activity of their business separately for Code purposes, unless separate account^satisfying paragraph 14 of the Code cannot be made available for each of them.This is to ensure that, wherever possible, the activities of mixed enterprisesare subject to the Code rules most appropriate to them; difficulties have arisen in the past where it has been necessary, for example, to control the minority manufacturing activities of a distribution enterprise on the basis of gross percentage margins. &quot;Paragraph 18:    The amendment iB intended to make clear i that it isthe percentage, not the cash, increase in total costs which mayinot be exceededby the percentage increase in price.   Up change in practice is involved.Paragraph 19A:   Food subsidy payments under the Prices Act are to be treated ,by enterprises who receive them as part of their return from the market.   Thisreflects the fact that food subsidy payments are made to reduce or avoidprice increases under the Code which would otherwise be recovered from themarket.   The new provision applies only to enterprises which actually receivesubsidy payments and not to enterprises which sell subsidised foods at sub-sequent stages of distribution.Paragraph 20s   The method of calculation of price reductions is specified asbeing the mirror-image of the calculation of permitted price increases - thisis in line with the Price Commissions current practice.Paragraph 22i   The major change to the retrospective recovery rules is thatthe period of recoupment is shortened from 12 months to a minimum of 6 months.This takes account of the increased inflationary pressures since the presentintroducedCode was .   A      and of the effect of the 3-month rule in putting greater
emphasis on retrospective recoupment.   The drafting of the rules has also been changed to make clear that cost increases incurred before the date of theprevious price increase may be taken into account if they have not alreadybeen fully recovered in prices.Paragraph The three month rule is amended in three ways; firstly, theexemptions which are at present based on the proportion of &quot;raw1 materials(together with, fuel and power) in total costs are in future to be based on theproportion represented by all materials, fuel and power; secondly, the requirement that a product cannot be increased in price within 3 months of a price increase onrelated product is not to be retained; and thirdly enterprises are permitted to take 13 weeks rather than 3 months if that fits in better with theiraccounting period?. The 3-roonth rule will not apply to price increases underthe investment relief provision in paragraph 69A.Paragraph 27 i    A technical transitional provision.Paragraph 28;   Several minor additions are made to the list of allowable costs.They take account of representations received from industries which becauseof the nature of their business have a higher than average share of non-allowablecosts.   They also remove the element of discrimination against smaller firms which resulted from disallowing certain bought-in services which may be providedby directly-employed labour or equipment in larger firms.   In addition, editorialcontributions   are to be included in- the category of fully allowable costs.    the additions to the list of allowable costs will apply to cost increases firstincurred on or after 1 November 1974. The Government propose to amend the definition of allowable depreciation to specify more precisely the basis onwhich depreciation is to ba calculated for the purposes of the Code.    The.amendment makes it clear that an historic cost

The maindifferences are:-(a)   The safeguard will apply to a range of products or aervioes(or individualbasis should be used, but account may be taken of revaluation of assets which tookplace in accounts for financial years ending on or before 30 September 197?.In this context it is not the Government1 s current intention to--allow re-valuation within the life of the c ounter-inflation programme to enableprices to be increased.   The amplifications of &quot;generally accepted accountingprinciples&quot; under this paragraph applies also to paragraphs 58 (definition of net profit margin) and 63 (definition of capital).Paragraph 32:    The effect ofihhe proposals set out in paragraphs 11-12 ofPart I on different types of products or product ranges is illustrated inthe table below (rates rounded to the nearest whole number):      u
products or services where an enterprise has normally treated its productsindividually for the purpose of calculating its permitted price increases)rather than to the enterprise as a whole.(b) A firm will be able, for each product or range of products, toincrease its prices to the extent necessary, either to cover costs with two thirdsadditional  2% profit margin or to achieve a profit margin of A   of the margin on30 April 1973   (or of the margin on 30 September 1972 if between those two dates the profit margin fell by 25$ or more).(c) It will no longer be necessary to demonstrate that the erosion of profit has been caused solely by the operation of the Code.(d) The allowable costs provisions (paragraph 28 of the Code), the&apos;productivity deduction (paragraph 32) and the total cost constraint(paragraph 18) will all be overridden by the operation of the safeguard.However, once it has been invoked, the safeguard will be assumed to haveabsorbed all the available allowable cost increases for the product or service concerned.   Only any element for the new investment relief(paragraph 69A) will be regarded as additional to a permitted price increase under the safeguard provision.   As under the present Code, thenew safeguard may not be invoked by an enterprise which is exceeding, oris likely to exceed, its profit margin reference level.(e) The base date for the profit-erosion safeguard is to be a singledate, rather than a representative period, although the level of output for the calculation of the profit margin at that date should be based ona representative period as provided in paragraphs 2k and 25 of the Code.(f) In order to give the Price Commission adequate time to examineinitial applications for the use of this safeguard, any pre-notifying
SECRETfirm wishing to apply the new provision for the first time will berequired to give 56 rather than 28 days&apos; notice to the Commission.Paragraph *&amp;A:   The charging of a common price, calculated as a weightedaverage of individual permitted price increases, is to be allowed for enter-prises which are parties to common price agreements upheld by the restrictive practices Court.  This will enable the common price agreement for cement to bemaintained, in the light of the Court&apos;s decision in January this year reaffirmingits jsanction of this agreement.     Individual companies will not, however, be permitted to exceed their profit margin reference levels, and all the firms concerned will be subject to th9 pre-notifica^ion requirement.1&quot;:&apos;     ** The averaging of individualpermitted price increases will not include any price increase in respect of investment relief (paragraph 69A), as the relief does not relate to particularproducts, eg those within a common price agreement.Paragraph hSi   The period over which anticipation of known cost increasesmay be spread is reduced from a minimum of 6 months to a minimum of 3 months,and the period over which the new price must be quoted v/ithout further increase is similarly reduced.Paragraph k7s     In line with the change proposed to the 3-mpnth rule (paragraph26B) to remove the distinction between &quot;raw&apos; materials and pther materials,Ithe facility to anticipate estimated cost increases is extended from rawmaterials to any materials which fluctuate frequently and unpredictably in price.Paragraph A drafting change is proposed in order to make clear how the productivity deduction operates in variation-of-price clauses.Paragraph 30:     A drafting, amendment.Paragraph 32:   The present safeguard which applies to contracts has proveddifficult to operate primarily because it requires that the application of the
productivity deduction to a particular contract would cause an enterprise asa whole to fall below 90$ of its base profit margin.   A new form of safeguardis therefore proposed which still relates to the profit margin of* the enterpriseas a whole but which exempts variation-of-price clauses from the productivitytwo-thirdsdeduction whenever this profit margin falls below       of the reference level.Paragraph 56s    This paragraph has been absorbed into the revised paragraph 34.   ^Paragraph 59i   The sentence referring to reference levels under previous CodesIIis now redundant and has been deleted; this amendment also applies to paragraph 79iParagraph 65? Amendments are made to remove potential conflict between thisparagraph and paragraph 57* which provides that the reference period ends nolater than 30 April 1973.Paragraph 66A;     The new provision makes it clear that, as in the case of reconstruction or amalgamation of enterprises, acquisitions and disposals madeby companies which do not amount to reconstruction or amalgamation of enterprisesshould be taken into account in calculating profit margin reference levels and current profit margins; no money borrowed or interest paid In connection withan acqiisition should be included in the calculation.Paragraph 66B;     This removes an anomaly in the present Code, whereby theacquisition of a new company after 29 April 1973 appears to prevent anysub-division of the acquiring company for profit control purposes under. or low profit-makingparagraph 60 of the Code.   The incentive to turn round loss-making/(companiesis increased by providing that the losses of a company acquired after 29 April1973 no longer have to be taken into the profit margin reference level calculationbut may be replaced for the purposes of the calculation by the minimum returnavailable under paragraphs 68 or 69 of the Code.Paragraph 67;   Consequential on the new paragraphs 66A and 66B.
SECRET ,Fara^raph 6*8;    Bearing in mind the increased rate.of inflation since thefigure of 8$ was fixed as the minimum return on capital under the Code, buttaking account also of the substantial changes proposed for other provisionsof the Code (particularly the product-based safeguard in paragraph jM whichshould reduce the need for enterprises to have recourse to this safeguard, theGovernment propose to raise the minimum return on capital from % to   \Q%The definition of capital is amended as indicatedfin the commentary on paragraph 28,Paragraph 69:    Corresponding to the amendment to paragraph 68, the GovernmentI     -      * upropose to raise the minimum return on turnover, which may be substituted forthe minimum return on capital at the option of the enterprise, from 1^ to 2%.Paragraphs 6 A**^parate note on the details of the proposed investment reliefscheme is at Appendix 1.Paragraph 70s   Beneficiaries of investment relief under paragraph 69A are notdebarred from applying to the Commission for further relief under paragraph 70in special cases which satisfy the criteria in this paragraph, but the commission will be obliged to have regard to the amount of relief obtainable under paragraph 69A.Paragraph 71A:   ^ new Power is proposed for the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection to certify in relation to any product that, where a severe shortage of supply or serious threat of such shortage exists and threatensto cause significant damage to the interests of industry or consumers., price increases may take place up to a specified level irrespective of the allowable cost rules of the Code.   The certificate may also provide for the profit margincontrol to be overridden if necessary.I paragraph Ik:   Distribution enterprises which had completed less than a quarter&apos;strading by 30 April 1973 but which can produce separate accounts for a 12-month period ending not later than 31 March 1974 are to be brought within the control on gross percentage margins.     Distributors who are at present subject to control-on the basis of a single quarter&apos;s figures up to 30 April 1973 will thus be ableto establish gross margins on the basis of a year&apos;s results.Paragraph 7U3; ^ The distributors&apos; safeguard is amended to allow gross margins torice above 100/i - though not above 10.^5 - of the margin specified inq SECRET
paragraph 7^(i)i to allow net profit margins to reach 75% of net referencelevels.Paragraph 78.   This amendment is consequential on the changes made to the safeguards for manufacturers and service enterprises.   Any unit of a distributionenterprise which is treated separately under paragraphs 14 and 17 of the Codefor gross margin control purposes will be permitted, in addition to coveringits costs, to obtain a return of 2% on turnover, provided that the net profit margin reference level of the enterprise is not likely to be exceeded.Paragraph 79:    See paragraph 59.Paragraph 8?:   The effect of the changes is to replace the deficit containmentprovisions which apply to the nationalised industries with provisions broadly similar to the low-profit safeguards applying to the private sector, after allowing for the different way in which the nationalised industries are financed.They continue to be subject to the Ministerial powers of intervention inparagraph 85.Paragraph 83A:   This is a purely technical addition. sParagraph 84 and 84A:   The provision on multi-part tariffs has been clarifiedand takes account of fuel adjustment clause price increases.Paragraph 85?   The amendments here are consequential changes following revisionsto paragraph 83, but include provisions for a price increase justified in oneyear to be continued in later years.Paragraph 86A: These provisions have been made necessary by the reconstruction of the finances of British Rail following the passage of the Railways Act 197^*Paragraph 89: Local authority trading services are to remain subject to price &apos;control, but local authorities are to be given flexibility to Tfationalise their charges to take account of the local government re-organisation v/hich took effect in England and Wales -&apos; 10

Charges for parking on-street and in local authority car parks,with the exception of the short-stay charges, (less than   4 hours) which most affectregular shoppers   in off-street car parks, are to be freed from price control in order to assist authorities in1 dealing with traffic management problems.   Local authorities are no longer to be subject to profit margin control, which cannot be effectively applied to the relatively fewunsubsidised trading services.&apos;     Y   : :   - 0? &apos;   &apos; &apos;&apos; :&apos;:    &apos;    ; &apos;     0 fl: ,&quot;\    &apos; 00: ?. :&apos; &apos;&apos; .  ,;Paragraph 90s     In the light of re-organisation of the water industry inEngland and Wales as a result of the Water Act 1973* the new regional water authorities and statutory water undertakers are to be subject to the overridingrule of compliance with their statutory obligations, which may includedirections given by Ministers under the Water Act 1973.   The role of thePrice Commission will be to monitor that charges for water, sewerage and otherwater services do not exceed the level which is required to comply with thoseobligations.   Similar rules will apply to metered water charges in Scotland.Other charges for water services in Scotland and Northern Ireland are not subject to control as they are financed out of local or national taxation.     Movestowards the restructuring of charges are to be permitted within the overall limitsimposed by the Code.Paragraph 91:    Drafting amendments.Paragraph 93A*   Tax variation clauses in equipment leasing agreements providefor variations of rental upwards or downwards in response to tax changes, assuch changes can affect very substantially the balance Of the agreements.   these clauses are now to be allowed to operate when corporation tax is increased,provided that the return to the lessor on his capital expenditure becomesno greater than it would have been if the rate of tax had remained the same.Paragraph 99;     Consequential on the addition of paragraph 86A.Paragraph 103:     The control has applied in an anomalous manner to small trades-men, such as v/indow-cleaners and jobbing gardeners, and others whose totalrevenue is mostly used for the living expenses of themselves and their families.

The Government therefore propose to exempt from the Code self-employed persons whose business expenses do not exceed 1C$ of their    . . ^. .v   the reference to the remuneration of doctors and dentists has been transferredto paragraph 6(xiv).
SECTION II   - DRAFT OF A REVISED PT?Tffr nonn1. The Code has a dual function. First, the Price Commission arerequired to exercise their powers so as to ensure thai it is implemented.&apos;Secondly, al! those concerned with the determination of prices and charges should have regard to it2. The Code is therefore addressed both to the Commission and to all those concerned with price and charge determination.   i&apos;iGeneral Principles3. The general principles relating to prices are:  (i) to limit the extent to which prices may be increased on accountof increased costs, and to secure reductions as a result of reducedcosts;(ii) to reinforce the control of prices by a control on profit marginswhile safeguarding and encouraging investment;   .(iii) to reinforce the effects if competition, and to secure its fullbenefits in the general level of prices. ., ,Field of.Application4. With the exceptions specified in paragraphs 5 to 11 below, theprices of goods and services supplied to the United Kingdom home marketare within the scope of the control.5. The prices of goods and services exported (wheiner &quot;directly or&quot;through an agent or merchant) are not controlled.6.  The following are not controlled:-prices paid on first sale into the United Kingdom of imported goods and services;
(ii) prices of goods and services where the application of the con-trol would be inconsistent with an international agreement orarrangement. For this purpose, an international agreement orarrangement is one between states or organisations of states,not between firms;(Hi) prices at sales by auction, where such sales are a normal prac-tice in the particular trade;(iv) prices of goods at the point of sale on a commodity market inthe United Kingdom such as the London Metal Exchange orprices directly determined by reference to such markets;(v) prices of second-hand goods (other than second-hand roadvehicles sold by distributors);(vi) charges for the carriage of goods or passengers on internationaljourneys; charges for air navigation, landing and related scr-vices and ship, passenger and goods dues, provided that they relate wholly or mainly to such traffic; charges for internationalmail. Giro, remittance and telecommunication services;(vii) prices of ethical medicines supplied to 1 the United kingdom market to the extent that regulation of their prices is withinthe scope of any agreement relating to those prices&apos; made between the Secretary of State for Social Services and representatives--sentatives of manufacturers of those medicines; but only solong as such an agreement is in force;(viii) prices inOovermient contracts for Warlike andother stores ana services which are within the agreement-between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and industry governing the pricing of, and control of profit from, non-competitivecontracts. These prices will be subject to the controls provided in that agreement;(ix) insurance premiums, which a/K subject to restriction by theSecretary of State for Trade; &quot;   &quot; i(x) taxi fares, where subject to control by the Home Secretary orthe Secretary of State for Scotland;(xi) charges payable to returning officers in connection with Parlia-mentary elections, determined under the Representation of thePeople Act 1949;(xii) prices determined by a statutory body which, as a result ofan order made under section 8 of the Counter-Inflation Act1973, is required to apply the Code to the determination ofthose prices;(xiii) subscriptions and certain prices charged by non-profit-makingorganisations as in paragraphs 107 to 109,&apos;(xiv) charges for services to the National Health Service by doctors,- rtonfcdispensing pharmacists, dispensing and opththalmic opticiansand medical appliance contractors;(xv) charges for services to the Post Office by. sub-postmasters.A pplication to food, farming and forestry products7. The prices of manufactured food and drink, like those of manu-factured products generally, are within the scope of the control as arethose of semi processed foodstuffs such as butter, cheese and quick-frozen vegetables.8(0 The prices paid to United Kingdom producers or producers&apos; organisa-tions or to overseas suppliers for fresh foods and similar products, whichare subject to fluctuations on world and United Kingdom markets becauseof seasonal factors or changes in the relationship between supply and demand, are not controlled. This applies in particular to meat,, includingbacon and coultry, &quot;sh, eggs, fesit and vegetables. However &quot;enterpriseswhich resell tli??e piexlucts, whether home-produced or imported,- at any subsequent stage will he subject to control.(ii) 1&apos;ho prico -for the sale of r-wr boet su/pr- for further .rofining is not controlled.
SEC! !vE i09. the retail price of milk for liquid consumption and the margins of milk distributors will continue to be subject to the existing controlsby the minister of agriculture, fisheries and-&apos;food and-the secretary of   -state for scotland.     so long as these controls apply, the price of milk for liquid consumption and distributors&apos; margins on milk fof liquidconsumption will not be subject to the code.10. the prices for milk for manufacture of products ror ,sale.in the united kingdom will, however, be subject tothe following requirements.     except where a ililk mark-meeting board incurs additional allowable cost increases in markeu ing milk:- . 11(i) the price for the sale of milk for th^manu-facture of butter and skimmed milk powder maynot be increased above the level prevailing at50 april 1973 (adjusted as necessary to reflect laterchanges in the intervention prices); and(ii) the price for the sale of milk for the manu-facture of other products may not be increasedaboy9 the sun of the maximum price permissible under sub-paragraph(i) above and half the sum of;-(a) the average premium received by theboard in respect of the product concerned in the year ending 3Q april 1973.9y.3il? price of &apos;.     milk; and(bj an amount found by applying to themaximum pricn permissible  &quot; under subparagraph .(i)above the percentage which the average pre-rnium&quot; referred to in&quot;&quot;(a) above bears to theprice of milk;beingr&quot;in either case the price of the milk forthe&quot;manufacture of butter and skimmed milk pow-..der in the year ending 30 april 1973*11.  what is said in paragraph 8rtin relation to prices paid for freshfoods applies also to prices of other primary products of animal or vegetableorigin which are subject to similar fluctuations.Charges12. references in the code to prices include references to charges, unless there is explicit provision to the contrary.Goods and services13. references in the code to goods or products include references to services, unless there is explicit provision to the contrary.Definition 0? enterprise14. with the exceptions described in paragraph 15, for the purposesof the code an enterprise means either an enterprise as a whole or a separateconstituent company or sub-division provided that in the latter case separateaccounts for such sub-divisions:  (i) arc or can be made available for all relevant periods;(ii) arc not materially distorted by transactions conducted other-wise than on arnfs length terms;(iii) would, if combined with one another and with the accounts of all other activities or transactions of the enterprise&apos;, produce\   result&apos;; consistent with those shown by the accounts of the enterprise taken as a whole.
15.  The definition la paragraph 14 docs not apply where tin: unit fornet profit margin control, as defined in paragraphs 60 and 61, is the relc-vant one. Accordingly, the definition in paragraph 14 docs not apply in para-graphs 52., 57 to 69,.dSW^l%nd 715 or, where they deal withnet profit margins, in paragraphs 20, ^t, khA, 70* 7.1 A,78 and 795 or in other paragraphs which refer to these.16. A reference to an enterprise includes a reference to a co-operative,a partnership or to an individual carrying on a business.Mixed enterprises17.  Where the activities of an enterprise are not confined to manu-facturing, distribution, or the provision of services, but include more iharr-one of these, each of these activitiesmusfcbe treated separately for     thppurposes of allowable cost increases and rross percentagemargina unless separate accounts satisfying paragraph 14cannot be made available for each of thern.     if/here these activities are not treated separately, the main activity of the enterprise will determine whether the provisionsof the Code relating to manufacturing, distribution or services apply.Costs and Prices18.   Prices which are within the control may not be increased unless .there is an increase in total costs per unit of output. ITo pricemay be increased by a greater percentage than the per-centage increase in total costs, per, unit of output.19. Where there is an increase in total costs per unit, only thoseincreases defined in the Code as &quot;allowable cost increases&quot; may be takeninto account in arriving at the permitted price increase, and they will besubject to a productivity deduction where appropriate.19A. An enterprise which receives a subsidy on any food under &apos;section 1 of the Prices Act 1974 must treat the subsidy as nart of-thQ.PriG3 it receives for that food or for any product in which that food is an in^redignt.Price reductions n^0.   Prices should be reduced whenever possible. V/horethere is a net reduction in allowable costs per unit of output, prices should be reduced by an amount equal to; .any percentage reduction in allowable costs calculated in a similar manner to -that prescribed for calculation of permitted price increases under, paragraph 23..Reductions arc however nofrcquired to exceed the percentagetall in total costs per unit of output. In addition prices should 06 reducedas required in paragraphs 59 and 79 where, in the case of a distributor,its gross percentage margin, and in the case of any enterprise, its profit margin reference level is exceeded, or is likely to be exceeded.Base date21. The starting point for the calculation of perm it led price increasesis the level of costs per unit of output at 30 April 1973. In calculating pcr-mittcd price increases, cost increases first incurred after 30 April 1973may be taken into account, to the extent that they have not already been reflected in prices. Where the price of a particular product or of a range of related products has not been increased since 30 September 1972, that(late may, at the option of tiie enterprise, be substituted for 30 April 1973 inparagraphs 23 and 28 below. However, except as in paragraph 22, the permitted price increase may not include any element of retrospectiverecovery of costs incurred before the date on which, the price increaseitikes effect.
22,    A permitted price increase may include recovery infash terms Of cost   increases first incurred between JOIpril 1973 and the date of the permitted price increase,fprovided that :-(i) the amount included for such costs is such asto recover the costs over a period of not les3than 5 months beginning with the date of imply-ementation of the permitted price increase;(ii) the costs were allowable cost increases under the provisions ofthe Code in force at the time they were incurred; and(iii) in the calculation of any subsequent price increase under the code, the &quot; selling price&quot; referred to in paragraph 23(iii)should exclude any element which represents a recovery ofi       costs under this paragraph. !iThe nremitted price increase may take full account of cost increases which have notib?cn fully reooyered before the d-tg nf  He. p^ine. -ir^-^AND.     .Wncre the permmea oasc uate is 30 September VJI&apos;L, cost increases firstincurred after that date may be taken into account in determining the permitted price increase, but retrospective recovery of such cost increasesmust be limited to costs incurred in the period between 30 April 1973 andthe date of the price increase. A price increase which includes an element&apos;of recovery of costs under this paragraph may exceed the increase in total costs per unit by the amount necessary to permit the recovery of those costs.Calculation of Permitted Price Increase23. The maximum permitted price increase should be arrived at asfollows:  (i) calculate the change in total costs per unit and allowable cost &apos;increases per unit (as reduced by the productivity deduction)between the base date and the date of the price increase; cost increases which have already been reflected in prices shouldbe excluded;(ii) express allowable cost increases per unit as a percentage oftotal costs per unit at the base date;(iii) apply the resulting percentage to the selling price at the basedate in order to establish the new permitted price level.In (i), (ii) and (iii) above, &quot;base date&quot; means 30 April 1973, or at the option of the enterprise, the date of any subsequent price increase.24. The calculation of the level of costs per unit referred to in para-graph 23(5) should be based on the levels of pay and other costs rulingat the base date and on the level of output over the most recent repre-sentativc period completed by that elate (eg the previous quarter) forwhich adequate&apos; records are available. Similarly the calculation of costs per unit at the dale of the price increase may take account, in accordancewith the normal practice of the enterprise, of increases in raw material prices and other allowable cost increases up to the date of the price increase and should reflect the output level achieved in the most recent representa-tive period (eg the quarter preceding the date of the price increase).25. The level:; of unit costs calculated in this v/ay will not necessarilybo the same as the average figures recorded for the whole of the periodchosen, eg if pay or other costs changed during the period. If output inthe period was materially affected by abnormal factors such as holidays,an appropriate adjustment should be made. If this is impossible, theprevious normal operating period should be chosen with appropriate adjust-metis to allow for changes in the level of pay 00 other costs.
26. Where price increases are being made not on a single product buton n range of related products (under paragraphs 42 or 43) the procedure in paragraphs 23 to 25 still applies. But in this case the group of related products should be considered as a single product; the costs per unit can .be expressed either as costs per unit of volume of output or if a volume..,measure is impracticable as costs per   of sales value. Where the calculatedpermitted percentage price increase is not applied uniformly to the whole range of products, the weighted average percentage price increase made onthe selling prices of the products within the group may not exceed this,percentage,26A (i) Where after 25 March 1974 an indirect tax has been increased,m addition not exceeding the cash amount of the increase borne by the vendor may be made to the prices permitted by other provisions of the-.Code for goods bearing the increased tax. Where an indirect tax is reduced the reduction must be fully reflected in prices. i,(ii) This paragraph applies also to the effects of changes in the coverageof indirect taxes.(iii) In calculating maximum permitted price increases after 25 Marc! -. .1974, the figures for total costs per unit and the selling price at the basedate must exclude any additions or reductions under this paragraph.(iv) VAT is not regarded as part of the price for calculating prices and price increases for manufacturing and service enterprises, and this paragraphdoes not affect the treatment of VAT for this purpose.&apos; Frequency of price increases26B. A price to which the provisions on allowable cost increases npply majnot be increased within 3 monthszov, at the Option of the enter-  &apos;- nrise, within&apos;i 3 weeks of its last increase, unless:-1(i) the price increase permitted by the Code is ai least 10 per cent; or :.(ii) the costs of    - materials, fuel and power in the product account for at &quot;jleast 75 per cent of total costs at the time of the price increase; or \ I(iii) the price increase permittee! by the Code is at least 5 per cent and the costs; ; - -of..   materials, fuel and power account for at least 50 per cent of total costs at the time of the price increase; or ; &apos;(iv) the price increase is permitted under paragraph 34 (profit margin safeguard). ..the second sentence of paragraph 53 (special offers^ paragraphs,    63 or 69     N( low profit.:.) or paragraphs..o^As&quot; 70 or..ll..,(.inyestment) applyL26C. In applying paragraph 26B price increases under paragraph 26A attri- Ibutable solely to increases in indirect taxes should be disregarded.&apos; ITransitional Provisions \27. &quot;/here an increase in a price or charge was implemented whilethe Code&apos; set out&apos; in the Counter-Inflation (price and Pay Code)Order 1973 or the Code 3et out.in the Counter-Inflation (price and Pay Code) (No.2) Order 1973 as amended v/as in force and wasnot perriijss&amp;bla un&apos;.&apos;.&apos;or wnicHayar or&apos; those Codes waa for the, timebeing in force, the price or charge in question should bereduced to the level that would have been permitted under theappropriate Code and this lower price should then be taken as&apos;the &quot;selling price at the base date&quot; in calculating any price increase permitted under paragraph 23 of this Code on accountof subsequent cost increases.
,UlovrabIe Cost increases28. Subject to the following paragraphs, a cost increase may be regarded3S an allowable cost increase for the purpose of paragraph 19 if:  (i) it was first incurred after 30 April 1973; and(ii) it was incurred for one of the following:  (a) labour;(b) materials, components, consumable stores and supplies, fuel and power;(c) rent of nremises, rates, payment for licencesover or in respect ui land;(d) interest charges, as defined in paragraph 31*and depreciation, calculcated in accordancewith generally accepted accounting principlesconsistently applied by the enterprise con-cerned, but based on the historic cost of the iassets except that   where,in annual accounts for a year ended on or before 3,0 September1972* the enterprise has revalued an asset       J,the value may be based on the value of the i^- .asset shown in thosei accounts;(e) certain bought-in services, not of a capitalnature, that is: transport, hire of equip-ment, insurance, storage, postage,mainten-ance, telephone and engineering services,research and development, security services,,computer services, editorial contributions!_____(f) commission processing and other sub-contracted;operations on materials or components incor-porated into the product;(g) fees for professional services, payments bythe Posti Office to sub-postmasters;(h) royalties; and(iii) it has not already been reflected in prices.Ms paragraph does not apply to costs increases if they:ere first incurred on the following before 1 Novemberpayment for licences over and in respect of land;bought-in research and development, computer ser-vices, security service&apos;s&apos;^Veditorial contributions^and items referred to in sub-paragraphs (g)arOl(h)TInterest charges31. Increases in interest charges payable by an enterprise are allowable cost increases, unless the charges or the increases in. them:  (i) represent a distribution of profits rather than a true interestcharge; or(ii) where they arise on loans between related undertakings, relate,to loans which are not strictly required for the business orrepresent interest in excess of that which would be charged ina transaction at arm&apos;s length; or(iii) represent interest which would properly be regarded as capitalexpenditure in the period in which it is incurred.
Productivity Deduction32(i) In order to ensure that the benefits&apos; of increased productivity are passed on to theconsumer, a deduction should be made fromallowable cost increases.   Enterprises arerequired to absorb   2p% of allowable cost increases arising from increases in labour costs (excluding the labour costs listed inparagraph 33) except that:(fk)     where the share of labour costs in total costs exceeds 35$ IIenterprises are required to absorban amount equal to the percentageof total costs which would apply iflabour costs represented 35$ of total costs;(fa.)   where the share of labour costs in total costs is lesii than 1     enterprises arerequired to absorb an amount equal to thepercentage of total costs which would---I IBM .    .     . -I .

The deduction for productivity under paragraph 32 need not beapplied to increases in or arising from:-(i) employers&apos; national insurance contributions;(ii) training costs;(iii) the cost of improvements in respect of progress towards the achievement of the requirements of the Equal Pay Act 1970,\(iy) the cost of improvements to meet the purposes of section 8 of the.Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959, . the, Road11 Haulage Wages Act 1938 , and similar legislation, and the FairWages Resolution of 1946;(v) new or improved benefits under occupational pension or death, benefit schemes which, arc tax approved, or underncomparablc1  schemes not requiring l?x approval, -e.r.y deficiency nav-&quot;aents to such schemest and any reimbursement of a.corresponding increase :n employee contributions.

. SECRETAllocation of costs to controlled prices35. Allocation of costs to particular controlled goods or services for the calculation of allowable cost increases or increases in total costs may benecessary where an enterprise:  (i) sells in both home and overseas markets; or(ii) makes sales at home, some of which are within and someoutside the scope of the control; or(iii) makes sales of different products or groups of products whichare within the control, and has to divide costs between themfor the purposes of the CodeWhere such an enterprise:  (a) has made allocations which represent a fair division of costs inits circumstances, over part cr all of the field; and(b) has don? so on a consistent basis,it should continue to use this basis for all calculations relevant to [the Code.In other cases enterprises may make such allocations by dividing costs in proportion to the value cf sales in each area, or on any other basis which represents good accounting practice, provided that it adheres to the chosenbaris for all calculations relevant to the Code.Stocks36. In calculating the cost of current production or soles, enterprises may.need to include an element for stocks of raw materials, of components orof finished goods, used for production or sales. When making suchcalculations in order to arrive at costs per unit of output and at anyallowable cost increases, enterprises should adhere to the practice they have followed consistently for the treatment of such costs for pricing purposes.Transfer prices37. Where the Commission arc satisfied that prices, either of purchasesor of sales, which an enterprise proposes to regard as a basis for the calcula-tion of allowable cost increases or of net profit margins, differ from whatthey would be if the goods or services had been transferred on an arm&apos;slengih basis, they may substitute modified cost increases or profit marginswhich in their judgement fairly reflect what would be appropriate on that basis.Costs of sectors including small enterprises38.  Where the Commission are satisfied that:  (i) significant reductions or increases in allowable costs have occurred or are about to occur in a sector of industry, or com-merce which includes a considerable number of small enterprises,especially those providing services; and(ii) the information available to them indicates that these changesin costs are likely to be of broadly the same order for a sub-stantial number of such enterprises, in respect either of some or all of the goods or services which they supply,the Commission, after consulting any body or persons which they regard as representative of enterprises affected and after taking into account infor-mation supplied by them, may calculate average allowable cost increases orreductions for the relevant goods or services. In the case of cost increases,these increases should then be taken as the allowable cost increases for the relevant goods or services; in the case of cost reductions, the commission may specify reductions under paragraph 20 in the prices of the relevantgoods or services which should then be made by all the enterprises concerned.39. In calculating average allowable cost changes under paragraph 38 theCommission will take account of:  (i) all relevant information available to them on cost changes forthe goods or services concerned, including information supplied by any trade association or other body which they consider isrepresentative of the enterprises concerned; and(is) any other relevant provisions of the tSeifcp CT
40. The Commission will publish information about any average allowable cost chances which they have determined under paragraphs &quot;38 and 39together with an indication of any price changes which thev regard as justifiedor required under the Code on the basis of those average allowable costchanges.41. V/hcre the allowable cost changes of a particular enterprise differ from those published by the Commission under paragraph 40, that enterprisemay apply the normal provisions of the Code relating to allowable cost increases or price reductions, It will be -the responsibility of the enterpriseto satisfy the Commission if required that this was justified.Product Costs and Allowable Cost Increases.Single product  enterprises42. Where an enterprise makes a single product or a single range of products die calculations required, by the Code may be carried out by reference to the costs and prices of that enterprise as a whole.Multi-product enterprises: related products43.  This paragraph applies to enterprises making a variety of products...Where:-(i) allowable cost increases arise on one or more of a range of related products; and(ii) a price increase in respect of them is permissible under the Code,the enterprise need not relate the price increase for individualproducts within the ranee closely to the cost increase for eachproduct, provided(a) it has been established practice to treat the range of products in this way; and(/)) the average increase in price, weighted by the value of sales in a recent period, will not exceed the sum of what the Codewould permit on the products affected by the cost increases.44.  In cases not covered by paragraphs 42 and 43 the calculationsrequired by the Code should be made by reference to individual products.Common Pricing Agreements upheld by the restrictive practices CourthhA.

Anticipation of cost increases45. Prices may net be increased in anticipation of cost increases, except as described in paragraphs 46 to 48. However:  (i) an enterprise may determine and announce a price increaseconsistent with the Code which takes account o!; future&apos;allowable cost increases which are already known as to both date and amount, provided that the price increase is not implementedbefore the allowable cost increases are incurred; and(ii) an enterprise required to pre-hotvfy an intended price increase lo;i   the Commission may se.;-.k the agreement of the Commission to aprice increase consistent with the Code which takes account ofsuch known future cost increases, subject to the same proviso asin (i).&apos;&apos; &apos; &quot;\ &apos; ./ /46. Where: (i) a future allowable cost increase is already known, as to both date and amount; and(ii) it is proposed to quote a price for supply on demand which willnot be increased for at least 3 months from the date on whichit takes effect, s &apos;&quot;&quot;   *an enterprise may average the future allowable&apos;cost increase over the periodof not less than 3, months for which it quotes the price in arriving at a price increase for that period, provided that: (a) the total amount raised will not be increased by the averaging;and(b) the averaging is in accordance with a well-established practice inthe trade concerned.47. Paragraph 46(i) may be read as applying to an estimated future cost increase if:  &apos;(i) it relates to a       material which fluctuates frequently and un-predictably in price; and(ii) the use of estimates of such cost increases is a well-established practice of the trade; and(iii) in framing the estimates the enterprise adheres to the methodsit has consistently used for the treatment of such costs for pricingpurposes.48. This paragraph applies to tenders to the extent that they are at fixed prices. In framing such tenders, those concerned should have regard to the code, but where tenders are the custom of the trade(i) competitive tenders may provide for estimated future cost increases,(ii) non-competitive tenders may provide for estimated future cost increases if the contract is to run for at least six months fromthe date ou which work is to begin./
Escalation and variation of price clauses49. Price increases made under an escalation or variation of price clausemay reflect cost increases for items listed in paragraph 23(ii), x. ^to the extent that this is permitted under the contract,and the productivity deduction specified in paragraph- &quot;52, is applied to anylabour cost increase incurred..&quot;&quot;&quot; iMiTtlie^application oi ti:e prouiictsvny deduction causes or increases a loss on aparticular contract, taken as a whole, the terms of the escalation or variation of price clauses may be applied to the extent necessary to avoid the loss,or flic increase in it. In addition to new contracts, this paragraph applies to existing contracts and to increases in prices under those contracts, to theextent that ihey relate to cost increases after 6 November 1972.49A. Price increases under an escalation cr variation of price clause shouldbe taKiT. into account in applying paragraph 26B only if they are prc-notiflablito the Commission under an order under section 5 of the Counter-Inflation Ac1973. .Prime cost and cost reimbursement contracts50. Where a claim for payment by a contractor under any form of primecost or cost reimbursement arrangement includes.an element for increasedlabour cost levels since the start of the eoMruct or since 6 November 1972,whichever is the later, the productivity deductionspecified in paragraph 32 must be applied.   But if the     .......application of the _    productivity deduction causes or increases a loss on a particular contract, taken as a whole, the terms of the contract may beapplied to the extent necessary to avoid the loss, or the increase in it. ThisParagraph applies to new and existing contracts.51. Paragraph 50 does not apply where the terms of a prime cost or costreimbursement arrangement ensure that the benefit of economies in the use oflabour pass directly to the client. For non-competitive contracts of this typeplaced after 1 November 1973 the contractor may not quote a rate of feewhich is higher than that which he has charged since 30 April 1973 for thesame service or a similar one.....................52. V/hgrp, in the case of a contract to which paragraph :h9applies,,, ths net nrofit margin (^-eluding the amm^^nf^iviy &apos;foorgase in the reference level permitted underparagraph69 4 J. .,pf,ths^unit for nrofit margirTg control &quot;as defined &quot;in ^paragraphs 50 and 6*1 is more thvn one-third_bo low theroforonce level, the Productivity deduction need not Jibappj^edfor so long as the net profit margin remains below -this, figure. .     t &apos;      &apos; -&apos;Discounts and rebates ;53. The withdrawal or reduction of a discount or rebate, including a discount or rebate to a particular customer, is equivalent for the purposesof the Code to an increase in the price. This docs not apply, however,&apos; to a discount or rebate directly related to the promotion of one or moreproducts or services for a limited period or in a limited area.Quantity or quality change and new products54. A change in the quantity or quality of goods is equivalent for thepurposes of tho Code to a change in the price. Quality change in goods or services, quantity change in sales units, or artificial creation of new productsshould not be used as a means of avoiding the requirements of the Code.Where the Commission form the opinion that \\m has been done, they may seek price reductions, or disallow or reduce price increases.55. However, where a new product is marketed o:i an experimental andrestricted Imis for a period of not more than twelve months, the pricecharged, by die mmmfaclurer heed not be treated for die purposes of theCocie as establishing a pric;: for the product.
Prices and Profit Margins57. Prices should be determined so as to secure that net profit margins,as defined in paragraph 58, do not exceed the average level of the best twoof the last live years of account of the unit to which net profit margincontrol applies ending not later than 30 April 1973.(the,&quot; reference level&quot;),58. &quot; Net profit margin &quot; means the margin of net profit expressed as a percentage of sales or turnover. &quot; Net profit&quot; means the net profit, detcr-mincd in accordance with generally accepted accounting principlesconsistently applied by the enterprise concerned, which arises from trading operations within the control after taking into account all expenses of conducting and financing them, including depreciation and jintcrest as defined in paragraphs 28 and 31, but before deducting corporation tax orincome tax. .  ,Action where profit margin is likely to be exceeded59.  Where:-(i) the reference level has been exceeded; or(ii) in the light of interim accounts or other evidence, is likely tobe exceeded,abatements in allowable cost increases or price reductions should be made;provided that in either case account has been taken of seasonal and otherdistorting factors. The abatements or reductions should be sufficient to eliminate the actual or expected excess over the reference level as soonas reasonably possible, and to offset any excess which has already arisen in a period subsequent to 30 April 1973. ...Unit for profit margins ...60. In calculating the net profit margin under paragraph 57, the unitfor profit margin control shall be cither:  :&apos;(i) the enterprise as a whole; or : &apos;(ii) an activity treated separately under paragraph 17; or(iii) a unit of an enterprise, being a separate constituent cornpony orsubdivision, provided that the Commission are satisfied that:(a) the unit constituted, before 30 April 1973, and still con-stitutes, a separate unit immediately below the level of themain Board of the enterprise as a whole for management,operational and accounting purposes. In applying the testin this sub-paragraph the Commission may disregard an intermediate non-trading company; and(b) the accounts of all such units, if combined with one another,can be reconciled with those of the enterprise as a whole;and are not materially distorted by transactions conductedotherwise than on arm&apos;s length terms.The same unit should then be adhered to for all the purposes of the Codeto which the net profit margin is relevant.61. For the purpose of paragraph 60, where the enterprise is a company,&quot; the enterprise as a whole &quot; means the company or (where the company isa member of a group) all the companies in the group, but includes onlymembers of the group carrying on business in the United Kingdom; and inthis paragraph:  (i) company &quot; includes any body corporate; and(ii) &quot;group&quot; means the person (including a company) havingcontrol of a company together with all companies directly or indirectly controlled by him. *A llocation of profits to controlled prices62. Allocation of profits between prices within the control and thosewhich arc not may be necessary for the calculation of net profit margins.The requirements of paragraph 35 apply to such allocations of profits as theydo to allocations of costs. rcrnCT
Profit margins and indirect taxes63. In making comparisons between net profit margins as a percentageof sales and the reference level, due account must be taken of the effect onmargins of changes in indirect tax on goods and services sold, so that the comparison is not materially distorted. The comparison with earlier years should be made on a basis which excludes purchase tax from sales in theperiod up to the end of March 1973 and excludes VAT from 1 April 1973oawa;-ds. Where customs and excise duties have been included in the sales .figures, these duties should be included throughout, adjusted as necessary to&quot;. take account of the partial replacement of excise duties by VAT   &quot;*and of other changes in those duties.   Where indirect taxes have been increased after 25 March 1974, a deduction should be made from the valueof sales corresponding to the cash value of the extra tax borne by theeoods sold: conversely, where indirect taxes have been reduced after; 25 March 1974, a corresponding addition should be made to the value of&apos; sales. . . . &quot;   . ,i64. Where an enterprise does not already have accounts showing&apos;separately the purchase tax element in the turnover of previous years, or which permit the precise calculation of the amount of excise duty abatementfrom records of duty paid, such elements should be estimated on the basis ofthe best available information. Where total purchase tax can be ascertained from purchase invoices this total can be deducted from tax inclusive sales.Where such purchase invoices are not available, the purchase tax elementmay be estimated by applying to the value of purchases of goods charged to different rates of purchase tax appropriate factors derived from those rates.Modified base period for profit margin calculation65.. V/here an enterprise has traded for less than five com-plste years of account uo to 30 April 1973; or has tradedat a loss in one or more of those years, the reference level for paragraph 57 may be calculated as follows:-(i) if there have been four years of trading up to 3,1,October 1973? the average of the best two;-ifthree or two years, the best year;(ii) if there have been less than two years of trad-ing up to 31 October 1973? the limitation on pro-fit margins will not apply;(iii) any year in which an enterprise made a loss may be treated as equivalent to a year of no trading and sub-paragraphs (i) and(ii) may be applied accordingly^66. For a new enterprise formed from a reconstruction or amalgamation of existing enterprises the reference level will be calculated as defined inparagraph 57 by using the aggregate net trading profits of the constituententerprises expressed as a percentage of their aggregate sales. The same principles may be applied to an amalgamation of partnerships.

66A. Where the membership of a group of companies changes by the acquisition of a new member company or the disposal of an existing member company, then, in calculating net profit margins and reference levels in relation to the group and its members after the acquisition or disposal, the sales and profits of the member acquired (before and after the acquisition) shall be included and the sales and profits of the member disposed of (before and after the disposal) shall be excluded, and no account shall be taken in the case of an acquisition of money borrowed or interest paid in connection with the acquisition.

66B. (i) Where the membership of a group of companies changes by the acquisition of a new member company after 29 April 1973:-

(a) the words "constituted, before 30 April 1973, and still" in paragraph 60(iii) will not apply in relation to the new member company; and(b) the new member company may be integrated into a unit for profit margin control which has been or could have been established under paragraph 60(i), (ii) or (iii), so long as the conditions of paragraph 60(ii) or (iii) continue to be met where applicable.

(ii) If the new member company is integrated into such a unit:-

(a) the reference level of the unit will be calculated for the purposes of paragraph 57 by using the aggregate net trading profits of the new member and of the remainder of the unit expressed as a percentage of their aggregate sales: and

(b) if paragraph 68 or 69 was applicable to the new member company before the integration, the new member company&apos;s contribution to the unit&apos;s reference level may be calculated as if paragraph 68 or 69 still applied.

(iii) In calculating the net profit margin or the reference level of the new member company or of such a unit, no account shall be taker of money borrowed or interest ? in connection with the acquisition of the new member company.

(iv) This paragraph will not apply unless:-

(a) the acquisition of the new member company is the result of a transaction at arm&apos;s length; and

(b) the new member company existed outside the group be ore the transaction.


67. Where the Commission are satisfied that the reference, level of an enterprise, calculated as in paragraphs 57-61,^^ ^^^^/^&quot;re^uires modifi-cation. for example because of(i) a substantial reconstruction of the enterprise during, the baseperiod; or(ii) a substantial change in the character of the business; or(iii) a substantial change in the ratio between the value of net fixed assets (other than land and buildings) and the value of sales,arising from investment which has enabled the enterprise either(a) to undertake an earlier stage of production of goods or services; or(b) to achieve substantial savings in labour costs per unit of output,they may permit some departure from that reference level. In deciding whether, and to what extent, to permit such a departure the commission should have regard, as appropriate, to the principles referred to in paragraph66 and, for example, to the profit history of the main parts of the business which now make up the enterprise; the profits of any -substantial parts ofthe business acquired or added to the enterprise during the base period,excluding any such parts which have been disposed of or discontinued; diechange in the relative importance of different elements of the business;the extent of the change in the ratio between the value of net fixed assets and sales referred to in sub-paragraph (iii).Relief for low profits68.   v;here the Commission are satisfied that the net- profit margin calculated as described in :. c.r;.i-;.r;-.phs^7--&apos;&quot;&apos;-M&apos;-^j 6 L&amp;. cr        represents a return on capital of less than 12   per cent, trio restrictions on   -price increases and. on gross percentage   and. net profit margins   shall not be applied so as to restrict thereturn below IQ &apos; oer cent.   In such cases the net profit margin which would be needed to produce a return of ^ 10   per cent on capital may be treated as the reference level.   Yfliere in the earlier of the two bestyears referred to in paragraph 57 the net profit marginrepresented a return   on capital of less than 10per cent, a figure equivalent to a 10   per cent rateof return may be used for that year in calculating the reference level.    &quot;Capital&quot; means the net assets employedexcluding any part of them which is represented byborrowings the interest on which is deducted in arriving at uez profit as defined in paragraph 5,-3.,   The value of the assets concerned shall be determined, in accordance withgen orally&quot; accented acentntiru-; rxrinciole a consistentlyallied ij/,,.the enterprise mrt ^should he bused on the historic&apos; costs of the assets except that   vmerejin annualaccounts for a your ended onjxr before .50 September 19,72^the enterprise has ruvalue;t an asset   zhc value may bebased on tiio value, of the assent ^shown in11hose accounts.69. At the option of the enterprise paragraph 68 maybe read as referring to a net profit margin of j    percent on turnover rather than a; 10   per &quot;centreturn on capital..

70. Where the Commission arc satisfied that in a particular case it isnecessary in order to encourage or ensure investment to modify the applica-tion of the provisions relating to allowable cost increases or to increases in total costs or to profit margins, they may permit some modification of anyof those pievijlions^ j\in deciding whether, and to whal y^LwnL, Lo permit sucha departure the Commission should have regard to the following criteria:-(i) whether there is satisfactory evidence that if this is done expen-diture on the investment will begin within 12 months of the dateof the price being increased or the profit margin limit beingmodified; and(ii) whether(w) the application of the limits would deprive the enterprise of funds&quot; essential for investment which it could not reasonably be expected, or would not be able, to raise in some other way, or would reduce the prospective rate of return on the    *investment to a level which would deter the enterprise fromundertaking it; or(b) there is satisfactory evidence that the enterprise had absorbedcost increases to an exceptional degree a;, a result of voluntaryprice restraint and in consequence had significantly reducedprofit margins in the 12 mouths en/ling 30 September 1972* o^A\ni,; tne extent to which prices, grusa ^arutfiiooso-nargms and net profit margin reference levelsare modified by the application of paragraph 69A*71.  Where the Commission are satisfied that:-- &quot;  &quot;.    &apos;&quot;&quot;(i) an enterprise as defined in paragraphs (50 and 61 has nettangible fixed assets, excluding land and buildings, per.employeeWhich exceed  2,000 per head; and(ii) has a plant or gipup of plants and facilities, employed in themanufacture of a group of related - prod nets, which had a fixedasset value at original cost of at least 110m; arid(iii) that the capacity of this plant or group of plants was seriouslyunder-used over the most recent representative period before 30September 1972 or before the base date, as defined in paragraphs r21 and 23; and                                                   &quot;                   CL(iv) that the rate of utilisation has since risen by 121 percentage^ points;the Commission may, on application from die enterprise, modify the calcrria-tion of allowable and total costs per unit at the base date by substitutingthe figures for unit costs that, in the Commissions view, would have replied,at that time if the plant had been operating at the average rate of capacityuse which applied over the most recent representative period before the dateof the application. Where, however, an enterprise has already receivedapproval under this paragraph for a price increase after 1 November 1973,the date of that price increase shall be substituted for 30 September 1972*or the base date in sub-paragraph (iii).Shortage of Supplies &apos;&apos; &apos; 171A..........where, haying regard to the need to alleviate the shortage or threatened shortage referred to below, the Secretary of State hascert iffed in relation to any product or commodity that:-(i) there is a,seyere^hpjd^g^oflsupplies in the domestic market.....or. serious threat of such shortage,&apos; and__.(ii.)...... . significant damage is being thereby caused or threatened to the interests of particular industries -or of consumers in the United Kingdom;then, for so long as the certificate &quot;remains in force, suchdepartures from the provisions of the  Code relating to allowable cost increases, increases in tot.nl conts and net profit marginsshall be&apos;permitted by the dommission as the Secretary&quot; of State
particular Sectors72. The paragraphs which follow deal with the application of this Partof the Code to certain important sectors. Unless there is express provision to the contrary in those paragraphs, however, paragraphs 3 to 71 must betaken as applying to all enterprises.&apos;Manufacturing and Mining73.  Paragraphs 3 to 71 above apply in their entirety.Distribution74: (i) In the determination of prices for sales within the United Kingdom,wholesalers, retailers and other enterprises engaged in distribution should ensurethat their gross percentage margins do not exceed the proportion specified in sub-paragraph (ii) of the level of the gross percentage margin in cither(a) the last complete account year of the enterprise ending on or before30 April 1973; or(b) a. 12-month period ending between 30 October 1972 and 30 April 1973for which separate accounts are or can be made availableless in either case an appropriate reduction for the abolition of SET. Where an enterprise has not trailed long enough to establish a gross percentage margin   ;under (a) or (6), there shall be substituted the margin for a 12-month period ending not later than 31 March 1974 for which separate accounts are or can&apos;be made available.(ii) The proportion of the gross percentage margin referred to in sub-paragraph (i) will be(c) 100 per cent for any^^geriod before 6 May 1974;(b) 90 per cent for any peijocron or alter 6 May 1974.(iii) A figure of 100 per cent and not 90 per cent will however apply from 6 May1974 to(a) distributors engaged mainly in retailing with total annual sales of less than 250,000;(b) other distributors with total annual sales of less than  500,000;-(c) all sales of goods exempted from restrictions on resale price maintenanceby an order under section 5 of the Resale IJriccs Act 1964. .7&apos;!A. Where indirect taxes have been increased after 25 March 1974,an&apos;addition not exceeding the cash amount of the increase may be madeto prices charged by distributors. Where indirect taxes are reduced,the reduction must be fully reflected in prices. The cash amount of theincrease or reduction need not however be applied precisely to the goodsbearitui the indirect taxes.Safeguard for net profit margins74B. Where the application of the figure of 90 per cent in paragraph 74 (ii) (b)would --educe the net profit margin of the enterprise as defined in paragraphs 60and 61 to a level more than one-hnn.r-hor below the reference level, the figure may be increased(though not above 10*3 per cent) to the extent necessary to limit that reduction to one-quarter,I?o increase under paragraph 69A shTl be takeninto account in ap-ilyin&quot; this paragraph.75.  For all the purposes of the Code &quot;gross percentage margin&quot; means the aggregate difference between the cost to the distributor of all the goodshe sells in the home market in a period and the value of his sales of thosefoods in that period, expressed as a percentage of the sales value. Thedifference should be calculated according to the normal accounting practiceconsistently applied by the enterprise In arriving at sales and costs of sales,indirect taxes should be treated on the same basis as for calculating net profit margins in paragraph 63. In particular the cash value of increases^in indirect taxes after &apos;25 March 1974 should be deducted from both salesnd costs of s?les in arriving at current gross percentage ^margins.  Similarlycash equivalent of any tax reductions should be added&apos;to costs and sales.sthe76. The provisions of the Code relating to allow&amp;ECMMpJt increases dorot apply to distribution.
Distributors&apos; stocks77. In most cases prices determined by distributive enterprises will haveto take account of the cost of goods used from stock for sale. Such enter-prises should adhere to ihe practice they have followed consistently forpricing purposes in arriving at such costs and at the relevant gross percentage margins.,. ...Repricing77A. (i) Retailors should not increase the prices of goods that arc or have beendisplayed for sale by reference to increases in replacement costs, even if such price increases would otherwise be permitted by the Code.(ii) This paragraph does not apply:(a) to goods on which the average rate of annual stockturn is less than 10; or(b) to price increases directly resulting from the withdrawal of special offers; or(c) to goods exempted from restrictions on resale price maintenance by&apos;anorder under section 5 of the Resale Prices Act 1954; or(d) where the commission are satisfied, after consulting representative bodies,that the effect on prices of applying the paragraph would be contrary to consumers&apos; interests.Distributors making low profits &apos;. il73. An enterprise engaged in distribution may increase prices to cotter its total costs plus a margin(excluding any increase under paragraph 69AT&quot; of 2 percent, notwithstanding the limitation on gross percentage margins. Price increases may not be made under this paragraphif they cause the profit margin reference level referred to in paragraphs 57to f9 to be exceeded.Action where gross or net percentage margins are likely to be exceeded79.  Where:-(i) a distributors net profit margin or gross percentage margin has exceeded the level allowed under this Code; or.(ii) where in the light of interim accounts or other evidence, that level is likely to be exceeded,price reductions should be made; provided that in either case account hasbeen taken of seasonal and other distorting factors. The reduction shouldbe sufficient to eliminate the actual or expected excess over the permittedlevel as soon as reasonably possible, and to offset any excess which hasalready arisen in a period subsequent to 30 April 1973. .&apos;Variation of gross percentage marginsSO. (i) Where in the judgment of the Commission the conditions in sub-paragraph (iii) are met, they shall:(a) consult any body or person whom they regard as representative of enter-prises affected and take into account ali relevant information supplied bythem; . -, :i(b) consider whether the proportion of the gross percentage margin specifiedin paragraph 74 (ii) (i) should be varied accordingly whether by way of reduction or increase;(c) after consultation with the bodies or persons referred to in sub-paragraph(a) inform them of any variation in gross percentage margins which they&apos;consider appropriate in the light of the conditions in sub-paragraph (iii)and notify this to any enterprise. ((ii) Where a variation in gross percentage margins is notified under this,paragraph, paragraph 74 (ii)(i) shall be modified accordingly in its application.-1to that enterprise.(iii) The conditions referred to in sub-paragraph (i) are that as a result ofchances in value of turnover or operating costs for any enterprise or group ofienterprises, the gross percentage margin control in paragraph 74 affects net profit margins in a way that is substantially different from the general position in distribution, or which loads to wide-spread application of the safeguard inparagraph 741).Agriculture81. Part I of the Code dees not apply to agricultural enterprises engagedin the production and sale cf unprocessed agricultural produce Where suchenterprises arc engaged in manufacturing or preceding, however, their prices are controlled by reference to allowable cost increases and net profit margins. Where they are engaged in distribution, their prices arc controlled by reference to gross percentage nun-gins and net profit margins.
SICKETlionaliscd IndustriesJ2. Paragraphs 83 to 86 apply to the following nationalised industries: -National Coal Boardnicctricity Council 1Area Electricity BoardsCentral Electricity Generating board north of Scotland Hydro-Electric board south of Scotland Electricity Board .    aNorthern Ireland Electricity ServiceBritish Gas corporation british Steel Corporationi       Post office British Airways board british Airports authority british Railways Board .,British Transport Docks Board \\L British Waterways Board83.fl),   The provisions of the Code, except paragraphs 34 arid 68&quot;to/TT apply to &quot;the controlled activities of the nationalisedLndustri^sj-isted in paragraph 82, according to the nature of thebusiness,.o,f ^the,^ apply to private sector undertakingsThis paragraph and       paragraphs 83A to 8&quot;7&quot;&quot;&quot;apply in addition. &quot;&quot;*&quot;*(a )    In particular, a nationalised industry which is notin deficit on controlled activities may increase prices in accordance with those provisions nf the Code.(b) However, a nationalised industry which is in deficitr  -qg^corjt^ may increase prices inaccordance with those provisions, calculated &quot;withoutany deduction under paragraph 32.(c) A nationalised industry, whether or not it is in.....      deficit on controlled activities, may, in addition toany increase under sub-paragraph (a) or (b) above and paragraph 84A below, increase prices on controlledactivities by any further amount necessary to ensurethat sufficient revenue is received within the period from the date on which the increased price takes___effect to the end of the accountirgyear in question to provideon controiled activities over the whole of that year a surplusof 2 per cent, calculated on turnover on those activities inthat year, or, at the option of the industry concerned, a returnoifM0 per cent on net assets employed in con^olL^J\c^lYJ:tAes*allowance brurg made in either case for- any change ir. the volumeof&quot; sales which may reasonably be expected, to result from ines^asedprices and for any estimated coct increases during the remainder of that year.     In the case of any conflict between the provis-jons of this sub-paragraph and those of paragraphs 57 to 39jthis sub-paragraph ;. shallr - prevail. 9A nationalised industry may apply sub-paragraphs (a) to (c) separately to aseparate activity as defined in paragraph 17 or to a separate unit as defined in paragraph 60 (iii) whether or not the industry&quot;  3 in deficit.
(ii) For the purpose of this paragraph :-

(a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph 86A:-

(i) a nationalised industry is in deficit if it incurred a deficit on revenue account in the previous accounting year after providing for interest and depreciation;

(ii) in calculating a surplus all trading costs, and provision for interest and depreciation shall be deducted from revenue;

(iii) depreciation for the purposes of (i) and (ii) above includes provision for the writing off of displaced plant and deferred charges, and shall be calculated accordance with accounting principles consistently applied by the industry concerned (including the supplementary provision for depreciation at replacement cost made by the Post Office and British Transport Docks Board).

(b) return on net assets shall be calculated by expressing net revenue as a percentage of net assets, where -

(i) "net revenue" means revenue in the accounting year in which the price increase takes effect less trading costs and after providing for depreciation (excluding supplementary provision for depreciation at replacement cost) but before taking account of interest and taxation; and

(ii)"net assets" means the net book value total-assets less current liabilities at the end of the industry&apos;s accounting year preceding the accounting year in question.

(c) no account shall be taken of Government compensation or grants taken directly to revenue account.


S3A.    In determining sales value for the purpose of paragraph 26,no account shall, in the case of a nationalised industry, be taken of Government compensation or grants taken   directly to revenue account,84-.     The calculation of permitted tariff increases in the gasand electricity supply industries should be made having regardto the likely demand and consumption in the light of their statutory obligation to meet that demand,84A.    (1)    If the operation of a system of multi-part tariffs inthe gas and electricity supply industries reduces the averagerevenue per unit, the following additional provisions apply.In this paragraph, &quot;revenue&quot; means average revenue per unit and &quot;costs&quot; means average costs per unit.(\Z)   Where, since the base date -(a) revenue has fallen more than costs, prices may beincreased by an amount sufficient to restore the averagecash margin per unit at the base date;(b) revenue has fallen and costs have risen, prices maybe increased to the extent needed to restore revenue tothe level at the base date and also by allowable cost increases;    and_(c) prices have been increased and revenue has risen by less than costs have risen, prices may be increasedto the extent needed to produce a.revenue which is equivalent to the revenue at the base date plus allowablecjDsJ^increases^ incurred since the base date (including any cost increases already reflected in prices but excluding those which are to be reflected in future_______price increases to be made under any formula which allows for increases in the industry&apos;s prices on account ofvariation in costSjCRET
85. Where the responsible Minister notifies the Commission that a price increase resulting from the application of paragraph 83 would have an unacceptable effect on the general level of prices, the Commission will limit the permitted price increase to the amount specified as acceptable by the Minister, but not so as to reduce the increase below what is permitted by paragraph 83(i)(a) or (i)(b) as appropriate or paragraphs 84 and 84A. Furthermore, any increase permitted under paragraph 83(i)(c) (restricted if that be the case, under this paragraph) may be charged after the end of the accounting year in which it is first charged, but the responsible Minister:-

(i) may, from time to time, direct that the increase shall after the end of that accounting year, be reduced by such amount or amounts as he shall specify; and

(ii) may direct that the increase shall be extinguished on such a date at or after the end of that accounting year as he shall specify.

86. The application of the Code is subject to paragraph 87 in the case of the National Coal Board and the British Steel Corporation. In the case of the Post Office and those industries concerned with air and sea transport, it is subject to the exclusion from control under paragraph 6 of charges for international traffic. The prices of subsidiary companies of nationalised industries, including subsidiaries of the National Bus Company, National Freight Corporation and the Scottish Transport Group, are governed by paragraph 89 (ii). The prices charged for electricity by Area Electricity Boards and the Scottish Boards will be subject to the provisions of the Code applying manufacturers.

86A Where the finances of a nationalised industry are, as a result of any statute, re-constructed in or after 1974, the following provisions apply:-

(i) where the base date for the purpose of calculating the allowable cost increases of the industry precedes the re-construction and the date of implementation of the increased price follows the re-construction, it shall be assumed for the purposes of the calculation that the re-construction had taken effect on a date one year before the date on which it actually came into effect; and

(ii) any changes arising from the re-construction in the accounting practices of the industry or in the value of its assets and liabilities shall be taken into account in calculations under this Code.

Coal and steel

87. Prices charged by producers for coal, coal-based solid fuels, and most iron and steel products are outside the scope of the control by virtue of paragraph 6(ii). They are subject to international obligations through United Kingdom membership of the European Coal and Steel Community. Prices of non-ECSC iron and steel products are controlled like those of other manufactured products. Enterprises which produce both ECSC and non-ECSC iron and steel products will be subject to price control on the latter only. Prices of coal merchants and iron and steel merchants in the United Kingdom will be subject to the control on gross percentage margins and net profit margins applied to wholesaling and retailing enterprises.

Other public sector trading enterprises

88. The Commission will apply to proposals for price increases which are referred to them by Government Departments engaged in substantial trading operations the same principles as to proposals by the nationalised industries.

89. (i) The Code applies to the prices of the following enterprises, according to the nature of the business of the undertaking, as it applies to the prices of private sector enterprises:-


aarefor periods of 4 hours or more)of localauthorities, local authority joint boards, publicutility undertakings and other similar public sectorundertakings (not being a nationalised industry listed -in paragraph 82 or an undertaking to which paragrapnyrelates); andtale(b)    companies registered under the Companies Act whichare wholly or partly owned by Her Majesty&quot;s government or by a nationalised industry;except that the netprof remargin control does not apply to the trading services&quot;of 1oca1 author!ties .....(U). The charges for local authority&quot;trading services shall be calculated with regard to the established accounting practices ofthe enterprise concerned^aiid to cHang^iIh^thp^e; &quot;practices resultingfrom. .reorganisation..........Lo.(^te;au.th6ir4yie3: may -ad just their charges takenwithin the overall levels permitted by the Code to take account ofthe steps which&quot; tTtey may take Towards the resTrWCuFiHng&quot;of chargeswithin their areas.Water Undertakings90(i) 7/ater ^ujthorities and water undertakers in England and&quot; V/alesmust comply with their obligations under statute (including, inthe case of a company, any agreement between a water authority and the company under section 12 of the &apos;;,&apos;ater Act 1973) butshall have regard to the principles of the Code and shall notnake charges which, t.&quot;ken &quot;as a whole, are likely to result-ina higher revenue in any accounting year tlvan i  required tocomply with these obligations.(ii) Subpr.paragraph (i)&quot; applies to regional&apos;water.boar ds or-,to water authorities in Scotland ast it applies to water authorijtiesin England and V.&apos;ales, but in relation only to v/atofe supplied   bymeter.(iii) The principles set.out in paragraph 39(ii)above apply also-&quot; to the enterprises covered bythis paragraph.Services91.  In general, paragraphs 3 to 70 of the Code apply to the prices ofservice enterprises as they apply to those of manufacturers, so that the systemof&apos; allowable cost increases and the limitation on net profit margins as a percentage of sales or turnover apply to them. There will be an offset toallowable cost increases as a result of the abolition of Selective Employment.Tax for service enterprises where this paid without refund.Parapi;:phi, 33 to 40 permit the Commission to calculate average allow-able cost changes for certain small service enterprises where the citcurhstancesare appropriate. Paragraph 69 would permit services enterprises with lowprofits to calculate their reference levels for the limit on net profit marginsby reference cither to turnover or capital employed. &apos;. :   ......   paragraphs 92 to 106deal with the application of the Code to some particular scrvir:. sectors, and explain any modifications of the general principles which apply to thcni.(a)    trading services,  ( ?Jut not&apos;including- on-streetParking, or off-street parking where the charges
Banks, finance houses and similar enterprises92. Most banks, finance houses and similar financial enterprises, arc.encaged partly in business for which the charge is a rate of interest andpartly in business for which the charge is of a different nature. interest charges are not within the- control. The other charges of these enterprisesare subject to control. It will therefore be necessary to allocate costs andprofiis between the. two classes of business for the purpose of the control onlion-interest charges. Paragraph 3? applies.93.  For the-purposes of the Code the enterprises described in para-graph 92 may treat as goods and services exported:  (i) transactions in sterling with any person or body corporateresident outside the United Kingdom; and(ii) dealings in foreign currencies.94. The provisions of the Code relating to allowable cost increases ancto the limitation on net profit margins, defined in the case of these enter-prises as in paragraphs 96 and 97, apply to their non-interest charges. These&quot;include commissions, fees and all similar charges. Where ad valorem rates are charged and these rates are charged generally, they must be treated asmaxima. Enterprises will, however, be free to adjust their rates to match the credit status of a client provided such adjustments are in accordancewith normal practice in such cases. In calculating charges these enterprises,should take fully into account all factors including customers&apos; balanceswhich enter the costing of the class of transaction for which the charge ismade. They should treat changes in those factors as the basis for increasesor reductions in the charges in accordance with the Code.95. The provisions of the Code will apply in full to charges in hire purchase, conditional sale and plant and machinery leasing agreements.Changes in the monthly Finance Houses Base Rate may be taken as themeasure of increases or reductions in interest costs for the calculation ofallowable cost increases, provided that rate is used consistently for all thepurposes of the Code.     ;$95A. In the case of an agreement&apos;for the leasing of anyeouipment on which t	he lessor&apos;s capital expenditure	is morethan  5,000, inaneas	es in rentals may be made under	a formula,specified in the agr	lemeht, providing for variation	of rentalson account of change	s in the rateof corporation tax	to theextent that the rate	of return to the lessor on his	capitalexpenditure net of corporation tax is not greater than it wouldhave been if the rate of corporation tax had^remained at thatin force. at the..date,of the agreement or, if the formulaspecifies another date for that purposetat that date.96.  For the purposes of paragraph 57 &quot; net profit margin&quot; means:  (i) in the case of enterprises undertaking hire purchase, conditionalsale or piant and machinery leasing contracts, where either thegreater part of the business of the enterprise consists of such contracts, or separate accounts can be produced for such contracts, net income from charges for this business lessassociated costs, including overheads, expressed as a proportionof average resources employed;(ii) in the case of all other enterprises of the kind described in .paragraph 92 net income from charges (that is, gross incomeless costs, including associated overheads) expressed as a per-cenlagc of gross income (that is, total income from the transactions concerned).97. In comparing net profit margins, as defined in paragraph 96, withthe reference level, account should be taken of the total profitability of thenon-interest business of the enterprise concerned in determining the permitted level of charges.
3     la S-i L. 11Construction ,  ,98. In determining prices for construction contracts enterprises-shouldhave regard to the Code as it applies to manufacturing enterprises. Ofparticular relevance to construction are paragraph 48, which applies .totenders for construction work to the extent that they are at fixed prices, and.paragraphs 49 to 52, which apply to variation of price clauses, prime costr.ml coALreimburscment arrangements.Transport- 99. The Code applies to transport undertakings as it docs to other1 service enterprises. Charges for international freight and passenger trafficI are outside the control under paragraph 6(vi). Charges of nationalised]transport undertakings, passenger transport authorities, local authorityI transport undertakings and transport companies owned by ^nationalisedI industries and their subsidiaries are governed by paragraphs 82^8(5Aand 89.: 100. Charges of private road haulage undertakings are subject to theI provisions relating to allowable cost increases and to the limitations on netI profit margins.Me hide sales and services  101. Charges for repair, maintenance and servicing of vehicles areIsubject to the provisions relating to allowable cost increases and to the^limitation on net profit margins. The prices of vehicles sold by distributors,Iwhcther new or second-hand, are subject to the limitations on grossjlpcrcentage margins and on net profit margins. Paragraph 17 applies tojcnlerprises which both sell and maintain vehicles.Hotels and catering enterprisesI 102. What is said in paragraph 91 applies to these enterprises also, inIrcspect both of charges for food and drink and for accommodation.wto\essional or other services -I 103. Fees and charges for professional or other services by firms or by individuals who nrc self-employed are governed as prices by the Code,Except where the disbursements or expenses&apos;wholly and&apos; &quot; &apos;&quot;Ixciusiveiy laid out or expended for the purposes of the enterprise concerned do not exceed 10 per cent of thejrofits or gains of that enterprise.1 104. Where scales or rates of charges ot general application, whethercalculated per item, at an hourly rate or ad- valorem, arc in use in aprofession under instructions or advice issued by a professional organisation,those scales or rates must be treated as maxima and may net be increasedgvithout the agreement of the Commission. Where rates above scale havelornially been agreed and have become normal charges, such rates need it&apos;! be reduced but the margin by which such rates exceed the scalp maylot be increased. The Commission will apply the provisions relating tofclojvablc cost increases to increases in scaies or rates. Those provisionsJvill also apply to increases in fees or charges calculated on a time basis,pcept that the productivity deduction in paragraph 32 need not be appliedIvhcre the fee or charge reflects only the labour cost of any employees&apos; time.I 135. Where there arc no scales or rates of general application, the rateslr scales charged for a professional service may not be increased except tolifiect increases in allowable costs. Increases in labour costs under para-graph 2S(ii)((v) may not include any element in respect of proprietors&apos; orwinners&apos;, as distinct from employees&apos;, time.
105. The limitation on net profit margins will apply to profit:; of linnsor individuals providing professional or other services irrespective of themethod by which fees arc determined. Where the number of partners in a professional practice has changed as a result of the substitution of apartner for an employee, or of an employee for a partner, the referencelevel may be recalculated by reference to the changed number of partner^.Paragraph 66 applies to amalgamations of partnerships. In applying theprovisions relating to allowable cost increases to scales or rates of charges,the Commission will have regard to profit margins in the professiongenerally and will apply paragraphs 34, 59 and 68-69 as necessary.Non-profit-making organisations107.  Subscriptions charged by organisations which:(i) exist for religious, charitable, educational, representational orrecreational purposes; and(ii) are non-profit-making; and(iii) do not carry on a trade or business as thcinmain activity, willnot be controlled.108. The Code will not apply to prices charged by an organisationsatisfying the tests in paragraph 107, or by any properly authorised personacting on behalf of that organisation, if they are charged in order to raisefunds for the purposes of the organisation, and involve no substantial orcontinuing competition with trading enterprises.109. Except where they are outside the control under paragraph 108,prices charged in any trading activity carried on by an organisation whichmeets the requirements of paragraph 107 are governed by the Code, unless,the customers of the trading activity are confined to members of theorganisation.Where the particular provisions of the Code cannot be directly&quot;applied to particular cases or sectors without modification, the &apos;.. Com-mission :     . . - will, in exercising their functions, apply those provisions with such adaptations or modifications as appear to-them to benecessary to give effect to the principles and objectives of the Code.
SECRET * .   ^ SS^LLTHE INVESTMENT RELIEF SCHEMEnufacturing and Service SectorsQualifying Expenditure -1     The scheme permits enterprises in these sectors to reflect in their profit margins and prices a proportionof their estimated capital expenditure in a forward periodof 12 months on new and secondhand plant and machinery(excluding vehicles) and on the construction of industrial buildings, but excluding expenditure on the acquisition of&apos; . in.&quot;existing companies.    To qualify, expenditure must relateto activities within the control;    but where this cannot be precisely established, apportionment of total investment inplant, machinery and industrial buildings will be ^asedupon the proportion of total turnover in the last completedyear of account that was within the control.2     The cash amount of the relief will be 17^$ of the qualifying expenditure approved by the Board of the enterpriseto be spent over a period of 12 months from a date following the introduction of the scheme.    Any amounts expected to bereceived from the disposal of plant, machinery and industrial buildings during the same period will be deducted fromoualifyingexpenditure under the scheme;    but amounts relating to theAsale, as a going concern, of parts of the enterprise toanother enterprise need not be deducted.Price Increases3 Prices may be increased to the extent necessary to increaseprjOfits by the amount of the relief.    Price increases will not
be restricted to products which are the direct subjectof the qualifying investment.    However, to avoid excessiveprice increases on any one product:-not it forms part of a range of related products,may not be increased under the investment reliefprovisions by more than three times the average increase (which is represented by the permittedincrease in the net profit: margin reference level ),b     Any investment relief price increase will be calculated on the assumption that it will apply for a period of12 months from the date of implementation.    Thetotal amount of the relief should not, in consequence,be recouped in less than 12 months. ^These price increases will not be taken into account in deciding whether the provisions of the Code on safeguards against low profit or erosion of profit may be invoked.Increases in Net Profit Margin Reference Levels4       Net profit margin reference levels may be increased to accommodate additional profit equivalent to the cash amountof the relief, calculated as a percentage of the estimatedturnover of the enterprise in the forward-period of 12 months(beginning at any date after the revised Code takes effect)referred to in paragraph 1 above.Example:Enterprise with estimated tnrnover of  120m andforecast qualifying investment of  10m.Cash amount of relief at l&apos;7%% of qualifyingexpenditure................................ 1.75mAddition to reference level 1.7.5aThe price of any individual product, whether orThus a reference level of 8%

Subsequent price increases under the scheme will besubject, for enterprises in these Categories, to 28 daysprenotification.   The information required is set out inmore detail in Secbion C below.Implementation; Other Categories6    Enterprises below Category II are not required toprenotify or report increases in reference levels, or price increases under this scheme; and such increases maybe implemented as soon as the scheme comes into effect.  .Category III enterprises availing themselves of the reliefwill however be required to keep appropriate records whichofficials of the Price Commission will have power to inspect.Implementation: Genera]/7    Price increases under the scheme will not be subjectto the &quot;three month rule&quot; in paragraph 26B of the Code.8     The scheme only permits the cash amount of the relief to be recovered.   Price increases permitted under thesecrIt
scheme are therefore to be regarded as separate sucharges/which cannot attract further profit margins if prices are increased subsequently under other.provisions of the Code.B     Distribution Enterprises9     The provisions set out above and relating to net profit margins apply equally to distribution enterprises.Such enterprises may also make an addition to theirpermitted gross percentage margins, calculated as in thefollowing example:Example: (IEnterprise with estimated turnover .of   20 million and forecast qualifying investment of   2 millionCash amount of relief at 17%% of     Wqualifying expenditure...................... 350,000Addition to gross percentage margin as ascertained under paragraph 74- of the Code( 350,000 x lorA 17^&apos;( 20TOS7- x 1001............................X-75/0Thus, a permitted gross percentage margin of 20^ may riseto 21.75$.10   Category II distributors will be required to submit a claim for relief to the Price Commission 56 days before putting their revised net and/or gross profit margins intoeffect.    Category III distributors availing themselves of therelief will be required to keep appropriate records whichthe officials of the Price Commission will have power to inspect.C   Monitoring Procedures for all Enterprises11    Initially, all Category I and II enterprises as, definedfor net profit margin purposes wishing to participate   inthe scheme will be required to furnish the following information to the Price Commission:-
SSCKSTa   Name and address of unit for profit margincontrolb    Statements of:- ^ ri expenditure on plant, machinery(excludingvehicles) and the construction of industrial buildings and the method of allocation betweencontrolled and uncontrolled activities;ii sales within the control;in each of the three previous years of account,c   Estimates of qualifying expenditure and the periodof 12 months to which it relates, divided between thefirst and second periods of 6 months and supported byevidence of Board approval^   Estimates of the receipts from disposals of such assets during the same period will also be required,d   Cash amount of the relief claimed, based on 17%%of qualifying expenditure net of proceeds of disposals,e   Estimated sales within the control during the periodof 12 months used in calculating thel investment relief,f   Claimed addition to net profit margin reference leveland, for distributors, claimed addition to gross percentage margin.12     In addition to the above, manufacturers and service enterprises prenotifying price increases based on investmentrelief (see also paragraph ji above) should provide thefollowing information:-

Appendix 2glfioatiow aim iiifcriiatioit otedersThese Orders impose obligations on companies to prenotify price increases,i make regular reports to the Price Commission or to keep specified records,icording to the size and activity of the company concerned.   The Price Commissionthereby able to obtain the information necessary to examine proposed pricecreases and to monitor the observance of the Code.The Government do not propose to make any major change to the structure ofe-notificationj reporting and record keeping which has been built up over  life of price controls.   however  a considerable number of amendments toj Orders will be required in consequence of the proposed changes to the Code,addition, five significant changes are to be made to the Orders which dc notLlow directly from the proposed amendments to the Code.   They are as follows(a) Identification of Category III firmsCategory III firms are defined in the Information Order (SI 1973/1787)as:-a   manufacturers with sales in the last year of account of  1m- 5rnub   distributors with sales of  250,000- 10mc   providers of services with sales of  250,000- 5md   providers of construction services with sales of  1m- 5me   providers of professional services with sales of  100,000- 500,000f banks, finance houses and similar enterprises with outstandingbalances of more than  10m but with gross sterling deposits of 200m or less.They are at present required to keep records including the informationspecified in Part I of the Schedule to the Information Order.   The government intend to require that before 1 February 1975, all Category III firms should&apos;send to the Price Commission a return giving particulars of their name and address, the name and address of any subsidiary and the sales in the latestcomplete year of account for each activity, including those of any subsidiaries,The information required will be    . -.   .the minimum necessary to enable the regional staff of the Price Commissionto direct their monitoring activities more towards the key areas in this very important section of industry.(b) Exemption of minor activities from pre-notificationArticle 6 of the Notification Order (SI 1973/1786) provides for the exemption from pre-notification of the minor and separate activities of pre-notifying firms.   At present the maximum value for each exemptedactivity is set at  3m for Category I firms (manufacturers with annualsales of over  30m and service enterprises with annual sales of over  20m)but at only  500,000 for Category II firms (manufacturers with sales of 5m- 50m and service enterprises with sales of  5- 20m).   Thus thereis a very pronounced difference in the position under this Article between,for example, manufacturers with sales of  51m and  ^9m.   The government intend to even out this disparity by allowing the exemption for minor activitiesof Category II companies, under the conditions currently specified in the notification Order, provided that the value of each activity does not exceed10$ of the total sales of the enterprise.(c) Exemptions for sales within a group of companiesUnder Article 9 of the Notification Order sales within a group of companies are at present exempt from the obligation to pre-notify price increases.   Hie Government intend to reduce the scope of this exemption to
prevent a manufacturer from escaping from the requirement to pre-notifyprice increases by means of setting up a distribution company within thegroup.   The exemption is therefore to be limited to sales within a groupwhere both buyer and seller are manufacturers or providers of services.(d) Reclassification of scrap processors and small bakehousesIn response to representations from the trade associations concerned,the Government propose to change the classification, for price controlpurposes, of scrap processors and of bakers manufacturing in small bakehousesattached to retail establishments.   Both categories will be transferred from the distribution to the manufacturing sector, and the Code rules formanufacturers will apply.(e) Local authoritiesWhilst the Code applies generally to the &quot;trading services&quot; of localauthorities, it has teaa proved difficult to define more precisely the services for which local authorities should be obliged to pre-notify price increases. and make regular reports to the Price Commission.   Different authorities may provide different ranges of services and may have different views ofthe degree to which these services should be operated on commercial lines.Taking account of the need to avoid imposing unnecessary administrativeburdens on local authorities, the Government therefore propose that theobligations of local authorities under the Notification and InformationOrders should be confined to the keeping of the appropriate records, byauthorities down by district council level, for any service covered by theOrders which is provided by the authority concerned.   The Price commission will be free to undertake inspections of these records and to investigatecomplaints about charges for any of these services which it considers tobe operated as trading services by the local authority concerned.COUNTER-DIFLATION (MODIFICATION OF CIVIL AVIATIOIT ACT 1971 ) ORDERAn Order was made on 26 April 1973 which modified the Civil Aviation Act1971 in such a way as to require the Civil Aviation Authority to have regard tothe Price Code in determining charges &quot;for carriage by air within the UnitedKingdom.   The Authority prescribes a common tariff for all airlines operatingservices on a route.   Some routes are served   both by British Airv/ays and byother airlines, and a potential problem lay in the fact that British Airways, asa nationalised industry, was not required to observe the same provisions in thePrice Code as were private sector airlines.   To avoid this anomaly the Order ,.is to be ftmtriaimr amended:   the Authority will in future have regard to theprovisions of the Code but subject to the criteria set out in Policy GuidanceCmnd 1(899.
