DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government(74) 132 ; OACOPY NO      5f)15 November 1974CABINETDEFENCE REVIEW - ECONOMIC ANDEMPLOYMENT IMPLICATIONSMemorandum by the Central Policy Review staff.        At their meeting on 31 October (CC(74) 42nd Conclusions) theCabinet instructed the Central Policy Review Staff, in consultationwith the Departments concerned, to prepare studies on the impact onthe economy broadly of the resource demands of defence and on the implications of the proposed reductions for the shipbuilding andaerospace industries.2. Our reports are attached to this note; they have been prepared in consultation with the Treasury, the Departments of Employment andIndustry, and the Ministry of Defence.3.        Study of the impact on the economy of defence expenditure leads to the following conclusions:-a. In the 1950s, following the Korean War, United Kingdomdefence expenditure rose rapidly and this expansion adversely affected exports, investment and economic growth.b. How much our growth performance during the past 10-15 years has been affected by the level of defence expenditure is muchmore uncertain: it is arguable that, if industry had been moredynamic, it could have created the productive capacity and skillsnecessary for faster growth while sustaining a defence burden which was in fact falling; on the other hand, it can be argued that the kind of shifts which would have been required to move towards faster growth were made more difficult by the concentration of skill and effort on defence.c. The economic situation requires a major shift of resourcesinto the balance of payments and productive investment over thenext five years; redeployment of resources from defence has animportant part to play in this process.    Moreover, given thefact that defence is a large consumer of skilled manpower,resources released from it could make a particular contributionto meeting the present and prospective shortage.
d.    When compared for example with the reduction of defence expenditure between 1964 and 1970, the scale of the rundownshould be, in general, manageable.4. The employment implications of the proposed reductions for thedefence industries are as follows:-a. Compared with previous plans, the defence review willmake available to the lab our market by 1978-79 some 44, 000servicemen and 20, 000 United Kingdom based civil servants;by 1978-79 10, 000 workers will be released from the defenceindustries, with a further 35, 000 by 1983-84.    Thus the totalreductions, service and civilian, will be of the order of74, 000 by 1978-79 and a further 35, 000 by 1983-84.b. Decisions on the mix of type 22 frigates ;and type 42destroyers are needed before the employment implications canbe fully evaluated.    A major cut in the frigate programme would threaten the future of Yarrows on Clydeside, where theeffects would be felt as early as next year; reduction in the destroyer programme would produce no job losses in SwanHunter (Tyneside) and Cammell Laird (Merseyside) but thesetwo firms would no longer need, as was previously expected by the Ministry of Defence, to expand their work force in theyears ahead for warship building.c. Reductions in the previously planned defence aircraft programme will produce difficulties for Hawker Siddeley aviation at Bitteswell (Coventry) and Manchester, for the British aircraft corporation (BAG), for Westlands at Yeovil, and for Rolls Royce(71) particularly in the Watford area.    The effects, however,will be much less significant than the general decline in theaircraft industry, both military and civil, which was already in prospect before this review began.d. In the guided weapon and electronics programmes, the lossof Sea Skua would leave BAC(GW) with no development project in prospect; in addition Shorts would lose about 300 jobs in belfast.e. Employment in the Royal Ordnance Factories will beaffected by the defence review, but potential overseas salesmay offset most of the employment implications.
f.    Special efforts will therefore need to be made in a fewareas, which cannot be precisely identified as yet, if thedefence review is not to lead to local unemployment.    In.general, adequate retraining and resettlement schemes shouldbe sufficient to ensure that the resources released by thedefence review are used productively.Cabinet Office15 November 1974
&apos;.  ;&quot; &apos;.. ; i &apos;    -     ii in 1973-74 defence expenditure tlras estimated to account for yffoof total available output (ie Gross National Product),   This compares with about 6-j$ in 1963-64 and       in 1970-71.      Unlike many other forms ofpublic expenditure, defence makes significant demands on industrial output.In 1970 (the last year for which figures are available of both the direct and indirect effects of defence procurement) it took. 49$ of the net outputof the aerospace Industry, 31$ Of shipbuilding and marine engineering and$ of total engineerings      Within the latter total defence&apos; accounted for17% of the net output of electronics.and telecommunications, Tp of instrumentengineering and. 11$ of other mechanical engineering.    By way of contrastother forms of current expenditure by public authorities make much heavieruse of the service industries.2. Defence also makes a call on the balance of payments;   allowing for arms exports and the import content of domestically produced equipment, aswell as imports of military equipment and the costs of stationing troopsabroad, the annual deficit is some  250m.        &apos;.(&apos;! ii3. Defence, which is rather more labour-intensive than total finaloutput, is also a user of skilled manpower, much of it directly suitable for industry and currently in short supply.       Its direct and indirect labour requirements absorbed about 5$ of the total labour force in 1970*Defence andJfcon0mio Grcw the. During the past 25 years&apos;. -(a) the share of our&apos; devoted to defence expenditure in the UK has beenhigher than that in any other major western industrialised countryapart-from the United States, and apart from Prance during the later1950s and early 1960s.      The share, nevertheless, declinedprogressively between the mid-1950s and the early 1970s:(b) the UK*s rate of economic growth, as measured by the rate oil!increaseof GDP per person employed, has been slower than that of any other major industrial country apart from the United States.    It v/as,nevertheless, somewhat faster in the 1960s than in the 1950s, andfaster than the pre-war trend.5. This prompts the question:   how far is the UK&apos;s slew rate of productivity increase the consequence of a disproportionately high level ofdefence expenditure?        No-one can give an unequivocal answer to thisquestion,.      The factors explaining differences between rates of productivitygrowth in different industrialised countries are complex and are not fully understood.tsxm tiss^i%  ftsvi.   ntkkh tzzpM
6. It is certainly the case, however, that the very large increasein the UK&apos;s defence expenditure which followed the outbreak of the KoreanWar, when it was increased to llfo of GNP, had very serious consequences.These were mainly caused by the attempt to raise defence, expenditure bya large amount in a relatively short period of time.       The burden thisimposed on the engineering industries(a) reduced our. capacity to increase productive investment on the scalenecessary for faster growth;*   ife &apos; &apos;-,./,/,&quot; - v&quot; &apos; , &amp;     I; - ;(b) diverted to defence resources vjhiclf I might otherwise have been usedto increase engineering exports;    in consequence, countries withsmaller defence burdens - eg Germany, Japan and Italy - were ableto gain strong competitive advantages in international trader76 The effects of a high level of defence expenditure in the period u1950-55 were therefore prejudicial to the investment a.nd export performanceWhich we would have needed if we were to have matched the growth achievementsof continental Europe and Japan.8. It is more.difficult to show that in recent years our above averageexpenditure on defence has been a major cause of our poor economic performanceIn part this is because the share of defence expenditure in GNP has been falling, so that some scarce skills and industrial capacity have been release!for other purposes.     In part it is because over a period of 10 to 15 yearsone would expect in &amp; dynamic society sca,rce skills or capacity to be made good by investment and training;    our engineering industries could then haveexpanded productive capacity and productivity more rapidly and have,simultaneously been able to meet the claims of defence expenditure and supply&apos;export markets and domestic investment demandsc       If this has not happenedone has to look to the general causes of lack of flexibility and dynamism iaour economy rather than to a defence expenditure somewhat above a,vera,ge,9* On the other hand, it is sometimes argued that defence expenditure has positive advantages for economic growth,     Defence involves R &amp; I) inadvanced technology:   this provides spin-off for civil technology,     VJhilethis is true in principle, and may have occurred, in some instances in theUnited States, there is little evidence that the UK has enjoyed any significantadvantages from this kind of technological spin-off.^efenoe .and Inflation100 In so far as a higher defence burden means a higher tax burden, andthe tax burden is a contributory cause of pressure for higher money wages,defence expenditure could be regarded as a contributory cause of cost iia Iation.put in this respect its effects are not very different from other forms ofpublic expenditure.The General Imolioations^of the Defence Review11. Xt is proposed that defence expenditure as a proportion, of GNPreduced from it s* 1973-74 level of ^f/o to 4c/i by 1984.     This would involvesavings on the 1974 Long-Term Costings of  475m in 1973-79 and  750m in1983-34, at 1974 prices.     Defence expenditure would, as a result, be at abuithe same level in real terms as it is now and yet the saving of  750m in1983-84 would correspond to about&apos;-lfo of GNP.II
12. The general management of the economy over the next 5-10 yearsrequires this kind of restraint on defence expenditure.       Over the next5 years, the most urgent tasks are to get sufficient resources into thecurrent account of the balance of payments to^ get back into balance byaround 1979$ and to increase productive investment *      The needs of thebalance of payments and investment are such that the growth of both public expenditure and private consumption need to be severely restrained.   Evenif defence expenditure is kept roughly constant in real terms, as thedefence review proposes, the rate of increase in other public expenditure programmes and in private consumption will be so slow as to create serious difficulties for the management of incomes and prices and for a lot ofpublic services,, II13. Directly or indirectly, defence employs a large amount of skilledengineering labour and productive capacity.       Redeployment of labour and investment that would otherwise have gone to defence could make an effective contribution to increasing exports and productive capacity.14. It remains to be seen how easily a resource shift of the proposed order of magnitude could be- made.       The proposals in 0(74)116 requireservice strengths to fall by some 44,000 compared with previous plans;this would be achieved by 1978-79? by some cut-back in recruitment, by not extending engagements, by normal wastage and by unavoidable redundanciesof up to 12,000.      Those leaving the services during this period will beolder and more skilled than the average ex-serviceman;   their skills maynot, however, be those required by industry (aircrew and aircraft maintenanceengineers for example) and an effective retraining programme will thereforebe needed as well as adequate redundancy terms to ease the transition.There would also be a reduction by 1978-79 of 20,000 UK-based civil servants(10,000 non-industrial and 10j000 industrial);   wastage should deal with mostof the non-industrial staff but some 6,500 industrial civil servants mightbe declared redundant and could require retraining before they could beemployed elsewhere.      Finally, direct employment in the defence industries is likely to fall by some 10,000 by 1978-79 and 45,000 by 1983-84.15. While some time is needed for the effective redeployment of resourcesredeployment on the scale discussed above should not cause overalldifficulties.      After World War II we carried out an effective redeploymentof resources from war production on a much bigger scale than that now at issue and historically there have been even more massive shifts from one peace-timeindustry to another.        During the period 1964-1970 when the Labour Governmeixwere last in office, Service strengths were reduced by 54,000&apos;and civiliansemployed by MOD were reduced by 30,000.      At present there is a severeshortage of some types of skilled engineering manpower which is preventing the general and mechanical engineering industries from exploiting fully theexport opportunities open to them;   and the latest medium-term industrialassessment foresees a continuation of this situation to at least the end of1975*        The release of skilled manpower from the defence industries could help to alleviate this problem.16. A shift of the magnitude now envisaged will, however, cause problemsof transition for particular groups of employees and for specific firms;   thedevelopment areas may also require special consideration.        But it shouldbe possible to identify these problems in advance and. with appropriateplanning, both of the implementation of defence cuts and of the re-employmentmeasures, to reduce to a minimum personal hardship and waste of resources.If this is done, a progressive reduction in the proportion of GNP devoted, to defence expenditure should result in an efficient switching of resources.
iwiiaicb REVIEW - industrial amplobisht implicationAt this stage of the Defence Review it is possible to identify onlythe &quot;broad implications for industrial employment of the proposed changes inthe defence equipment programme.      There are two main reasons for the lackof precision:(a) The pattern of expenditure on equipment cannot be determined indetail, until the Ministry of Defence has a decision on the levelof resources to be made available.;   even on the basis set out inG(74)ll6, more time is required to settle the internal composition of the programme.(b) at any level of expenditure, a 10 year equipment programme will-contain a considerable degree of uncertainty towards the end ofthe period;   the loading on the industry.in the 1980s will dependon the outcome of development work in the late 1970s and. on changesin the operational requirements of the Services during that time.The following paragraphs set out the best estimates which can be made, bothin total and by specific industry, of the employment,implications of theDefence Review.2,      &apos;     The current level of industrial employment, directly associated withMOD requirements, is estimated at 240,000.     On the assumption thatproductivity in the defence industry improves broadly in accordance with national trends, at about 3/&amp; a year, the forecast level of employment in theindustry would, on the &quot;basis of 0(74) 116, fall by 10,000 by 1978-79 and45?000 by 1983-84.     Much of this reduction would be likely to be &quot;broughtabout by wastage and retirements.        How far it would result in actual,,redundancies cannot be assessed at this stage - much depends on the generalstate of the economy and the outlook for particular defence firms in other fields at the time.3. Alterations to the defence equipment programme will also affectemployment in ancillary industries, but the effect cannot be quantified.Thus, the overall decline from the current level of employment on defence equipment of 10,000 jobs by 1978-79 and 45,000 jobs by 1983-84 may be anunderestimate.       In addition it conceals, considerably higher percentagereductions in certain sectors, in some cases in earlier years.Shipbuilding and repairing4, The way in which the warship-building firms will be affected bythe proposed cuts-depends on decisions not yet taken on the mix of type 22frigate and type 42 destroyer requirements.      The worst case from theemployment point of view would be a major cut in the type 22 programme.This would threaten the future of Yarrows on Glydeside, which current lyemploys over 5j000 men. and affect an unknown number of ancillary workersin the area.       The company would feel the effects as early as next year.If. the axe fell more heavily on the type 42 programme, the effects wouldbe felt by Swan Hunter (Tyneside) and Gammell Laird (Merseyside);    therewould however be no job losses compared with; the present loading, &quot;butprospects would be considerably diminished by comparison with MQD*s previous
ten-year forecast * In addition, the decision to carry out more naval siijjrepair work in the Royal Naval dockyards could mean the loss of about 1,005jobs, mainly on the Tyne and the Clyde, with some reductions on Merseysideand in Falmouth .5. UK shipbuilding currently employs some 70,000 and ship repairing26,000.      Decisions on the frigate/destroyer mix could have seriousimplications for Yarrows but the overall&apos; reduction in job opportunities in shipbuilding generally as a result of the defence review should,  in itself,prove manageable.       The defence implications must however be taken intoaccount in deciding the organisation and objectives for the nationalisedshipbuilding and ship repair industry.Aircraft6. Before the current defence review began it was estimated that thenwould be a substantial decline on military aircraft construction as exista;projects tail off.       Hawker Siddeley Aviation (BSA) will be worst hit.They currently employ nearly 15,000 people on military projects, but thiswill fall to between 5)500 and 6,500 (depending on how successful exports a;by the early 1980s and less thereafter;   the main rundown would be at theirManchester factories (which are also sensitive to civil aircraft changes),Employment in the British Aircraft Corporation (BAG) on military work,predominantly in the Preston area, might have risen from the current levelof about 12,000 to about 15,000 (possibly more if exports went well) by - theend of 1976, falling to around 11,000 by I983.    (BAC*s civil side would fallby the early 1980s from about 12,000 to a negligible number, as the Concord;programme was completed).7. The defence cuts now proposed will involve the cancellation of theArgosy rear crew trainer conversion, involving the loss of some 500 manufacijobs during the next 12 months, which could affect the viability of the HS1factory at Bitteswell, Coventry, (current employment 1,200). Other defencecuts now proposed could bring forward into 1975 &quot;the loss of some 3,000 jobselsewhere in HSA, mainly at Manchester. BACs ifork load on military desiand production is now likely to rise from about 12,000 to a peak of 14,000:1976 falling to around 10,000 by 1983.8. Westlands viability as a designer of helicopters will be seriously affected by the proposed measures, which include cancellation of the Wesson;replacement, reduction in the standard of the Sea King replacement, and cuisin reenxirements for Lynx and Gazelle. Even assuming no improvement inproductivrty, Westland*s workforce on military projects would,- it is &quot;thou^ii,come down from 6,900 to 4y200 by I98I. The cuts in helicopter requiremestwill entail a. reduction in engine orders on the Rolls Royce Small EngineDivision; current employment of 3,200 might be reduced to 2,300 by 1^80-%and this could result in the closure of the Divisions factory in the Waffojarea and the transfer of the rest of the work to other locations. In additiRolls Royce employment on other military work would probably be cut by aroffi4&quot;j000 from an&apos; expected&quot; level &quot;on military work of some 21,0&apos;So in the early!;9. Apart from the effect on VJestlands which could lead to difficultredundancy problems in the Yeovil area,, the effects of the defence review on the aircraft industry are much less significant than the general rundownof activity which, had already been identified, both on the military and cit, -   2 &apos;
sides, before the review began.       They will, however, be a,n additionalcomplication in determining the structure and objectives of the nationalised industry.Guided weapons and electronics10* The future loading of the main guided weapons firms (Hawker SiddeleyDynamics and BAC) depends to a large extent on whether orders for serviceequipment in the next year or two are placed with them or whether they h&apos;dveto be placed with overseas suppliers.      The loss of the Sea Skua projectwill leave BAC(GW) with no development project in prospects     Reductions inorders for Blowpipe, under the defence cuts now proposed, are likely toentail a reduction of one-third of those employed on guided weapons at Shortsin Belfast (potential job losses of 300),     In the electronics industry the firms most likely to be affected are not in areas of high unemployment.For example:   Marconi Radar Systems, Leicester;   Ferranti, Oldham (ahintermediate area);   Plessey, Ilfords Addlestone, and Cowes;   Electricand Musical Industries, Wells;   and Marconi Space/and Defence Systems,Stanmcre, Frimley, and Portsmouth (although the company&apos;s factory atHillend, Edinburgh, may be affected to some extent).Vehicles and conventional armaments11, Cuts in vehicle requirements might lead to a reduction in employment at ROF Leeds from 1,600 to 1,100;    in isolation, this could affect thefactory&apos;s viability, but possible large overseas orders could more than offset the cuts resulting from the defence review.      Reductions inconventional armaments requirements could mean a cut of 300 in the labour force of the ROFs, the worst affected being Chorley.      Both Leeds andChorley are in intermediate areas,     (The employees are mainly industrial civil servants 3,nd their numbers a,re not therefore included in .para 2)eII&quot;//&apos; i
