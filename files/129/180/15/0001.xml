DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 140 COPY NO2 December 1974CABINETENERGY SAVINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Energy1. I presented an interim package of possible non-budgetary energysavings to the Economic Strategy Committee on 4 November and the subject was further discussed at Chequers on 17 November,    In consequence I nowattach a draft statement which I would propose to make to the House,2. The package embodied in the draft statement represents, I believe,about the minimum that would be likely to be acceptable to opinion at home/and abroad as a serious response to the situation in which we now find ourselves.    Taken together with the Budget measures and the savings that have already been achieved it can be presented as a significant step towardsthe international goal of a reduction of oil imports by the industrialised countries in 1975 and subsequently.3. The statement does not attempt to quantify the total savings to beexpected from the present package.    Many of the effects are cumulativeover time, and much depends on the response we secure in industry,commerce and the home.    But I am satisfied that, provided we follow up in specific decisions the intention to eliminate subsidies in the nationalisedenergy industries, the total saving should exceed the target set by theEconomic Strategy Committee of saving at least  100 million a year on thebalance of payments.    Looking forward, our aim over the next few years isto save 10 per cent of our total energy consumption.    If this were achievedit would amount to  700 million on our oil import bill.    The bulk of this willhave to come - as the  150 million already saved has come * from thedecisions of individual consumers helped and advised by the Government as necessary.    This is a task in which my Advisory Council will have a significant part to play.4.        The main issues which were in dispute in our earlier discussion were:-
i. Lead content of petrolI would have preferred a reversal of the step taken lowering the lead content in petrol from 1 November 1974.    I believe that themedical evidence for reduction is not conclusive and in view of thecost to the balance of payments ( 13 million a year), I would have preferred to return to our earlier standard, believing that this woulddemonstrate our resolve in the drive to conserve energy.    However,I have accepted my colleagues&apos; view that it might cause difficultyboth politically and practically.    We are in any event agreed that further reductions in lead content should be deferred pending a/ thorough review of the medical and economic implications involved\   in proceeding with the programme.ii. Speed limits the proposals in the statement - no change on motorways, 60 mphon dual carriageways, 50 mph on single carriageways - have beenagreed with the Minister for Transport.    These limits can be supported by road safety arguments and by consideration of publicacceptability over an extended period.    They will offer some saving in imports (possibly of the broad order to  10 million a year) but themain benefits to fuel saving will be psychological,5.        As compared with my earlier proposals I have toughened up thestatement on two points :-a. First, I now propose to use the powers contained in the fuel and Electricity (Control) Act to impose maximum heating standardson all buildings other than living accommodation.    I would of course,also provide blanket exemptions for the sick and disabled, for young children, the aged and for preserving materials and equipment,b. Second, I propose similarly to use statutory powers to prohibit floodlighting of buildings, statues, bridges, etc at all times and to restrict electricity for external advertising and externaldisplay lighting during daylight hours.    Both restrictions would comeinto force in the New Year,6, Neither move will make much difference to energy supplies - theformer, even as a voluntary scheme, is largely self-enforcing and thelatter represents a very minor use of electricity.    Nevertheless, both movesreflect a public mood and will carry conviction.7.        At the Chequers meeting on Government strategy, I was asked toexamine urgently the question of a two-tier price system for petrol with a low-priced nation and a high price for further supplies.    Work on this is inhand interdepartmentally but the issues are complex and it is in any case
clear that we could not introduce such a scheme, as a going concern, forsome months.    I will bring a paper to my colleagues as soon as possible but believe firmly that the present statement should not be delayed while we make up our minds on further steps.    In the meantime I would propose tosay, if asked, that the possibility of a scheme of this kind is underconsideration.    I could also, if my colleagues wished, refer specifically tothe scheme in the statement as being a possibility under consideration.8.        I invite my colleagues:-:.y   a.        To agree to the proposed public stand on lead in petrol.b. To agree to the proposed new speed limits.c. To agree that statutory powers should be used to setmaximum heating standards in industria!and commercial premises.1 . i 1 &apos;    -      &apos;&apos;: -   //&apos; - &apos;d. To agree that conspicuous forms of public lighting should be restricted in the way proposed.e. To decide whether a reference to the possibility of a two-tier price system for petrol should be included in my statement.f. To endorse my statement generally and to approve its earlydelivery to the House,tf : &apos; -^&apos;) I-/     &apos; &apos; Kf&amp;i &apos; &apos;:BiE G V Department of Energy2 December 19743
ANNEXENERGY SAVING:    DRAFT statement with permission Mr Speaker I would like to make a. statement onenergy saving.2      As the House knows our import hill for oil this year is likelyto exceed  34.billion.   By the end of the present decade we should no longer be net importers of energy.   We are the only major industrial country in the Western World which has this prospect.3      Despite this the need to reduce our import bill is acute.k      Progress has of course already been made.    It is estimated forexample that voluntary conservation measures this year have alreadysaved about 2% of our normal energy consumption - worth about  150million at current import prices.5 These savings are a good beginning. But we need to do muchmore in the years ahead. //&quot;,6     My rt Hon Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, made it plain in his budget statement that the Government intends to enstirethat energy prices are brought as quickly as possible to a level whichreflects true costs.    The best advice we have is that a move to suchprices might save at least  50 million - and perhaps a good deal more -on our import bill in a full year.7      To rely on the price mechanism alone however is not enough.   TheGovernment have therefore considered what further steps,it can take to reinforce the pressures of price.8      My Advisory Council of Energy Conservation has already produced a number of suggestions for the Government to consider and its workvail grow and develop over the months and years ahead.   The measures and proposals I announce today therefore must be regarded as an interimpackage.9      The measures the Government has decided to adopt now are:-Eirst: To introduce a loan scheme which will provide a source of finance for energy saving investment in industry, to ensurethat such investments are not held back by cash flow problems.Loans will be at favourable rates of interest. Any expenditurein this financial year will be covered by a late springsupplementary. I expect to make available  3m a year for thispurpose.   Full details of the scheme will be announced shortly.Second:    The Government will use its powers to ensure that thenext round of oil price increases bears more heavily on motor spirit than on other oil products.   This move will seek further to discourage imports of motor spirit and crude oil used toproduce motor spirit, which currently cost us about  500m a year.Details will be announced when the Price Commission has finished1
its work on the present round of company applications for price increases.   /f&quot;The House will also wish to know that the Governmentare considering the possibility of introducing a two-tier pricesystem for petrol with a basic ration available at one price and additional supplies available at much higher prices.   I would welcome views on this proposition/7Third:    The Government has reviewed the programme for reducingthe lead content of petrol.    The reduction which took effect on1 November has added more than  10m a year to our import bill andfurther stages of the programme could be very much more expensivethan this.   Ve do not intend.to go back on what has been done sofar but have decided that further progress should be deferred until a thorough review of all the medical and economic implications of proceeding with the programme has been undertaken.. .. /,:     /.; :\&apos;&quot;;&apos;.%  % t       :. .....   &apos; &apos; wFourth:    About 3 million tons of,&apos;coal equivalent a year is usedin Government, civil and defence buildings.    The Property ServicesAgency are planning to spend up to.  5m a year over the next fewyears on improved control equipment, draught proofing and additionalinsulation.    These and other measures aim to achieve eventuallysavings of around  20m a year or more than 20% of current expenditure in this area.Fifth:    Public authorities other than Government, for example,local authorities, use some 17 million tons of coal equivalent ayear.   And a further 20 million tons is estimated to be used in public sector housing.    The Government are opening urgentdiscussions with local authorities and others concerned to see howfar and in what ways savings can be achieved in this important areaof our life.Sixth: Speed Limits: excessive speed wastes petrol, as well ascosting lives. The Government have therefore decided; to reducethe maximum speed limits on single carriageway roads to 50 mphand on dual carriageways other than motorways to 60 mph. Speedlimits on motorways will remain unchanged. My right Hon friend the Minister of Transport will make a further statement on thislater today.Seventh:    Sir we will introduce compulsory limits on heating levels in buildings other than living accommodation and a limited range of further exemptions designed to protect the young, the old, the sick, the disabled and certain types of material and equipment.These standards will involve a maximum heating level of 680F - 200G.Government offices already work to a minimum standard offi 650F and my right Hon Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment andI will be considering with the interested parties, including theNational Vhitley Council Staff Side, how savings can be secured bycloser adherence to this standard as well as by sustained savingsefforts.I have rejected imposing compulsory limits on private householdsbut savings in the home are as valuable as those elsewhere.    Iappeal for the maximum voluntary savings.2
3Eighth:&apos;   In all areas of our. national life greater attentionneeds to be focussed on the careful use of energy.   My AdvisoryCouncil has suggested that company annual reports should state the expenditure incurred on fuel and the steps taken to saveenergy.    The possibility of including this provision in future legislation is being considered.    Meanwhile Boards of Directorsshould voluntarily demonstrate their public spirit and their1goodstewardship by implementing this suggestion.Ninth:    As a corollary of eight, all Boards should make clearwithin their firms their commitment to energy saving and shouldmake someone   specifically responsible for achieving it.Tenth:    Both management and employee representatives engaged injoint consultation in industry and commerce should see that energysaving is made a regular subject for practical discussion leading to early and effective action.I have written to the CBI asking them to draw the attention of their members to these last three points, and to give them their full support;   and I have written similarly to the TUC on the important contribution which union representatives can make through jointconsultations.Eleventh:    I have decided to ban all floodlighting of buildings,statues, etc at any time and to restrict the use of electricityfor external display and advertising purposes during daylighthours.    The necessary orders for this and the proposed heatingstandards will be laid shortly and will come into effect in theNew Year.Twelfth:    Finally, to promote and reinforce action in all these areas, the Government will, over the months ahead1, develop apublicity campaign to inform and advise industry and commerce,motorists and households, on how they can help themselves and thenation by using energy more carefully and efficiently.    In addition,the heads of the nationalised fuel industries have told me that theywill co-ordinate energy saving publicity.10    Mr Speaker, it is not possible to estimate with any precision the energy savings-which may emerge from this&apos; package, not least becausemany of the effects are cumulative over time.   But there is no doubtthat substantial savings are possible.    Indeed, if we were to be ableto save, within the next few years, say, 10% of our total energyconsumption - an amount which currently costs about  700 million a yearto import - we would have made a major contribution to our nationalwellbeing and national future. ^ ..
