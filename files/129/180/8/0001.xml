ANNEXDEFENCE REVIEW:   DRAFT PARLIi^tENTARY STATEMENT1.     On 21 March I announced the start of the most extensive and thoroughreview of our system of defence ever undertaken &quot;by a British G-overnment in peacetime.2.    The proposals which I   will now outline are the result of a careful study of all the relevant considerations - defence, political, industrial andfinancial.   They are designed for the circumstances which we must expect overthe next ten years.   They take account! ,bf our economic situation:   but they also pay full regard to the threat to our national security, the overriding importance of NATO, the crucial contribution made by the United States,our position   as a leading European power and our responsibilities overseas,,They will provide for a modern and effective defence structure and willmake a significant contribution to establishing our economic health andthus to strengthening the alliance.3.    The G-overnment has decided that it can reduce defence expenditure asa proportion of GNP from its present level of 5i per cent to 42 Per cent over the next ten years.   The long range estimates of defence expenditure as they stood in March 1974 would have amounted to 6 per cent of GNP ,in1978-79 and 5? per cent in 1983-84.   By comparison with those plans, our decision will save  4-75 million a year by 1978-79 and some  750 million a year by 1983-84 - or a total over the whole period up to that date ofabout  4;30omillion,   This is fully consistent with our repeated pledges to reduce the cost of defence as a proportion of our national resources.4.    In addition to  deciding the general scale of the programme needed tomeet our future defence requirements and the level of resources we can devoteto defence, the Government has reached provisional conclusions about the forcelevels involved and the implications for our commitments, for the armed forces and for industry.   We are today/beginning our consultations with our allies in NATO.   These consultations will be thorough and genuine.   They are likelyto last into the New Year.   We have also approached our Commonwealth partnersconcerned and the other governments in other parts of the woiid who willor might be affected.1
5.     First I will describe the general principles that we have followed in conducting the review.   NATO is the linchpin of British security andwill remain the first charge on the resources available for defence.   Wetherefore propose to concentrate as a first priority upon those areas inwhich we believe that we can most effectively contribute to the securityof the Alliance and of the United Kingdom itself.   These consist of our contributions of land and air forces in the Central Region of Europe;of sea and air forces to the Eastern Atlantic and Channel Commands; and inthe defence of the United Kingdom and its immediate approaches.  We shall also maintain the effectiveness of our Polaris   force.6,    We shall, however, be discussing with our NATO allies all aspects ofour contribution, including particularly our force declarations to NATOin the Mediterranean and the specialist reinforcement forces that wecommitted to the Alliance in 1968.   In the NATO area wo propose to maintain our land and air contribution to the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force, butto reduce our other NATO force declarations to an airportable Brigade group and a Royal Marine Commando Group, with the necessary accompanying sea andair elements.   These latter declarations would be available for the CentralRegion or the Northern Flank of NATO, with the Commando Group speciallytrained and equipped for arctic warfare.-. ii    a7.     The priority wo are giving to our NATO contribution necessarily requires a contraction in our commitments outside the Alliance,,   We have reviewedthese commitments case by case, bearing particularly in mind tho decisions taken by the Labour Government in 1968 about the reduction of the Britishpresence East of Suez.  We have concluded that substantial reductions inour forces and defence facilities can be made.   But we shall not actprecipitately and we shall discuss our proposals in detail with our alliesand partners in tho Commonwealth and elsewhere before taking final decisions,recognising that the timing and method of the changes we propose may beof particular importance.IIP .8.     Subject to these provisos I wish to tell the House what we have in mind.We shall, of-course,&quot; maintain our obligations towards our remaining dependent territories.   We intend to keep our forces in Hong Kong, although we proposeto make some reductions in them and to seek from the Hong Kong Government alarger percentage of their cost when the present cost-sharing agreement runsout in 1976.   In accordance with the military facilities agreement concluded2
in 1972 with the Government of Malta 3 we shall remain there until 1979.In Cyprus3 we propose to make some early reductions, particularly in our air forces stationed there.   We propose to withdraw our forces stationedunder the Five Power Defence Agreement in South Bast Asia with the exceptionof a small group which we shall continue to contribute to the IntegratedAir Defence System,   The consultative provisions of the Five Power defence agreement would however remain in force and it would cortainly be our intention to maintain close links with the armed forces and defence authorities of our partners.   We would, of course, maintain our membership of CENTOand SEATO but without declaring specific forces to either,,   We propose towithdraw from Brunei the Gurkha Battalion at present stationed there.We would withdraw our forces from Gan and Mauritius.   We do not think itwould be right in present circumstances to make any changes in thearrangements we have with the Sultan of Oman.  We intend to&apos;enter into negotiations with the South African Government with a view to terminating the SimonstoTTn Agreement.9.    Given the effects of these decisions in the Indian Ocean area and theSoviet naval presence there, we have decided to agree . to proposals fromthe United States Government for a relatively modest expansion of thefacilities on the island of Diego Garcia v/hich they enjoy, jointly with us,under an existing agreement with Her Majesty&apos;s Government.   Their use ofthe facilities other than for routine purposes will however be a matter for joint decision of the two Governments.   Wo and the United States Governmenthave also agreed to pursue consultations with the aim of developing realisticprogress towards arms limitation in the Indian Ocean.10. In working out the implications of these principles in terms of forcelevels and their effects on the three Services, priority has been given to maintaining as far as possible the level and quality of our front-lineforces. We shall equip them in a manner commensurate with their roles and responsibilities, and restructure and reduce the support area to match thenew size and shape of the front-line. The effects of our proposals on the forward plans of the three Services as they stood in March 1974 would bo.broadly as follows.11.   The Royal navy&apos; s planned numbers of frigates, destroyers and mineccuntermeasures vessels would be reduced by about a seventh; of conventionalsubmarines by a quarter; and of afloat support by a third.   Planned new ship3
construction would be reduced &quot;by about a quarter, including the abandonment of plans to replace our amphibious ships with new purpose-built vessels;and all ship refitting would be concentrated on the Royal Dockyards, all of which will be retained.   The nuclear submarine and the cruiser programmes would be maintained.   One Royal Marine Commando would be disbanded,12.   The Amy&apos;s re-requipment plans would be substantially modified to reducethe growth of their cost.   Measures would include the cancellation of theVixen wheeled reconnaissance vehicle; withdrawal from the collaborativeRS80 project for long-range rocket artillery; and reductions in the plannedpurchases of the Gazelle reconnaissance vehicle.   We shall neverthelessensure that our troops continue to havo equipment of the standard needed for their front-line NATO taeks,Vi/V   &apos; \       o &apos;13,   The Government attaches great importance to the negotiations betweenNATO and the Warsaw Pact countries on the mutual reduction of forces and armaments in Central Europe.   We are committed to seeking an outcome which,while preserving undiminished security for all the countries concerned, would help to create a more stable relationship in the area at a lower level of forces.   We hope that the negotiations will be successful in achieving this objective,,   We do not propose, however, in advance of mutual and balanced forcereductions, to reduce the forces which we maintain in Germany in accordancewith our Brussels Treaty obligations.   In adjusting the size and shape of theArmy to meet the framework of priorities I have described and the demandsof economy, the Government will aim at a carefully planned restructuring whichwill take full account of the regimental system and the loyalties andtraditions it enshrines.   The Brigade of Gurkhas will be retained, primarily for service in Hong Kong,   Y/e shall maintain the size and roles of theTerritorial and Army Volunteer Reserve,14*   In the case of the Royal Air Force, we intend to preserve, and in somoinstances improve, the combat air forces committed to NATO on the continent and in the United Kingdom, and to continue with the MRCA collaborativeprogramme, though we may have tei make some reductions in the planned rate of deliveries over the period.   However, in accordance with the revised tasksenvisaged, the RAF transport force would be progressively reduced by a halfand tho planned helicopter force by a quarter.   Some reduction would also bemade in maritimo patrol aircraft and in the RAF Regiment; and some twelve RAFStations in the United Kingdom would be closed,
15.   We shall reduce planned expenditure on research and development by some10 per cent and continue vigorously to support the efforts being made vtfithinthe Alliance to increase standardisation in equipment and eliminate duplicationin research and development.16,   Our proposals would involve reducing the plans as they stood last Marchby about 40,000 Servicemen and about 30,000 directly employed civilians,including some 11,000 civilians locally entered abroad,,   The reductions on present Service strengths may be expected to be rather lessc   In the interestsof efficiency, and equally of the well-being and morale of the forcesthemselves, the changes we propose will be carefully planned and introducedprogressively over the next few years,., Reductions will be achieved by normalwastage as far as possible; but some redundancies, both Service and civilian,will bo unavoidable if the Services and the headquarters and&apos;outstations ofthe Ministry of Defence are to be adapted to the new range of commitments,and if the balance of ranks and ago necessary for a satisfactory careerstructure is to be preserved.   Those who have to be made redundant will be offered fair terms, and time in which to plan their future employment.   Weshall be examining ways in which the Government can help with resettlementinto civilian life.17.   The reductions in the planned defence programme are likely to reduceemployment in the defence industries by only some 10,000 or 4 per cent overthe period up to 1978-79 but there will be problems in certain areas and forcertain firms.   But the changes in our equipment programme will bo made assmoothly as possible and.7ri.th the maximum of notice to enable industry to adjust its plans.   I am confident that these problems are manageable; andI am in close touch with my R.t Hon Friends, the Secretary of State for employment and the Secretary of State for Industry, on these aspects of the review.18,   Early next year, when our consultations have been concluded, I willpublish for parliamentary consideration a White Paper setting out our decisions in detail and saying how they are to be put into effect.   But before this we wish not only to consult our allies and partners but to learn the views ofRt Hon and Hon Members upon these matters; and the G-overnment will be readyJo arrange through the usual channels for an early debate.5
19.   Our decisions will save  V75 million a year by 1978-79 an(i some 750 million a year by 198J5-84.   But in conclusion I wish to emphasise one point.   No such process of adaptation by the Armed Forces, or any otherorganisation, to a modified range of commitments and capabilities with a lower level of resources can be made without difficulty.   But after we have completed the process of consultations on this thorough and wide-rangingreview, and taken our final decisions, I am confident that Britain willcontinue to play her full part in preserving the strategy and cohesionof the NATO Alliance, and in meeting effectively her remaining commitmentsoutside NATO.   The Royal Navy, the Army, and the Royal Air Force willremain highly effective forces, equipped to the highest standards; and making, will continue to offer a wide range of fine career opportunitiesin the years ahead. &apos;1the Services and the Ministry of Defence, despite the changes we will bew11Cabinet Office18 November 19746
