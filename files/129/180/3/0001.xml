HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 1285 November, 1974CABINETBILL TO AMEND THE TRADE UNION ANDLABOUR RELATIONS ACT 1974Memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment. My colleagues on the Committee on Economic Policy have discussed at length the provision in this Bill which repeals the section of the TradeUnion and Labour Relations Act 1974 dealing with1 rights of appeal for individuals unreasonably expelled or excluded from trade unions in aclosed shop situation and which substitutes a more satisfactory provisionfor appeal to a special tribunal.    The Trades Union Congress (TUC)have always been opposed to any statutory provision in this matter, andit was in order to allow more time for discussion with them that wedropped the relevant provision from the Trade Union and Labour relations act.2.        During the passage of the Act I made it clear in the House ofCommons that we believed some action was necessary, whether bymeans of a provision in the Employment Protection Bill or throughaction by the TUC itself.3.        Accordingly, when we began to prepare proposals for theEmployment Protection Bill, I wrote to the TUC making it clear thatwhile the Government were resolved to repeal the unsatisfactoryprovisions in the 1974 Act, they believed that something must be put inits place.    I then offered the TUC two alternatives - either a statutoryappeals procedure, or the establishment of appeals machinery on a voluntary basis, under TUC auspices without any statutory provision.I append extracts from my letter to the TUC posing these two alternativesand setting out the kind of voluntary machinery we had in mind if the TUCwere prepared to adopt that course.4.        In my discussions with the TUC up to now, they have continued to criticise strongly our proposals for a statutory appeals procedure but havenot come forward with proposals for voluntary machinery of their own.However, at a meeting which I had with members of the TUC Finance andGeneral Purposes Committee on 4 November, the TUC representativesfaced with a proposal for a statutory provision which met the maincriticisms they had so far made, finally declared their willingness to makea firm recommendation to the General Council to adopt voluntary appeals&apos; 1        &apos; . V. .&quot;-        &apos;CONFIDENTIALCOPY NO
machinery on the lines proposed in my letter (the relevant extract ofwhich appears in the Annex).    They are confident that the general council would accept and act on their recommendation.    I hope to have,before my colleagues discuss this, a letter from the TUC setting this out.5,        During the debates on the Trade Union and. Labour Relations Act, Ioften suggested that if the unions could make effective provision them-selves, this would be a satisfactory substitute for a statutory procedure which did not command their support and which might therefore contain theseeds of great difficulties and possible confrontations in the future.6.        Provided we can be sure that the TUC will in fact take promp action to establish their own machinery on the lines set out in my letter, Ibelieve we should drop the provision for a Statutory procedure which now appears in the Bill,7.        My proposal is that on the basis of the offer, by the TUC, we should confine the Bill to a straight repeal of the relevant provision of the 1974 Act.We should tell, the TUC that we should need a firm decision by the general council by the end of this month and an assurance that they would establishvoluntary machinery without delay.    We should make it clear to the tuc and in Parliament that if voluntary action by the TUC does not materialise,we must reserve the right to introduce a legislative provision,8.        I invite my colleagues to agree to this course, which would allow usto proceed with the introduction of the Bill without loss of time.M department of employment November 19742
(confidential)ANNEXEXTRACTS FROM LETTER AND ENCLOSURE OF 15 OCTOBER 1974 FROM-..SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT TO MR LEN MURRAY(i)    Letter&quot;Safeguards for union members jiI accept of course that Section 5 of the Act as drafted is completely defective and its use by disgruntled union members might cause problems.    On the; other hand,  I have already made clear inParliament my view that there is a need to provide some alternative safeguard against arbitrary exclusion or expulsionfrom union membership, whether by statutory or voluntary means.I therefore see very great difficulty in repealing Section 5 inthe short Bill without putting something concrete in its place.There seem to me to be&apos; two possibilities .    The first, whichI would much prefer,   is to delete Section 5 and to replace it witha new provision on the lines recommended by the Donovan Commissionand proposed by the Government when the Trade Union and labour relations Bill was being drafted.    The second is voluntary action by the TUC which would include the setting up of1a new body towhich aggrieved individuals could appeal if dissatisfied with theresults of their internal union procedures.    This would presentgreater difficulties  from my point of view but I am sure theGovernment would be very ready to consider it if the TUC expressed a strong preference for it.    The two alternatives are set out more fully in the attached note,  on i&apos;/hich I would welcome the general council&apos;s views.&quot;(ii) Enclosure /(  See Over )(confidential)
&quot;Voluntary approach11        Aril alternative to a statutory provision would be a voluntary move by the TUC itself.    The nature of this wouldbe for the TUC to consider,  but possible steps might be:-(i)      The TUC could up-date and reaffirm their 1969guidance to affiliated unions;(ii)      the TUC could undertake to follow up with unions to encourage conformity with TUC standards;(iii)      the TUC could arrange for a small conciliationcommittee to which individuals aggrieved byexpulsion or exclusion in a closed shop situation could apply if they were still dissatisfied aftergoing through all internal .union procedures;(iv)      this committee  could make recommendations forsettlements which affiliated unions would undertaketo accept.    Alternatively,  the committee could have no powers but would discuss the case withthe union and the/individual concerned and would use its best endeavours to bring about an agreed settlement;(v)      the conciliation committee might be headed by anindependent person eg from the CAS panel ofarbitrators.&quot;CONFIDENTIAL
