ANNEXDEFENCE REVIEW: DRAFT PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT1. Mr Speaker this statement will be somewhat longer than is normalat this hour.    I apologise for this but I am sure that the House willacknowledge the importance of the issue.2. On 21 March I announced the start of the most extensive and thoroughreview of our system of defence ever undertaken by a British Governmentin peacetime.    The proposals which I will now outline are the result of a careful study of all the relevant considerations - defence, political,industrial and financial.    They are designed for the circumstances whichwe must expect over the next ten years.    They take account of our economic situation: but they also pay full regard to the [threat to our national security, the overriding importance of NATO, our position as a leading European power and our responsibilities overseas.    They willprovide for a modern and effective defence structure and will make a significant contribution to establishing our economic health and thus to strengthening the alliance.3.        The Government has decided that it can reduce defence expenditure as a proportion of GNP from its present level of 5j per cent to 4-f per cent over the next ten years.    The long range estimates of defence expenditure as they stood in March 1974 would have amounted to 6 per cent of GNPin 1978-79 and 5j per cent in 1983-84.    By comparison with those plans,our decision will save  300 million in 1975-76,  475 million a year by1978-79 and some  750 million a year by 1983-84 - or a total over the whole period up to that date of about  4, 600 million.    This is fully consistent with our repeated pledges to reduce the cost of defence as a proportion ofour national resources.4.        In addition to deciding the general scale of the programme needed to meet our future defence requirements and the level of resources we candevote to defence, the Government has reached provisional conclusionsabout the force levels involved and the implications for our commitments,for the armed forces and for industry.    We are today beginning ourconsultations with our allies in NATO.    These consultations will bethorough and genuine.    They are likely to last into the New Year.    Weare also consulting our Commonwealth partners concerned and the otherGovernments in other parts of the world who will or might be affected.We shall also now consult both sides of industry.5.        First I will describe the general principles that we have followed inconducting the review.    NATO is the linchpin of British security and willremain the first charge on the resources available for defence.    Wetherefore propose to concentrate as a first priority upon those areas inwhich we believe that we can most effectively contribute to the security of1
the Alliance and of the United Kingdom itself.    These consist of our contributions of land and air forces in the Central Region of Europe; of sea and air forces to the Eastern Atlantic and Channel areas; and in thedefence of the United Kingdom audits immediate approaches.    We shall also maintain the effectiveness of our Polaris force.6.        We shall, however, be discussing with our NATO allies all aspects of our contribution, including particularly our force declarationsto NATO in the Mediterranean and the specialist reinforcement forces thatwe committed to the Alliance in 1968.    In the NATO area we propose tomaintain our land and air contribution to the Allied Command EuropeMobile Force, but to reduce our other NATO declarations of specialisedreinforcement forces to an airportable Brigade Group and a Royal MarineCommando Group, with the necessary accompanying sea and air elements.These latter declarations would be available for the Central Region or theNorthern Flank of NATO, with the Commando Group specially trained and equipped for arctic warfare,ii8,        The priority we are giving to our NATO contribution necessarilyrequires a contraction in our commitments outside the Alliance,    We have reviewed these commitments case by case, bearing particularly in mind the decisions taken by the Labour Government in 1968 about the reductionof the British presence East of Suez,    We have concluded that substantial reductions in our forces and defence facilities can be made.    But we shallnot act precipitately and we shall discuss our proposals in detail with our allies and partners in the Commonwealth and elsewhere before taking final decisions, recognising that the timing and method of the changes we propose may be of particular importance,8.        Subject to these provisos I wish to tell the House what we have inmind.    We shall, of course, maintain our obligations towards ourremaining dependent territories.    We intend to keep our forces in hong Kong, although we propose to make some reductions in them and to seek from the Hong Kong Government a larger percentage of their costwhen the present cost-sharing agreement runs out in 1976,    In accordancewith the military facilities agreement concluded in 1972 with the Governmentof Malta, we shall remain there until 1979.    In Cyprus, we propose tomake some early reductions, particularly in our air forces stationed there.We propose to withdraw our forces stationed under the Five Power defence agreement in South East Asia with the exception of a small group which weshall continue to contribute to the Integrated Air Defence System.    the consultative provision of the Five Power Defence Agreement would howeverremain in force and it would certainly be our intention to maintain closelinks with the armed forces and defence authorities of our partners.    Wewould, of course, maintain our membership of CENTO and SEATO but without declaring specific forces to either.    We propose to withdraw fromBrunei the Gurkha Battalion at present stationed there.    We would with drawour forces from Gan and Mauritius,    We do not think it would be right in2
present circumstances to make any changes in the arrangements we have with the Sultan of Oman.    We intend to enter into negotiations with theSouth African Government with a view to terminating the simonstown agreement.9.        Given the effects of these decisions in the Indian Ocean area andthe Soviet naval presence there, we have decided to agree to proposals from the United States Government for a relatively modest expansion ofthe facilities on the island of Diego Garcia which they enjoy, jointly with us, under an existing agreement with Her Majestyrs Government.    their use of the facilities other than for routine purposes will however be amatter for joint decision of the two Governments.    We and the UnitedStates Government have also agreed to pursue consultations with the aim off developing realistic progress towards arms limitation in the Indian Ocean.10.       In working out the implications of these principles in terms of force levels and their effects on the three Services, priority has beengiven to maintaining as far as possible the level and quality of our front-line forces.    We shall equip them in a manner commensurate with theirroles and responsibilities, and restructure and reduce the support area to match the new size and shape of the front-line.    The effects of our proposals on the forward plans of the three Services as they stood inMarch 1974 would be broadly as follows.11,        The Royal Navy&apos;s planned numbers of frigates, destroyers andmine countermeasures vessels would be reduced by about a seventh;  ofconventional submarines by a quarter;  and of afloat support by a third.Planned new ship construction -would be reduced accordinglyincluding theabandonment of plans to replace our amphibious ships with new purpose-built vessels;  and all ship refitting would be concentrated on the royal dockyards, all of which will be retained.    The nuclear submarine andthe cruiser programmes would be maintained.   We would reduce thenumbers of the Royal Marines by one-seventh, disbanding one Commandoin due course.12.       The Army&apos;s re-equipment plans would be substantially modified to reduce the growth of their cost.    Measures would include the cancellation of the Vixen wheeled reconnaissance vehicle;  withdrawal fromthe collaborative RS80 project for long-range rocket artillery; and reductions in the planned purchases of light helicopters and reconnaissancevehicles./13.        The Government attaches great importance to the negotiations between NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries on the mutual reduction for rces and armaments in Central Europe.    We are committed to seekingan outcome which, while preserving undiminished security for all thecountries concerned, would help to create a more stable relationship inthe area at a lower level of forces.    We hope that the negotiations will be
successful in achieving this objective.    We do not propose, however, inadvance of mutual and balanced force reductions, to reduce the forces which we maintain in Germany in accordance with our Brussels treaty obligations.    In adjusting the size and shape of the Army to meet the framework of priorities I have described and the demands of economy, theGovernment will make every effort to avoid a significant impact on theregimental system with its historic loyalties and traditions.    The brigade of Gurkhas will be retained, mainly serving in Hong Kong.    We shallmaintain the size and roles of the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve.14,       In the case of the Royal Air Force, we intend to preserve, and insome instances improve, the combat air forces committed to NATO on theContinent and in the United Kingdom, and to continue with the MRCAcollaborative programme, though we may have to make a reduction in the planned rate of deliveries over the period.   However, in/accordance withthe revised tasks envisaged there would be some reduction in maritimepatrol aircraft, the RAF transport force would be progressively reduced bya half; and the planned helicopter force by a quarter.    There would alsobe some reduction in the RAF Regiment;  and some twelve RAF Stations inthe United Kingdom would be closed.15.       We shall reduce planned expenditure on research and development by some 10 per cent and continue vigorously to support the efforts beingmade within the Alliance to increase standardisation in equipment andeliminate duplication in research and development.16.       Our proposals would involve reducing manpower by about 35, 000Servicemen as compared with the strength in April this year; and by about30, 000 directly employed civilians, about half of whom would be civilianslocally entered abroad.    In the interests of efficiency, and equally of thewell-being and morale of the forces themselves, the changes we proposewill be carefully planned and introduced progressively over the next fewyears.    Reductions will be achieved by normal wastage as far as possible;but some redundancies, both Service and civilian, will be unavoidable if th Services and the headquarters and outstations of the Ministry of Defenceare to be adapted to the new range of commitments, and if the balance ofranks and ages necessary for a satisfactory career structure is to be preserved.    Those who have to be made redundant will be offered fairterms, and time in which to plan their future employment.    We shall beexamining ways in which the Government can help with resettlement intocivilian life,17.       The reductions in the planned defence programme are likely toreduce employment in the defence industries by only some 10, 000 or4 per cent over the period up to 1978-79 but there will be problems incertain areas and for certain firms.    But the changes in our equipment programme will be made as smoothly as possible and with the maximum of notice to enable industry to adjust its plans.    I am confident that these4
problems are manageable;  and I am in close touch with my Rt Hon Friends,the Secretary of State for Employment and the Secretary of State for industry, on these aspects of the review. , The views of both sides ofindustry will of course be taken fully into consideration.18.       Our decisions will, I repeat, save  300 million in 1975-76, 475 million a year by 1978-79 and some  750 million a year by 1983-84.But in conclusion I wish to emphasise one point.    No such process ofadaptation by the Armed Forces, or any other organisation, to a modified range of commitments and capabilities with a lower level of resources can be made without difficulty.    But after we have completed the process of consultations on this thorough and wide-ranging review,and taken our final decisions, I am confident that Britain will continue toplay her full part in preserving the strategy and cohesion of the NATOAlliance, and in meeting effectively her remaining commitments outsideNATO.    The Royal Navy, the Army, and the Royal Air Force will remainhighly effective forces, equipped to the highest standards as required bytheir front-line NATO tasks; and the Services and the Ministry of Defence,despite the changes we will be making, will continue to offer a wide range of fine career opportunities in the years ahead.19.       Early next year, when our consultations with our allies have been concluded, I will publish for Parliamentary consideration a White paper setting out our decisions in detail and saying how they are to be put intoeffect.    But before this we wish not only to consult our allies and partnersbut to learn the views of Rt Hon and Hon Members upon, these matters; andthe Government will be ready to arrange through the usual,channels for anearly debate.21 November 19745
