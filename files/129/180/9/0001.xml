DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74t134 &apos;        : COPY NO   3019 November 1974CABINETMINISTERIAL salaries memorandum by the Prime Minister1. At our second meeting after the Election (CC(74) 38th Conclusions,Minute 4) the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protectionsuggested that, in order to strengthen the social contract, consideration should be given to a possible cut in Ministerial salaries, as a way ofgiving a lead to other recipients of high salaries.    It was recognisedthat such a lead should be aimed primarily at those earning salarieshigher than those of Cabinet Ministers, in many cases in private industry with capital and lavish expense accounts behind them, rather, than thosein the  7, 000 to  10, 000 range.    We did not discuss the context.orcontexts in which a cut in Ministerial salaries could best be used to give such a lead.    At the strategy meeting at Chequers on 17 November theSecretary of State&apos;s proposal was raised again by another colleague.2. The present levels of Ministerial salaries are those recommendedby the Review Body on Top Salaries in their first report (Cmnd. 4836), andcame into payment from 1 April 1972.    They are:-Prime MinisterCabinet Minister(and Mr. Speaker)Minister not in the Cabinet(including Minister of State)Parliamentary secretary lord Chancellor /Attorney GeneralSolicitor GeneralLord AdvocateSolicitor General for ScotlandChief Whip, House of Commons 9, 500 20, 00013,0007,500 - ,,9, 5005, 50020, 00014,50011,00011,0007,750

The same report recommended an increase to  4, 500 in the salary of non-ministerial Members of Parliament, which came intoeffect on 1 January 1972.5. Since April 1972 the retail price index has risen by 31.6 per cent(to September 1974) and the index of average earnings has risen by41,3 per cent (to August 1974).6. The decision to commission the Review Body&apos;s first report on the remuneration of Ministers and Members of Parliament was announced on 4 December 1970.    The reference to the Review Body was made inMay 1971, and the report was published in December 1971.    In that report the Review Body said that they considered that there should be a major comprehensive review of these salaries at intervals of four years(i.e. corresponding roughly to once in the lifetime of each Parliamentof normal length); that was not intended to preclude the possibility of intermediate adjustments.rp . ..7. We are committed to referring the remuneration of Members ofParliament to the Review Body for a further review in January 1975.The normal course would be to ask the Review Body to considerMinisterial salaries at the same time.    (It can review ministerial salaries only if specifically asked by the Government to do so.)   Wecould, if we wished, deliberatel y refrain from including ministerial salaries in the reference, though the arguments against doing so, in aperiod of severe inflation, are self-evident, and we have to bear in mind the position of junior Ministers as well as our own.5, 0004, 5004, 0009, 5003, 5007, 500:;! k\2,500
8. It would be illogical to cut Ministerial salaries and simultaneously to refer them to the Review Body.    If therefore we want to make a gesture of Ministerial salaries in the next few weeks, we have a choice between two courses of action: -i.       not to refer Ministerial salaries to the Review Bodywhen we refer remuneration of Members of Parliament;ii. not only not to refrain from referring ministerial salaries to the Review Body, but also to announce that Ministers have agreed to forgo a certainproportion of their salaries for a specified period. uI/9. If we decided not to reduce Ministerial salaries now, and to referthem to the Review Body together with the remuneration of Members ofParliament, another opportunity to consider making a gesture on ministerial salaries would arise when the Review Body reported and wehad to decide what to do about its recommendations: for instance, we might agree not to draw a part or the whole of any increases the review body recommended for Cabinet Ministers.    In referring ministerial salaries to the Review Body we could say that we thought it right that the review Body should look at the whole picture while it was about it, butthat we might well think it right when the time came to postpone action onits recommendations in respect of our own (Cabinet Ministers&apos;) salaries.10.       As I said when, we discussed this in Cabinet, I have tended to regard cuts in Ministerial salaries as gimmicks when they have beensuggested in the past, and I have been doubtful whether as gestures theyreally impress very much those whom they are intended to impress.It may be that in present circumstances such a   gesture would have more to commend it, as a sprat to catch a mackerel, in that it would have a bearing on other top salaries in the public sector, and thus indirectly(and in my view more importantly) on top salaries in the private sector,which have a provocative   effect when wage claims are put forward.    Butit is clear that a gesture of this kind cannot be made more than once inthe lifetime of a Government, and if it is made is likely to store up futuredifficulty when the time comes to restore Ministerial salaries to the rightlevel.    So, if we are to make any gesture of this kind, we must make sure that we do not waste it, or by using it prematurely deprive ourselves ofits benefits when it might in political terms be of greatest advantage to us.11.       We should now clear our minds on this in relation to two forth-coming events:-i.       The Lord President will in due course have to announce the reference of Members of Parliaments1 remuneration to the review Body.    Is that reference to cover Ministerial salariesas well?
ii.       The Cabinet will shortly be asked to take decisions onthe Review Body&apos;s recommendations on top salaries in thepublic services - senior civil servants, senior officers inthe Armed Forces, the judiciary, and chairmen and board members of nationalised industries.    Before we considerthe various courses open to us for dealing with those recommendations we should know where we stand on ministerial salaries.12.       On Ministerial salaries we need to decide between three courses:-i.       To forgo a certain proportion of our (Cabinet Ministers&apos;)salaries for a specified period, and to refrain from referringMinisterial salaries to the Review Body when we refer the remuneration of members of Parliament. &apos;i 1ii.       Not to reduce Ministerial salaries, but not to refer themto the Review Body with the remuneration of Members of ii&apos;Parliament.iii.       Not to reduce Ministerial salaries, and to includeMinisterial salaries together with the remuneration of Membersof Parliament in the reference to the Review Body - retainingour freedom not to act, or to postpone action, on its recommendations.v&quot;::v.w &apos;, - &apos; .:. -\K . M&apos;:. -      7 H:0-yIf we decided on the first course, we should need to consider further theamount to be forgone;  the period for which it was to be forgone; and theconsequentials (if any) for other Ministerial salaries; but those questions would need to be considered in the context of our discussion in due course of the Review Body&apos;s recommendations for top salaries in thepublic services.H W10 Downing Street19 November 1974
