DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S government(74) 144 4 81COPY no December, 1974CABINETNATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CONSULTANTS:NEW CONTRACT PROPOSALSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The proposals by the Secretary of State for Social Services for new contracts for National Health Service (NHS) consultants (C(74) 143)have very difficult implications for incomes policy and for public expenditure.INCOMES policy . The double objective of phasing out private beds and getting moreconsultants to commit themselves wholly to the NHS involves paying more in real terms for the same amount of work:  for example, a whole-timeNHS consultant who now gets just over  9, 500 would get just over 14, 000 for no extra effort or responsibility.    And this is at 1974 levels;the Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Review Body might well award something around20 per cent anyway from next April for the 1975 pay review.    It will beseen that these proposals go some way beyond simply compensating thoseconsultants who give up private practice for the loss of that income -hence, to some extent, the extra cost.3. Extra pay of this order can be expected to have repercussionswithin the NHS on General Practitioners and Junior Hospital Doctors atthe very least.    Moreover, increases on this scale for the relativelyhighly paid would be outside the Trades Union Congress (TUC) guidelineson pay; it cannot credibly be argued that the reference in the guidelinesto restructuring is meant to accommodate this sort of thing.4. Some features of these proposals could have repercussions outsidethe Health Service; for example, they could encourage demands for overtime payments by public sector staff who do not get  them now, even atsalary levels considerably below those of consultants.5. There is also the position of the Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; review body.    It is dangerous, and has implications for the whole Review Bodysystem, to depart from the principle that it is they, rather than theGovernment, who deal with actual pay levels in this area, merely becausethe consultants are in a strong negotiating position and are prepared to bemilitant.
6. There is also the risk of pre-empting the decisions we have totake on top salaries.PUBLIC expenditure.        If adopted, the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals would also raise asubstantial issue of public expenditure.   Their immediate cost, previouslyestimated at  20 million and now at  17 million a year, would in practiceamount to an equivalent addition to the total expenditure at constant priceson the NHS (as distinct from &quot;straight&quot;; pay increases for which the doctors have been promised the necessary extra finance).    No account wastaken of this in the Cabinefs decisions on 25 November on expenditure and priorities and allocations to individual programmes.&apos;    The whole of theadditional expenditure entailed in the present proposals thereforerepresents a new view of NHS priorities, and would need to be accommodated within the overall limits for expenditure set by the Cabinet.    This wouldhave to be done by one or more of three means - by offsetting reductions to expenditure within the health programme as decided on 25 November;by offsetting reductions to other programmes; or by Ichargsng it to the contingency Reserve for each year, thereby reducing availability of thatreserve for all other purposes.    The Secretary of State offers to accommodate by the first of these methods that element of the cost,estimated at not more than  5 million, which is expected to result fromconsultants opting to work full-time in the NHS instead of part-time, andfrom acceptance by consultants generally of extra obligations.    Sheproposes that the remaining  12 - 15 million a year of the immediate cost should be found from the Contingency Reserve - ie that potential claims onthe Contingency Reserve for all programmes should be foregone to the same extent.8. These figures leave out of account the further cost of at least 20 million a year which would arise from phasing out pay beds themselves,in consequence of the loss of income from charges for these beds.    they also leave out of account the cost of repercussions on pay elsewhere in thepublic sector of the present proposals, which cannot at present bequantified, but could be large.CONCLUSION .9. I sympathise with the Secretary of State&apos;s objectives.    But by seeking to achieve them in this way we risk paying too much and prejudicingour wider policies.   The public will think that the main beneficiaries arethe consultants, not the sick.    We must consider very seriously the implications for the Social Contract and the TUC guidelines.    And even ifwe conclude that they can be accepted, I must ask my colleagues to considerwhether the expenditure consequences are acceptable also, and to what extent they should be offset from within the expenditure programme for the nhs rather than the Contingency Reserve.D treasury Chambers4 December 1974 2
