DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74)141 COPY NO   J Q3 December 1974&quot;j, &apos; v 1CABINETREPORT OF THE TOP SALARIES REVIEW BODYMemorandum by the Prime Minister1. The Review Body on Top Salaries (TSRB) (the Chairman of which isLord Boyle) has now submitted its substantive report on top salaries in thepviblic services: senior civil servants, senior officers in the armed forces, the judiciary and the chairmen and board members of nationalised industries. I enclose a copy of a memorandum by officials setting out the background, and listing and discussing the recommendations and various possible courses of action. Copies of the Review Body&apos;s Report are being circulated separately,2.        The memorandum by officials lists three options:i, to accept and implement the report as it stands;ii, to accept the report but stage the increases;iii, to reject the report and substitute smaller increases.There is a fourth option:iv, to reject the report and make no increases, or differentincreases at a later date.3,        There are strong arguments, to which we should givei due weight,for accepting and implementing the report as it stands.    The Review Bodysystem represents a bargain between the Government and those servants ofthe State who come within the system, into which both sides have enteredfor mutual advantage and protection.   The bargain depends upon theassumption that the Government will honour the Review Body&apos;srecommendations: indeed, there is a commitment on the Government toaccept recommendations of the Review Bodies unless there are clear andcompelling reasons for not doing so.    The TSRB&apos;s Report, firstcommissioned in 1971, represents the first substantive review of the salaries concerned since July 1969 (though there have been interim increases1SECRET
in the meantime).    If the recommendations are implemented, the increases since 1969 (64 per cent overall, or 9.4 per cent a year) will bevery much less than the increase in average earnings (105 per cent, or14,1 per cent a year) or average salaries (98 per cent, or 13.2 per cent a year); and less in almost all cases than increases in comparableoutside earnings over the same period.    Those concerned would no doubtregard it as unfair if we rejected or modified on grounds of redistributionpolicy recommendations which the Review Body explicitly describes asleaving them in January 1975 in. a relatively worse position than in 1969;they would argue - and they would be able to quote the Review Body insupport of this view - that redistribution policy should be effected by measures of general application, such as taxation, not by discrimination against the public services in determining salaries.    We are pledged notto discriminate against the public sector, and not to retreat from theprinciple of fair comparison as the basis for settling the pay of the CivilService.    We have not formulated^ still less agreed, a &quot;high pay policy&quot;by reference to which we might seek to override these pledges.    Thereare also arguments of recruitment, retention and morale in relation to allthe groups of people concerned, which support acceptance andimplementation.    The arguments vary in detail from group to group, andit is not necessary to rehearse them in this memorandum,4,        On the other hand we have to assess the effect upon the social contract of implementing the recommendations in full from the due dates.Whatever the arguments for accepting the increases recommended;increases of the absolute size proposed at these high income levels wouldbe likely to make it more difficult to secure restraint at lower income levels.    This problem is especially acute in relation to the possibleimpact of the increases proposed for chairmen and board members of nationalised industries on negotiations on the pay of those who are employedin those industries.5,        For the future, I believe that these public sector salaries will haveto be reviewed every year.    Quite apart from the interests of those concerned, there is the fact that, because these salaries have been reviewed relatively infrequently, we and other Governments have beenfaced time after time with embarrassingly large increases because of theneed to catch up with three or four years&apos; movement in the private sector.Whatever we do now, we should in my view try to avoid recreating this problem in a year&apos;s time.6,        There are problems of &quot;compression&quot; - narrowing of differentials -to which the memorandum by officials refers.    The most crucial of these is in the Civil Service, where the gap between the top of the assistant secretary scale (at present  8, 850) and the Under-Secretary rate (at present 9, 000) is only  150 and the Assistant Secretary scale will rise furtherfrom 1 January 1975 as a result of the next pay research round.    Whateverwe do must allow for these problems,2
7. There is also the pension problem.    If we were to reject the report and substitute smaller increases, those who retired before there was anopportunity for their salaries to catch up &quot;and their widows would suffer a continuing penalty after they had retired.    It would be preferable to choosea course under which this continuing penalty could be avoided.8.        One of the options open to us is to accept the report but stage the increases.    If we were so to decide in principle, we should have to decide how and over what period to stage.    We could stage by two equalinstalments; or we could relate the first stage to the movement of the retail price index since 1 January 1974.    Either of these bases of stagingwould need some modification at particular points to deal with the severestproblems of compression.    If we were not to leave ourselves with a continuing problem of backlog to overtake, we should limit ourselves to twoinstalments, the first payable on 1 January 1975, the second six (or possiblynine) months later,    I am advised that pensions could be protected under astaging operation, if the full recommended rates were promulgated asbeing the &quot;true&quot; ones, with the staged rates substituted de facto for the true rates during the period of the staging.9-        There is one other option which we should consider in conjunctionwith the options listed in the memorandum by officials and in paragraph 2of this memorandum.    That is to deal with the Review Body&apos;srecommendations in the context of a wider-ranging package which wouldalso include a call for restraint at the higher income levels in the private sector, as well as in other parts of the public sector.    Such a packagemight be on the following lines: \i. We agree to implement the Review Body&apos;s recommendations in full from the due date.ii. We invite those covered by the recommendations not to drawpart of their increases for a certain period, the length of whichshould take account of the consideration which I have mentioned inparagraph 6 of this memorandum,iii. We invite other people on correspondingly high incomes,in the private sector as well as in the public sector, hot to draw acorresponding proportion of their incomes for a similar period.To this we could add (if Ministers so decided) an announcement that ministers had agreed to forgo a corresponding proportion of their salaries for a similar period,10,       I have set out in a separate memorandum (C(74) 134) the considerations which we have to take into account in deciding aboutMinisterial salaries.    There is of course no necessary connection between Ministerial salaries and public service salaries covered by this
TSRB Report (other than that both groups of salaries fall within the ReviewBodyrs general remit), and we could proceed with the sort of package Ihave outlined without adding to it anything pn Ministerial salaries, whichhave remained unchanged since April 1972.    But an appeal to highincome earners, in the private as well as in the public sector, not to drawpart of their incomes for a period would clearly have greater authority ifwe ourselves were taking similar action in relation to our own salaries.11.       So far as those covered by the TSRB Report were concerned, the package I have described would be in essence a request for a voluntary agreement to stage their increases; it would thus be (so far as theywere concerned) a variant of staging, extended to cover other incomesat corresponding levels.   We should have to decide what form thisvoluntary self-denial should take, from what level of incomes it should operate, and for what period it should run.12.       I am personally less interested in penalising those concerned inthe public services - whose incomes are generally speaking well below those of their counterparts in the private sector and who do not enjoycomparable fringe benefits - than in getting a significant degree of restraint and self-denial from those on the highest income levels in the private sector.    Those people often have the backing of capital as well assizeable fringe benefits;  and the levels of their incomes, and the amounts of increases in them, are especially provocative.   I should therefore liketo see not only the absolute amount but the percentage amount of salaryforgone increase with the level of income.    This would suggest that we might call upon people to forgo for six months (or perhaps nine months) -the period suggested reflects the need not to build into whatever we do afurther backlog to be overtaken next year - a certain proportion of theamount by which their income exceeded, say,  10, 000 - which we have to remember is equivalent in terms of purchasing power to less than  6, 000five years ago.    If we decided that Cabinet Ministers would also forgo partof their salaries, a formula on these lines would provide a basis for fixing the size of a much smaller consequential reduction for Ministers ofState; Parliamentary Secretaries&apos; salaries would not be affected.    the table annexed to this memorandum illustrates the consequences of fixing the proportion of income in excess of  10, 000 figure at a. 10 per cent,b. 20 per cent, and c, 25 per cent.13,       So far as the groups covered by the Review Body*e Report areconcerned, this formula could be regarded as fairer than either of thestaging proposals mentioned in paragraph 8 of this memorandum, since itwould operate on the level of salary recommended by the Review Bodyrather than being based on existing salary.    The result would be that thosewho stand to gain most from the recommendations - those who have been most out of line - would get larger &quot;first instalments&quot; than under either of the staging proposals, while those who stand to gain least would getsmaller &quot;first instalments&quot;,
14.       The advantages of an arrangement of this kind would be that itwould deal with the problem of protecting the pension rights of those in thepublic services on the point of retirement (see paragraph 7 above); that itwould overcome the problems of compression (see paragraph 6 above);that it would be non-discriminatory as between the public and private sectors; that, being voluntary, an appeal on these lines would be betterreceived by those covered by the Boyle Report than some compulsorymodification or staging of the Boyle recommendations, and would stand avery good chance of a positive response from them; that highly paidpeople in other parts of the public sector and in the private sector would feel morally obliged to follow suit: and that the whole package, coveringnot only &quot;top salaries&quot; in the public services but also high incomeearners generally, would make a bigger impact on trade unions ,and on work-people than merely staging the &quot;top salary&quot; increases in the public services.    The disadvantage of such a package would be that it would lookless decisive than an imposed staging (or other modification) for those covered by the Review Body!s Report, since it would leave the decisionto individual consciences.&apos; - &apos; ll&quot;r      &apos;15.       We need now to take decisions in principle upon:a. our choice between the five options available to us fordealing with the Review Body&apos;s Report:i. accept and implement in full:ii. accept and implement in stages; i ihiii. reject and substitute smaller increases;iv. reject and make no increases, or different increasesat a later date;v. use it as a basis for inviting all high income earners,in the private sector as well as in the public sector, to forgo part of their incomes for a period.b. what we do about Ministerial salaries, our options on whi,chare set out in paragraph 12 of C(74) 134. i jIn the light of our discussion on these various courses we can thencommission detailed work on the implementation and presentation of what we have decided.H W10 Downing Street3 December 19745

1  APPENDIXTOP SALARIES REVIEW &apos; BO DY,, report memorandum by officials the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) submitted to the Prime Minister on 18 Octoberits first substantive report on the groups within its standing terms of reference.This paper is intended to assist Ministers in reaching decisions on the questionof implementation.2.     A note on the status, functions and recent history of the Review Body isat Annex A.Background     \ v3.     Since the last substantive reviews of these groups which were related to conditions in 1969* there have been growing difficulties both in terms of recruitment and retention and the compression of salary differentials.   Theformer are most clearly seen in the increasingly difficult task of manningnationalised industry boards with individuals of appropriate calibre- but theyare not confined to the nationalised industries.   The compression effect appearsmost acutely in the CiAdl Service -as shown in Annex B; as from 7 November thisyear - following the second stage of the 1973 &apos; anomalies award&apos; to assistant secretaries - the differential between the Assistant Secretary and Under Secretarygrades will be down to  150.    Compression px^oblems are also reflected at certain points&quot;in the judicial structure (where there are definite links or relativitieswith the Civil Service), and in the nationalised industries the problems of recruitment and retention at senior staff levels are compounded by the lack of  ^1headroom&apos; in relation to board salaries (in some cases senior staff salariesoverlap those of board members).    Compression at present is not so severe in the armed Forces, but could rapidly become so in the event, as expected, of substantial increases for ranks below the TSRB levels emerging from the current Armed Forcesreview - due to take effect from April 1975.4.     There is no doubt that salaries in some cases have fallen seriously behindthose of comparable groups in other parts of the economy, and this in turn hascorrespondingly depressed pensions which are directly tied to the level of salary.This is a permanent disadvantage to those now retiring.   For example, public servants who retired 2 years ago on salaries of around  15,000 have benefitedfrom successive cost-of-living pension increases with the result that after December next they will receive pensions up to  2,000 higher than thosecurrently retiring at the same levels.
f5.     There have been signs of growing unease among the groups concerned overthe delay in the appearance of the TSRB&apos;s substantive report.   The National staff side for the Civil Service - the only case in which there is representationalmachinery - has expressed its deep anxiety about the implications for the CivilService not only at these but also at lower levels, and the First DivisionAssociation has made representations on a number of occasions both, nationallyand at departmental level; but dissatisfaction is by no means confined to theCivil Service.   Against this background, pressure will mount for the Governmentto declare its intentions.   It is therefore a matter of urgency that the Governmentshould reach decisions about the report &apos;s implementation.The Contents of the Report 11A.     General principles6.     The report is based on a massive quantity of evidence and the results ofspecial studies (documented in appendices to the report), including detailed jobcomparison and evaluation exercises - carried out with assistance from management consultants, studies to compare superannuation benefits and degrees of jobsecurity, and special surveys of salaries and earnings in relevant areas.   In theend however, as they acknowledge, they have had to exercise their independentjudgment on the facts before them; in doing&apos;so they have been guided by certain general principles of pay determination.7.     Three principles receive particular emphasis in the report: comparability,the need for adequate differentials and the need to have regard tojthe &apos;totalremuneration package&apos; (ie to take account in making comparisons of the relativeweight of benefits other than basic salary - pensions, cars, etc).8.     The Review Body says that it does not attempt to match the highest salarylevels outside.    It takes the view that in any case comparisons become increasinglydubious at the higher levels; the best that can be done is to take comparison asfar up as it will go and then concentrate on setting reasonable differentials.9.     The comparative approach is in fact applied more fully in the case of the nationalised industries than in the other three groups.   In the nationalised industries the Review Body recognises - albeit with some qualifications - thesimilarities with other parts of industry and the frequent need to recruit andretain people at top level from the private sector.2
10.   In the three more traditional public services on the other hand, comparabilitis diluted by reference to a number of elements: differences in the nature ofaccountability and therefore of decision-making (talcing into account the natureof Ministerial responsibility); the extent of resources controlled; the emphasis on internal promotion and the relatively small amount of recruitment at the moresenior levels; &apos;tradition and convention&apos; (eg of lower pay in the public service).Some weight is given to greater job security.   The report also touches on therelative degree of &apos;net job satisfaction&apos; (including status and prestige) offered by the public service, but simply concludes that no one sector has the monopoly of this.11.   The Review Body say that since their work began, the problems of pay structure and disparities with outside remuneration have become even more acute.They &quot;believe that it is of great importance to take this present opportunity torectify the situation and in particular to establish a reasonable relationship between the public and private sectors&quot;.   They also comment that: &quot;There will nodoubt be those who regard any large increase in top salaries at the present time as inappropriate.   But whatever views may be held about the treatment of income and capital distribution as a matter of overall national policy, we do not believethat it would be either practicable or desirable for any Government to lead a movement towards greater equality from the public sector on its own&quot;.B-     The Recommendations for each Group12.   The increases recommended are tabulated in cash and percentage terms in annex C.i.     The Civil Service13.   The recommendations here are relatively uncomplicated.   If implemented, theywould bring about some widening of differentials at any rate for the time being,particularly at the lower end of the grades covered, where they have been over-compressed.   The next round of pay research increases for Assistant Secretariescould however again bite deeply into the Assistant Secretary/Under Secretarydifferential, and any scheme for staging would almost certainly entail a continuing compression problem which it would be essential to resolve.14.   The increases recommended range from  3,000 (for Under Secretaries) to 5,650 (top Permanent Secretary pests), or in rounded percentages from 24$(Second Permanent Secretary) to 35$ (Deputy Secretary).   The overall weightedaverage increase on present salaries (ie based on number in post) would be 33$.3
iv.   Nationalised Industries19. The Review Body has abandoned the formal banding of industries into three groups, on the basis of the scale of assets, as introduced by the NBPI.   They15.   The report says that the salaries for senior officers in the armed forces and those for the Civil Service should continue to he related, and the recommend,ations therefore simply reflect those for Civil Service grades; it is also recommended that certain special payments, generally of a minor character, shouldbe withdrawn.16.   The ;increases range from  2,650 (Major General) to  6,650 (Field Marshal),or in percentages from T]% (Major General) to 41$ (General).   Overall theweighted average increases would amount to 31%--. &apos; &quot;i       .. &apos;   i .      ,      &apos; !iii. The Judiciary17.   The Review Body has paid particular attention to rationalising the structural framework of judicial salaries.   They regard it as wrong that theLord Chancellor&apos;s salary - in spite of Ms formal role as head of the judiciary -should continue to act as a ceiling on judicial salaries.   In their view theLord Chancellor&apos;s salary should be determined in the context of ministerial salaries (as it was in 1971).   This has enabled them, in line with their assess-ments of job weight, to pull out the upper end of the structure - from High court judge to Lord Chief Justice - including the introduction of a differential forjudges promoted to the Court of Appeal.    Commensurate increases are proposed forthe senior Scottish judges.   Although they find no incontrovertible reason whythe salar3r of the High Court Judge should be on a par with that of the permanent secretary, they have considered it right to preserve this relationship.   in contrast to this pulling out at the higher levels, the lower part of they pay structure (from Circuit Judge downwards) has been somewhat compressed.   The RevievBody makes it clear that in determining judicial salaries generally, they have regarded levels of earnings at the Bar only as a cross-check and have recognised the very substantial value of the judicial pension.18,   The increases range widely from  1,400 (Recorder of London) to  8,150 (lord president of the Court of Session), and from 10% (Recorder of London) to 51%(Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland).   The overall weighted average increase would be
point out that complexity as well as size needs to be taken into account, andhave adopted a more refined ranking according to their evakuation of the Chairman1job in each case   It is open to question qhether they have not indeed attempted to be over-precise.20.   There are some changes in the relative positions of particular boards, butin general no unacceptable violence is done to the present ranking.   So far as thelevel of increases is concerned, the most significant movements arise among thoseboards in the upper part of the structure.   For the Chairman of the present &apos;groupA1 boards (British Rail, National Coal Board, etc), an increase of  11,900   is recommended, producing a new salary level of  35*000 and enlarging the lead over* group B&apos; Chairmen from  3,500 to  11,000.   The increase for board members inthis &apos;A group -  4,900 - is also considerable.   -It is recommended that the boardof the British Steel Corporation should receive increases of the same order - thesame in fact for the Chairman, ie  11^900, giving a new salary of  40,000, and rather more, around  5,400, for board members - thus maintaining its speciallead (though the NBPI had envisaged that it would eventually be brought into line with the general run of &apos;A boards&apos;).    The Post Office board - in recognition, ofthe size and complexity of its operations - is promoted for the first time to thesame level as British Steel, thereby occasioning the largest increases in thereport:  16,900 for the Chairman and around  9,400 for board members.   Amonglower-placed boards, the increases recommended are considerably more modest and ina few cases (eg British Waterways Board) reductions are proposed - subject to themaintenance of present salaries for existing incumbents.   The overall effect isnot that bigger average increases are recommended for the nationalised industriesthan for the other groups but that the spread between the top and bottom of the nationalised industry structure will become considerably wider than it has been.The range and variation of increases is thus very wide indeed, giving a weightedaverage increase of approximately 32%,21.   The report recommends ranges of pay - in contrast to flat rates - for allappointments below the level of Chairman, and that Chairmen themselves should have greater freedom to position board members within the ranges.   It is suggestedthat this latter recommendation, together with other secondary recommendations -such as that on the length of board appointments - should be left for separate consideration after Ministers have decided on the main body of the report.C.     Overall Effects22.   The overall, average increase on present salaries resulting from therecommendations for all groups would be. just under 31^ costing just over  5 million. In a full year. .5
23.   In view of the central objective stated in the TUC guidelines of ensuring,thatreal incomes are maintained, it is of interest to compare the overall size of the increases recommended with the movement of the Retail Price Index.   This is shownin Annex D together with comparisons of movements in average earnings and salaries.As from 1 January 1974, the recommendations amount to an overall average increaseof approximately 31$, compared to an estimated movement in the RPI for the year to.1 January 1975 of 17/l8$.   A similar comparison as from 1 January 1972 - theeffective1 date of the TSRB&apos;s first interim report, which was intended to be &apos;astopgap pending completion of the substantive report - yields figures of 38^(average salary increase) and 42$ (RPI).   But if the movements from 1 July 1969(the base year for the last substantive reviews) are considered, the figures arerespectively 64$ (average salary increase) and 71$ (RPI).   It will also be seen thatif the recommendations are implemented the increases for these groups since IQ69(64$ overall) would still be very much less than the general increase in average earnings (105$) or in average salaries (98$).24.   As can be seen from Annex C, the increases are at these levels very signi-ficantly reduced by taxation; but any suggestion that the effect of tax should be presented as a justification for increases could have widespread inflationaryeffects, since other groups, accepting increases in line with the TUC recommendationare likely- to suffer some fall in their real income net of tax.The Options25.   The main options available for dealing with the report are:-i.   to accept and implement the report as it stands:ii.   to accept the report but stage the increases;iii.   to reject the report in favour of lesser increases.Taking these options in turn:i,     Accept and implement the report as it stands26.   Ih favour of this course it can be argued that:- the recommendations are justified by a comprehensive study carried out by anindependent body specially created for this purpose; and there is a commitine!to accept them in. the absence of clear and compelling reasons to the contrai)- the increases are necessary to establish reasonable relationships withlevels of remuneration outside these public services, which have increasinglyfallen behind since their last substantive reviews dating back to.1969; m06 ..: I
Vs.over, the Government has declared that there shall be no discrimination &apos;against the public service as compared with other sectors and has endorsed the principle of fair comparison; thus any other course but acceptance would call into question the Government1s good faith as an employer;- the increases are necessary in the face of growing recruitment and retentionproblems, particularly in the nationalised industries (where there will bemore &quot;posts to be filled with the creation of additional boards, eg BNOC).,and of salary compression problems in the Civil Service and other groups; .- the increases are broadly consistent with the TUC guideline priority ofcompensating for rises in the cost of living since the last settlement on thebasis that the last substantive settlement in 1969 is the relevant one forthis purpose; they in any case represent the results of a basic revaluationon which the TSRB has continued to work with the approval of successive governments;- rejection would almost&apos; certainly lead to the resignation of the Review body and thus to an awkward vacuum in this and other areas where negotiation isnot appropriate or not feasible (including the review of the pay and allowances of Members of Parliament).Iff  :27.   Against acceptance of the report as it stands it can be argued that:- most of the increases cannot be reconciled with the TUC guidelines (excluding any argument based on restructuring) if measured against the movement in theRPI since the last (interim) increase which took effect from the beginningof 1974 (the overall percentage increase would exceed the estimated movementin the RPI for a full twelve months by about 13%);- the very large cash increases involved could well have an adverse effect onthe willingness of trade unions and workpeople to observe the social contractor exercise restraint generally;- increases of this order might in particular add to the Government&apos;difficulties in securing restraint in the rate of movement among low-paid workers towards the tuc&apos;s low pay target of  30 a week.Accept the report but sta^e the increases -28.   In the current circumstances of high inflation, and given the acute salarycompression existing at certain points in the Civil Service and elsewhere, it is
extremely doubtful whether it would be practicable to extend staging over morethan a year with two: instalments.   The option is assessed on this assumption.29.   In favour it could be argued that staging would:- retain the advantages of basic acceptance while assisting the public presentation of the report;\ -- tend to reduce the adverse effect on the adherence of other groups to the tuc guidelines.30.   Against are the arguments that under staging: (- increases would still be large and the presentational advantage would be correspondingly limited;- some resentment would no doubt be aroused among those affected and stagitwithout a definite commitment to implement the outstanding amounts a yearlater would probably be regarded as equivalent to an actual cut in therecommendations;- there would be problems of dealing with a possible second wave or large increases in, say, a year&apos;s time in an uncertain policy context;.- the likel^y reactions of the TSRB itself to staging are also uncertain,31. Ang scheme for staging would need to allow for a solution to the assistant secretary/Under Secretary differential problem if a serious clash with the NatiiStaff Side was to be avoided. Provision would also need to be made to protect tipensions of those retiring during the staging period.iii. Reject the report in favour of lesser increases32. If the report is rejected, it will be necessary to formulate alternative proposals for increases to take effect on the next due dates; to withhold increifrom these groups altogether would - apart from other considerations - be unteniin the absence of a general policy disallowing increases at the higher salarylevels. A selective approach to the report on the other hand, involving reject!of substantial areas of the report, would be regarded as a major challenge tot!Review Body!s independent judgment on the merits of particular cases, since thejmake it clear that they have looked at the groups concerned as a whole and in
relation to each other as well as comparing them with outside groups;.   The mostdefensible approach therefore, in the event of rejection, would probably be todetermine lesser increases on the basis of some constraint which might be held to be justifiable in terms of the current economic situation.33.   This approach might take one of many forms of which the following threeare illustrations:i. limit the increases to the percentage justified by the rise in thecost-of-living over the last twelve months, thus putting beyond question,conformity with the TUC guidelines;ii. as in i. but the percentage increase to be applied only up to a specifiedlevel of salary, eg the first  15,000;iii. no pay increase at all for those earning more than some specified figure.. lit     IS  S i;34.   In. general the arguments for and against the substitution of lesser increases are essentially the obverse of those for and against accepting the report as it stands (paragraphs 26 and 27 above), and in any event it would be necessary to give special consideration to the protection of pensions.   More particularly howeverit would be difficult, against the background of certain other public sector pa7,r   \\-settlements since the emergence of the TUC guidelines, to modify the recommendationsexcept, on high pay grounds.   Since the guidelines themselves are i silent on high, pay,it would therefore be necessary to devise and launch a new policy covering highpay in order to justify the Government!s decision on the report.   This would beopen to serious challenge on the grounds:- that if there is to be a specific policy on high pay it should be developed as one of universal application, preferably on the basis of a RoyalCommission Report, after talcing account of all the complex factors involved,including the role of taxation as the obvious method of income   redistribution-bution; j j- that in the meantime a decision not to implement the Report!s recommendations on high pay grounds would amount to discrimination against the public sectorgroups affected; and that their pay should be put on a proper basis and onlythen be subject to any universal, high pay policy operating effectivelythroughout, the community as a whole.
35.   Ministers are invited to consider the options set out in this paper.In the light of their decision, it is suggested that officials should then beasked to formulate more detailed proposals, either for the presentation of report - if it is decided to accept &apos;it as it stands - or for pursuing one orother of the further options.10
ANNEX ATHE STATUS, FUNCTIONS AND RECENT HISTORY OF THE top salaries REVIEW BODY ,1.     The TSRB, whoso Chairman is lord Boyle, is one of throeindependent review bodies set up in 1971 to make recommendations on the remuneration of certain groups not covered by normal negotiating arrangements (the other twobeing those for doctors and dentists and for the armed forces); it is serviced in common with the other review 1bodies by the Office of Manpower Economics.   Its terms ofreference are:; &quot;To advise the Prime Minister on the remuneration ofthe Chairmen and members of the boards of nationalised&apos;. industries; the higher judiciary; senior civil&apos; servants;senior officers of the armed forces and other groups which may be. referred to it.&quot;In addition to the groups directly within these terms ofreference, there is a wide range of public boards&apos;, generally4j of a non-commercial character, with salaries related to those for one or other of the TSRB groups and which receiveconsequential increases following the implementation of TSRBincreases.2,     As its first task following the appointment of members in May 1971. the Roview Body was in fact asked to review the. emoluments, allowances and expenses of Ministers and MPs-,on which it reported in December 1971, and this somewhat .delayed the start of its work on. the top salaries group.Following another ad hoc. reference, the Review Body also reported on MPs1   allowances in June 1974* and would bo the expected instrument for any further reviews of the remunera-tion of Ministers and KPa (the possibility of a standingreference has been mooted in Ministerial discussions)*This report represents the first substantive - as distinct from interim - roview of the remuneration of civilservants and of Chairmen and members of nationalised\,J \n 5 -i X    i, &apos;J t-. i I I  if&quot; An

industries since 1969, when the increases recommended respectively in the last report of the Standing Advisory Committee on Higher Civil Service Pay under Lord Plowden and report No 107 of the National Board for Prices and Incomes, were spread over three stages, the final instalments not becoming payable until 1 January 1971. Moreover, although substantive increases were introduced for the higher judiciary in 1970 (staged in two parts to January 1971), and for senior officers of the armed forces from January 1971, these were designed to reflect the increases already awarded to senior civil servants in 1969.

4. The Review Body has however produced three interim reports, resulting in increases from 1 January 1972, 1973 and 1974 (but from July of each year for certain judges). The first interim report recommended increases ranging from £1,500 to £2,500, which the TSRB regarded as the minimum required to prevent the remuneration of these groups falling too far behind that of comparable occupations pending completion of its substantive report. The Review Body at that time expected the substantive review to be complete within a year (ie by mid-1975), but this proved to be over optimistic and further interim increases became necessary under the Stage 2 and Stage 3 statutory pay limits: ie a general increase of £250 in 1973, and of £350 in 1974 (Under- Secretaries also received an additional £150 in view of extreme salary compression) plus threshold payments. The recommendations now made in the substantive report are of course not intended to take effect before 1975.

5. So far as the status of review body recommendations concerned, the Secretary of State for Employment at the time the setting up of the review bodies was announced (Mr Robert Carr) said in the House of Commons on 2 November 1970: "The recommendations of the bodies will be accepted by the Government unless there are clear and compelling reasons for not doing so" - and the TSRB itself recorded this


declaration of intent in its first interim report.   In ameeting with the throe Chairmen on 21 June 197U, the Prime-Minister said that the Government &quot;believed that reviewbodies had a useful and important part to play in providingcertain groups of employees with the assurance that their remuneration was fairly and authoritatively determined;though the problem remained that they had to take their decisions against the background of the economic problemsfacing the country.   Lord; Boyle for his part acknowledgedthat the review bodies, though independent, existed withinthe matrix of whatever economic and incomes policy theGovernment of the day was following.   The Prime Ministerwent on to say that the Government recognised the urgency of the TSRB&apos;s work, and hoped that the TSRB would comploteits substantive report so that the results could be implemented from 1 January 1975.,6.     More recently, tho standing of the TSRB (as well as of-the Doctors and Dentists Roviow Body) has been the subjectof some attention in the context of the recent reference on higher incomes to the Royal Commission on the Distributionof Income and Wealth.   The press statement released with thoreference pointed out that the Government wished to make itabsolutely clear that the Royal Commission would have a quite separate and distinct function from that of the reviewbodies.   While tho Commission would be concerned with abroad analytical study of the facts regarding higher incomesboth in the public and private sectorst the review bodies,&quot;on the other hand, have been charged by the Governmentwith the specific responsibility of advising them on theappropriate remuneration for particular groups within thepublic sector,   There is no question, therefore, of thoRoyal Commission taking over any of the functions of the review bodies, nor of the review bodies5 recommendations
being referred to it or votted by it,   Their functiono.independence and relationship with the Government andthe professionas they deal with will be quite unohangscl/&apos;1
CIVIL SERVICE COMPRESSION PROBLEMSSevere management problems arise from the interfaoe oftwo separate systems for pay determination at the assistant secretary/Under Secretary level.   The: Assistant Secretary,in common with other grades in the Administration Group,is the subject of Pay Research and his pay is thereforedetermined by what is paid for comparable work outside.The Under Secretary on the other hand is within the termsof reference of the 2op Salaries Review Body.&apos; &apos;2. The effect of the two distinct systems, and theirtiming, has been:date,1*19711,1.19721,1.1974AssistantSecretary  -maximum 6800 indicated by Pay Research 6300 actually paid 7276 ( 6800 4- ,11* CPI) 8500 indicated by Pay Research.( 7U76 actually paid from 1 Aprilunder Stage 2; 7988 paid from.11.73) 8850 (Stage 3)( 8338 actually paid from 1.1=74, 8850 from 7.11.74)UnderSecretaryrate 6500 8250 (TSRBinterim) 8500 (TSRBStage 2 paid from 1 April) 9000 (TSRBStage 3)3,    The last two Pay Research rounds (1971 and 1973) have indicated large increases for tho Assistant Secretary, andthere is reason to expect that similar increases will heshown to he due from 1 January 1975.   Unless, therefore,
there is a very substantial improvement in the UnderSecretary rate, the severe compression problem which hasexisted more or less continuously for the last k years will continue.   From management&apos;s point of view, thesertproblems may be summarised as follows?a. Assistant Secretary pay is consistently heldbehind what is known to be indicated by the accepted fair comparison principlesb. to the extent that the promulgated rate is held^ &apos; .-. &quot; &apos; &apos;. &apos; -   Iback, there is a permanent loss for those retiijsince their final pension is based on a lower jfigure than is known to be justified;c. there is no adequate pay reflection of the responsibilities of the two grades;d. there   are a considerable number of posts and I- grades which lie between the Assistant Secretar]maximum and the Under Secretary rate; at present,    these managerial hierarchies are seriouslydistorted with differentials of the ord,er of onjj 60- 70;e. some pay-related groups are very sensitive to market pressures, giving rise to recruitmentdifficulties while Civil Service rates areconsistently seriously out of line.    i,i4. In 1971 and 1973 it was possible to reach agreement!with the Staff Side on arrangements for holding back J.Assistant Secretary pay since the root cause lay in the!lack of a report by tho TSRB. Now, the TSRB report has^provided for headroom for an Assistant Secretary pay
review.   If the Government docidoa not to implement thisrecommendation, it would aa an act of policy, he removingindefinitely the possibility of effective negotiations onAssistant Secretary pay.5.     Disputes on the results of J?ay Research for the assistant Secretary cannot ho taken to arbitration bythe Staff Side except by agreement.   She general underatandln,is that this agreement will not bo unreasonably withheld;but it would be difficult to allow a dispute to go to arbitration &quot;where essentially what was in issue&apos; wasmanagement&apos;s right to preserve a differential botwoohclearly distinguished, levels of responsibility in the samehierarchy.   It is accepted that tho primary prinoiple of pay &apos;determination for the Assistant Secretary is fair comparisonsas established by Pay Research, and the Priestley RoyalCommission recommended that internal rolativitios, thoughrelevant, should not be allowed to ovorrido this principle.In practice, Ministers would bo uniikoly to find it possibleto have Assistant Sooretarios paid more than UnderSecretaries j without the headroom reooamonded by the TSR3$he Pay Research evidonco is likely to justify that situation; and there would therefore be little alternative,to overriding the Pay Research evidence (either absolutelyas in 1971 or by staging as in 1975), and bluntly refusingarbitration which co-old confidently bo expected to award &apos;.for the Staff Side. &apos;Such a course would almost certainly be taken up by the Staff Side as a whole as an issue of!confidence in the fair comparison principle.   What has proved possible in the past merely aggravates presentfeellngSo - - ...&quot;
