OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S government(74) 143 0 4COPY NO      014 December 1974CABINET fjPAY OF NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CONSULTANTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. Consultants in the National Health Service (NHS) are seriouslydisaffected.    They have for some years been seeking a better contract and when we took office in February were already threatening industrial action unless we were willing to examine their complaints.    This we agreed to do provided the examination also included the phasing of pay bedsout of NHS hospitals in keeping with our Manifesto commitments.A BETTER CONTRACT2.        At present those consultants who do not commit themselves whollyto the NHS are allowed to do private practice in return for a reduction in pay.    In the case of the maximum part-time contract of 11 sessions the deduction is 2/llths.    Moreover a sum of  10 million is currently      ! &apos;distributed in the form of distinction awards which are allocated secretlyby an independent medical body and which go largely to those alreadyheavily engaged in private practice ie to those working in the mostpopular specialities and in the most favoured parts of the Service such asthe London teaching hospitals.3. This situation has serious drawbacks for the NHS as well as the consultants.    At present there is no means of policing the extent to whichthe part-timer discharges his obligations.    Some with large privatepractices subordinate their NHS patients to their private ones.    Others,with only a small number of private patients or none at all, work longhours in the NHS well beyond their 11-session commitment and they get noreward for this extra work.    The result is that consultants are dis-couraged from going to difficult areas where there is a heavy work-loadand shortage of staff.    The phasing of pay beds out of NHS hospitalswill lead to a loss of private practice in certain areas.    In others it couldencourage consultants to go wholly outside the Service unless a contractcan be agreed which encourages a greater commitment to the NHS.1
4. The discussions with the consultant representatives have been difficult and without commitment on our side.    It is possible that agreement will not be reached.    In that case it is essential that weshould be seen publicly to have made a reasonable offer.    The british medical Association (BMA) have already circularised their membersconcerned inviting them to join &quot;locum agencies&quot; from which theAssociation could offer their services back to hospitals after theirresignation from the NHS.    If this proposal were to get off the groundhealth authorities would be faced with the need to re-engage consultantson a purely sessional basis without our having achieved the safeguards for the NHS which we are seeking. v5.        I therefore ask my colleagues to allow me to offer consultantsfirm proposals for a new contract which I have outlined in the Annex.It meets their demand that extra effort and a fuller commitment to the nhs should be rewarded while maintaining the present differential infavour of the whole-timer who foregoes private practice to make himselftotally available.    In my view it offers the only basis on which agreement -now or later - can be reached while at the same time enabling us to fulfil the aims of our Manifesto.COST6. Through these new contract proposals we are rightly seeking to overcome some major defects in the compromises made when the NHSwas introduced.    This is a restructuring which is bound to require some additional money and consultants are expecting this.7. The doctors and Dentists&quot; Review Body are due to reviewsubstantively doctors pay for April 1975.    They are currently consideringan application from the BMA for an interim increase and whether or not torecommend a breach of the 12 month rule.    In any event, the outcome ofthe April review will be a recommendation for a major increase for allgrades.    Its size is difficult to predict but it is likely to be of the orderof 25-30 per cent and the consultants are likely to be awarded a goodshare of this.8.        We would argue to the Review Body that the total cost ofrestructuring and in particular paying for extra work not previouslyremunerated should be offset against the general increase, especially for shortfall, for this group.    They will be asked to price the totality ofthe contract at a fair new level overall.    I hope therefore that the total increase on the present consultants&apos; annual pay bill can be kept below therough estimate (mentioned to EC(P)) of  33 million, of which about 15. 5 million would be in any case recommended to us by the Review Body;and that the element for restructuring as such might be well within 20 million.
9. The increase in the pay bill will secure additional serviceestimated at about  5 million: I am prepared to meet that part of thecost from offsetting savings.10.       To the extent that the balance has to count as expenditure in real terms, I have suggested that the sum - probably a maximum of about 12 million - might be met from the contingency reserve.11.       The increased pay bill cost needs to be clearly distinguished from the loss of charges as private beds are phased out.    I proposeto phase out over a period of years and to deal in the meantime withqueue jumping by means of common waiting lists for private and NHSbeds.    The loss of charges, ultimately  20 million per annum, will be felt gradually and given a three-year phasing out need be no more than about  6 million in 1975-76, and will similarly require an increase inmy programme to be met from the contingency reserve.&quot;REPERCUSSIONS-     : 1: &apos; \:.:       M       &apos;/;,: -12&apos;.       I recognise that some of my colleagues may find it difficult toaccept that large increases for one of the more highly paid groups willnot have serious repercussions,13.       Neither the general practitioners however nor the juniordoctors have a similar case for a major pay restructuring.    As for    ,,&apos;wider repercussions, the most serious danger may be that payment for extra sessions is represented as a kind of overtime for a highly paidgroup.    But the extra sessions will be identified and contracted for inadvance as part of the individual contract which each consultant makeswith his employing authority.    This is, I believe, a unique feature andunlikely to be paralleled elsewhere.    There will be no clocking up ofodd half hours or hours of overtime after the end of a day.    If I do not meet the consultants on their work-load point, they will take industrial action, withdraw the substantial &quot;overtime&quot; they are now doing andexpect us to buy them back.14.       In sum, I believe that my proposals taken as a whole fall withinthe scope of the social contract.    They meet our Manifesto commitmentand will help to attract doctors to staff the NHS whole-time raiher thanexpand private practice outside the NHS hospitals.    Those consultantswho secure considerable increases will be those who work the hardest,and by committing themselves to the NHS rely oh us for their total income.TIMING15.       In the light of the EC(P) discussion on Tuesday the BMA have been told we are not ready yet to present Government proposals.    I will report their reactions to Cabinet, orally.    Clearly, it is now essential toreveal the Governments proposals to the consultants and the public.3      \
There is no need, however, to discuss at this stage the pricing of the contract; this will be for the Review Body to whom it would not be sentuntil the New Year.SUMMARY16.       I ask ray colleagues to agree to a Government offer in principleof the new contract proposals which would be published and in due course submitted to the Review Body for pricing.    I would submit to ,my colleagues the line of evidence I propose to offer to the Review Body.&apos;;&apos; -J?i .&apos;; :&quot;i   - Vr.   &apos; - .v J WiBAC//&quot;Department of Health and Social Security4 December 1974
CONFIDENTIALANNEXPROPOSALS FOR CONSULTANT CONTRACT1.        ,,There are  the equivalent  of about1 11 ,500  consultants  inGreat  Britain,  of whom about   5,200 have whole-time salaried contracts of   the remainder,   the majority have maximum part-time  contractswhich require them  to work virtually full-time   in  the NHS,  butallow  them to practice  independently using NHS pay beds or  facilitieselsewhere.    Maximum part-timers  receive 9/11  of   the whole-timepay,  but   their  contracts  are otherwise substantially the same.PRESENT CONTRACT2. The main  features of  the  present  consultant  contract  are  -a. basic  commitment  -  11   sessions a week covering  clinicaland  related administrative work,  and  clinical   teaching of medical   students; &apos; nb. hours     - no precise hours of duty each week;     sessionsare assessed  roughly  in terms of &quot;notional   half days&quot;, of  3\ hours  each, but  consultants syo&apos;rk such hours as are necessary,   including night  and week end work;c. private practice  is not  permitted  to whole-tiraers;d. salary  scale  - 515,433 x 9   increments  to   7 ,947  (wef11  4 74)   covers  all  work  (apart  from  that  referred  toat   e.  below) ; -&apos;e. domiciliary visits,   exceptional   consultations,   lecturesto  non-medical   staff,   and work on the DistrictManagement Team  -  excluded from the assessment  under b.and paid  for by  item or allowance;f. distinction awards  - values are  1,506  for a  C (2914awards);     3,540 for a B  (1311  awards);      6,030  foran A  (453 awards)   and  7,947  for an A+  (124 awards).Awards  are recommended by an independent   committee.    One  third ofconsultants hold an award at any one  time;     about  50% ofconsultants receive an award during  their career.    The total   annual cost  of  the awards  is about   10m.    DHSS does not  have recent detailsof  the distribution of awards between those with whole-time  andthose with part-time  contracts.    However,   it   is known  that  a high proportion of  awards  go   to  consultants  in those  specialties wherethe proportion of whole-timers   is  relatively low (eg  50 per cent of  consultant   surgeons and  physicians have av/ards;    and 88 percent  of  surgeons  and 68  per  cent  of physicians  do private.practice).Awards  of up to  6,500 may  thus be paid  to   those whose privateearnings may be anything up to  20,000.Only part-timers  are permitted  to engage  in private practice;     thereare  two groups  -(i)       &quot;maximum part-timers&quot; have  an 11  session commitmentbut only get  paid 9/11 of salary and distinction award;&apos;(ii)       other part-timers have lesser  sessional  commitments and get  paid pro rata to   sessions performed,   eg  5/11    ,for  5 sessions.
PROPOSALS FOR THE NEW CONTRACTSessional  commitmentl,o        The consul t ant 1 s obligation to NHS work will be defined asnormally a 10  session Monday to Friday contract.    For  the  first time ever this will give  the NHS as  the employing authority the ability to require  the  regular presence of  all  consultants at  the.hospital,   instead &quot;of   a notional   commitment.     In  future,   if  theconsultant wants to do  private&apos; practice he will  have  to opt   for anI 8 + 2  session contract;     his private bed work will  be outside  the nhs hospital  and outside NHS  sessions,  not,   as  at  present,   inside the hospital   and at a time  chosen by him whether it.coincides withthe NHS  sessions or not.    The authority will  also  be able  to  review the  consultant 1s ability to provide  the  additional  2  sessions andwithdraw them on reasonable grounds,   for example,   if his private practice  commitment  affects his NHS work.2.        where  there   is  a need consultants may be  engaged for additional   sessions over  the  10   (or over  the 8+2).    Hithertoextra effort  of  this  kind by consultants   in the NHS has attractedno  extra reward,  although extra  effort devoted?, to  private practicehas brought  extra   income.    This  proposal  will   reward extra effortfor the NHS and will   even up  the relative position of  the whole-timer who will  have preference on the additional  sessions.    A  jointsurvey has  shown  tha.t much work  is  done at  evenings and week endsand  that  the average hours  consultants work, whether whole ori maximum part-time, may often be  60 or more per week.Emergency and administrative work . (     u3. Consultants   taking   the new contracts will  also  receive extraremuneration for  emergency calls to the hospital   and  for  some extrakinds of  administrative NHS work.Differential4. It   is  essential   to  continue  to  have a differential  on basicremuneration  in favour of  the whole-timer  in order  to  encouragewhole-time    commitment   to  the NHS.    At  present  2/llths  is deductedif  a consultant wishes  to engage  in private practice,  althoughstill  devoting substantially all his  time to  the NHS.    The Governmentshould maintain  its  right   to  impose a differential,   although Iv/ould be prepared to accept   if  driven to it that   it   is no larger than at  present.Distinction Awards5.        The present  system of  secret  distinction awards   is quiteunsuitable.     Important  specialities  like geriatric and psychiatrydo relatively badly,  and the system does nothing  to encourage a healthydistribution of  consultants.    A very large proportion of the awards       jgo to consultants who have private practice.     This  system shouldbe abolished except   that  those who opt  to retain their old contractsv/ould keep their present awards;    no new higher awards would be given.
CONFIDENTIAL60        To  replace  the   inegalitarian distinction awards,   costing 10m a year,   I  propose two classes of  career structure payments.The  larger,  which would quickly build up to about   5m.  would beat  the disposal   of NHS authorities  to  pay service  supplementsto  consultants who  for example tackle  the building up of NHSservices   in unattractive  areas,   or  cope with  shortages   in geriatric,pshchiatric and  similar  fields.    The  smaller class,  which wouldbe  1-2 millions,  would be  for medical   progress supplements,   toreward innovation of  special  value  to  the NHS.7.        Distribution of service  supplements  in particular would tendto  favour  the whole-timer,  who  tends  to work  in,   say,  geriatricsor  in under-privileged cities.    There   can certainly be no justification for paying  either  class  of   supplement     in additionto large private earnings,   so  that  I would not make  them availableto  those with less  than a regular 10  session commitment   to  the nhs;    also those with private practice  if awarded a  supplementwould receive only that  part,   if any,  by which the  supplementexceeded their private earnings.8.        The  career structure  supplements would not  include awardsfor seniority (such as general  practitioners currently get andfor which in effect  some at  least of  the present distinctionawards is arguably spent) but   it  is proposed to replace the presentincremental   scale by a scale of fewer,  larger steps over longerintervals:     this would help younger consultants whose currentdissatisfaction  is  strong.
