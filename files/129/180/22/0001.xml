mas DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.C(74) 147 COPY NO       8117 December 1974CABINETpay of national health service consultants&quot;&apos;-;\\ &apos;   &apos; &apos; &apos;h &apos;&apos;   . &apos;:-  &apos;: - :Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services, The decision of Cabinet on top salaries (CC(74) 51st Conclusions,Minute 4) affects my proposals for National Health Service (NHS) consultants.2.        My previous paper (C(74) 143) proposed new contracts, with featuresto encourage whole-time service and regular extra commitments to the nhs, and to help staffing in difficult areas and specialties.    I believe these to be necessary and worthwhile.    In particular that part of my proposalswhich offers a new contract with a firm sessional basis (instead of itspresent ambiguous open-endedness) is essential to control abuse ofconsultants1 time, to remedy their sense of injustice and by paying fairly Ifor extra sessions to forestall their threat to work to their interpretation of their hours, and make us buy them back again.3.        These new contracts are not affected in principle by our decisionon top salaries.   I must warn colleagues that despite the fact the constraintappears generous to us the profession^ negotiators are likely to reject it.We believe the profession as a whole may be more reasonable if we make areasonable offer to them.        .4. The negotiators object to any differential for whole-time service andto the scheme of career payments being subject to offsetting of private practice earnings; they are also urging a completely hew item of servicecontract to which I am opposed.    They want on-call payments and time anda half for extra sessions.    I intend to stand firm on the broad principles and only agree to modifications of detail in negotiation.5.        A new contract if agreed would go to the Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos;Review Body (DDRB) for pricing.    The DDRB will anyhow have to repricethe existing contract in the main 1975 review covering all doctors and dentists.    I will submit the Departmental evidence to my colleagues.6.        If forced to comment on the relationship of the Governments decisionon the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) to the findings of the DDRB, I willtell the profession that the Government reserves its right to modify theDDRB recommendations in accordance with the same principles that we are&apos; 1   .CONFIDENTIAL
applying to top salaries in the public sector and our appeal to the private sector, and taking into account the report which we are urgently requestingfrom the Royal Commission on Incomes Distribution and Wealth and anyfurther action we may take in the private sector.    This statement alonemay well promote sanctions;  a refusal to go to the DDRB;  and a demandfor direct negotiations,    Here again our only hope of preventing widespreaddisruption is if we have moved some way to meeting them over theprinciples of the new contract.PAY BEDS7.        If curbs are to be applied to consultants&apos; increases I may be compelled to postpone the start oi phasing out pay beds until 1976-77.   Inthe meantime I would propose to introduce the necessary legislation as quickly as possible; to introduce common waiting lists wherever practicable;  and to reduce pay beds where utilisation is well below thatof NHS beds.    Trades unionists may resume their disruption of services for private patients but the promise of specific legislation should help.TIMING8.        If Cabinet agrees, I will explain the Governments position on new contracts and the DDRB awards to the doctors whom I am due, to meet inthe afternoon on Friday 20 December.    I should also tell them that the      vDDRBrs report on the doctors&apos; interim claim has been received, as Iexpect it will have been, and is under consideration,   1 We may be in aposition to indicate its contents. \)DISRUPTION OF NHS9.        Doctors are in a position to reduce their working time unilaterallyand to force us to buy them back for additional sessions.    They may decide to do so after I have seen them but in my view will certainly do so if we bothreject the new contract and indicate that we intend to stage any repricing ofthe old contract the DDRB may recommend.    I must warn my colleagueswe may be in for a long period where medical services are substantially reduced and we will inevitably see a lengthening of waiting lists;..        &apos; &apos; MM   .:  %&apos; &apos; ; i &apos; -     &apos; [I ?$!:&apos; IBAGDepartment of Health and Social Security17 December 1974 .- -   kMM - :      .
