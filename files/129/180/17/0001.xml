CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 142COPY NO.       o 93 December 1974i 1CABINETFREEDOM OF THE PRESSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for employment.        At meetings on 14 and 21 November the Cabinet discussed the anxieties expressed by newspaper editors about the provisions of theTrade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Bill.    I was invited,with the Secretary of State for Trade, to consider what action might betaken and report back (CC(74) 46th Conclusions, Item 3).-----&apos;v (I . &quot;&apos;&quot;&apos;   : M       I:&apos;&apos;v:---&apos;THE bill. The Bill does not require the establishment of closed shops, northe inclusion of editors in closed shop agreements where these exist or are introduced.    All it does is to fit the provisions on unfair dismissalto the realities of the closed shop by making it fair in a closed shop to dismiss an employee who refuses to join the union, except for religiousobjectors.3. The editors have pressed for the Bill to be amended to put editorialstaff in the same position in effect as religious objectors.4. Their reasons are:-a. Inclusion in a closed shop would be incompatible withtheir managerial functions and their freedom to get out thepaper during a strike; but this is not an adequate ground for legislation.b. It would encourage the National Union of Journalists&apos; (NUJ)attempts to regulate contributions to the Press by non-professionals.    This again is not a matter in which the law should intervene.
c.      It would leave editors vulnerable to attempts by the NUJ tpinterfere with editorial policy.    But such action would be clearlycontrary to the union1 s Code of Conduct; we ought not to legislate on the assumption that the NUJ will fail to live up to itsown rules.5. To bring forward an amendment on the lines the editors wantwould immediately expose us to pressure to widen it.    The fact isthat there is a general problem of potential conflict between professionalethics and union loyalty, but it is one in which we should be very wary ofintruding the law.6. Whether or not editors and editorial staff are included in closed shop agreements should be settled not by legislation but by discussion and sensible agreements between the parties.    This view has been strongly put to me by the Trades Union Congress who are opposed to any amendments of the Bill. y.7. The NUJ share this view and have in fact now proposed discussionwith the employers and editors.    I reproduce the NUJ&apos;s letter in the annex.THE ROYAL, COMMISSION8. The closed shop and other union practices with a bearing oneditorial independence are squarely within the Royal Commission^terms of reference.    The only question which arises is whether we shouldrequest the Commission to produce an interim report on editorialindependence.9. I think this would be unwise.    I have consulted the Secretary ofState for Trade and there may be some difference of emphasis between us, but in my view a request for an interim report would be bound to beseen as an admission that the Bill has put editors in a new and dangerous situation.    It would intensify pressure for amendment of theBill to exempt editors pending the Commission^ report, and undermine the case for resisting such pressure.     It would also be seen as acondemnation of the umon&apos;s tactics in the recent dispute (not yetresolved) and would stultify the NUJ&apos;s proposal for talks with theemployers and editors.CONCLUSION10.      I invite my colleagues to agree that we should not bring forward any amendments to the Bill directed to the position of editors; that I should take this line in the further meeting with the editors to which I am committed;and that we should not request any interim report on these matters fromthe Royal Commission..M department of employment December 1974 2
(confidential)ANN2XCOPY OF LETTER DATED 2 DECEMBER 197&apos;i FROM, GENERAL SECRETARY OFNATIONAL UNION OF JOURNALISTS TO:Douglas Lowndes Esq,  DirectorThe Nexvspaper Society;John Le Page Esq,  NPA;C Gordon Page Esq,   SecretaryGuild of British Newspaper Editors;Alastair Hetherington Esq,  EditorThe Guardian;C D Hamilton Esq,  Editor-in-ChiefTimes Newspapers Limited. \\:. &apos;    &quot;        ; .;  $ I ^        &amp; &apos;   h, &apos;I am sure you will not be surprised that the NUJ has noted the anxieties expressed by editors about the provisions of the TradeUnion and Labour Relations (Amendment) Bill on unfair dismissals.It fully shares the concern of editors for the safeguarding of free expression and indeed this concern is fully reflected in the union&apos;sCode of Professional Conduct.Editors&apos;  expressed anxieties appear to  centre round closed shopagreements.    The union believes that these anxieties are misplaced,but it would welcome discussion with the other organisations concerned about v^hat safeguards might be embodied in any such agreements and the principles which should govern the applicationof such agreements to editors.In particular the union would propose adoption of a model clausefor such agreements which might provide that the parties subscribe to the principle of the freedom of the Press and other media inrelation to the collection of information and the expression ofcomment and criticism,  the need to eliminate distortion,  newssuppression and censorship,  and to ensure that dissemination isfair and accurate,  avoiding any expression of comment andconjecture as established fact and falsification by distortion,selection or misrepresentation;    and that the parties should undertake to observe these principles fully in the conduct oftheir relations with all editorial staff.I feel sure that your organisation and others involved,  to whom Ihave written,  would similarly welcome discussion on these lines.I would appreciate your comments.
