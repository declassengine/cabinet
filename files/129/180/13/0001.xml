DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S government(74) 138 COPY NO22 November 1974CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE: SOCIAL SECURITYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. There is one issue arising out of the Chancellor^ memorandum c(74) 136 which I must put before my colleagues. It is about cash provisionfor children.2.        It has been agreed that family allowances should be increased next april from  1 (90p for the second child) to  1. 50.    For those families notpaying tax or drawing benefit, this is less than enough to restore the value which the allowances had when last increased in 1968.    After tax the valuewill be restored but with little to spare.    I reluctantly agreed that our new scheme of child cash allowances including the first child should be postponed until April 1977.    I agreed with the Chancellor that the rate of the newallowances need not be settled now, but accepted for planning purposesthat provision should be made for public expenditure consistent with a rateof  2.16 per child.    For some families paying tax this rate would barelycover the net value in cash terms of the family allowance of  1.50 (for children after the first) and the current child tax allowances, though poorerfamilies would get some benefit;  as would smaller families because of thenew allowance for the first child.    On the assumptions which underly thefigures which I have accepted for planning purposes the total cash support for families would be appreciably less In real terras in 1977 than in 1975.3.        This is the starting point.    Cabinet now proposes reducing food subsidies, pressing ahead as quickly as we can with realistic pricing of fuel and increasing the charges for school meals by 15p a week each year.    Allthese are on top of the general rise in prices and particularly affect the poorer families who are not drawing benefit or receiving free school meals.Much of the value of the higher family allowances will be swept away long before we provide higher cash provision for families in April 1977.    even then, on the Chancellor^ proposals, the improvement will be modest,though that is a matter to be settled later.1
4.        Against this background we will come under mounting criticism if nothing more is done for families until 1977.    The postponement till thatdate of extension of Family Allowance to the first child will be a severedisappointment to our own side and will further weaken our defence againstthe complaint that we are doing nothing for one-parent families.    (APrivate Members1 Motion calling &quot;attention to the problems of one-parent families&quot; is likely to be debated on 29 November),    It would however bepossible at least to take a step in the direction of including the first childin Family Allowances.    My proposal for doing this is discussed in the annex.    It is to provide in 1976-77 for the first child of single-parent families only a family allowance at the same rate, and subject to the sametax and &quot;clawback&quot; arrangements^ as for other children in advance of our new child allowance scheme.    This will not do much, as the modest costof my proposal shows, but in the absence of-any general improvement in family support between 1975 and 1977 it will at least show our concern andthat we are not standing idle,5, The proposal would add  15 million to public expenditure in 1976-77,though the net Exchequer cost, which more nearly represents the demandeffect, is  7^ million.    Something like 500 staff would be needed for the duration of the scheme, at an administrative cost of  lj million bringing the total Exchequer cost to  9 million.6. The Chancellor fears that my proposal may put up the subsequentcost of our family endowment scheme by up to  100 million a year.    he considers that the new benefit would set a fresh standard for the first childand that after one-parent families had been singled out in 1976 there wouldbe pressure to ensure that they were not worse off in real terms in 1977.If child allowances were introduced at a rate sufficient to do this forone-parent families it would cost an extra  100 million.7.        I think the Chancellors fear is misplaced.    If the scheme of childbenefit is introduced on the principle that no normal family should have lessprovision in cash terms than in 1975, the absorption of the benefit for thefirst child of lone parents into the child allowance scheme would, in my view, mean increasing the rate from  2.16 to only  2,20, at a cost of 16 million.    We need not however, be committed to that expenditure,since it would be possible in the alternative either to maintain somepreference for single-parent families after 1977 (which would be a step towards implementing the recommendations of the Finer Committee) or toaccept that some families must be a few pence worse off in 1977 than in1976.    I accept that there would be pressure to ensure that families werenot worse off in real terms in 1977 than in 1976 but I think that would arisewhether or not special help is given to one-parent families in 1976,    It is aweakness in the rate of  2.16 at present allowed for in public expenditure andthis is a matter which we have to settle later.    It would, I think, be unfair to attribute this extra cost to my proposal about one-parent families.2
conclusion.        I ask my colleagues to agree that, if we can overcome the practicaldifficulties, and in particular secure the necessary temporary accommodation, we should provide a family allowance of  1.50, subjectto the usual tax and &quot;clawback&quot; arrangements, for the first (or only) childin one-parent families from April 1976 until the new scheme of child allowances is introduced in 1977.B A Cii      ii \Department of Health and Social Security22 November 1974ii3
1ANNEXOUTLINE SCHEMES FOE HELPING THE FIRST CHILD OF POOR FAMILIES1,    The proposal is to pay a special family allowance for the first children inone parent families from April 1976 before child allowances come in.   Excludingthose widowed mothers whose first children are already covered by the child&apos;selement in widowed mother^ allowance this would cover some half million singleparents, including 100,000 fathers.   Over 200,000 of these families are on supplementary benefit.   These would normally gain nothing in financial terms,but importance is attached both generally and by the Finer Committee to reducingthe extent of dependence on supplementary benefit.   And it does of course help toreduce the cost,2.    Like the present family allowances, the rate for the first child would be 1,50.   It would be subject to normal income tax and to the normal degree of&quot;clawback&quot; through reduction of the tax allowances.3, On the introduction of the new scheme of child allowances in 1977, &quot;the proposedallowance would be dealt with in one of three wayss-(l)    If the rate of child allowance were fixed at  2.20 or more, the proposed(2)    If the rate of child allowance is not high enough to permit this, oneparent families paying tax might be left a bit worse off in cash terms in 1977 than in 1976; or(3)    Some preference for one parent families could be left within the child allowances scheme at a continuing cost of maybe  2-5 million a year.4.    There are some practical problems to solve about the administration of thescheme but, given a simple scheme, it is thought to be operationally feasible ifthe necessary temporary accommodation can be provided in time.   This question isbeing pursued urgently.5.    The net Exchequer cost of the scheme in 1976-77        ^e       million.   It isnot yet possible to make precise estimates of staff and administrative cost, butthe number of staff required for the duration of the scheme is thought likely tobe of the order of 500, at an administrative cost of about  1^- million, making an exchequer cost of  9 million in all.allowance could be discontinued without any family being worse off in cash terms.
