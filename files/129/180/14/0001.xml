THIS DOCUMENT IP THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S government(7T)139 COPY NO fio21+ November 197UCABINET   ,\ &apos; /JI.R.A. TERRORISM IN GREAT BRITAINMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome department.       In my statement to the House on 22nd November, following the bomb explosions in Birmingham the previous night, j ,;promised to make a further statement on 25th November about,emergency provisions which might be enacted later in the week.The Annex contains an account of the Bill which I hope it maybe possible to introduce on Wednesday and pass through all its stages on Thursday.2.      The two main measures which have been discussed sinceIoRoAp attacks in Great Britain began in March 1973 areprovisions to proscribe the I0R.A0 and provisions to give more effective control over travel between Ireland and Great Britain.I, like my predecessor, have not hitherto felt that the value to the police of such provisions would be sufficient tojustify these exceptional measures and the considerablediversion of effort which they involve.     I now think, however,after discussion with the Commissioner of Police of the metropolis and his senior officers (and his view of this hasthe support of other chief officers), that we should nowlegislate on both matters.3.      As regards proscription, it docs not significantlyassist the police to make it an offence to &quot;be a member&apos; of aproscribed organisation.     There are, as experience in bothparts of Ireland has shown, difficulties about proof of membership;   and it is a disadvantage, from the point of viev;of obtaining intelligence, to have to deal with a multitude- 1 -
of ephemeral &quot;bodies instead of one established organisation.It would, moreover, be possible to prohibit the public displayof berets,banners and other insignia, and the raising of funds for a proscribed organisation, without making it an offence tobe a member of such an organisation.     On the other hand,&apos; a prohibition on membership would be welcomed by public opinion,and would help in discouraging people from taking the law into their own hands.     It would also be difficult to explain why,if an organisation is proscribed, membership of it should notbe an offence.     My conclusion is that the arguments are istrongly in favour of making membership of a proscribed organ-isatIon an offence.     My colleagues should, however, be aware that the police will be unable to devote a major part of.; theireffort towards the prosecution of individual members.ii.      A watertight control over movement between Ireland andGreat Britain is not practicable.     The attempt to impose itwould mean at the least the full apparatus of immigration control? based on passports or other documentation, and litwould !be both expensive and difficult to justify the diversion of effort for a problematical result.     I am, however, persuadedthat the hand of the police in cxaming both incoming andoutgoing travellers should be strengthened in order to deal withthe movement of terrorists in and out of Great Britain,  (whether to or from the Republic or Northern Ireland).     The scheme outlined in the Annex would enable comprehensive control tobe established if this were ever found advantageous, but theintention is that the system should be worked on a spot^-checkbasis.;    It will be managed by the police, in the interests of security, to enable them to subject. $A search and close,questioning anyone whom they might suspect of involvement interrorist activities. ;5.      Exclusion orders (following the precedent in thePrevention of Violence (Temporary Provisions) Act 1939) willbe provided for in the Bill,     They will enable preventiveaction to be taken against people who appear to the Secretaryof State to be involved with terrorism (i.e. concerned; in thecommission, preparation or instigation of acts of tcrrprism)but against whom it is not possible to bring charges under thepresent lav/.     Orders can be made both to prevent plotters-from coming here and to expel them when found herey but it isnot expected that they will be made in large numbers. -Provision will be made for representations to the Secretary ofState by the person affected.     There will be severe penalties for defiance of an exclusion order.2 -
6.      As indicated., I see no advantage in aiming at a fullpassport-type control.     Nor do I see advantage in a systemof identity cards, which apart from creating difficulties for ordinary people would he extremely expensive and largelyineffective.7,       I find, however, from my discussions with the policethat the feature of present arrangements which they find &apos;inhibiting is that they cannot lawfully detain peoplesuspected of &quot;being involved in terrorism for long enough to check their identity against other evidence available to them as   result of earlier incidents.     I therefore propose thatthe&apos;police - throughout the country and not only at ports of entry-:- should have powers of search and detention in thefirst place for U8 hours and, on specific Home Office authority,up to:7 days.8,    &apos;&apos;. We are in greater danger of justifiable criticism.&apos; if wedo top little than if we do too much.     We must, moreover,take action which is firm enough to pre-empt action by self-appoirited vigilantes.     It goes almost without saying thatwe must guard against the danger of being driven to more andmore extreme measures involving unwarranted infringement of personal liberty.     I am proposing that the Bill should., apply only fqr 6 months, and that renewal should be subject tp//affirmative resolution.     I hope my colleagues, and the; House,will agree that with this safeguard my proposals match thesituation with which we are faced.9,       Subject to points which may arise in detailed examinationof the Bill when it is available, I seek approval to intro-duce it on Wednesday, 2^th November1, with a view to it beingtaken through all stages in both Houses on the following day.The order providing in detail for the control of travel will&quot;be brought into effect:      immediately on Royal Assent. -R H j home Office24th November 197*4-
ANNEXPREVENTION OF TERRORISM (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) BILLPour main powers are conferred by the Bill.Power to Proscribe Organisations1,     The Bill gives the Secretary of State power to proscribeorganisations which appear to him to be concerned in terrorismin the United Kingdom or in promoting or encouraging it. \,TheBill itself will specify the I.R.A. but any additionalproscriptions will be by order.     It will be an offence; to belong to a proscribed organisation or to support s\ich an organisation financially or in other ways.&quot;     The maximmpi&apos;penalty will be six months imprisonment or a  hOO fine or bothon summary conviction and 5 years imprisonment or an unlimitedfine or both on conviction on indictment.     As in the NorthernIreland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973? the possession of documents emanating from a proscribed organisation will&apos; beevidence of guilt:    the safeguards against abuse of thisprovision are that the evidence can be rebutted and thatprosecutions require the fiat of the Attorney-General.2.     It will be an offence, punishable on summary convictionwith a maximum of three months imprisonment or a  200 fineor both, for a person to display in a public place any item of dress or other article in such a way or in such circum-stances as to arouse reasonable apprehension that he is amember of or a supporter of a proscribed organisation^     Itwill thus be an offence to wear clothing or armbands whichare plainly I.R.A. insignia but which fall short of tlierequirements for a successful prosecution under the provisionsof the Public Order Act 1936, which prohibits the wearing ofpolitical uniforms;   and it will be an offence to carrybanners in support of the I.R.A. \Exclusion Orders .3.     This part of the Bill is based on the Prevention of violence (Temporary Provisions) Act 1939, under which theSecretary of State could make prohibition or expulsion ordersprohibiting people from being in or expelling them from GreatBritain.     Provision is made in the Bill for one type of order (an exclusion order) which would be used both to keeppeople out of Great Britain and to expel people already here.- 1 -
The Secretary of State may exercise these powers to preventacts of terrorism, wherever committed, designed to influencepublic opinion or Government policy with respect to affairs in Northern Ireland.ho     An exclusion order may he made against a person if itappears to the Secretary of State that he is concerned inthe commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terror-ism or is attempting or may attempt to enter Great britain for that purpose, or has harboured such a person or any personagainst whom an exclusion order has been made.     An ordercannot be made against a citizen of the United Kingdom*of colonies who is and has been for the last twenty yearsordinarily resident in Great Britain.     It is to be an offence,subject to the same penalties as membership of a proscribedorganisation, for a person to fail to comply with an order which has been served on him or knowingly to facilitate/ the entry, into Great Britain of a person subject to an exclusionorder,or knowingly to harbour such a person.     A personagainst whom an exclusion order has been made will be able tomake representations to the Secretary of State against-theOrder.Powers of Arrest or Detention5.     The Bill will empower a constable to arrest withoutwarrant a person who he reasonably suspects to be a person concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation ofacts of terrorism, a person subject to an exclusion order, ora person who has knowingly harboured a terrorist.     The policewill be able to detain for 1+8 hours (and for five more dayswith the consent of the Secretary of State) and to finger-print! a person arrested under these powers or for a majoroffence under the Bill.6,     These powers will, among other things, enable the police to hold a suspected terrorist while they question him,investigate his background and check his fingerprints against their;records.     Under the law as it stands the police canarrest a person on suspicion that he has committed a specificarresiable offence but there are limits (not clearly defined)to the length of time which they can hold him.     The newpower,; enabling a man to be detained for up to seven days on general suspicion of involvement in terrorism, is unprecedentedin peacetime in Great Britain.
Control Over Travel7,     The Bill empowers the Secretary of State to make anorder providing for the control of travel into and out ofGreat Britain and for the appointment of examining officers(who would in practice generally be police officers, but who could also be immigration officers) to operate the control.The order would confer powers of arrest, detention and searchon examining officers.8.     The practical effect of this part of the Bill is to givethe police powers to exercise a security control over allpassengers entering and leaving Great Britain for Ireland.At present they exercise surveillance at the ports concernedhut they, have no special powers to question or search travellerThe new powers, which are modelled on those in the ImmigrationAct 1971. will &apos;     in the first instance at any rate be&apos;exercised selectively.Duration of the Act9.     The Bill provides for the expiry of the provisions sixmonths after they become law but the Secretary of State may .provide, by order, which is to be subject to affirmative resolution, for them to continue in force for further periods of six months.- 3 -
