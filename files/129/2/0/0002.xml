THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRETCP. (45) 152.7th September, 1945.GABINET.RELATIONS WITH EIRE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I PEEL that the time has come when we should take stock of our position inrelation to Eire and try to work out some general lines of guidance on policy forDepartments here to follow.I attach, at annex 1, a survey of the position which the United kingdom representative to Eire, Sir John Maffey, recently sent to the Dominions Office.I attach also, at annex 2, a note prepared in the Dominions Office giving someaccount of the salient points in this country&apos;s relations with Eire during recentyears. I hope that these two documents will supply the background for this paper.The chief factors in the situation at present seem to me to be the following : There is a strong if latent feeling of resentment in this country againstEire&apos;s attitude during the war. This may perhaps not be enduring, since it isnot a British habit to bear undying grudges. But at the present time it might easily be provoked into active hostility if a sudden change were made in thepresent policy of distant relations with Eire. For the moment American opiniongenerally is alienated from Eire, and Eire cannot hope, as in the past, to embarrass us by counting, on American sympathy in complaints against Britain.But there is always the danger, and there will certainly be the attempt on the partof Eire to arouse American sympathies over the partition issue, and we mustbe careful not to add to this risk by anything that could reasonably be represented as unfair treatment of Eire.In the Dominions generally, there is a certain sympathy with the Eire pointof view and the right to be neutral, and nationalist opinion, therefore, in theDominions is inclined to support Eire&apos;s independent stand. On the other hand,we must not, by too readily condoning Eire&apos;s neutrality, encourage the growth of a similar spirit in other parts of the Commonwealth.Generally, it can be truly said that never in our history have we here beenin such a strong position in relation to world opinion so far as Ireland isconcerned, and Eire&apos;s position has never been weaker. We should be very careful not to lose this great advantage.The strategic, geographical and economic interests of the two islands are obviously closely linked, and provided causes of friction and dispute can beminimised, the natural tendency to friendly relations is bound to develop.From the trade point of view, this country is the only market for Eire&apos;sexports of food-stuffs while Eire affords a useful market for manufactured goods from Britain.   Good trade relations are thus of clear benefit to both.In the strategic field the lack of facilities for ships and aircraft on theWest and South-West of Ireland proved a very serious danger during someperiods of the war. This danger would have been still more serious had it notbeen for the facilities that were readily made available in Northern Ireland.The strategic requirements for the future may need revision in the light of modern developments, but subject- to this our ultimate aim should clearly be to try to associate Ireland with the defence system of Britain. Any approach inthis direction, however, is most unlikely to be successful at the present time.We shall be met, as we were before the war, with a demand for the solution &quot;first of the partition issue. But having regard to the vital necessity which we found[30474] &apos; copy No.00
ANNEX 1.The Irish Question in 19-15.Memorandum by Sir John Maffey.Fundamentally, for reasons known to history, the quarrel lies between menof English and Irish race.   The Scotch and the Welsh are only on the fringe of it.Arthur Griffith, when asked what was the Foreign Policy of Sinn Fein,said, &quot; On any international issue, find out on which side the English stand.Ireland will be found on the other side.&quot;In this spirit Eire has remained obstinately aloof while we have toiledthrough these hard years of war. This suggests an awkward confrontationbetween Dublin and London now that peace has come, and warm feelings are notpossible. The fact, however, is that the Irish question now confronts us in asimpler and more manageable form than ever before, though some of the reasonsfor this may not be palatable to the Englishman who hankers after that myth,a friendly Ireland.The chief reason is that Eire&apos;s nationalist and separatist status is nowdefinitely established. This has been the constant &quot;secret stream&quot; in herhistory. Gladstonian Home Rule would have led us to where we are to-day.though perhaps with fewer unpleasant shocks.Neutrality was decided upon by the Nationalists and they had warned us mainly in order to establish the fact that there was no sort of loyal adherence to be expected by England from Ireland as of right. To-day, after six years&apos;detachment, Eire is more than ever a foreign country. It is so dominated bythe National Catholic Church as to be almost a theocratic State. Gaelic isenforced in order to show that Eire is not one of the English-speaking nations.&quot; foreign games are frowned upon, the war censorship has been misappliedfor anti-British purposes, anti-British feeling is fostered in school and byChurch and State by a system of &apos;&apos; hereditary enemy &apos;&apos; indoctrination. There isprobably more widespread anti-British sentiment in Eire to-day than ever before.The human links (British garrison. &amp;c.) have gone.   Young minds are mouldedfor facilities in Northern Ireland during the war, it would clearly be impossiblefor us to surrender those facilities or to take any action in relation to NorthernIreland which might endanger them.The conclusion which I suggest should be drawn from the above, is thatwe should, from now on, endeavour, by steady but not dramatic moves, to rebuildand restore friendly relations between the two islands. We should not openlycondone Eire&apos;s neutrality, but we should not lose any opportunity in which, inour own interests as well as in those of Eire, closer links between the islandscan be established.As a first step I suggest that the departments concerned might review thefuture requirements of trade between the two islands, including the financial problems involved as a result of the war, and try to work out a plan which canbe discussed with Eire representatives informally and agreed with them, not inthe shape of a formal agreement but rather as a working arrangement. Thiswould also cover the question of supplies to Eire which we should make availableto the fullest extent joossible without damage to our own interest.We could also, as occasion offers, restore the practice, suspended, during thewar, of bringing Eire into inter-Commonwealth bodies and meetings dealingwith technical or special problems of common concern such as civil aviation ortelecommunications.We should review the strategic requirements so that, if at some later timean opportunity should offer of discussing defence facilities with Eire (for example in connection with some plan for regional security in Western Europe) we shouldbe in a position to take advantage of it.I have endeavoured to set out above the main elements of the problem as i see them and my suggestions for immediate action in the matter. I hope thatthese wall commend themselves to my colleagues as a general line of guidancefor all Government Departments here.A.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,7th September, 1945.
to hate an abstraction, England. Irish politics live on this racket, and Irelandendeavours to poison the ear of the world against us. If accused of deserting thecause of democracy and liberty, Ireland replies by pointing to England and thecrime of Partition.It will therefore be understood that resentment in England on the score of eire&apos;s neutrality is no matter of regret here.. Rather the reverse. Nothinghelped Mr. de Valera more than Mr. ChurchiiFs personal attack.The Irish are a very distinct race, and their marked characteristics persiststrongly. An Englishman who did not know Ireland and who studied in any country town the faces, the names over the shops, the procession to Mass on aHoly Day, would know at once that he was in a foreign land. There still persistthe dark Milesian strain, the tribal vendetta spirit, hatred and blarney, religiousfanaticism, swift alternations between cruelty and laughter. A knowledge of theNorth-West Frontier tribes of India is a good introduction to an unstanding of the Irish. They are both very remarkable and in many ways attractive people,with the same mental kinks. We were wise enough not to attempt to bring theAfridis under our direct rule.Foreign people have always been able to understand the Irish better than wecan. When La Salle visited Ireland in 1689 in the train of James II, he recordedthe following observation :  &apos;&apos; Les Irlandais sont ennemis irreconciliables des Anglais en sorte que sion leur lachait la main ils egorgeraient en peu de temps ceux qui sont icy.&quot;That dictum is not yet out of date.In 1848, John Mitchel, one of the Young Ireland rebel group, as a convict inVan Diemen&apos;s land, wrote in his &quot;Jail Journal&quot; &quot;Give war in our time, OLord.&quot; John Mitchel was an Ulster Presbyterian and a man of culture, and istherefore an interesting example of how rebels are made.To any Englishman who wonders why our relations with Ireland have been so unhappy, and how mild people like William Cosgrave came to &quot; shoot up &quot;British regiments in 1916, I commend the study of John MitcheFs Jail Journal.This is far better than a course of Lecky, who wrote prejudiced and partialhistory. It is mental pathology rather than history which provides the clue toevents here. John Mitchel reveals the Irish mind and its black hatreds undera microscope. The book has a special and grave significance to-day, as it is usedin all primary and secondary schools in Eire to mould young minds.In Dublin to-day great preparations are afoot for celebrating the centenaryof the Young Ireland rebels. The design is that hatred should not die. TheFianna Fail party, which has an overall majority in the Dail to-day, derivedits prestige from the 1916 rebellion and still more f5r plunging the country intocivil war in their fight against the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Political leaders ofto-day wish to live in history as the heroes of Ireland s greatest hour, whenEngland was overthrown in battle. On this legend young Ireland is being-suckled.Mr. de Valera is not himself a hater of England, as Mr. Frank Aiken, theFinance Minister, is. In the dark days of July 1940 Mrs. Frank Aiken, sittingnext to me at lunch at my own table, remarked : &quot; You all thought that 1914-18was Der Tag.  No, this is Der Tag.&quot;There is very little of the Irishman in Mr. de Valera. He is trusted becauseof his austerity and his cold mathematical approach to Anglo-Irish problems.He understands the narrowness of the Irish mind and does not venture on tobroader paths, though he might certainly have led his people out of spiritualbondage in 1941, when America came into the war. But he had drawn the swordin the civil war against the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921 and Eire&apos;s neutralityis evidence of the independence he claims to have won and justification to hisconscience, perhaps, for the lead he gave in that fratricidal strife. So he stoodhis ground on neutrality and his call of condolence at the German Legation onHitler&apos;s death was meant to emphasise Eire&apos;s detachment.   Q.E.D.It is best for the Englishman to accept all this philosophically and to bethankful under four heads (a) that we are finally quit of the task of trying to administer Ireland,where, though we gained no credit and some discredit, we probablydid as well as, or better than, anybody else could have done;(&amp;) that we have got through this war without help from Eire, in spite ofthe loss of the ports, and that it is thereby established, to Eire&apos;schagrin, that we can get along without them;[30474] B 2
(c) that if we continue to behave with due forbearance, not talking too muchand leaving others to judge the moral issue, Eire will come badly outof all this in the eyes of the world, and that her power for mischiefagainst us (e.g., making the American welkin ring with her woes)will be greatly reduced;(d) that we can now talk to Eire on a cold, factual, horse-trading basis,knowing perfectly well that the cards are in our hands. All the reallynecessary bridges between our two islands can be built up on a cleaneconomic basis, and on this a happier and healthier relationship withthe widest implications and associations can in time be established.2. Eire&apos;s Neutrality.Some of the benefits flowing from the new relationship above indicated havebeen available to us during the course of the war, though owing to lively resent-ment on the British side and to censorship on the Irish side the true position hasnot been appreciated.Leaving aside the difficulty about the ports, the history of Irish neutrality is far from being a black record. For the first time in history the British cabinet have been able to conduct a long war without any anxiety about Ireland. Comparethe war of 1914-18. when Ireland was still in the United Kingdom. We had tokeep a big garrison in. Ireland. We had to suppress a rebellion. We suffereddeep humiliation. German intrigue was rampant. Roger Casement was landedby a German submarine. The full story of espionage and submarine links havenever been fully told.The fact that we have fared better this time in such matters is not becausethe Eire Government was friendly, but because the Eire Government was neutraland has never been allowed to forget for one instant that Eire&apos;s immunity couldnot last a day if she became, a base for German intrigue. Consequently, when any german activity developed. I was the first to be informed. Gradually a certaingeographical interpretation of neutrality was developed (often under pressure,e.g., to procure the non-internment of our R.A.F. joersonnel), bringing facilities which I need not detail here. They included rigid surveillance of the GermanLegation, the impounding of their wireless transmitter and close understanding with the British Intelligence Service. In this underground of espionage andintrigue a British authority in Ireland could never achieve what was achieved bya native authority.   &quot; The dog of the country hunts the hare of the country.&quot;Meanwhile, we got recruits, labourers and supplies from Eire, not from anymotive or policy of friendship, but from the operation of commonsense and self-interest.3. Adverse Factors in Eire&apos;s Neutrality.That Eire&apos;s neutrality had its dark side is apparent from what has been already said. It has driven a wedge and has definitely been used in order to drive a wedge between Ireland and England.It must be admitted that, by ascribing Dominion status to Eire, we placed inunfriendly hands a power to weaken the conception and responsibilities ofDominion status. Eire has none of the attributes of a Dominion. She is a&quot; Scotland &quot; gone wrong, and we cannot afford to let her be completely divorced from the strategic and economic zone of England, Scotland and Wales.4. More remote advantages from Eire&apos;s Neutrality.Our forbearance and patience have had a subtle effect on the Irish mind.With a somewhat uneasy conscience the Irish realise that we kept them goingwhen we ourselves were hard-pressed. There is now a big question-mark againstthe &quot; 700 years of aggression.&quot;Ireland&apos;s power to mobilise Irish pressure groups in America and elsewherehas been greatly reduced permanently reduced if we play our hand patiently,remembering that for the outside world Dark Rosaleen has a sex appeal, whereasBritannia is regarded as a maiden aunt.Mr. de Valera&apos;s rejection of American requests, his protest against the landing of American troops in Northern Ireland, his refusal to expel the Axisrepresentatives, &amp;c, have reduced Ireland&apos;s credit with the Allied nations.
Mr. de Valera&apos;s recent somewhat futile statement that Eire is a Republicwas coupled with a clear indication the first he has given that he has no intention of severing association with the British Crown. This indicates a growing realisation of the danger Eire runs of losing their &quot; Club membership &quot;if they overplay their hand.5. More remote adverse [actors.It is too early to assess the extent of the losses due to this period ofestrangement. Eire has looked about for new friends. America has been eagerto jump in to exploit the situation to the benefit of her civil aviation programme.I find it hard to regard the development of Foynes-Rineanna as anything buta grave menace to Britain&apos;s whole position as a hub of world communications.We have looked on and done nothing about this.Neighbourly and personal links between Ireland and England in the profes-sional and business world (medical, legal, Imperial services, insurance, trades union, &amp;c.) have been greatly weakened. Six years of neutrality, postal censor-ship and travel restrictions have had a great effect in throwing Ireland backon to herself. All this no doubt means loss to. Ireland, except in so far as theisolationist craving for self-sufficiency is gratified. But there is a loss for usin prospect, as the Irishman has always made a distinct contribution to Britishtradition and achievement all over the world in common citzenship with us, andseems to reach his greatest height outside his own country. There is a danger that we may lose still more if the policy of nagging at Eire is continued. Special,attention should be given to the nature of replies given in the House of commons to M.P.S such as Professor Savory and Dr. Little, whose ambition is satisfied ifthey can provoke ill-will between London and Dublin.The right note was sounded by Sir William, now Lord, Jowitt in a speechhe made on the 24th June, 1943. I was impressed with this at the time and tookan extract, which is attached as Appendix A.In spite of all that has happened we should endeavour to rebuild the kinshipof the British Isles. The loss of the vitalising element which Ireland has broughtto us would impair our national health and welfare in many ways.6. The Future.Regional defence schemes for Western Europe and the advent of the atomicbomb may have rendered completely irrelevant ali the strategic arguments whichhave hitherto complicated the Irish question. Indeed, we are probably already at the stage when, from the point of view of our island defences, we can tellDublin that we do not mind what-Dublin does. The conditions under which wecould in future tolerate foreign legations in Dublin seemed to me till very recentlyto present a difficult problem. If this problem disappears, then the question ofour relationship with Ireland becomes even simpler than was suggested at theopening of this note.Meanwhile, the eternal question of Partition continues to poison the Irishatmosphere. It is used to stir up ill-will against us&quot;in the world. It will causeguns to go off in Ireland once again. The Catholics of the North will call oatto the Catholics of the South, saying : &quot; We are only doing what you did in 1918.Are you going to leave us in the lurch ? &quot;Partition, being now proclaimed as a justification for Eire.&apos;s neutrality.Partition is to be played up in the world for all it is worth. The elaborateCatholic pamphlet &quot;Orange Terror.&quot; posted to any address in the world for2s. Qd. in 1943, is a sign of the times. Frequent resolutions by Irish-Americanbodies are not without significance. The American Minister in Dublin is convinced that a campaign is being actively planned.Unhappily it is not possible for us to feel satisfied with the state of affairs in Northern Ireland. The Unionist Government are fighting an insidious enemywho is gaining upon them. Their ballot box is not safe over a period against the catholic birth-rate. The loyalty of the local garrison is not proof against the attractions of a lower income-tax rate in Eire. They are vulnerable to worldcriticism. The British Government cannot afford to ignore the pronouncementmade in November 1944 by the Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, the-Most Rev. Dr. Griffin, that &quot; there is religious persecution at the present day in Northern Ireland.&quot;
Let me make it clear that if I were a Protestant or Presbyterian resident inNorthern Ireland, nothing would induce me to accept citizenship under a DublinGovernment. If I were forced to tread that plank, loyalty to Britain would necessarily be impaired. The idea that Northerners forced into the South wouldleaven the South with British loyalties is childish. Mr. de Valera has thrownthat fly over me in vain. The whole question is one than can best be consideredapart from this note.7. Negotiations between-the United Kingdom and Eire.There is one word to be said about negotiations with Eire in general. On no account should Irish statesmen be summoned to London for discussions, on matters of importance not previously agreed. From Dublin they go forth aswarriors to fight the battle of Ireland against England. They are aware thatno British Government likes to admit a failure or breakdown in negotiations.The Irish bargaining position in London is strong.8. Trade.It has been suggested that a sane and sound relationship between the twoislands can best be achieved by allowing full play to the economic factors which provide the basic and natural bonds of union between the two islands. The tradi-tional trade relationship of Ireland with Great Britain has become largely amatter for exchanging live animals and foodstuffs for industrial goods. The linesupon which each country has developed and ease of transport make this arrange-ment satisfactory to &apos; both. The smallness of Eire&apos;s population (under3 millions) renders mass production uneconomic, but the country needs a wide range of reasonably priced products which can be got advantageously from Britishfactories. This is an unwelcome conclusion to those people in Eire whose ideaof paradise is a Gaelic sanctuary, independent of British trade links and whowould even accept a reduced scale of livelihood based on self-sufficiency and onmaximum protection to local manufacturers. This doctrine of self-sufficiencyinspires the political utterances even of responsible Ministers in Dublin, butthere is a wide gulf between the platform and the market place.In 1938. the last normal year, Eire&apos;s total exports were roughly  23,800,000of which the United Kingdom took over  22,000,000. In 1944 Eire&apos;s exports were  29,500,000, of which the United Kingdom took more than  29,000,000.During the period of economic war in 1932-38, Eire&apos;s attempt to build uptrade with the Continent failed completely. There is now no incentive to buyfrom foreign sources, and though war conditions have naturally opened up someunusual channels, these are not likely to remain open.As a matter of amour propre and because of the difficulties suffered in the war,Eire has plans for developing her own Mercantile Marine. We must expect afalling off under this head of our business here. Development of turf and water-power may also reduce the coal import figures.There is a new factor which now dominates the whole field of economicrelationship between Eire and the United Kingdom. As a result of her wartimecredits Eire is imprisoned in a sterling cage. She has accumulated large sterlingresources and in this way a huge claim on British exports has been built up. Itwill not be easy for us to satisfy these claims so long as British exports are subject to priorities and limitations. It will be even more difficult to exchangeairy large proportion of Eire&apos;s sterling assets into the dollar and hard currencyrequirements for which she will press. From now on Eire must look to us forsuch favourable consideration as we can afford to give, and our home market oughtto derive benefit from having Eire as a prosperous customer eager to convert hisbank balance into British manufactures and not able to look elsewhere for hisrequirements.(Signed) J. L. MAFFEY.21st August, 1945.
Appendix A.Sir William Jowitt on Eire (24 A June, 1943).&quot; The Government of Eire alone took a different line (sc. &apos; to the otherDominions &apos;). Notwithstanding a policy of appeasement which seemed to becarried to a point of madness in the surrender, at a time which was dark with theclouds of war, of the Southern ports, to which we had rights by virtue of theTreaty, notwithstanding an unprovoked and wanton attack on the Catholicpeoples of Poland, Eire has preferred to declare herself neutral, and to sufferenemy Legations to remain in the city of Dublin. It is for her to decide whatpolicy best suits her interest and dignity. At the same time&apos; it is satisfactory to note that thousands of men from the South of Ireland are once more serving inour fighting forces.&quot;&quot;Yet the defection was serious and might well have been disastrous.History will judge of the rights and wrongs of this matter. It is not,easy in afew short years to heal the wounds arising from centuries of distrust.&quot;&quot;Yet I could wish that Eire had found it possible to escape from theimprisonment of the past and open the window and look out to a happier future.She bends her activities in these tremendous years to the re-introduction of theIrish tongue because she regards the use of the English language as the badge ofher conquest.  Time will show, and time, I trust, will heal.&quot;From the oration on the occasion of the 119th anniversary of the foundation of Birkbeck College, London University, delivered by- Sir WilliamJowitt, Minister without Portfolio, on the 24th June, 1943.ANNEX 2.Note on Relations between the United Kingdom and Eire during recent Years.In 1937 and 1938 the United Kingdom Government made a determined effort to clear up the outstanding difficulties and disputes with Eire which hadembarrassed relations between the two countries since Mr. de Valera first took office in 1932.On the constitutional side Mr. de Valera had followed rigidly the policywhich he had first adopted in opposition to the Treaty of 1921 under the title of &quot; External Association.&quot; His interpretation of this was that Eire would bea State with a republican constitution for internal purposes, but would, for external purposes, be associated with the British Commonwealth, and for thatpurpose would accept The King as the symbol of that association. In 1937 hehad completed his constitutional changes by the introduction of the Constitutionof Eire which now exists and had coupled this with an Act authorising certainformal Acts in external affairs to be conducted in the name of The King. this position was considered by the United Kingdom Government in consultation withthe Dominion Governments both by correspondence and at the meeting of PrimeMinisters at the Imperial Conference of 1937. As a result it was decided toaccept the new Constitution as not effecting a fundamental alteration in theposition of Eire as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and astatement to this effect was issued at the end. of 1937.Shortly afterwards the United Kingdom Government entered into negotia-tions with Mr. de Valera for the settlement of the financial and economic disputewhich had continued since 1932. This was achieved by the conclusion of a financial agreement under which Eire paid  10 million in settlement of a claim of  100 million and a trade agreement which, in effect, kept the United kingdom market open to agricultural produce from Eire in return for substantial conces-sions to manufactured goods from the United Kingdom on import into Eire. Anagreement was also reached at the same time under which the United KingdomGovernment gave up their claim under the treaty of 1921 to facilities in Eirein. the event of war, and the retention of certain defended ports on a care andmaintenance basis in time of peace. It was hoped that, as a result of this, the active co-operation of Eire in a future war might be obtained thoughMr. de Valera was not at the time prepared to go further than to give anemphatic undertaking not to allow Eire to be used as a base for attack upon this country.
When the war broke out in 1939 attempts were made to persuadeMr. de Valera to co-operate fully with this country. He decided to maintain a policy of neutrality though adhering to his undertaking not to allow Eireto be used as a base against this country. Throughout the course of the war thisformal policy of neutrality was firmly maintained by him. Mr. de Valeria was,however, prepared from time to time to afford facilities when asked for, in sofar as they could be given without an overt breach of neutrality. Perhaps themost striking example is that, after some years of pressure, he finally agreed to release from internment all British and Allied airmen who had made forcedlandings in Eire during the war while retaining in internment all Germans ina similar position. He also placed no bar on the departure to this country of volunteers for service in the United Kingdom forces. He also maintained astrict watch on the activities of the German Minister and any Germans in Eireand allowed his officers to maintain informal contact with United Kingdomsecurity officers.After the entry of the United States into the war on the occasion of thefirst arrival of United States forces in Northern Ireland, Mr. de Valera issued a protest against this United States action. Subsequently he rejected a UnitedStates request (supported by this country) for the dismissal of the GermanLegation. He thus still maintained until the end of the war the general positionof neutrality even at the expense of a serious loss of American sympathy on whichEire has in the past relied in any disputes with this country.Recently, in reply to a supplementary question in the Dail, Mr. de Valerasaid that Eire was a republic. &quot;He subsequently, in two lengthy statements,explained that he did not mean that any change had taken place since theConstitution of 1937. He explained that he regarded the 1937 Constitution as constituting a republic, but emphasised the intention of the Eire Government tomake use in external affairs of the powers conferred for certain documents to beissued in the King&apos;s name. These two statements do not, in our view, involve any change from the position which we formally accepted in 1937.
