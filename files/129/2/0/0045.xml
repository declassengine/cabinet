Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECEET. Copy No.CP. (45) 195.2Qth September, 1945.CABINET.SECRET SESSIONS OF PARLIAMENT.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.I was asked last month by the Clerk of the House of Commons whether theGovernment would agree to the general publication of the Journals of the house for the War Sessions 1939 to 1945. Unlike &quot; Votes and Proceedings &quot; or&quot;Hansard,&quot; the Journals record all proceedings in secret session, and though there was no express ban on the publication of the Journals it was thoughtduring the war that their publication would be inconsistent with the maintenanceof the secrecy of such proceedings.2. The entries relating to the secret sessions are brief and largely formal,dealing in the main with the time and place of meeting of the House, and I was satisfied that there was no longer any reason to object to publication for securityreasons. The only point of difficulty arose over the entry relating to a Reportof the Committee of Privileges on a privilege case involving an alleged breach of secrecy of a Member of Parliament. The publication of the Journals wouldreveal this for the first time and with it the identity of the Member; although he was exonerated, it might be embarrassing to him. This did not, however, seemin itself to be a sufficient reason for objecting to the publication of the Journals.3. The Prime Minister shared this view, and informed the Leader of theOpposition, who also had no objection to publication. We thought, however,that it would be right to tell the Member concerned in the privilege case of whatwas proposed. I accordingly had a conversation with him. It was clear thathe did not much care for the idea of publication, but he appeared to appreciate that this was the right course on general grounds. He maintained, however, that publication of the Journals, without publication of the Report of the Committeeof Privileges giving a fuller account of the charge against him and of bisexoneration, would be unfair, and he suggested that in the published Journals his name should be omitted.4. After consultation with the Clerk of the House of Commons, I am satisfied that this step, which would require an Order of the House, could notvery well be taken. The alternative would appear to be the publication of theReport of the Committee of Privileges, and I think that this provides the best solution.5. As things are at present there are two obstacles to this course. As theReport was printed for circulation to Members only, was discussed in secret session, and accordingly remains subject to the sanctions against disclosure ofsuch proceedings, it would be necessary to obtain an Order of the House removing the ban on the disclosure of the proceedings in this case. The other obstacle is,Defence Regulation 3 (2), which makes it an offence to publish any report of, or topurport to describe the proceedings at, any secret session, except such report or description thereof as may be officially communicated through the Press andCensorship Bureau.[30602]
0. On the first point, the Clerk tells me that the necessary Parliamentarysteps would be : -(1) An.Order of the House should be obtained for reprinting the Reportof the Committee of Privileges.(2) The same Order might contain leave for the disclosure of the proceedingsrelative to this case, notwithstanding that they were in secret session.7. So that there may be no misunderstanding about the position of the member concerned in the privilege case, the Clerk suggests that in the Journalat the appropriate place there might be inserted a suitable cross reference to theReport of the Committee of Privileges making the fact of exoneration clear.8. At the same time the Clerk suggested that the Government might wishto consider the general question of removing both the Parliamentary and theDefence Regulation ban on the disclosure of proceedings in war-time secretsessions. The arguments in favour of this course which, as it happens, wouldalso dispose of the privilege case are :  (1) There are no longer any security grounds of substance against suchdisclosure. That is at any rate my own impression of the varioussecret sittings I attended, and I think I was at all the importantones.(2) The ban will become increasingly difficult to enforce both in parliament and outside. Even now it is hard to say with regard to anyparticular piece of information whether it was communicated in secret or not. As regards Parliament itself, there is also, of course,the technical difficulty that an objection to a particular statement on the ground that it discloses proceedings in secret session cannotavoid being in itself a disclosure of proceedings in secret session.What is more, the desire to enforce the ban will quickly weakenand eventually disappear.(3) The ban will sooner or later have to be raised for the sake of history.It is better that this should happen as the result of a deliberatedecision of Parliament and Government than through failure toenforce it.9. Similar considerations presumably apply to the House of Lords. Thenecessary steps for lifting the ban vrould be (1) A resolution passed by each House of Parliament.(2) The revocation of Defence Regulation 3 (2).When these steps had been taken, it would still be possible, if the need arose, to meet in secret on particular occasions, and, as a safeguard of the secrecy of such proceedings, there would be the sanction of Parliamentary privilege.10. I feel sure that the time has come to lift the war-time ban, and I ask my colleagues to authorise me to discuss the matter with the Speaker andto agree that, subject to his views, we should proceed on the above lines. since this is essentially a non-party question, I should also propose to inform theOpposition of the Government&apos;s intentions and invite their concurrence.H. M.Privy Council Office, S.W- 1,2Qth September, 1945.
