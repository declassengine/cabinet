Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET. Copy No.   cp. (45) 182.19th September, 1945.t&amp; CABINET.THE DODECANESE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate the attached note for the information of my colleagues and of theChiefs of Staff.     -Note.In opposing at the Council of Foreign Ministers an immediate decision onthe cession of the Islands to Greece and their demilitarisation, M. Molotovprobably has in mind a process of blackmail so that eventually, perhaps after theGreek elections, a more amenable Government in Greece would agree to a Russianbase in the Dodecanese as the price of cession.2. We, on the other hand, have every interest in pressing for a speedydecision and no reason to oppose demilitarisation. A failure to get the Islandsfor Greece, though they are now in our physical possession, would contrastunfavourably with Russia&apos;s ability to distribute ex-enemy territory to her satel-lites, would lower our prestige in Greece and elsewhere, and would weaken theGreek Government, who are already under attack for their failure to get anythingout of the peace settlement, and who might be unable to carry on if even thisindisputable claim is denied to them.3.   Our policy should therefore be : (i) To press for immediate agreement at this meeting of the Council ofForeign Ministers on the cession of the Islands (including Castellorizo)to Greece and their demilitarisation, saying that any question of theireventual remilitarisation and use as bases should be a matter for theSecurity Control.(ii) If no result is achieved at this meeting, to hand over the de facto adminis-tration of the Islands to Greece, defending our action by the analogy of Russia&apos;s action in handing over Eastern Germany to Poland inadvance of any Allied decision, and by the fact that no opposition tocession to Greece was offered by any Power represented at the Councilof Foreign Ministers.E.
