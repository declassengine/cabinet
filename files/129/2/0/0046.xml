Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited, it is issued for the personal use of .................................................................TOP SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 196.28th September, 1945.CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THREE matters were referred by the Cabinet for further consideration bythe Foreign Secretary, the Lord President and myself in connection with short-term policy in Palestine, namely :  (a) the timing of the approach to the Arab States;(b) the timing and form of an announcement on the subject of Palestinepolicy; and(c) the best way of examining long-term policy.I now submit, for the consideration of our colleagues, our joint recommendations on the questions posed.(a) Timing of the Approach to the Arab States.2. We recommend that the approach to the Arab States should be made at theearliest practicable date and that, since all hope of secrecy will then be at an end,an announcement of His Majesty&apos;s Governments intentions should simultaneouslybe made in Parliament.3. We have two main reasons to urge in support of this recommendation..In the first place, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be in a most invidious positionduring the period until the announcement is made. The recent disclosure by president Truman of the fact that he has been pressing the Prime Minister toagree to immediate large-scale Jewish immigration into Palestine, coupled withthe reports of our own intentions which appear almost daily in the press, will inevitably give rise to questions in the House to which, during this period, it willbe impossible to give any adequate reply. This situation should not be allowedto continue for longer than is absolutely necessary.4. In the second place, the fact has to be faced that the state of internal security in Palestine is so bad that trouble may break out at any time. There is always the danger that disclosures and reports of the kind mentioned in the last paragraph may give rise to a premature explosion among either the Arabs or theJews. It would be unfortunate indeed if any such outbreak were to take place before the announcement was made. In that event, any policy announced would almost certainly be regarded as dictated by the outbreak and, so viewed, inter-interpretations might be put upon it which could not otherwise be advanced.5. For these reasons, we do not consider it possible to postpone the announce-ment until after the Mecca Pilgrimage in mid-November, as suggested by theMiddle East Conference. It may be mentioned, in this connection, that thequestion has been again discussed with His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in theMiddle East and that they now agree that the arguments in favour of an early announcement outweigh those in favour of postponement, the course which theyoriginally recommended.[30597]
6. It would, however, be unwise to take action until the forces necessary tomaintain- order and to quell any possible disturbances are on the spot. The verypresence of these forces will reduce the probability of serious trouble. We con-sider that the date of the announcement should be fixed solely with reference tothe date by which adequate reinforcements will have reached the Middle East.7. The position in this regard is as follows. The Chiefs of Staff considerit necessary that the Division at present in Palestine should be reinforced by two further Divisions. The two latter Divisions are now on the move; one will bein Palestine by the 15th October, while the other should reach the Middle Eastby the 31st October. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff hopes that militaryarrangements may be so far complete as to permit of the announcement being madeon the 24th October, and he is in communication with the General OfficerCommanding in the Middle East as to the possibility of his being ready for itto be made at an even earlier date. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff willsupply an up-to-date appreciation of the situation before the Cabinet meets todiscuss the question.8. There are about 3,000 certificates from the White Paper quota stillunallotted, so that, if the announcement can be made in the middle or during thelatter half of October, any break in immigration due to its exhaustion, if indeedsuch break occurs at all, can only be a very brief one. It should certainly bepossible to conclude the negotiations with the Arab States and to announce theresult before the last immigrants to be admitted under the quota reach Palestine.9. It is proposed that the Government of the United States shall be informed of the course which His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to pursue and of thereasons for it before any announcement is made or the Arab States are approached.Advance information should also be given to the Dominions.10. There has been one incident in connection with the timing of the approach to the Arab States which.we think it desirable to report for theinformation of the Cabinet. We learnt, on the 19th September, that King Faroukof Egypt proposed to convene a meeting of all the Arab Kings and Presidentswithin the next ten days to draw up a joint anti-Zionist declaration, with a viewto giving a demonstration of Arab solidarity on this point so forcible that itcould not be disregarded by the Powers. An invitation to attend the meeting hadbeen sent to and accepted by King Ibn Saud. The reactions of the other Rulersare not yet known.11. There was obviously a danger that the meeting, if held, might pledgeitself to oppose all further Jewish immigration into Palestine and thus give;an appearance of unreality to any subsequent statement by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to the effect that the acquiescence of the Arab States in the continuance of immigration would be sought. On the other hand, it was not thought advisable to attempt to prevent the meeting being held, nor did it seem probable that suchan attempt would be successful, unless definite reasons were given. It is, ofcourse, impossible to divulge those reasons.12. A middle course has therefore been pursued. With the concurrence of the Prime Minister, His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Jedda has been instructedto tell King Ibn Saud, should he pass through or near to Jedda on his way toa meeting either with King Farouk alone or with the other Rulers, that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are contemplating making a communication to him very shortly on the Palestine question. They therefore hope that King Ibn Saudwill be able to secure that no statement will be issued by the meeting of sucha nature as to commit the Arab Rulers irrevocably and thus prejudice in advancetheir consideration of this communication.13. Should the occasion arise to deliver this message, it will be impressed upon King Ibn Saud that it is for his ear alone and that it should in no cir-cumstances be divulged to other parties. It is believed that the King can be trusted to keep the message to himself.(b) Timing and Form of Announcement on Palestine Policy.14. As already stated, once the approach is made to the Arab States, all hope of secrecy will be at an end and it will therefore be desirable for theannouncement to be made simultaneously with the opening of negotiations.
15. The announcement will probably best be made in the form of a parliamentary question and answer. A draft of such a question and answer is appended as Annex I to this memorandum.16. Although, theoretically, Great Britain is not bound to apply for the placing of Palestine under Trusteeship, we do not think that it will becontended that, as a matter of practical politics, she could refrain from doing so.It is therefore proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should definitely statethat it is their intention to make the necessary application. As the ministerial committee pointed out in paragraph 31 of the Chairman&apos;s report, the applicationwill almost inevitably result in His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policy for Palestinebecoming the subject of international discussion and, this being so, the most convenient and expeditious procedure will be to make proposals for a new long-term policy simultaneously with the proposal for a Trusteeship Agreement toreplace the Mandate.17. The last sentence of the first sub-paragraph of the draft reply isintended to reassure the Jews tfhat every effort will be made to give them anopportunity to place their case before the United Nations. The principal arab states are members of the United Nations, but special arrangements will benecessary to ensure a hearing for the Jews.18. A draft of the communication which, at the recent Middle EastConference, it was proposed should be made to the Arab States, is appended as annex II to this memorandum. Its delivery will be synchronised with thestatement in Parliament. It would seem desirable to incorporate in this communication also the sentence referred to in the preceding paragraph. It is applicable not only to the Jews but also to the Palestinian Arabs.(c) Best way of examining Long-term Policy.19. The Ministerial Committee is about to take up the examination ofvarious long-term policies with a view to recommending which of them shouldbe adopted for future application.   It will have before it (a) The present system of governing, without either the consent or theco-operation of the governed.(b) The White Paper proposals, envisaging a unitary Palestinian state with constitutional bodies on which Arabs and Jews would sit inpredetermined proportions.(c) The plan recommended by the Ministerial Committee of 1943-44 which involves the partition of Palestine and the setting up of independentArab and Jewish States.(d) Lord Altrincham&apos;s scheme for an International Trust, with international control of immigration.(e) The scheme which I have circulated to the Committee, which envisagesthe division of Palestine into Arab and Jewish provinces, each witha considerable degree of local autonomy, with a unitary government at the centre.(/) The scheme suggested by the  Foreign  Secretary for  a federationembracing the Arab and Jewish areas of Palestine and Transjordan.It is thought that these six schemes, and their possible variants, virtuallyexhaust all practicable systems of government which might be introduced.20. The Committee will no doubt make its recommendation to the cabinet as soon as possible. After the Cabinet has reached its conclusion, a considerableamount of work will have to be done on the details of any plan approved inprinciple before it will be in a form in which it can be placed before the world organisation with a view to a Trusteeship Agreement being approved. It is theintention that this work shall be pushed on with a view to the necessaryapplication being made as soon as the appropriate organs of the organisationcome into existence and assume their functions.(Initialled) G.

ANNEX I.Draft of proposed Question and Answer in Parliament.Question. To ask the Prime Minister what policy His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment propose to adopt in relation to the future Government of Palestine,particularly having regard to the fact that the immigration quota prescribed inthe White Paper of 1939 is practically exhausted.Reply. His Majesty&apos;s Government have under urgent consideration thequestion of their future long-term policy in Palestine. Having formulated sucha policy, they propose, in accordance with the terms of the San Francisco Charter,to submit it for consideration by the World Organisation when applying for theapproval of the United Nations to an Agreement placing Palestine under trusteeship. This application will be made as soon as possible. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will do their best to ensure that, when the application is underconsideration by the United Nations, all interested parties shall have full opportunity to state their case before the appropriate tribunal.During the interval which must elapse pending the coming into force of aTrusteeship Agreement, His Majesty&apos;s Government will continue to conform tothe existing arrangements, as prescribed in the White Paper of 1939, in respectof Jewish immigration into Palestine. In accordance with those arrangements,they are now seeking Arab acquiescence in a continuance of Jewish immigrationbeyond the prescribed quota at the monthly rate at present permissible. they trust that such acquiescence will be readily forthcoming.The arrangements contemplated in order to bridge the interval until a newlong-term policy can be put into effect will in no way prejudice the terms of the trusteeship Agreement, which will supersede the existing Mandate and will therefore control the future policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in their capacity as Trustees for Palestine.ANNEX II.Draft of proposed Note to the, Arab States as recommended by the middle east Conference.His Majesty&apos;s Government will as soon as possible seek the approval of theUnited Nations, in accordance with the terms of the San Francisco Charter, foran Agreement placing Palestine under Trusteeship. Until this can be done,His Majesty&apos;s Government will continue to conform to the existing arrangements as prescribed in the White Paper in respect of Jewish immigration into Palestine.His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that it is desirable, as a temporary measurepending the coming into force of the Trusteeship Agreement, that jewish immigration should continue at the existing rate. His Majesty&apos;s Government feelconfident that the Government of &quot; X &quot; will agree that this is the most expedientway of dealing with the situation during the interim period. This proposal ismade without prejudice to the terms of the Trusteeship Agreement, which willsupersede the existing Mandate and will therefore control the future policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government in their capacity as Trustees for Palestine.
