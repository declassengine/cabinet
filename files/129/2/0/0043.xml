(45) 193.27th September, 1945.CABINET.MAN-POWER REQUIREMENTS FOR AGRICULTURE ANDFISHERIES IN 1946.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.A griculture.THE programme for the production of cereals, sugar-beet and potatoes in1946 approved by the Cabinet at a meeting on the 18th July, 1945 (CM. (45)15th Conclusions, Minute 5), aims at maintaining the total area under crops at about the same level as in 1945, and farmers have been told that specific directionswill be served to ensure that the acreages under potatoes and sugar-beet will bemaintained. At the same time, increases are being sought in livestock to secure agreater output of milk, meat, bacon and eggs.2. This programme will require a labour force in excess of that employedduring the current year, which is already barely adequate. I have grave doubtswhether sufficient labour will be available unless special action is taken.3. The most critical shortage at the moment is of skilled workers. The high level of home food production during the past few years has been achieved with less skilled labour than before the war. Farmers and farm workers have workedexcessive hours; numbers of them remained at work well beyond the normalretiring age.4. With the ending of the war it was to be expected that many of the olderworkers in the industry and others (e.g., local married women) who have workedwhole or part-time as a war measure would wish to retire. The preliminaryagricultural statistics for June 1945 showed that there had been a decline of26,000 in the civilian labour employed in agriculture in England and Walesduring the preceding twelve months. Although these preliminary figures mayexaggerate the decline, there is no doubt that an abnormal wastage of workers from the industry must shortly be expected, if it has not already taken place.Moreover, many of the younger men and women will no longer be prepared towork excessive hours. The effect of this is already being seriously felt on dairyfarms, where workers are increasingly reluctant to put in a seven-day week.It is urgently necessary, if milk production is to be increased or even maintained,to supply additional dairy workers. Additional skilled labour will also be needed to attain the desired increase in sheep, pigs and poultry.5. In addition to extra skilled workers, it will be necessary to have avail-able in the autumn of 1946 a supplementary labour force at least as large as thatavailable in 1945 for handling the corn, potato and sugar-beet harvests.6. At present, the only visible prospect of additional labour for agriculture in the coming year lies in releases from the Forces. Approximately 20,000 to25,000 men released under Class A may return to agriculture by March 1946.Thereafter releases under Class A will proceed very slowly owing to the protection given to agricultural workers under the Schedule of Reserved Occupations in theearly stages of the war. &apos; Releases under Class B are confined to a few&quot; specialists,&quot; and under present arrangements not more than 1,000 workers for agriculture, fisheries and the ancillary industries will be released by the end of theyear.   It is hoped that a number of men and women released from the Forces will[30596]
enter agriculture under the Governments training scheme, though it will be sometime before they can become useful workers, and up to the present the numbershave been disappointingly small.7.   As against this, there are a number of unfavourable factors, e.g. : (i) With the general relaxation of controls it may not be possible to preventthe loss of skilled labour from the land to other industries. Atpresent, workers up to the age of 50 are not allowed to take upemployment outside the industry through the operation of the Controlof Engagement Order.(ii) All members of the Women&apos;s Land Army who joined before the end ofthe war in Europe undertook to serve &quot; for the period of the war,&quot;and it will be necessary after the harvest to release those who wish toreturn to other employment. For some time, the strength of theW.L.A. has been declining, and it is doubtful whether the rate of recruitment can be appreciably increased at this stage. The net lossduring the next twelve months will probably be of the order of 25,000workers, most of whom are, of course, employed on farms, many ofthem as milkers.(iii) It has been agreed to repatriate the Italian prisoners, of whom 60,000are now working in agriculture. There is no assurance that these willbe replaced by Germans owing to the difficulty of bringing additionalGermans from the Continent. Moreover, 30,000 of the Italiansworking in agriculture are now skilled or semi-skilled workers, manyof them looking after live-stock. Even if replacements are availablein the shape of German prisoners it will be some time before they canbecome equally proficient, and in the meantime production will suffer.(iv) For this harvest, extensive help has been available from active personnel of the three Services. By next autumn, demobilisation will have reduced considerably the numbers in this country and less help seems inevitable. This will leave a serious gap in the supply of labour forharvesting.(v) Extensive help has also been received from schoolchildren and othervolunteers for the harvest. For example, about 100,000 adults and50,000 children have attended harvest camps, and many others have worked from their homes. It seems clear that the number of volunteerswho will respond to appeals in 1946 will be much less,(vi) The scope for making further economies in labour by increasedmechanisation will also be reduced by the severe cuts in the import programme for agricultural machinery necessitated by the end ofLease-Lend. The main purpose of such machines as combineharvesters and pick-up balers is to enable one man on the machine todo what by old-fashioned methods required anything from three to six times the number of man hours. In the same way the non-import of crawler tractors, high-powered wheeled tractors, binders and corndrills will mean that machines due to be scrapped will have somehowto be kept going by additional man hours spent on maintenance and repairs.8. Although it is difficult to assess quantitatively the effect of the various factors, it is apparent that, as against a total requirement of more skilled labourand at least as much labour for handling the harvest, under present conditionsthere will actually be less skilled labour and less harvest labour available in 1946than in 1945.Possible action to meet needs of agriculture.9. In the long run agriculture can only retain an adequate labour force if conditions in the industry wages, housing, amenities, &amp;c-are sufficient to attract workers into the industry and encourage existing workers to remain. Inthe immediate future, however, while the abnormal cropping programme neces-sitated by war conditions and the world food shortage has to remain, it will be essential to take exceptional steps to safeguard the &quot;agricultural labour supply.The steps suggested are : (i) In order to increase the supply of skilled workers, immediate approvalshould be given to the block release of at least 10,000 agricultural workers under Class B. There is no other source from which thepresent urgent need for skilled workers can be met.
(ii) Steps should be taken to retain for a further year the control exercisedunder the Control of Engagement Order to prevent agricultural workers from leaving the industry to take other jobs.(iii) There should be no additional call-up of agricultural workers duringthe next twelve months. I should have no objection to continuing to release for the Forces men in the 18-year-old group who are not keyworkers.(iv) Preparations should be made to provide and accommodate at least 50,000additional German prisoners for the 1946 harvest, as well as to replaceany  Italians  who  are withdrawn   for  repatriation.    This  will inevitably entail bringing further prisoners from the Continent,(v) Approval should be given to the billeting of German prisoners as recom-mended by the Minister of Labour in CP. (45) 172.Industries Ancillary to Agriculture.10. Additional labour is also required in a number of industries ancillaryto agriculture for which the main responsibility lies with other Ministers. Itis, however, essential to the maintenance of an adequate level of food productionthat these requirements should be met.  Briefly these needs are as follows :  (i) Rural Building. There is a serious shortage of accommodation in rural districts, and the dilapidated condition of many existing houses isnotorious. Total requirements of new houses are estimated at 300,000in addition to extensive reconditioning of existing cottages. It issuggested that the necessary labour should be made available to meet these needs.(ii) A agricultural Machinery Manufacture. With the restriction on imports and the need to expand exports, more labour must be found for thehome manufacturers whose output is already well below their targets.The main shortages are of foundry labour for the production ofcastings, inability to replace current wastage, losses of former building trade workers, and release of young men to the Forces. It is suggestedthat first preference should be given to the filling of importantvacancies and that withdrawals of labour should be suspended untilsuitable substitutes can be found. In addition ex-foundry workers,willing to return to firms making agricultural machinery, might be released under Class B. At a very rough estimate, the provision of2,000 strong and efficient workers might increase output by as muchas 25 per cent. There is also a need for additional designers,draughtsmen, planning and tool-room staff.(iii) A agricultural Machinery Repair. The repair of existing agricultural machinery is equally vital and the labour position is acute. Moreprotection is needed for machine operators and mechanics classed asmotor mechanics, who are mainly engaged on the repair of tractorsand agricultural machinery.(iv) Fertilisers and Feeding-stuffs. The implementation of the food produc-tion programme depends upon an adequate supply of fertilisers and feeding-stuffs.   The shortages in these industries are Fertilisers (Phosphate Works)     ...       ...       ...   1,200 menFeeding-stuffs (Oilseed crushing and Provendermilling    ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      ...   1,300 menFishing.11. The supply of crews for manning trawlers released from naval service has been giving increasing anxiety for some time. It is estimated that some,700 men will be required in the six months September 1945 to February 1946in order to man the trawlers which will be reconditioned and released by theAdmiralty during that period. To meet these requirements the labour available is not likely to exceed 1,800 men, including men released from the Forces underClass A and new recruits to the industry. There is, therefore, an estimatednumerical deficit of about 900 men. It does not follow, however, that the menbecoming available will include the right proportions of men in the differentcategories, nor that they will all be at the ports where they are required. To allow for these factors, the number of additional men required should be put at not lessthan 1,000.12. Under present arrangements the members of the crews of deep-seavessels are normally made available for naval service on reaching calling-up age,but, in view of the expected difficulties in manning trawlers, the Ministry of
Labour have been asked to suspend calling-up action for the time being. Thiswill not reduce the anticipated deficiency in trawler crews, though it will preventthe deficiency becoming appreciably greater. The only way which promises any reasonable hope of meeting the requirements for manning trawlers appears tobe a special release of fishermen in Class B. I therefore recommend that approvalshould be given to the release of up to 1,000 deep-sea fishermen under the Class Barrangements.13. The production of food, both from the land and the sea, is going to be ofsuch vital importance in 1946, and the position is so gravely threatened by thelabour shortages which I have set out above, that I have felt obliged to draw theattention of my colleagues to the matter.T.
