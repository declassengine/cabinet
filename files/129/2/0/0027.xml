This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentPrinted for the Cabinet, September, 1945SECRETCopy&quot;%o. 76CP. (45) 17720th September, 1945.CABINETTHE FUTURE OF THE MINISTRY OF supply memorandum BY THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY OF .STATEFOR WARThe Ministry of Supply is at present charged with the responsibility for research, design,development and production of warlike stores.The future of the Ministry has been reviewed by the Machinery of government committee, whose conclusions were summarised in a paper, W.P. (44) 713, prepared for theCabinet by Sir John Anderson in December, 1944. This paper put forward two alternative proposals: (a) the Service Department basis, where the Service Departments themselves, both inpeace and war, should be responsible, subject to co-ordination by the Committeeof Imperial Defence, for at any rate the major supplies of the respective fightingServices;(6) the Supply Department basis, where in peace time a single comprehensive supply department would be responsible for procuring all supplies required by the Armyand R.A.F. and certain supplies for the Royal Navy.The War Office is strongly in favour of the first alternative.The service of the user, i.e., the Army in the field, is the ultimate object of all Armyweapon development, research, experiment, design and production. It follows, therefore, inthe War Office opinion, not merely that contact and liaison should be maintained betweenthe Army (i.e., the War Office) and those in charge of these matters, but that the Secretaryof State for War, who is responsible for the efficiency of the Army, should have the design,research, experiment and production of the weapons with which the Army is equipped andfights under his direct control and integrated in the Army machine. This will be all themore necessary in the coming years, when technical and scientific developments of immenseimportance are in prospect and are likely to play an increasing part in the machinery ofdefence. Those developments may indeed shape the whole future of the Army : the Secretaryof State for War should, therefore, be the Minister who answers to Parliament for the lines onwhich they run, and the establishments dealing with these questions should be directly responsible to him. In those establishments there must be a proportion of Army officers with up-to-date military knowledge and high technical ability, who can ensure that the work is carried out with the user&apos;s requirements, actual and prospective, always in view and withthe user&apos;s experience to guide it. These officers must be in close touch and interchangeablewith the rest of the Army, otherwise their military knowledge will soon be out of date.This is unlikely to be so successfully achieved if the establishments are not part of the Army,but are under a separate Ministry to which Army officers are seconded from time to time.So, too, in the Army itself, with its ever increasing reliance on scientific development, it isessential that an increasing number of Army personnel should acquire as high a degree of technical and scientific knowledge and experience as possible. This will only be the case if all ranks of the Army are kept in close touch with scientific developments, and if the trainingof the Army is carried out with a scientific and technical background. If the responsibilityfor development lies with another Minister and if the establishments in which weapondevelopment is carried out are not part of the Army, it may be well that close touch andbackground will be lost. Finally, if only a limited amount of money is in the futureavailable for Army needs, it should be the responsibility of the Secretary of State for war to ensure a proper balance between the manifold requirements of the Army. The efficiency of the Army, for which he is responsible, would depend upon such a balance, whichcannot effectively be observed if a large part of the expenditure devoted to Army require-ments is solely within the discretion of another Department.
(It may be argued that the existing system has been successful in providing the Armywith its needs in war, because the war has been won. But there have in fact beencriticisms-into the merits of which it is unnecessary to enter-that the present system hasnot in fact produced the best results; that stresses and misunderstandings did occur, eventhough they were minimized by the unifying influence of war and a common determination to overcome all difficulties. The Select Committee on National Expenditure in a Most secret memorandum addressed to the late Prime Minister in March, 1944, on Tank Productionrecommended that &quot; the responsibility for obtaining production of technical instruments ofwar such as tanks should rest with the War Office. The transfer of responsibility to the enormous organization of the Ministry of Supply has revealed most serious disadvantages.These disadvantages have not been confined to tanks, but have been evident throughout thewhole field of technical stores &quot;. In this connection it may be worth noting that in theU.S.A., where the control of research, design and production was carried out entirely throughthe U.S. War Department, the results were extremely successful, whereas in Germany, whereproduction was separated from the user, the results were very different.For the reasons outlined above, as well as for the reasons given in Sir John Anderson&apos;s paper, the War Office holds strongly that design, research, experiment and production ofspecial warlike stores should revert to the War Office at an early date. It would, of course,be necessary that there should be co-ordination of Service programmes and planning and allocation of industrial resources on the lines referred to in paragraph 5 (&amp;) of Sir john anderson&apos;s paper.If the decision is that the War Office should have the responsibilities proposed in thepresent memorandum, steps will be taken to ensure that the work within the War office would be in the charge of a first-class man of wide industrial experience, who would be aMember of the Army Council. He would be assisted by the best available scientific advice and by technical officers of the very highest calibre.N. of C.The War Office,20th September, 1945.(B45/67)   no   9/45   W.O.P.   23723
