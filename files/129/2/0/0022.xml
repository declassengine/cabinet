Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET. Copy No. *CP. (45) 172.15th September, 1945.CABINET.THE EMPLOYMENT OF GERMAN AND ITALIAN PRISONERS OFWAR IN GREAT BRITAIN.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.1. I think the time has come when we must review and settle for some timeto come our general policy as regards the employment of Prisoners of War. Iset out in this Paper my views thereon and on a number of subsidiary points onwhich a decision is urgently needed. I summarise my recommendations asfollows : (1) The continued employment of Prisoners should be determined in the lightof the man-power position in the country and be kept under periodicalreview.The employments on which Prisoners of War should be engaged.(2) The Inter-Departmental Committee on the Employment of Prisoners ofWar should be instructed to arrange for the transfer of prisoners from all other employments to employment in one or other of thefollowing categories, the apportionment between the categories being determined by the Committee  (a) agricultural employment (including forestry);(b) employment on building and civil engineering work;(c) employment on the removal of stores from buildings urgently needed for other purposes;(d) employment by the Service Departments on work (includingremoval of defence works) which otherwise would have to bedone by sailors, soldiers or airmen (paragraphs 5-11).(3) The transfers should be made at a steady rate over the next eight months,the aim being to complete the transfers by the end of April 1946(paragraph 11).(4) The Inter-Departmental Committee should report progress periodically,at intervals of not more than two months, to the Ministerial Committeeon Man-Power (paragraph 11).(5) As an experiment, arrangements should be made forthwith to billet asmall number of German Prisoners on farms and the Minister of:Agriculture and Fisheries should be invited to submit, in agreementwith the Standing Inter-Departmental Committee on Security, anearly report on the result of the experiment; appropriate arrange-ments should be made in advance, in consultation with the Ministerof Information, to prepare the public mind for this development(paragraph 13).The Repatriation of Italian Prisoners.(6) If deemed desirable in the interests of our relations with Italy, there patriation of Italian Prisoners should start as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made (paragraph 14).(7) The number of Italian Prisoners to be repatriated this year under any arrangements made under (6) should not exceed 4,000 (paragraph 14).(8) The rate of repatriation subsequently should be the subject of furtherconsideration (paragraph 14).[30522] . B
The employment of additional Germans not now in this country.(9) The present arrangements should be continued under which 225,000- German Prisoners are held on the Continent against our possible future needs; but a number of them may if possible be brought tovacant accommodation here. This question should be further reviewed in six months&apos; time or earlier at the request of the Secretary of Statefor War, if the continued holding of these Prisoners is causing serious difficulties (paragraph 15).The employment of ardent Nazis.(10) The Foreign Office, the War Office and the Ministry of Labour and national Service should jointly examine the possibility of putting the ardent Nazis held in this country to work; these departments should also examine the possibility of putting to work all other german prisoners at present deemed unemployable for whatever reason; andshould submit an early report, with recommendations, through theMinister of Labour and National Service (paragraph 16).(11) The War Office should not, pending further instructions, implementConclusion (2) in W.M. (45) 62nd Conclusions, Minutes 3, relating tothe return to Germany of Prisoners who by reason of their extremeNazi views cannot easily be put to work in the United Kingdom(paragraph 16).2. There are at present available for employment in this country 317,000Prisoners of War and all are, or very shortly will be, in employment. 154,000 ofthem are Italians and 163,000 are Germans. In addition there are 44,000 german prisoners in the country who are not, under current arrangements, regarded asemployable. 14,000 of these are Officers, N.C.O.s and medical personnel who maynot compulsorily be put to work because of the Geneva Conventions; 14,000 arein hospital or permanently unfit; 14,000 are Nazis whom it is deemed inexpedient to employ; and 2,000 are Allied Nationals, who are in process of release to jointheir own National forces.3. There has from the beginning been consultation with the Trade unions on the employment of Prisoners of War, and the arrangements are designed toprevent any depression of the standard of living of British workers : the employerpays the appropriate &quot; rate for the job &quot; (except in agriculture and a few otherindustries where lower rates have been specially agreed through the appropriatenegotiating machinery) and the difference between that rate and the small sumpaid to the Prisoners accrues to the Exchequer, The allocation of Prisoners to departments is made by an Inter-Departmental Committee of which my Depart-ment supplies the Chairman and the Secretariat.4. We began by employing Italian Prisoners of War brought from SouthAfrica and the Middle East, but the number of German prisoners taken in North-West Europe, and the shortages of accommodation in Great Britain made itnecessary during the summer of 1944 to stop bringing Italians to this country andto bring Germans. The employment of the latter was not permitted until 1944,when the War Cabinet agreed&quot; (W.M. (44) 101st Conclusions, Minute 3) to theemployment of 17,000 Germans in escorted groups in agriculture and forestry.On the 30th November, 1944, the War Cabinet agreed to the employment of afurther 20,000 in small unescorted groups in agriculture and forestry (WM. (44)160th Conclusions, Minute 5). The Housing Committee also decided (H. (45) 9thMeeting) that 25,000 German Prisoners of War should be put to work on the advance preparation of housing. Germans generally have proved extremelyuseful workers and on the 18th May, 1945, the War Cabinet recorded thefollowing conclusions (W.M. (45) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 3) :; (1) As many as possible of the German Prisoners now in this country shouldbe put to work, and, with this in view, the existing limitation on thetotal number employed in agriculture and forestry should be removed,and restrictions on the conditions of employment of Prisoners, bothin agriculture and forestry and in other industries, should be suitablyrelaxed. The Inter-Departmental Committee on the Employment ofPrisoners oi War should consider how the available Prisoners shouldbe distributed among the Departments who require their services.
- (2) German Prisoners who by reason of their extreme Nazi views couldnot easily be put to work in the United Kingdom, should, so far aspracticable, be returned to Germany.(3) To replace Prisoners returned to Germany an equivalent number ofnon-Nazi Prisoners should be transferred to the United Kingdom as opportunity arose. In selecting these Prisoners regard should be had to the type of work for which they were needed.(4) The Minister of Labour and National Service and the Secretary of Statefor War should make a further report to the War Cabinet in due course, so that the question of bringing further Prisoners of War tothis country for employment could be reviewed in the light of theprogress made in giving effect to the Conclusions recorded -above.Of these Conclusions (1) has now been carried out. No action has been taken on conclusion (2). Action on Conclusion (3) has been limited to the earmarking of225,000 German Prisoners on the Continent for eventual transfer to this country,if needed. The figure has been fixed at 225,000, but could be increased if deemeddesirable. In addition, 25,000 Germans now held by the United States Armyin this country are to be transferred to us in the coming months.5. In determining future policy in respect of the employment of Prisonersof War in this country, regard must be paid to -(a) our man-power needs;(&amp;) the possibility of an adverse public reaction in this country;(c) policy on reparations;(cZ) foreign policy, with particular reference to policy towards Italy and to possible reactions abroad against our continued use of Prisoner labour.Furthermore, account must be taken of (e) transport difficulties in implementing decisions regarding the repatria-tion of Italian Prisoners or the bringing to this country of furtherGermans;(/) the demands on military man-power for guards and administrativepersonnel;(g) difficulties of accommodation.Subsidiary questions which require examination are (h) the position in regard to employment of Prisoners of War who are ardentNazis;(i) approval of the relaxation of security restrictions on the employment of germans, in particular of the rule which prevents them being billetedon individual farmers.6. In spite of the dislocation and temporary unemployment which may beanticipated as a result of the sudden end of the war with Japan we shall continueto suffer at present from an overall shortage of man-power, especially of heavyunskilled labour. Any immediate loss of Prisoner labour would, therefore,be most unwelcome. If the loss were in any degree substantial, the result mightbe diastrous, especially in agriculture or on housing. It is not possible to say how long this state of affairs will continue, but in examining policy for the immediatefuture, the serious man-power deficiency must, in my view, be the determining factor and policy must be kept under continual review as the man-power situationchanges.7. On the assumption that my colleagues agree with this view and that matters will be so arranged that the number of Prisoners of War available for employment in this country is not for the time being diminished, it is necessary toconsider &apos;(a) the needs, in different industries, for Prisoners;(b) whether, to meet these needs, it will be necessary to bring more Germanshere from the Continent.8. The present distribution of Prisoners between the various User Depart-ments is shown in Annex A. I understand that no User Department is, atpresent, willing to have its allocation reduced. Moreover, at a meeting of theHousing Squad on the 18th July, 1945 (Ff. (45) 16th Meeting) the Minister ofWorks asked that some 200,000 German Prisoners of War might be drafted intobuilding and civil engineering work in the course of the next twelve months. Itwas decided that the Minister of Labour and National Service should bring thisr30522] P 3
question before the Cabinet. These Prisoners would be employed on many different kinds of work as shown&quot; in Annex B. Some 18 per cent, only would beemployed on work directly connected with the Housing Programme,, but their employment on other types of work would free British labour for housing workon which, owing to Trade Union objections, it is not desirable to employ Germans.9. Implementation of the Minister of Works&apos; proposal will only be possible if either-(a) Prisoners in very substantial numbers are taken away from other employments; or,(b) a substantial number of extra Germans is brought here from the Continentover the next twelve months, as the need for them accrues under theMinister of Works&apos; proposal.While not ruling out, for the moment, the possibility of bringing more germans from the Continent, it is necessary first to consider the former alternative, viz.,taking Prisoners in substantial numbers from other employment. In thisconnection the question of the probable public reaction, in particular the reaction of the Trade Union movement, to the continued employment in this country ofPrisoners of War is of prime importance.10. In my view it would be unwise to make plans which involve the con-tinued employment- of Prisoners on work which does not clearly satisfy thefollowing conditions : (a) the work is of first importance and urgency and will patently be of directbenefit to the public at large;(b) the lack of British labour suitable for and wishing to obtain such work is serious and undoubted.The adoption of any other policy would, in my view, lead to trouble at an earlydate as more British man-power becomes available, and would carry with it aserious risk of jeopardising the employment of Prisoners on work of any otherkind.11. If my colleagues agree that our general policy should be as suggestedin the previous paragraph, it is necessary to consider which employments satisfy the conditions there set out. In my view, four employments only satisfy theseconditions, viz. : (a) agricultural employment (including forestry);(b) employment on building and civil engineering work;(c) employment on the removal of stores from buildings urgently needed forother purposes (see L.P. (45) 88, paragraph 18);(d) employment by the Service Departments on work (including removal ofdefence works), which otherwise would have to be done by sailors,soldiers or airmen and thus slow up the rate of release from the armed Forces.The transfer of Prisoners from all other forms of employment to these four will undoubtedly be unwelcome to my colleagues in charge of the Departments whichwould, as a consequence, lose Prisoners. We must, however, look at the man-power situaiton as a whole. The use of Prisoners relieves the general shortageequally whatever employment they are allocated to. Thus, the transfer ofPrisoners to building and civil engineering employment will automatically reducethe demands which would otherwise be made on the British labour market forthat work and the benefit of that reduction will accrue to all other Departmentsincluding those from whom the Prisoners have been taken. I do not deny thatthere will be transitional difficulties and, in certain localities, where British labour is not immediately available in sufficient numbers, difficulties which may be morethan transitional. For this reason I do not suggest that the transfers should bemade all at once and without due regard to special cases. Accommodation diffi-culties would, in any case, prevent this. My recommendation is that the generalpolicy of transferring all prisoners now in this country to employments of thefour kinds set out in this paragraph be approved and that the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee should report to the Ministerial Committee on Man-Power period-cally, at intervals of not more than two months, on the progress made, the aimbeing to make the transfers at a steady rate, and to complete the whole job ineight months, i.e., by the end of April 1946.
12. Whether the implementation of these proposals would require that moreGermans should be brought here from the Continent, over and above any to bebrought, here to replace Italians, cannot at present be determined. This will depend on how the need for Prisoners in the four employments set out at (a)-(d)in paragraph 11 above develops, which in turn will depend, among other things, onthe general man-power situation. The question arises whether we should continueto hold German Prisoners on the Continent against the possible need to transferthem to this country and, if so, how many should be so held. The answer dependsto ia large extent on policy regarding the repatriation of the Italian Prisoners.13. On the 15th June last (CM. (45) 9th Conclusions, Minute 2) the cabinet considered the question of the repatriation of Italian Prisoners of War atpresent in the United Kingdom. It was decided that we should await an approachby the Italian Government and when that approach was made should deal withthe matter through diplomatic channels. The approach was almost immediatelymade, and the matter was further considered by the Cabinet on the 4th July, 1945(CM. (45) 40th Conclusions), when the Foreign Secretary said that, from thepolitical point of view the sooner the Italians were repatriated the better. TheMinister of Agriculture said, however, that he was most anxious to retain some30,000 Italians in the United Kingdom on a wage-earning basis. The cabinet agreed that he should arrange for the Departments concerned to consider how this could be done without the Italians concerned ceasing to be technicallyPrisoners of War. Consideration has been given to this proposal by theDepartments concerned., but it has not been found possible to reach any solutionalong the lines indicated and in my view the proposal should be dropped. Itwas made because the Ministry of Agriculture is much concerned at the possibilityof losing some thousands of skilled Italian farm-workers, especially milkersand stockmen, who have become of great value to the farmers on whom they arebilleted. Many of these would be among the first to go under any equitablerepatriation scheme. These difficulties would, however, be very much reduced if,as and when these billeted Italians are repatriated, they could be replaced byGermans. The Security Executive, having considered the various objections tothe billeting of Germans on farms, recommend that this should now be allowed in small numbers on an experimental basis. I urge that this recommendations should be approved. An early report should be made to the Cabinet regardingthe outcome of the experiment. If it proves successful as I believe it will,especially if proper steps be taken in advance to prepare the public mind forthis development one of the objections to making a start with the repatriation of the Italians will have been removed.14. A major objection, however, remains, viz., that we cannot at presentafford a reduction in our total available man-power resources; more especiallyis this true in regard to men suitable for heavy unskilled labour. Germans,however, work better than Italians and this objection would be more thanremoved if, as Italians return to Italy, Germans could be brought here from theContinent to replace them. It might be that this could only be achieved at theexpense of reducing the transport facilities available for British troops cominghome. If this is so, I do think we can contemplate bringing Germans to thiscountry unless additional shipping can be provided. It follows, therefore, that,for the present, any wholesale repatriation of Italian prisoners would have aserious effect on our man-power position. I would not, however, oppose the intro-duction now of a scheme under which repatriation begins at once provided thatthe numbers to go this year do not exceed 4,000 and that the rate of repatriationthereafter be the subject of further considerations. The loss of even this numberwill be unwelcome, but would not justify my opposition to starting repatriationin a small way if, in the interests of our relations with Italy, my colleaguesconsider this desirable. This would not preclude an announcement to the ItalianGovernment on the lines suggested by the Foreign Secretary in CP. (45) 163. Ihave also in mind that it would be impossible to reconcile the position that wedo not want reparations from Italy in the form of labour with a policy thatdelays the repatriation of Prisoners for whom transport is available. this consideration has reinforced my unwillingness to oppose starting repatriation atonce, subject to the limit, as suggested above, to the numbers to go back this year.Some such limitation would, I understand, be imposed in any case by lack oftransport, and this will readily justify the slowness with which repatriationProceeds in the early months.15. It is now necessary to consider the answer to.the question put at the endjof paragraph 12 above, viz., whether, and if so how many, German prisoners should
continue to be held on the Continent against the possible need to transfer themto this country.   The position is full of uncertainties.   We do not know (a) how quickly transport facilities will enable the repatriation of Italiansto proceed;(b) how soon transport facilities will enable Germans to be brought here;(c) whether, when it is possible for Germans to be brought, the man-power situation will be such that we shall need them, either in replacement of Italians or to increase the overall Prisoner labour force;(d) whether, when the time comes, public opinion would be hostile to theimportation of further German Prisoners.In face of all these uncertainties I rcommend that we continue, as at present, tohold 225,000 German Prisoners on the Continent against our possible futureneeds, but if as may well prove to be the case, it is possible to bring a number ofthem to vacant accommodation in existing camps, this may be done. Thequestion should be reconsidered in six months, or earlier if the holding of these prisoners is causing serious difficulties to the Control Commission for Germany.These 225,000 Germans, if later they were all brought over, added to the 25,000to be transferred to us by the United States Army Authorities, would make, withthe 163,000 &quot;employable&quot; Germans already here, a total of something over400,000 German Prisoners. I do not think we should contemplate a Prisoner ofWar labour force larger than this, and for this reason have not recommended any increase in the number of German Prisoners held, on our account, on theContinent. I have in mind the possibility of adverse reactions abroad, especiallyin the United States, to the employment of Prisoner of War on any other than a strictly temporary basis. The telegram from Moscow to the Foreign Office,reproduced as Annex C is interesting in this connection. Any hostility whichmight develop would find a ready focus in the meetings of the InternationalLabour Organisation.   Our whole policy must be framed with this in mind.16. It is necessary to consider what our policy should be towards the ardentNazis and other &quot;unemployable&quot; Germans now held in this country. TheConclusion of the War Cabinet recorded at (2) in paragraph 3 above has not yetbeen implemented. It is out of harmony with the instructions given to the UnitedKingdom delegation to the Moscow Conference, viz. : &quot; Reparation labour need not be taken solely .... from among activeNazis.&quot;   (See R.M. (45), 6, paragraph 12 (6)).Implementation of the policy to return all ardent Nazis would, in my view, havethe very unfortunate result of seeming to reward these men. It would, moreover,add to the difficulties facing the Control Commission for Germany. I believe thatit should be possible to employ the great majority (if not all) of the ardent Nazisnow here, numbering some 20,000, in gangs under adequate guards. I recom-mend that this question be remitted for further examination by the Foreign Officeand the War Office in consultation with my Department with a view to the sub-mission of an early report. At the same time, the difficulties in the way of employing the other German Prisoners, numbering some 33,000, at present held to be unemployable, should be further explored and reported on. Meanwhile, theWar Office should be instructed not to implement the decision that the ardentNazis should, so far as practicable, be returned to Germany.G.

ANNEX C.(Special (Reparations).Telegram from Moscow to Foreign Office, 16th July, 1945.[Mr. Roberts. No. 80 Victim.]Repeated to Washington.Paris (please repeat as my telegram No. 63).Leggett has discussed reparation labour with the Americans whose views areas follows  (1) While they do not propose to employ such labour in America, they are greatly disturbed by the prospect of serious objection being taken in America tothe employment of Germans as forced labour. They anticipate political repercussions on this subject.(2) They recognise, however, that this has to be faced, and that even in GreatBritain there will be need, although, as they hope, for only a short period, for additional labour pending full demobilisation of the Forces. Their minimumconditions, however, are that (a) such employment should be regarded as a reparation as opposed to a penalmatter and they insist that there should be no suggestion of punish-ment as a reason for such employment. This would not preclude theinclusion of classes such as S.S. members or other individuals.(6) reparation labour shall be employed only on restitution, repairreconstruction, &amp;o, to restore damage and not on normal productivework. Apparently they would not exclude employment in agriculturewhile, owing to war needs, other labour cannot be made available.(c) they would require the adoption of a scheme which would place Germanlabour in a not less favourable position in regard to remuneration thanthat of German civilian labour employed in Germany. On this, theyare attracted by our plan to cause the German authorities to creditreparation labour with any difference between the amount received in cash and kind by German reparation labourers and their families andthe amount of German civilian wages.(d) there should be no impressment of German labour after a reasonablyshort interval.(e) only male labour shall be employed.(3) From the above it will be seen that there is practical agreement between us and the Americans. We have similar domestic criticism in prospect. they wish with us to have a declaration on conditions and they would even supportan international supervising authority. They agreed, however, that there couldbe no question of accepting responsibility of enforcing conditions in any country.Please repeat to Solicitor-General at &quot; Terminal.&quot;(Repeated Paris,.
