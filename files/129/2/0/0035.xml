Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET.Copy No.CP. (45) 185.20th September, 1945.CABINET.PRODUCTION  AND   DISTRIBUTION   OF  BUILDING  materials and COMPONENTS.Note by the Prime Minister.MY note of the 20th September (CP. (45) 184) sets out the arrangementsfor the discharge of Ministerial responsibilities with regard to housing. I havealso considered the question of the allocation of responsibility for the productionof building materials and components and have agreed with the ministers concerned on the arrangements described in the following paragraphs of this note.2. Responsibility for all the main materials and components required for building will in future be shared between the Ministers of Works and Supply,and the Board of Trade will transfer to the Ministry of Supply their functions as production authority for those components for which they have hitherto been responsible. A few materials used&apos; in building will continue to be theresponsibility of other Departments Ministry of War Transport, Ministry of fuel and Power and Ministry of Food -but this need not lead to&apos; any compiica-tions or difficulty.3. The Government must ensure that building materials and componentsare produced in sufficient quantities and in due time to meet the requirements ofthe building programme; and it will be the function of the Ministries of works and Supply, as production authorities, to see that this is done.4. In the first place the Ministry of Works, in consultation with the otherDepartments concerned through the Building Materials Co-ordinating Committee,will make an estimate of the quantities of materials and components of every kind needed for the execution of the total building programme for Great britain as a whole. This estimate must be based partly on the proposed rate of expansionof the building industry and partly on the nature of the building work on which[30552]
the industry is to be employed. The Ministry of Works have formulated the plans for the expansion of the building industry and it is also their responsibility to formulate, in consultation with the other Departments concerned, the building programme as a whole, including not only new house construction but also new construction other than housing, as well as maintenance and the repair of war damage.5. When the Ministry of Works have framed an estimate, of the totaldemands for each of the materials and components required, responsibility for ensuring the production of the required quantities will be assumed by theproduction authorities.* The Ministry of Works and the Ministry of Supply,each m their own field, will first consider whether there is sufficient capacity, &amp;o,in the industries concerned to produce the quantities required at the clue times.When sufficient production will not be forthcoming, substitutes will have to beconsidered. In the case of components for which the Ministry of Supply is theproduction authority, the use of substitutes will be discussed with the Ministryof Works. Where the housing programme is affected by a proposed use of substitutes, whether in the field of the Ministry of Works or in that of theMinistry of Supply, the proposal will be discussed with the Health Departmentsby the Ministry of Works.6. If there is sufficient capacity in the industry to produce the quantitiesrequired, the production authority will consider whether any special steps arenecessary to ensure that these quantities are produced in due time and at areasonable price. In some cases no special steps may be needed. In others it willbe necessary to enter into production agreements or to place bulk orders.7. Price control arrangements will be the responsibility of the productionauthority in each case, but the Building Materials Co-ordinating Committeeshould be used as a central point for ensuring a common policy in this matter.8. With regard to production agreements and bulk orders, the Ministriesof Works and Supply are likely to find that, while they must take account of theproduction required to meet the total needs of the building programme as a whole,they need guarantee production only of the quantities needed for the housing programme.9. The production authority will be responsible for the decision whetherand if so how far, it is necessary to have recourse to production agreements orbulk purchase in order to ensure production of the quantities of each of the materials and components for which it is responsible. If the production authorityconsiders it necessary to make a production agreement or to purchase in bulk, itwill obtain the concurrence of the Ministry of Works and act as the agent ofthat Department.* In the remainder of this note it is assumed that no difficulty will arise over the productionof the materials for which the Ministries of War Transport, Fuel and Power and Food areresponsible as production authorities. If any such difficulty should arise, it would be handled by the same means as is proposed in this note for components for which responsibility rests withthe Ministry of Supply.
10. The capital necessary to meet any financial liability resulting from a production agreement, and the payments to manufacturers and the cost of storage and distribution arising in connection with bulk orders will be provided byadvances from the Consolidated Fund which will be paid into a building materials and Housing Fund under the control of the Minister of Works. all expenditure and receipts in connection with production agreements and bulkorders, as well as in connection with the production of prefabricated houses andthe preparation of sites and the erection of houses (prefabricated or other) onbehalf of local authorities, will be charged and credited respectively to thisFund.11. The Ministry of Works will be responsible for questions connected withthe distribution of building materials and components. In particular, theMinistry of Supply will look to the Ministry of Works for any necessarydirections as to the consignment from manufacturers&apos; works of components madeunder production agreements entered into, or bulk orders placed by, the Ministryof Supply. If, in connection with production agreements or bulk orders, steps have to&apos; be taken to ensure that the output of the various manufacturers ismatched by demands from users, the Health Departments will be responsible for making any necessary arrangements with, and through, local authorities in sofar as materials and components for the housing programme are concerned.C. E. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,20th September, 1945.
