(45) 188.22nd September, 1945.CABINET.Copy No.DEMOBILISATION.Note by the Secretary.BY direction of the Prime Minister I circulate herewith a letter he hasreceived from the Secretary of State for War.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd September, 1945.ANNEX.General Headquarters, Middle East Force,Dear Prime Minister, 13th September, 1945.On my way to the Far East I spent this morning in Cairo and addressed a large meeting of &quot;other Ranks.&quot; I was alone in the meeting. Manyquestions came up, but easily the one that concerns the soldier most is that of standing by the principle of &quot;Age and Service.&quot; The scheme has the full support of every man. But they are very apprehensive of any change in view ofthe criticism at home. There was a spontaneous and prolonged storm of cheeringwhen I repeated the Governments decision to stand by the scheme.I am convinced from this experience that any modification of the schemewhich meant that men at home or anywhere else got released before their turnwould have results which would be worse for the Government than any criticism at present. The men here understand that transport is the key to thesituation. While the men want to get home they are in good heart and moraleis good. I think you ought to know this in view of the pressure upon theGovernment in respect to the scheme for release.Yours sincerely,(Signed) J. J. LAWSON.
