Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1945.SECRET. Copy No.     ilCP. (45) 166.10th September, 1945.CABINET.RELAXATION OF RESTRICTIONS ON DEPARTURE OF BRITISHSUBJECTS AND ALIENS FOR OVERSEAS DESTINATIONS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.IN peace time neither British subjects nor aliens required permission toleave the United Kingdom. During the war restrictions have been imposed under emergency Powers (Defence Regulation 18) for purposes of security, man-powerand currency control. Now that hostilities have ceased it is necessary to review atonce the retention of these powers and their continued use to restrict the departureboth of British subjects and of aliens from this country.2. At their meeting on the 24th July (CM. (45) 17th Meeting, Minute 1)the late Cabinet approved in principle proposals whereby the existing require-ment of an exit permit for each journey would be abolished, and, instead, reliancewould be placed on the endorsement of British passports as valid for specifieddestinations, as a signal to the Immigration Staff at the ports that departurefor any of those destinations on any number of occasions was duly authorised.Applications by persons in the call-up age group (18 to 30) were to be submittedto the Ministry of Labour and National Service before passports were issued;and for travel to neutral countries in Europe and to India, Burma and a fewColonies, a security check was to be required.3. Now that Japan has surrendered, there is no need to maintain a securitycheck in the interests of Allied operations; and I suggest that it is unsatisfactoryto attempt to control entry into other parts of the Empire or to Protectoratesor Mandated Territory, by checks on departure from this country. The traditional&quot; British Empire &quot; endorsement on a British passport has for long been subjectto a warning that it does not enable the holder to travel to Palestine, Transjordanor the Aden Protectorate; and it is well known that permission is required,for instance, from the Canadian authorities to enter Canada. Even if passportsissued here were not endorsed as valid for certain Empire destinations, exceptafter security check, there is no guarantee that a corresponding check will be imposed by the self-governing Dominions before a &quot;British Empire&quot; endorse-ment is placed on passports issued by them. After inter-departmental discussion it has now been agreed that British passports should ordinarily be issued withthe traditional British Empire endorsement, and the attention of travellers drawnby an enclosure in the passport to the need for obtaining a visa, entry permit,or military permit, for those parts of the Empire where admission still needs to be specially controlled. All possible publicity by other methods also should begiven to these requirements. Any security check necessary will be applied atthe stage of application for visa, entry or military permit. I submit, therefore,that the proposal to link the issue of a passport and the validity given to it withthe question of entry into the country of destination should be reconsidered, andthe scheme outlined above adopted. Special arrangements are being worked out to &quot;vet&quot; would-be passengers to India from the security standpoint,although there are at present no powers to refuse leave to land in India to aBritish subject whose passport is in order for the journey to India.4. If the scrutiny of passport applications by reference to the applicant&apos;sdestination can be eliminated, a check will be necessary only where the applicantJs within the call-up age group.   Here, too, the situation has been changed by[30500]
the surrender of Japan, and I understand that the future policy in relation toman-power requirements for the armed forces and for other forms of nationalservice is under consideration. It is arguable that it is no longer appropriate tocontrol possible attempts to evade such service by preventing embarkation, butthat it should be sufficient to rely on the deterrent effect of penalties to whichthe absentee would be liable on his return. This will require consideration whenpermanent legislation for regulating national service is introduced; but in themeantime I am anxious that as an interim measure the scheme whereby possessionof a passport would be sufficient to obtain leave to embark, and British passportswould be issued subject only to check for man-power reasons, shall be introducedwithout delay. If possible, an announcement should be made about the1st October. ........5. The Cabinet Conclusions of the 24th July contained a reservation that no public announcement of the proposed change should be made until the principles on which the Priority Passage Board would operate had been considered inter-departmentally, and agreement had been reached regarding the terms on whichthe dependants of members of the Forces and the Civil Service serving overseaswould be afforded travel facilities. The latter question has been dealt with byan inter-departmental meeting at the Treasury; and it is understood that theService Departments are now prepared to announce new regulations regardingentitlement to -assisted passages. The principles on which the Passage PriorityBoard will work have also been discussed, and, pending its formal constitution,the existing allocation machinery of the Ministry of War Transport will continueto deal with applications. The way is therefore open to introduce the new system,which appears the only remedy for the very serious congestion of work and delays(which in effect amount to a denial of permission to travel at all) caused by theever-increasing volume of applications for exit permits and travel documents inthe Passport and Permit Office. No additional man-power can be obtained to relieve the strain; there is serious danger of a breakdown, and there have been several attacks in the Press on what is an indefensible situation.6. The proposed announcement of the simplified procedure should be accompanied by a warning in the strongest terms that no additional transport forlong sea voyages is likely to be available. Limited public services by sea to holland and Belgium, in addition to the existing service to France, are likely to be opened in the near future, but the number of persons travelling to the Continent will befurther limited by the necessity for obtaining visas to enter these countries. Thenumber and duration of an individuals journeys will also be restricted by the ration of exchange that can be allowed him (on which the Chancellor of theExchequer has presented a paper (L.P. (45) 164) to the Lord President^Committee.7. As regards aliens, I propose that the existing restrictions on departureshould now be abandoned. It has been agreed by the Security Service and theMinistry of Labour and National Service that there is now no reason to retainthem in the interests of security or man-power.8. Stop Lists reduced to the narrowest limits will still be maintained toprevent the issue of passports to a very small number of British subjects, or the departure of the very few aliens, who for security reasons ought not at present toleave.9, As pointed out in my predecessor&apos;s memorandum (OP. (45) 87), the issueof passports is a function of the Foreign Secretary; but it would seem appropriate that decisions to refuse travel documents (whether passports or travel permitcards for use in the British Isles), or leave to embark on security grounds shouldcontinue to be the responsibility of the Home Secretary, and that refusals of pass-ports on man-power grounds should be defended by the Minister of Labour and national Service.J. C. E.Home Office, S.W. 1,10th September, 1945.
