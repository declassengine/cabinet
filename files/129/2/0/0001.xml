THIS DOCUMENT XS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 151.6th September, 1945.CABINET.REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ELECTIONS.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.THE Report from the Select Committee on Elections has now been published.I attach a copy to this paper. My colleagues will recall that this Committee wasappointed to consider whether the elections of Mrs. Jean Mann and Mr. John C.Forman, Labour Members for the County of Lanark (Coatbridge Division) andthe Burgh of Glasgow (Springburn Division), respectively, were invalid on theground that at the time of their election they were members of a Tribunal con-stituted under the Rent of Furnished Houses Control (Scotland) Act, 1943, and hence holders of offices of Profit within the meaning of the Law relating to offices of Profit.2. The Committee reached the conclusion that the elections of these two members were invalid and made the following recommendations : (1) A Statute should be enacted to relieve Mrs. Mann and Mr. Forman fromthe pecuniary penalties which they had incurred and to validate theirelections.(2) The whole question of Offices of Profit should be examined with a viewto avoiding hardship J* this and similar cases which might arise frominadvertence and not from any desire to take advantage of theambiguity of existing law.I have sought the opinion of the Law Officers on these recommendations, andI attach in an annex the opinion given by the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General for England and Wales. The Lord Advocate, who has been consulted,concurs in the conclusion reached by the English Law Officers.3: I agree with the Law Officers&apos; view that the elections should be validated.The Labour majority at Coatbridge was 6,777 in a straight fight with a Conserva-tive on a total poll of 30,461, whilst at Springburn it was 10,008 in a straightfight with a Conservative on a total poll of 33,388. It is not probable that the holding of further elections at these two places would lead to any different result,and thereby justify the further trouble and expense which would be involved. Atthe same time I think that this is a serious step and we should consider whetherthe preamble to the Bill validating the elections ought to stress the exceptionalnature of these two cases which should not be regarded as weakening the prin-ciple that irregular elections must not be validated by statute. 1 ought also topoint out to my colleagues that the decision of. the Committee to recommendvalidation was not unanimous but was taken by a vote of five to one two membersbeing absent. The member in the minority was Sir Charles MacAndrew (Con-servative) and the two absent members were Sir Arnold Gridley (Conservative)and Mr. Sydney Silverman (Labour).4.   If a decision is taken to pass a special Statute an announcement to this effect should be made as soon as possible after the House meets.5. I do not think that in the present state of the legislative programme wecan consider the passage of legislation to meet the. second of the SelectCommittee&apos;s recommendations.[30467]
6.   I recommend that (a) The Law Officers should be authorised to proceed at once with thepreparation of the necessary Bill, and that they should considerthe possibility of drafting a preamble to the Bill stressing the impor-tance of the underlying principle which*% these two cases is beingwaived for special reasons, namely, that irregular elections should notbe validated by legislation.(b) I should be authorised to make a statement to the House explaining whatthe Government propose to do in the case of these two elections andthe reason for their action.I have consulted the Secretary of State for Scotland who is in agreementwith these recommendations.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S. W. 1,6th September, 1945.- ANNEX.Law Officers&apos; Opinion.Select Committee on Elections.THERE is little that we can usefully say on the recommendation of the SelectCommittee of the House of Commons that legislation should be introducedvalidating the election of Mrs. Mann and Mr. Forman, whose position wasenquired into.There is no legal difficulty in the proposed legislation, but although therehave been oases in which Members validly elected have been relieved of theconsequences of some disqualification from membership which subsequently arose,there has, as the Select Committee points out, never previously been a case in.which the election of a person disqualified at the time of election has beenvalidated. Nor did the Select Committee which reported in 1941 on the general position in regard to offices or places of profit under the Crown recommend thatsuch offices as those concerned in the present oases should cease to disqualify from membership. It is important to maintain the general principle, and to validatean election invalid in itself may seem a rather more drastic interference with theoperation of the existing law than to relieve a validly elected Member of somedisqualification inadvertently incurred during the ,course of his membership.It is possibly easier for existing Members to be led into the inadvertent acceptanceof disqualifying offices, since they may not unnaturally assume that the Crownwill only offer to appoint them to offices which they may accept without disquali-fication.th.an for candidates already holding office^and who might not unreasonablybe expected to ascertain whether or not they were qualified for election before putting themselves forward.Despite these considerations, however, we agree that the sensible course inthe circumstances of the present cases is to validate the elections since, in viewof the majorities both Members secured, it is difficult to imagine that the holding of fresh elections would lead to any different result.The Select Committee&apos;s recommendation that the law in regard to place-holding should be clarified is, of course, not new. The whole position wasexhaustively examined by the Select Committee in 1941, which made various recommendations for legislation. The law is in many respects in an obscure and unsatisfactory condition, and if parliamentary time can be found it would nodoubt be desirable to introduce legislation on the lines indicated by the SelectCommittee.H.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ELECTIONSREPORTThe Select Committee appointed to consider whether the elections of Mrs.Jean Mann and Mr. John C. Forman, as Members of this House for theCounty of Lanark (Coatbridge Division) and the Burgh of Glasgow (Spring-burn Division), respectively, are invalid on the ground that they at thetime of their election were members of a Tribunal constituted under the rent of Furnished Houses Control (Scotland) Act, 1943: HAVE agreed tothe following REPORT:  Preliminary1. Your Committee have held two sittings, and have examined Sir GilbertCampion, K.C.B., the Clerk of the House of Commons and Sir MarshallMillar Craig, C.B., K.C., Legal Secretary, Lord Advocate&apos;s Department.The two Members of the House whose position is affected by the inquiry,Mrs. Jean Mann and Mr. John C. Forman, also gave evidence.The Law relating to Offices of Profit2. Section 24 of the Succession to the Crown Act, 1707, which is thebasis of the voluminous statute law on the acceptance and holding of officesby Members of the House of Commons, provides that,&quot; No person, who shall have in his own name or in the name of anyperson in trust for him or for his benefit any new office or place of profitwhatsoever under the Crown which at any time since the 25th&apos; October,1705, have been created or erected, or hereafter shall be created or erected. . . shall be capable of being elected, or of sitting or voting as a memberof the House of Commons. ...&quot;In the case of the Rent of Furnished Houses Control (Scotland) Act,1943, it is enacted that,&quot; The members and acting members of the Tribunal (constituted underthe Act) shall receive such remuneration and such travelling and other allowances as the Secretary of State may, with the consent of the Treasury,determine.&quot;Your Committee were of opinion that this provision in the Act of 1943may be construed as bringing the two Members of Parliament, Mrs. Mannand Mr. Forman, who were members of such a Tribunal at the time oftheir election, within the scope of Section 24 of the Succession to the CrownAct, 1707, and may make them liable to the  500 penalty prescribed bySection 28 of that Act, for sitting or voting as Members. The fact that both Members have taken the Oath might be accepted as proof of sitting,though neither of them has voted.3. Mrs. Mann and Mr. Forman, in their evidence, both showed that thesmall remuneration which they had received on the rare occasions thatthe Tribunal had met, was, when set against expenses, a negligible amount,j and that their work on the Tribunal was undertaken as a public duty&apos; and not for profit.4. But a series of precedents was submitted to Your Committee in supportof the view that the receipt of remuneration by the holder of office is irnma-terial, provided that his office is one in respect of which remuneration isI payable, and this is so even when the remuneration is now fictional, as44808 A 2
in the case of the Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds. The only contra-dictory precedent is that afforded by Pringle&apos;s case in 1924, where a selectcommittee reported that Mr. Pringle&apos;s election was valid because, though:holding an office remunerated by fees, he had not received any fees since his election, and had announced his intention in future of performing his dutieswithout fees.   (H.C. 131 (1924-5).)5. The principle underlying the conception of the disqualification of office-holders was the fear that the independence of a member of the commons might be affected by his dependence on the Crown. To-day this principle is still of great importance, in order to ensure that the House ofCommons is a body acting without dependence on the executive or thegovernment, and it is easy to see that if the rule were abrogated the Housemight be filled with a very large number of persons holding governmentposts and owing a duty to the executive, to such an extent that their inde-pendence might be compromised. The Select Committee on Offices orPlaces of Profit under the Crown, which considered the whole question at length in 1941, recommended the repeal of that part of the succession to the Crown Act, 1707, which provided for penalties obtainable by a commoninformer and the introduction of simpler machinery to decide cases of doubt,but reaffirmed the importance of the principle underlying the prohibition of office-holding by Members (H.C. 120 (1940-41)).Conclusion.6. Your Committee&apos;s conclusion on the question submitted to&apos; them, basedon the statute law and supported by many precedents of the House, is thatthe elections of Mrs. Jean Mann and Mr. John Forman are invalid, becauseat the time they held offices of profit under the Crown within the meaning of section 24 of the Succession to -the Crown Act, 1707.The question of legislation consequent on the Committee&apos;s conchision.7. Your Committee are satisfied that the disqualification was incurred byMrs. Mann and Mr. Forman by inadvertence and that they acted in good faith, and Your Committee recommend that legislation should be introduced to relieve the two Members from the pecuniary penalties prescribed by sec-tion 28 of the Act of 1707.8. When a sitting Member has accepted and held an office of profit which is incompatible with sitting in the House of Commons, the usual course is forthe Member to vacate his seat and for the House to order a new writ for aby-election, followed by the passing of an Act of Indemnity to protect himagainst the recovery of penalties under the Act of 1707 at the instance of acommon informer.9. Two recent precedents however the Under-Secretaries of State Act,1929, and the Arthur Jenkins Indemnity Act, 1941 show that Acts ofIndemnity have also permitted sitting Members, who&apos; inadvertently tookdisqualifying office, to retain their seats. But there is no precedent for a statute validating the election to* Parliament of a candidate who was dis-qualified by holding an office of profit at the time of his election.10. In considering whether they might recommend that the necessary Bill ofIndemnity should indemnify the two Members to the extent of validatingtheir election, as well as freeing them from penalties, Your Committee wereinfluenced by the following facts: (i) In this case the electors recorded their votes a few weeks ago, after an unusually long election, and the vacation of the two seats now would
! mean a repetition of the whole electoral process, disturbing to the constitu-ency and costly to the candidates of all parties, and with possibly the same result.(ii) Although it is clearly the duty of candidates for election to Parlia-ment -to ensure that no disabilities attach to them, the two Members haveconvinced Your Committee that their service on the Tribunal was under-taken purely from public spirit and not in any way for profit.   In factIthey may have been out of pocket as a result of their work, and in thesecircumstances both Members were unaware that service on the tribunal would constitute a legal disability for election.ii. Your Committee were anxious not to impose an unnecessary burdenI either on the electorate or on the two Members, whose disqualification is dueI to a technicality of the law rather than to any deliberate omission on their part, and notwithstanding the importance to the House of Commons of thej principle underlying the prohibition of office-holding, as well as the existenceI of precedents against the validation of elections in such cases, Your CommitteeI recommend in this case that a statute validating the election of Mrs. Mannland Mr. Forman be enacted.I 12. Your Committee are strongly of the opinion that the whole questionI should be examined with a view to avoidance of hardship in this and similarcases which may arise from inadvertence, and not from any desire to takeadvantage of the ambiguity of existing law. The Report of the Select Com-mittee on Offices or Places of Profit under the Crown, 1941, contains many important recommendations, and these recommendations should be adopted at the earliest opportunity. For convenience, a summary of the saidrecommendations is set out in an Appendix to the Minutes of Evidence.23rd August, 1945..ct,of)okr alis-1 ofingferefter,uldPROCEEDINGS OF THE COMMITTEE.WEDNESDAY, 22nd AUGUST, 1945.Mr. Clement Davies.Sir Ralph Glyn.Mr. Grenfell.Dr. Haden Guest.Members present:Mr. Hector Hughes.Sir Charles MacAndrew.Mr. Sydney Silverman.Mr. Webb.!
