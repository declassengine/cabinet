Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1945.SECRET.       v Copy No.CP. (45) 163.10th September, 1945.CABINET.ITALIAN PRISONERS OF WAR,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.SINCE this subject was considered by the late Cabinet on the 12th July,the importance of reaching an early decision in regard to the repatriation of italian prisoners of war in this country has considerably increased.2. Whereas before that date only the United States Government had decidedto repatriate prisoners held by them, the Soviet Government have recently announced that those in the U.S.S.R. are to be &quot; liberated &quot; and repatriated as quickly as the available transport permits. General de Gaulle also informedSignor Nenni during the latter&apos;s recent visit to Paris that Italian prisoners ofwar in France and North Africa were in principle to be repatriated, though there might be some delay on account of transport difficulties. Further, it isnow widely known that German prisoners are being released to their homes.Finally, Count Carandini has made pressing representations to me about thedeclining morale of the prisoners in this country.3. In these circumstances I feel that our own position is somewhatanomalous and that to maintain it may work to the advantage of our detractorsin Italy and seriously prejudice our relations with Italy. I am very anxiousto see sent furthermore home some Carabinieri, if there are any available, toimprove the standard of the Italian police, and I do not think it would be right,to single out these prisoners for repatriation in advance of the rest, though theycould quite properly be included with others in the first batches.4. Clearly there can be no repatriation from this country before the harvestis safely gathered; and our demobilisation and redeployment schemes will havea prior claim on shipping for some time to come. Nevertheless, I should like toinform the Italian Government that we agree in principle that repatriation may-begin in the near future.5. I would therefore propose, if my colleagues agreed, to make the followingcommunication to the Italian representative in the name of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment : &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have decided inprinciple that as soon as this year&apos;s harvest is completed and as soon astransport is available, Italian prisoners of war in this country shall be repatriated to Italy. Recent developments have made the shipping positioneven more difficult than hitherto and it is therefore impossible to fix any definite date for the beginning of this repatriation. Nevertheless every effort will be made to ensure that repatriation is started before the end of thisyear. Pending repatriation the existing arrangements will remain in forceexcept in so far as may be mutually agreed in the meantime between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Italian Government,&quot;In making this communication to Count Carandini I would inform him thathe wras free to convey it to the prisoners in such manner as might be agreed between himself and the Departments concerned.6. It would be desirable that the Dominion Governments should be informedbefore any public announcement is authorised.E. B.Foreign Of/ice, 10th September, 1945.12914   [30495]
