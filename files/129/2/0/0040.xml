This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentPrinted for the Cabinet, September, 1945SECRETCopy No.&quot;CP. (45) 1902,6th September, 1945.CABINETEMPLOYMENT OF MEMBERS AND EX-MEMBERS OF police forces ON POLICE WORK ABROADMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARIES OF STATE FOR WAR ANDFOREIGN affairs. It is necessary to establish police forces, consisting mainly of members and ex-members of civil police forces, for the policing of the British zones of occupation inGermany and Austria and the control of, and supervision of the reconstruction of,the German and Austrian police forces.2. For Germany alone, at least 800 persons will be required, and it is vital torecruiting that suitable persons now serving in the Armed Forces should be persuaded to enrol in the new force before they return home for demobilization.3. It has become clear that a sufficient number of recruits will not be obtained forthis important work unless pledges are given safeguarding their police pension rights and ensuring their return to their parent police forces when their service abroad is completed.4. Such pledges would require legislation. We, therefore, propose that a Bill shouldbe introduced at the earliest possible date, which would:  (a) authorize the seconding of members of police forces in England and scotland for police work outside Great Britain and make provision for their return totheir forces at the end of the period of secondment;(b) authorize a Secretary of State, with the approval of the Treasury, to make regulations applying, with any necessary modifications, the relevant provisions of the Police Pensions Act, 1921, to persons employed abroad onsuch police work;(c) authorize the payment out of the Exchequer of pensions and contributions towards pensions in respect of such service and to provide for the incidence of cost as between the Exchequer and the former and future employers ofthese persons;(d) authorize a Secretary of State to make regulations as to the discipline of the personnel which would enable him to set up a code of offences and punish-ments similar to those contained in the normal police regulations and toapply, with any necessary modifications, the provisions of the Police(Appeals) Acts;(e) provide that a person who, being in the United Kingdom (e.g., on leave),refused to return to duty abroad would be liable, on conviction, to penaltiessimilar to those provided by Defence Regulation 92(1), i.e., on summary conviction, a maximum of 3 months imprisonment and/or ^100 fine, and onindictment to a maximum of 2 years imprisonment and /or a  500 fine.The regulations proposed could, if thought desirable, be made subject to a negative resolution of both Houses.5. The object of our proposals is to secure that the conditions of service and discipline of police officers seconded for service in these forces will generally be thesame as when they are serving in this country. The rates of pay will, in fact, be higher.The formation and pay of the new forces require no statutory authority.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is a party to these proposals since his department is responsible for administering the British Police Mission to Greece. in recruiting the Greek Mission no undertaking was given as regards reinstatement and this
question was left for settlement between the individual officers and their home police forces. Nor should it be necessary to apply to the Greek Mission the disciplinaryregulations which will be required for the German and Austrian Commissions. It isessential, however, that power should be taken to provide pensions and compensationfor officers of the Greek Mission on the lines suggested in paragraphs 4 (6) and (c) above.With the consent of the Treasury, officers in the Greek Mission were informed at thetime of their recruitment that pension and compensation arrangements would be made which would be no less favourable to them than those which apply to police officersunder the Police Pensions Acts of 1921 and 1926.7. A proposal to carry on for a time by means of a Defence Regulation has beenexplored, but rejected because of legal difficulties. Even if a Defence Regulation could have been used as a temporary expedient, a Bill would still have been necessary atsome stage to provide for the payment of pensions (in respect of service in the newforces), after the Defence Regulation had expired.8. We, therefore, seek authority (a) to submit a Bill to the Legislation Committeeon the lines indicated above with a view to its very early introduction, and (&amp;) to informprospective recruits that it is proposed to introduce legislation which will safeguard their pension rights and, in the case of serving members of English and Scottish police forces,ensure their return to duty with their parent forces at the end of their periods of second-ment, unless their conduct during secondment has rendered them unfit for furtheremployment with the police.The Treasury, Home Office and Scottish Office concur in our proposals and willcollaborate in the drafting of the Bill, which should be non-controversial.J- J- L.E.
