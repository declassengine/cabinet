(45) 171.14th September, 1945.CABINET.SITE OP THE UNITED NATIONS ORGANISATION.(Memorandum by the Minister of State.)THE question of the site of the United Nations is among those on whichthe Executive Committee of the Preparatory Commission now in session inLondon, is instructed to prepare recommendations, and it is therefore important that an early decision of policy should be taken.2, The Coalition Government, after consideration of this question, recom-mended at the British Commonwealth meeting in April 1945 -(i) That the site should be in Europe;. (ii) That it should not be in the territory of a Great Power;(iii) That the best place in Europe would be Geneva.3. There was a fair measure of agreement at the meeting that if possiblewe should return to Geneva, and subsequent investigation has shown how difficultit would be to secure agreement to any other European site.4. The reasons in favour of Europe are, in my opinion, overwhelming.It is the most populous of the continents except Asia; its problems are, andwill be, vitakto the peace of the world; it is more accessible to the majority of states than any other continent; and, it is the home of English and French,which will probably be the two working languages of the Organisation.5. The arguments against the territory of a Great Power (even if the sitebe internationalised) are that it confers undue opportunities of influence on that power, if only because much of the staff of the Organisation at the lower levelshas to be recruited locally.6. The only Great Power site that would be considered is the UnitedStates, and the United States Government have indicated that in this case the locality would be San Francisco. San Francisco has an excellent climate andthe United States authorities would not hesitate to construct lavish facilities.But San Francisco is 30 hours&apos; flying time from Western Europe and evenmore from the Middle East and separated by an ocean from all the remainingPacific countries except Canada. Thus, even to China, the geographical advan-tage as compared with Western Europe would be very slight, while to the majorityof other countries the choice would be most inconvenient. There is also a strong objection from our point&apos;of view to the choice of San Francisco, since this wouldmean a constant &quot; invisible export &quot; for the United States just at a time whenthe whole world will be finding it difficult to make payments to them. Any siteoutside the United States would for a long time be preferable in this respect.7. European sites other than Geneva are practically ruled out by languagedifficulties and/or lack of amenities and accommodation. Geneva has the essentialbuildings which it will be impossible to obtain elsewhere for a long period,including the special building of the International Labour Organisation. Thelatter body, to say nothing of other specialised agencies, should be at the head-quarters of the Organisation if it is to exert its due influence in economic and social policy.12922   [30521]p copy No. vj O
8. Switzerland, because of her attachment to her neutral status, willperhaps not join the United Nations for some time, but the site of the presentLeague buildings together with a small portion of adjacent French territorycould be internationalised. This, together with the liquidation of the Leagueof Nations, should go a long way to remove the Soviet Union&apos;s objections to geneva, based on resentment against the League for her expulsion in. 1940 anddislike of Swiss policy during the war.9. It is sometimes argued that the site of the United Nations must be inthe United States in order to preserve American support for the Organisation.Many American experts, however, do not share this view, and there are obviousadvantages in frequent visits to Europe by United States Cabinet members and officials.10. It is also claimed that Geneva would be a bad choice because it. is associated with the &quot; failure&quot; of the League of Nations. But the choice ofGeneva would emphasise that we are facing the challenge of this &quot; failure&quot; andthat the United Nations has been constructed from the valuable experience of theLeague.Conclusions.11. I suggest, therefore, that our policy should be in the first instance to argue the case for the establishment of the site in Europe. We ought to havesupport for this from the European States, and, I should hope, from the middle eastern and some Latin American States. We ought to have a favourablereaction from the Dominions, though we cannot be sure of Australia and NewZealand. But above all I hope we may convince the United States Adminis-tration that it is in their interests to establish the seat of the United Nations inEurope.12. At a later stage we could argue the advantages of Geneva, and we must do everything we can to convince the Soviet Union of the advantages of Genevaover San Francisco.13. And if for an interval the United Nations must have only a temporaryhome, I think that it had better be in this country, where most of the peace treaties must be negotiated and where the Foreign Ministers&apos; will most frequentlymeet.P. J. N.-B.Foreign Office, .14th September, 1945.
