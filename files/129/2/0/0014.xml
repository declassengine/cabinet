Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET. Copy NCP. (45) 164.10th September, 1945.CABINET.CEYLON CONSTITUTION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the  Colonies.IN the conclusions of their meeting on the 3rd September (CM. (45)27th Conclusions) the Cabinet&apos;s approval is not recorded as covering the procedureset out in paragraph 11 (1) of the Report by the Chairman of the Colonial AffairsCommittee (CP. (45) 132 (Revise)) of the 31st August, which contemplated thaton Mr. Senanayake&apos;s return to Ceylon he should take with him for confidentialdisclosure to his Ministers, but not for general publication, copies of the SoulburyCommission^ Report, and that copies would also be made available to the IndiaOffice for transmission to Field-Marshal Lord Wavell, who would disclose themconfidentially to his Executive Council at the same time as copies were givento the Ceylon Board of Ministers. Thereafter, a suitable period would bearranged between the Secretary of State for India and myself during which theGovernment of India would formulate their conclusions, and after a further period of ten days, for the consideration of the Government of India&apos;s views, HisMajesty&apos;s Government would then convey to Mr. Senanayake their approval ofthe lines of the new Constitution for Ceylon as they might then decide upon. Thematter would at a convenient date thereafter be debated in the Ceylon state council, and arrangements would be made for the Soulbury Commission^ Reportto be published a few days before the Debate.2. Mr. Senanayake feels it necessary to return to Ceylon on the17th September for his political functions there, and I am anxious to let himknow before he leaves what procedure is proposed. I desire, therefore, to havemy colleagues&apos; approval of the procedure set out above.3. In accordance with the decisions reached by the Cabinet at their meetingon the 3rd&apos; September, I have had a discussion with Mr. Senanayake on constitutional reform in Ceylon. This discussion was entirely non-committal, but mr. Senanayake made it plain that his particular purpose, now that he has cometo England, is to request the grant to Ceylon of Dominion status, limited byagreement between the Ceylon Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government as tothe control which His Majesty&apos;s Government would require to exercise in relationto Defence and External Affairs. This of course is not the purpose for whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government invited him here. The invitation was concerned withthe proposals which would result from the Soulbury Commission^ visit.4. The time is not ripe to concede any substantial constitutional advance onthat adumbrated in the 1943 Declaration, and I shall leave Mr. Senanayake in nodoubt, when he consults his ministerial colleagues on his return to Ceylon, thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government adhere to the 1943 Declaration as the basis for thegrant of a new Constitution, and are not prepared to grant any form of dominion status.5.   I therefore seek my colleagues&apos; approval of the procedure set out inparagraph 1 of this Memorandum.G. H.Colonial Office, S.V/.1,10th September, 1945.[30496]
