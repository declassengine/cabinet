Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 173.llth September, 1945.CABINET.TELEVISION.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.AS my colleagues are aware the Prime Minister, when Lord President ofthe Council, appointed a Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Hankeyto prepare plans&apos; for the reinstatement of the television service after the war,giving special consideration to the extension of the service to the larger centres of population outside London within a reasonable period, the provision to bemade for research, and the guidance to be given to manufacturers with a viewespecially to the development of the export trade. This Committee reported inDecember 1944 and a copy of its report, which has been published, is attached,Annex II. The recommendations of the Committee are summarised on pp. 19-21of the report.2. Under the Coalition Government this report was first considered by theReconstruction Committee, who invited the Minister of Reconstruction to arrangefor its recommendations to be considered by the Ministerial Committee on broadcasting, which consisted of Minister of Reconstruction (in the Chair).The Lord President of the Council.The Minister of Information.The Postmaster-General.The Minister of State.The Broadcasting Committee did not finish its work before the Coalition Govern-ment broke up, but when we came into office there was available a draft report which represented a considerable measure of agreement on the part of our predecessors. I have been engaged, in conjunction with their successors in office,in considering our future broadcasting policy with a view to revising this draft report and submitting it for the consideration of the Cabinet. I hope to do this in the near future.3. In the meantime, however, a decision on television, which is a compara-tively self-contained subject and can be considered separately from generalbroadcasting policy, is urgently necessary in order that the service may now bereopened. The Broadcasting Committee had reached full agreement on thissubject and I attach the relevant extract from their draft report.   (Annex I.)4. The Minister of Information, the Postmaster-General, the Ministerof State and I have gone over the ground again and we now recommend to theCabinet that the views of the Broadcasting Committee should be accepted. as my colleagues will see, this means that we generally endorse the recommendationsof the Hankey Committee. Before the war this country led the world intelevision development and we consider that if we are to regain that position,which would be of material benefit to our export trade, there is not a moment to be lost in restoring the service. The President of the Board of Trade is,from this angle, anxious for an early decision.5. I, therefore, ask the Cabinet to authorise the Minister of Information,who is at present the Minister responsible for broadcasting and television,immediately to take such steps as are necessary to implement the recommenda-Uons of the Hankey Committee.[30527]
6. I would draw particular attention to the desirability of releasing fromtheir war-time appointments the small number of key technicians whosereturn to television is an essential preliminary to the re-opening of the service.The number involved is somewhere between 50 and: 100: - --------------.......7, My colleagues should also know that I have invited the Minister ofSupply and Aircraft Production to consider the desirability of using capacity in Royal Ordnance Eactories for the manufacture of television equipment. 1realise that technical or legal difficulties might arise in this connection but itseems to me that if television is to become a popular recreation and the home market is to be sufficient to support the large export trade which is open to us,something must be done to reduce the cost of television sets.H. M.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,12th September, 1945.&apos; ANNEX. I.Extract erom Draft Report of Broadcasting Committee.TELEVISION,AT the invitation of the Reconstruction Committee (R. (45) 9th Meeting)we have considered the recommendations in the report of the TelevisionCommittee. This report has already been published and. a copy of it is attached(Annex II). A summary of the recommendations will be found in paragraph 79(pages 19-21).We are in general agreement with the Committee&apos;s recommendations and wesuggest that, subject to the points set out below, they should be accepted by theCabinet as the general basis of our television policy in the immediate future. Inparticular, we are satisfied that the reopening of the British television service should not be delayed until some fundamental improvement can be incorporated in the system and we recommend that early action should be taken: to secure therelease of a sufficient number of key-men from the Services to enable the first stepsto be taken for reopening a public television service.The points arising out of the Television Committee&apos;s report to which we wish to draw attention are : (a) Responsible Minister. Although we agree with the Committee that thegeneral responsibility for television policy should vest in the minister or Ministers responsible for broadcasting, we think that, in view ofthe potential importance of the television industry and the contribu-tion which it may make to our export trade, the Board of trade should be kept in very close touch with the development of policy.(b) Advisory Committee.-While we agree that the Minister responsible for television will require the help of some form of Advisory Committee,it would&apos;be unwise to accept the recommendation in paragraph 13 ofthe report as it stands, since this would fetter the freedom of theMinister to seek advice from whatever source and by whatever meanshe thought best.(c) Patents. The Television Committee recommend that the main manu-facturing firms should be encouraged to pool their television patentswith a view to ensuring that such patents are made available for use as the national interest may demand. The whole future of Britishpatent law is already under consideration by the Board of Trade, andwe suggest that in stating the attitude of the Government to thisrecommendation it should be made clear that patents in the televisionindustry must be considered in relation to the general policy of theGovernment in regard to patents, and that the responsible minister will concert his policy on this subject with the President of the Boardof Trade.

THE TELEVISION COMMITTEEJ943REPORTThe Right Hon. Clement R. Attlee, M.P.,Lord President of the CouncilINTRODUCTION1. Wo were appointed, in September, 1943, with the following terms ofreference:   ,&quot; To prepare plans for the reinstatement and development of the tele-vision service after the war with special consideration of (a) the preparation of a plan for the provision of a service to atany rate the larger centres of population within a reasonable period after the war; &apos;(b) the provision to be made for research and development;(c) the guidance to be given to manufacturers, with a view especially to the development of the export trade.&quot;Reference to the appointment of the Committee was made in the Plouse ofCommons on the 18th January, 1944..2. Our first meeting took place on the 26th October, 1943, and we have held 31 meetings in all. We have examined a number of witnesses, a listof whom is given in Appendix I, representing many different interests. Wehave also had -the benefit of numerous written statements from official and other sources bearing on a variety of aspects of Television, and we havewitnessed demonstrations of Television carried out by such apparatus as was available under war-time conditions.PRE-WAR TELEVISION SERVICE3. It may be useful at the outset briefly to trace the steps which hadbeen taken, or were under active consideration at the outbreak of war in1939, to implement the recommendations made for the establishment anddevelopment of a public television service in Great Britain in the Reportof the first Television Committee, under the Chairmanship of the lateLord Selsdon, in 1935 (Command Paper 4793).4. The first public service of high definition television, in this or anyother country, was inaugurated at the British Broadcasting Corporation^television station at Alexandra Palace in November, 1936. The transmissionswere at first provided during alternate weeks by two rival systems, Bairdand Marconi-E.M.L, but in February, 1937, the Television Advisory Com-, mittee which on the recommendation of the Selsdon Committee had beenappointed by the Postmaster-General in 1935 to advise on the developmentof Television came to the conclusion that the Marcohi-B.M.I. was the better system; and thereafter that system alone was employed. A descrip-tion of the system is given in Appendix II.5. By 1939 the service had reached a high standard; the programmetechnique had made great progress, and the result was a service of consider-able entertainment value. The number of television receivers in use bythe public did not,  however, rise appreciably above 20,000.    This was
ascribed, inter alia, to the cost of sets ( 20 to  75), the belief that the price would soon fall, and the fear of obsolescence. The restriction of the service to the London area no doubt gave rise to the impression that the service was still in the experimental stage. Nevertheless, a demand for the exten-sion of the television service to the provinces became insistent; it was urged in Parliament, in the Press, and by the radio industry.6-. The Selsdon Committee had envisaged the ultimate extension of a.television service throughout the country, and in December, 1938, theAdvisory Committee reported that two years&apos; experience of its operation in the London area justified the formulation of a plan for a service on a semi-national scale to bring Television within reach of the majority of thedensely populated areas of Great Britain. Four provincial stations in theneighbourhood of Birmingham, Huddersfield, Falkirk and Bristol were proposed, as well as an improvement of the London television station.7. Certain technical problems involved in relaying Television (whetherby cable or radio link) remained to be solved; but the main difficulty whichhad to be faced in the development of the television service was that offinance. The Advisory Committee emphasised, however, that the issue was not merely one of providing entertainment for a limited number ofpersons, or even of laying the foundations of a national service, but ofbuilding up an important new industry in the manufacture of televisionapparatus; and bearing in mind that Great Britain was the pioneer of Tele-vision, they advocated the adoption of a courageous policy in developing the service with a view to placing manufacturers in this country in a strong position for establishing a valuable export trade.8. Consideration of the Advisory Committee&apos;s proposals had not beencompleted when, on the approach of war (1st September, 1939), the&apos;AlexandraPalace television station was shut down for military reasons.WAR-TIME  RESEARCH9. Although in the early stages of the war research work was planned in several directions, the increasing demands of the war made it impossibleto maintain any organised research, and as a result little progress has in themeantime been made in this country in broadcast television. More efforthas been directed to broadcast television development in other countries of which we have taken due account.10. Radiolocation owes much to past research work on Television, butwar research has produced little information and no discovery of a fundamental character bearing directly on Television, although it has very greatly extended the technique of the radio engineer. In addition, wardemands have had the effect of greatly &quot;increasing the number of skilled men and women who will.eventually be available in all grades for the workof development, design and maintenance of Television.TELEVISION ORGANISATION11. Before the war the Minister responsible for Television on behalfof the Government was the Postmaster-General. The question of future arrangements is part of the wider subject of the relations between theGovernment and the British Broadcasting Corporation and is beyond ourcompetence, but we think that the Minister responsible to Parliament forsound broadcasting should also be responsible for Television.[29054] o*
12. Following the recommendation of the Selsdon Committee, theoriginal television service was operated by the same authority as was responsible for sound broadcasting, namely the British broadcasting corporation. We share that. Committee&apos;s view on the close relationship which must exist between the two services, and we recommend that thepost-war television service should likewise be operated by the sameauthority as is entrusted with the sound broadcasting service, i.e., by theBritish Broadcasting Corporation..13. Another of the Selsdon Committee&apos;s recommendations, already referred to in paragraph 4, was the setting up of an Advisory Committee,which did valuable work in the development of Television before the war.We recommend, as an essential part of our proposals for the reinstatementand development of the television service after the war, the appointmentby the Minister responsible for Broadcasting of a corresponding Committeeto fulfil a similar purpose, at any rate until the service is more or lessstabilised. The suggested constitution and functions of this AdvisoryCommittee are more fully described in paragraph 62.PROVISION  AND DEVELOPMENT  OF  POST-WAR  service a. PolicyReinstatement of the 1939 service in London14. The television service in Great Britain before the war was theonly regular broadcast television service anywhere in the world. It had,however, been in operation for only 2^ years, and was available only inthe area of the London station. The service was new, and improvement and development were to be expected; for instance, the quality of picturegiven by the television receiver was related to a standard of definition of405 lines. This standard of definition gives a very satisfactory picture (ofthe order of 8 in. by 10 in.) in the home, but it is not adequate for the largecinema screen which requires a definition equivalent to a standard of theorder of 1,000 lines.15. Had it not been for the war, developments and progress would doubtless&apos;have taken their ordinary course, but the fact of the interruptioncaused by the war raises the question whether, instead of re-opening the television service on the old basis, the re-opening should be delayed for asufficient time to give an opportunity for the incorporation of fundamentalimprovements, such as an advance towards a higher standard of definition.16. We have reached the conclusion, which is supported by a large majority of our witnesses, that the right course in the existing circumstancesis to re-open the television service on the basis of the 405-line system ratherthan to wait for the development of a new television system as the resultof research. The reasons influencing us in reaching this conclusion are asfollows:  (a) The Alexandra Palace television transmissions had by September, 1939,achieved a high degree of reliability and afforded consistently goodentertainment value in the home, and it is to be expected that,with more experience coupled with certain minor refinementswhich it is now possible to introduce, the pre-war system willgive still better results. Moreover, many of the receivers on themarket in pre-war days failed to do justice to the signals whichwere actually transmitted, and there are good reasons for thinking that with transmissions of greater efficiency and the use  of
receivers of better design and quality, the good entertainmentvalue of the 1939 (405-line) service should soon be surpassed.   .(b) A good deal of research and development, as well as new studiosand other buildings, will be required before a markedly improvedservice can be put into operation. Owing to war demands on scientific and other staff and on materials it is improbable that much progress could be made in this country on such work before&apos; the end of hostilities in Europe, and some years would be likelyto elapse before the new service would be available to the public.To leave a gap of some years without any television service would damp interest and seriously retard commercial developmentof the television industry in this country.(c) The re-establishment of a television service as soon as possible afterthe war is important from the point of view of preventing the dispersal of the highly specialised staffs (now engaged on warwork) who were employed on Television by the British Broad-casting Corporation and the industry in pre-war days. A certainnumber of men and women who have acquired appropriateexperience during the war will no doubt find employment on television, but they will of course constitute only a fraction ofthe mimbers trained in radio work of one kind or another duringthe war.(d) It is very desirable that before the introduction   of   a   new  and improved system, which will involve novel problems, the operatingauthority should have an opportunity with the 405-line system to consolidate and develop still further the valuable experience gainedbefore the war on both the technical and programme sides of television. Moreover, any other course would involve discardingthe old television receiving sets still held by the public.(e) It. is most important that there should be no avoidable delay inrestarting a television service if this country is to hold a leadingposition in the television field.17. Our recommendation, therefore, is that the pre-war system of Tele-vision on the basis of 405-line definition should be restarted in* London(Alexandra Palace) as soon as possible after the cessation of hostilities inEurope. The service could, we believe, be in operation within nine to twelve months of the release of the requisite staff (see paragraph 30).Extension to the Provinces18. If -our recommendation to re-open the service in London on thebasis of 405-line definition is approved, the question arises whether that system should be extended to the provinces, or whether extension to theprovinces should wait until a new and improved system is available.19. We have mentioned (see paragraph 5) that before the war therewas considerable pressure for the extension of the television service to theprovinces, and this demand&apos; will almost certainly be even more insistentafter the war. Apart from this consideration, it should be borne in mind that it is only by extension to the main centres of population in this country that the public will be convinced that Television has passed the experimentalstage. Extension over a wide area is essential if there is to be a full development of the television industry, particularly in the manufacture of television receiving sets, and it is only by creating an increased demand,consequent upon a wide extension of Television to the provinces, that thefull benefits of mass production, with resultant reduction in price, can beachieved.[29054]c* 2
20. It would, however, obviously be unjustifiable to proceed with a rapid extension of the old television system to the provinces if the intention was to discard it after a-very few years in favour of an entirely new one;but we believe that the old system will continue to appeal to many peopleeven after a new system has been introduced.21. Should the introduction of a new system mean that two entirely separate programmes would be needed (one for the new system and anotherfor the old), the financial problems would become much more serious and a review of the recommendation to re-open the service on the old standardmight be entailed. On the assumption,&apos; however, which we believe to bewell founded, that the same programme can be used for the two systems(although separate transmitters would be necessary), we think that develop-ment plans should be made on the assumption that the two systems wouldbe operated side by side for some time. Television manufacturers, as wellas viewers, will expect that for a reasonable period receiving sets of theold type will not become obsolete.22. As a matter of practice the choice is not, of course, between openingon the old basis throughout the country at once or deferring extension tothe provinces until a new system is available. Time will be required both for the design and construction of radio or cable links for the dissemination of Television to the main provincial centres and also for the construction oftransmitters and transmitting stations. There will, therefore, be an oppor-tunity to keep the position under review in the few years following therecommencement of the service.23. Our conclusion is that extension of Television to the provincesshould be planned on the basis of the old system, but that the actual scopeof extension of this system to provincial centres should, be kept underreview by the Advisory Committee in the light of the general conditions prevailing at each stage, including the progress made in the developmentof a new system (see paragraph 24).Improved Television Service24. In view of the inherent limitations of a television system based on405-line definition it is essential, if this country is not to lag behind in the television field, that vigorous research work with the aim of producing aradically improved system of Television should begin immediately staffcan be made available.25. We have taken a great deal of evidence on this important question and there is strong support for the view, with which we agree, that the aim should be to approach the cinema standard. We think that televisiondefinition should eventually be of the order of 1,000 lines and that theintroduction of colour and stereoscopic effects should be considered.26. Our recommendation is that vigorous research work on a radicallyimproved system of Television (see paragraphs 40 to 47) should beginimmediately staff can be made available. -       &apos; -B. PlansReinstatement of the 1939 service in London27. The essential requirements for the rapid reinstatement of the 1939service of Television in London are as follow&quot;s:  (a) The release of the Alexandra Palace from its present war uses atthe earliest possible moment consistent wdtli the maintenance ofthe war effort, and its reconditioning for television transmission.
Alexandra Palace is far from ideal for television purposes, butto provide soon after the war an alternative site with new buildings, which would almost certainly be required, would involveexcessive delay. It must, therefore, continue to be the main programme production centre at all events until a new system is introduced. The reconditioning of the Alexandra Palacepremises, together with certain indispensable improvements which will absorb only a relatively small amount of building labour should be completed in ivom six to nine months, when,after a short period of testing, it should be possible to re-open the London television service.(b) The return of a limited number of persons at the earliest possible moment at which their release from war work can be effected(i) to the British Broadcasting Coloration and its contractors forreconstituting the Alexandra Palace television station; (ii) to thePost Office and its contractors for research work on the relayingof Television by cable and radio links (see paragraph 46), and(iii) to the radio industry for work preparatory to the productionof television receiving sets and other essential equipment.(c) Allocation of the necessary frequencies (see paragraph 38).(d) As much notice as possible to the radio industry of the date onwhich television broadcasts will begin. The industry estimate that it may be possible to produce television receivers within nine months of the date at which staff is released and permits aregiven for obtaining material.Extension to the Provinces28. Our recommendations for the extension of Television to theprovinces are as follows :  (a) Initially, the programme should provide for the establishment, assoon as practicable after the reinstatement of the service inLondon, of television services in possibly six of the most populouscentres in the provinces, the selection of the centres and theorder of provision of the services being left for consideration bythe Advisory Committee in the light of the technical and other relevant conditions prevailing at the time. The rate at whichtelevision services can be provided at these centres will dependnot only on the availability of adequate technical staff and materials, but also on the progress made in research on the tech-nical problems of relaying television signals. We hope that itmay be found possible to provide a service from a television-station situated in the Birmingham area within about a year of the re-establishment of the London service, and that otherstations on either the old or the new system will follow in anordered sequence.(b) Studio programmes should be relayed by the provincial stations fromthe main programme centre in London (Alexandra Palace). Therelay links between Alexandra Palace and the provincial stationsmay be provided either by cable or radio.Improved Television Service29. Our recommendations for the planning of an improved system of television, with a standard of definition approaching that of the cinemaand incorporating possibly colour and stereoscopic effects, are as follows:  (a) The aim should be to offer the new service to the public as soonas possible after the necessary research and development have
been completed. A receiver designed for reception of trans-missions on the 405-line standard of definition will not be suitablefor the reception of programmes transmitted by the proposed^new system, but, as we have already indicated (see paragraph 21),we envisage that for w a time, the length of which cannot be fore-cast, the new system will be operated side by side with the 405-linesystem.(b) The production of the-new system should be open to competitionamong all firms probably only a small number capable of undertaking the production of a complete system. The AdvisoryCommittee should satisfy itself that the use of any patenteddevices which may be embodied in the transmission system doesnot prejudice the general interests of British manufacturers intheir export business or in the sale of television receivers.Release of staff and materials30. As already indicated in paragraph 9, television development hasbeen at a standstill in this country since 1939 owing to the total mobilisation of all scientific and industrial resources in the interests of the war effort.From information we have received, however, this would not appear to havebeen the case in all countries, and it is therefore all the more important that the necessary staff and materials should be released immediately theyare required for carrying out the plans set out in paragraphs 27-29 above in order that the time lost in this country in the development of Televisionduring the war may, as far as possible, be made good in the immediate post-war years.TELEVISION  IN THE  CINEMA31. Whilst we have so far dealt primarily with the problem of providing atelevision service for reception in the home, we have also not been unmindfulof the potentiality of cinemas for displaying television programmes.32. Before the war certain firms were interesting themselves in theproduction of apparatus for this aspect of Television, and a few cinemashad acquired equipment capable of projecting a picture of large size onthe screen from a position in the stalls. Such apparatus was used withsome success on a few occasions when events of outstanding public interestwere televised, and arrangements were in hand for similarly equipping othercinemas when the television service was closed down.33. There is, however, agreement in the evidence Of representatives ofboth the cinema industry and of manufacturers of equipment that the definition of the 1939 system is not high enough for large-screen reproductionin cinemas and that the television standard of definition must approachthat of the cinema before large-screen Television will be generally acceptable.Whatever attractions Television in the cinema had before the war were mainly due to its noveltj- and to the special public appeal of the particularevents selected for display, and according to evidence before the Committeecinemas in general are likely to await the advent of the new S3?stem beforeincurring the cost of providing television projection equipment.34. We are satisfied from the evidence we have taken that the cinemaindustry fully recognises the important part that Television is destined toplay in the future in the field of public entertainment, although it does notat present feel able to gauge- the degree of public response to Televisionin the cinema. We are, however, encouraged by the evidence to believethat the cinema industry and the British Broadcasting Corporation, working
in collaboration and not as competitors in the exploitation of Television,will achieve considerable results of a character beneficial to both.35. The question arises whether development of Television in thecinema is likely to prove detrimental to that of Television in the home, orwhether, on the other hand, Television in the home is likely to be harmfulto cinema interests. In the case of sound broadcasting, the competition ofwhich was at first viewed with concern by the Press and the entertainmentworld, experience has shown that there was no cause for apprehension, andour evidence suggests that although Television in the home would compete with the cinema for the public&apos;s interest the existence side by side ofthe two forms of entertainment should, on the whole, prove mutually helpfulrather than otherwise, and that home and cinema television are likely tohave a stimulating effect on each other.36. At the same time the use of television programmes for publicperformance raises very real problems. Performers or those controllingthem may refuse appearances for Television if they feel that theperformances are to be exploited by third parties from whom they deriveno direct benefit and over whom they have no control. Authors andcomposers may&apos;be reluctant to permit the use of their material for similar reasons. The public showing by third parties of sporting and other publicevents upon which events the popularity of Television will in large measuredepend introduces special difficulties which were already being experiencedbefore Television was closed clown at the outbreak of war.37. We recommend that in planning the television service close atten-tion should be given by the Advisory Committee to the possibilities of its use by cinemas, bearing in mind the difficulties to which we have referredlest they seriously prejudice the development of the service.FREQUENCIES  AND ELECTRICAL  INTERFERENCEFrequencies38. It will be necessary to obtain agreement with the various interests concerned on the allocation of frequencies suitable for television transmission.Preliminary enquiries which have been made give good reason for hoping that it will be possible to meet the requirements of the 405-line television service, both in London and the, provinces, without prejudice to the claims of other interests. The Advisory Committee should, however, keep thequestion of frequencies under review, especially for the new system, andshould satisfy themselves that appropriate frequencies will be availablefor the television service as and when they are required.Electrical Interference39. We understand that a considerable number of complaints weremade of electrical interference with the reception of pre-war television programmes. As potential sources of electrical interference are likely tobe far more numerous after the war, it is in our opinion vital to the successof Television that the Postmaster-General should be granted the necessary powers to enforce suppression of such interference.RESEARCH ORGANISATION40. We have already recommended that - research work should beginas soon as possible on the development of a radically improved system of
Television (see paragraph 26), and we have given much thought to theway in which this and other cognate research activities might best be organised and developed.41. Two entirely different courses of action have been suggested. Ithas been proposed to, us on the one hand, that there should be completeunification of research effort of all interested firms in the formation of aR-esearch Association with membership open to all, and on the other thata policy should be adopted which, in practice, would result in leaving the development of the improved system to competition between large firms apart from certain research work on fundamental radio problems suchas wave propagation which would probably in any case be undertaken by government institutions.42. We do not favour either of these proposals, but suggest insteadthe adoption of a middle course under which television research would become-ordinated, whilst individual effort would receive all possible encourage-menfc. We attach great importance to collaboration between all the interests concerned, but we also feel that the utmost care ought to be taken toavoid stifling or hampering initiative and competition in any way.43. We recognise that it will not be easy for a firm engaged on researchto decide the exact point at which information should be disclosed an ideamight have to be worked out fairly fully before it was clear whether ornot it would prove to be of real value; on the other hand the withholding ofinformation too. long might well lead to wasteful employment of the timeand energies of other research workers. We feel that if the co-ordinationof television research were carried out under Government auspices by a body which would command the full confidence of industry generally away out of these difficulties y/ould be found, and we suggest that the taskshould be entrusted to the Advisory Committee.44. The Government research organisations of the Department of scientific and Industrial Research would, we are assured, be j^reparecl toassist the industry in any way possible in the development of Television.That Department is also in close touch with the Universities where muchpure research is carried out, in which realm it is always possible thatdiscoveries may be made having an important bearing on television development.   &apos;45. The British Broadcasting Corporation will doubtless be able to assistconsiderably in co-ordinating effort: in the development of an improvedtelevision system in such matters as control circuits, studio gear, layoutand lighting.46. The Post Office will assume responsibility for the resumption of research work on the outstanding problems relative to &quot;the relaying of television by cable and radio links.47. It must be recognised that certain aspects of television researchcannot be isolated from research on telecommunications problems generally and from progress in other fields, e.g., important optical developmentsincluding the possible use of plastics.PATENTS-48. We have given much thought to -the subject of patents in relationto Television as we consider that they are of fundamental importance in thedevelopment of the television service, affecting as they do transmitting and receiving apparatus and both the home and the export trade.
49. Our aim is the establishment of the best television service, andthe problem therefore is to find an arrangement which will secure the incor-poration in the future television system of all British inventions which will contribute to its efficiency and at the same time provide encouragement to, and fair reward for, inventive research on the part of individual firms.The fact that only one transmitting system as distinct from receivingapparatus will probably be chosen for the new British television servicemakes the problem of special difficulty.50. Like the Selsdon Committee (see paragraph 53 of their Report) wethink that the ideal solution would be the formation of a comprehensivepatent pool which would be available to all interested firms, and we have reviewed the possibility of establishing such a pool. We are satisfied, how-ever, that a patent pool would not be successful in practice unless it werearranged by the industry itself.51. In our view, the problem is essentially one for the industry; butwe recommend that the main manufacturing firms should be encouragedin every possible way to pool their television patents and that the AdvisoryCommittee should, as opportunity offers, bring its influence to bear onthe owners of such patents with a view to ensuring that they are madeavailable for use as the national interest may demand.EXPORT  MARKET52. In item (c) of our terms of reference we are expressly enjoined toconsider . &quot; the guidance to be given to manufacturers with a view especially tothe development of the export trade.&apos;&apos;We have found the industry very much alive to this aspect of television and we have derived much assistance from their evidence, as well as fromthat of Sir William Palmer, Principal Industrial Adviser to the Board ofTrade.53. There are obvious advantages in the development of an export tradeapart from its direct financial return. It would stimulate the export of sound, broadcasting apparatus and would demonstrate the technical ability inBritish manufacture which in cognate fields (Radiolocation, &amp;c.) has been of such vital importance during the war and which before -the war put theUnited Kingdom in a leading position in the art of Television.54. The devotion of all our resources to the prosecution of the war has inevitably stopped progress in television technique in this country, andmoreover our position relative to other countries may have been weakened,to an extent which we are unable to gauge, by progress made in Televisionabroad during the war. On the other hand this country was before thewar the only nation that had succeeded in establishing a regular publictelevision service and the operation of this service afforded valuable experi-ence and a nucleus of staff fully trained in all branches of the subject.55. There is general agreement in the evidence we have taken that thefirst step towards building up an export trade is to popularise Televisionat home, and to show the world that as a nation we have become &quot; television-conscious,&quot; and have in being a service available in the provinces as wellas in London of a standard that meets with the approval of the british public. A flourishing home market in television receivers is an essential pre-requisite of an export trade. Concurrently with development at home, con-tinuous attention should be paid to the possibility of developing the exporttrade.   The responsibility for doing so must lie with the industry which
Television (see paragraph 26), and we have given much thought to theway in which this and other cognate research activities might best be organised and developed.41. Two entirely different courses of action have been suggested. Ithas been proposed to, us on the one hand, that there should be completeunification of research effort of all interested firms in the formation of research Association with membership open to all, and on the other thata policy should be adopted which, in practice, would result in leaving the development of the improved system to competition between large firms apart from certain research work on fundamental radio problems suchas wave propagation which would probably in any case be undertaken by government institutions.42. We do not favour either of these proposals, but suggest insteadthe adoption of a middle course under which television research would become-ordinated, whilst individual effort would receive all possible eneourage-ment. We attach great importance to collaboration between all the interests concerned, but we also feel that the utmost care ought to be taken toavoid stifling or hampering initiative and competition in any way.43.

A flourishing home market in television receivers is an essential pre-requisite of an export trade. Concurrently with development at home, con-tinuous attention should be paid to the possibility of developing the exporttrade.   The responsibility for doing so must lie with the industry which
should, however, keep in close touch with the Advisory Committee in thematter as the normal channel for communication with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.56. Opportunities for export will, we think, arise especially if the tele-vision service in this country meets with the success which we expect. Itis important that any such opportunities should not be lost since the nationwhich succeeds in establishing itself first in the television industry abroadwill undoubtedly obtain a great advantage. There are, however, limitationsto the early development of a large export market which it would be wrong to under-estimate. For some time only industrialised countries with largecentres of population will- be able to afford Television, and some such countries, particularly the United States of America, will manufactureapparatus themselves; but others may be expected to look abroad for supplies if an attractive service can be offered at a reasonable price.57.   Our advice is (a) that the successful development of Television at home is of prime importance to the development of an export trade;(fa) tliat while the industry itself must be responsible for the clevelop-ment of the export trade and should keep a close watch on thepossibilities and prospects, it should keep in close touch with theAdvisory Committee as the normal channel for communicationwith the appropriate Minister;(c) that the Advisory Committee should keep the Government advisedof developments in the television system so that these might bebrought to the notice of Dominion and foreign Governments; and(d) that every opportunity should be taken to include exhibits illustratingBritish television in overseas exhibitions in- which the BritishGovernment participates.INTERNATIONAL STANDARDISATION58. American pre-war television standards were based on 525 lines perpicture compared with the British pre-war standard of 405 lines. Apartfrom other considerations this fact might lead to the conclusion that theAmerican system would give a picture of better quality than the Britishsystem, but in practice the difference is not significant. The variation inthe number of lines per picture in the two svstems is in fact unimportantcompared with other technical differences which are much more likely to affect the quality of the received picture.59. Before, however, we reached the decision to recommend the reinstatement ox a television service in this country on the pre-war(405-line) standard (see paragraph 17), we gave much thought to various considerations for and against the adoption of a 525-line standard for theimmediate post-war service in this country, apart from that -of the quality of the pictures produced by the two systems. The most important of these considerations was that of international standardisation, which we regard as being, in itself, highly desirable, since only by the adoption of commonstandards will the interchange of programmes between one country andanother be rendered practicable. The day is probably distant when trans-oceanic exchanges of programmes will be possible, but across land frontiersthey already present no technical, as distinct from political, difficulties;and between Great Britain and countries across the narrow seas, with relayst6* continental countries further afield, the technical difficulties are notinsuperable.
60. A change to the American standard so far as the number of linesis concerned would not technically be a very serious matter. The receiving-sets already in the hands of the public and any pre-war stock held by thetrade designed for a 405-line service would need to be adjusted to render them capable of producing a 525-line picture; but many of these sets will need reconditioning in any case and the requisite additional adjustmentswould not be very difficult provided adequate labour was available. Anincreased delay would, however, be involved in restoring the equipment atAlexandra Palace, which we regard as being most undesirable; and an even more cogent argument against the change lies in the fact that to bringthe British post-war system entirely into line with the American system,so as to render British and American television apparatus interchangeable,would involve more serious problems than a mere change in the numberof lines, e.g., the picture signals in the two systems are transmitted withopposite polarities and the frequency of the electricity supply in each case is not the same. It is, moreover, doubtful whether a fundamental&quot; changeof this kind would result in an overall improvement of the British pre-war service; and in view of all the circumstances, and notwithstanding thedesirability of standardisation per se, we decided against making sucha change.61. We would urge, however, that the ideal of internationalstandardisation of Television should be kept constantly in mind, and asa first step towards its attainment we suggest that the earliest opportunity should be taken of reaching international agreement on the bands o frequencies to be allocated to Television. We understand that the matter is likely to receive consideration at an International TelecommunicationsConference which will doubtless be held fairly early in the post-war period.Later, as research on a new and improved system of Television proceedsin this and other countries but before work on the new system has gonetoo far, we recommend that the Advisory Committee should suggestwhatever action it may appear to be practicable to take with a view to bringing about international agreement for the adoption of common televisionADVISOBY COMMITTEE62. We propose that the Advisory Committee, the appointment of whichwas recommended in paragraph 13, should include representatives of theTreasury, the General Post Office, the Department of Scientific andIndustrial Research and the British Broadcasting Corporation, with a chairman of standing, and that its functions should be as follows :  (a) To advise the responsible Minister on questions of major policy witha view to the development of Television on sound lines  (see paragraphs 11, 23 and 25).(6) To recommend, after consultation with the industry, a plan for thefuture television service, including the standards to be aimed at(see paragraphs 28 (a), 29 (6) and 38).(c) To co-ordinate and, where necessary, to initiate research and to giveguidance without discouraging individual effort; to seek expertopinion freely, and to do its utmost to promote goodwill between all concerned (see paragraph 43).(d) To  encourage pooling of patents and their use in the national interest (see paragraph 51).(e) To watch all  developments of Television at home  and abroad,including its use for cinemas, bearing in mind the importance of export trade and the desirability of the adoption of internationaltelevision standards (see paragraphs 37, 57 (b) and 61).
(/) To advise on any problem in. connexion witn the television service which may from time to time be referred to it by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment or the British Broadcasting Corporation.tFINANCE63. Before the war expenditure on the British Broadcasting Corporation^services was met from a grant, voted by Parliament, equivalent to an agreedproportion of the proceeds from the sale of wireless licences, after deduction of collection and other costs incurred by the Post Office. The annualproportion for all broadcasting services was stated in the Licence attachedto the Corporation^ Charter of the 1st January, 1937. at 75 per cent, of net licence receipts, with a proviso that the percentage might be increased on consideration of representations made by the Corporation. For theyear 1939 the proportion was 89 per cent, of net licence receipts of which11 per cent. ( 450,000) was in respect of the television service. In view ofthe increase in costs since 1939, the contemplated rapid development ofthe television service, and the prospect that a new television system involving-ing additional expenditure may be introduced in a few years&apos; &apos;time, thepre-war arrangements for financing the television service will need to bere considered.64. As a result of conditions arising&quot;out of the war, a review of thearrangements for financing the Corporation^ services generally became necessary and since 1940 they have been financed directly by exchequer grants (administered by the Minister of Information) having no directrelationship to the proceeds from licences. This arrangement will doubtlessrequire modification to meet post-war conditions. In view of the closerelationship between the television and sound broadcasting services it wouldseem that a final conclusion on the financing of the television servicecannot be reached until the general arrangements for financing the Corpora-tion&apos;s sound broadcasting services after the war have been settled. Thiswider question is, of course, a matter outside our province.65. It is difficult to make any close estimate of the cost of the tele-vision service after the war, but on the re-opening of the service in theLondon area the expenditure may be put at roughly  1 million a year.With the opening of possibly six provincial stations over a period of, say,five years, the yearly costs may rise to something like  If millions; therewill also be capital outlay of about &amp;1\ millions. It must be emphasised that these figures represent broad approximations only.66. At the present stage, when the nature of the contemplated newtelevision system is still undecided, it is quite impossible to hazard anyguess as to its costs, but its introduction, including the cost of research, will undoubtedly involve a further substantial increase in expenditure.67. Apart from any arrangements which may be made in connexionwith the general financial settlement as between the Exchequer and theCorporation after the war, there appear to be three possible sources withinthe television service itself from which revenue might be drawn to financeit, namely, a special television licence fee for domestic viewers, a specialtelevision licence fee for cinema showing, and sponsored programmes. Weha^e considered each of these three possible sources of revenue.Television Licence for Domestic Viewers68. In the early days of the television service when the number ofviewers will inevitably be small, a television licence fee would produce onlya very small proportion of the total revenue required; but we share the
view of our predecessors who have considered the point that there shouldbe a licence fee for Television in addition to the licence fee for sound broad-casting, and we recommend that a special licence for domestic viewersshould be introduced on the re-opening of the television service. Initiallywe suggest that the additional fee for television reception might be  1a year.Cinema Television Licence69. The cinema interests have made it clear to us in evidence that,excepting possibly in the case of isolated events, they will not desire to embark on the use of Television in cinemas before the new television system has been adopted, but that when that stage has been reached they will almost certainly want to do so; and in our view those interests should beexpected to make a contribution towards the television costs. While weclearly cannot look for any large revenue from this source in the early stages of development of the television service, it may become an importantsource of revenue in the future, and we accordingly suggest that a cinematelevision licence should be introduced at a special fee. At the present stage it is unprofitable to consider in detail what the amount of the feeshould be, and in our view the question of the date for its introductionshould also be left for later consideration.Sponsored Programmes70. A sponsored programme may be defined as a programme paid for by commercial interests for the purpose of advertisement. The questionwhether sponsored television programmes should be allowed is a matter to which much, consideration lias been given in the past and wo recognisethat it raises issues wider than purely financial ones. &quot;It is quite clear that until the television service is well developed commercial interests wouldnot be willing to incur large expenditure for this purpose owing, for example,to the limited audience served. In the early stages, therefore, we couldnot expect sponsored programmes to provide a substantial, contribution towards the cost of the television, service. In these circumstances, andwithout prejudicing the matter for the future, we feel it would be premature to come to a conclusion on this question.Summary71. We are all agreed that the aim should be to&apos; make the television service self-supporting at as early a stage as possible. It is clear, however,that the revenue accruing from the television service itself could not besufficient to meet its cost, and that such revenue will need to be supple-mented for some years after the resumption of the service, whether bysubvention from the Exchequer or by some other arrangement made inconnexion with the general financial agreement with the British Broad-casting Corporation. The precise method to be adopted cannot be settlednow if only for the reason that under pre-war practice the finance of television was linked with that of the sound broadcasting services; andthis will be one of the factors which will fall to be considered in deter-mining the nature of the general financial agreement between the Exchequerand the Corporation.PROSPECTS  OE  TELEVISION72. Before the war Television as an art was in its infancy. In the short period of its existence less than three years-before the exigencies of war cut short its career, and operating only&apos; in the London area, it had
to win its way in an atmosphere of doubt and scepticism; nevertheless, aswe have already recorded, a high level of performance was achieved. TheBritish Broadcasting Corporation showed&quot; that by developing new methodsof production and experimenting with the artistic possibilities of Television,it was possible to cover a remarkable field of historic and interesting events,talks, entertainment and news, and to communicate such items in a com-pletely new way to the public. In this respect it was generally agreed thatBritish television was ahead of all others.73. After the war Television should start in a more favourable atmosphere-phere. Its connection with Radiolocation is well known, and, notwith-standing the secrecy in which the latter has necessarily been veiled, the achievements of our men of science in this field have profoundly impressedthe British rmblio. As we have already remarked, we believe that the405-line service is capable of maintaining a wide success even after theintroduction of a new service and we envisage the continuance of a service on that standard for some time side by side with a service of an improvedtype. The improvements in performance of both transmitters and receivers,which it is expected will be realised as a result of the introduction of anumber of technical refinements, coupled with better arrangements forservicing receivers than in pre-war days, should encourage the purchaseof sets.74. The extension of the service to large centres of population outside london will greatly increase the demand for receivers; their price, whichat first will be higher than before the war, should fall, particularly whenthe stage of mass production is reached. In the educational field also,we believe that Television opens up considerable possibilities. But it is inthe televising of actual events, the ability to give the viewer a front-rowseat at almost every possible kind of exciting or memorable spectacle, thatTelevision will perform its greatest service.75. It is, of course, notoriously difficult to forecast a development ofpublic taste, but for the above reasons, and judging from the success of sound broadcasting, we are convinced that a television service on thepre-war system will be popular.76. It is more difficult to judge the prospects of a new and improvedservice. Cinemas may be expected to make considerable use of such a service, and by the time the new service can be introduced people in thiscountry may have become so &quot; television-conscious &quot; that they will want to possess the best in their homes. The price of a receiver suitable for thenew system will, however, be higher than for a 405-line receiver, and theremay well be an appreciable section of the community able and willing to buy receivers of the latter type which will not be able to afford receiversfor a higher definition service at all events in the early days of its development. Feeling strongly as we do that the television service in thiscountry ought to be made available to the maximum number of homes,this possibility confirms us in our conclusion that the extension of Televisionto the provinces should be planned on the basis of the old system, althoughthe choice of system to be introduced at each stage should be governed bythe progress of research and other relevant circumstances (see paragraph 23).77. The export trade, as we have already indicated, may not developvery quickly: it will depend to a great extent on the popularity and successattained by Television in this country. On a long view, however, there are considerable potentialities in the markets abroad.78. Our general conclusions are that Television has come to stay; thatit has already reached a stage that gives satisfactory results in the home-;
that the time lost during the concentration of our resources on the war effortcan be overtaken; and that British science, engineering and industry,working in co-operation with the British Broadcasting Corporation on thelines we suggest, can be trusted in due course to produce an improvedsystem of which the nation can be proud.SUMMARY OF  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS79. Our principal conclusions and recommendations are summarised below:  Organisation(1) The Minister responsible to Parliament for sound broadcasting shouldalso be responsible for Television.   (Paragraph 11.)(2) The British Broadcasting Corporation should operate the television service.   (Paragraph 12.)(3) An Advisory Committee should again be appointed.   (Paragraph 13.)(The proposed constitution and functions of the Committee are givenin paragraph 62.)Provision and Development of ServiceMe-establishment of pre-war Television Service in London(4) The opening of the television service after the war should not be deferred for the uncertain period required to give an opportunity of incor-porating some fundamental improvement in the system, and accordingly the television service should be restarted in London on the basis of thesystem in operation before the war (405-line definition) which had achieved-a high degree of reliability and afforded consistently good entertainmentvalue in the home.   (Paragraphs 16 and 17.1Extension to Provinces(5) Plans should be made for extension of Television to possibly six of the most populous provincial centres as soon as possible after the reinstatement of the service in London. These plans should be on the basisof the 405-line system, but the scope of extension on that system shouldbe kept under review by the Advisory Committee in the light of the general conditions prevailing at each stage including progress made in the develop-ment of a new system.   (Paragraphs 23 and 28 (a).)(6) Studio programmes should be relayed by the provincial stationsfrom the main programme centre in London.   (Paragraph 28 (6).)Improved New Service(7) The aim should be to produce an improved television system having a standard of definition approaching that of the cinema, and possiblyincorporating colour and stereoscopic effects. Vigorous research on sucha system should begin immediately staff can- be made available, and allfirms capable of producing a complete system should be eligible to compete.The adopted system should not embody any patented devices which mightbe prejudicial to the general interests of British manufacturers. (Paragraphs24 to 26 and 29 (6).)
Release of Staff and Materials(8) It is important in view of the time lost in television development duringthe war that the necessary staff and materials should be released immediatelythey are required.   (Paragraph 30.)Cinema Television(9) Whilst there is general agreement that Television is destined toplay an important part in the field of public entertainment, large screenreproduction of television programmes is not likely to be generally acceptableuntil the standard of definition approaches that of the cinema. collaboration between the cinema industry and the British Broadcasting Corporation in the exploitation of Television should lead to mutually beneficial results, althoughthe public showing of television programmes will give rise to problems in connexion with performers&apos; rights which will need close attention by theAdvisory Committee.   (Paragraphs 31 to 37.)Electrical Interference(10) The Postmaster-General should be granted the necessary powers toenforce suppression of electrical interference.   (Paragraph 39.)Research(11) The considerable amount of research which will be necessary before a radically improved television service can be produced calls for the closestco-operation between all the interests concerned. Research should become-ordinated under Government auspices, great care being taken to avoidstifling or hampering initiative and competition: the task should be entrusted to the Advisory Committee.   (Paragraphs 42 and 43.)Patents(12) The main manufacturing firms should be encouraged to pool theirtelevision patents with a view to ensuring that such patents are madeavailable for use as the national interest may demand.   (Paragraph 51.)Export Market(13) The successful development of Television at home is of prime importance to the development of an export trade.    (Paragraph 57 (a).)(14) While the industry itself must be responsible for the developmentof the export trade and should keep a close-watch on the possibilities and prospects, it should keep in close touch with the Advisory Committee asthe normal channel for communication with the appropriate Minister.(Paragraph 57 (b).)(15) The Advisory Committee should keep the Government advisedof developments in the television system so that these might be broughtto the notice of Dominion and foreign Governments.    (Paragraph 57 (c).)(16) Every opportunity should be taken to include exhibits illustratingBritish television in overseas exhibitions in which the British Governmentparticipates.   (Paragraph 57 (d).)International Standardisation(17) Whilst the standards of the immediate post-war British televisionsystem should not be changed to bring them into conformity with&apos; thepresent American system (525-line definition), the desirability of adopting
common international standards should be kept constantly in mind, andas a first step the earliest opportunity should be taken ot reaching inter-national agreement on the bands of frequencies to be allocated to Television.(Paragraphs 60 and 61.)Finance(18) The arrangements for financing the television service must dependon the arrangements for financing the British Broadcasting. Corporation^sound broadcasting services after the war. The aim should be to makethe television service self-supporting as soon as possible although it will clearly not be possible to achieve this in the early stages of development.(Paragraphs 64 and 71.)(19)&quot;Special television licences should be introduced as. follows:- (a) A licence for domestic viewers at an additional fee of  1 a year.(Paragraph 68.) ......-(b) A cinema television licence the amount of the fee and the dateof its introduction to be considered later.   (Paragraph 69.)Prospects of Television(20) Extension of the service to large centres of population outside london will greatly increase the demand for receivers the price of whichshould fall when the stage of mass production is reached. The ability of television to give the viewer a front-row seat at almost every kind of excitingor memorable spectacle should ensure a success for the service in thiscountry which should eventually be reflected in the export market. (Para-&apos; graphs 74 and 77.)       .(21) Television has come to stay; it has already reached a stage thatgives satisfactory results in the home, and British science, engineering and industry, working in co-operation with the British Broadcasting Corpora-tion, can be trusted to produce an improved system of which the nationcan be proud.   (Paragraph 78.)80. We wish to place on record our deep appreciation of the assistance we have received from our Secretary, Mr. J. Varley roberts, M.C., who, withhis exceptional experience of Television and its development, has greatly facilitated our task at all stages. &apos; We owe much also to the indefatigableindustry of our Assistant Secretary, Miss C.

TELEVISION SYSTEMNature of Transinission, Power, &amp;c.The television service from Alexandra Palace involved the transmission of separate vision and sound signals from two transmitters operating on frequenciesof 45 Mc/sec. and 41-5 Mc/sec. respectively. The. vision transmitter emitted&quot;positive&quot; images (as opposed to the &quot;negative&quot; image adopted by the americans) and produced a peak radiated power of 17 kW corresponding to the picture highlights. The sound transmitter followed conventional design andradiated a power of 3 kW.The transmitters delivered power to two separate aerial systems mounted oneabove the other on the top section of a steel lattice mast supported upon the south-east tower of the Palace, giving a total height of some 606 ft. above sea-level atthe top of the mast. The vision aerial was mounted above the sound aerial andconsisted of a somewhat complex electrical structure designed to permit trans-mission of the wide frequency band involved in television pictures and at the sametime to give as nearly as possible uniform propagation of signals in all directions.The sound aerial had similar omni-directiorral radiating proper-ties hut did not, ofcourse, have to deal with the great frequency bandwidth.
The decision as to the comparative power which should be used for the visionand sound transmissions, respectively, presented a difficult problem in the firstinstance because of the totally different character of the two signals. The ratiochosen, viz., 17 kW peak vision and 3 kW sound, proved in practice to be a reason-ably satisfactory combination, although in the opinion of some observers the soundtransmission tended to lack power and hi consequence was marred by interferenceat shorter ranges than was the vision.Waves radiated from both sound and vision aerials were vertically polarised,which again was generally acceptable although certain experts expressed the viewthat horizontally polarised waves would give better results. Further experiments in this connexion will doubtless settle this point of controversy.Standards of Trans?nissionThe standards of picture transmission adopted upon the Television AdvisoryCommittee&apos;s recommendation were 405 lines, 50 frames interlaced, giving25 complete picture frames per second.Some comment on the significance of &quot;interlaced&quot; scanning would be appro-priate. In the normal process of scanning, the picture to be transmitted is dividedup into a great many lines, each of which is traversed by the scanning apparatus.In passing, the scanner records the picture detail encountered along each line andconveys intelligence thereon to the receiver, upon which the latter faithfully recon-stitutes the picture. In &quot; sequential &quot; scanning each contiguous line is exploredprogressively in turn. The process of &quot;interlaced&quot; scanning, however, consists in scanning all odd lines first, subsequently returning and scanning the even linesrequired to complete the picture &quot;frame.&quot;Although certain technical complications are introduced by this process, its use is well justified by the fact that the apparent flicker frequency of the reproducedpicture is doubled and hence the flicker rendered imperceptible without, however,materially increasing the technical difficulties of transmission by greatly increasingthe band of frequencies to. be transmitted. Hence the advantages of the methodare well established.Bange of Alexandra PalaceBefore the station was built, its effective range had been estimated at about25 miles.Experience, however, showed that reliable results were generally obtainable up. to about 35 miles and even further in exceptional cases of interference-freesituations. It was well established that in every case the limit of range was determined by the deterioration of the signal/noise ratio of the received signal.Considerable divergence of opinion existed as to whether the presence of inter-ference was more distracting upon the visual picture or upon the accompanyingbroadcast sound.Most of the interference encountered on the frequencies used for transmissionwas traceable to motor-car ignition or to electrical machinery and medicalapparatus. Strenuous representations were made through the Post Office to roadusers and users of industrial and domestic electrical equipment, and doctorsresponsible for medical apparatus, to fit suppression devices to their vehicles orplant. Although the cost of such attachments was generally trifling and their usein no way impaired the operation of the vehicles and plant, great resistance orinertia was encountered. This was, in fact, one of the most serious problemsassociated with the transmission of Television.With regard to the range of future stations, it is considered that it would be safe to assume that if transmission frequencies of the same order were employed,the use of higher powers, now technically attainable, would permit of the forecastrange of a station situated upon high ground and provided with a tall mast beingroughly a circle having a radius of 40 miles. (This is on the basis that no improve-ment in the interference. due to motor-car ignition and other well-known causescould be effected. In the event of such improvement the range would be greatlyincreased.)Scope of Television TransmissionIt can be assumed that the majority of subjects which can be successfully filmedfall within the scope of television transmission, subject to the severe limitationthat &quot; long shots &quot; in which a crowd or a number of small figures appear, or whichrely upon the reproduction of considerable detail, lose much of their effectivenessas a result of the much lower definition of the television transmission comparedwith the film.Broadly speaking, this means that small figures or objects in the background of the picture cannot be well distinguished in the ordinary receiver-size picture
of some 10&quot; x 8&quot;. Moreover, if the picture is enlarged by other means, littleimprovement is gained because of the proportionate reduction of image details.Apart from this limitation the &quot; Emitron&quot; camera, which makes use of ;ispecialised E.M.I. version of the Iconoscope of Zworykin, is admirably adapted foruse in any situation where an ordinary film camera could be used. Whereas thesensitivity of the Emitron camera and the depth of focus which could be obtainedwas somewhat less than the average film camera, a later development known asthe &quot; Super Emitron &quot; showed every promise of remedying both these deficiencies.As a result, good pictures could be produced not only in the studio with speciallyarranged production lighting, but also at outside events in comparatively poordaylight or from a theatre stage or boxing ring with only slightly augmentedillumination. The existence of the limitation imposed by the poor reproductionof &quot; long shots &quot; tended to cause the development of a rather &quot; intimate &quot; typeof production in studio work.Similarly, in outside broadcasts of topical events the producer was impelledto confine his shots, as far as possible, to close-ups of single figures, such as thebatsman at the wicket or individual tennis player, with&apos; frequent flash-backs toa long shot to give a general impression of the game as a whole. Many of the close-up pictures involved the use of telephoto lenses which were particularlysuccessful when used with the &quot; Super Emitron &quot; camera. Development of cameratechnique was progressing extremely rapidly at the time the service closed down.Alexandra Palace InstallationThe B.B.C. occupied the south-east corner of the Alexandra Palace and the installation was disposed on two floors the transmitters on the ground floor andthe studios on the first floor above. There were two complete studio units, eachfully equipped with sound and vision apparatus giving full facilities for a separateproduction in each; only one production could be transmitted at a time, of course,but the other studio could be used for full-dress rehearsal purposes with camerasand lighting.The two studios were approximately the same size, viz., 70 ft. long x 30 ft. widex 27 ft. high, and one was equipped with four cameras and the other with three;both were fully provided with specialised production lighting equipment, verymuch on the lines of a film studio. In each studio a producer&apos;s position was provided in a gallery overlooking the whole studio and at this point werecentralised all controls for fading from one camera to another and choosing theappropriate microphone or combination of microphones for the accompanying sound.In addition to the studio facilities, apparatus was installed which enabledstandard cinema film to be televised, thus permitting the inclusion in theprogramme of news-reels and any feature films required. In addition, excerptsfrom films could be introduced into a complicated &quot;live&quot; production as desired.A central control room situated between the studios was also installed which provided the facilities for selecting the desired programme originating in either of the studio units for transmission, and for introducing any programme emanating from the Outside Broadcast Unit while maintaining certain technical requirements in respect of the nature of the transmitted signal. By the use of this central control room, receivers were prevented from going out of adjustment as they might do if an abrupt change from one .studio to another or from Outside Broadcastswere made without the smooth changing facilities of the central control room.Outside Broadcast UnitTwo complete outside broadcast units were in operation, each consisting of alarge motor vehicle containing all the necessary equipment for the operation ofthree cameras and associated microphones.These vehicles could he parked at a convenient point in the vicinity of an outsideevent or at the back of a theatre and the cameras and microphones linked rip bymeans of long cables.A number of methods existed for the linking of the Outside Broadcast Unitto the Alexandra Palace where the programme was ultimately re-broadcast. First,a special television cable was installed round the centre of London with tappingpoints at numerous places of interest, such as West End theatres, the Cenotaph,main railway termini, Houses of Parliament, &amp;c, and direct transmission of television signals over this cable was carried out without difficulty.A second means of linking up to Alexandra Palace lay in a method of trans-mission of television signals over 2 or 3 miles of ordinary telephone cable whichwas in process of development immediately before the war.This represented a very considerable technical achievement, and it opened upmany possibilities of expanding the limited area covered by the special television
cable by extending it in many directions over ordinary telephone cable. Thistechnique was advancing very rapidly at the outbreak of war.A third method of linking up with Alexandra Palace was available for placeswhich lay oTitside the area covered by the special cable or a combination of thespecial cable and telephone circuits. This consisted in relaying the vision signalsdirect to Alexandra Palace for re-broadcasting by means of a mobile ultra short-wave transmitter mounted in a motor lorry. The frequency used was 64 Mc/sec.with a power of 1 kW corresponding to picture highlights.The radio signals received at Alexandra Palace were suitably filtered andamplified and re-broadcast on the main transmitter.Each Outside Broadcast Unit was complete with an ultra short-wave mobiletransmitter and also a mobile power unit capable of supplying the necessary power for the operation of the television van and the mobile link transmitter.The use of the mobile link transmitter necessitated the rapid erection of a fairly high aerial systenTat the site of the outside broadcast in order to give asatisfactory radio circuit to Alexandra Palace. To fulfil this requirement anumber of experiments were made, using, fire escape ladders as used by the fire brigade. The results of these tests were highly satisfactory as it was found that by the use of the fire escape an aerial could he erected to a height of some 100 ft.at any required point within a matter of a few minutes.A special vehicle incorporating a form of escape ladder was built for this purpose and proved very satisfactory in practice.Receiving Station at HighgateIt was found that the range of the radio link method of re-broadcasting televisionpictures was severely curtailed by the existence in the vicinity of the relativelypowerful Alexandra Palace transmitters of a field of interference which marredreception from the distant outside broadcast point. This is a common phenomenonassociated with radio transmitting stations.In consequence, it was decided to establish a receiving point at some distance from Alexandra Palace, and accordingly a site was found on very high groundat the top of Highgate Hill and a mast and aerials were erected and suitablereceivers and cable transmission apparatus installed. The received signal, afteramplification, was fed into the special television cable which passed over the top of Highgate Hill and on to Alexandra Palace. The choice of the Highgate Hillsite was, of course, largely influenced by the fact that the cable followed this route.The combination of the radio link and special cable using the Highgate sitegave very satisfactory results in practice, and many excellent broadcasts of eventssuch as tournaments, &amp;c, from the Wimbledon Tennis Club and the Boat Racefrom Watney&apos;s Brewery were carried out by means of this system.Wt. 1422 3/45 F.O.p. 29054 Gp. 340
