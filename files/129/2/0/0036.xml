Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 186.20th September, 1945.CABINET.RELEASE OF DOCTORS FROM THE ARMED FORCES.Note by the Prime Minister.IT is urgently necessary to accelerate the release of doctors from the armed forces. According to returns from the Service Departments, from mid-June (thebeginning of demobilisation) to mid-August, the release of doctors in Class A andClass B was less than 900. The present programme of the Service departments for the whole of the second half of 1945 amounts to the release of some 4,500doctors. Against this there must be set the continuing call-up of youngpractitioners (and some specialists), amounting to perhaps 500 doctors.I consider that this scale of release is inadequate. The civilian medical services have been steadily reduced during the war and the situation is nowhighly dangerous. The return of over a million men and women to civil life fromthe Armed Forces would in any case justify a big release of doctors. In addition,an appreciable degree of restoration of civilian standards must be achieved beforewinter sets in. Now that active operations have ceased all over the world, I see noreason why the Services should be unable to achieve a release of doctors well beyond the numbers proposed.An undue proportion of the gross release of 4,500 at present planned will come from the Army, where there will be an automatic reduction in the standards of establishment; nevertheless, the possibilities of further economies in the army should be explored. The proposed releases from the Royal Navy and the RoyalAir Force do not, however, appear to involve any reductions in establishments;it should be possible to secure substantial economies in these two Services by[30558]

We are no longer in a position to afford an over-all standardof medical establishment in the Services of about three doctors for every thousandyoung and healthy men and women, when the civilian population has less thanone doctor (and 0-4 of a general practitioner) per thousand men and women ofall ages. The Secretary of State for Home Affairs and the Attorney-general should examine this question as a matter of urgency. They should pay particular regard to any means of securing economies in the use of doctors in the Services,and, as well as examining conditions within each Service, they should explore the possibility of securing economies by means of inter-Service co-operation,particularly in this country.C. E. A.
