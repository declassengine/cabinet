(45) 165.10th September, 1945.CABINET.SECURITY CONDITIONS IN PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN connection with the report of the Palestine Committee (OP. (45) 156)I must draw the attention of my colleagues to the grave and threatening internal situation in Palestine. I have received a letter from the Officer Administering theGovernment, extracts from which are annexed to this memorandum, describingconditions in the territory in most sombre colours. Evidence is accumulating thaton the side both of the Arabs and of the Jews the temperature is rising andthat there is considerable danger of a violent outbreak of disturbances in the nearfuture. The High Commissioner, Lord Gort, who is at present in this country,agrees that a tense situation is developing in Palestine which may easily get out of control unless the garrison is reinforced in good time before any pronounce-ment is made by His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. The principal reason for deterioration in the situation is the fact thatthe quota of Jewish immigration under the White Paper is approachingcompletion and that expectations and anxieties have been aroused regarding thepolicy likely to be adopted by His Majesty.&apos;s Government when this point isreached. On the Zionist side emotions have been deeply stirred by the appallingsufferings of the Jewish communities in Central Europe and the wretched plight- of their survivors, while exaggerated hopes have been excited by the change ofGovernment. Extremists appear for the moment to be in control of the Zionistcamp and, particularly since the recent Zionist Conference in London, areconfidently and loudly advancing their demands for largely increased immigration and the early creation of a Jewish State in Palestine. The Arabs on their partare not unnaturally stirred and alarmed by these developments and they have notbeen reassured by what they regard as evidence of American sympathy for large-scale Jewish immigration in President Truman&apos;s statement at a recent press conference.3. There was a recrudescence of Jewish terrorism early last year, taking theform of attacks on Government buildings by the Irgun Zvai Leumi (the military organisation of the New Zionist Organisation) and cold-blooded murders by itsoff-shoot the Stern gang. In recent weeks there have been several further incidents of terrorism.4. Meanwhile, apart from the terrorist organisations, material preparations for an armed revolt by the Jewish community in Palestine are proceeding on a formidable scale. The Palmach, the storm troops of the Hagana (the illicit para-military organisation under the Jewish Agency), are estimated to number some,000 picked and full-time men, while the Hagana itself is being strengthenedand further equipped and is believed to contain about 80,000 men. The return ofdemobilised soldiers will add new trained men to its ranks. Additional evidence on this subject is contained in paragraphs 4 to 6 of the Annex.[30491] b
5. On the Arab side there is evidence of political activity on the part ofthe Arab youth and the reorganisation and training of scout groups on linesfamiliar before the disturbance of 1936.6. Forces available to deal with any disturbances consist of (a) the police force and (b) the military garrison in the country, together with reinforcementsat the immediate disposal of the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East. The BritishSection of the Palestine Police, which comprises the District Force (for normalpolice duties) and the Police Mobile Force (established with the Approval of theWar Cabinet in November 1943 to provide a highly mobile force stationed atstrategic points to deal with any civil disturbance) is at present seriously understrength.  Present establishment and strength are as follows : Establishment.    StrengthDistrict Forces     ............   3.506 2,480Police Mobile Force       .........   1,940 1,0175,446 3.497Thus the actual deficiencies in establishment are 1,949, but in addition thereare potential vacancies estimated at 640 representing the numbers of men onduration of war contracts who were unlikely to re-engage or men whose services \were compulsorily prolonged  for  the duration of  the war.     Every effort has been made, with the assistance of the military authorities and the Ministry 1of Labour and National Service, to obtain recruits to fill these vacancies, but no great success has been obtained and particularly in recent weeks, since the surrender of Japan, the number of suitable men coming forward has fallen offconsiderably.   During the present year new appointments completed numberonly 557, apart from about 150 more in varying stages of completion.7. As regards the military garrison, the forces at present available to theCommander-in-Chief, Middle East, for internal security duties are one british infantry division committed to. Palestine, one British Indian armoured division and one British Indian armoured brigade in Syria and two British India infantry brigades in Persia, Iraq. As stated in paragraph 17 of the Palestine committee report (OP. (45) 156), the Chiefs of Staff consider that, in order to meet themilitary commitments which might arise as the result of the adoption of thecourse recommended by the Committee, it would be necessary to reinforce theMiddle East garrison by two divisions and about 9,000 administrative troops.8. I have already mentioned the difficulties of recruitment for the PalestinePolice to the Secretary of State for War, who has promised to assist as far ashe can, and I trust that the War Office will make every effort to promote recruit-ment from the Army, though recent experience does not encourage hope of any considerable immediate results. In the meanwhile I suggest that the Chiefs ofStaff should be asked to take account of the information contained in this memo-randum, as regards both the unsatisfactory internal situation and the deficiencies in the establishment of the Police Force, in considering arrangements for the reinforcement of the Middle East Garrison (see paragraph 33 (c) of the PalestineCommittee Report (CP. (45) 156) ). The urgency of moving reinforcements tothe Middle East should be impressed upon all concerned.G. H. H.Colonial Office, Downing Street,10th September, 1945.
annex.Extracts from letter from the Officer Administering the Government ofPalestine (Mr. J. V. W. Shaw, C.M.G.) to the Secretary of State for theColonies, dated 24th August, 1945.I sincerely regret that, thus early in your tenure of office, I should feel itI incumbent upon me to submit to you a picture of conditions in Palestine which is: not only gloomy as to the present but depressing as to the future. It is againstI this background, however, that the whole complex of problems affecting thisI country must appear and, as there is evident a clear desire on the part of local political interests, both Jew and Arab, to force the pace towards a decision onI their aspirations, I feel that I should be failing in my duty if I did not endeavourI to paint that background. Perhaps the most important reason why this politicalj pressure is maintained and intensified is the rapidly approaching completion off I the 75,000 quota of Jewish immigrants under the White Paper and the irreconcilable-I cilability of the sharply contrasting Jewish and Arab opinion as to what should happen thereafter. I mention immigration only to stress the point that theI imminence of a decision on its future stimulates the desire of extremists on bothI sides to accelerate the making of their dispositions against any contingency.2. We have already given the Department an account of the main themesof Jewish propaganda and oratory from VE-Day to that date and invited atten-: tion to the increasing stridency and urgency perceptible in Jewish demands.I Subsequent weeks have not only brought no relaxation but. on the contrary, they&apos; have provided clear indications that Jewish terrorism, well-armed and fanatical,t is awaiting the time when an appeal to force might be considered justified byl expediency and its own ethical code. An equally disquieting feature in thei development of Palestinian politics is that the Arabs, as surely as, though moreI slowly than, the Jews, are also being worked up into the frame of mind in whichI terrorism and gang-warfare will again become political weapons. The Arabs; did not easily return to politics in a time of war-time prosperity, high prices andI full employment; but it would be a mistake to assume that the political truceI observed by the Arabs since September 1939 was ever more than temporary. TheI, truce did, however, accord with the Arab weariness of disturbances and the desirei to make the most of their economic opportunities. Indeed, only the fears and mis-\ givings created by Zionist propaganda could have so effectively turned the! thoughts of the Arabs once more to violence and racial strife.3.   To take the Jewish side first, since the Arab side of politics is primarilyf reflex action to the Jewish, Mr. Ben Gurion&apos;s statement at his press conferencein New York on the 26th June may have come to your attention, notably theI passages which read :  &quot; If the British Government really intends now to maintain and enforce the White Paper, it will have to use constant and brutal force to do so &quot; \       and&quot; To attempt to enforce the policy of the White Paper .... will create a most dangerous situation in that part of the world &quot; (i.e., the middle east).That such statements are something more than rhetorical cannot, I think,I be doubted after a perusal of speeches made at the recent Zionist conference i as reported in the local press. Thus, Dr. Aba Silver is quoted as having! declared that &quot;Jews will fight for their rights with whatever weapons are ati their disposal &quot; and to Dr. Moshe Sneh (whose position as virtual commander-: in-chief of the Hagana lends significance to his words) is attributed the state--; ment : &quot;It must be clear that Government would have to use force to imposei the White Paper on the Yishuv.&quot; The same speaker is credited with urgingI Palestine Jewry to declare that it does not consider itself bound, by any of theI provisions of the White Paper, and with stating that while &quot;we shall not  resort to terrorism, the Government will have to use violence to enforce theI White Paper regime.&quot; You will note that these utterances are directedI specifically against the (1939) White Paper and a policy based on it. ConI sidering the recent demands of the Jewish Agency for large-scale immigration&apos; and for control of the development of Palestine with the attributes, de factoI if not otherwise, of a sovereign authority, I do not think  that the Zionist[30491] b 2
leaders&apos; defiance is directed at so limited a target. The intention is to showthat the Jewish people in Palestine is capable of offering and is determined tooffer physical resistance to a policy (be it within or without the White Paper)which does not square with Jewish aspirations. I do not believe that thisoverstrains the sense of the quotations given since to the Zionist politician and,through his teachings, to the majority of Jews in Palestine, the White paper has come to represent the barrier between the Yishuv and a Jewish State.During the war years Zionist propaganda has been all black and white and now in the minds of the Yishuv there appears to be no half measure betweenthe constriction of the White Paper and the ebullience of a Jewish State. TheJewish community had thus been brought to a mental condition in which every-thing less than the formulary alternative to the White Paper will be a betrayalagainst which it is their duty to fight.4. If I am correct in believing that the Yishuv is being psychologicallyprepared for what will be in effect armed rebellion, it must be admitted thatmaterial preparations do not seem to lag behind. The strength of the Palmacli(the storm troops of the Hagana) is probably in the region of 2,000 picked and full-time men; there is little doubt that the Hagana itself is constantly-strengthening its numbers, improving its equipment and elaborating its organisation. When members of the Jewish Brigade Group return to Palestineon demobilisation, they will constitute a further and formidable addition to itsranks. That it now considers itself equal to any task to which its leadersmay assign it is to be inferred from the general tone of recent references to it by Jewish speakers. For example, Dr. Bernard Joseph, at the time of the policeoperations following the murder of British Constable Wilde (reported in my telegram No. 1013), told the acting Chief Secretary that if the police entereda Jewish settlement in the course of the operation and found illegal armsbelonging to the Hagana they7 &quot; could never go into a Jewish settlement again.&quot;To the Inspector-General, he said, that if the settlements were searched, &quot;no british policemen would in future be allowed within 1,000 yards of a Jewishsettlement.&quot; While some allowance must be made for Dr. Joseph&apos;s hystericaltemperament and taste for the theatrical, there is sufficient evidence from pastattempts to search settlements to show that violent opposition would be offered.That was never in doubt. My point is that the Jewish leaders here, in their approach to the question of illegal arming, openly challenge the authority ofGovernment and the validity7 of law.5. Jewish terrorism, whether originating from the National military organisation or the Stern Group, has been manifest in various forms sinceVE-day. The use of home-made mortars has, indeed, been discontinued sincethe discovery of six concealed near the Government printing press and theY.M.C.A. on the 12th and the 13th June, and it is possible that this disappearance of these weapons can be attributed to the successful police action in tracing twoworkshops in Tel Aviv where they were manufactured. On the 13th Julyoccurred the successful ambushing of a truck carrying a load of gelignite, fusesand detonators and the murder of a British constable escort. On the 25th july railway bridge was blown up on the Lydda-Kantara line. On the 7th Augustan armed robbery in daylight at a, bank in Tel Aviv gained LP. 3,500. On the9th August a hut and rjumping-shed in the orange grove of an Arab landownerwere burnt by armed Jews an act of reprisal unhappily reminiscent of pastdisturbances. On the 13th August a large armed gang stole 450 lbs. of gelignite,2.263 metres of fuse and 4,166 detonators from a Solel Boneh (Jewish Co-operativeContractors) explosives store near Petah Tiqva. On the 20th August a Jewwho had provided the police with valuable information was murdered.6. These terrorist activities have accompanied an openly proclaimed periodof preparation for a final trial of strength. There has been a steady flow ofpamphlet propaganda reinforced by a broadcast from a secret wireless trans-mitter on the 21st July; one pamphlet distributed by the National military organisation offered His Majesty&apos;s Government a short respite to see fulfilledthe Zionist programme. A somewhat similar pamphlet issued by the Stern Groupappeared at the same time. Both terrorist organisations have shown everyintention of proceeding energetically7 with para-military training and the accumu-lation of weapons. On the 16th August the police captured&quot; the personnel ofan entire National Military Organisation training course together with a liberalsupply of arms and explosives.
In a recent interview with a police officer of the C.I.D. a representative of the  Jewish Agency said that &apos;&apos; he wished to make it clear that the Agency wasnot co-operating with us (the Government) to exterminate the terrorists&quot;(/.(?., that the Agency&apos;s interest was to suppress terrorism but not to immunisethe terrorists. This can only imply that the Jewish Agency envisages a timewhen the existence of these two organisations may be useful to Zionist policyand when they may be required to act as allies of the Hagana in a commoncampaign against the Government.7. On the Arab side the party leaders are continuing their manoeuvres; butthe publicity given to the Palestine problem, the Zionist Conference and theJewish interpretation of President Truman&apos;s recent statement have here againintroduced a new note of urgency. The lack of unity now does not justify anyassumption that under Zionist pressure general agreement on action against jews and land-brokers could not be achieved. On the broader issues, i.e.t on all thatmight imply Zionist domination, Arab disunity is not fundamental.One indication that among the Arabs, too, extremism is gaining ground isafforded by the Jack of success of Musa el Alami in his political schemes.Musa Eff., after some initial success as representative of the Palestine Arabs atthe earlier meetings in connection with the establishment of the Arab League,is now thoroughly depressed both by the personal rivalries by which he issurrounded and by the apparent success of the &quot; old gang &quot; of politicians centredon the Sanduq al Ummeh, Ahmed Hilmi Pasha, Auni Bey Abdul Hadi and dr. Hussein Khaladi/in winning support for their own schemes both in cairo and Baghdad. Musa Eff., himself is not entirely free from blame for this stateof affairs since he has shown a sensitiveness, nervousness and lack of backbonewhich have seriously handicapped him in the rough and tumble of Arab politics.Whatever the cause, there is reason to believe that both Abdul Rahman AzzamBey (the Egyptian Minister for Arab Affairs and Secretary-General of the arab league) and Hamdi Pasha Pachachi, the Prime Minister of Iraq, are inclined to support Ahmed Hilmi Pasha and his colleagues of the Sanduq al Ummeh(originally a fund for the purpose of buying lands which might be sold to Jews).Furthermore there has been a report, at present unconfirmed, that these men arecontemplating turning to Izzat Darwazeh, that extreme and unscrupulous evilgenius of Haj Amin al Husseini who is now in exile in Turkey. Izzat Darwazeh&apos;sinfluence will almost certainly be exerted towards terrorism and a recrudescenceof gang warfare. It is also of significance, as an indication of the possible trend of Arab policy, that whereas Haj Amin built-up his power and his terroristorganisation through the large Awqaf revenues which he controlled, the funds of the Sanduq al Ummeh could, and might well be, utilised for a similar purpose.Musa Eff. al Alami has indeed suggested that some&apos; such terrorist organisation is already in being, and although there is as yet no proof of this it is a possibilityagainst which we must be on our guard in view of the sharp increase in thestridency of racial politics. During February and March the sudden appearance of luridly phrased pamphlets against land-brokers, and the murder of a brokerin Jaffa, were ominous shadows of past events and indications of the future. It-is relevant here to mention that in spite of the lack of unified Arab leadershipthere is an increasing political activity among the educated Arab youth and inthe towns which inevitably calls to mind similar activity before the disturbancesof 1936. There has been a marked revival of society and club activities, the unionof various small associations, and attempts, so far unsuccessful, to form &quot; Arabfronts &quot; in Haifa and Jaffa. Even more significant, in the light of past history,has been the reorganisation and training of scout groups throughout the country;similar groups were used in 1936 as, or in support of, armed, gangs.8. Arab political activity, as has been said above, has largely been thereflex action of Jewish activity. By September 1939 the mass of the arab population had had enough of the depredations of the armed gangs and themilitary counter-measures, and had settled down to make the most of the economicopportunities provided by the war. They Avere aroused from their indifferenceto politics by the publicity given to Jewish land settlement (which led to the foundation of the Sanduq al Ummeh) and by the reiterated maximalist demandsof the Jewish leaders which brought the Arab politicians into transitory agree-ment in 1944 on the nomination of Musa Effendi el Alami as their all-Partyrepresentative at the Arab Unity discussions. After the defeat of Germany Arabpolitical activity from VE-Day onwards has increased rapidly in the wake of jewish political harangues which proclaimed that the time&apos; for the Zionistsolution of the Palestine problem was at hand.   The fellah in are still disposed
to stand aloof from the political scene; but even they hold fast to Haj Amin asthe symbol of Arab opposition to the influx of an alien race and culture. Fearof the alien, religious intolerance and, among the educated youth, the delayedaction of Arab nationalism which has been developing since its rebirth in 1910,have contributed to an atmosphere in which political intransigence flourishesand the seeds of future terrorism germinate readily. The prominence given inthe Jewish press to the Zionist Conference in London and the speculation onthe meaning of President Truman&apos;s recent statement on Palestine have furtherstimulated Arab apprehensions and made easier the task of their political leaders and agitators.The Arabs are more inclined to turn, not to Musa Effendi el Alami and hismore far-sighted schemes for land development, but to the Sanduq al TJmmeh,which, with all its faults, is accepted as a practical means of combatting Jewishexpansion : hence the increasing influence of Ahmed Hilmi Pasha and hiscolleagues and the greater possibility that Arab terrorism will be revived as apolitical weapon.9. The picture is a sombre one. The young Jewish extremists, the product of a vicious education system, know neither toleration nor compromise; they regard themselves -as morally justified in violence directed against any individual orinstitution that impedes the complete fulfilment of their demands. In a similarspirit their ancestors in the second century b.c. laid waste Palestine until aravaged countryside and ruined cities marked the zenith of Hasmonaean power.The protoypes of the Stern Group and National Military Organisation are theZealots and Assassins according to whose creed even Jews married to Gentileswere worthy of death in Roman times. These Zealots of to-day, from Poland,Russia and the Balkans have yet to learn toleration and recognition of the rightsof others. As the Foreign Secretary said recently of the Balkans, these peopledo not understand what we understand by the meaning of the word democracy.The Jewish Agency may deplore terrorism; but every immoderate speech, such asthose quoted at the beginning of this letter, the flagrant disregard on the one hand for the authority of Government in maintaining law and order and on the other for the Arab case, the chauvinism and intolerance of their educational system,all contribute to an atmosphere in which the fanatic and the terrorist flourish.The Jewish leaders appear to be deliberately pushing extremism to a point when an explosion can no longer be avoided and do not scruple to use the plight ofthe Jews in Europe as a main political excuse. There are many Jews who deplorethis state of affairs, but the rigidity of the discipline imposed by the politicalmachine effectively discourages criticism except where it has no practical effecton Zionist policy. The Jews, like so much in Europe, need education in tolerationand democracy.10. On the other side are the Arabs, for the most part backward and lesspolitically alive. As far as Palestine is concerned there is probably nothingthat has contributed so much to the growth of a sense of Arab nationalismas has the pressure of Zionism. Their political leadership may still beinept. Their daily life may still be hampered by medievalism and marredby ignorance and religious bias. But even in their poverty and ignorance(and in both respects their condition is improving) they will fight stubbornly whenroused, above all when roused by threats against their land, customs and religion.I cannot too forcibly emphasise the strength of the personal feeling of the fellahfor his land and the intensity of his fear (as in the case of all peasants) that hemay be dispossessed. Even Ibrahim Pasha at the height of his power in 1834found the fellahin of the hill country hard to subdue, as did British troops in1936-39. With centuries of tribal raiding and the blood-feud behind them tilemass of the Palestinian Arabs are still capable of resisting, savagely andtenaciously, what they may consider as an attempt to reduce them to a minoritystatus in a land which they regard as theirs. And unfortunately, after the trucewhich has prevailed since 1939, Jewish speeches, publicity and terrorism are fastpersuading them that they must retain their present position by force.* *****
