(45) 156.8th September, 1945.CABINET.PALESTINE COMMITTEE.Report by the Lord President of the Council.Appointment, Terms of Reference and Constitution of the Committee.1. On the 22nd August, 1945, the Prime Minister appointed a ministerial committee on Palestine with the following membership : The Lord President of the Council (Chairman).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Secretary of State for India and for Burma.The Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Secretary of State for War.The Secretary of State for Air.The Committee was required, by its terms of reference, to consider and reportto the Cabinet on policy for Palestine.I now submit, for the consideration of my colleagues, an ad interimreport of the conclusions reached by the Palestine Committee as to the course which should be pursued in Palestine between the date on which the immigra-tion quota prescribed in the White Paper will be exhausted and that on whicha new long-term policy can be promulgated.The Present Position in Palestine.2. The Mandate for Palestine requires Great Britain as Mandatory tofacilitate Jewish immigration and to encourage close settlement by Jews on theland, while ensuring that the rights and position of other sections of thepopulation are not prejudiced thereby. There is thus a dual obligation, to theJews on the one side and to the Arabs on the other, the lack of a clearer definition of which has been the cause of most of the troubles of the past. The latest State-ment of Policy is that contained in the White Paper of May 1939. In this statement, provision was made for the continuance of Jewish immigration fora period of five years, after which no further immigration was to be permittedunless the Arabs of Palestine were prepared to acquiesce in it. It was statedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government were satisfied that, when the immigration over five years then contemplated had taken place, they would not be justified in facilitating, nor would they be under any obligation to facilitate, the further development of the Jewish National Home by immigration regardless of thewishes of the Arab population.[30488] b
3. Under the terms of the White Paper, 75,000 Jewish immigrants wereto be admitted to Palestine during the five years following its publication. Thisperiod ended last year but, owing to conditions arising out of the war in Europe,the number of immigrants admitted fell short of the prescribed quota. Theperiod was therefore extended so as to run until the quota was filled; it is nowanticipated that the full number of 75,000 immigrants will have reachedPalestine before the end of this year.4. The Committee thus finds itself confronted with a double task. We areat one in holding that the White Paper policy cannot be indefinitely maintained and that it is necessary for his Majesty&apos;s Government to decide upon a newlong-term policy to be adopted in its place. But a period, which it is hoped maynot exceed six months, must necessarily elapse before such a new policy can be formulated, worked out in all its details and implemented, especially if procedure under the new international trusteeship system set up at San Francisco is deemedto be either necessary or desirable. During this period, the immigration quotaprescribed in the White Paper will be exhausted and a decision is required asto the course which His Majesty&apos;s Government shall pursue between the date ofsuch exhaustion and that on which the new long-term policy will be promulgated.5. There are about 3,000 immigration certificates remaining from the white paper quota and, unless immigration is to cease at the end of October for want of advance planning, these should now be allocated. The question of short-term policy is thus an urgent one and I am therefore submitting this ad interimreport in order to enable an immediate decision in the matter to.be reached.The problem of long-term policy will be dealt with subsequently in a separate report.Summary of Recommendation.6. The Committee recommends that His Majesty&apos;s Government should, inrespect of the immigration to be permitted during the interval between the exhaustion of the White Paper quota and the promulgation of a new long-term policy, continue to conform to the existing arrangements as prescribed in theWhite Paper. Under those arrangements, no further Jewish immigration willbe admissible during this interval unless Arab acquiescence in it can be obtained.Every effort must, of course, be made to secure such acquiescence. The reasons which have actuated us in arriving at this conclusion are explained in the subsequent paragraphs of this report.Nature of the Short-Term Expedient.7. It seems clear that there can be no question of permitting, during the interval referred to in the preceding paragraph, the mass immigration for whichthe Zionist Organisations are now pressing; whether or not such massimmigration should be allowed in future is a matter for examination in connectionwith the formulation of a long-term plan. The most that could reasonably becontemplated without prejudicing long-term policy in advance would be atemporary continuance of immigration at approximately the rate now permissible,namely, about 1,500 immigrants a month; that would be an extension of the 75,000maximum contemplated by the White Paper.8. The number of immigrants which could, in any case, be admitted duringthe transitional period would thus be comparatively small. Indeed, thecontinuance of immigration during this period is of more importance whenviewed as a measure designed to appease Jewish sentiment in the matter thanwhen viewed as a genuine contribution to the solution of the real problem of world Jewry.Courses Now Open to His Majesty&apos;s Government.9. Two courses are open to His Majesty&apos;s Government for adoption duringthe interval between the exhaustion of the White Paper quota and tine announce-ment of a new long-term policy.   These are : (a) To continue to conform temporarily to the White Paper policy and,after the exhaustion of the White Paper quota, to permit no furtherJewish immigration unless Arab acquiescence can be obtained.(b) To continue to permit Jewish immigration after the exhaustion of theWhite Paper quota, the Arabs being consulted in the matter altjhoughHis Majesty&apos;s Government have already reached their decision on thequestion.
It may be mentioned that the White Paper refers specifically to the aquiescence of the Arabs of Palestine. In actual fact, however, it will be theArab States which will have the prevailing voice. The question is bound to bereferred to the Arab League, on which the Palestinian Arabs are represented,and the latter would be most unlikely to stand out against any decision arrivedat by the States.10. We rule out the possible alternative of continuing immigration without consultation with the Arabs. Mr. Churchill, President Roosevelt and president truman have all given assurances to various Arab Rulers that they will be con-suited before any change is made in the basic situation in Palestine. Moreover,the Viceroy and the majority of His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in the middle east take the view that more serious reactions would be evoked by failure to consult than by consultation, even if unsuccessful.11. In June last, an enquiry was made from the Viceroy, His Majesty&apos;representatives in Washington and in the Middle East and the High Commis-sioner for Palestine as to the reception likely to be accorded to the two alternative courses mentioned in paragraph 9 above by the Governments and peoples of thecountries with which each was concerned. The Chiefs of Staff were askedsimultaneously to make an appreciation of the military commitments involved.In arriving at our conclusions, we have given due weight to the views expressedby these authorities.Maintenance of the White Paper Policy.12. His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in the Arab States have made it clearthat adherence to the White. Paper is the only policy which the States wouldview with approval. This would involve seeking their acquiescence in continuedimmigration, but leaving the final decision to them. His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Baghdad believes that, if an approach were made on these lines, the iraqi government, for their part, would be prepared to agree to a continuance of immi-gration at the present rate, while the Minister at Jedda considers that KingIbn Saud would not oppose and would almost certainly counsel acquiescence bythe Arabs of Palestine in some measure of continued immigration. Egyptianconsent is not anticipated by the Ambassador in Cairo, but Lord Altrincham,as Minister Resident in the Middle East, took the view that the question wouldbe referred to the Arab League and that Egypt would not stand out againstacquiescence if it were favoured by the other members, particularly Iraq andSaudi Arabia. Nor did he think that the Palestinian Arabs, even if they refusedformally to acquiesce, would cause trouble if they knew that they would receiveno sympathy from the Arab States.13. In the wider sphere, the Viceroy holds the maintenance of the white paper policy to be the only one which would prevent criticism and agitation inIndia. The Ambassador in Washington considers that adherence to the white paper if, but only if, accompanied by further Jewish immigration with Arabconsent, could be accepted without too much difficulty by American opinion.14. Adherence to the undertaking given in the White Paper would havethe advantage that it would involve no revision of policy during the criticalinterval between November and the date of the promulgation of a new long-term plan. Should His Majesty&apos;s Government decide to adopt this course, one of twosituations may arise, according to whether the Arabs acquiesce, or refuse to acquiesce, in continued immigration. If they acquiesce, as there seems to be afair prospect of their doing, it is just possible that we may be able to tide over this critical interval without adverse repercussions on our international relations.The Zionists, who have always denied the right of the Arabs to any voice in the determination of the scale of Jewish immigration, would, of course, protest-vehemently against the maintenance of the White Paper, however provisionally,but the de facto continuance of immigration might have the effect of deprivingthem of an adequate pretext for a resort to organised violence.15. There would, however, be a risk of more serious trouble with the Jews.A recrudescence of terrorist activities might necessitate the taking of steps which might rouse the community as a whole and attempts to defeat the policy by resort to illegal immigration might lead to clashes not only between jews and the police but between Jews and Arabs.   Should disorders due to such[30488] \ b 2
causes occur and have to be repressed by force, reactions in America wouldprobably be grave. The Ambassador in Washington has given warning that,should any decision be followed by disorder which required the use of Britishtroops and involved the killing of Jews, public opinion in the United States might become violently inflamed against His Majesty&apos;s Government.16. The other situation which must be contemplated would arise if the attempt to secure acquiescence failed; His Majesty&apos;s Government would then,under the terms of the White Paper in accordance with which acquiescencehad been sought, be bound to accept the Arab decision and to put a temporarystop to Jewish immigration. In that event, the Jews would almost inevitablyresort to violence either immediately or as a consequence of attempts to stopillicit immigration, with the danger of repercussions in the United States ofthe nature already mentioned.17. The Chiefs of Staff consider that, in order to meet any military commitments which may arise under this course, it will be necessary to reinforce the Middle East garrison by two divisions and about 9,000 administrative troops.This could, they state, be done before the end of 1945.18. The relative advantages and disadvantages of this course can be brieflyassessed as follows :A advantages.(1) It necessitates no change of policy pending the announcement of a newlong-term plan.(2) It may succeed in enabling us to tide over the interval until such a plancan be announced without adverse repercussions on our international relations.(3) It will assure to us the continued friendship of the Arab States.(4) It will be welcomed in India at a time when it is very important tore-establish belief in the good faith of the pledges of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.(5) It involves the smallest military commitment, and one which can be met at reasonably short notice.Disadvantages.- (1) Even if the Arabs acquiesce in continued immigration there is a possi-bility of trouble with the Jews which may lead to incidents liable to cause serious reactions in the United States.(2)  If the Arabs refuse to acquiesce in continued immigration, such trouble,incidents and reactions are almost inevitable.Contimiance of Immigration tvithout Arab Consent.19. The alternative course would be for His Majesty&apos;is Government todecide that Jewish immigation should continue at the present rate and to consult the Arabs without relating the consultation to the provisions of the White paper or being prepared to modify their policy in the event of Arab refusal to endorseit. The probability of obtaining Arab acquiescence on such terms appears small;the Arabs cling to the White Paper and, if His Majesty&apos;s Government are notprepared to conform to that policy, they are hardly likely to be prepared to go outof their way to assist in relieving the resulting embarrassment. Of the Repre-sentatives in the Arab States, only His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Baghdad takes the view that this course might be successful, but he clearly assumes that agree-ment with the Iraqi Government would in fact be reached and that the unrealityof the negotiations would not be revealed.20. The other Representatives point out the dangers involved in the pro-posal. Extreme irritation would be caused in Egypt if its opinion were askedand then disregarded. An approach to the Levant States, after the decision ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government had already been taken, would not be likely to secure agreement and would, indeed, be hailed as a mockery. While King Ibn Saudwould be more reasonable than most Arab leaders if asked to acquiesce in furtherJewish immigration in accordance with the White Paper process, he wouldinterpret any departure from that process as a breach of faith and as a personalbetrayal.   The consent of the Arabs of Palestine would almost certainly not be
forthcoming, nor would the Arab States be prepared to put pressure upon them fogive such consent.21. The Viceroy states that any solution of the Palestine problem whichcould be interpreted as injurious to the interests of the Arabs and a breach of the pledges given by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the White Paper would be likelyto cause serious unrest in the Punjab and would affect recruiting for the army.There would also immediately be excitement among the Frontier Muslims.Agitation would not be confined to the Muslims; the Congress would undoubtedlytake the opportunity of proving that they represent not only Hindu butMuslim interests, and would be likely to foment and take part in the agitation.A dangerous situation might thus arise.22. As regards repercussions in the Middle East in the event of the Stateshaving to be overruled, political parties and their press in Egypt might well makecapital out of the issue and disorders might result. There would be activeopposition in the Levant States and the local Governments might be unable, evenif disposed, to prevent anti-British demonstrations and incursions to assist theArabs of Palestine. Iraq would hold Great Britain guilty of a breach of faith.King Ibn Saud might cease to use his influence to check action by the Arab Leaguelikely to embarrass His Majesty&apos;s Government and shut his eyes to tribal raiding.It is worthy of note that this year&apos;s Pilgrimage falls due in mid-November, so thatMuslims from all over the Near and Middle East, and from India, will be con-gregated in Mecca at about-the time when His Majesty&apos;s Governments decisiontakes effect. An anti-British demonstration in this setting would have widespreadconsequences.23. The possibility of an Arab revolt in Palestine would also have to be reckoned with. It seems that the effect on public opinion in the United Statesof the results likely to arise out of the adoption of this course would be almost as unfavourable as those arising out of one which involved a Jewish revolt. the ambassador in Washington writes that any decision by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment which was followed by disorder and involved British troops firing on Arabswould, whatever the chain of events that led up to it, be likely to evoke strong-criticism of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Such criticism might be somewhat lessstrident than would accompany firing on Jews, but would certainly be damagingand might become formidable. Our stand against the French in the Levantwould inevitably be held up against us, and the prospects of American sympathyor support for British requests for facilities in Egypt or elsewhere for the defenceof the Suez Canal would be greatly prejudiced.24. It is, moreover, certain that even an ex parte decision by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that immigration should continue at the Current rate would fail tosatisfy Zionist opinion. The Jewish Agency has already declared its inability,now that the war is over, to accept the present limitation of immigration to1,500 immigrants a month. The risk of trouble with the Jews under this coursewould, therefore, be much the same as that foreseen if Arab acquiescence is firstsought and obtained, with the same danger of adverse repercussions in the UnitedStates.25. The Chiefs of Staff consider that, in order to meet the military commit-ments which might arise as the result of the adoption of this course, it wouldbe necessary to reinforce the Middle East garrison by some three to four-Divisions and about 9,000 administrative troops. Some reinforcement by Britishtroops might also be required in Indira. If, moreover, the present ruling were maintained that Indian troops shall not be used in circumstances where they may find themselves in conflict with Muslim populations, an additional commitment of nearly two British Divisions (to replace Indian troops now in Syria and iraq) would be involved. The Chiefs of Staff state that the necessary forces could not, on present plans for South and South-East Europe, be provided beforethe spring of 1946.26. The relative advantages and disadvantages of this course can be assessed as follows  &apos;A advantages. (1) It would at least tend to appease Zionist sentiment in this country, inthe United States and in Palestine.(2) It would finally dispose of the White Paper, the unpopularity of which,in other than Arab circles, is general.
k6Disadvantages.(1) It would necessitate the repudiation of the undertaking given in 1939in advance of a new pronouncement on long-term policy.(2) It would result in a wave of hostility against Great Britain throughoutthe Middle East.(3) It would be likely to give rise to trouble in India.(4) It would be likely to give rise to disturbances among the Arabs inPalestine, which might cause serious reactions in the United States.(5) It would fail fully to appease the Zionists and might give rise to trouble with the Jews in Palestine, again causing serious reactions in &quot;theUnited States.(6) It would involve a heavy military commitment which could not be metbefore next spring without much derangement of existing plans.Great Britain&apos;s Position in the Middle East.27. The attitude of the Arab States to any decision which may be reachedis a matter of the first importance. The Middle East is a region of vitalconsequence for Britain and the British Empire. It forms the nodal point inthe system of communications, by land, sea and air, which links Great britain with India, Australia and the Far East; it is also the Empire&apos;s main reservoirof mineral oil. It contains the area of the Suez Canal and its terminal ports;our main naval base in the Eastern Mediterranean at Alexandria; the oilfieldsin Iraq and Southern Persia, the port and installations at Abadan, the pipe-line from Northern Iraq to Haifa and the port and installations at Haifa itself; andthe whole line of communications by land and air running from the Mediterraneansea-board through Palestine, Trans-Jordan and Iraq to the Persian Gulf.. 28. In spite of the importance of the Middle East to the Empire, the island of Cyprus is the only territory in the region over which we hold full sovereignty.Palestine is a mandated territory, and its future is subject in some considerable measure to international agreement. All the other Middle Eastern countries areindependent States except Trans-Jordan, whose independence will very&apos; soon be equally complete. Protection of our vital interests depends, therefore, uponthe collaboration which we can obtain from these independent States.29. At present, our prestige in the Middle East stands immensely highand our relations with the Rulers of the various States are friendly and cordial.But Arab sentiment is notoriously changeable, and any action by Great Britainwhich the Arabs deemed injurious to their interests might transform it almostovernight. Unfortunately, the future of Palestine bulks large in all Arab eyesand is a subject of deep moment to the Arab League, the formation of which hasgreatly increased both the power and will of the individual States to resist the implementation in the Middle East of policies to which they object. Toenforce any such policy, and especially one which lays us open to a charge ofbreach of faith, is bound seriously to undermine our position and may well leadnot only to widespread disturbances in the Arab countries but to the withdrawalof the co-operation on which our Imperial interests so largely depend.Recommendation.30. Having in view the importance of these interests and the relativeadvantages and disadvantages of the two courses, as sketched in paragraphs 18and 26, we consider that the balance of advantage lies in the temporary main-tenance of the White Paper policy. Both courses are fraught with danger, andwe have, in effect, to choose between the possibility, of-localised trouble with theJews in Palestine and the virtual certainty of widespread disturbance amongthe Arabs throughout the Middle East and possibly among the Muslims in India.In terms of force the latter represents a military commitment twice or three times as great as does the former. If we adhere to the White Paper we may escapewithout adverse repercussions; there is no hope of doing so under the alternative course. From the point of view of our relations with the United States, weshall be subjected to criticism, should trouble break out, whether such trouble is with the Arabs or with the Jews.31. If and when the time comes to place Palestine under Trusteeship, it willbe necessary, under the Charter of the United Nations, to conclude a Trusteeship
721Agreement to be agreed upon by the States directly concerned and to be approvedby the General Assembly. This procedure will apply even if no change in theprovisions of the present Mandate is involved and our policy in Palestine is thusalmost bound in due course to be the subject of international discussion. Therewould therefore be advantage in making our proposals for a new long-term policysimultaneously with our proposals for a Trusteeship Agreement to replace theMandate. It is not suggested that we should refer our short-term policy to theWorld Organisation (no organ has, indeed, yet been established which wouldbe competent to deal with it) but it will be desirable to inform the Governmentof the United States in advance of the action which we propose to take in thematter. . .32. The Committee has every sympathy with the plight of the Jews inEurope and every desire to further the success of the National Home in palestine and, in framing a new long-term policy, it will have these objects prominentlybefore it. But no immigration which could be considered during the purely temporary period until such a policy can be formulated would make any sub-stantial contribution to the solution of the real problem. The immediate task which confronts us is to devise a purely stop-gap arrangement which will enable us to tide over this period with a minimum of disturbance.33.   The Committee therefore recommends : -(a) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should continue to conform to the exist-ing arrangements as prescribed in the White Paper in respect of immigration during the interval between the exhaustion of the quotatherein prescribed and the promulgation of a new long-term policy,every effort being made to persuade the Arabs to agree to a continua-tion of immigration during this interval at the rate at presentpermissible.(b) That, before-eEhe approach is made to the Arabs, the Government of theUnited States should be informed of the position, of the fact thatthe formulation of a new long-term policy for Palestine is under the urgent consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government, that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment intend to refer the long-term policy to the World Organi-sation in due course, and that they propose, in the meantime, to actas at (a).(c) That the Chiefs of Staff should be asked to take immediate steps to reinforce the Middle East garrison to the extent necessary to meetthe military commitment involved in (a).H.
