(45) 161.8th September, 1945.CABINET.PROVISIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR  THE  POST-WAR armed forces.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretaries ofState for War and Air.THE accelerated process of demobilisation has brought the Services faceto face with the urgent problem of retaining on regular engagements a sufficient number of officers and other ranks particularly experienced N.C.O.S to manthe post-war Navy, Army and Air Force on a permanent basis.2. At present, appointments to permanent commissions, the grant of sub-substantive promotion to officers and N.C.O.S, and offers of re-engagement are limited in all three Services to the 1939 peace establishment.3. It is clear that decisions cannot yet be taken on the strength and composi-tion of the sea, land and air forces which are to be maintained permanently inpeace. But time is pressing and the Services must be given interim decisions asa basis for immediate action. Officers and men of first-rate quality are dailyaccepting release because they can be told nothing definite about their post-warprospects in the Services. This is a matter of special difficulty in new brancheswhich have been formed since the war and in which the numbers of permanentofficers and men are negligible. Unless provisional decisions can be given on post-war strengths and conditions of service, the Services may be faced at novery distant date with the necessity of offering special terms, even includingbounties, to induce men to remain.4. The Principal Personnel Officers of the Services have accordinglyreviewed the position and have submitted the annexed report giving an estimateof provisional requirements to serve as a basis for immediate action. their recommendations have been endorsed by the Chiefs of Staff (C.O.S. Conclusionsof 186th Meeting (a) Item 16).5. We therefore ask the approval of the Cabinet for the following pro-visional figures for the three Services, without prejudice to the ultimate strengthand composition of the Services which can only be determined when post-warstrategical requirements have been decided : Navy ............       ...       170,000Army ...............      275,000R.A.F................      200,0006.   These figures are founded upon different bases for each Service : (a) For the Royal Navy they represent the estimated minimum post-warrequirement of long-service officers and ratings, and presuppose thata substantial part of the burden of providing for the Naval Defenceof the Empire will be undertaken by the Dominions and Colonies.In the event of compulsory national service being retained, anadditional 10,000 will be required to provide the necessary administra-tive services and training facilities.[30492] b
(b) The Army hope to obtain some productive service out of their nationalservice trainees, and the Army figure represents the minimum regularcomponent of an active Army of 430,000, made up of national service personnel as well as regulars. This figure of 430,000 is, of course,considerably less than the requirements of the Army during the periodof occupation of ex-enemy territories. It is also probable that it willbe quite insufficient to meet our strategical commitments even after astate of world stability has been reached.(c) The R.A.F. figure is no more than an instalment to enable the AirMinistry to increase the number of permanent commissions to be awarded and to permit of the substantive promotion of a number ofacting warrant and non-commissioned officers who would not other-wise re-engage. The figure is in excess of the pre-war strength of theR.A.F., but is much below what the Air Council consider will be essential to meet post-war commitments.7. The question of conditions of service is closely allied with that of numbers, and it is of the utmost importance that we should be in a position topromulgate firm conditions of service in the post-war Forces at the earliestpossible moment. A review of Service pay and pensions is now being carriedout by an Interdepartmental Committee under Treasury auspices, whose recom-mendations are expected before the end of the year. The Service departments will have to have their plans cut and dried before then so that the incentiveanticipated from the announcement of the new pay code may not be lost; forthis purpose, they must know the numbers within which recruitment on regularengagements can proceed. The plans involve a great deal of complex calculationand an early decision on the provisional figures is essential.8. We therefore ask the Cabinet to approve the figures given in paragraph5 above as a basis for immediate action, on the understanding that the ultimatesize of the three Services would remain to be determined.A. V. A.J. J. L.S.    .8th September, 1945.ANNEX.*Provisional Personnel Requirements for Post-war Forces.Introduction.1. At their 146th (45) meeting on the 7th June, 1945, the Chiefs of Staffgave consideration to three papers put forward respectively by the Admiralty,War Office and Air Ministry in which each had sought to give an estimate of its immediate requirements in post-war Regular personnel with a view (withoutprejudice to any ultimate decisions about our strategic requirement and the consequent strength of our armed forces as a whole and of their componentservices) to providing figures up to which each Service might be permitted to recruit personnel on a provisional basis, so that irreplaceable trained men now inthe Services, who might be attracted to remain, would not be lost to the Servicesthrough uncertainty over their prospects. The earliest of these papers(C.O.S. (45) 321 (O)) had been circulated by the Chief of Air Staff on the8th May and asked the Chiefs of Staff to record the provisional view that thepost-war needs of British security would require an air force of not less than200,000 Regular personnel, whilst the minimum requirements of the Navy andthe Army were stated in subsequent papers to be 170,000 and 275,000respectively.2. In course of discussion of these papers in the Chiefs of Staff Committeeon the 7th June, it was pointed out by Sir Douglas Evill that the estimatescontained in the papers by the Admiralty and the War Office had been calculated on a somewhat different basis from that adopted by the Air Ministry and thatit was important that, in a comparative calculation of this sort, the requirementsof all three Services should have a common basis.* C.O.S. (45) 154.
Common Basis of Calculation.3. Accordingly on this suggestion, the Chiefs of Staff Committee invited the Service Ministries to review their memoranda, agree on a common basis of calculation and then to recirculate their revised estimates to the Chiefs of staff committee for review.Uncertain Factors making Common Basis Unattainable.4. For the purpose of discovering a common basis of calculation andreconciling the estimates, an ad hoc meeting was held on the 27th June, 1945,which was attended by representatives of the Admiralty, War Office and AirMinistry under the chairmanship of Sir Guy Glover (D.A.G. (B), War Office),but careful examination showed the task to be one of considerable difficulty forthe following reasons : (a) Little indication is yet available of our total post-war strategical require-ments and still less of how the burden of their fulfilment is to be apportioned between the three Services; some forecast of the ultimaterelative strengths of the three Services is a necessary factor in arriving at the ratio between our iminediate provisionalestablishments.(b) Although the figures we are immediately concerned with relate topersonnel to be recruited on Regular engagements and would, there-fore, not include conscripts, it is not feasible for any of the three services to calculate its provisional requirements of the formerwithout having regard to the numbers of the latter to be enteredannually in each Service and the proportion which can be regardedas an effective addition to strength at any given moment.(c) In all their studies on the subject hitherto, and not least in the threeprovisional estimates which have just been submitted, the three services have placed different degrees of reliance on conscription,chiefly because of the fundamental difference between the conditionsof the three Services. Assuming conscription to be for a 12 months&apos;period, the Army would be inclined to regard one-half of its annualentry of conscripts as effective additions to its strength, whilst imtheNavy and the R.A.F. the fraction would be variable owing to the widedivergencies in the time required to train men for different roles.The Navy estimate the average proportion to be one-third or less. all were agreed, however, that, if conscription were for 18 months, itwould make a vast difference to this question.5. For the above reasons it was not found possible to discover a commonbasis now for the estimates of immediate requirements of post-war Regularpersonnel, and it was decided to submit to the Chiefs of Staff Committee a jointpaper setting forth provisional estimates of our separate requirements of personnel to be enlisted on Regular engagements, fully recognising that they arefounded on different bases of calculation, but making clear how the figures havebeen arrived at in each case. These provisional figures are the same as thosewhich have already been submitted separately, viz. : and the arguments in support of them are stated separately in paragraphs 7 to 9below.6. It is, however, necessary to bear in mind the important consequencefollowing from the adoption of different bases of calculation. The Ministry ofLabour have estimated the number of men likely to volunteer each year for Regularengagement in all three Services at 65,000. Whatever the actual figure is. itmay well prove, even with a long average term of service, insufficient to maintainthe sum of the three provisional estimates.Should this be so, some scaling down will be inevitable, but this cannot becarried out by a pro rata reduction because such a reduction, in view of the factors set out in paragraph 4 above, could not operate fairly between theServices. Some readjustment would be necessary, but this cannot be decideduntil post-war problems have been examined more closely and the relative respon-sibilities of the three Services and hence their relative strengths have been assessed.NavyArmy170,000275,000 and200,000R.A.F.[30492]b 2
Navy Estimate.7. From preliminary appreciations of the numbers and types of ships and naval aircraft which will be required to fulfil the Royal Navy&apos;s world-widecommitments in peace, it is estimated that a minimum of 170,000 long-service officers and ratings will be required, excluding any assistance by the Dominionsand Colonies.This estimate is an increase of 37,000 over the 1939 figure of 133,000. Theprincipal reasons for this are : (a) The technical and scientific developments and the increased weight ofair attack have brought about a considerable increase in the comple-ments of ships, notably to man the radar warning equipment and thelarge number of anti-aircraft weapons which are now so essential.(b) It will be necessary to maintain nucleus organisations for forces such asmine-sweeping and coastal forces which are now an integral part ofthe Fleet, and also a nucleus organisation to maintain the mobility of the Fleet, i.e., the Fleet Train.(c) Inter-Service co-operation must continue and so the post-war Navy must include a nucleus of amphibious forces both for training and for development.(d) Carrier-borne air forces are fundamental to sea warfare and an integral part of the Royal Navy. A large proportion of the Navy&apos;s man-powermust be devoted to this end. Besides the requirements of ship-borne aircraft, naval airfields must be maintained for flying training, andthe accommodation of disembarked aircraft.The necessity for all these increases and for these additional activities hasbeen proved during the war, and it will be necessary to maintain organisationsin peace to train personnel and to provide scope for technical progress.If conscription is continued into the peace years a further number of long-service officers and ratings will be required to train and administer the conscripts.Army Estimate.8. It is not possible to make any firm estimate as to the size of the activeArmy in the post-war period until the Empire&apos;s overall strategical commitmentshave been denned and the responsibility of the three Services in relation to eachother for meeting them has been agreed upon.A strategical appreciation prepared within the War Office indicated that an active embodied Army of some 700,000 to 800,000 might be needed. for planning purposes, however, a figure of 430,000 was provisionally accepted,although it was realised that it would almost certainly be insufficient. On theother hand, it was considered that planning on this basis would provide sufficientdetails of the structure required to permit adaptation for a larger Army.While there were many reasons for desiring that the whole 430,000 should befound from soldiers serving on Regular engagements, it was appreciated thatsuch a total of volunteers would probably not be forthcoming. It was accordingly decided to place considerable reliance on conscription and to plan for an activeArmy that should contain both soldiers serving on Regular engagements and con-scripts undergoing a year or more of embodied service. Even with conscription,however, the needs of service overseas, and the requirements in regard to trainingconscripts, will entail a large Regular content. With an active Army of 430,000made up of conscripts and Regulars, it would be impossible to create an efficientorganisation if the latter numbered less than, say, 275,000. This figure has accordingly been incorporated in various projects and described as the &quot; minimumRegular requirement,&quot; a proviso being made that, without conscription, it cannot possibly meet our needs and, even with conscription, it may well be insufficient.It is relevant to note that the last normal peace-time estimates, that is to say for1939, provided for a number of soldiers on Regular engagements of the order of230,000 all ranks. The minimum number for which the War Office seeks approvalis, therefore, not greatly in excess of pre-war peace establishments and, at thisstage, should only be regarded as a &quot;bid on account.&quot;R.A .F. Estimate.9. (i) At the outbreak of war, the strength of the regular personnel of theRoyal Air Force was 116,000 and, as stated by the Chief of the Air Staff inparagraph 5 of COS. (45) 321 (O), the force &quot; comprised a total of 156 squadrons at home and abi&apos;oad; we had virtually no Tactical Air Forces in the present
1   sense, since until just before the war it was not even our firm policy to deployan Army on the Continent; the strength of Coastal Command was insignificant,I   largely because it was believed that we had already the answer to the U-boat(menace; Transport Command was non-existent; we had no Operational Training-Units ; and the total inadequacy of our air forces overseas was expensively provedby the disasters of the early years.&quot; Authority was, however, given in the spring of 1939 for expansion of the force to 212 Squadrons, which would, under modernstandards, have required a larger number than the 400,000 in (ii) below.(ii) The first calculation of the size of the post-war Air Force resulted in a figure of 650,000. As this was considered likely to be in excess of what couldbe provided, a fresh calculation has been begun and a revision of the figurereveals that the smaller force now contemplated would comprise a total of some400,000, including conscripts.   .(iii) The figure of 200,000 &apos;&apos; on account&apos;&apos; for which approval is now soughtrepresents an increase over the pre-war strength of 72 per cent., or 33 per cent,of the spring 1939 target referred to in (i) above. It is in no sense an estimateof the minimum size of the,post-war Air Force, but no more than a fractionaltoken figure which, it is submitted, will be far exceeded; it is, however, large enough to be of very real assistance, if approved, in determining the career of theRegular airman in the post-war period and in appointing officers to permanent commisions.I(iv) The need for the approval of such a figure must be stressed. Very manyofficers of excellent quality will be lost to the Regular Air Force during the nextfew weeks if the number of permanent commissions which may be offered is not increased before the release scheme has been in operation much longer. Thenumber of airmen who have applied for Regular enlistment or re-engagement isonly a fraction of what is required for the smaller force envisaged in (ii) above,and the poor result of recent appeals to the Service can only be accounted for bythe absence of any details whatever of the conditions under which Regular airmenwill serve; it is impossible to expect volunteers to come forward to undertakeservice of whose conditions they are altogether ignorant. There is real danger that the Royal Air Force will be faced with an impossible task in building up its peace-time strength unless the authority now sougdrfc is granted. There is anopportunity now, which will not recur, of laying the foundations of the permanentAir Force upon experienced and tried volunteers, so that the force will be readywhen required to play its part in meeting the Empire&apos;s strategical commitments in the post-war world.Avoidance of Special Inducements in Recruiting.10. An important factor in support of the present proposals is the veryconsiderable saving of expense which they are likely to afford. If the three services are unable to secure sufficient men on permanent engagements from themen who are temporarily serving and wish to continue, they will be faced withthe necessity at a.later date of offering special bounties or gratuities as induce-ments to recruits. Such measures would be avoided if sufficient men of the requisite standard can be enrolled while serving on their war-time engagements.H Conclusion.11. Accordingly, for the reasons set out above, we put forward our separateproposals in a joint paper and seek authority to use these proposals as a temporary basis upon which to retain in the Services those who are willing, if some prospectE is afforded to them, to stay on upon Regular engagements. Although we are\, fully conscious of their limitations, these provisional proposals are of an urgentcharacter if we are not soon to lose, as the release scheme operates, the valuabletrained men whom we wish to retain as the nucleus of the post-war forces andwho, if they are now offered good prospects and some security of tenure, would beglad to remain. Finally, we desire to emphasise as strongly as possible that anyapproval which may be given to the present proposals applies only to what isin the nature of a token instalment, for the limited purpose set out above, and is entirely without prejudice to the ultimate size of the three Services, to bedetermined when post-war strategic requirements have been settled.
