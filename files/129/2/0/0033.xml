THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;9 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET. . Copy No.CP. (45) 183.20th September, 1945.   .CABINET.SELLING PRICE OF HOUSES.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.AT the meeting of the Cabinet on the 6th September (CM. (45) 29thConclusions, Minute 6) I said that I felt it would not be possible to introduce legislation to implement the recommendations of the Morris Report on the selling price of houses during the current Session, and I undertook to circulate a memorandum setting out the reasons which, had led me to this conclusion.2. I need hardly stress the heavy claims on Parliamentary time involvedin the programme of legislation which has already been approved. A Bill tocontrol the sale-price of houses would certainly be controversial and, if it is tobe so drawn as effectively to prevent large-scale evasion (e.g., by collateral trans-actions or payments to agents and intermediaries) would be of some length and complexity. Further, if there is to be legislation, it should be passed (and themachinery for administering it established) early in the Session, in order to meetthe needs of demobilised Service men and war workers. The case for the bill would become progressively weaker as the volume of new building, temporary and permanent, grows.. 3. . While accepting the view that an effective system of control would prevent a good deal of extortion admittedly a desirable end in itself^ I must point out that it would make no such contribution to the central problem ofincreasing accommodation, particularly of the type for which the demand will beheaviest, as would justify the legislation proposed.4. The Committee made it clear that the practicability of the schemedepends on the ability of the Valuation Office to carry out the work involved.On this I have made some enquiries, the upshot of which is as follows :- The best estimate, based on past experience, as to the probable number of transactions in which a yaluation by a &quot;District Valuer would be required isabout 160,000 a year. This figure might be substantially increased if everyonewho had a vague intention of disposing of his house were allowed, without incurring any cost, to seek the advice of the Valuer. On the other hand, it mightbe decreased by the reluctance of persons to sell houses at a maximum price fixed by an Act of Parliament. On the basis of 160,000 the Inland Revenue Depart-ment calculate that their existing valuation staff of some 530 would have&apos; to beincreased by about 300, with corresponding increases of clerical and otherauxiliary staff. The release of Valuation Officers in the Department now in theForces would make practically no difference. They amount to some 30 or 40only. Moreover, there are few competent Valuers available in the ordinarymarket. It would, therefore, be necessary to secure the immediate release fromthe Forces under Class B of some 300 men with the qualifications and experienceof Valuers. This would probably take some months and it is thought that itwould be hardly possible to get the new machinery in working order before theearly summer of next year.In addition to a largely increased staff, absolute priority would be needed for fresh accommodation.Consideration has been given to the question whether it would be possibleto carry out the new work without additional staff by giving it priority over[30550]
existing tasks. I understand that this would involve postponing one or more ofthe following operations :&apos;i Valuation of estates for Estate Duty purposes.War damage work (likely to reach its peak shortly and continue for&quot;: one or two years).Advice on sale and letting of Government factories and other workfor MA.P. and Ministry of Supply connected with the switch-over from war,to peace. ..,Work under the Requisitioned Land and War Works Act (also connectedwith the switch-over).Work connected with the purchase of land for housing and otherreconstruction purposes, and for the development areas under the Town and country Planning Act, 1944.I think that it will be agreed that none of this work should be allowed to fall into arrear.The Committee&apos;s report suggests that there should be an appeal from a district Valuer to an official arbitrator. The Inland Revenue Departmentconsider that if these appeals were numerous the valuation machinery wouldbreak down since the,time of District Valuers occupied in conducting a case on appeal is far greater than the time spent on the original valuation. Moreover,in the absence of a large increase in the number of official arbitrators of whom there are at present only two for England and Wales, the transaction of business in house property might be seriously held up.A rough estimate of the cost involved (excluding the cost of proceedings before the official arbitrators) is as follows : - 300 Valuers at  600 a year............      180,000200 Clerks, Shorthand Writers, &amp;o, at  225       ...        45,000225,000Accommodation; Postal and Telephone Service;Stationery; Travelling, &amp;c.     ....      ... 40,000265,000These figures do not include the increase of cost in Scotland which is put at about 10 per cent, of the above figure, sav  30,000, making an aggregate total ofabout  300,000.5. The further consideration which I have given to the question and theresult of the enquiries I have made confirm me in my opinion that, despite the criticism which is to be anticipated, legislation to implement the Committee&apos;srecommendations should not be introduced.A. B.Ministry of He&amp;lth, S.W.1,20th September, 1945.
