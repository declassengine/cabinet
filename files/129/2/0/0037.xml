TtfIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1945.secret. Copy No.CP. (45) 187.21st September, 1945.idCABINET.MAN-POWER IN THE CIVIL SERVICE.Minute by the Prime Minister.IT is of the utmost importance that, concurrently with demobilisation of the armed Forces and the reduction of the munitions programme, there should bethe speediest reduction in administrative and clerical staffs, both at headquarters and in the Regions, of Departments engaged on duties in connection with theconduct of the war.Our general man-power position is such that the handling of urgent currentwork will be severely hampered unless arrangements are made by departments for the speedy release of staff hitherto engaged on war-time duties. We cannot afford a leisurely process of reduction at a time when all our energies are needed for reconstruction.Departments were asked by the Treasury at the end of the war in Europe to review their war-time functions and to discontinue or reduce them as rapidly as possible. Now that the war in the Far East is over this process, which doesnot seem to be proceeding fast enough, could be greatly accelerated. Depart-ments will be asked by the Treasury to report progress on this matter within thenext two months.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,21st September, 1945.
