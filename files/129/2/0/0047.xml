Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET. Copy-No.&apos;   73CP. (45) 197.28th September, 1945.CABINET.FUTURE OF THE MINISTRY OF SUPPLY.Memobandum by the Chiefs of Staff.1. The draft statement forming part of Annex II to CP. (45) 178 contains a number of proposals for adjusting the relationship between the Board of Tradeand a new Ministry of Supply to be formed by the amalgamation of the Ministriesof Supply and Aircraft Production. The Chiefs of Staff are not concerned with many of these proposals. We have, however, strong views upon that part of thedraft statement which reads as follows : &quot; The primary duty of the combined Ministry will be the furnishing ofsupplies, and the carrying out of research, design, and development for thefighting Services to the extent that these functions are undertaken by the two.Ministries at the present time.&quot;We are definitely and firmly opposed to the arrangement described in the abovequotation, except as far as it relates to certain ranges of common-user stores and miscellaneous stores. We are convinced that research, development, design, and production of special warlike stores should be the responsibility of the Service&apos;Ministries.2. The main arguments upon which our view is founded have been set outin Papers* circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for Air and theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War. We endorse all these argu-ments, but we would like to emphasise two points in particular.3. There is an endless chain running from user through research, experi-ment, design, development, production, back to user. During the war this chainhas been cut by an arrangement of departmental responsibility which leaves the-user isolated from the remainder, except in the Admiralty. Under the com-pulsion of war, great efforts have been made to bridge over the gap in the chain a process which was made easier by the fact that, when the Ministry of Supply andthe Ministry of Aircraft Production were formed, they took over bodily sectionsof the War Office and the Air Ministry respectively. If, however, the separation .is maintained, the gap will inevitably become more pronounced, particularly sincethe Ministry of Supply will have many important activities in a purely civil field.The close relationship between the Serviceman, the scientist, and the industrialist,,which daily becomes of greater importance, will be seriously impaired.4. The difficulty cannot be overcome by the seconding of officers from theServices to the Ministry of Supply. Even when the War Office and the AirMinistry were responsible for providing their own equipment, they found thatthere was often a lack of touch between the operational and planning staffs onthe one hand, and the technical staffs on the other. There was a tendency, whichit was difficult to control, for the creation of a separate breed of technical officers,,separated out from the main stream, of Service life and thought. If the presentdemarcation of authority between the Service and Supply Departments is per-petuated, this tendency will be much more marked, opportunities for directcontacts will be diminished, and the proper blending of the operational, adminis-trative, and technical staffs will become impossible.    The staffs responsible for* CP. (45) 177 and 181.[30604]
&quot;strategic thought and planning will know less and less about technical possibili-ties, while the technical and production staffs will know less and less about military-needs.  This is a state of affairs which would lead to disaster.5. The second point is that, whereas in 1914, and again in 1939, the main problem which confronted us was the gradual mobilisation after the outbreak ofwar of the whole resources of the nation for large-scale production of warmaterial, the case in future is likely to be very different. The startling advancesnow being made in the scientific and technical field make it certain that, if we areever confronted in the future with a fight for our existence, success may largelyif not entirely turn upon technical superiority at the outbreak of war. If instrategical, scientific, and technical thought and action we are not in the lead, thewar may well be lost long before we get to the stage of large-scale production.Even in 1940 we were within an ace of losing the war at the outset, and were largely saved by the technical superiority of our fighter aircraft, of our R.D.F.,and of our anti-submarine equipment. These technical triumphs, be it noted,Avere the outcome of full co-ordination within the Service Departments of themilitary and technical staffs. &quot;We therefore regard it as vital that, from the topto the bottom of the Service Departments, there should be the closest possibleintegration between the Officers who have to direct the forces and their scientific and.industrial colleagues.6. It is clear to everyone that any human organisation cannot be perfect,and machinery to govern so wide and complicated a range of operations as theprovision of specialist warlike stores cannot be an exception. In settling theorganisation, therefore, the right course can only be to decide what are the overriding factors, and to make sure that the organisation satisfies the require-ments of these, even if it does not entirely meet all requirements of lesser impor-tance. In our opinion the overriding factors in this case are those which wehave outlined above, and it is for this reason that the Service Departments them-selves, both in peace and war, must be responsible for the whole process ofproviding their own specialist warlike stores.7. But apart from the arguments on the immediate issue, it must beremembered that the machinery for providing equipment is only a part of themachinery for the higher direction of preparations for, and conduct of, war.It is an ever-increasingly important part, but it must be viewed in relation tothose other parts which deal with the formulation of strategic plans, the relation of strategy to technology. The last six years have been years of remarkabledevelopment, not only in science and technology and in the influence of equipment on strategy, but also in the development of the machineryfor the conduct of war, and in the co-ordination of, and co-operationbetween, the Services. Now is the time to examine the lessons of this period,and to frame a comprehensive scheme for the future. We are convinced thatto allocate to the Ministry of Supply responsibility for special warlike storeswould be a step towards disintegration when integration is the supreme need.8. To sum up, our conclusions are as follows. We consider that the futuresafety of the country may well be endangered if, under the new organisation, theproposed Ministry of Supply is given inter alia the responsibility for research,design, development and production of special warlike stores for the fightingservices. In our view, it should be an accepted principle that these functionsshould be in the hands of the Service Ministries. We suggest that recent develop-ments in warfare and technology call for an investigation into the higherorganisation for defence, but we are clear that the aim in that enquiry shouldbe to secure the closest integration of military and scientific thought, and thatany measures which make for separation should be avoided.(Signed) A.
