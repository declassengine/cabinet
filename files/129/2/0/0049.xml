Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.Copy No. 6CABINET.POLICY IN REGARD TO MALAYA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.AT their meeting on the 3rd September, 1945, the Cabinet approved thepolicy in regard to Malaya outlined in CP. (45) 133. In connection with thequestion of the extent, method and timing of publicity for this policy, and inconsultation and agreement with the Lord Privy Seal, as Chairman of theColonial Affairs Committee, I represented to the Prime Minister the followingviews and proposals as being matters for very urgent decision in the current situation in Malaya. ^-2. Publicity in any detail about our Malayan policy commits us to the fulfilment of that policy. This means that we cannot allow ourselves to be deterred by an obstinate attitude on the part of any or all of the Malay Rulerswith whom Sir Harold MacMichael will have to deal in his forthcoming mission.I regard it, however, as very essential, quite apart from the matter of publicity,that His Majesty&apos;s Government should now affirm their intention to carry through, in spite of obstruction on the part of any particular Malay Ruler, thepolicy which they have approved. All our plans for the Malay States depend upon the success of Sir Harold MacMichaeks efforts to secure jurisdiction ineach and all of the States. It is essential that his hand should be strengthened by the firm assurance that he can, if necessary, make it clear to any recalcitrantSultan that we intend to carry our policy through. I attach as an Annex to this paper an explanatory memorandum, which I propose that Sir Harold should hand to each Sultan on opening discussions. It will be seen that this Memorandumleaves no doubt of His Majesty&apos;s firm intention to carry their plans into effect.This, then, is the first point on which definite assurance needs to be given.3. I then envisage three phases of publicity. The first phase will be astatement in general terms, designed to create public interest in the directionof that unity and common citizenship in Malaya which our policy will entail. Ishall require some discretion as to timing, but I would propose to inauguratethis phase by a public reference, during the next fortnight, to these two points of unity and common citizenship. I attach, as Annex II to this paper, a brief statement which I would use as a:basis.4. The second phase must be expected to follow after possibly only a shortinterval. This phase will involve a more explicit statement of our intention toform a Malayan Union and of certain contingent proposals, such as the securingof jurisdiction from1 the Malay Rulers and the splitting up of the present colonyof the Straits Settlements. It will also involve an explicit statement about the separate treatment of Singapore.5. It will be best if this second phase of publicity can synchronise with sir Harold MacMichael&apos;s work. Information as to our detailed intentions will inevitably be disclosed in Malaya as soon as he opens discussions with any Sultan,since it is necessary for the success of these discussions that he should give eachSultan an outline of the future Malaya and of their own place in it. It wouldbe a mistake from the point of view of this country and of the Straits Settlementsto let our policy leak out from- the first of the Malay Rulers with whom Sir HaroldMacMichaei establishes contact; and therefore an authoritative expose of thesecond phase should be made by myself in London at or about the time when sir Harold starts his work in Malaya. He is expected to do so during the first half of this month, and I therefore propose to make a statement in the House of[30618] BSECRET.CP. (45) 199.4th October, 1945.
Commons after it reassembles, in which I shall (a) outline the specific proposalsreferred to in paragraph 4 above, and (b) promise a full disclosure in the formof a White Paper as soon as circumstances permit.6. This White Paper would constitute the third phase. It could not, ofcourse, be laid until preliminary steps, such as the negotiation of the new Agree-ments with the Sultans, had been completed.7. In proposing the early inception of a programme of publicity, I aminfluenced by very recent information as to the present political state of affairs in malaya. This information indicates that politically the most difficult body of chinese in the Peninsula (the main group of the Resistance Movement and largelyChinese &quot; Communists &quot;) have set before themselves a goal which corresponds in very many respects with our own policy. It is not too much to say that the wholeof our relations with the Chinese population of Malaya may be fundamentallyaffected by a timely statement of our intentions.8.   To sum up, I recommended &apos;(a) that we should affirm His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s intention to carry through the policy which they have approved, in spite of possibleobstacles in the form of, for instance, recalcitrance by any or all of theSultans.(b) that there should be a phased programme of publicity commencing witha public statement by myself in general terms, continuing with a more detailed statement by myself in the House as soon as it reassembles onthe 10th October, and concluding with a White Paper as soon as circumstances permit.The Prime Minister approved my proposals subject to the Chiefs of Staffhaving no objection from the security angle. I have ascertained that they have noobjection, and I am circulating this memorandum to my colleagues to keep theminformed of the lines on which I am now proceeding in these Malayan affairs.G. H. H.Colonial Office,4th October, 1945.ANNEX I.Draft of Memorandum which Sir Harold MacMichael will hand to the malay Rulers in explaining to them His Majesty&apos;s Government^intentions as regards the future of malaya.Memorandum on Future Constitution for Malay Peninsula.THE Cabinet has finally confirmed the policy of creating a Malayan Union(as opposed to an extended Federation of Malay States) which will comprise allthe Malay States in the Peninsula, together with the Settlements of Penang andMalacca. The Constitution of the Union will provide for a central authority(both Executive and Legislative) from which all other authorities in the Peninsulashould derive their powers. (This postulate is inherent in the conception of a union as opposed to that of a Federation.)2. Subject to this basic conception the nine Malay States and the Settle-ments of Penang and Malacca will be retained as geographical units with theirpresent boundaries to deal with such local affairs as may be devolved upon themby the central authority.3. One of the most important matters to settle is the position of the MalayRulers under the new Constitution. The idea that there should be an UpperChamber of Sultans has been examined, but it is not felt that this would be appropriate. The possibility has been rejected partly because of the difficultyof devising satisfactory relations between the Lower and Upper Chamberspartly because the Sultans do not possess the necessary qualifications to perform the functions of a Second Chamber in any real and effective manner, partly because a Second Chamber of Malay Sultans would be an inappropriate organ in theGovernment of a country of which important areas will be parts of the present
British. Colony of the Straits Settlements, and partly because it would be outof keeping with the proposal that Malayan Union citizenship should comprisenot only Malays but people of every race who have made Malaya their homeland.It is proposed, instead, that the Sultans collectively should form an AdvisoryCouncil to the Governor. The subjects with which this Council would be con-. cerned would be principally questions of Mohammedan religion (in, relation towhich the special position of the Sultans has always been recognised), but other subjects would also be open for discussion in the Council either at the instanceof the Governor or at the instance of any of the Sultans with the Governor&apos;consent. The functions of the Council are further described in paragraph 8beneath. It would meet regularly under the&apos; presidency of the Governor andwould be regarded as a permanent body. Its meetings would be attended by allthe ceremony necessary to maintain the personal dignity of the Sultans. It wouldnot, however, impair the right of direct access between individual Sultans andthe Governor. It is felt that the new position of the Sultans should be defined in the Constitution itself. When the time comes to negotiate the new Treatiesthis will be necessary to satisfy the Sultans, who will not be content to be toldvaguely that &quot; an appropriate position &quot; will be allotted to them by the newCentral Legislature.4. Apart from the Governor, the three principal officers of Governmentwill be the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary.The position of the British Residents or Advisers in each of the States shouldbe modified. Before the war, the status of these officers was higher than thatOf any other officials save the High Commissioner, but with the establishmentof the Union Government their importance will diminish and they should be madesubordinate to the Chief Secretary of the Union Government. It is proposedthat these officers, as well as the officers at the head of the two Settlements, shouldbe uniformly styled &quot; Resident Commissioners.&quot;5. It is proposed that Executive and Legislative Councils for the MalayanUnion should be created with the following constitution : The Executive Council should have 5 official and 5 unofficial members, inaddition to the Governor. Of the official members the Chief Secretary, the attorney-General and the Financial Secretary should be ex officio, while the other2 would be nominated by the Governor. The unofficial members would also be nominated by the Governor. A racial basis should not be prescribed for suchnominations, but in the first instance it would be desirable that there should be oneEuropean, one Malay, one Chinese and one Indian unofficial member, the Governorbeing left to nominate the most suitable unofficial to fill the remaining vacancyregardless of race. Save with the consent of the Governor, unofficial membership of the Executive Council would be confined to Malayan Union Citizens.The Legislative Council should have, besides the Governor, 21 official and 21unofficial members. Fourteen of the latter should represent areas on a popula-tion basis, and the remainder should represent important interests throughout theUnion; there has hitherto been no experience of any system of elections in Malaya,and for an initial phase at any rate it would be desirable that the unofficial members should be nominated by the Governor, who would be required to selectsuitable persons on the above representative basis as far as possible. Five of theofficial members would be the official members of the Executive Council and theremainder would be nominated by the Governor.6. When Military Administration ceases and the new Civil Government is established in the Malay Peninsula, it is likely to be impracticable, even if it weredesirable, to complete the formal instruments necessary to set up a LegislativeCouncil immediately. To cover the interregnum between, the end of the military administration and the setting up of a Legislative Council, the new constitution should specifically provide for the Governor alone to be responsible for legislation,and for the establishment of an Advisory Council to assist him in this task. TheGovernor would normally consult this Advisory Council before enacting Legisla-tion. but would not be bound to accept the councils advice. The instrumentshould not specify the precise number of official and unofficial members, but theGovernor should be instructed to guide himself as far as possible, when makingappointments by the intended composition of the Legislative Council as set out inparagraph 5 above.7.   The next question to be considered is the future of the State and Settle-ment Councils.   In the past, the Sultans were Presidents of the State Councils[30618] B 2
but the Councils were largely composed of Malays, and made scant provision forany representation of non-Malay interests. In the new constitutional arrangements it would be inappropriate that a Malay Sultan should preside, andit will be desirable that the President of the State 6r Settlement Council of thefuture should be the Resident Commissioner. Exact membership cannot be defined in advance, but members should be appointed by the Governor after consulting the resident Commissioner. As regards the nomination of unofficial Representatives,all practicable regard should be paid to the racial proportions of the settledpopulation of each State and Settlement, but broader public interests should alsogovern selections.The State and Settlement Councils should be empowered to legislate (a) on all matters which, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, are of a merely local or private nature in the State or Settlement, and (b) on all subjects in respect ofwhich power is delegated to them by law by the Legislative Council of the MalayanUnion.8. In each State side by side with the State Councils there should beestablished Advisory Malay Councils to the Sultans, which should be preside over by the Sultan and whose members, subject to the Governor&apos;s approval, shouldbe appointed by the Sultan.The main functions of these Advisory Malay Councils would be in relationto matters affecting Mohammedan religion, but they would also advise the Sultanon other matters at the request of the Resident Commissioner and with theapproval of the Governor. On matters. of Mohammedan religion (with theexception of anything connected with the collection of taxes or tithes, which mustbe left strictly within the control of the Central Legislature&apos; or, the StateCouncils), it is proposed that the Sultans should have powers of legislating intheir individual States. In doing so, they would use their Advisory MalayCouncils, which for these purposes would be virtually legislative bodies. Leg i si a-tion resulting from this system would not, however, automatically and immediatelybecome law, but would require the Governor&apos;s assent. The Governor would in no case grant or refuse his assent without consulting his own Advisory Council ofMalay Sultans, though he would not be bound to accept their advice. It is felt thatthis proposal to leave legislative power on matters of Mohammedan religion inthe hands of the Sultans individually and collectively (subject to the necessarychecks as indicated above) should go a long way towards reconciling the Sultansto their new position, in that it would maintain their special status amongsttheir own Malay people in a field in which it has hitherto been always recognised.It is also felt that the proposal to refer legislation within this field to theGovernor&apos;s Advisory Council of Sultans would lend reality to the deliberationsof that body, which might otherwise be little more than a facade.9. It is proposed that the organisation of the Courts should be as follows :It is suggested that there should be a separate High Court of the MalayanUnion with a Chief Justice at its head. In addition to the Chief Justice, thereshould be judges of the High Court stationed at various suitable centres through-out the Peninsula. In accordance with previous practice and the dictates of economy the Chief Justice and the Puisne Judges of the Supreme Court in singapore should be declared ex officio judges in the High Court of the MalayanUnion and vice versa. In practice the Court of Appeal, whether sitting in theUnion or in Singapore, would invariably be composed of the two Chief Justicesand one Puisne Judge. There seems to be no reason for creating a separateCourt of Appeal, which would involve the appointment of Appeal Judges. Thenew constitution should provide for Appeals to the Privy Council from theCourt of Appeal of the Malayan Union.10. In order that the future Malayan Union mayr become a reality, it is felt that, subject to the exceptions noted below, all State and Settlementproperties should be transferred to the Union Government, which should assumefull liability for State and Settlement debts. The Union would take over allrevenues from the States and the Settlements, their cash, bank balances, securities,&amp;o, all State land, mines and minerals and all railways, ports and harbours(with the exception of the port and harbour properties vested in the PenangHarbour Board). The exception to this wholesale transfer of property relates to the residences and estates of the Sultans themselves and any buildings and land which are used for purposes of Mohammedan religion, as well as propertypertaining to the endowment of Mohammedan religious institutions. It is &quot;feltthat the above properties should be excluded from transfer to Union ownership,on the grounds that they are closely bound up with the Sultans&apos; personal prestige,
and with the position (which it is proposed to preserve) of the individual Sultans &quot;as leaders of their Malay subjects in their States in matters of Mohammedanreligion.In making provision for the exemption of these properties from transfer toUnion ownership, it is important to bear in mind that no commitment should begiven to the Sultans which would prevent the Defence authorities from acquiringthe necessary rights in property which they might require at any time for strategic purposes. Provided such commitments are not given, it is felt thatthis aspect of the matter need not be specifically mentioned in the new Constitu-tion. The mere exemption from transfer to Union ownership does not place the property in question irrevocably beyond the control of the Service authorities.The new treaties with the individual Sultans will themselves give His majesty the power to legislate in each State. It is important, in fact, to distinguish inthis connection between exemption from transfer to Union ownership and exemp-tion from His Majesty&apos;s jurisdiction.   The latter is, of course, not proposed.11. In order further to safeguard the personal position of the Sultans, itis felt that special provision should be made as regards their emoluments. Thesecannot actually be exempted from transfer to Union control (i.e., left to beprovided out of State funds), since under the new Constitution the States willhave only those revenues which they may receive or collect by the decision of thecentral Legislature of the Union. But it should nevertheless be ensured that theSultans&apos; personal allowances are continued from year to year on a scale appro-priate to their dignity and position.12. Finally, it is proposed that there should be express provision in theConstitution empowering the Courts to interpret it, and laying down that in caseof conflict, Ordinances of the Malayan Union must prevail over enactments ofState and Settlement Councils.ANNEX   II.Basis for Publicity (Phase 1).THE Japanese have now been evicted from Malaya, and the time has cometo lay down the broad lines which our future policy must follow, if we are to fulfilour duty towards Malaya and its people. From now on we must think of Malayaas one country with one destiny, that of eventual self-government within theBritish Commonwealth, a destiny to which all the inhabitants of Malaya can contribute. The conditions under which this goal can be reached must be fosteredin Malaya. The essential rights of the Malays must be safeguarded, but hence-forth each of the races forming the population of Malaya must have the full opportunity of helping to build the country&apos;s future, of developing and enjoyingon a basis of common effort and common opportunity the great material wealthof the Peninsula, and of reaping the benefit of their efforts, provided they infact regard Malaya as an object of loyalty. They must be citizens of Malaya,with all the rights and obligations which that term implies. No one must rely upon past privilege, or regard Malaya simply as a source of material wealth.While it is to the advantage of all the world, and not only Malaya, that theproduction of her mineral and agricultural resources should be restored and developed by industry and research, it is right that the Malayan people shouldbe assured of their share in the rewards of their industry and should be able to feel the country&apos;s wealth reflected in their own fuller standard of life.
