THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECEET. Copy No.CP. (45) 154.6th September, 1945.CABINET.TOBACCO PURCHASES IN THE UNITED STATES.Memorandum by the President of the Board oe Trade.AN immediate decision is required about our tobacco buying policy inthe United States.2. The tobacco is bought in the auctions on His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s account by the United States Commodity Credit Corporation. The -auctionshave just begun, and last till the end of the year. We have instructed theC.C.C. to buy for us from the 1945 crop 273 million lbs., equivalent to1146 million. This is our requirement for twelve months&apos; consumption at thepresent rate, and allows nothing for increased stock or exports. Do we changethese instructions ?3. My officials, in consultation with the Treasury, have examined thepossibility of a cut.   The following are the main considerations : (a) We cannot rely upon a reduction in consumption in 1946.(b) A forced cut in consumption, by rationing or otherwise, would be damaging to morale and would be double-edged for the national economy, for expenditure of  1 on tobacco imports yields about  10in revenue and is of great value in absorbing purchasing power and preventing inflation.(c) Our stocks of United States light tobacco in the United Kingdom and theUnited States at the 30th September are estimated by the TobaccoController as the equivalent of 8-8 months&apos; consumption. These arepartly in the Unifed States, partly in bond, and partly in manufac-turers&apos; hands. They are regarded as dangerously low. During 1944,i stocks in the United Kingdom at one time fell to b\ months&apos;consumption, and a cut in manufacture was narrowly avoided; andthere were then additional stocks in the United States.(dJ) We can make no immediate switch from the United States to othersuppliers. We are already taking the whole available export surplusfrom Empire countries at best 70 million lbs. It would take threeyears to build significant extra Rhodesian production, and, in anycase, additional absorption of Empire tobacco presents difficulties in public taste. The same, applies even more strongly to Macedonianand Turkish tobacco. The quantities available are trivial in relationto our United States supplies, and there is great difficulty even inabsorbing the small amount of Turkish which we now receive in payment of service on certain loans.(e) If the huge war-time consumption increase in the United States is main-tained, there will be a serious world tobacco shortage in 1946. Ifwe reduce our purchases now, the American companies whose stockshave been greatly cut will readily buy more. If we enter the 1946crop season on minimum stocks, we may be badly squeezed, not onlyon price but also on availability of supplies. However, the United- , States tobacco interests are very eager to maintain their UnitedKingdom market.[30479]
4. If we cut our purchases, we therefore run a risk of inability tomaintain manufacture and consumption in 1946 and perhaps a more serious risk of being unable to purchase our full requirements from the 1946 crop which would lead to a serious consumption crisis in 1947 or, alternatively, anincrease in prices against us.5. It is now for the Cabinet to decide whether we can afford to take these risk in order to save dollars now, and in order to make a clear demonstrationto the Americans of our determination to save dollars, even at the cost of risks.This is our largest dollar user, and if we leave it untouched we shall find itdifficult to resist claims from other similar users (e.g., films) that they too shouldbe left untouched.6. Officials have consulted the Tobacco Advisory Committee, who are ofthe opinion that the present rate of manufacture could be maintained if the cut did not exceed 35 million lbs. (i.e., a reduction, in stocks over the year of1\ months&apos; consumption), and if they were assured that no dollar difficulty would prevent the replacement from the 1946 crop of a year&apos;s using of Americantobacco; if such an assurance could not be given later in the year it would benecessary, in their opinion, to cut manufacture in order to safeguard the 1947position. This 35 milliondb. cut would save $18 million. A larger cut wouldrequire an immediate reduction in the rate of manufacture.7. My own opinion is that the combined effect of demobilisation, reducedpurchasing power, and increased supplies of consumers goods in 1946, maycreate some reduction in tobacco consumption, and the present stocks, thoughvery low, can be reduced to some extent. If the dollar situation requires it,and if the reduction would have a beneficial effect upon the negotiations I would favour a reduction of 35 million lbs. in our purchases from the 1945 crop. Ifthe Cabinet decides to do this, it will be necessary for the Tobacco Controller tohave a few days to make the consequent arrangements for curtailing operations in the market, and it is most important that our intentions should be kept secret.R. S.&quot; C.Board of Trade, S. W. 1,6th September, 1945.i
