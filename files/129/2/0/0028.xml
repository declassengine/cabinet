ANNEX II.Prime Minister.1. In accordance with your minute of the 5th September, I have discussed with the Service and Supply Ministers, the President of the Board of Tradeand the Minister for Civil Aviation the draft statement about the functions ofthe Ministries of Supply and of Aircraft Production which you annexed to yourminute.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty wishes words to be introduced into thedraft statement to avoid giving the impression that the combined Ministriesof Supply and Aircraft Production will become responsible for the supply ofships to the Royal Navy and their special armaments. Since there is no difference of view about this, I have incorporated suitable words, which are acceptable tothe Minister of Supply and of Aircraft Production, into a revised version of thedraft statement which I am attaching to this minute.3. The Secretaries of State for War and Air have raised more fundamentalissues. If a public announcement is made on tihe lines of the draft statementit will be generally interpreted as implying that the Government intend tomaintain, on a permanent basis, a Ministry of Supply responsible for procuringthe warlike and other stores required by the War Office and Air Ministry and stores common to the Admiralty and these Departments. The Secretaries ofState for War and Air do not see their way to agree to the issue at this stage ofany statement which implies that the Ministries of Supply and Aircraft Pro-cluction are to continue on a permanent basis. They refer to the long andinconclusive discussions about the organisation of Government supply which tookplace on the Machinery of Government Committee under the Coalition Govern-ment. Before any final decision is taken they would wish a fresh examinationof the general issue, at which they could present their case for becoming respon-sible as before the war for their own specialised war-like stores. Thesuggestion was also made that the Chiefs of Staff should be allowed to putforward their views on the matter.4. The agreement of the Service Ministers could readily be secured to theissue of an announcement on the lines of the attached draft, subject to theaddition of a statement that long-term arrangements for the supply of specialisedstores for the Army and R.A.F. were still under examination. I am not myselfin favour of a temporising statement on these lines. I consider that a definite decision should be announced at an early date. My own view is that a Ministryof Supply responsible inter alia for specialised stores for the Army and R.A.F. should be a permanent feature of the machinery of Government. It will, ofcourse, be necessary to safeguard the interests of the War Office and Air Ministry,but this can be done by ensuring that the Ministry of Supply is so organised thatthe Service Departments can be assured of continuous and specific attentionto their problems, that there is a free inter-change of actively-minded officersbetween the Fighting Services and the Ministry of Supply and that research and development is so organised as to give full scope to the interests and initiative of the user Departments.
5. The President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Supply andof Aircraft Production agree to the proposed division of duties between them which is outlined in the draft statement.6. I suggest that, in view of the attitude taken up by the Secretaries ofState for War and Air, it would be unwise to take a final decision without allowing the matter to be fully ventilated in Cabinet, on the basis of this Minuteand papers to be submitted by the Ministers concerned, and (with your consent)by the Chiefs of Staff if they so desire.PI. M.14th September, 1945.ORGANISATION OF GOVERNMENT SUPPLY,Draft Statement.1. When the present Government was formed the Ministry of Supply andthe Ministry of Aircraft Production were put under the charge of one Minister.No ministerial appointment was made to the Ministry of Production, which,under the late Government, had been brought under the charge of the Presidentof the Board of Trade.This statement outlines broadly (a) the organisation and responsibilities of the combined Ministries ofSupply and Aircraft Production;(b) the disposition of the functions of the Ministry of Production;(c) the division of responsibilities between the Board of Trade and the ministries of Supply and Aircraft Production.[2, Ministries of Supply and Aircraft Production.For the immediate future the two Ministries will preserve their individualidentities, but the intention is that they should be amalgamated into one new ministry as soon as practicable.The primary duty of the combined Ministry will be the furnishing of supplies,and the carrying out of research, design and development, for the Fighting Services,to the extent that these functions are undertaken by the two Ministries at thepresent time. This duty will be carried out in close collaboration with theService Departments in order to ensure that the &quot;user&quot; interests are givenproper weight. The combined Ministry will, however, also be responsible for&apos; s supply (and, in many cases, the design) of a large range of stores used byi Government, for which concentration of purchasing arrangements seemsrantageous.
The combined Ministry will carry the primary Government responsibility inthe field of engineering^The Board of Trade will remain responsible for general questions ofindustrial and commercial policy, and so far as these questions arise in connectionwith engineering the Ministry of Supply and of Aircraft Production will workin close co-operation with the Board of Trade.3. Ministry of Production.The Ministry of Production has been merged in the Board of Trade organisa-tion and has ceased to exist as a separate entity. For formal reasons it will benecessary for the immediate present to retain two Votes in Parliament.Certain of the Ministry&apos;s duties were of an arbitral nature in particular-(a) the allocation of materials, and(6) certain priorities for the allocation of labour.These functions cannot properly be performed by the Board of Trade, since that department is itself a large claimant for labour and materials, and arrangements have been made for these arbitral functions to be carried out inter-departmentallyunder the supervision of Ministers without departmental interest in the matter.4. Relations between new Supply Ministry and the Board of Trade.The Raw Materials Department of the Ministry of Supply and the RawMaterials Controls of that Department will be transferred to the Board of trade as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made. Pending transfer, the RawMaterials Department and the Controls will operate under the direction of thePresident of the Board of Trade. (In so far as their action depends upon powersderived from the Ministry of Supply Act, the Minister of Supply and of aircraft production will act as the agent of the President of the Board of Trade.)There is, however, an important exception to this transfer of responsibilityfor raw materials. Since the Ministries of Supply and Aircraft Production will carry the primary Government responsibility in the field of engineering, the Ironand Steel Control and the Light Metal Control will remain with the Ministry ofSupply and of Aircraft Production.The Non-Ferrous Metals Control will pass to the Board of Trade.The Board of Trade will assume responsibility for all non-engineering industries (e.g., chemicals), which during the war have been the concern of the ministries of Supply and Aircraft Production.* If a definition of engineering industry is required the following is suggested:  &quot; For this purpose, the Engineering Industry is defined as covering the manufacture ofmachinery of all kinds and of other products, mainly of metal, which involve relativelycomplex engineering processes. It would include munitions, aircraft, all engines, motor vehicles, bicycles, machine tools, hand tools, small tools, electrical machinery and equipment,radio, precision instruments, watches, clocks, bearings, rolling stock, cables, lamps, refrigerationplant, metal housing fitments, and general engineering products. It would exclude for thispurpose such products as musical instruments, metal toys, hardware, hollow-ware, metalfurniture and jewellery.&quot;
