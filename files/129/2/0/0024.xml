Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 174.17*A September, 1945.CABINET.MIDDLE EAST POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will remember that in Cabinet Paper (45) 130 of the28th August, I suggested that I should call back from the Middle EastHis Majesty&apos;s Representatives to discuss with them British policy in that region.My suggestion was agreed, and a conference of British representatives in theMiddle East met in London from Wednesday, the 5th September, to Monday,the 17th September, 1945, under my chairmanship.2.   The Conference was composed of (a) His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Bagdad, Cairo and Tehran;(.6) His Majesty&apos;s Ministers at Beirut and Jedda;(c) The High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan;\d) Representatives of the British Middle East Office; and(e) The Director-General of the Middle East Supply Centre.Representatives of the Foreign Office and other interested London Departmentsalso attended.3. I charged the Conference with the duty of surveying the whole field offoreign policy in the Middle East on the basis that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould continue to assert their political predominance in that area and theiroverriding responsibility for its defence.4. I suggested that the matter ought to be viewed in the light of thefollowing considerations :- (a) Influence that rested on military or political props could not be enduring;we should broaden the base on which British influence rests and to thisend should develop an economic and social policy that would make for the prosperity and contentment of the area as a whole.(&amp;) To reach the right solution of our Middle East problems it wras necessaryto consider the area as a single region.(c) We had the benefit of the war-time experience of the Middle East SupplyCentre which had, in fact, pursued a policy of economic co-ordinationthroughout the region in co-operation with the Territorial Govern-ments.(d) We should aim at an economic partnership between the United Kingdomand the Middle East countries and, by promoting developments inthat field, move towards a partnership in the sphere of defence.(e) Measures for the promotion of British trade in the region should alsobe formulated.(/) Step by step with activities in the economic and commercial field weshould do all that we could to promote the social betterment of thepeople of the region.(g) The whole question would have to be studied in relation to the capacityof the United Kingdom to make a contribution to the development ofthe Middle East by way of capital (where it was needed), equipment or the services of technical experts.(h) It would be necessary to take into account the political and economic factors arising out of (i) the Palestine question, and(ii) the activities of the United States, France and Soviet Russia inthe Middle East.12927   [30526]
5.   The Conference took these various questions into their consideration and a full exchange of views took place as a result of which I make the following&apos; . recommendations to the Cabinet: 1(a) Palestine. This question is dealt with in another Cabinet Paper.I(b) United States&apos; activities.(i) The Americans are commercially on the offensive in the Middle East;but their export drive has now been held up by the stringencyof the dollar situation in the Middle East countries. This stateof affairs has produced a degree of exasperation in Americanminds which is not likely to be removed unless some relief in the dollar situation is forthcoming. This circumstance (for whichwe are blamed, but not responsible) dominates our relationships with the Americans in the Middle East, but we cannot afford tomake any concessions in view of our difficult foreign exchangesituation.(ii.) The experiment in Anglo-American co-operation that took shapein the Middle East Supply Centre has survived, but only justsurvived, the war and does not offer much encouragement for a continuance of co-operation, at least in that form, in fields thatare essentially competitive,(idi) &quot;With, the lifting of war-time controls (for which in the middle east the Americans have been vigorously - and prematurelypressing for some time) we shall enter a period of commercialrivalry, and we should not make any concession that would assistAmerican commercial penetration into a region which for genera-tions has been an established British market.(c) Relations with France.(i) In the Middle East, our relations with France centre in the situationin the Levant States to the almost complete exclusion of any otherconsideration.(ii) His Majesty&apos;s Government have publicly announced; their desireto see Fr^nce maintain her privileged position in that area, if she is able to get it from the States themselves. Cur intervention in Syria during the disturbances in the early summer of this yearrestored our prestige in the Arab world to a point as high asit had ever stood before; but any overt support we might give to the French to secure a position which the States themselves arenot disposed to give them in. free negotiation, would without doubt be viewed, by the whole of the Arab world with hostility.(iii) The French appear to have created an impossible position for themselves in Syria and all but done so in the Lebanon. Anyparticipation by French nationals (at least as representatives ofthe French Government) in administrative or advisory capacitiesin the Levant States may be ruled out of account until thepresent animosities have subsided.(iv) The Conference endorsed my recommendation that the most fruitfulline of: approach to a solution of the present difficult situationin the Levant States was by way of an early conference ofrepresentatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the FrenchGovernment and the Governments of the Levant States.(d) Russian Activities.(i) Our short-term relations with Russia in the Middle East crystallisein the situation in Persia, where the Russians and ourselves are under a Treaty obligation to withdraw our troops witlhin sixmonths of the end of the Japanese War. This question is now before the Council, of Foreign Ministers.(ii) There are increasing signs of Russian political and economicjDenetration in almost all Middle East territories. These areviewed with extreme apprehension by the Governments and people in those countries. The most effective counter to Russianadvances in the area is the economic and social betterment of thepeople whose lot under the existing social system makes them Bready listeners to the propaganda of Communism.
(e) Defence. The Conference had the. opportunity of hearing informalviews from the Chiefs-of-Staff on the defence of the Middle East,against the background of my proposal that we should work towards apartnership between the United Kingdom and the Middle BastTerritories themselves in matters of defence. The question will befurther studied by the Chiefs of Staff and formal recommendations made. It was, however, generally agreed by the Conference thatthe question of defence is susceptible of most effective treatmentwithin the framework of our general policy towards the region.(f) British Economic Policy in the Middle East.(i) The Conference made certain recommendations with regard toBritish economic policy in the Middle East which are containedin Part I of the Annex to this memorandum.(ii) Summarised, they are : (1) Economic development and the amelioration of social conditions must go forward hand in hand.(2) As the Middle East Governments are among the largest ofour creditors our policy should be to give them wiseguidance in mobilising and spending their existing amplesterling resources by :(A) encouraging each of them to draw up itself its ownplan of economic development;(B) by offering to place at their disposal technical and specialist assistance to help them in formulatingtheir schemes; and(C) to steer their plans along lines in conformity with the limitations imposed on ourselves by our ownfinancial and supply situation and with the needsof the region as a whole.(3) Certain measures recommended by the Board of Trade for thestimulation of British commerce in the Middle East area should be adopted.(4) A start can best be made by placing qualified technical expertsat the disposal. of the Middle East Governments who require them. These experts should be attached to and operate as part of a British organisation located in Cairo.This British organisation should develop a scheme of regional technical conferences leading up to the eventualestablishment of a Middle East Development Board orCouncil composed of representatives of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and of the Governments of the variousterritories in the region. It would be the function of this board or Council to direct economic and social develop-ment along the lines of a coherent, co-ordinated, regionalplan.(g) Machinery for Regional Co-ordination of British Policy.(i) The Conference made recommendations on this subject which are contained in Part II of the Annex to this Memorandum,(ii) Summarised, they are : (1) The Conference took note of the decision of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to establish a Middle East Office in Cairo.(2) The Conference recommended the establishment of a &quot; BritishMiddle East Conference,&quot; as a standing committee composed of His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in the regionto co-ordinate and to formulate for consideration by HisMajesty&apos;s Government British policy in the region. TheConference would meet in Cairo as often as necessary andits secretariat would be provided by the British middle east Office.(3) The co-ordination and development of British policy in its economic aspects in the Middle East region should be a function of the British Middle East Office.
Foreign Office, 11th September, 1945.(h) Relations with the Arab League. The Arab League has not yet developedsufficient cohesion to warrant, even if it were desirable, its recognitionas a corporate body representative of the Arab States as a whole. Ithas, however, established an economic committee with the set purposeof achieving some co-ordination of economic policy among theconstituent members of the League. It will be inevitable that thereshould be informal political contacts with the League from time totime, and for this purpose the Conference agreed that, in existingcircumstances the focal point of such contacts should be His Majesty&apos;s embassy in Cairo. The Conference also agreed that in economic matters it was desirable, in existing circumstances, that the focal point should be the British Middle East Office. The practical difficulty,however, of drawing a nice line of distinction between matters&quot; political&quot; and matters &quot; economic &quot; will make it essential that the closest possible liaison should be maintained between the CairoEmbassy and the British Middle East Office on all questions affectingthe relationship of His Majesty&apos;s Government with the Arab League.E. B.
ANNEX.PART I.    -BRITISH ECONOMIC POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST.A. General.1. The raising of the standard of living of the masses of the people of theMiddle East will promote internal stability in the region, and increase its importance as a market for imported goods.2. British policy in the region, both in the general and economic fields,should therefore be shaped with that end in view.3. The existing mal-distribution of purchasing power in the Middle Eastcommunities is the greatest obstacle in the way of an improvement in thestandard of life of the masses. This obstacle can be removed only by action inthe political field on the part of the Governments concerned, directed towards,for example :  (a) Reform of the present system of land tenure (including rents), and improvement in wages and conditions of service in the agricultural industry.(&amp;) Reform of the existing systems of taxation, which, in general, fail to preserve a proper balance between direct and indirect taxation.(c) Social reform in the field of public health, labour legislation (includingconstitutional development of trade unionism), education (includingrural education in the widest sense of that term) and improvement ofthe civil services.4. Without measures of social reform on the above lines, economic develop-ment will do little more than put more money into the pockets of industrialistsand landed proprietors, and be largely a waste of capital and effort,5. It is important, therefore, that social reform should move forward stepby step with economic development,B. Financial Background.6. The extent to which British capital and equipment will be available toparticipate in a large-scale plan of economic development in the Middle Eastmust be considered against the following background which has been supplied to us by His Majesty&apos;s Treasury : (ja) The needs of the home market, both for capital and consumer goods,are enormous and cannot be denied. The first charge upon our exportsmust be the cost of imported food for our people and of the rawmaterials which we must have if our manufacturing industries areto be kept alive. The second charge upon our exporting capacitymust be, for many years to come, to make some contribution towardsthe liquidation of our overseas liabilities; these now exceed the vasttotal of  3,500 million sterling.(&amp;) We have pressing claims to help those worse off than ourselves U.N.R.R.A., Colonial development and rehabilitation, Greece andother Allies.(c) It will therefore be only in the most exceptional and compelling circum-stances that we shall be able to assume yet more charges on ourproductive capacity i.e., to grant credits to overseas borrowers.(d) The Middle East territories (except Saudi Arabia) are among the largestof our creditors. They already hold sterling exchange to an extentfar in excess of the amount needed to pay for any capital equipmentthat, over any reasonable period of time, they are likely to requireand that the industrial capacity of the United Kingdom is likely tobe able to provide.(e) The internal counter-value of the sterling balances held by these middle east territories is for the greater part in the hands of a wealthyminority in the communities; the capital needed for schemes of large-scale economic development can well be provided by the Middle East12919   [30517] B
territories themselves, either in the form of Government loans (whereGovernment is the authority promoting the schemes) or by subscriptionto companies or finance corporations (where development is left to private enterprise).(/) We must at present proceed on the assumption that the present dollarstringency in the Sterling Area is not likely to be relaxed for someyears to come.(g) The process of reconversion of British industry from war to peaceproduction cannot be accomplished otherwise than gradually; heavysimultaneous demands from a variety of sources upon our exportingcapacity during the next 12 to 18 months may lead to the disappoint-ment of our potential customers.7. With the foregoing considerations in mind, we must be careful, therefore,that, in adopting a policy of economic, development, we do not (a) Create a demand from the Middle East territories for the participation of British capital beyond our capacity.(b) Create a demand to spend the sterling balances more rapidly than wecould contemplate.(c) Create a demand that we should sell them gold or dollars which we havenot got, on the ground that if the United Kingdom cannot supply, ourcreditors should be enabled to go elsewhere (viz., to the United States).8. If we take an undue initiative in drawing up, and recommending to theMiddle East Governments, a plan of large-scale economic development, there isa danger that we may find ourselves in all of these embarrassments.9. It is suggested therefore that our policy should be to give the middle east Governments wise guidance in mobilising and spending their existing amplesterling resources and to this end (a) To encourage each of the Middle East Governments to draw up, itself,its own plan of economic development.(5) To offer to place at their disposal such technical and specialist assistance as they may require to formulate their schemes,(c) To steer their plans, particularly as regards timing, along lines that willbe in conformity with the limitations imposed on us by our ownfinancial and industrial situation, and that will take account of theneeds of the region as a whole.C. British Trade Interests.10. The fact that most of the Middle East economies have at their disposallarge balances in sterling (and are, at the same time, short Of dollars) in itselfgives British trade an initial advantage. If schemes of development are proposed and adopted, there should, therefore, be golden opportunities for the Britishexporter in the Middle East. The Board of Trade and the Department of Over-seas Trade have examined the immediate means which should be taken for the promotion of British trade in the region, and their recommendations are attached in a paper annexed as Appendix A.   Summarised, they are : (a) The strengthening of Commercial Diplomatic Posts.(b) The exchange of trade missions.(c) Increased travel facilities, including visas, priorities, &amp;c.(d) Restoration of Parcel Post Air Mail and improvement of existing AirMail facilities.(e) Increased facilities for visits by officials of London Departments.(/) The opening by British firms of regional offices in Cairo.(g) The encouragement of preliminary survey work by British firms of consulting engineers.Note. -The two objectives mentioned in (/) and (g) above wouldbe assisted (1) by relief from E.P.T. in respect of any expenditure incurred by British firms in activities of this nature and (2) by therelease of needed personnel from His Majesty&apos;s Forces.(h) The provision of British technical experts.(i) The speedy conclusion of a Treaty of Commerce and Establishment with egypt, and consideration of similar treaties with other Middle EastGovernments.
(j) Direct participation of British firms in local industries.(k) Representation in the Middle East of the Export Credits guarantee department.The Conference endorses these recommendations, and wishes to drawparticular attention to the necessity of adequate allowances to meet the high costof living in the Middle East. The Conference considers that as far as possiblepassport and visa formalities should be eased and that regard should be given tothe importance of cheap air travel facilities as an instrument for furtheringBritish commercial interests in the Middle East. Similarly the Conferenceconsiders that there should be an improvement of Air Mail facilities between theUnited Kingdom and the Middle East even if it does not provide a commensuratepostal revenue.D. Economic and Social Development in the Middle East.11. (1) The directions in which schemes of economic development can bestcontribute to the welfare of the common people of the Middle East can at thisstage be indicated only in broad general outline. They fall, however, into threebroad categories : (a) Schemes for the development of the agricultural industry, among whichmay be mentioned (i) irrigation;(ii) village development;(iii) afforestation;(iv) agricultural stations;(v) construction of roads;(vi) agricultural housing;(vii) improvement of strains of livestock and seed;(viii) veterinary services;(ix) fisheries;(x) promotion of rural education;(xi) anti-locust measures;(b) Schemes of industrial development;(c) The promotion of public works of a more general character.(2) In formulating any development programme of the kind, however, thefact should not be lost sight of that the economy of all the Middle East terri-tories is predominantly agricultural and that the development of, and ameliorationof conditions in, that industry should take first priority in the scheme.(3) At the same time care must be taken to preserve a balanced develop-ment and the claims of industrialisation must not be overlooked. It is, hoivever,important that the locall governments should be discouraged from- building upbehind high tariff walls industrial undertakings which, without this protection,would have no chance of survival in face of tvorld competition. Action in theinternational field would be the most effective, if not indeed the only, means ofcurbing tendencies of local governments in that direction.12. A wealth of detailed information on all of these subjects is available inthe reports of Professor Peers and Drs. Keen, Worthington, Allen and Wright,and we suggest as a first step that these reports should be examined in detail andif necessary supplemented by further surveys of the same kind in other fieldscarried out by investigators of the same calibre.13. Side by side with these measures of economic development the pro-motion of schemes of social betterment must go forward. In general outlinethese would include (i) better health services;(ii) improved educational systems;(iii) the constitutional development of Trade Unionism; and(iv) above all, a review of the present system of land tenure.14. With a programme of economic development and improvement of thesocial standards of the people of the Middle East of the kind adumbrated in thepreceding paragraphs, the question arises how best a contribution can be madeby His Majesty&apos;s Government to assist and guide the local governments along the desired lines.[30517] B 2
E.-Provision of Experts.15. (1) We have mentioned that the Middle East communities are amplyprovided with the financial resources to finance their development. What theyare short of is adequate technical and specialist personnel to assist them in formulating their schemes along the most economical and effective lines.(2) There has been a manifestation of a desire on the part of almost all local governments to obtain and employ specialists in these fields. It is clearly desirable in the political and commercial interests of the United Kingdom that wherever possible these experts should be British and that they should not be second-ratemen, but men of a calibre as good as can be obtained elsewhere. It would clearly be difficult and expensive to provide experts of the requisite standing for each government in the area. It would be less difficult and less expensive to maintain a &apos;&apos; nucleus &apos;&apos; of technicians attached to a central organisation available to be consulted by any of the local governments at need.(3) As a beginning the number of these technical experts would be small andshould cover the more important fields in which the schemes of development wouldbe likely to emerge, for example, agriculture, health, labour and general economics,public works, engineering and finance. These experts should not be. specialistsin any particular branch of their subjects. Each expert should, of course, have adequate professional qualifications in his own group of subjects, but need not be(and preferably should not be) an extreme specialist, for example, the chief expertin agriculture would not be expected himself to be a specialist in soil chemistry orin any of the other scientific branches of agriculture. He should be the type ofman capable of making a reliable appreciation of a technical problem or set of problems within bis general field, and of giving general advice on the lines oftheir treatment and able to put the authorities concerned in touch with the besttechnical assistance and resources obtainable in order to supplement his advice.(4) The experts would also be in touch with any related international organisations (e.g., the I.L.O. and the F.A.O.). Men of this type would also be best fitted to appreciate the technical problems of the region in relation to the wider economic picture and thus to contribute to the co-ordination of british policy in the area.16.-(1) The Ministry of War Transport have prepared a memorandum onthe subject of the provision of experts, which is attached to this report as appendix B. Summarised, it recommends that three main types of scientific andtechnical personnel should be envisaged :  (a) A small strategic unit attached to the Cairo Headquarters, but makingtours as necessary within the Middle East;(b) Personnel farmed out for a period to the service of local governments orother agencies; and(c) Experts who, owing to their greater eminence or their narrower specialism,would only be called out from the United Kingdom for short periodsas and when required:The Conference endorses these recommendations.(2) In the present situation of scarcity of experts of the kind contemplated,full use should be made of any resources which the Dominions, India and theColonial Service may be able to make available, particularly since many of the experts in those countries are likely to be familiar with conditions comparable with those of the Middle East. Moreover, Moslem susceptibilities might best bemet by recruitment from India.17. The nucleus of experts referred to above should be part of a BritishMiddle East organisation and operate from that base.F. Regional Technical Conferences.18. (1) While it would be a principal function of this British Middle Eastorganisation to arrange for the examination of surveys already undertaken, andfor fresh surveys to be conducted, we also envisage the organisation arrangingregional technical conferences on the subjects indicated by Drs. Worthington andKeen, and upon other subjects as opportunity offers.(2) The territories under British administration in the Middle East should participate in these conferences, as past experience has shown that they have muchto contribute as well as to gain; there is no reason why their participation should in any way affect the direct relationship between the administrations of such territories and the Departments to which they are responsible in London.
(3) These technical conferences should have as their objective the establish-ment of regional technical organisations in particular fields; possible lines of progress in this direction are particularly indicated in Dr. Worthington&apos;s Report.Such technical organisations should be related in due course to their internationalcounterparts, such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the Economicand Social Council of the United Nations Organisation. Some of them would need to cover an area wider than the Middle East : for example, the Anti-LocustOrganisation should include East Africa and India.G. Middle East Development Board or Council.19. By means of technical conferences of this character, the way would bepaved towards the formation of a Middle East Development Board or Council;but we suggest that this Council or Board should be framed on an advisory andconsultative rather than an executive basis, enshrining, nevertheless, the principleof partnership between the local Governments and His Majesty&apos;s Government.We feel that in present conditions Middle East inter-territorial rivalries are onlytoo likely to bring to failure any project along more ambitious lines. We must also be alive to the danger of establishing any organisation which would arousethe suspicions or hostility of the Americans.20. (1) A Council of this kind would not have the character of a publicutility or finance corporation; but would serve as the medium for inter-territorialexchange of information and experience. Under its aegis, projects for economic development could proceed on a territorial basis, backed by capital provided either by Governments or by private interests; but we see no reason to rule out the participation of British capital as soon as our financial position permitsMoreover, opportunities for British trade and enterprise are bound under thisscheme to arise through the close collaboration between British experts and interested parties in the Middle East. It would be of the essence of the scheme that every effort should be made to hold the balance, in a regional interest, betweenschemes promoted by individual territories, although we can have no assurance that any strict system of priorities which might be involved could be implementedby Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(2) It is important, in view of all the factors that we have mentioned, that further consideration should be given to the title of any body such as we have proposed.H. Machinery.21. The activities outlined above, which we suggest might provide the framework of a British economic policy in the Middle East, are, in our view,proper subjects for examination, development and co-ordination by a Britishorganisation located in Cairo- with responsibilities extending to all the territories in the Middle East region.PART II.REGIONAL CO-ORDINATION OF BRITISH POLICY IN THEMIDDLE EAST.I. Regional Aspects of British Policy.22. We have outlined in Part I of this Report the shape of a BritishEconomic Policy in the Middle East, and have proposed that this policy shouldbe developed and co-ordinated through a British regional organisation located in the Middle East.23. There are, however, certain other aspects of British policy in the region which, while presenting special features in individual territories, are essentially regional in their characteristics and elements, and are susceptibleof adequate treatment from the angle of His Majesty&apos;s Government only on a regional basis.   Among these are, in their economic aspects : (a) Oil.(&amp;) Civil&quot; Aviation.(c) Telecommunications.(d) American activities.(e) Russian activities.   (These, while manifesting themselves most activelyin Persia, are by no means confined to that territory.)24. While these questions (as well as the economic matters mentioned inPart I of this Report) must always be handled in a particular territory by
His Majesty&apos;s Representative in that territory, it is to the common advantage and in the best interest of His Majesty&apos;s Government that a regional approach should be devised, and that policies in one territory should not go forward in isolation and without regard to the circumstances of other territories or of the region as a whole.J. Meetings of His Majesty&apos;s Representatives.25. Consultation, discussion and exchange of views, at reasonably frequent intervals, among His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in the Middle East territoriesis, in our view, the best method of devising a common approach to these problems and of advising His Majesty&apos;s Government on questions of regional policy ingeneral.26. The occasional meetings of His Majesty&apos;s Representatives which havebeen held in Cairo during the years of the war, on the initiative of Mr. R. G. Casey(as Minister of State) and of Lord Altrincham (as Minister-Resident) have proved the value of regional consultation at that level.27. We therefore recommend that there should be meetings of His Majesty&apos;representatives in Middle East territories at least twice a year, and ad hoc as circumstances require.K. British Middle East Conference.28. We suggest that it should be a main function of these meetings toco-ordinate, and to formulate for consideration in London, British policy in the region (including the economic questions examined in Part I of this Report) and,with this function in mind, we would propose that these meetings warrantrecognition as an integral part of British organisation in the Middle East. Wetherefore suggest that they should be established in the form of a standingcommittee to be known, domestically, as &quot; The British Middle East Conference.&quot;29.   The Conference would be composed of :  (a) The Heads of His Majesty&apos;s Diplomatic Missions at Cairo, Baghdad,Beirut and Jedcla, and, as required, Tehran.(b) The High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan.(c) The Governors of Cyprus and Aden, as required.(d) The Commanders-in-Chief of the three Services in the Middle EastCommands.(e) The Head of the British Middle East Office (referred to- in Section Lbelow).30. (a) We would hope that it might be convenient for the Minister ofState or the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs to attend someof these conferences and to preside over them. Where this was not possible, wewould suggest that the senior among His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors should be chairman of the Conference.(5) The seat of the Conference should be Cairo as being the most convenientcentre in the area and by convention the regional capital.(c) The Conference should be convened by the Head of the Middle EastOffice, acting upon the authority of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.31. We would most strongly urge that senior representatives of the LondonDepartments should come out to Cairo and take part in the meetings of theConference. This would have the double advantage of keeping His Majesty&apos;representatives in touch with the general policy of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand of affording to the Home Departments a chance of informing themselves atfirst hand of conditions and tendencies in the Middle East.32. The Conference would require the services of a Secretariat, not only toarrange its periodical meetings, and to co-ordinate its documentation, but alsoto handle, in the intervals between its meetings, day-to-day matters arising outof, or in connection with, the questions with which the Conference would be concerned.33. The proposals in this Section are not intended to preclude meetings ona less formal basis of His Majesty&apos;s Representatives, either in Cairo or else wherein the region.
L. British Middle East Office.Functions of British Middle East Office.34. (a) His Majesty&apos;s Government have already publicly announced their intention of establishing in Cairo a British Middle East Office, to carry on certain of the functions formerly discharged by the Office of the minister resident. It seems to us to be appropriate that this Office should also handle the development and co-ordination along regional lines of the British economic policy outlined in Part I of this Report. We suggest that this Office shouldconstitute, also, the Secretariat of the British Middle East Conference.(&amp;) We also recommend that meetings should be held in Cairo from time totime of representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Embassies and Legations and of theBritish-Administered Territories, at a lower level than those proposed inSection K. The Commercial Secretaries, for example, might meet from time totime with advantage. These meetings we suggest should be convened by, and held under the chairmanship of the Head of the British Middle East Office.Relationship with Diplomatic Missions.35. It would be essential that no feature of this plan for co-ordinatingBritish policy on a regional basis, and no assignment of function to the BritishMiddle East Office, should interfere with the responsibility of His Majesty&apos;sDiplomatic Mission in a particular territory for representing to the Governmentto which if was accredited the views and policies of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Approaches to the independent territorial Governments would therefore be madeeither through, or with the acquiescence of, the Mission concerned.36. The correct relationship that we have in mind between the BritishMiddle East Office and His Majesty&apos;s Missions could, we think, best be establishedby appointing the Head of the Office as a member of the staff of each of theMissions in the region in the capacity of a Minister (Economic) or Counsellor(Economic), his rank in a particular case depending on the status of the Missionconcerned. Such an arrangement would make it clear that territorial questions(and the territorial aspects of regional questions) fell unequivocally within thescope of the Head of the Mission, through whom representations would be madeto the territorial Government and also to the Foreign Office.37. The British Middle East Office (by virtue of its function as secretariat of the Middle East Conference) would communicate direct with the ForeignOffice. The Office would also communicate direct with the Foreign Office and,through the Foreign Office, with other Departments in London on questions ofa regional character arising out of its day-to-day work. Similar considerations would govern communications from the Foreign Office (and other London Depart-ments) to the British Middle East Office.38. The channel of communication should be through the Cairo Embassy,as for the Office of the Minister Resident at present.39. Much of the success of the plan proposed would depend upon themaintenance of a close liaison, in both directions, between, on the one hand, HisMajesty&apos;s Diplomatic Missions and the Governments of British-AdministeredTerritories in the Middle East, and, on the other, the British Middle EastOffice. Arrangements should therefore be made for telegrams to be repeatedand despatches to be copied, in both directions. As well, the Foreign office should keep the British Middle East Office informed in the same way on all questions likely to affect the regional aspects of the work of the Office.40. It will not always be practicable, because of expense or because ofscarcity of qualified personnel, to attach to each of His Majesty&apos;s Missions inthe Middle East, on a full-time basis, an officer capable of giving specialisedadvice in the fields referred to in Section I of this part of the Report. Therequirements of the Missions can, we suggest, best be met by arranging that anadequate corps of experts is maintained on the staff of the Middle East Officeupon whose services all of the Missions would be entitled to draw at need.41. Such an arrangement would not exclude the appointment to any mission of an Attache specialising in a particular subject (e.g., finance, labour,agriculture or civil aviation) if the duties arising at a particular Mission justifieda full-time appointment. The sphere of operations of this Attache would,however, be confined to the territory to which his Mission was accredited andwould not extend to other parts of the region.
Status of British Middle East Office.42. It is proposed that the British Middle East Office should be established in Cairo. Egypt is an independent territory. It is clearly necessary, in viewof the functions which the Office would discharge, that its office premises, archivesand staff should have a degree of &quot;immunity.&quot; This would be secured if theOffice were afforded either (a\ diplomatic immunity or (&amp;) military immunity(the Office of the Minister Resident is regarded as part of G.H.Q., Middle East,and, in that guise, has up till now enjoyed the military immunities of theAnglo-Egyptian Treaty).43. The changed circumstances, and the alteration in function nowproposed for the British Middle East Office, make it scarcely appropriate thatit should operate as a &quot; para-military &quot; organisation. It is suggested, therefore,that the Office should have diplomatic immunity. This could be secured only by giving the Office the &apos;&apos; cover &apos;&apos; of the Embassy, and it is proposed that thisshould be done. The Head of the Office would, in Egypt, be a member of thestaff of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador with, as we have proposed, the title of Minister(Economic). The members of the staff of the Office could be accorded similar&quot; cover &quot; in the same way and to the same extent as the staff of the Embassy itself.44. In the other Middle East independent territories the Head of theBritish Middle East Office, in the quality of Minister or Counsellor (Economic), and a very small number of his senior staff whose duties might require them to pay regular visits to the various territories, could be similarly attached as members of the staff of each of the Missions.45. An arrangement of this kind would ensure that the British Middle EastOffice stood in a similar relationship to all His Majesty&apos;s Missions in the middle east.Relationships with Governments of British-Administered Territories.46. This should present no problem. There would be no direct official com-munication between the Office and the Colonial Office or the War Office, withwhich the Governments of British-Administered Territories would deal direct, as hitherto, on all territorial questions. A close liaison on regional questions couldbe maintained between the Office and the Governments concerned.Staff, of British Middle East Office.47. The staff and internal organisation of the British Middle East office would depend upon the functions assigned to it; and we leave these to be deter-mined, in the light of those functions, by the appropriate authorities.M. Co-ordination of Middle East Policy in London.48. It appears to be the general view that the success of any attempt atco-ordination of British policy by a body located in the Middle East itself must depend upon adequate arrangements for co-ordination at the centre in London.The Conference takes note of a paper on this subject prepared by the Ministryof War Transport annexed to this Report as Appendix C. It is important, in ourview, that whatever committee or committees are set up in London to deal withMiddle Eastern Affairs should be so constituted as to ensure that prompt and authoritative directions and decisions are given to all the establishments main-tained by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Middle East The Conference has nocompetence to decide by which method this objective should be achieved.49. A co-ordinating body of this character will require a permanentSecretariat; and we envisage that the normal channel of communication on regional questions will be between the Secretariat of the Middle East Com-mittee in London (through the Foreign Office and in the name of the Secretary ofState) and the British Middle East Office in Cairo.N. Miscellaneous.Middle East Defence Committee.50. We recommend that the Middle East Defence Committee shouldcontinue in being, and that the Head of the British Middle East Office should actas its Chairman.
Political Advice for the Commanders-in-Chief.51. While we see no objection to the Commanders-in-Chief being kept informed by the British Middle East Office on current political and economic developments throughout the region, on the basis of telegrams and despatchesreceived from His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in the various territories and fromother official sources, we feel that it should be to His Majesty&apos;s Representatives ineach territory that the Commanders-in-Chief should look for advice and guidancewith regard to the political situation and tendencies in that territory, and that military action in a particular territory should be undertaken only after consulta-tion with His Majesty&apos;s Representative in that territory. We do not regard it as desirable that an official should be attached to any of the Commanders-in-Chief inthe capacity of a &quot; Political Adviser,&quot; nor, we understand, do the Commanders-in-Chief desire an arrangement of that kind.APPENDIX A.IMMEDIATE MEASURES FOR THE PROMOTION OF BRITISH TRADEIN THE MIDDLE EAST.Memorandum by the Board of Trade and the Department of Overseas Trade.1. Strengthening of Commercial Diplomatic Posts.Almost all the Middle East posts are at present under-staffed and willrequire substantial reinforcement if they are to be able to cope with the flow ofnew work which must be expected with the dissolution of the Middle East SupplyCentre, the reopening of trade and the orderly disposal of military surpluses withthe minimum of interference with our exports. The importance of providing additional staff is fully recognised and what can be clone with the presentextremely limited man-power is already in hand. Special arrangements have alsobeen made by the Treasury and Department of Overseas Trade to enable posts to engage local assistance on a temporary basis. In attempting to recruit this staff,however, we are hampered by two particular difficulties :  (a) New staff over 30 can be engaged only on a very temporary basis, whichis quite unattractive to the right type of man.(b) Allowances in Middle East countries have not kept pace with the costof living so that candidates without private means are discouragedfrom accepting appointments.The problem of strengthening our Commercial Diplomatic posts is, of course,a general one and the Middle East position cannot be considered in isolation.The new staff in sight over the next nine months is limited and there are manycompeting claims for it from our missions all over the world.2. Trade Missions.It is planned to send a Goodwill Mission to Egypt, probably towards the endof November. Mr. Hanbury-Williams, Deputy Chairman of Courtaulds and a director of the Bank of England, has agreed to lead it. It is hoped that the samemission (or, at least, some individual members of it) will go on to visit otherMiddle Eastern countries, including Palestine, Cyprus, Syria and the Lebanonand Iraq. The alternative of sending separate missions to these countries hasbeen dismissed owing to the difficulty of finding the right personnel for a numberof missions.The Mission will not be a selling mission; its function will be to prepare theground, by a convincing display of the interest of the United Kingdom industryin the Middle East, for the visits of the sales representatives of individual firms who will follow on its heels. It is suggested that the Mission might be sponsored by the F.B.I. It would.not be sent as from His Majesty&apos;s Government, but itwould be made clear that it had the full support of the Government.Arab and Jewish trade missions from Palestine have already visited theUnited Kingdom, and it is hoped that missions from other countries will return the visit to be made by the British Mission.[30517] c
3. Increased Travel Facilities.It is most important that better facilities (including visas, priorities, &amp;c.) beprovided for visits in both directions by responsible business men. At presentformalities for the average traveller are lengthy and available transport both by sea and air is inadequate to meet the demand.4. Restoration of Parcel Post Airmail.This is much needed to provide a rapid means of transport for samples,engineering drawings, survey instruments, &amp;c. The Post Office are pressing for arestoration of services, but have been held up by shortage of transport aircraft.Improvement of ordinary Air Mail facilities is also important.5. Increased Facilities&apos;for Visits by Officials of London Departments.More frequent visits by officials of Home Departments are most desirable, both from the point of view of the Home Departments themselves, who should keep inclose touch with local developments, and.from that of the local officials who shouldbe more regularly informed of the trend of home policy. At present, visits areseverely limited by shortage of man-power, but the position in this respect should now begin to improve. Similarly, we should continue to encourage frequent visitshome by officials in the Middle East for consultation.6. Branch Offices.British firms are being advised and encouraged to open area offices in Cairo to supervise their Middle East interests, and to appoint a local director with powerto take decisions. Export Groups and similar trade organisations are beingadvised to open offices in Cairo for co-operative work on behalf of their members.Some, e.g., the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the TextileMachinery Manufacturers, have already done sc. Action on these lines is likelyto have more direct practical results than the opening of &quot; Britannia Houses.&quot;7.Every effort is being made to encourage British firms of consulting engineers to undertake preliminary survey work for important contracts in thehope that this will lead to the contracts themselves being placed in this country.8.: .Particular importance is attached to the provision of British technical advisers, but this question is being dealt with in another context.9. Establishment Conditions.In Egypt conditions of residence and establishment for British subjects are far from satisfactory and such limited treaty protection as we now possess will be lost when the Montreux Convention lapses in 1949. It is most important thatthis should be remedied and a new draft Treaty of Commerce and Establishmentis being drawn up for that purpose. It has still to be submitted to Ministers herebut, subject to ministerial approval, we hope to be in a position to begin negotia-tions with Egypt in November. It may be that at a later date similar treaties willbe required with some of the other Middle East countries.10.A number of important British firms have already engaged in negotia-tion, particularly in Egypt, for direct participation in local industries inconjunction with local firms. Although the opportunities of business are con-sidered good, little solid progress has yet been made owing to the threat of restrictive nationalist legislation, e.g., &quot;the proposed Egyptian Company Law.Success in this field depends mainly, upon the extent of our success in divertingthe nationalistic feeling behind these tendencies into more fruitful channels.11.The Export Credits Guarantee Department have had a representativetouring the Middle East in order to arrange if possible for local departmentalrepresentation. Any person appointed would, of course, work in close collabora-tion with the Embassies concerned. There is no doubt that much work needs tobe done on bringing our status information up to date.12.Restrictions over exports to the Middle East, both at the importing andat the exporting end, are being relaxed as rapidly as conditions permit.
APPENDIX B.PROVISION OF EXPERTS.Note by the Ministry of War Transport.It cannot be too strongly emphasised that the proposed policy of economicand social development in the Middle East can only succeed if it is based on anadequate supply of first-rate scientific and technical advice. First-rate scientific and technical men are in extremely short supply, and so far as British subjectsare concerned their services are urgently needed in many other directions. It istherefore essential that machinery should be created for obtaining and using their services with the utmost efficiency and economy. There is no machinery atpresent in view which is adapted for this purpose. Even to make contact withthe wide range of specialists who will at one time or another be required is a formidable task calling for a specially qualified establishment officer with a goodknowledge of the scientific and technical field, and with excellent personalcontacts. After contact has been made the problem of persuading experts to serve in the Middle East is considerable. Even assuming that local Governments(e.g., Iraq) are prepared to offer really adequate salaries, comparatively few goodmen will throw up or forgo other employment in order to take a relatively short-term contract with the prospect of getting out of touch with their own field andfinding themselves in a blind alley. If satisfactory results are to be obtainedit will probably be necessary to arrange for the Middle East Office to act as an intermediary in many cases and for its London representatives to arrange notonly with the expert in question but with his employer (whether that is a university or industrial firm or a research station) for a loan or transfer of services for, say, six months, a year or even two or more years, according to conditions.It will be essential to be able to safeguard pension rights, &amp;c, if valuable menwho are willing to serve are not to be lost. In general it seems desirable thatas large a proportion as possible of the experts sent out should retain their statuswith their previous employers so that new blood can be readily introduced, andthe effects of climate and working conditions on health counteracted by a short period of service in the field. It also seems desirable that both non-British local governments and any regional or international agencies which may be set upin the Middle East should look to the British Middle East Office for at least partof their British scientific and technical staff, who could be seconded to these tasksas Wing-Commander Skilbeck to the embryo Middle East Council of Agriculture.It will also greatly improve the attractions of the Middle East as a field of service and the speed with which we can progress if frequent opportunitiesare afforded for journeys home to consult, and if the proposals of Drs. Keen andWorthington for the provision of technical information (e.g., by the ImperialBureaux) are fully implemented. The existence of an adequate scientific andtechnical element in the London Secretariat, backed by a really strong committeeof scientific and technical men with Middle East experience, will also assist in getting prompt and effective attention to requests for help from the experts whoare sent out, and this again will encourage good men to serve, and by enabling them to do their task more quickly will reduce the strain on man-power which isalso heavy elsewhere.It is recommended that three main types of scientific and technical personnelshould be envisaged : (a) The small strategic unit attached to Cairo Headquarters, but makingtours as necessary within the Middle East;(b) Personnel farmed out for a period to the service of local governments or other agencies; and(c) Experts who owing to their greater eminence or their narrower specialismwould only be called out from the United Kingdom for short periodsas and when required.It is submitted that the effective handling of this problem will form one ofthe most vital elements in the success of any development policy in the middle east.
LONDON ARRANGEMENTS FOR DEALING WITH MIDDLE EASTPROBLEMS.Note by the Supply Section for the Middle East of the Ministry of war transport.1. Successive Resident Ministers, Commanders-in-Chief and officialsresponsible for affairs in the Middle East have emphasised the discouragementand paralysis of effort which results if requests to London for guidance, help and advice on policy and general matters are not handled with a promptitudeand effectiveness beyond the capacity of the complex Departments now concerned.-   2.   Among proposals put forward for overcoming this fundamental weaknessat the London end have been (a) appointment of a Minister for Middle East affairs attached to theForeign Office;(b) appointment of a Middle East Ministerial Committee;(c) appointment of a new Middle East Official Committee with a strongchairman;(d) creation of a Middle East Department within the  Foreign Officeresponsible for all His Majesty&apos;s Government^ political and aclminis-trative relations with Middle East territories including those atpresent responsible to the Colonial Office. This is proposed by LordAltrincham in paragraph 24 of his Memorandum; and(e) creation of a strong London secretariat acting on behalf of all Depart-ments concerned with economic and technical aspects on the model ofthe Supply Section for the Middle East in the Ministry of war transport which has served as the London secretariat of the middle east Supply Centre. This raises the question whether such a secretariatshould be located in the Foreign Office or in the Cabinet Office.3.   These proposals point clearly to the two outstanding needs which are :  (a) a sufficiently high level and authoritative channel for giving (or where necessary obtaining from the Cabinet) decisions on matters of middle eastern policy; and(&amp;) a staff of adequate quality and scale in London giving their whole time and attention to Middle East problems from a regional stand-point, more particularly on economic and technical matters.To some extent 2 (a) and 2 (b) are alternative ways of meeting the first ofthese needs and 2 id) and 2 (e) of meeting the second although none of these courses are mutually exclusive. 2 (c) (the Official Committee) is by commonconsent necessary in any case.4. If there is not to be a special Minister for the Middle East either resident in the region or in London a Cabinet Committee for the Middle East will be highly desirable if not essential in order to co-ordinate policy over the whole field.Equally the scope of the policies now under discussion makes it quite clear thatif Lord Altrincham&apos;s more drastic proposal for an amalgamated Middle EastDepartment is not adopted forthwith the absolute minimum requirement for avoiding a breakdown is the creation of a really strong secretariat in London todo for the new Middle East Office at least as much as the Supply Section for theMiddle East has done for M.E.S.C. As an indication of scale, S.S.M.E. hasrequired about the half-time services of an energetic Assistant Secretary and thewholetime of two or three Principals and the equivalent of three of four AssistantPrincipals with the necessary general staff. In the absence of some comparableestablishment of really high quality experience shows that the many and exactingneeds of a vigorous British Staff in the Middle East cannot be satisfied.5. There are nowr or will shortly be in England several ex-officials whohave great experience in problems of Middle East development; there are alsoProfessor Peers and Drs. Keen and Worthington, whose reports are a &quot; bible &quot;for Middle East Development, and others. It is recommended that these men should be invited to join an advisory committee or panel and that it should bethe business of a qualified member of the London Middle East Office or Secretariatto see that their advice is sought in all appropriate cases.
