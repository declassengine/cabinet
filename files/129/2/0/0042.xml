Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 192.25th September, 1945.CABINET.JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.AFTER consultation and in agreement with the Home Secretary, the Secre-tary of State for Scotland, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the attorney-General I have come&apos; to the conclusion that an Inquiry by a RoyalCommission into the selection and removal of Justices of the Peace and certain other aspects of the administration of Summary Jurisdiction is urgently required.2 The Royal Commission on the selection of Justices of the Peace (1911,Cmd. 5250, copy attached) made recommendations that were carried out adminis-tratively by the setting up of local Committees to submit names and to advise theLord Chancellor and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The aim shouldbe to secure a proper selection of Justices representative of different classes of society and of different professions and occupations. There is a tendency forthis to be interpreted as meaning that there should be a balance of party nominees,with members of the Advisory Committee considering themselves as delegates oftheir political parties, and it is not unknown for there to be agreements between two parties to exclude persons of a third party or those of no party. Activity inparty politics must not be regarded either as a bar to appointment as a justice of the Peace, or as a qualification or reward for political services. I am satisfiedthat the present system is not working satisfactorily, but I consider that it wouldbe inexpedient to introduce changes except with the backing of the Report of aCommission of Inquiry.3. It is also necessary to ensure that Justices of the Peace do not remain on the bench when from age, infirmity or unsuitability they are incapable ofefficiently administering justice. I also regret to say that I have received information which makes me uneasy whether in certain areas bias and corruptiondo not exist. The public conscience has been stirred by certain cases which haverecently been the subject of individual investigation and notably by thatconducted by Lord Goddard at Stoke-on-Trent known as the &quot; Longton case.&quot;4. I do not think that it is necessary or desirable that a Royal commission should investigate&quot; the whole field of Summary Jurisdiction. In particular, Ishould deprecate any suggestion that the Government think that there are prima facie grounds for considering the abandonment of the present system of layjustices and substituting for it some other system. It would be better, in my view, to make it clear that the purpose of the Inquiry is to consider how to makethe existing system more efficient. Nor do I think that the Royal commission should be asked to say whether there should be changes in the functions exercised by the Lord Chancellor, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the HomeSecretary, and the Secretary of State for Scotland respectively, in relation tomagistrates, since the organisation of the machinery of Government is a matter for the Cabinet.5. A number of matters concerning Summary Jurisdiction have been examined and reported upon by the Departmental Committee on Justices&apos; Clerks(1914, Cmd. 6507) under the Chairmanship of Lord Roche, and further inquiry into this field is not needed.6.   I think that the Inquiry should be restricted to those urgent and out-standing questions upon which a Royal Commission may be expected to produce a speedy and unanimous Report.   The main purpose of the Inquiry should be to review once again in the light of modern conditions the problems, procedure and[30590]Copy No.
practices examined in 1911 relating to the selection, appointment, &amp;c. of Justices,and to see how far the solutions and remedies then proposed are satisfactory and effective and to what extent they need strengthening or. modification in the changed circumstances of 1945. In addition, there are some allied questions that it wouldbe helpful to refer specifically to the Royal Commission.7. I attach to this Memorandum an Annex containing draft Terms ofReference for the proposed Royal Commission which have been agreed with theHome Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.8. The composition of the suggested Royal Commission will need very careful consideration, as it is imperative that its members should commandpublic confidence and respect. The Royal Commission of 1911 was composedof Lord James of Hereford and fifteen other persons whose names were honouredthroughout the land and included eminent representatives of the political parties.On this occasion there is much to be said for a smaller body of (say) five to tenpersons inclusive of the Chairman, who, I think, should (like Lord James ofHereford) have judicial qualifications of the highest distinction.9.   I recommend the Cabinet -(a) To approve the proposal that a Royal Commission should be established as soon as practicable to consider how best the existing system of layjustices can be made more efficient;(&amp;) That the draft Terms of Reference attached hereto should be the RoyalCommission^ Terms of Reference; .(c) To authorise me to consult with the Home Secretary and other ministers directly concerned as to the names of a Chairman and other membersof the Royal Commission and to report thereon to the Cabinet in dueOVUi oc.JOWITT, C.House of Lords, S.W. 1,25th September, 1945.ANNEX.Draft Terms of Reference.TO review the present arrangements for the selection and removal of justices of the Peace, and to report what changes, if any, in that system are necessary or desirable to ensure that only the most suitable persons are appointed to theCommission of the Peace.2.

REPORT.TO THE KING&apos;S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY.May it Please Your Majesty,We, the undersigned Commissioners appointed to consider and report whether any and what steps should be taken to facilitate the selection of the most suitable persons to be Justices of the Peace, irrespective of creed and political, opinion,humbly beg to submit to Your Majesty our Report and the evidence upon whichit is based.Our first sitting took place on the 24th November 1909, since which date wehave held 15 sittings for the purpose of taking evidence. At such sittings weexamined 56 witnesses and considered various documents submitted to us.The Office of Justice of the Peace.The office of Justice of the Peace dates from the 14th century. Indeed&quot;Conservators&quot; or &quot;Keepers of the Peace&quot; were recognised at an earlierperiod. &quot; The common law,&quot; says Blackstone, &quot; hath ever had a special care and&quot; regard for the conservation of the peace; for, peace is the very end and&quot; foundation of civil society. And, therefore, before the present constitution of&quot; Justices was invented, there were peculiar officers appointed by the common law&quot; for the maintenance of the public peace. Of these some had, and still have,&quot; this power annexed to other offices which they hold; others had it merely by&quot; itself, and were thence named Custodes or Conservatores Pacis. Those that&quot; were so virtute officii still continue, but the latter sort are superseded by&quot; the modern Justices.&quot; 1High Officers of State, such as the&apos; Lord Chancellor, the Master of the Rolls,the other Judges in their own courts, and Sheriffs within their own counties wereamong those entrusted with the duty of maintaining the peace as an incident totheir offices.Prior to the year 1327 those who were Keepers of the Peace otherwise than by virtue of their office &quot; either claimed that power by prescription, or were bound to&quot; exercise it by the tenure of their lands; or, lastly, were chosen by the freeholders&quot; in full county court before the Sheriff.&quot; 2 But-in that year popular election ofKeepers of the Peace was superseded by the King&apos;s Commission.According to Blackstone &quot; when Queen Isabel, the wife of Edward II., had&quot; contrived to depose her husband by a forced resignation of the crown and had set&quot; up his son, Edward III., in his place ..... To prevent therefore any&quot; risings, or other disturbance of the peace, the new King sent writs to all the&quot; Sheriffs in England . . . . . withal commanding each Sheriff that the&quot; peace be kept throughout his bailiwick, on pain and peril of disinheritance and&quot; loss of life and limb. And in a few weeks after the date of these writs, it&quot; was ordained in Parliament, that, for the better maintaining and keeping of&quot; the peace in every county, good men and lawful, which were no maintainers to&quot; evil, or barretors in the country, should be assigned to keep the peace. And in&quot; this manner and upon this occasion, was the election of the Conservators of the&quot; Peace taken from the people and given to the King; this assignment being&quot; construed to be by the King&apos;s Commission.&quot; 3 0The Statute of 1327 &quot;(1 Edward III., S. 2. c. 16), is thus regarded byBlackstone, following Lambard, as originating the modern system of appointmentof Justices of the Peace.In 1344, by the Statute 18 Edward III., c. 2 it was definitely enacted that theKeepers of the Peace were to be appointed by the King&apos;s Commission; and in 1360the Statute 34 Edward III. c. 1 gave the Keepers of the Peace the power of tryingfelonies,.&quot; and then they acquired the more honourable appellation of Justices.&quot; *1 Blackstone&apos;s Commentaries, 2lst Edition, Vol. I. p. 348.     2 Ibid. p. 349.       3 Ibid. pp. 349-350.4 Ibid. p. 350.A3ROYAL COMMISSION ON THE SELECTION OF JUSTICES OFTHE  PEACE.
ROYAL COMMISSION ON THE SELECTION OF JUSTICES OF THE PEACE:

It would appear that, notwithstanding the assertion in the Act of 1344 of the royal prerogative of appointing Justices, some of the great nobles, claiming to exercise almost regal powers in their counties palatine, had appointed Justices in their own names. The preamble of the Statute 27 Henry VIII. c. 24 recites that-

"dyvers of the moost auncient prerogatives and auctorities of justices "apparteynyng to (the impall) crowne of this realme have ben severed and taken "frome the same by sondrye giftes of the Kinges moost noble progenitours Kinges "of this realme, to the greate dymynucion and detriment of the roiall estate of "the same and to the hynderaunce and greate delaye of justice."

Accordingly it was expressly enacted by this statute "that no personne or "personnes of what estate degree or condicion soever they be, frome the said first "daye of Julye (1536), shall have any power or auctoritie to make any justices of "eire justices of assise (justice) of peace or justices of gaole delyverey but that all "suche officers and ministers shalbe made by letters patentes under the Kinges "greate seale in the name and by auctoritie of the Kinges Highnes his heires, "Kynges of this realme, in all shires counties counties palantyne any other places "of this realme Wales and marches of the same, or in any other his domynyons "at thir pleasour and willes, in suche maner and forme as justices of eire justices "of assise justices of peace and justices of gaole delyverey be comonly made in "every shire of this realme."

In the case of the county palatine of Lancaster, however, it was provided by section 4 of the Act (27 Henry VIII. c. 24) that commissions to justices should be "under the Kinges usuall seall of Lancastre" instead of under the Great Seal.

The Statute 2 Henry V. c. 1 enacted that Justices of the Peace must be resident in their several counties, but apart from this no qualifications for appointment to the office, except general directions that they should be men "of "the best reputation and most worthy men in the county" or "of the most "sufficient knights, esquires, and gentlemen of the law," were prescribed by the statutes until the 18 Henry VI. c. 11, which enacted that no Justice should be put on the Commission if he had not lands to the value of 20l. per annum. This qualification was raised by the Statute 5 Geo. II. c. 11 to one of 100l. per annum and by 18 Geo. II. c. 20 it was provided that every Justice of the Peace must have in possession either in law or equity, for his own use and benefit, a freehold, copyhold, or customary estate, for life, or for some greater estate, or an estate for some long term of years, determinable upon one or more life or lives, or for a certain term originally created for 21 years or more in lands, tenements, or hereditaments, in England or Wales, of the clear yearly value of 100l. above all incumbrances, &amp;c., or else must be entitled to the immediate reversion or remainder of, and in such lands, &amp;c.; leased for one or more lives, or for a term determinable on the death of one or more lives, upon reserved rents of the yearly value of 300l.

The Act of 1875, 38 &amp; 39 Viet. c. 54, modified this qualification by admitting as eligible for appointment persons owning leaseholds and living in the county in a house rated at more than 100l. a year.

Finally, in 1906, by the Statute 6 Edward VII. c. 16, the property qualification was abolished altogether. It is to be observed that this property qualification applied only to English and Welsh county justices.

Many of the boroughs in former times enjoyed under ancient charters or by prescription the right of appointing their own Justices and holding Courts of Quarter Sessions. Section 5 of the Statute of 27 Henry VIII referred to above expressly provided that "all cities boroughes and townes corporate within this "realme which hath libertie power and auctoritie to have justices of peace or "justices of gaole delyverey still have and enjoy thir liberties and auctorities in "that behalff after such like maner as they have ben accustomed, without any "alteration by occasion of this Acte; any thing in this Acte or in any article "therein conteyned to the contrarie thereof notwithstanding."

Most of these ancient privileges were abolished by the Municipal Corporations Act, 1835, and the remainder disappeared under the Municipal Corporations Act, 1883. But the Act of 1835 provided that the Crown, on the petition of the council of the borough, might grant to any borough a separate Commission of the Peace, and also a separate Court of Quarter Sessions.


repokt. oEx-officio Justices of the Peace.The Municipal Corporations Act, 1835, provided that the Mayor of everyMunicipal Borough should be an ex-officio Magistrate in the Borough during hisyear of office and for the succeeding year. This provision was continued by the municipal Corporations Act, 1882. By the Local Government Acts, 1888 and1894, the Chairmen of County Councils and of District Councils are also justices of the Peace during their term of office.Form of Commission.Justices of the Peace are, as we have seen, appointed by a Special commission under the Great Seal, except in Lancashire, where they are appointed under theSeal of the Duchy. The old form of Commission which was settled by all the judges in 1590 appointed all the Justices jointly and separately to keep thepeace, &apos;&apos; and any two or more of them to enquire of and determine felonies and&quot; other misdemeanours : in which number some particular Justices, or one of&quot; them, are directed to be always included, and no business to be done without&quot; their presence, the words of the Commission running thus : &apos; quorum aliquem&quot; &apos; vestrum A., B., C, D., etc., unum esse volumus,&apos; whence the persons so named&quot; are usually called Justices of the Quorum. And formerly it was customary&quot; to appoint only a select number of Justices, eminent for their skill and dis-&quot; cretion, to be of the quorum; but now the practice is to advance almost all&quot; of them to that dignity, naming them all over again in the quorum clause&quot; except, perhaps, only some one inconsiderable person for the sake of propriety;&quot; and no exception is now allowable for not expressing in the form of warrants,I   &quot; &amp;o, that the Justice who issued them is of the quorum.&quot; 1The practice of appointing Justices of the Quorum which was virtually!   obsolete in Blackstone&apos;s time is now entirely so.The old form, however, remained unaltered until 1878, when, under the rulesmade in pursuance of the Crown Office Act, 1877, a common form was prescribedfor Commissioners of the Peace under the Great Seal for counties in England andI  Wales, and also for boroughs in England and Wales.The County Commission is addressed to the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Presi-dent of the Council, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, the several Members of!  the Privy Council, the Lord Lieutenant, the Lord Chief Justice, and other  Judges of the High Court, to the Attorney and Solicitor-General for the timebeing, and to the persons named in the Schedule annexed to the Commission.The Borough Commission is addressed to the Mayor of the Borough and thepersons named in the Schedule.IOn appointment of new Justices the practice is not to issue a new Com-mission, but merely to add the names of the new Justices to the Schedule until theCommission becomes unwieldly or contains the names of an unusually large numberof dead persons.Sessions of Justices of the Peace.The Sessions of Justices of the Peace are of two kinds (1) General Sessionsand General Quarter Sessions; and (2) Petty Sessions and Special Sessions.General Quarter Sessions are those which are held in the four quarters of theI year in pursuance of the Statute of 2 Henry V. c. 4, and later Acts, and general  Sessions are other Sessions held at any other time for the general execution ofthe authority of Justices of the Peace which by the above-mentioned Statute theyare authorised to hold oftener than at the times therein specified.The term Petty Sessions is given to a Session of two or more Justices meetingat regular intervals or fixed times for the purpose of attending to various matters which by Statute they are required to do out of Quarter Sessions.Special Sessions is the name given to Petty Sessions held to transact certain! business of which special notice has to be given beforehand.Whereas the Court of Quarter Sessions is a Court of Sessions of the Peacefor the whole county, the jurisdiction of Petty Sessions is in practice confined tothe particular Petty Sessional division, and though the Justices are Justices ofthe Peace for the whole county, by custom they attend only the Petty Sessions ofthe division to which they are attached.1 Blackstone&apos;s Commentaries, Vol. I., p. 350.
1 Simpson, Minutes of Evidence, Q. 409, p. 24. * Loreburn, Q. 243, p. 11.Petty Sessional divisions were constituted by the Statute 9 Geo. IV. c. 43,which authorised the Justices at Quarter Sessions to divide the county into PettySessional districts.It may be mentioned that the total number of districts in England and Walesfor which Courts of - Summary Jurisdiction. are established is 1,001, viz., 750Petty Sessional Divisions of Counties and Liberties, and 251 Boroughs havingseparate Commissions. The City of London and the Liberty of Eomney Marshhave Justices appointed otherwise than by Commission. In the 14 MetropolitanPolice Court Districts there are 25 Police Magistrates; and in 14 Boroughs and in  other areas there are 20 Stipendiary Magistrates.There are 61 Courts of Quarter Sessions for Counties and Liberties, and 103Boroughs have separate Courts of Quarter Sessions.Powers and Duties of Justices of the Peace.The power, office, and duties of a Justice of the Peace depend on his commis-sion and on the several Statutes which have created objects of his jurisdiction.His primary duty is to keep the peace.This term &quot; covers such matters as swearing in members of the county and&quot; borough police forces, and appointing special constables when a disturbance&quot; of the peace is likely to occur; taking necessary measures to suppress actual&quot; riot; taking sureties for good behaviour from persons from whom there is reason&quot; to apprehend violence; and ensuring that persons suspected of crime are brought&quot; to Justice.&quot; 1Secondly, the Justices assembled in Quarter Sessions are empowered to try and determine felonies and misdemeanours committed in their county, providedthat the more serious cases are reserved for the Judges of Assize.Thirdly, Justices sitting as a Court of Summary Jurisdiction have been. invested by Statute with the power of dealing summarily with a very large numberof criminal offences.Fourthly, various functions in civil matters have from time to time beenassigned by Statute to Justices of the Peace. The most important of these is the licensing of places for the sale of intoxicating liquor. They have also jurisdiction in such matters as Affiliation Orders, Separation and Protection Orders, disputesunder the Employers and Workmen Act of 1885, &amp;c.Finally, Justices of the Peace have a number of duties which have been called&quot; ministerial,&quot; particularly the taking of declarations under certain Acts ofParliament.The powers and duties of Justices of the Peace in Scotland are much lessextensive than in England and Wales. In Scotland Justices of the Peace areempowered to deal with statutory offences under certain Acts, such as the ChildrenAct and Cruelty to Animals Act, and with small debt cases not exceeding  5.They possess certain administrative functions, for instance, licensing; and theyare called upon to perform ministerial duties similar to those performed byEnglish Justices.   But their criminal jurisdiction is extremely limited.Methods which have of late Years regulated the Selection of Justices.Recommendations of persons to be appointed Justices of the Peace forcounties are usually made to the Lord Chancellor by the Lord Lieutenant. It isimportant, however, to observe that the position which the Lord Lieutenantoccupies in regard to the appointment of Justices is not one of right but of custom.The origin of this custom is not easy to trace, but it apparently dates from about the end of the 18th century. In the debate in the House of Lords of May,1838, Lord Holland expressed the belief that it came into existence in consequenceof an attack upon Lord Somers. But in his evidence before us Lord Loreburnreferred to a copy of a proceeding at Quarter Sessions about the year 1745, &quot; from&quot; which it appeared that Lord Hardwicke, who was then Lord Chancellor, had&quot; written to the county members, asking them if they could recommend to him F&quot; suitable persons to be justices of the peace, and they came to Quarter Sessions&quot; and asked the Grand Jury to furnish them with a list of suitable names.&quot; 2
The office of Lord Lieutenant has for a long time past been invariably eom-bined with that of Custos Rotulorum, or Keeper of the Rolls of the Justices.Thus, in addition to his high rank and extensive local connections, the lord lieutenant is virtually the head of the magistracy in his county, and therefore a person whose assistance the Lord Chancellor would naturally seek.Attempts, however, to claim on behalf of the Lords Lieutenant any absoluteright to recommend persons for appointment, or to be the sole channels through which recommendations should be made, have usually evoked vigorous protests from the Lord Chancellors and others.In 1830, in the course of a debate in the House of Lords, the Lord Chancellor,Lord Brougham, warned the Lords Lieutenant that he would interfere unless they made a wider selection of Justices. Speaking in the same debate Lord Eldonsaid that in the event of efficient persons being omitted by the Lords Lieutenant, itwas in the power, and he might add it was the duty, of the Lord Chancellor to correct these omissions whenever they came under his observation.1In 1838, Lord Cottenham, then Lord Chancellor, vigorously repelled an attackmade upon him for not accepting the advice of a Lord Lieutenant, and it was onthis occasion that the Duke of Wellington said that &quot; he knew, and he believed&quot; that the Lords Lieutenant in general knew, that the right to appoint the&quot; Magistrates rested exclusively by law in the hands of the person holding the&quot; great seal. Courtesy and custom had enabled the Lords Lieutenant to recommendation-&quot; mend to the person holding the great seal, the names of gentlemen who were&quot; to be Magistrates.&quot; in more recent times the practice of Lord Chancellors in dealing with therecommendations of the Lord Lieutenant has varied.Lord Halsbury when giving evidence before us stated that &quot; in 99 cases out&quot; of 100 he accepted the recommendation of the Lord Lieutenant as a matter of&quot; course.&quot; 3Lord Herschell at first followed the same practice. In 1893 he informed adeputation that &quot; while the legal right of appointing Magistrates for counties as&quot; well as for boroughs was vested in him alone, he himself did not feel justified&quot; in setting aside the long standing practice and constitutional usage which had&quot; grown up of limiting the county appointments to persons nominated by the Lord&quot; Lieutenant unless he was fortified in doing so by an unequivocal declaration of&quot; the opinion of the House &quot; of Commons.4Shortly afterwards, on the 5th May, 1893, the following resolution, moved by Sir Charles Dilke, was carried in the House of Commons :&quot; That in the opinion of this House it is expedient that the appoint-&quot; ment of county magistrates should no longer be made by the Lord Chan-&quot; cellors of Great Britain and Ireland for the time being only on the&quot; recommendation of the Lords Lieutenant.&quot; 5Lord Herschell acted upon this resolution by making many appointmentswithout any recommendations from the Lords Lieutenant.The present Lord Chancellor described; his own practice in the following words : &quot; My view is that no Lord Chancellor ought to admit any right in any-&quot; one to control his judgment. It would be intolerable if he were required&quot; to bear the whole responsibility for appointment which the law entrusts&quot; solely to him, but were constrained to act upon the opinion of someone&quot; else. My own practice has been to communicate freely with the Lords&quot; Lieutenant, and I have done so with every one of them whenever any&quot; difficulty has arisen, or any complaints from any county. With very few&quot; exceptions they have been quite willing to co-operate, and have taken a&quot; great deal of trouble. My endeavour has been, in the first instance, to&quot; procure an agreement in the county itself, so that if possible the Lord&quot; Lieutenant should communicate himself with representative people of&quot;all op inions in the county, and frame a list which would give general&quot; satisfaction. This has been done in something like 35 or 40 counties&quot; out of 98, including sokes, liberties, ridings, and counties of cities. In&quot; a good many of them it already had been the practice of the Lord&quot;Lieutenant to gather opinion on the spot and make recommendations&quot; accordingly, and no substantial complaint had ever reached me in regard1 Hansard, 3rd Series, Vol. L, 678. 2 Hansard, 3rd Series, Vol. XLIIL, 1278.5 Halsbary, Q. 1124, p. 54. 4 Hansard, 4th Series, Vol. XII., 284.a 6 Hansard, 4th Series,Vol. XII., 258.
&quot; to those counties.   Where, however, this has not been practicable, and&quot; trouble has arisen accordingly, I have interposed.   The result has been&quot; that I have acted with the concurrence of the Lords Lieutenant in regard&quot; to almost all the appointments that I have made in my term of office.&quot; In the years 1906-7, 1908, and 1909, 5,531 Justices of the Peace were&quot; appointed in counties that is including sokes, liberties, ridings, and&quot; so forth, and I should think 98 to 99 per cent, have been appointed with&quot; the concurrence of the Lord Lieutenant.   It is only in a very^ few cases&quot; that I have been obliged to appoint without his concurrence.&quot; 1In the county palatine of Lancaster, in the year 1870, a change was madein the manner of appointing County Justices.   In that year &quot; owing to the large&quot;and unnecessary number of County Justices made&quot; during the five or sixpreceding years, &quot; chiefly as rewards for political services,&quot; and to the gravedissatisfaction which had arisen with the system upon which the appointmentswere made, Lord JDufferin, who was at that time Chancellor of the Duchy,resolved to amend the procedure.   A minute, dated the 28th April 1870, was accordingly passed with the consent of the Cabinet, over which Mr. Gladstonepresided, directing that &quot; in future all appointments to the county bench should only be made upon the nomination of the Lord Lieutenant.&quot; 2This Minute was acted upon from 1871 to 1893 when Mr. Bryce, after somecorrespondence with Lord Sefton, who was then Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire,revoked the Minute of 1870.On the 7th March 1893, Mr. Bryce signed the following Minute : &quot; In view of the dissatisfaction which has been found to exist in&quot;Lancashire with the working of the arrangement embodied in the&quot;memorandum of the 28th day of April 1870, for the selection and&quot; recommendation by the Lord Lieutenant of the County Palatine of&quot; Lancaster of magistrates for that county, and having regard to the&quot; changes which have taken place in the system of county government&quot; since that date, the Chancellor of the Duchy withdraws that memo-&quot; randum, and reverts to the practice which prevailed prior to the above&quot; date, under which the Chancellor .of the Duchy received recommenda-&quot; tions from various quarters, and himself selected persons to be&quot; appointed magistrates for the County Palatine. Her Majesty&quot; signified Her approval of this arrangement.&quot; 3In 1895 on a change of government there was a return to the arrangementeffected by Lord Dufferin, and on the .27th January 1896 the following Minutewas recorded in the records of the Duchy Council: &quot; Appointment of Magistrates for the County Palatine. The Chan-&quot; cellor of the Duchy considering it expedient to rever to the mode of&quot; appointing Magistrates for the County Palatine of Lancaster established&quot; by the Council Minute of April 28th, 1870, places his signature to a&quot; memorandum in the following form: &apos; It appearing to the Chancellor&quot; &apos; of the Duchy, after consultation with Her Majestv&apos;s other Ministers,&quot; &apos; that the selection of Magistrates for the County Palatine in accordance&quot; &apos; with the Memorandum of March 7th, 1893, has produced results very&quot; &apos; injurious to the public service, withdraws that memorandum, and&quot; &apos; reverts to the practice established by the Minute of April 28th, 1870,&quot; &apos; under which the Magistrates for the County Palatine were appointed&quot; &apos; by the Chancellor of the Duchy upon the recommendation of the&quot;&apos; Lord Lieutenant of the County Palatine; subject to the conditions set&quot; &apos; out in the said Minute of April 28, 1870.&apos; Her Majesty has signified&quot; Her approval of this arrangement.&quot; 4The practice indicated in this Minute continued until 1906. It was thenmodified by Lord Wolverhampton, who, in reply to a question addressed to himby Lord Derby, then Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire, said, employing somewhatdoubtful phraseology, that &quot; he would always be pleased to appoint any^ magistrate so nominated by the Lord Lieutenant, but for the reasons he gave&quot; he should reserve to himself the right to receive general applications from&quot; Lancashire with reference to the County Benches, and if he desired to&quot; do so to recommend them himself to the Lord Lieutenant for his special con-&quot; sideration, and if he saw no reason to the contrary forward his nomination&quot; back to him as Chancellor for appointment.&quot; s1 Loreburn, Q. 243, p. 12. 2 Smith, Qs. 621-623, p. 33. 3 Mitchell, Q. 639 v 36* Mitchell, Q. 646, p. 36. * Mitchell, Q. 650, p. 36.
In lyOS, when Lord Shuttleworth became Lord Lieutenant, LordWolverhampton decided to revert to the practice established in 1871, and directed that in future all recommendations should in the first instance be made by theLord Lieutenant. He reserved to himself, however, pro forma, the right to place before the Lord Lieutenant the names of any persons whom he specially desiredto appoint.1 This arrangement has been continued by Lord Wolverhampton&apos;ssuccessors in office up to the present time.Position and Opportunities of the Lord Lieutenant.It is obvious that the Lord Lieutenant cannot be personally acquainted with every possible candidate for the Bench.   He is bound therefore, particularly if hisbe a large county, to seek assistance and obtain advice and information fromothers.The methods pursued by the different Lords Lieutenant in obtaining informa-tion appear to vary widely, but apparently the persons most usually consultedare the Chairmen of Quarter Sessions, the Chairmen of Petty Sessions, the clerk of the Peace, and the Clerks to the Justices. In addition to these, however, theLord Lieutenant, as a rule, would rely upon the advice which he could procurefrom a large circle of personal friends in whose discretion and judgment he couldplace confidence. Some Lords Lieutenant seem to work upon a more systematicplan than others, but, generally speaking, there would appear to be some ground for the suggestion that the opportunities of obtaining information afforded to theLord Lieutenant are insufficient and the results therefore unsatisfactory.It appears that the Lords Lieutenant have not in all cases before making recommendations ascertained whether additional Justices are required in thepublic service.   It would be an advantage if this duty were imposed upon them.It is true that an inquiry of this kind is attended with some difficulty, as there is no prescribed complement for each Bench, and therefore it is not a simplequestion of filling up vacancies. The problem which the Lord Lieutenant hasto solve is whether there are a sufficient number of Justices actively discharging their duties in each Petty Sessional Division, and, in determining this, regardmust be had not only to the attendances at Sessions but also to the sufficiency ofJustices for the purpose of discharging duties of an administrative rather than a judicial nature attached to the office.In one instance, referred to before us, the Lord Lieutenant, assisted by asmall informal committee, had made careful inquiry as to the necessities of eachPetty Sessional Division in the county, which enabled him to determine very closely the normal number of Justices required for each division.2 It is doubtfulwhether such careful inquiries are instituted in all cases. It is probable thatthere is a tendency to submit recommendations to the Lord Chancellorirrespective of the actual needs of the county.The same difference in practice of the different Lords Lieutenant is to befound in the actual selection of names for recommendation. No doubt in most cases the Lords Lieutenant are not content until the qualifications of candidatesare verified by repeated inquiries from various sources. But in some cases ithas been alleged that there has been a disposition on the part of the lord lieutenant to rely mainly if not wholly on the advice of one or.two particularpersons whose social or political predilections may influence the LordLieutenants choice. We think that such paramount influence where it existshas an injurious effect and is to be regretted.In addition to the recommendations made by the Lords Lieutenant, the LordChancellor receives, particularly in the case of appointments to the BoroughBenches, a large number of recommendations from Members of, or candidates for, Parliament, and even from political associations and agents. Some recom-mendations are also received from non-political organisations such as tradeunions.Dissatisfaction with existing Methods of Selection.The appointment of Justices and the method of their selection have fromtime to time been the cause of complaint and dissatisfaction which have foundexpression in debates in Parliament. The debates in the House of Lords in 1830and 1838 and that in the House of Commons in 1893 on Sir Charles Dilke&apos;motion have already been mentioned. Since 1905, there have been discussions in the house of Lords on three occasions, in 1906, 1907, and 1909; and in theHouse of Commons several Bills have been introduced proposing alterations inthe system of selection.1 Mitchell, Q: 653, p. 36.Fortescue, Q. 2613, p. 124.
In December 1906 the present Lord Chancellor received a Memorial on thissubject, a copy of which we reproduce in the Appendix to this Report. ThisMemorial was signed by 88 County Members.Speaking generally, in 1905 there was a great preponderance on most of theCounty Benches of Justices of one political complexion; There were several reasons for this inequality. It was due, as the Lord Chancellor told us, partly to the system and.partly to other causes.In the first place, the majority of persons with whom the Lord Lieutenantis personally acquainted, and from whom he probably derives his information,,are Conservatives in politics.Lord Loreburn stated in his evidence : &quot; Social life in most counties among&quot; those who are well-to-do is mainly Conservative, and in a good many places&quot; political feeling is apt to run high. There is often a large field of selection,&quot; and it is natural that men should regard more favourably those who are of the&quot; same opinions as themselves. I think this largely accounts for the fact that&quot; there is a constant disposition to prefer Conservatives in the recommendations&quot; made to the Lords Lieutenant, apart from any intention of doing what is&quot; unfair. In a few counties, which I happen to know about, there has been a&quot;distinct and deliberate wish to exclude Liberals because they are Liberals, but&quot; I do not think that is usual, and in hardly any case is that the wish of the Lord&quot; Lieutenant. It is done, where it is done, by the political partisanship of those&quot; upon whom he relies for advice. I do, however, think that party and social&quot; predilection have the effect automatically of causing a great predominance of&quot; gentlemen of one set of opinions being brought before the Lord Lieutenant,&quot;though there may be no desire to act unfairly.&quot; 1The preponderance of Conservatives was no doubt accentuated by thesecession in 1886 from the Liberal Party of those who were opposed to Mr.Gladstone^ Home Rule Policy.Another cause was the property qualification which was not abolished until1906. This qualification automatically restricted the field of selection and nodoubt excluded a large number of Liberals who were otherwise suitable for theposition.This preponderance of Justices drawn from one political party has been described as a &quot; political misfortune.&quot; 2 The impression that persons of oneset of political opinions were in practice being excluded from appointment hasengendered a sense of dissatisfaction which it is of the highest importance todissociate from the administration of justice. In the Lord Chancellors words,&quot; it is contrary to the public interest that the authority of the Bench of Justices&quot; should be weakened by any widespread suspicion that the members of it are&quot; not fairly selected.&quot; 3At the same time it is right to point out that some of the indignationaroused in connection with appointments to the Bench is due to the fact that theoffice of Justice of the Peace is often desired for the sake of the social distinctionwhich it is thought to confer. If there are many more of one party than anotherwho have the right to affix the letters J.P. to their names the grievance is deeplyfelt. We regret this state of feeling, and we think that no opportunity shouldbe lost of emphasising the strictly judicial character of the Justice&apos;s office. Inthis connection we are glad to be able to report that no important evidence hasbeen given to the effect that the Justices&apos; decisions have been tainted by politicalpartisanship.Recognising as we do the important judicial and administrative duties tobe discharged by Justices of the Peace, we entertain a strong opinion that theirselection should be contolled and guided by considerations which will securethat the office shall be filled by men of sufficient ability, of impartial judgmentand high character.The present practice and system of selection frequently results in theabsence or deficiency of those attributes.The suggestion that a person should be appointed as a Justice of the Peacesometimes proceeds from himself. Also in some cases the applicant appeals tothe political agent with whom he has been associated. In that event the nextstep often is for the political agent to prepare a list of applicants to be submitted in counties to the Lord Lieutenant, in boroughs to the Lord Chancellor,frequently through the agency of the Member of Parliament or some candidateconcerned. These lists are prepared with the object of rewarding and encouraging political  support and  of  assisting party  political  interests.1 Lpreburn, Q. 243, p. 12.   2 Hansard, 4th Series, Vol. CLXXIL, 1362 ; Loreburn, Q. 243 n 113 Loreburn, Q. 243, p. 11.
Naturally the chief qualification sought for is political service. The politicalagent does not represent himself as a judge of the fitness of the applicant to be selected as a Justice of the Peace. The Member of Parliament who forwardshis name to the Lord Lieutenant or Lord Chancellor may be deficient in localknowledge and in opportunity of judgment. In such cases it is difficult for (him as a politician to reject the agent&apos;s list and naturally it is not infrequentlyaccepted. The evils of such a system of selection to a judicial office are surelyapparent.In the first place all political parties seek to take advantage of any availableopportunity to demand and secure the appointment of Justices; such demandproceeds from a desire to strengthen party interests.Little care is given to the existing number of Justices already in the Corn-mission. Benches may be crowded, and yet the appointment of more Justicesis demanded and strongly supported.A phase created by the present system should be noted.In the different localities the political opinions of the Justices are ascer-tained, and count is taken of the so-called &quot; balance &quot; of party strength.As we have stated, for some years past a majority of Justices on the Corn-missions have belonged to the Conservative or Unionist party. This has proceeded from different causes as indicated above.In many cases the numerical preponderance of one party on the magisterialbenches is noted and resented, whilst the causes which have occasioned it areforgotten or ignored. A desire then springs up and a claim is made &apos;&apos; to redressthe balance.&quot; This claim is then presented to the Lord Chancellor, fullpolitical support is afforded to it, and unfortunately those who make and support this claim are often willing to see the redress of the balance secured without making sufficient inquiry as to the magisterial qualifications of the persons nominated.Thus it is that in many districts the selection of even competent Justices ofthe Peace is regarded as the result of party success, and the Justices themselves are regarded as the representatives of a political party or of a social class.Their character for impartiality may be wrongly enough imperilled, and that respect without which the due and effective administration of the law isunattainable is injuriously affected.The views expressed by Lord Lansdowne in the House of Lords on 22ndApril 1907 appear to be deserving of approval. Lord Lansdowne said : &quot; I&quot; regret as much as the noble and learned Lord regrets that in the result it&quot; should prove to be the case that so enormous a preponderance of magistrates&quot; in some counties should be drawn from one political party rather than the&quot; other. That is a political misfortune; but it would be a still greater misfortune&quot; if, in order to redress the disparity, incompetent persons were appointed&quot; recklessly and in a wholesale manner.&quot; 1We also recognise the existing inequality, and regret it, although the disparity of which Lord Lansdowne spoke in 1907 has been appreciably reducedduring the last three years. Those who appoint Justices or make recommenda-tions for appointment ought not to be indifferent to the existence of thisinequality, and should endeavour &quot; to redress the balance &quot; so far as publicinterests will permit.It is well that this gradual process should be pursued, for it is better thattime should be occupied in curing or mitigating the disease, than that resortshould be had to a remedy which would tend to reproduce the disease itself.Suggested Remedies for Existing Evils.But how are remedies for these evils to be found ?Speaking very generally we in the first place express the opinion that the evils now existing in the system of selecting Justices of the Peace can, to a great extent, be remedied by removing political opinions and political action from theinfluences affecting such selection.The substitutes for such political opinion and influences should be found inthe fitness of the intended Justices, and such fitness should be constituted bytheir moral and personal character, their general ability, business habits,independence of judgment, and common sense.It has been well said that the strength of the law depends upon the respect in which it is holden. It is equally true that respect for the judges whoadminister the law represents its strength.1 Hansard, 4th Series, Vol. CLXXII., 1302.
Acting as a judge within a limited area a man&apos;s character, habits, and worthare well known. An unworthily chosen Magistrate brings discredit upon thesystem of voluntary untrained Justices.The voluntary system, no doubt, excludes the existence of a high judicialstandard; but such standard may find some equivalent if only men of highcharacter and intelligence be appointed to act as Justices.Political zeal and decided political convictions in no way represent suchequivalent standard.We therefore express the confident view that political opinion or politicalservices should not be regarded as in any way controlling or influencing theappointment of Justices. The man most fitted to discharge the duties of theoffice should be appointed. The declaration contained in the Statute of Henry Vshould still prevail: Justices of the Peace must be residents in their severalcounties, &quot; of the best reputation, and most worthy men in the county:&quot;We seek to enforce these views by recording an opinion, formed after fullinquiry, that appointments influenced by considerations of political opinion and services are highly detrimental to public interests, and tend to lower theauthority of the Magisterial Benches in the country.We hold also that anyone who takes share or part in giving effect to suchinfluence is playing an injurious part in the citizenship of the country, and istherefore deserving of much censure.We are aware that we are condemning a practice which has existed indifferent degrees for a long period.Mere sentiment will not be strong enough to abolish it; the expression oftheoretical opinion will be equally unavailing. We are, therefore, making anattempt by practical observations and suggestions to strengthen the hands ofthose who desire to see the appointment of Justices uninfluenced by politicalopinions or the claims of political service.We have shown how necessary it is to consider the qualities which rendera person suitable to be a Justice of the Peace, and we have already referred.tothe important judicial and administrative duties which the holders of the office are called upon to discharge. We have also expressed the opinion that in viewof these duties it is necessary that Justices should be men of sufficient ability,of impartial and independent judgment, and of high personal character. But itis also in the public interest that they should be men who command general con-fidence. And for this reason also it is desirable that the area of selection shouldbe wide, and the choice comprehensive, so that the Bench may include men of allsocial classes and of all shades of creed and political opinion.The removal of the property qualification for County Justices by the act of 1906 has of course materially enlarged the field of selection. Under theoperation of this Act members of all classes are eligible for appointment, and weconcur in the view which has been presented to us very forcibly that it is in thepublic interest that working men with a first-hand knowledge of the conditionsof life among their own class should be appointed to the County as well as tothe Borough Benches.But the more the area is extended, the more difficult becomes the task of selection; and this difficulty must be recognised in deciding upon the methodwhich should be adopted.Appointment of Justices to remain with the Crown.We are strongly of opinion that the appointment of Justices of the Peaceshould continue to be made by the Crown. We have received very little evidence in favour of the popular election of Justices, and such evidence as has been givenin this direction has been rather as a suggestion of a means for redressing thepolitical balance than as an ideal system.The appointment of judicial officers of any kind by direct popular electionis altogether opposed to English constitutional usage. Popular election wouldprobably mean political election. The influence which we have so stronglycondemned would thus be rendered all powerful.Neither can we accept a popular electorate as furnishing good judgment inthe selection of men for magisterial office.It has also been represented to us that it is expedient that the number ofea-officio Justices should be increased, and the duration of their term of office
extended. We do not agree with this view. A man may be well fitted to be chair-man of a local body without possessing the qualities to be desired in a justice of the Peace Those who elect their chairman do not regard his fitness for theMagistracy.Lord Chancellor to advise the Crown.So long as appointments are made by the Crown, the Lord Chancellor is obviously the most suitable Minister to be entrusted with the duty of advisingupon the selections to be made. He is not only the Keeper of the Great Sealunder which the commissions are issued. He is also the head of the Justiciary,and in that character &apos;&apos; is entrusted with the task of deciding what is best for the&quot;administration of justice.&quot;1 He is Your Majesty&apos;s responsible adviser inregard to the appointment of Judges, and in giving such advice he does not actas a politician. The keeper of the Sovereign^ conscience can regard only the welfare of the State. He is a Minister of the highest dignity and importance,and as little subject to influence or political pressure as any Minister can be.The chief difficulties with which he has to contend, namely, lack of personal andlocal knowledge and dependence on information derived from others, would alsoconfront any other Minister or committee of Ministers.Our conclusion, therefore, is that the Lord Chancellor should continue todischarge the duty of appointing Justices of the Peace. At the same time we-think it well to quote from the present Lord Chancellors evidence on this point.&quot; If,&quot; he said, &quot; it be decided that the Lord Chancellor should remain the final&quot; authority upon this subject, I think it cannot be too strongly impressed upon&quot; the public at large that this duty is closely connected with the administration&quot; of justice, and for that reason they ought to support him in administering it&quot; in a judicial spirit and not as appertaining to his administrative position as&quot;a member of the Government of the day.&quot;in the County Palatine of Lancaster the Chancellor of the Duchy occupiesa position in relation to the appointment of Justices of the Peace similar to thatwhich the Lord Chancellor holds in the rest of England and Wales, and we areof opinion that the Chancellor of the Duchy should continue to discharge theduty of advising the Crown in regard to the appointment of Justices within thecounty.Future Position of Lords Lieutenant.We are of opinion that the Lords Lieutenant of Counties should, subjectto what is hereinafter stated, retain the practice of making recommendations to the Lord Chancellor of persons for appointment as Justices of the Peace.The peculiar position which the Lord Lieutenant occupies has been referredto above. In the capacity of Your Majesty&apos;s representative, he has a position inthe county which no other person can attain. That position gives him greatopportunities of acquiring trustworthy information as to the character andqualities of candidates for the Bench. Moreover, as &quot; Custos Eotulorum &quot; he isthe head of the Magistracy in the county. .We are aware that charges have been brought against the Lords Lieutenanton the ground that they have shown political partiality in their recommendations.Except in a few cases, no evidence has been given before us in support of these charges. The present Lord Chancellor has on more than one occasion testifiedto the desire of the Lords Lieutenant to act with fairnss and discretion whensubmitting recommendations to him.In his reply to the Memorial addressed to him by the Liberal County members in 1906 Lord Loreburn wrote as follows: &quot;It is bare justice, I should say, that, with rare exceptions, the Lords&quot; Lieutenant with whom I have been in communication have acted and&quot; advised impartially, and have taken much pains; not always, indeed,&quot; agreeing with my views, but, as I believe, because they consider that&quot; their position as representatives of the Crown imposes on them the duty.&quot; If, in any cases, the names forwarded to them have come to be known&quot; and canvassed in political circles, it is a most legitimate grievance, but&quot; I do not believe it is any fault of theirs. Without their help it would be&quot; impracticable to transact the business, and they have often warned&quot; against and so prevented most undesirable appointments.&quot; 31 Loreburn, Q. 244, p. 14.3 Appendix II.2 Ibid.
We desire to express our anticipation that the Lords Lieutenant will recognise the advancing claim for democratic consideration. The legislation of 1906formally declared the opinions, of the legislature in this direction, and minglingas the Lords Lieutenant do with those who can well represent public opinion,we express the strong hope that in the future they will attach no heed, except tothe extent mentioned in this Report, to the political or religious opinions of thosewho are recommended for appointment to the office of Justices of the- Peace.But in order to assist both the Lords Lieutenant in recommending and theLord Chancellor in appointing Justices, we desire to make the following recommendations: Advisory Committees.We recommend that in every county one or more Justices&apos; Committees, con-si sting of not more than five members, should be appointed by the LordChancellor. Of such Committees the Lord Lieutenant should be a member, if hebe willing to serve.In constituting these Committees regard should primarily be had to theimportance of giving them a representative character, so as to secure theexpression on them of different views and currents of public opinion.The duties of such Committees should be to advise the Lord Chancellor onthe following subjects :  1. The number of Justices taking active share in the discharge of magis-terial duty in each Petty Sessional Division, and the number ofJustices required for the due discharge of such duties.2. The necessity, if it exists, for appointing additional Justices.3. The desirability of calling upon Justices in certain cases to resign onaccount of non-attendance.In the selection of Justices we recommend that it will be well to leave thepower of recommendation with the Lord Lieutenant, but that he shall receivesuggestions from the Committee, and transmit these suggestions to the LordChancellor.   Also that the Lord Chancellor shall, when he thinks right, consult the Committee upon the fitness of relative claims of suggested candidates. Fullpower should be reserved to the Lord Chancellor to control the practice and procedure of the Committee.We think it should be within the power of the Lord Chancellor to appoint asimilar Committee in every Borough having a separate commission on the peace.Considerations affecting the Appointment of Justices.Although we have expressed a strong opinion that no appointments shouldbe made on the ground of political opinions or services, it is even more important that no one should be excluded from the Bench on account of his religious or political opinions. For, as we have said, the strength of these MagisterialBenches depends upon the respect in which their occupants are held. To earnthat respect and confidence it is well that the public should recognise that theBenches are open to men of every shade of political opinion and of every religiousfaith.For similar reasons we regard as desirable the admission to the Benches ofmen of every social grade. When the Legislature in 1906 abolished the propertyqualification for County Justices, a declaration was made that property ought not to disqualify a man for being placed in a Commission of the Peace.Besides the importance of obtaining as far as possible on each Benchadequate representation of different views in politics and religion and ofdifferent social classes, it is also in our opinion necessary to have Justices resident in every part of every division of the county, so as to avoid any inconveniencein obtaining the issue of summonses, the taking of declarations, and the per-formance of other magisterial duties exerciseable out of sessions.Interference of Members of Parliament.We have in the course of this Report shown how leading is the part in therecommendation of Justices urged upon Parliamentary Members and Candidates.We strongly condemn such interference.   It is essentially political in origin and
report. 4-3effect. A Member of Parliament is necessarily placed in a false position whenhe is urged, possibly on political grounds, to make recommendations which go beyond his personal knowledge. ,     ,Both the Lord Chancellor and the Lords Lieutenant must often be greatlyembarrassed by the receipt of political demands they cannot with proprietyaccede to.   Their refusal to do so produces complaint and criticism, injurious to all interests, TWe therefore strongly urge those who may be the Lord Chancellor or LordsLieutenant or members of an Advisory Committee that they should firmly refuseto receive any applications, or unasked-for advice to appoint Justices, from members of Parliament or Candidates in their own constituencies, or from political agents or representatives of political associations. If such rule bemade and acted on all concerned, especially Members of Parliament andCandidates, will be able to escape from a position they must deplore.It may be that the Member of Parliament may be able to afford usefulinformation and advice. There is nothing in this Report which would preventthe Lord Chancellor or Lords Lieutenant or members of an Advisory Committeeapplying for such assistance.   It is only unasked-for action we condemn.We feel compelled to make the above suggestion. Our Commission bids uslabour to find a remedy for an evil assumed to exist. It is therefore our duty tosuggest steps for securing the selection of Justices of the Peace unaffected bytheir supposed political merits.We believe that the loyal acceptance of the above recommendation would do much to secure such result.Appointments in Lancashire.The appointment of Justices in Lancashire stands apart. But we thinkthat our recommendations as to the creation of Advisory Committees and therepudiation of political influence should apply equally to the County Palatineas to the rest of the country.Discharge of Duties.By many who are appointed Justices the office is regarded as one of socialdistinction only, the duties of the office are forgotten and the discharge of themdisregarded.Numerically a Commission of the Peace may thus become overladen, whilstsufficient Justices willing to discharge the duties of their office cannot be relied on.   This is an evil which should be remedied.We suggest that every Justice&apos; on appointment should be required formally to undertake to fulfil his fair share of magisterial duties, such fair share to be controlled locally by rota or otherwise. The attendances of every Justice atPetty Sessions should be certified annually by the Clerk of the Justices to theLord Chancellor, and if it appeared to the Lord Chancellor that there had inany case been neglect of duty he should call upon the Justice for an explanation.In the absence of a valid excuse the Justice should be called upon to resign his office. If he refuses to do so, his name should be struck out of the Commissionof the Peace.It has been called to our attention that not infrequently Justices change their place of residence out of the area of the Commission for which they actinto that of another. It seems to us that under such circumstances a request to be transferred to the Commission for the district in which the new residenceis situated should receive very favourable consideration.Appointment of Brewers, Licensed Victuallers, Total Abstainers, &amp;c.The representatives of several interests appeared before us and asked that greater consideration should be shown to those interests. For instance, it was strongly urged on behalf of those engaged in the liquor trade that but few ofthem are appointed Justices. There is no disqualification for appointment ofBrewers and Licensed Victuallers by Statute. The number of these appoint-ments is entirely within the discretion of the Lord Chancellor, and with theexercise of that discretion we cannot recommend any interference. The sameobservation applies to the claim of pawnbrokers for greater consideration.Objection was taken to the appointment of total abstainers and particularly of advocates of total abstinence, who, it was alleged, fail in the discharge oftheir duties when dealing with licensing or cases affecting the liquor trade.
It was urged that such persons must be regarded as interested, and therefore that they ought not to be placed in a position to deal with cases affecting the liquor trade.We cannot recommend that an advocate of total abstinence should be disqualified for appointment as a Justice. His interest is only one of opinion,which does not disqualify any Judge. By our law the interest that disqualifiesmust be pecuniary or material. If such a person refuses to exercise his discretion as a Justice, as he would if he refused to sanction all licenses, suchnegation of his duty would be dealt with by the Lord Chancellor.Stipendiary Magistrates.In our opinion the appointment of Stipendiary Magistrates does not strictlycome within the terms of our Reference.Ireland.The terms of our Commission are general and would have enabled us to dealwith the appointment of Justices in Ireland-but it was called to our attentionthat the Prime Minister had stated in the House of Commons that our inquirywas not intended to include Ireland which might be dealt with by anindependent and further inquiry. We, therefore, have not inquired into Irishappointments.In conclusion, it remains only for us to express the hope that our laboursmay not be without fruit. We have endeavoured to show the necessity for raising the standard of character and efficiency of Justices of the Peace. Weconfidently appeal to those who recommend and appoint such Justices to considerthe interests of the public, and to make it their care that only men fit todischarge judicial duties shall receive appointment. The task of effecting this result will not be difficult; public opinion will clear the way.Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations.The conclusions we have arrived at and the recommendations we make areas follows:  1. The appointment of Justices of the Peace should continue to be madeby the Crown2. The Lord Chancellor as the head of the Justiciary should remain responsible for the advice given to the Crown in relation to the selection,appointment, and discipline of Justices of the Peace.3. The Lords Lieutenant of Counties should retain the practice of recom-mending to the Lord Chancellor, for his approval, persons to be appointedJustices of the Peace, subject to the following conditions : (i) That the Lord Chancellor should nominate within each county one ormore small representative Committees, to inform and advise theLord Chancellor and the Lord Lieutenant,(ii) That the persons to be selected as members of the Committees, andthe practice and procedure of the Committees, should be left to the discretion of the Lord Chancellor.4.   In boroughs the Lord Chancellor should have power to appoint similarCommittees.5. We are of opinion that it is not in the public interest that there shouldbe an undue preponderance of Justices drawn from one political party.6. We strongly condemn the influence and action of politicians being allowed to secure appointments on behalf of any political party.7. We submit to the Lord Chancellor for the time being that he ought to reject and repudiate any suoh influence, and we equally urge that LordsLieutenant and anyone recommending persons for appointment as Justicesshould decline to recognise political or religious opinions as any ground ofqualification or disqualification.8. We also submit that the Lord Chancellor and the Lords Lieutenantshould refuse to receive any unasked-for recommendations for appointment from members of Parliament or candidates for such membership in their ownconstituencies, or from political agents or representatives of politicalassociations.9. In view of the important judicial and administrative duties whichJustices of the Peace are called upon to discharge, it is necessary that persons appointed to the office should be men of moral and good personal character,general ability, business habits, independent judgment, and common sense.
report.10. It is in the public interest that persons of every social grade shouldbe appointed Justices of the Peace, and that working men with a first-handknowledge of the conditions of life among their own class should be appointedto the County as well as to the Borough Benches.11. The appointment of every Justice should be accompanied by a formalundertaking on his part to fulfil his fair share of magisterial duties, and inthe absence of any valid excuse for neglect to discharge such duties he shouldbe called upon to resign his office, and if he refuses to resign he should beremoved from the Commission of the Peace. But a request on the part of aJustice who has changed his place of residence out of the area of the Corn-mission for which he acts to be transferred to the Commission for the districtin which the new residence is situated should receive very favourable consideration.12. We do not recommend any alteration in the law affecting the qualification of any classes of persons to be appointed or to act as Justices ofthe Peace.13. We do not recommend any increase in the number of ex-officio Justices,or any extension of the duration of their term of office.In conclusion we desire to acknowledge the great assistance we havereceived in every stage of our inquiry from the Secretary of the Commission.In the discharge of somewhat difficult duties Mr. Symonds has displayedgreat ability, assiduity and tact.

Symonds, Secretary.6th July, 1910.The following letter has been addressed to the Chairman of theCommission : Middleton Park,Bicester.My dear Lord James,Though I have been prevented by illness from attending the sittings ofthe Commissioners, I have closely followed the evidence laid before them.I have carefully studied their Report, and fully concur in their conclusions.Should their suggestions be adopted, I believe that the difficulties occasionallyincident to the present system of appointing Justices of the Peace would be materially minimised, if not entirely obviated.Yours sincerely,(Signed)      Jersey.Whilst signing the above Report, we desire to be allowed to add the following memoranda: (Signed)      Frederick Verney.W. Ryland D. Adkins.Thomas G. Ashton.* See Memorandum on page 16.
Memorandum by Mr. Ryland Adkins and Mr. Ashton.Much of the value of our recommendations appears to us to rest upon their being inter-dependent, a feature of the Report to which we call special attention.We consider that the present one-sided composition of magisterial benches inmany places is a greater evil than any that arises from the spontaneous action ofMembers of Parliament. If Members of Parliament are to have their actionchecked and limited in the way we have suggested in the Report, it is essentialthat simultanously an advisory committee of the kind recommended shouldeverywhere be formed, and that the Lords Lieutenant should not be allowed tomaintain the almost exclusive power of nomination of magistrates which theyhave in the past century possessed, except in Lancashire. The one alterationof procedure, in our judgment, must at once involve the other, and therefore theinter-dependence of these principal recommendations is of their essence.We would further express the opinion that of such a small committee theLord Lieutenant need not necessarily be a member, as he does not of necessityalways possess great knowledge of the residents of the county or even greatexperience of affairs.We hope that in many, if not all cases, the committee, which is to be of a&quot; representative character,&quot; may in fact include one or two leading members ofthe county or borough council.Lastly, we attach special importance to the certainty that the suggestions ofthese committees should all reach the Lord Chancellor who appoints them.(Signed)      W. Ryland D. Adkins.Thomas G. Ashton.Memorandum by Mr. Verney.I find myself unable to sign this Report without recording an objection to clause 8 in the &quot; Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations.&quot;The advice there tendered to the Lord Chancellor and Lords Lieutenantappears to be outside the scope of our reference which is &quot; to consider and report&quot; whether any and what steps should be taken to facilitate the selection of the&quot; most suitable persons to be Justices of the Peace, irrespective of creed and&quot; political opinion.&quot;In many cases, where a Member of Parliament or a candidate knows a constituency well, he is the most competent man to give an opinion as to thecharacter and reputation of those who desire to be made magistrates.To impose upon them&apos; a special disability implies that they have made a practice of recommending improper appointments, an implication not warrantedby the evidence laid before the Commission, and certainly not by the letter ofthe present Lord Chancellor to Sir John Brunner, printed in &quot; The Times &quot; of29th December, 1906, where he says, &quot; the great majority of the members who&quot; have sent me lists, have taken pains to recommend only suitable names, though&quot; even they are misled by false information. But some members have been far&quot; from careful, and close scrutiny is needed.&quot;The only practical way of &quot; refusing to receive &quot; unasked-for recommenda-&quot; tions &quot; would be to decline to appoint anyone recommended in this way, aproceeding in many cases so obviously unfair that no Lord Chancellor or lord lieutenant would be likely to adopt it.It should not be forgotten that Political Agents and representatives ofPolitical Associations are generally men selected as political leaders because oftheir local knowledge and position, who would be injured by recommendingunsuitable persons as magistrates, many of them being themselves on the Bench.&apos; While, therefore, cordially agreeing with the condemnation expressed in clause 6, and with what is urged in clause 7, it does not appear to me that theresults equally desired by all the members of the Commission will be attained bythe recommendations in clause 8, which impose silence on many who arepeculiarly qualified to speak, and who perform an important public duty inmaking, or refusing to make, recommendations for the appointment of magis-Ijrates in localities where they often have personal knowledge, and are under special responsibilities.(Signed)      Frederick Verney.Printed under the authority of HIS MAJESTVS STATIONERY office by Percy Lund, Humphries 6- Co.
