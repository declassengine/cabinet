-    125Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET. Copy No.   67CP. (45) 184.20th September, 1945.CABINET.MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR HOUSING.Note by the Prime Minister.1. In my note of the 16th August (CP. (45) 118) I set out the arrangements on which I had decided for the discharge of Ministerial responsibilities withregard to housing. Since that note was circulated the composition of theHousing Committee has been modified and further consideration has been givento the allocation of responsibility for the production of building materials and components.   It will, therefore, be convenient to restate the arrangements.2. The responsibility for housing rests with the Minister of Health inEngland and Wales and with the Secretary of State for Scotland in Scotland.It will be the duty of the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State forScotland to formulate their programme for the erection of houses, whetherpermanent or temporary, and for repairs, &amp;c.3. The Minister of Works has a general responsibility for the organisationand efficiency of the building industry as a whole. He does not, however, share in the responsibility for housing policy, and the relation of the Ministry of works to the Health Departments is that of a Supply Department concerned with theprovision of prefabricated houses and the supply of building materials and components. The Ministry of Works will continue to advise on questions ofbuilding technique but final responsibility for the design of houses will lie withthe Health Departments.[30551]
4. The Minister of Health will act as Chairman of a Housing committee composed as. follows : The Minister of Health (Chairman),The Minister of Works,The Minister of Town and Country Planning, or his parliamentary secretary,The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of  State for Scotland,Mr. Buchanan,The Minister of Labour and National Service, or his parliamentary secretary,The Minister of Supply and Aircraft Production, or one of his parliamentary Secretaries,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, or one of his parliamentary secretaries,The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of War Transport.It will be for the Ministers of Labour, Supply and Aircraft Production, Agri-culture and Fisheries and Town and Country Planning to decide when theyshould be represented by their Parliamentary Secretaries. In the early stages,when labour is one of the main difficulties, it will be convenient if the Ministerof Labour can himself attend the meetings of the Committee. The existenceof the Committee will not prevent informal consultations with the ministers in charge of Departments.5. A monthly Progress Report will be rendered to the Cabinet showingthe programme and the progress made. The Minister of Health will reportdirectly to me in the event of any difficulties arising with other Ministries whichcannot be cleared either by the Committee or by personal contact. The utmostdrive and vigour must be put into the campaign for houses.6. A separate note (CP. (45) 185) is being circulated about the allocation of responsibility for the production of building materials and components.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,20th September, 1945.
