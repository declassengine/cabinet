(45) 170.14th September, 1945.CABINET.NAVAL MAN-POWER REQUIREMENTS IN JUNE 1946 ANDPROGRAMME OF RELEASES TO THAT DATE.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.Proposed strength of the Navy in June 1946.IT is estimated that to carry out the tasks envisaged by the Chiefs of Staffin C.O.S. (45) 565 (O) the Navy will require in June 1946 a strength ofapproximately 400,000 men and 15,000 women. The relative proportions of menand women are subject to revision. These figures do not include the number of recruits who will be under training on that date as the intake for the first halfof 1946 has not yet been decided. In any case these new recruits are&quot; ineffectives.&quot;2. The strength of the Navy on the 31st May, 1945, before the start of releases under the Re-allocation Plan, was 772,000 men and 73,500 women (a totalof 845,500), so that the net reduction in strength between that date and the30th June, 1946, assuming the proportions in paragraph 1, will be of the orderof 372,000 men and 58,500 women (total 430,500). With the further speed up inthe rate of releases now planned, it is estimated that the strength of the Navy on the 31st December, 1945, will be 642,000 men and 55,500 women (total 697,500),a net reduction since the 31st May, 1945, after allowing for new entries, of130,000 men and 18,000 women (total 148,000).3. By June 1946 the Navy, therefore, has to reduce its strength by 51 percent, of the May 1945 figure. Just over one-third of this reduction will beeffected by December 1945, despite considerable new intake in the second half ofthis year.4. Releases in 1945. The target given to the Navy for the number of releases in Class A to be effected between the 18th June and the 31st &quot;December,1945 (M.P. (45) 8th Meeting), was :-Men............       ...       :..       110,000Women       ...      ...      ...      ... 15,000  .Total       ...      ...      ..:      ...      125,000Up to the end of August the releases and discharges reported to the Admiralty,excluding Class B, were 28,600 men and 8,950: women. Steps have beentaken to speed up Class A releases still further during 1945, and if these are successful the target will be substantially exceeded. - So far &quot;as male ratings andother ranks, R.M., are concerned, it is now planned to commence in December 1945the release of Age and Service Groups 27 and 28 originally scheduled for dispersalin January and February 1946. These are the two largest Age and ServiceGroups in the Navy and total some 38,000 men. It is unlikely that the wholeof these Age and Service Groups can be brought home and made available intime to complete their dispersal by the 31st December, but it is hoped that between[30520]
the 18th June, when releases started, and the 31st December, 1945, the numbersreleased, excluding Class B, will reach :-If this can be achieved the Navy will have exceeded its target of Class Areleases by 30,000 men and 3,000 women (total 33,000).5. In addition there will be a number of wastage releases (invalidings,compassionate cases, &amp;c).6. This is a considerable speed-up in the rate of releases for which we were planning as recently as July. Our original figure for the numbers of men to be released in Class A up to the end of 1945 was 90,000. In August this figure was increased to 110,000 and under the arrangements now being made the plannedfigure is 149,500, of which it is hoped to accomplish 140,000, an increase of 55 percent, on the original figure.7. Releases in 1946. Appendix attached shows the proposed time-table of releases to effect the necessary run-down in numbers by June 1946. Thestatement indicates the average weekly and monthly rates of releases of maleratings and other ranks R.M. from September 1945 onwards, and it will be seenthat, excluding officers, the Admiralty aim to reach a peak of over 8,600 releasesof men per week in January 1946. This peak cannot be reached earlier if theAge and Service Group principle is to be maintained because of the difficultyof bringing the men home in time. A large proportion of the ratings nowproposed for release in the first three months of 1946 are serving abroad, andthere are strong indications that the shipping situation during the remainingmonths of 1945 will be very difficult. Owing to the large distances involved aperiod of several months elapses between the time of despatch of reliefs fromthis country to the Pacific and the date of arrival in the United Kingdom ofthose who have been relieved. A pledge has been given on more than one occasion that men would be released so far as possible in their turn wherever they may be serving. The Admiralty have already stretched this pledge somewhatby arranging the programme for releases in eight-week periods, and allowingthose who happen to be in the country at the beginning of the period to be releasedat once. The fact that in the Navy the rate of release depends on the relative needs for men in different branches and categories allows of surplus ratings in aparticular category being dispersed early by authorising the release of the category concerned at a faster rate than the average.8. Release of women in 1946. To reach the reduced strength of15,000 W.R.N.S. by June 1946 a net reduction of 40,500 will be required fromthe estimated strength as at the 31st December, 1945, and a programme of releases is being arranged accordingly. It is anticipated that the number of class A releases will be 37,000.9. Man-power expended in Maintaining Surplus War Equipment. Attheir meeting on the 6th September, 1945, the Chiefs of Staff made reference tothe man-power which was now being devoted to the maintenance of surplus warequipment and to the economies which might be possible when decisions had beenreached regarding the disposal of this equipment. So far as the Navy isconcerned this would apply generally to surplus war material and stores, including aircraft and particularly to those ships which are now being maintained in reserve either in the case of lease-lend ships until a decision is reached if anciwhen they are to be returned to America, or in other instances whether the ships are to be purchased from us by other Nations. In any case this is an interimcommitment for which no manning provision has been made in the June 1948figures.10. Allocation of New Entries for the Second Half of 1945. The Navywas allocated 47,000 men (including 9,000 for Class B replacements). Thisallocation was related to our task of providing large forces for the repair andmaintenance of our ships in the Far East and for the construction of airfields and other accommodation on shore.    These expected requirements have beeaMen ...Women140,000*18,000Total158,000* See note (2) to Appendix A.
reduced very considerably by the cessation of hostilities and consequently a largeproportion of our approved intake-is not now &quot;required for its original purpose.Endeavour has been made to switch these men into other branches in order togive effect to the Governments wish to maintain a high rate of intake so as to speed up releases, but out of the 47,000 new intake allocated to the Navy forthe second half of 1945, it is unlikely that more than about 30,000 can be absorbed (including Class B replacements). Our current intake is now beingdevoted primarily to those branches whose release is lagging behind that of theaverage and our training capacity for these branches is already strained to theutmost. An exact figure for the number of recruits we can absorb in the currenthalf-year cannot yet be given, but the Ministry of Labour will be informed assoon as possible. It is understood that both the Army and the R.A.F. would welcome an increase in their present allocations.11. Publicity. Care will be required in any presentation of this releaseprogramme to the public if misunderstanding is to be avoided owing to the opera-tion of the variable age and service grouping for release in the Navy. TheAdmiralty would wish to collaborate with the Ministry of Labour in thepreparation of any such announcement.12. Doctors, Nurses and V.A.Ds. The number of doctors scheduled for release by June 1946 in the above proposals is 1,250. It is hoped that it will bepossible by that date to effect net releases of-*Nurses ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        550VA.D.S ....      .............      2,200; . *&apos;   - A.

The Age and Service Groups in this column represent the average for the branches of the Navy. Some branches, including the junior ratings of the Seamen, Signalmenand Telegraphists, may release at a faster rate while others, such as senior Seamen ratings,Regulating, Supply and Secretariat and Sick Berth branches and possibly engine room ratings,will not reach the Age and Service groups shown. Many of these ratings will be. required to operate the Release plan. u .. note (2).- This column shows the cumulative totals from the statistics furnished by thecentral index. These totals may not become available for release by the dates given owing to shipping delays and other circumstances. The figures include some men who will have already taken their release earlier in Class B or who will have been discharged on medical or other grounds ahead of their turn.Summary of Class A Releases in 1945 and 1946 (to 1st July).1945.Male   ratings   (average   A.   and   S.Group 1-28)........... 140,000Male   officers   (various   A.   and   S.Groups^       ............ 10,000W.R.N.S.&apos; (various A. and S.

If the intake for the first half of 1946 substan-tially exceeds the number of Class B releases effected in that period, furtherClass A releases will be necessary to run down to the proposed strength of 400,000men. If the intake is less than the number of Class B releases effected, fewerClass A releases will be made.
