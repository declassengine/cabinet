DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENTSECRETNO.    /CP. (45)  191 COPY NO.    /27IH SEPTEMBER,  1945CABINETRELEASES FROM THE FORGES AMD SJTPFLYBEPilRTiviENT WORK&quot;Report bv the Chairman of the ManpowerCommitteeo1.      At their meeting on the 4th September (CM. (45)  38thConclusions., Minute 3) the Cabinet invited the Man-power committee to submit a report regarding releases from theForces and Supply Department work based on the revisedappreciation made by the Chiefs of Staff of the forces required to meet our military commitments throughout theworld in the. new situation created by the surrender of Japan.2.      Releases from the Forces up to 50th June, 1946The Service Departments have estimated that in orderto -provide the Forces required to moot the revised estimates of our military commitments prepared by the Chiefs of Staff,the strengths of the throe Services at 30th Juno, 1946, willrequire, to bc:-Men and WomenNavy 415,000Army 1,156,900R.A.F. 671,000Nursing Services                                    6,C0CTOTAL 2,248,900On the basis of these strengths the releases of mcand women from each or the th.roc Services between 18thJune, 1945,  and 30th Juno.,  1946,  will bo: -431,000Army 2,076,300R.A.F. . . 448,500Nursing Services -_9,100TOTAL 2,964,900To retain 2A million men and women in the Armed Forces at mid-1946 will put a very heavy strain on our resources andthe Committee suggest that the Service Ministers should beasked to examine whether the requirements laid down by theChiefs of Staff could not be met by retaining reduced numbers in the Forces.      In particular,&apos; there seems to be scope for substantial economies in the man-power which it is proposedto retain in the Royal Air Force and, to a lesser extent,  inthe Navy.      If the review suggested does not achieve asubstantial reduction in the man-power required at 30th June,1946, the Cabinet may wish to consider whether there shouldnot be some reduction in the number of ships in commission,divisions and squadrons which the Chiefs of Staff havepostulated as necessary to meet our commitments.

The programmes of releases put forward &quot;by the service ministers for the &quot;period from 13th June, 1945, to 31st December,1945,  are as follows;--Men&apos; V,foaen Men(Glasses andA and 3) WomenNavy                        151-,500&apos;&apos;             18,000- 169,500Army                        768,100               75,000s 843,100R.A.-F. _ 20,800 45,000 __27.5,-600TOTAL 1,148,400 138,000 1,286,400x At the meeting of the Man-Power Committee on27th September the V/ar Office representativeagreed to raise the figure of 68,780 proposedin CP. (45) 175 to the figure of&apos;75,000previously proposed.Thus the total releases up to the end of 1945 would be just under1,300,000 or nearly 200,000 more- than the figure announced by theMinister of Labour in his statement at the beginning of September.The Minister of Labour fools that if we are to satisfy the men andwomen in the Services and public opinion and meet the absolutely essential needs of reconversion,  the releases up to the end of1945 should amount to not less than 1,500,000.4.      In arriving at their programmes of releases the service ministers assumed that it would ho necessary to maintain theprinciple of age and length of service.      The effect of this isto make it impossible to release men end women in this countryuntil release can bo offered to men and women in the same age and length of service group abroad,  and the rate at which this can bedone depends on the availability of shipping.      The Commit teefelt, however, that the service Ministers should review their programmes again on the assumption that the- availability ofshipping would not impose any limitation on the rate of release -and they have asked the Service Ministers to submit for considera-tion at a meeting of the Committee on Monday, 1st October,  state-sent s showing how far they can go towards releasing a further200,000 men and women on the above assumption.      The Serviceiiinistors have been asked to indicate in these statements whataffect their revised proposals- would have on the efficiency ofthe Services.5.      Shipping .The Committee were informed that while the shipping positionv/as extremely difficult, there was good hope that by the use ofthe &quot;Queens1&apos; and the &quot;Aquitania&quot; or an equivalent lift provided bythe Americans, by the adoption of exceptional measures, such asthe reduction of other services, by a very considerable lowering of the standard of comfort in trooping ships and by the maximumemployment of naval vessels,  the necessary shipping to enable thehigher target to bo reached, could be provided.It is not yet clear whether the- United States Government will agree to provide us with an equivalent lift in place of the &quot;Queensand the &quot;Aquitania&quot; but if wo fail to obtain the equivalent inother vessels the Committee consider     that we should withdraw the&apos;&apos;Quo ens&quot; and the &quot;Aquitania&quot; end make the best use of them that wesen.

6.      The Committee real-iso that shipping difficulties may-makeit impossible to achieve a figure of 1,500,000 releases by theend of 1945, but they feel that  if the task is undertaken withthe determination and resourcefulness displayed during the war there is a reasonable &quot;prospect that it can be successfullycarried out.      In any event the need for speeding up releasesis so urgent that they do not think that the Cabinet should accept a lower target.      The Government should announce thatthis is their target and that they ape taking every possible stepto provide the transport to enable it to be reached.      If wefailj we may have to consider whether some compensation shouldbe given to the men whose shipment is postponed.7.      Tt was suggested by the War Office that the releases fromthe Army in 1945 might be increased, by about 50,000 if men whohad been prisoners of war in Germany were released forthwithirrespective of their age and length of service group.      This isalready being done in.the case of former Japanese prisoners ofwar.      The admiralty and the Air Ministry see certain difficultiesin making such releases and the three Service Ministers have beer-asked to examine the War Office proposal  jointly and report on itto the Committee. &apos;8.      The Committee considered what information might be includedin the statement which the Minister of Labour and National service will have to make on the new proposals.for releases.      As theCabinet know,  there have been demands in Parliament and in thePress for the following information:-(i)  total strength of the Forces according to Services](ii)  the size of the Armed Forces in various theatres of warby Services;(iii) the programme intake for each Service for the currenthalf year;(iv) the releases proposed up to the end of 1945 and up to30th June 5  1946,. by Services,&quot;  and(v) details of the transport said shipping facilities.The Committee consider that it would be undesirable to give theinformation in (i), (ii) and (v) but see no harm in giving that required under (iii;  and (iv).9*      Releases from. Supply Department work it is estimated that, on present plans,  the numbers to beemployed on work for the Supply Departments in Group I and GroupIII industries will be 1,400*,000 by mid-1946 and 1,820,000 by theend of 1940.      These figures compare with a figure of 5,969,000 at mid-1945.      It seems essential that there should be a more rapidreduction in the numbers employed, and the Joint War production staff have been asked to prepare a revised estimate designed to effect an additional  cut  of 300,000 in the number employed.inGroup I industries at the end of 1945.      Every effort should alsobe made to reduce production for the Supply Departments in Group.Ill industries and an inquiry should bo-made into the possibilityof doing this, having regard to the stocks of clothing and other equipment which the Services have built up.      A substantial cut inthe demands of the Services on the textile and. clothing industries would be of particular value.10.    The Committee consider that it would be undesirable to makeany public announcement shout releases from the munitions industries,since any such announcement would be likely to aggravate the criticism of the rate of release from the Forces. &apos;E.B.Foreign Office, S,.Wvl,27TH SEPTEMBERiV   191+5*: -5-
