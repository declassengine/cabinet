THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET. Copy No.fCP. (45) 157.2nd October, 1945.CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST 1945 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND TFIE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.THE Dominion-Provincial Conference on Reconstruction opened at Ottawaon the 6th August. The Conference members comprise the Prime Minister andthree other Ministers, and nine Provincial Premiers. The proposals made bythe Federal Government cover a very wide field, and include every aspect of social and economic policy. The Canadian Government propose that (1) theProvinces should surrender their rights of taxation on income, estates andcorporations, with an exception of their right to tax profits from mining andlogging operations; (2) the Dominion Government should pay a minimum subsidy of 112 per capita to each province, these payments to increase as the national income increases; (3) the Dominion Government should guarantee to maintainemployment and social security at a high level; (4) social security measures should include (a) family allowances, to be financed by the Dominion Government,(b) old age pensions and joint health insurance, to be financed by both dominion and Provincial Governments and to be administered by the Provinces; (5) theDominion Government should pay unemployment insurance to employableunemployed not already covered by insurance, and that the Provinces should payrelief to unemployables; (6) the Dominion Government should co-operate withthe Provincial and Municipal Governments in carrying out a national housing programme; (7) the Dominion Government should expand existing agriculturaldevelopments, and (8) through the transition period, wage controls shouldcontinue as a guarantee against inflation.2. The basis of these proposals is finance, and hence the proposal that theProvincial Governments should surrender their rights to taxation on income, &amp;o,although a continuance of a war-time control, is a complete break with the past.Off-setting this are the generous grants which the Federal Power proposes to make to the Provincial Governments. The proposals have been unexpectedly well received, and are generally regarded as an attempt to equip Canada to play herrole in the modern world. The Conference will meet again on the 26th November :in the meanwhile the Provincial Governments will study the Dominion Govern-menfs proposals.3. General Crerar received a great welcome upon his return to canada and was presented by the Prime Minister with an illuminated address.4. Mr. Howe, Minister for Mines and Resources, said that Canadianscientists and institutions had played a prominent part in the development ofthe Atomic bomb. There are extensive deposits of uranium in Canada, and theGovernment has arranged for the supplies from all the Canadian Provinces to[30623] b
be obtained for the Crown. Steps are reported to have been taken by the Govern-ments of the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada to safeguard thepatent position by acquiring the rights to any invention made in this held.5. &apos; Following the resignation of General McNaughton as Minister ofDefence, there have been several changes in administration. Mr. D. C. Abbottsucceeds General McNaughton, and Senator Wishart Robertson becomes minister without Portfolio. Mr. E. Bertrand, formerly Minister of Fisheries, is nowPostmaster-General, and Mr. H. F. G. Bridges has been made Minister of fisheries.6. The Canadian Army and Air Force personnel who were being organisedfor action in the Pacific will soon be disbanded, as there will be no Canadianoccupation of Japan.7. His Majesty the King, on the recommendation of the Canadian Govern-ment, has approved the appointment of Field-Marshal Sir Harold Alexanderas Governor-General of Canada in succession to the Earl of Athlone. Field-Marshal Alexander will take up his appointment next spring.8. General de Gaulle paid a one-day visit to Ottawa before returning toFrance.Economic.9. On the 15th August (VJ-day in the United Kingdom) the canadian government notified the United Kingdom Government and other Governmentsconcerned that mutual aid would be ceasing immediately, and suggested that representatives should be sent to Ottawa to discuss ways and means of ensuring that the flow of food-stuffs and other civilian supplies was not interrupted. as this decision might have proved embarrassing to us in relation to the terminationof lend-lease, the Prime Minister sent a message to Mr. Mackenzie Kingexpressing the hope that it might be suspended. The Canadian authorities were also asked not to give any publicity to their decision. The Prime Minister ofCanada was sympathetic towards these requests and publicity was avoided forthe time being.10. On the 2nd September Lord Keynes arrived in Ottawa to discuss theposition with the Canadian authorities. The outcome of his negotiations was as follows :  (i) The Canadian Government agreed that mutual aid should continue upto and including the 1st September until VJ-day in the UnitedStates), and that they would waive their rights to recapture mutual-aid goods in transit on that date (which is roughly equivalent topostponing the end of mutual aid until the 12th September),(ii) The Canadian Government would assume financial responsibility forall charges arising out of the cancellation of contracts before the2nd September.(iii) The Canadian Government agreed that they would pay us for the main-tenance of their forces on a basis which was very satisfactory from our point of view.11. The effect of these arrangements is broadly that sufficient dollars willbe received from the Canadian Government to cover the purchases and otheroutgoings of the sterling area in Canada until about the end of 1945. Noarrangements have yet been made to finance purchases from Canada after thatdate, but it is expected that Lord Keynes will return to Ottawa after his negotiations in Washington have been concluded in order to deal with thisquestion.Service Activities.12. H.M.C.S. Prince Robert formed part of the force from the BritishPacific Fleet which entered Hong Kong, while HM.C.S. Ontario conveyed units from the South-East Asia Command to relieve the initial naval landing partyat this port.13. Canadian military forces continued to carry out occupational duties in North-West Europe.
14. According to the latest co-ordinated reports the three R.C.A.F.Article XV transport squadrons were located as follows : one on the continent and two in Burma. Those in Burma flew 4,300 sorties in July and 3,177 inAugust without loss.15. In July six R.C.A.F. Article XV squadrons serving with the 2nd T.A.F.in Europe were disbanded, while a further six also serving with the 2nd T.A.F.were disbanded in August.16. In addition two R.C.A.F. Article XV squadrons serving in fighter command were disbanded in August.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.17. In the Report for July, reference was made to the statements byDr. Evatt, Minister for External Affairs, on the Potsdam ultimatum. On the17th August a statement was issued by the Australian War Cabinet on Australia^participation in the Japanese surrender. It announced that the United KingdomGovernment had been informed that Australia would be prepared to furnishforces to take part in the occupation of Japan, to share responsibility with theUnited Kingdom for the command of the South-West Pacific area, and to acceptinitial responsibility for Borneo and Japanese-occupied territory to the East.The statement concluded that the War Cabinet felt that it was its duty toemphasise that, in making these contributions, Australia should be regarded not as a subsidiary, but as a principal Pacific Power, which for three and a half years had borne much of the heat and burden of the struggle against Japan. A subse-quent announcement that Australia, as a result of a direct approach to the UnitedStates Government, was to be represented at the Japanese surrender as a principal, was followed by many press comments that the United Kingdom hadnot fully supported the Australian demand and that it was only on the matterbeing taken up with the United States Government that Australia&apos;s claim hadreceived recognition.18. An important statement on Australia&apos;s plans for migration was madeby the newly appointed Minister for Immigration, Mr. Calwell, who pointed out some of the physical and economic factors which had to be considered, such as thenatural increase of population, and that past experience had proved that themaximum effective population absorption capacity of Australia was about 2 j)ercent., which meant a migration ceiling of about 70,000 a year. Mr. Calwellemphasised that three matters of major importance had to be dealt with before any organised plan of large-scale immigration was possible. These were the rehabilitation and re-employment of men and women from the Australianservices; the provision of additional housing; and the provision of adequateshipping to bring new citizens to Australia. Two draft agreements betweenthe Commonwealth and the United Kingdom Governments had been approved;one covered a free passage to Australia for British ex-servicemen andwomen, the other covered assisted passages to civilians in the United Kingdomwho were not eligible under the free-passage scheme. As regards child migration,the Government had approved a plan for bringing to Australia in the first threeyears after the war 50,000 orphans from Britain and other countries devastatedby war.19. Various measures have been announced for the release of man-powercontrols, i.e., the repeal of the power of direction of labour not considered essentialto speedy re-establishment of discharged service personnel and civilian warworkers, and the freedom to engage labour without permit for a number ofindustries. In effect, however, the only persons free to take employment of theirown choosing are ex-service personnel, persons under 18 years of age, and thosequalified and willing to work in industries on the specified list. Demobilisationis to begin on the 1st October on a points system.20. The Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, and the Banking Act 1945, came into operation on the 21st August. In the case of the former the IndustrialFinance .and Housing Loans Sections, which are functions additional to those at present conducted by the Bank, will only operate when the administrative staff is complete.21.   In the Second Reading debate on the Australian Air Lines Bill (seereport for July, paragraph 7), Mr. Chifley, the Prime Minister, said that the[30623] b 2
nationalisation of Australian air lines will not operate until after the elections,which are to be held late next year.22. Important decisions affecting Australia^ post-war development weremade at a conference of Commonwealth and State Premiers held at Canberraduring August. The Conference endorsed a priority programme of post-warworks at an estimated cost of  A.193 million, which had been recommended bythe National Works Council. It was also agreed that legislation should be intro-introduced for the transfer of price control by the States to the Commonwealth forthree years. A committee was set up to consider the question of the unification of railway gauges and to consider the division of financial responsibility between commonwealth and States. In reply to a proposal by Mr. Dunstan, Premier ofVictoria, that the system of uniform income taxation by the Commonwealth, intro-duced as a wartime measure, should be repealed, Mr. Chifley, Prime Minister ofthe Commonwealth, said that he saw no possibility of repealing uniform taxa-tion because Commonwealth expenditure on war services must long remain high.23. The Commonwealth Government intend to proceed vigorously with thedevelopment of the Australian shipbuilding industry. It is expected that theinter-State coastal trade will be reserved for Australian-built ships. A plannednaval production programme will also be undertaken.24. A  A.30 million hydro-electric scheme covering the Snowy River in new South Wales and Victoria is at present under consideration.25. A Fourth Victory Loan of  A.85 million is to be floated on the25th September.26. Speaking after the Fremantle bye-election, which resulted in a clear majority for the Labour candidate, the Prime Minister said that the resultshowed that the people clearly endorsed the Governments record and agreed with the policies which have been carried out. Labour was also successful intwo State bye-elections, in New South Wales and Victoria.27. Coal strikes have been almost continual in Australia since within sixmonths of the outbreak of the war, and only at the height of the Pacific crisiswas full production obtained. On the eve of the Japanese surrender, a strike atthe South Maitland, New South Wales, field had so endangered the coal position that rationing was threatened.28. The Governor-General, H.R.H. The Duke of Gloucester, has been ordered a complete rest for approximately two months by his medical advisers,and has accordingly cancelled his tour to the Northern Territory, the only large area of Australia which he has not visited since his arrival in January, and alsothe continuation of his tour of New Guinea and Borneo, which was interrupted by Mr. Curtin&apos;s death. H.R.H. hopes to be able to make his Victorian tour as planned, in mid-November.29. It has been announced that when Mr. S. M. Bruce relinquishes hispost as Australian High Commissioner in London, Mr. J. A. Beasley would proceed to London as Resident Minister for a short period. Pending Mr. Beasley&apos;arrival in London, Dr. Evatt, Minister of External Affairs, who is representingAustralia in London during the meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers,will, on Mr. Bruce&apos;s retirement, act as High Commissioner.Service A activities.30. H.M.A.S. Lithgow picked up the Japanese Lieutenant-General Kaudaon Bougainville and took him to the Australian Headquarters at Torokina.31. H.M.A. Ships Nizam and Napier (destroyers) were included in the force from the British Pacific Fleet which sailed into Sagami Bay.32. During the various surrender operations H.MA. Ships Shropshire andHolart (cruisers), Warramunga and Bataan (destroyers) took part in the Tokyoceremony, while H.M.A. minesweepers Broome, Bathurst, Mudura, Wagga, Castle-maine, Strahan and Freemantle formed part of the force which entered HongKong.33. In the S.W.P.A. fighting continued after the surrender announcementmade on the 14th August, and it was not until the 21st that a message was receivedby the General Officer Commanding First Australian Army from the Commander-in-Chief,   South-East  Japanese  Army,  and   Commander-in-Chief,   Japanese
&quot; 80 Area &quot; Command, stating that every endeavour was being made to get thecease fire to all areas and requesting Allied assistance to this end. By the 25than armed truce existed in New Guinea, the Solomons and New Britain, on which date it was estimated that there were 13,000 Japanese troops on Bougainville,9,000 on New Guinea, 55,000 on New Britain, and 9,000 on New Ireland.34. In particular in the southern sector of Bougainville the enemy strongly resisted the operations of the Third Australian Division, while in the northern and central sectors a number of patrol clashes took place. Gn New Guinea, wherethe enemy were steadily retreating, no slackening of resistance was encounteredby troops of the Sixth Australian Division during the first half of the month;strong counter-attacks were, in fact, &quot;being launched by the Japanese after the surrender announcement on the 14th August.35. On Borneo in the Brunei Bay, Balikpapan, and Tarakan sectors troops of the 7th and 9th Australian Divisions reported all quiet with the exception of limited patrol activity.36. Further squadrons of the R.A.A.F. have moved forward and are now operating from airfields in Borneo. The First Australian T.A.F., comprisingsome eight wings of three squadrons each, has one heavy bomber and three fighter and fighter-bomber wings operating from Balikpapan and three fighter wingsbased on Labuan, while other ancillary units are also in these areas.37. Nine Article XV squadrons of the R.A.A.F. were operating in theEuropean and Middle East Theatres at the beginning of the month, and of thesesix are now in the United Kingdom, one in North-West Europe, and one in theMiddle East, while one was disbanded in the Middle East towards the end of themonth.38.   On the 15th July, 25,142 men and 8,470 women were engaged in aircraft production in Australia, and the following figures show the aircraft produced; during July and cumulative totals for Australian aircraft production up to the31st July:- Total to july Delivery.

The New Zealand House of Representatives, after a three-day debate on the San Francisco Conference, ratified the United Nations Charter and constitution of the Court of International Justice, one National member abstainingfrom voting. Moving the resolution, the Prime Minister, Mr. Fraser, said thatthere had been no attempt at San Francisco to form a British Dominions bloc.The Dominions representatives had felt they could speak and vote as they pleased,and the bonds between the British Dominions had been in no way weakened, but rather strengthened. Mr. Fraser explained that the provision of Armed forces under the Charter would be settled by negotiation, and any New Zealand commit-ment under it would be duly submitted to Parliament.40. In his Budget speech on the 9th August, the Minister of Finance,Mr. Nash, announced that provision had been made for increases in all formsof pensions and social security benefits, and that it is the Government&apos;s aim to provide a minimum family allowance of  5 a week during sickness, unemploy-ment or imvalidism. The Budget was criticised by the press for the undue increasein the cost of social security, and for the failure to economise in the cost of the armed Forces.41. With the conclusion of the war against Japan, the War Cabinet, whichhad formerly contained representatives of the Opposition, has been abolished.The two National Party members, Mr. A. Hamilton, Minister for War Expendi-ture, and Mr. W. Perry, Minister for the Armed Forces, have accordinglytendered their resignations.
42. Many war-time labour controls are to be abandoned at once. Mr. AngusMcLagan, Minister for Manpower, announced this when he said that all marriedwomen, irrespective of age, all single women over 30, and all men over 45, wereto be exempted from further direction. Married women wishing to return home will receive immediate consent to leave essential industries, the list of whichwill be drastically reduced by the end of the year.43. The Minister for Defence, Mr. F. Jones, has announced that to speedup demobilisation 25,000 personnel of the R.N.Z.A.F. would be released duringthe next six months.44. Ten thousand Trade Unionists demonstrated in support of the Govern-ment&apos;s proposal to nationalise the Bank of New Zealand, when a small deputa-tion of business men went to Parliament House with resolutions of protest againstthe proposal from organisations throughout New Zealand. The Prime minister in reply to the deputation affirmed that legislation would be introduced as announced.45. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Holland, requested in Parliament,on the 1st August, that an invitation be extended to Mr. Churchill to visit NewZealand as soon as possible. In reply, Mr. Nash said that an invitation hadalready been extended to Mr. Churchill by Mr. Fraser when he was in Britain,and that it was hoped that Mr. and Mrs. Churchill would come.Service Activities.46. H.M.N.Z.S. Gambia (Cruiser) formed part of the force from the BritishPacific Fleet which sailed into Sagami Bay.47. The Second New Zealand Division continued to carry out occupationalduties in Italy during the month of August.48. A further R.N.Z.A.F. Article XV squadron located in Europe hasbeen disbanded during the course of the month.49. Fourteen R.N.Z.A.F. squadrons were still located in the South-west pacific Area, of which five were based in New Zealand.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.50. Speaking at a reception for the Aga Khan in Pretoria, Field-marshal smuts said on the 9th August : &quot; We stand at the stage in human history that must make us pause and think. We have reached in this year, 1945, a stagewhich is crucial for human history. We see now that war and the weapons ofwar call for a complete stocktaking and recasting of our views on war. I hopethat with the work we have done at San Francisco, and the atomic bomb, mankindis learning its lesson.&quot; Field-Marshal Smuts again spoke of his anxiety forthe success of the San Francisco Conference, when he addressed his constituentsat Standerton. He then said that his work at that Conference had been donein the name of South Africa, and that he believed that, with the same spiritas his country had faced the war, she would build up a united South Africa,which would become one great nation.51. Referring to the question of Indians in South Africa, at the receptionto the Aga Khan, the Prime Minister said : &quot; We shall put our heads together tosee whether we can settle these difficulties.&quot; Field-Marshal Smuts emphasised that, whatever disagreements existed between the two sections of the community,they did not represent a serious trouble. He added that there were now veiygood prospects of the Indians in India reaching their goal of Dominion status.52. When Field-Marshal Smuts visited Natal to receive the freedom of the!City of Durban, he said that South Africa was a &quot;laboratory for a problemof the whole world : We are trying to solve the problem of racial harmony.&quot;!If in South Africa they could achieve harmonious co-operation, it would provide!&apos;a precedent for the whole world to follow, and would enable South Africa tofplay a greater part in the foundation of lasting peace.53. The necessity for working towards a national food service programmedin peace-time was stressed by Mr. H. G. Lawrence, Minister of Welfare!and Demobilisation, when he opened the national conference on Nutrition and!Disease.
54. Mr. Pirow, the leader of the New Order, recently told a Conferenceof National Socialists in Johannesburg that war against Russia was an urgent necessity.55. A riot of South African troops recently occurred at Helwan Camp inEgypt, as a protest at the delay in their repatriation. It is regarded as a symptomof the general dissatisfaction with the Union Governments handling of housing and other problems.56. A system of river waterways in Northern Bechuanaland, serving an area of more than 10,000 square miles, where to-day only crude sand tracts runthrough bush country, is suggested by Dr. D. F. Kokot, of the Union IrrigationDepartment, now with the Kalahari Expedition.Service A activities.57. The Sixth South African Armoured. Division continued to carry outoccupational duties in Northern Italy.58. Five S.A.A.F. Bomber Squadrons were stationed in the central mediterranean comprising two Liberator Squadrons based on Cellone and threeMarauder Squadrons stationed at Rivolto.59. Eight further S.A.F. Squadrons were in the Central mediterranean theatre, four being single-seater fighter, fighter reconnaissance or ground attacksquadrons, equipped with Spitfires, Mustangs, or Kittyhawks, while theremaining four were made up of one Squadron for photo reconnaissance equipped with Mosquitoes, one for general reconnaissance equipped with Venturas, andI two for transport duties equipped with Dakotas.60. In the Middle East two general reconnaissance Squadrons of theS.A.A.F. equipped with Warwicks were stationed at Gianaclis near Alexandriafrom where one is scheduled to return to the Union in the near future.61. The S.A.A.F. flying boat Squadron is still operational under AirCommand, South-East Asia, and is based on Durban.62. Two wings of transport aircraft totalling some 160 planes are operating in South Africa while one G/R Squadron of Venturas is also stationed in theUnion.EIRE.63. Two hundred and fifty-four German Servicemen who had been internedby the Eire authorities during the war left Dublin on the 13th August forthe British zone of occupation in Germany. The total number of Germansinterned at the Curragh was 266 but ten broke their parole and two were reported to be too sick to travel.Economic.64. The Eire Trade returns for the seven months ended 31st July showincreases in both imports and exports as compared with 1944. The value ofimports was  21-5 million and of exports  17-9 million compared with  16-4 million and  14-7 million respectively in the same period of 1944.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.65. The widespread disappointment created in July by the failure of theSimla Conference was dispelled by the unexpected news of the advent of theLabour Government with an overwhelming majority. The wave of hopefulnessand expectation which followed was heightened by the decision to summon theViceroy to London for consultation and by the announcement that general elections for both the Central and the Provincial Legislatures would be held inthe coming cold weather. These decisions were interpreted as signs that thenew Government meant business and that the elections were to be understood as a prelude to the setting up of a constitution-making body in accordance withthe programme outlined in the Draft Declaration of 1942.
66.   The announcement regarding the elections was warmly welcomed by the!Moslem League which looks to them to demonstrate that the League, particularly Iin its policy of Pakistan, is the only organisation truly representative of Moslem Iopinion.   The Congress Party at the outset were less enthusiastic, but with theremoval of the bans on Congress organisations, they are now free to throw their Ienergies into the preparations for an election campaign which will be the dominant political interest in India for months to come.Frontier and Foreign Relations.67.   The North-West Frontier. At the instigation of the Faqir of Ipi ajstrong well-armed band of hostiles attacked the territories of the Manzar Khel,an important Wazir tribe, in order to punish them for their assistance toGovernment.   As a result of the stout resistance of the tribe, the movement!collapsed.   Otherwise all was quiet and no general repercussions had beenreported so far to disturbances across the Afghan border in the Kunar valley,   j68.   Afghanistan. The disturbance in the Kunar area of the Eastern!Province, mentioned in last month&apos;s report, flared up again after a lull and!some British tribesmen are reported by the Afghan Government to be assisting Ithe rebels.   At the request of the Afghan Government political pressure wasapplied by the N.W.F.P. authorities to call off the lashkars.69.   The Afghan Prime Minister made an urgent personal request to His jMajesty&apos;s Representative, Kabul, for air action against the insurgent tribesmen, which the Governor of the North-West Frontier Province has been authorised by the Government of India to take, after due warning.   The uncertainty of the Idelimitation of the respective responsibilities of the Governments of India andof Afghanistan for the tribes in this area forms an additional complication.70.   Nepal. Congratulatory messages were exchanged on the Japanesesurrender.71. Persian Gulf. A new7 British section of the Bahrein State Police has jrecently been formed. The Police force numbering about 350 has hithcu-to beencomposed entirely of Arabs, and the British section consisting of eight police officers seconded from police forces in this country should be better suited fordealing with the increasing European and American population of the Islands, they will also act as instructors for the Arab police and assist in introducingmeasures of traffic control.Economic.72. The prospects of the main (&quot; Aman &quot;) rice crop in Bengal, which isharvested in November-December, and represents about three-quarters of thetotal annual production in this Province, have been causing anxiety owing to the partial failure of the monsoon. Recent rain has, however, improved the prospects of this crop and, provided weather and crop conditions continue favourable,particularly in October, it is now hoped that the out-turn may amount to 80 percent, of normal. Apart from the dangers of food shortage in this densely populated province, where famine conditions prevailed in 1943-44, the rice deficit jareas in the West and South of India have been largely dependent on Bengal ricesince the cutting off of the normal peace-time supplies imported from Burma.Much may therefore depend on the extent to which the existing surplus of rice in jBurma can again be made available to meet India&apos;s needs.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.73. Royal Indian Navy. The first half of August, that is prior to VJ-day,was chiefly taken up with routine patrolling in the Eastern part of the indian ocean, and in preparation for operations against the mainland of Malaya. SinceVJ-day, in addition to routine patrolling, the Royal Indian Navy, in conjunctionwith East Indies Fleet, has been preparing for the occupation of Penang and iSingapore.74.   Military. Despite the surrender of Japan there was sporadic offensive action by the Japanese Forces, both in Southern Burma and in the Karen Hillsthroughout the latter part of the month.   This was due mainly to the difficulties 1of communication which prohibited early information of the surrender being I
broadcast to small, unorganised and ill-equipped forces of the enemy. Japaneselosses, particularly during the first half of the month, were extremely heavy.75. The sudden surrender, coming when it did, forestalled by a very short time the operations against the mainland of Malaya, and in consequence the latter part of the month was devoted to routine planning and regrouping of formationsfor occupational duties.76. Air. Despite the monsoon weather the R.A.F., and R.I.A.F. were heavily engaged throughout the month in reconnaissance and supply-droppingduties, in addition to the considerable number of offensive sorties prior to the surrender, and, latterly, in consequence of the failure to surrender of certain smallenemy parties and formations.General.77. Morale.-There has, so far, been no regrettable reaction to the simultaneous announcements by Admiral Mountbatten and General Auchinleckconcerning unavoidable delays in Python releases.78. The hope of accelerated release or repatriation, consequent on theJapanese surrender, was the main preoccupation of the British troops, althoughAdmiral Mountbatten&apos;s special order of the day has made it quite clear thatthere is little justification for undue optimism.79. On the other hand, Indian troops&apos; reactions to the end of hostilities arechiefly concerned with the numbers among them who may be permitted to continueserving in all three Services, but particularly the Indian Army.80. It is expected that the back-log of beer in the United Kingdom will all be cleared by next month, and, transportation in India permitting, that the full allowance will become available for all entitled ranks.by the end of September.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Enemy-Occupied Burma.81. Many of the Japanese forces still in Burma did not hear of the offer of surrender, and some of those who did were reluctant to accept it for some time.Fighting, however, was on a much reduced scale, as S.E.A.C. suspended activeoffensive operations. The news gradually percolated, and at the end of the monththings were generally quiet.Liberated Burma.82. Political groups are losing their temporary cohesion and are manceu-vring for position. The Thakin Party has split into three groups &quot;Communists,&quot;&apos;&apos; Social Democrats,&quot; and an intermediate group. On the other side, several parties have revived, but some of them, including the Myochit (U Saw&apos;s) Party, aretainted with collaboration and lack respectable leaders. The various parties,however, are reported to be getting together to compile a list of persons to proposefor the Governor&apos;s Executive Council. The Karens still remain firmly aloof fromthe other parties and are apprehensive of their future lest self-government should place them at the mercy of the Burmese.83. Though reports of incidents and lawlessness continue, the general crimesituation is in some areas improving. There are disquieting reports of variousterrorist organisations and there is open talk amongst the Communists of attack -ing the British and Indians in Burma if complete political freedom is not granted.84. Economic conditions throughout the country vary. In Rangoon a relaxation of price control has led to an increase of goods for sale at exorbitantprices. There are indications that Rangoon is beginning to come to life again,with roads and buildings being repaired, public utilities working and smallBurman shops springing up everywhere. Good progress is being made in restoring the railways.[30623] c
THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note.-In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &apos;&apos; Colonial Governors &apos;&apos; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.Ceylon.85. Owing to drought and late cultivation, Ceylon&apos;s internal purchasecollections of rice are expected to be less than previously estimated. To meet this deficiency the Government of Ceylon have asked for an additional riceimport this year of 40,000 tons. The importance of rice to Ceylon is fully recognised, but while the world shortage of rice continues, it is difficult to see how it can be met.Relief and Rehabilitation, Malaya, Hong Kong and the british territories in N. Borneo.86. The Colonial Office is responsible for the procurement of supplies forthe second six months of liberation and for certain items in respect of the first six months. The Japanese surrender, by advancing the date of the liberation of these territories and making it simultaneous with all other occupied territories in the Far East is likely to create difficulties in meeting the require-ments of the population for consumer goods, especially those in short supply. Itwill thus be necessary to ensure that special consideration is given to the needsof these territories from now on, and, in this connection, it must be rememberedthat we are looking to Malaya and to a more limited extent to the british territories in North Borneo, to supply commodities such as rubber, oils and fatswhich are so urgently required throughout the world. Malaya is also a producer of tin and, with her rubber and tin exports to the United States, she was animportant contributor to our foreign exchange resources before the japanese occupation at the rate of 12 million American dollars per month during 1939.Defence.African Troops in the Far East.87. At the time of the Japanese surrender there were still over 100,000West and East African troops serving in Burma, India and Ceylon. These troopsplayed a prominent part in the liberation of Burma. In particular, the successfuladvances of the 11th East African Division down the Kabaw Valley in the 1944monsoon, and of the 81st and 82nd West African Divisions in the Arakan, were most valuable achievements which drew high praise from campaign Commanders.Revocation of the Defence Regulations regarding the detention and control of suspected persons.88. Defence Regulation 18a was revoked at VE-day in all colonial territories except Ceylon, the Western Pacific Territories, Mauritius andSeychelles. It has now been revoked in all but Mauritius, where it is still necessary in order to continue to detain Stoyadinovitch, and Seychelles where itsrevocation is under consideration with the Governor.89.

Censorship of all kinds ceased in all Colonial territories a few days after VJ-day except for Ceylon, Palestine, and Terminal censorship in Gibraltar,which may continue until the 30th September. Internal censorship in Tanganyikais still under consideration.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.93. The Japanese surrender caused mild excitement, but did not interruptcontinued attention to local politics. The initial anticipation by both communitiesthat the change of Government as the result of British Elections would immediately produce reorientation of policy as regards Palestine quickly gaveway to more realistic reflections on the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The knowledge that the problem will be reconsidered is manifest in increasednervous tension on both sides. Jewish satisfaction with the propagandist valueof the Zionist Conference in London, especially with its maximalist demand, wasdiminished by regret at the inevitable clash between Dr. Weizmann and Mr. BenGriirion. Impatience at the absence of a favourable declaration of policy byHis Majesty&apos;s Government was marked. The Zionist demand and Jewish inter -pretation of President Truman&apos;s statement on Palestine have markedly hardenedArab opinion. Jewish opinion, while welcoming the Presidents statement onI immigration, resented the reservation on the employment of American military\ ! forces, because of the double implication that military forces might be necessaryR and that the ultimate responsibility lies with His Majesty&apos;s Government.94. An attempt by the Amir Abdullah to achieve union of Party LeadersH in some form of higher committee failed through the insistence of the PalestineI i Arab Party on their rights as trustees of the political principles of Haj Amin(the Mufti) and Jamal Husseini, now interned in Southern Rhodesia. There is,I ! however, a stage of coherence of policy and action among Arabs and no lack ofI j unity vis-a-vis Zionism.95.

On the 16th August,I Police captured personnel of the Irgun Zvai Leumi (National Military Organisa-pl tion) trained unit with arms, explosives, &amp;c, in Haifa District. Other anti-ij terrorist measures included 134 anti-terrorist raids 40 persons were detainedI I and the total number detained on the 20th August was 435.96. The erection of Army huts for immediate relief of the housing crisisI in Tel-Aviv is proceeding, and a scheme for 300 houses there for ex-Service menI j  is under consideration.I \  Nigeria.I Strike of Technical Workers.97.

The Acting Governor has removed the ban on the publication of theIff Lagos newspapers West African Pilot and Daily Comet.f: Malta.99.   On the 31st July all elected members following the leader of the Con-\ \  stitutional Party resigned from the Council of Government on the grounds thatI ! elections under the 1939 Constitution, which, they inferred from the Speech fromthe Throne, the Governor intended to hold, would unnecessarily defer the returnI &apos; of responsible Government.

They were liberated by the Russians at Hsian, 100miles north of Mukden, on or before the 22nd August. The complete facts arenot available, but it appears that the Russians sent these officers to Mukden andthere handed them over to the American team dropped by parachute under instructions from General Wedemeyer. They were later flown to Chungking.I sent to Sir Shenton Thomas and Sir Mark Young a message of greeting, whichthey each acknowledged from Chungking.103.
