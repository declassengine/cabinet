i&apos;HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September1945;SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 160.10th September, 1945.CABINET.INDUSTRIAL DISARMAMENT OF GERMANY.Memorandum by the Chairman of the Overseas Reconstruction Committee.AT their meeting* on the 15th June, 1945, the Cabinet approved, for the guidance of the British representatives on the Reparations Commission and onthe Control Commission for Germany, certain proposals! as regards the initialmeasures to be taken for the destruction of Germany&apos;s industrial war potential,but deferred consideration of the more detailed proposals.2. We have now given further consideration^: to these detailed proposals,in the light of the decisions reached at the Berlin Conference and of the views expressed by the German Science and Industry Committee and the british element of the Control Commission for Germany. Accordingly at Annex is adraft Statement of Policy on Industrial Disarmament, comprising certain prin-ciples which it is suggested should govern our. policy; a programme of immediate measures; and some observations on a longer term policy. The Statement at annex is based on the following assumptions, which are vital to the whole scheme : (a) Germany will be prohibited for an indefinite period from maintainingarmed forces, possessing arms and munitions or maintaining plant for their manufacture;(b) Germany will not be dismembered, though important territories willbe ceded to neighbouring States; in particular, the Rheno-Westphalianindustrial district will not be withdrawn from the German economiccomplex;(c) Germany will not be occupied indefinitely, but for a sufficiently long period (not less than ten years) to allow the changes in her industrial structure, which will result from the measures we have recommended,to have a chance of becoming permanently established.3. We have also invited the Directorate of Tube Alloys (D.S.I.R.) to concertarrangements with the British Element of the Control Commission so that the study, which is contemplated, of the German chemical and engineering industriesmay be carried out with full regard to the importance of these industries for the exploitation of nuclear energy.4. Our immediate purpose is to achieve security against the possibility of future German aggression, and we are therefore proposing a drastic policy overa selected field of German industry with a view to eliminating the basis ofGermany&apos;s industrial war potential. We recognise that there is another aspect of our policy towards German industry which must be examined, viz., theeconomic and trade aspects from the point of view of British exports and balanceof payments. We are therefore arranging for a study of this longer term aspect of our policy to be prepared.5. The British representatives on the Control Commission for Germany andon the Reparations Commission are in urgent need of definite instructions as toour immediate policy towards German industry, and we therefore recommendthat the Cabinet should approve the annexed Statement of Policy on IndustrialDisarmament.(Intld.)

ANNEX.Draft Statement of Policy on Industrial Disarmament.I. Principles..1. The purpose of industrial disarmament is to make it more difficult for germany, after the occupation is over, to put herself in a position where she couldonce again wage war, and easier for the United Nations to detect and prevent any efforts which she may make to do so. Industrial disarmament should be of thegreatest value to the United Nations, by lengthening the time between the startand the fruition of Germany&apos;s rearmament, so that action can be taken at once to prevent it with little cost to ourselves. But it does not in itself furnish security or avert the need for armed force. It may be possible during the comparatively short period of our occupation to take measures which will have far-reachingconsequences for the German economy and so to set up natural forces which, will tend to give the German economy a more peaceful bias, particularly if at thesame time we can ensure that the Germans themselves have an interest in continueddevelopment on peaceful lines. Nevertheless action taken during the occupationcan in the course of time be reversed by the Germans, unless their will for war has been so far removed that they do not make the attempt, or unless we forbidthem to do so. If we do the latter, the effectiveness of our prohibition rests inthe last resort on our willingness and ability to use armed force to impose our willand punish any breach of our prohibition.2. It follows from this that our policy for industrial disarmament deservesa very high priority among our aims. But it must be so designed as to command the support of public opinion in all the democratic countries for a generationahead a support sufficiently strong and continuous to make the country willing touse force as a sanction whenever the need arises. Short of that, the system will fail at the moment when it is put to the test. The danger will come, not in thenext few years, when Germany will be held down by the occupation, but later.3. Equally, the system of industrial security should not be so oppressiveto the Germans as to lead to long lasting unemployment and destitution. Such acondition would only give an opportunity to another dictator to seize power ona programme of national revenge. This implies that peaceful and harmlessdevelopment of industry must be encouraged so as to ensure a modicum of contentamong the German population. If a given set of measures will in themselvesachieve our object, there is no need to add further measures which will increaseGermany&apos;s poverty and discontent without materially adding to security. Anadditional reason for not going further on the road to complete de-industrialisa-tion is that to do so would act against our own interests as occupying Powers. the resulting unrest and poverty would add to our commitments and might evenleave Germany dependent for bare existence on the charity of the world.4. A clear distinction should be drawn between measures imposed forpurposes of security, and other measures which may be adopted for reparation orother reasons. The former should be carried out regardless of their effect on germany&apos;s capacity to make reparation for the damage she has done, or of thedifficulties they may create for the occupying Powers; this fact in itself shouldmake us chary of adding beyond necessity to the number of measures which enjoythis over-riding priority. Measures wmich may be proposed for reparation orother reasons should only be carried out with due regard to their effect on theGerman economy.5. We should rely so far as possible on action taken and completed withinthe period of occupation, which carries with it the seeds of permanence and stability. After that period the number and scope of restrictions which we canin practice enforce will be limited, and they must appear plainly justified in the eyes of the later generation on whom the burden of enforcement will fall.6. With these considerations in view, His Majesty&apos;s Government havereached the conclusion that their aims could best be achieved by adopting a drasticpolicy over a selected field of German industry with a view to eliminating thebasis of Germany&apos;s war potential. As for the rest of German industry, they recognise the importance of removing plant and machinery rendered surplus bythe imposition of the drastic measures referred to above and of eliminating
other excess capacity built up for war purposes : but they consider, for the reasonsquoted above, that any policy of excessive de-industrialisation would be likely to defeat our own ends.II. Short-term, programme.7. Until a thorough investigation of the industrial war potential ofGermany has taken place on the spot, it will not be possible to prepare a completeprogramme of measures of elimination or restriction; but an initial: programmecan be prepared at once of measures for dealing with certain industries whichare so important to the war potential of Germany that there could be no reasonfor delay in dealing with them pending more detailed examination of the wholefield.8. His Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly propose that the following initialmeasures should be applied : -(a) Civil Aircraft. Elimination of manufacturing capacity andprohibition of production of civil aircraft (including gliders), aero-engines,components and accessories special to aircraft and aero-engines. prohibition on the possession or operation of civil aircraft.(b) Merchant Shipbuilding and Repairs. Removal of up-to-date equip-ment from shipyards. Prohibition of the building of sea-going vessels otherthan small fishing vessels for Germany&apos;s approved requirements and such other special purpose vessels as may be approved. Reduction in capacity tobuild inland watercraft to normal peaceful needs. Reduction of the ship-repairing industry, as soon as circumstances permit, until it does not exceed the size necessary to meet the minimum requirements of ships trading to german ports.(c) Merchant Shipping. On the assumption that all German merchant ships other than those essential for her coastal and short sea traffic will be handed over to the Allies, the prohibition of shipbuilding coupled with theexercise of Allied controls to prevent Germany from acquiring ships fromabroad will prevent Germany from reconstituting her mercantile marine.(d) Steel. Reduction of capacity to 50 per cent, of pre-war capacity of23 million tons.(e) Machine Tools. Elimination of manufacturing capacity surplus topeaceful domestic requirements and prohibition of exports from current production. Reduction of machine tool holdings to requirements, of peacefulengineering industry.(f) Ball and Roller Bearings. Elimination of manufacturing capacity and prohibition of production.(g) Ammonia and Methanol Produced by High Pressure Hydrogenation. Elimination of manufacturing capacity and prohibition of production.(h) Synthetic Oil. Elimination of manufacturing capacity andprohibition of production.9. These measures should be carried out with due regard to the needs of technical and economic intelligence. In general, the measures which may beadopted for the destruction or elimination of sectors of German industry shouldbe put in hand immediately and should only be postponed in cases where supplyconsiderations render this imperative. Of the industries listed in paragraph 8,probably the only ones where such postponement will be necessary are the manu-facture&quot; of ammonia, which is urgently required for food production,ship-repairing and the manufacture of ball and roller bearings.10. The list of measures set forth in paragraph 8 is not exhaustive. Otherindustries which also contribute to the war potential of Germany in particular the remainder of the chemical industry (including synthetic rubber), engineering,light metals, other non-ferrous metals, precision and optical instruments andradio are being examined urgently by the Control Commission (British Element)with a view to determining whether any further measure of restriction, beyond those referred to in paragraph 11 below, are necessary to furnish a significantaddition to the security which would be expected to result from the impositionof the specific measures set out in paragraph 8.11. In addition to the industries for which specific measures of restrictionor elimination are necessary, there will also be a large number of industries,particularly in the engineering field, which will have been expanded for war
purposes beyond any peaceful needs. The restrictions to be imposed will alsorender surplus much plant in related industries. All such surplus plant shouldbe removed or destroyed after investigation on the spot.YYL.-Long-term policy.12. For the most part, it is not possible to reach conclusions at this stageon long-term policy in the field of industrial disarmament, beyond the general conclusions in Part I of this note. Policy in this respect must be fitted into the framework provided by political decisions yet to be taken, and must be co-co-ordinated with other requirements- which may be placed on Germany in the economic field.Nor is it necessary to reach firm conclusions now, if a satisfactory interimprogramme is established. There are, however, two points on which it is possibleto reach provisional conclusions.13. Many of the measures to be taken are designed to have their full or maineffect during the period of occupation, when direct control can be exercised.Prohibitions and restrictions to be indirectly imposed through the medium of provisions in the Peace Treaty, as has been said in paragraph 5, should be limited in number and scope and should be directed at a few vital industries : and, inorder that such provisions may be effectively enforced, it is advisable that theyshould totally prohibit a given industry rather than place quantitative limitations on it and should refer to industries which are not easily distributed among anumber of small plants.14. With this in view, His Majesty&apos;s Government have reached the following conclusions as regards the duration of the controls listed in paragraph 8 above :  (a) to be continued indefinitely : civil aircraft, synthetic oil and ammonia andmethanol produced by high pressure hydrogenation,(b) to be continued for the period of occupation (not less than ten years) :steel, machine tools, ball and roller bearings,(c) to be continued until further notice : merchant ship-building and repairs(and, consequentially, merchant shipping).These provisional decisions can be taken as assumptions for the purpose of planning the administration of the controls.15. Any programme of industrial disarmament may be put out of date bythe progress of scientific knowledge and industrial applications. In a few years&apos;time, war potential may be based on quite different industries from those mentionedabove. This is not an immediate problem, while the controlling Powers haveunlimited authority under the Declaration of Defeat and also the power to enforceit by means of their armies of occupation. But it is a matter that will need careful consideration before any Peace Treaty is signed.
