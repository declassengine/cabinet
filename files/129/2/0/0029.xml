SECRET. Copy Ntf. 0 &apos;c.p.. (45) 179.18th September, 1945.CABINET.POLITICAL AFFAIRS IN SOUTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I think my colleagues will be interested to read the annexed copy of a personal letter from Sir Evelyn Baring, United Kingdom High commissioner in the Union of South Africa, giving a very comprehensive survey of. the back-ground to South African politics.Sir Evelyn Baring is at the same time High Commissioner for Basutoland,the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland, and, in this capacity, he hasincluded at the end of his letter a description of conditions in those three territories.A.Dominions Office, S:W. 1,18th September, -1945.Office of the High Commissionerfor the United Kingdom,Dear Secretary of State, - Pretoria, 22nd A ugust, 1945-.May I respectfully offer you the best, wishes of myself and my staff on theoccasion of your assumption of office&apos;.2. I am afraid that. South Africa is a country which will produce manythorny problems for you. As you know, the present Government is a Coalition onecomposed of three elements. The first is the old South Africa Party of Bothaand Smuts. The Party was in opposition from 1924, when the Nationalists wona sensational general election, until 1933. At the end of that year the economiccrisis arising from General Hertzog&apos;s action in keeping South Africa on the goldstandard after Great Britain had gone off led to the establishment of a &quot; FusionGovernment.&quot; But Dr. Malan took the extreme Nationalists into opposition.On the outbreak of war the &quot; Fusion Government &quot; split. When the House votedon Hertzog&apos;s neutrality policy a few members previously considered as followersof Hertzog came over to Smuts (who obtained a majority of 13 on the war issue),but the remainder broke away. They have been in opposition ever since. At onetime they formed a separate party. But now most of them are with Malan&apos;sfollowers in the fold of a single Nationalist organisation. The second element isthe Labour Party led by Mr. Madeley. All its members represent urbanconstituencies; In the past its strength has been drawn largely from English-speaking South Africans. But an increasing number of Afrikaans-speakingpeople now belong to the Labour Party and it will be interesting to watch theprogress the Party makes in the future among Afrikaners. The third elementis the Dominion Party led by Colonel Stallard. The Dominion Party members have all been elected for Natal constituencies. They represent the extreme&apos;1 British &apos;&apos; point of view, and in my personal opinion the Party has no futurebefore it.3. The United Party Government is dominated by the personality ofGeneral Smuts. Needless to say, he is freely and often criticised. The burden ofthe charge is that his interest in world politics causes him to neglect SouthAfrican affairs in general and economic and social problems in particular, that[30537] b---    114Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.
he is dictatorial and that he has not picked good men. for his Cabinet. But south africans generally are very proud of his world reputation. They feel that he hasenhanced the status of their country and they are particularly sensitive about that status. They feel, too, that no other leader could have brought South Africainto the war and maintained a war effort of some importance. Compared withojher countries South Africa&apos;s contribution may not have been high, but comparedwith what it would have been had General Smuts not been Prime Minister or with what was expected in the immediate pre-war years, it has been remarkable. an indication of the hold he still has on the country was given by the result of a recentby-election at Port Elizabeth. A strong Independent candidate lost to a weakGovernment candidate almost entirely because one of his supporters made a personal attack on the Prime Minister.4. Most South Africans are, however, concerned about a possible successorto the Field-Marshal. Mr. Ffofmeyr has a first-class brain, is an excellent speaker and essentially a man of principle. Unfortunately he lacks to some extent the human touch and has not kept discipline well during the recent periods of general smuts&apos;s absence from the country. Dr. Colin Steyn, who at one time was mentioned as a possible rival candidate, appears now to have faded into the background. Mr. Sturrock is probably the most able of the remaining Ministers,but he is a specialist on transport matters, and in any case it is difficult for an english-speaking South African to become the leader of a Party opposing the nationalists.5. At the beginning of the war the &quot; Nationalists &quot; could be divided into three classes. It has been aptly said that all three desired a republic but hoped to attain it by different methods. On the one hand there were the extremists Mr. Pirow was the most sensational figure among them who believed in theuse of force in order to overthrow not only the existing Government but also thesystem of parliamentary democracy. At the other end of the scale there wasthe Afrikaner Party of General Hertzog and Mr. Havenga who had been his minister of Finance: Members of this party believed that a republic shouldnot be declared until an appreciable number of English-speaking South Africanswere convinced that it was the right form of Government for the country. Betweenthe two lay the great mass of Nationalists, followers of Dr. Malan. Thesediffered from the Afrikaner Party in that they considered that the only practicablemethod of obtaining a republic was the alteration of the Constitution by a baremajority. The conversion to republican ideas of English-speaking South Africanswould follow and not precede the adoption of a Republic Constitution. If in thedarkest days of the war they at times expressed a belief in totalitarian ideas theyhave now eaten their words and claim to be strong upholders of the parliamentarysystem.6. But now all this is changed. Dr. Malan lost the 1943 election, but hegained one success. He succeeded in eliminating all dissentient groups both ofextremists and moderates. As a result all the members of the opposition benchesnow follow him and describe themselves as belonging to a party of which thename when translated into English is the Re-United National Party.7. The Opposition is active without as well as within Parliament. Outsidethere is both an organisation of persons pledged to violent and direct action and a secret and indirect movement. One is represented by the Ossewa Brandwag,a &quot; shirt &quot; movement of a familiar type. It has lost ground greatly. But itsleaders are still vocal, and van Rensburg (their &quot;Fuhrer&quot;) publicly deploredthe &quot; heroic death of Hitler.&quot; The secret and, to my mind, far more importantmovement is that of the Broederbond. A small society of carefully pickedAfrikaners attempts to place its followers in all positions of importance in theCivil Service, the Armed Forces, and public bodies. It has obtained a strangle-hold both on the Dutch Reformed Church and on the Teaching profession, atleast in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. (Education, other thanuniversity and technical education, is in South Africa a Provincial subject.)8. During the session this year there were many rumours of a &quot; rapproche-ment-&quot; between a group of United Party members the &quot; Young Turks &quot; of theparty and some of the more moderate Nationalists who are undoubtedly dis-satisfieci with Dr. Malan&apos;s leadership. Several names were mentioned as possibleleaders of a &quot;New Centre Party.&quot; But there is little doubt that feeling onthe misnamed &apos;&apos; racial &apos;&apos; issue between the republican parties on the one hand
and both the English- and the Afrikaans-speaking followers of the United party on the other hand is still strong. Its future must be considered against the back-ground of recent economic developments in the country. The rise in the priceof gold- which followed the abandonment of the gold standard started a boomin South Africa. That boom received an added impetus from the war. Theexpenditure by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in this country on provisions for convoys, on the Royal Air Force &quot;Training schemes, on shiprepairs, the receipt of large orders from members of the Eastern Group supply council, the demands made for South African manufactured goods by adjoiningAfrican territories, deprived during war-time of overseas shipments, have allbrought wealth to the Union. It has become a creditor country. It has greatlyincreased the holdings of its own nationals in the gold mining industry. It hasbuilt up a large number of secondary industries. Engineering works based onthe mainly State-owned steel organisation named Iscor, which in turn is basedon the country&apos;s extensive coal and iron ore deposits, are notable examples.At the same time it has become increasingly obvious that the Union is not awealthy agricultural country. The rainfall is low and there are few rivers ofimportance. The ravages of erosion are increasing each year. As a result ofa combination of the increased production of gold arising from the high price, ofthe growth of the new secondary industries arising first from the gold boom and later from war conditions, and finally of the exhaustion of the soil, a great driftto the towns has occurred. A new population of Afrikaans-speaking towndwellers is growing up, particularly on the Witwatersrand.9. It follows that the Afrikaner is entering new fields of activity. Inparticular, Afrikaans-speaking South Africans are being employed in increasing numbers by commercial and industrial firms. The political result is uncertain.On the one hand, I have heard it said that the Afrikaner who enters traderealises that South Africa, dependent as it is on the sale of gold, cannot live in economic isolation, and that the result of this realisation is a move towardsthe United Party. On the other hand, commercial organisations have been setup, financed by Afrikaners and with a strong political bias. Examples are aSavings Bank and a Co-operative Trading Society. Their object is to &quot; capture &quot;trade for Afrikaners and their motive is political.10. Perhaps the future of the relations between the European &quot; races &quot;depends on the answers to four questions. How will the new generation ofAfrikaans-speaking South Africans, born in the towns, vote, especially on theWitwatersrand, the key area in South African politics? Will returnedsoldiers of wihom over 50 per cent, are Afrikaans-speaking become animportant force working towards better relations &quot;? Will the growing serious-ness of the Native problem compel the two sections of the European population to bury the hatchet ? On the other hand, will the attempts of the Broederbond andof its sympathisers to eliminate British influence of all sorts, political,educational, commercial, succeed 111. I have mentioned the disputes between the two sections of theEuropean population first because these disputes are in the forefront in the minds of all South Africans. But the really important problem in the futureis that of relations between Europeans as a whole and Africans. In a letterto your predecessor I suggested that the African population (or the Africanproblem) might be sub-divided into the following four parts : (1) Africans permanently resident in rural areas these areas are quiteinsufficient to support more than a small proportion of the population.(2) Africans now permanently resident with their families in the towns.These now number nearly 1 million and work for all classes ofemployers with the notable exception of the Mines.(3) Africans who work for European farmers, whether on a temporarycontract, after the manner of the British agricultural labourer, or as &quot;labour tenants.&quot; The second class are given a portion of theEuropean farm where they may grow their crops and run theircattle. In return, they work a period for the farmer. Their interestsreceive but little protection and, in my personal view, the largenumber of natives on European farms have up to date been veryneglected.[30537] B 2
(4) Africans whose families live in the rural areas but who at intervalscome to the towns to work for a period. This class includes thevery important one of African mine workers. These are all males,temporarily resident in the mining compounds. They come partly from the- Union, partly from the High Commission Territories,partly from Portuguese East Africa and partly from &quot; Tropicalterritories.&quot;12. The result is a curious economic structure. In it there are many cracks.The gap between the wages of the European journeyman and those of the semi-skilled or unskilled Native labourer is very great. The gap between the cost ofliving of the African male temporarily resident in a town compound and that&quot; ofthe African family permanently resident in a town is also large. In the provisionof secondary and even of university education for Natives great progress hasbeen made in the Union mainly, though not entirely, through missionary effort.On the other hand, there has been no spread on a comparable scale of primaryeducation. Moreover, the ruthless application of the industrial colour bar,whether directly through statute or indirectly through the application of agree-ments receiving statutory sanction, or finally through custom, reduces greatlythe opportunities for employment of the educated African. A result is thedevelopment of a third gap, a gap between a large mass of uneducated andprimitive Africans and a small number of highly educated and politicallyadvanced persons. Another result is the appearance among Africans of a classof educated unemployed. These two last developments appear to me, who came to Africa from Asia, to bear an alarming resemblance to the state of affairs onlytoo well known in India.13. In fact there are increasing indications that the Union Governmentmay expect trouble. During the last year there has been a series of violent riotsin the towns. There has also been one notable and successful instance of organisedpassive resistance more or less on the Indian model. In this case the Nativeinhabitants of Alexandra, one of the Native &quot; dormitory suburbs &quot; of Johannes-burg, successfully boycotted the bus service as a protest against an increase in fares. This movement towards violence, or at least towards &quot; direct action,&quot; isnotable among the young. The centre of African education is in the Ciskei, an area in the eastern portion of the Cape Province. There I discovered last monththat, during the last year at the Native University at Fort Hare and at two ofthe three leading secondary schools, a students&apos; riot had occurred. Among youngeducated Africans there is now a tendency to advocate direct action and to advocate also united action by all non-Europeans against the Government.14. The background of all this is insufficient land for Africans, themigratory labour system, and restrictive legislation.15.   The segregation policy of the Union expresses itself in :-(a) Statutory restriction on the areas where native residence or occupationis permitted both in the country and in the towns;(b) The colour bar in industry; and(c) The enforcement of the Pass Laws in the towns.A burning question in Union politics is the migratory labour system. south africans cannot as yet bring themselves to admit that large numbers of Nativesare and will remain permanent residents in the towns. Thus the town Nativemust carry a multiplicity of documents and is frequently prosecuted in terms ofthe Pass Laws. His trades unions cannot be recognised by Government or lawfullyregistered. Few municipalities are prepared to spend any of their revenue from rates on the location. Most still adhere to the view that the location account shouldbe self-supporting. The result has been described in a book recently published, I&quot; Slum Clearance at the Slum Dweller&apos;s Expense.&quot;16. The great protagonists of the migratory labour system are the membersof the Gold Producers&apos; Committee. They declare that if the gold mines were compelled to provide married quarters for their employees many would go out ofbusiness. Now great as has been the growth in secondary industries it has notdecreased the dependence of the country on gold. On the contrary, this growthhas led to-an increased demand for imports of capital goods and raw materials.The only export by which South Africa can pay for a high volume of imports isgold. Recent fears that the mines would soon be worked out are probably jillusory, and for all these reasons the gold mines remain a very great force in the \country.
17. Among Europeans the number of those who may be classed as holding&quot; liberal &quot; views on the Native question has grown and is growing. These views are often expressed in conversation by urban South Africans. They are thosetaught in the large and important Witwatersrand University, They are held byMr. Hofmeyr. They find expression in many English papers. On the otherhand they have not spread to the majority either of farmers or of TradesUnionists. During this year&apos;s session the Nationalist Party, with on one occasiona single dissentient voice, opposed all bills designed to improve the lot of the africans. The Johannesburg City Council have recently refused to approve theconstruction by skilled Native builders of houses designed for occupation byNatives. The liberalism of the English press is matched by the reactionary alarmof the Nationalist Afrikaans papers, and that of the Witwatersrand Universityby the obscurantism of Stellenbosch, Pretoria and Potchefstroom. Modern whiteSouth Africa has greatly increased and will yet further raise expenditure onNatives education and social insurance are cases in point but it has as yetshown no sign of any intention to alter its policy of segregation. The idea behind the policy is the Afrikaans phrase &quot; the kaffir in his place.&quot;18. During the next few years relations between the United Kingdom andthe Union will probably pass through a critical phase. On the one hand thereis a great fund of good will towards Britain, particularly in the traditionallyBritish areas of Natal and the Eastern Province. Many who have no feelings ofsentiment for the British connection realise the benefits South Africa has gained from it. The Royal Navy has defended South ,African shores, and the British tax payer has assisted South African economy by, for example, the purchase ofthe entire wool clip throughout the war period. But habit is strong. britain has for many years been the object of Nationalist attacks. A vested interest in anti-British slogans has grown up among some Nationalist Members ofParliament and journalists. In their hearts these men know they have nothing to fear from- us and most of them know, too, that the identity of the Afrikanerpeople and its symbol, the Afrikaans language, are, following the campaign ofrecent years for the spread of the use and the growth of the literature of thatlanguage, sure of survival.  But this they will not publicly admit.19. The Nationalist creed is and has been since the days of Paul Krugerone of nostalgic isolation. But the leaders cannot insulate their country fromthe rest of the Avorld. They used to look to Germany. Now they realise both that during the war they have &quot;backed the wrong horse,&quot; and that isolationboth from a defence and from an economic point of view is impossible.20. But in these circumstances the Nationalist of to-day looks to the UnitedStates rather than to us. American influence is growing in many spheres of life.American ideas are welcomed by Nationalists who wish to be rid of the chargeof being isolationists yet continue to hate the British. They appeal, too, ontheir own merits to certain other South Africans, of whom Mr. Hofmeyr is a notable example. The Americans are active in this country. I might quote twoillustrations of the &quot; American infiltration &quot; frequently mentioned here in con-versation. One is the American car, far more suitable for rough South Africanroads than any British model. The other is soil erosion. This is rightly one ofthe most widely discussed topics of the day. The United States, as contrasted with Great Britain, suffers from erosion problems, and a stream of Americanliterature and American experts on the subject has been followed by the additionto the already very large Legation staff of an &quot; Agricultural Attache.&quot;21. I have left the three High Commission Territories till the last. their existence has been described as an &quot;unending lecture on Union native policy.&quot;But they might also provide a model and an incentive for those within the Unionwho disagree with present ideas in that country. They differ greatly from one another.In the Bechuanaland Protectorate the accepted British &quot; Native Authority &quot;policy, the integration of indigenous institutions into the system of government,works well. Tribal sense is strong. Most Chiefs are better educated than themajority of their people. They are influential but checked by the rough demo-democracy of the&apos; tribal meetings where all business is discussed and speech is veryfree.   Our difficulties are physical in a vast and arid area.Until a few years ago the tough and independent highlanders of Basutolandwere left very much, too much in fact, to their own devices. In the Union and in southern Rhodesia the tribal system was deliberately and unwisely broken. InBasutoland it was left too uncontrolled.  The Chiefs freed themselves from control
by the tribal meetings and the Government did not interfere. There were somegood results. The national sense survived; the Chiefs succeeded in enforcingthroughout a considerable part of the lowland areas the soil conservation measuresessential for the country&apos;s survival. But other results were bad. There, were too many courts, both of first instance and of appeal, the Chiefs put the fines into their own pockets. Now, sweeping reforms providing for the establishment ofa Native Treasury, for the payment of fixed salaries to the Chiefs, for a drastic reduction in the number of courts, have been almost unanimously accepted bothby the District Councils recently established and each with an elected majority and by the Basutoland National Council consisting largely but not entirely ofnominees of the Paramount Chief. Our problem will be to make a success ofthe new Treasury, to develop the District Councils and, on the physical side, to repeat in the high mountains, where some of.the most important of South Africa&apos;srivers rise, the conservation measures carried out over between one-third and one-half of that part of the lowland arable land said to require protective measures.Much still needs to be done in the lowlands. But it is in the mountains thaterosion and politics are particularly closely connected, and Smuts has shown a personal interest in the condition of the land round the sources of the OrangeRiver. .22. Swaziland is a thorn in the side of every High Commissioner. Thereare nearly 8,000 European residents, Native reserves interspersed with Europeanfarms, Native &quot;squatters&quot; living without legal right on European farms, alarge and very valuable asbestos mine, a land question with a complicated and,from the Native&apos;s point of view, a rather sordid history, in fact the troublesof a piebald country such as the Union or Southern Rhodesia. Having throughthe folly of an old Paramount Chief lost much of their land, the Swazis aresuspicious of all Europeans. Their suspicions, their lack of any properlyorganised &quot; Native Authority &quot; system, the presence of so many Europeans inso small an area and the connection which existed before the outbreak of the BoerWar between Swaziland and the Transvaal Republic, all distinguish that Terri-tory from the other two. In social services it is very backward. But I need not now trouble you further since I will no doubt have to write much about the com-plicated affairs of this Protectorate. I will make only one final point. Thereis little doubt that at least in Basutoland and the Bechuanaland Protectorate,most Africans are strongly opposed to transfer to the Union. This is well known.But I have further discovered that these strong feelings are shared by manyleading and well-educated Africans in the Union.Yours sincerely,E. BARING.
