(45) 196, para. 7)When we reported35 to the Prime Minister on MIDDLE EAST Policy,we asked that an announcement of policy by His Majesty &apos;sGovernment should be delayed until 31st October when allthe necessary forces would be assembled.So      Subsequent to this report, the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff discussed the possibility of an earlierannouncement with the Secretary of State for the colonies and undertook to find out from General Paget whether in his view, it would be -possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government tomake the -announcement, without undue risk, before his fullreinforcements had arrived and if so, what, in his judgment,would be the earliest possible date.3.   , In his reply General Paget has stated that he would prefer no announcement to be made before the 31st Octoberbut that &quot;if an earlier date is necessary he considers thatit should not be before the 23rd October.     His calculationsas regards the 23rd October are based on the assumption thathe would have two divisions worth of troops equipped and.ssembled by that date.4.      The latest situation as regards the arrival of reinforce-ments in the MIDDLE EAST is as follows -(a) 6 Airborne Division, less one infantry battalion,will have arrived at HAIFA by 20th October.(b) One Brigade Group of 3 Infantry Division will arrive in EGYPT by air by 14th October.(c) 3 Infantry Division, less one brigade group, will, havearrived in EGYPT by the 23rd October.(d) The remaining brigade group of 3 Infantry Divisionwill have arrived by the 28th October.s C.O.S.
