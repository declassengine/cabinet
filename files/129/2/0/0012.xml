SECRET. Copy No.  59CP. (45) 162.10th September, 1945.CABINET.DISPOSAL OF THE ITALIAN COLONIES AND OF THE ITALIANMEDITERRANEAN ISLANDS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.WHEN the paper by the Colonial Secretary and myself (O.R.C. (45) 21) wasconsidered at the Overseas Reconstruction Committee on the 30th August, various points were remitted for further examination. Since that meeting the question has been discussed at the Cabinet as a result of the Prime Ministers paperOP. (45) 144; Field-Marshal Smuts has given us his views; and the WashingtonEmbassy have reported that the United States Government are now disposed toleave Italy with all her colonies under trusteeship.2. As this question will be discussed at the Council of Foreign Ministers,it is necessary to arrive at decisions as to the line I should take.3. The United States Government&apos;s suggestion, perhaps prompted by thedesire to keep Russia out of Africa, that Italy should be left with all her coloniesunder trusteeship seems to be altogether too cynical and would surely scandalisea large section of opinion in this and other countries. It would seriously damage our prestige in the Middle East.4. Russian claims to be awarded the exclusive trusteeship of one of these territories or to share in the trusteeship of any or all of them should be resisted.The security of the route through the Mediterranean and Middle East is vital to the safety of the British Empire. This area is one for which we must, i submit, retain, under the World Organisation, primary responsibility, which weshould firmly refuse to share with the U.S.S.R. Field-Marshal Smuts agrees that it would be very risky and undesirable to place the Soviet Union anywhereand in any way on this route.5. In view of our strategic interest in this area, which remains as vitalwith the advent of air power as it ever was before, we cannot disinterest ourselvesfrom the arrangements made in these ex-Italian territories, and, in order to reacharrangements which we can regard as satisfactory, it may in certain cases benecessary to accept direct responsibility and the consequential financial burden.The Chancellor points out that this may be considerable and in view of the serious financial position&quot; which this country now finds itself in, we should certainlyexplore any way of sharing this burden with others.6. To take the Somalilands : our objects are the welfare of the inhabitantsand the safety of Commonwealth lines of communication. The project for anUnited Somalia is very desirable : it would benefit the inhabitants, it would be administratively convenient and would end the present arbitrary frontiers whichdisregarded racial and economic factors. (I do not, however, recommend theinclusion of French Somaliland, which is not inhabited by Somalis.)It had been suggested that the right trustee from the point of view of bothof our objects would be the United Kingdom in view of our long experience, thefact that one of the components of the proposed United Somalia is British andthe geographical situation of the area at the mouth of the Red Sea and on theIndian Ocean. Rather than put forward our claims at once, we could suggestthat the choice of trustee should be deferred until the time comes to draw upthe trusteeship agreement as provided for in Articles 79 t,o 85 of the charter of the United Nations. However, in discussion we ought, I suggest, to canvass12913   [30494]Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.
the idea of the United States assuming the trusteeship. If they reject this, itwill be by so much less easy for them to reject a British claim. Our ultimatepolicy might be a trusteeship to be exercised by the members of the BritishCommonwealth jointly, but administered by a single one of them, perhaps SouthAfrica or the Government of India. In this way the financial responsibility andthe man-power burden would be spread amongst the interested members of theCommonwealth.7. The United Somalia project requires the cession by Ethiopia of the ogaden. The Emperor will never agree to this unless he receives some return.This could be found by the cession of the major part of Eritrea which has racialand geographical affinities with Ethiopia. This cession would be in full sovereignty but would have certain conditions attached. The remainder, theNorth and Western Lowlands, could, for racial and administrative reasons, bejoined to the Sudan. The strategic arguments for including Keren and the wholeof the escarpment within the Sudan do not seem to me decisive.8. The Chiefs of Staff consider it essential to obtain strategic facilities in cyrenaica, and I submit that we should lay claim to the trusteeship of thisterritory as a &quot; strategic area &quot; under Articles 82 and 83 of the Charter. failure to advance our claims would only leave the field open for other bidders.e.g., U.S.S.R,9. In the case of Tripolitania, the choice of Trustee could again be left over,though I doubt whether in practice any alternative to Italy will be found.10. I recommend that Pantellaria and the Pelagian islands should be leftunder Italian sovereignty but should be permanently demilitarised with rightsof inspection.11. I recommend that the Dodecanese should be ceded to Greece with theexception of Castel Rosso, which should go to Turkey; although the inhabitants of this island, 1,000 in number, are mainly Greeks, its geographical situationwhich is immediately off the Turkish coast seems to me the decisive factor. our principal aim must be to prevent the future of the Dodecanese from embitteringGreco-Turkish relations, and if Turkey obtains this one island she may be reconciled to Greece acquiring the rest.E.
