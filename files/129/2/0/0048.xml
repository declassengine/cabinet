Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 198.27th September, 1945.CABINET.MIGRATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN April last my predecessor raised in W.P. (45) 233 the question of reaching agreement with Australia on two draft agreements relating to migration whichhad been prepared by discussions on the official level for submission to the twoGovernments.These draft agreements deal respectively with -(a) the grant of free passages to Australia to ex-servicemen and women fromthis country and their dependants whose admission to Australia is approved by the Australian authorities;(fe) an agreement to provide for assisted passages to civilian migrants andtheir dependants on the footing that the migrant will pay a fixedsum per head, the balance of the cost of passage being borne equallyby the two Governments.These two draft agreements follow in substance similar migration schemes.(a) with regard to ex-servicemen after the war of 1914-18, and(b) a passage agreement for assisted migrants which was in force up to 1939.There are, however, two outstanding points, one on each draft.On the first draft, my predecessor, with the approval of the War Cabinet,pressed the Australian Government to agree that an ex-serviceman from thiscountry arriving as a migrant in Australia should be given the benefit as regardspreference in employment which has recently been given by statute to Australianex-servicemen in Australia.As regards (b) the War Cabinet approved a proposal by the Treasury thatthe passage contribution to be paid by the assisted migrant should be fixed at 15 per adult (out of a total passage cost estimated at  60 to  70) whereas theAustralian authorities wished the mis;ra.nt&apos;s contribution to be limited to  10per adult.These points were subsequently taken up with the Australian authorities buton both heads they have felt unable to meet the suggestions made from here.As regards (a) however, they have recently sent a telegram (annex below)in which, while making it clear that they feel they must adhere to the principlethat employment preference is limited to Australian ex-service personnel,they are willing to extend, on a general scale, the benefits of the social insurance schemes in Australia to accepted ex-servicemen and women who migrate fromthis country, immediately on arrival in Australia, and also to make availablecertain other benefits which are given to ex-service personnel.Our High Commissioner in Australia who had previously advised in favourof pressing for the grant of employment preference has now recommended that,in the light of this latest offer from the Australian authorities, we should accept their proposal and waive our demand for employment preference. He pointsout that the pi-reference is operative only for seven years.I myself accept this view on the understanding that the position is madequite plain to our ex-servicemen contemplating migration and should be glad to have the Cabinefs authority to conclude an agreement with Australia[30608]
regarding ex-service migrants on this basis. I think that we must recognise thatit would be very difficult for the Australians to give our ex-servicemen an employment preference over their munition workers.As regards assisted migrants, there is much to be said for the view that thecharge to be borne by the migrant should be placed as low as possible so that hemay have his existing resources available for assisting him in the difficulties ofhis first settlement in a new country. The additional sum involved ( 5 a head)would be shared with the Commonwealth Government and the total cannotbe large. We are, however, now informed by our High Commissioner inAustralia that the Commonwealth Government would not propose that the contribution agreed upon should be applied until shipping fares had been reducedto a &quot;figure which would make the Government contribution a reasonable onehaving regard to the total cost. It would seem best, therefore, that as the nextstep there should be discussions with the shipping interests, in which I suggestwe should ask the Australian authorities to take part with the object of reachingsome definite understanding as to future passage rates. In the light of that wecan consider further whether we can accept the Australian proposal to limit theindividual migranfs liability to a maximum of  10.I should perhaps add that I attach some importance to reaching an early agreement with the Australian authorities on this matter. We are being facedwith constant inquiries from service personnel for information as to their prospects of settlement overseas. The other Dominion Governments are reluctant to conclude any arrangement on the subject for the time being and if we canconclude an early agreement with Australia, we shall, I think, have a validanswer to any criticism that we are neglecting interests of the service personnel in this matter.I should therefore be glad to have Cabinet authority (a) to conclude an immediate agreement with Australia on the  lines indicated regarding the free passage scheme for ex-service migrants;(b) to invite Australian participation in joint discussions with the shippinginterests as to the future passage rate for assisted migrants, leavingopen for the present the question whether we can accept theAustralian proposal to limit the migrants&apos; contribution to  10per adult.A.Dominions Office, S.W.1,27th September, 1945.. ANNEX.Telegram of 21st August, 1945, from the Government of the Commonwealth ofAustralia to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.(No. 244.)Commonwealth Government is prepared to extend social service benefitsenumerated under heading (A) to all accepted migrants of British nationality,namely, those who are accepted by Australian authorities as suitable for assistedpassages to Australia or, in the case of ex-service personnel, to free passagesunder the proposed agreements between your Government and our Government: (A)i 1. All health and medical service benefits to be made available to theBritish migrants from the date of their arrival in Australia on thebasis that they will be &quot; ordinarily resident in Australia.&quot;2. All accepted British migrants to be deemed eligible for maternityallowance in respect of children born on board a ship during the voyage to Australia, the view being taken that such migrants intend to settle in Australia.3. The qualification of one year&apos;s residence in Australia immediately preceding the date of application for child endowment to be waived.4. The qualification of one year&apos;s residence in Australia immediately preceding the date of application for unemployment and sicknessbenefits to be waived.
It is also proposed to extend the following additional benefits to accepted&quot;ex-service British personnel who come under free passage scheme.(B) (a) Free transportation from port of disembarkation in Australia to final inland destination.(&amp;) Fares to employment under same conditions as apply to Australiansoldiers.(c) Whilst awaiting placement in employment, sustenance at the normalrates payable for Australian soldiers for a limited period of threemonths.(d) Where such are essential to placement in employment, a free gift of toolsof trade, the value not exceeding  10.(e) A time limitation of twelve months after discharge or after arrival inAustralia, whichever is the later, to be placed on items (b) to (d)inclusive.It would be necessary to introduce amending legislation to give effect tosome of these proposals.As indicated, our telegram No. 149, British migrants would enjoy fulladvantages of Australian employment service, but there are extreme difficulties,in way of making any concession on question of extending employment preferenceprovisions of Re-establishment and Employment Act to British or other ex-service personnel not already covered by those provisions. Matter was discussed by minister for Immigration with Deputy High Commissioner and official secretary in High Commissioner^ Office here. Glad if your Government would withdrawobjection on preference question. Would also appreciate early advice whetheryour Government prepared to adhere to the passage rates, viz.,  10 per adultand  5 per juvenile, referred to in our telegram No. 107. Australian Govern-ment is desirous of settling outstanding points as soon as possible to enableagreements to be concluded and plans proceeded with.
