Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET. Copy No. 65CP. (45) 180.19th September, 1945.CABINET.ARTICLE VII OF THE MUTUAL AID AGREEMENT : commercial policy.Memorandum by the Minister of Food.1. The Ministry of Food is directly concerned in commercial policy. It is their task to provide the people of this, country with food in adequate quantityat a reasonable price. Any international arrangement which restricts the suppliesof food to the United Kingdom consumer or involves him in paying an excessiveprice is one which is not in the national interest.2. This country, even under the stimulus of war conditions, has producedlittle more than 40 per cent, of the food it eats. Before the war only about 25 percent, of our food supplies was produced at home. These estimates are in termsof food values (calories); in terms of money values the proportion produced athome is somewhat higher. &apos; We are now slackening our output of certain bulkfood-stuffs (wheat and potatoes), and at the same time endeavouring to rebuild theproduction of other foods (meat, bacon, eggs). Nevertheless, if our diet is to be improved in quantity and quality it will be necessary for us to import from overseas more food than we are obtaining at present.3. In view of the serious financial position which faces us we can onlypurchase the food we need from overseas if our exports are substantially increased.This will only be possible if international trade is released from the hamperinglimitation of high tariffs, import quotas and other restrictions. Equally it isessential that the prices of imported food-stuffs shall be kept as low as possible if all classes of the community are to be provided with an adequate diet.4. Quite apart, therefore, from the obligations accepted under Article VIIof the Mutual Aid Agreement, the Ministry of Food must, in the interest of theconsumer, support all measures designed to expand international trade. Themost recent United States proposals, set out in paragraph 10 of Sir stafford cripps&apos;s memorandum (CP. (45) 116), are more complicated than the originalsuggestions. It may, however, be that United States constitutional difficultiesmake this method of approach inevitable. But if tariff reductions are to be dealtwith country by country, it will presumably be necessary, seeing that we are sodependent upon the Dominions for a large part of our food supplies, for the same procedure to be applied to Imperial preference. Any reductions in ourpreferences should be related to new tariff arrangements. Imperial preferencecannot be swept away or mercilessly truncated by one sweeping blow unless tariffAvails are attacked in the same manner.5. In any case we must not reject the United States proposals. Let usexamine them in consultation with the United States before we even contemplate the possibility of bilateral barter deals. I appreciate that at first sight there might appear to be considerable advantage to this country directly to exchangemanufactured goods for the food and raw materials we need. But when one looksat the markets which would be available to us it is clear how limited are thepossibilities. Our own Dominions, South America and the United States arethe sources from which we draw most of our foods. -Th&apos;e Dominions are sparsely populated. They are developing their own manufacturing industries. Theycannot provide us with the vast new market we need for our increased exports.[30539]
South America is more hopeful; but it lies under the shadow of the Stars andStripes. The United States itself will not provide us with a market unless thereis a substantial reduction in import duties. This will only occur as part of a multilateral arrangement designed to free world trade generally. It will be inEurope, Asia, South America and, indeed, the United States itself, where wemust find our new customers. They will only be available as they, too, becomeprosperous. Our interest therefore lies in working with the United States fora general reduction of tariffs and the abolition of restrictions on trade. Onlyso&apos; shall we be able to afford to purchase the foods we need.&apos; 6. Any policy for developing international trade on a multilateral basismust be compatible with the creation of a sound home agricultural policy. Corn-petition from cheap imported foods must not be allowed to reduce the standardof life of the rural worker or lead to the exhaustion of our land by denying it thebenefits of skilled (and often expensive)-husbandry. There are various methodsof protecting the home producer. He can be assured a fair return for his salesby increasing the price of competing imported commodities through the operationof import duties, or by artificial shortage induced by import restrictions whichcauses prices to rise. In which case the consumer pays. In the case of food theeffect of a rise in the retail price falls most heavily on the poorest section of thecommunity. This method I do not advocate. Alternatively the home-producedfoods can find their own level in competition with cheap imports from overseas and the return to the home producer be supplemented by a subsidy from theExchequer. In which case the taxpayer pays and the cost is distributed over thewhole community in proportion to the wealth and not the needs of the individual.7.   The second system can be achieved by various methods.(1) The existing war-time arrangements could be continued whereby theMinistry of Food purchases the whole of the home-produced supplyand also the imported supply. Different prices may be paid for each,the home producer receives an adequate&quot; return. Cheap importedproduce is &apos;&apos; averaged &apos;&apos; with expensive home-produced food and (with or without the addition of an Exchequer subsidy), the public is pro-vided with cheap food.(2) The method described at (1) above can be operated by Import Boards orCommodity Purchase Organisations operating indirectly instead ofdirectly under a Government Department.(3) A modified system of import duties on imported supplies can be operatedand the proceeds&apos;of the duties paid to home producers (with or withoutthe addition of an Exchequer subsidy). This means some increase in price to the consumer, but not so great an increase as would be thecase were the import duty to be so high as would guarantee a selling price to the home producer sufficient to give him the return he desires.All these methods, provided that any duty levied under (3) is only a small one.are compatible with the United States proposals. The third method is only possible where imported supplies represent a large proportion of the total quantity jconsumed. Otherwise the import duty on a small imported quantity must bevery high to ensure a reasonable payment per unit on a large home-producedquantity. In.such cases the high import duty would be incompatible with theUnited States objectives.8. The only other method is the limitation of imports so as to induceartificial scarcity, thereby causing a. rise in price to the figure needed by thehome producer. This imposes an unnecessary burden on the consumer, deniesto many the opportunity of obtaining the food so restricted in supply and wouldbe incompatible with the United States proposals.9. Criticism is made in Sir Stafford Cripps&apos;s memorandum (paragraph 13)of the United States proposal that export subsidies should be permitted in thecase of commodities which are declared to be in surplus world supply. Whilethe objective of any commercial or commodity policy should be to direct produc-tion, in the interest of the consumer, from high cost to low cost countries, theremay be cases where export subsidies would be unobjectionable. In most caseslow cost production depends upon low wage rates and there is little differencebetween a policy which provides cheap supplies for export by paying low1 wagesand one which provides cheap supplies by paying a subsidy. In the former case jthe cost is borne by the,wage-earner; in the latter, by the community. It would,therefore, not seem wise to reject the United States suggestion out of hand. j
There may be cases, subject to proper safeguards, which ensure that low costproduction due to natural causes is encouraged, where the United states proposal might be in the general interest and benefit both consumer and producer.The main objection to export subsidies is that they are arbitrary, capable ofalteration or abolition at short notice and therefore disturbing to the steadydevelopment of trade.10. In general, I am strongly in favour of the continuance of discussions with the United States with the object of reaching agreement which shall resultin freer trade on a multilateral basis. It must, however, be recognised thatsuch free trade will not be on the old individual basis. Planned imports toensure our supplies of food obtained in bulk may be necessary; but this can beon such a basis that all suppliers can compete on prices, and quality.11. A policy of restrictions and purely bilateral deals will not in the longrun develop our trade to the extent necessary to provide the imported food we need. Moreover, if we are to raise the level of food consumption in thiscountry indeed, if it is to be prevented from falling still lower, we mustobtain substantial supplies from North America. This will only be possible if the necessary dollars are available and if the United States opens her marketsto the world&apos;s goods. It is therefore essential to work towards a state of affairs in which the United States and other creditor countries are prepared. To createthose international conditions of trade and exchange in which the UnitedKingdom is able to buy food freely and cheaply in the world market and in theestablishment of which the United -States is prepared to grant generous financialassistance.B.
