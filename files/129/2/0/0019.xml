SECRET. Copy No.    69.CP. (46) 169.Xkth September, 1945.CABINET.MATRIMONIAL CAUSES (DIVORCE COMMISSIONERS) BILL.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.1. I am seriously disturbed at the problem which has arisen in regard tothe trial of divorce cases and I feel I ought to bring it to the notice of mycolleagues.2. I append a table* from which it will be seen that before the first world war the number of petitions filed annually was under 1,000. They were disposedof by the President and one other Judge. During the course of that war thenumber of petitions filed continued to rise and by the last year of the war reachednearly 2,400. The peak was reached in the year after the war (1919) when thenumber of petitions reached 5,200. Thereafter for some years the number ofpetitions dropped and by 1922 had fallen to under 2,500.3. It seems probable that we shall have the same experience again that isto say that our peak year will probably be 1946, and thereafter there will be, atleast for some years, a decline. But the figures we have to deal with to-day are far greater than any which would then have been contemplated. From 1923 thefigures of petitions began to rise and it became necessary in order to cope withthe growth in the number of cases to appoint a third Judge in 1926. Two moreJudges were appointed in 1938 and three more in 1944, so that at the present timethe President, assisted by seven puisne Judges, deals with divorce cases. Inaddition to this, divorce cases are now heard by the King&apos;s Bench Judges onassizes and the Divorce Judges themselves have been going on Assizes to the bigger towns. The number of petitions filed continues to rise at an alarming rate.In 1944, some 19,000 were filed, and notwithstanding the number of DivorceJudges and the assistance of the King&apos;s Bench Judges on circuit, the number ofcases left outstanding at the end of 1944 was greater than the number taken over from 1943. In 1945, it looks as though the number of petitions filed will be substantially greater than the number filed in 1944 -but notwithstanding this,the arrears will not, I think, prove greater.4. These figures are surely bad enough, but they do not reveal the whole position because they do not include a large number of Service cases which owingto the following circumstances have not yet been entered. During the war therewas set up a system of Legal Aid for the Forces comprising Legal Aid Sectionsin the various Commands and a &apos;&apos; Services Divorce Department &apos;&apos; of the law society, which, together with the Poor Persons Department of the Law Society,were to carry the cases from the original application to the end of the proceedings in Court. Owing to shortage of man-power at every stage and the mass of cases it has had to deal with, this system has broken down. It should by now have got a very large number of cases ready for trial: in fact it has been unable to doso and the system is choked up with a mass of material relating to cases whichare not sufficiently prepared to enable petitions to be served. The number ofeases that have thus banked up will, I am afraid, be proved to amount to some20,000 to 25,000. As soon as the difficulties of man-power and accommodationhave been surmounted, these cases will be entered for trial.5. I thus find myself in the position of having a judicial system barely ableto cope with the number of petitions now being entered, with an avalanche of cases* Appendix.[30457] BPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1945.
behind, which will shortly descend upon us. At the same time this situation is,I believe, a temporary one, and if the experience of the last war proves anyguide we should be able in two or three years time to cope with all the divorcecases with our existing judge power.6. On this view we are confronted with a temporary problem, but under-lying it there is a permanent problem of no little complexity. The expense of an ordinary undefended divorce case is generally speaking of the order of  75. Thisis a heavy burden for ordinary working-class people, and in the vast majorityof cases the litigants come from this section of the community. There is oftenserious delay before the petition is filed, for which the Courts are of course inno way responsible. Once the petition is filed it takes the solicitors a variabletime, perhaps two months on the average, before they can set the case down forhearing. When the case is set down, there elapses a period of two and a half to four months until the pronouncement of the decree nisi, and to this period theremust be added the period of any intervening vacations. After the decree nisithere elapses a further period of six months before the decree is made absolute,though the Judges have a discretion to reduce this period and for good causefrequently do so. The idea underlying this further period was, I suppose, first to give time for reflection. It does sometimes happen that the spouses adjust their differences and do not seek to have the decree made absolute. Secondly,it was to give the King&apos;s Proctor an opportunity of investigating the case sothat in oases of collusion, &amp;c, he could intervene. In fact, the volume of cases is now so great that it is quite impossible for the King&apos;s Proctor to investigatemore than a very small percentage of the cases.7. Three solutions have been suggested. None of them is, I think, bothcomplete and satisfactory.   They are as follows : (i) We might decide to appoint more Divorce Judges.This would assist in eliminating the delay occasioned after the case is setdown.  It does nothing to reduce the expense.I am reluctant to appoint more permanent Judges to deal with divorce than we have at the present time more especially because I hope and believe for thereasons I have already given that the number of divorce cases entered for trialis likely to fall when we have got over the next year or so. If I am to keep upthe quality of the Bench I am reluctant to increase the quantity, and I thinkit undesirable that I should increase the number of Judges whose duty it is to sitday after day hearing undefended divorce cases with practically no variation.The vast majority of oases are now undefended. The King&apos;s Bench Judges, whotry divorce cases on circuit, dislike the task and complain that it is a burden which hampers the smooth working of the circuit system yet they do at leastget the benefit of variation in their work.(ii) We might confer jurisdiction upon the County Courts to try undefendedcases.The supreme merit of such a course is that it would tend to reduce delay inhearing cases and would almost certainly greatly reduce the cost of procuringa divorce. For example, a considerable part of the expense is due to the fact thatwitnesses have to-day to be brought to London or the nearest assize town, oftenhaving to undertake long journeys and then to be accommodated for the night.Moreover, solicitors have a right of audience before the County Court, whereas in the High Court counsel have to be instructed.There are thus formidable arguments in favour of such a course. On theother hand, I must warn my colleagues that any such solution would give riseto acute differences of opinion and to violent controversy Tor we are dealingwith a topic on which different views are most sincerely held and one on which,therefore, controversy is peculiarly liable to become heated. Opponents of sucha course could fairly pray in aid the recent report of the Matrimonial Causes(Trial in the Provinces) Committee (1943, Cmd. 6480) of which Sir RalphWedgwood was Chairman. The Committee considered the question of conferringjurisdiction on the County Courts and unanimously rejected it (p. 15), holding in effect that the pronouncement of a decree of divorce involved such serious consequences as to the status of the citizen that it was inappropriate, to entrust the jurisdiction to any but &quot; the highest available &quot; Court.The more extreme controversialists would regard the proposal to conferjurisdiction on the County Courts as only the first step on a slippery slope.   The
1 next step, they would say, would be to confer jurisdiction on the magistrates, andI the last step would be the institution of a system under which parties could&quot; goand buy a divorce at the Post Office.It would also be argued that the proposal offends against a fundamentalI principle which at present applies, namely, that every stage of the proceedingI from the petition to the pronouncing of the decree is the responsibility of theI organisation working under the President of the Divorce Division an this wayI   uniformity of practice and procedure is secured.If complete jurisdiction in divorce were to be conferred upon the county courts, it would be argued that this uniformity would be endangered and Ithink this would be the case if the County Courts were to- try cases in which theexercise of discretion was involved or cases based upon desertion or cruelty.The President of the Divorce Division would, I feel sure, be strongly opposedi to the grant of such complete jurisdiction to the County Courts and would feelj   bound to voice his objection in the House of Lords.(iii) We might decide to confer jurisdiction upon Divorce Registrars to hearundefended cases.These Registrars may be Barristers or Solicitors and there is power toI   appoint a person who has been trained as a Clerk in the office.   Twro of theI   existing Registrars are Barristers.   The President of the Division has power toI   appoint new Registrars.   I find that the late Government favoured a solution on these lines (W.M. (45) 29th Conclusions, Minute 8) and Lord Simon had actually prepared a Bill which is annexed to this memorandum.  The Bill conferspower on the President to select Registrars for this purpose with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor.   This proposal has the approval of the President andall the Divorce Judges save one.   The President intends, if this jurisdiction isconferred upon him, to select the Barristers who are now Registrars, and tomake fresh appointments from the Bar.   The selected Registrars would heartheir oases in open Court.   The Bill is purely a temporary Bill, lasting for five years.   There is an express provision that it shall cease to have effect on the31st day of December, 1950.This proposal would excite comparatively little opposition and we shouldhave the advantage of being able to say that we were merely taking over theproposal of the late Government. Lord Simon tells me that he discussed thisproposal with the Archbishop of Canterbury and that as a result of this discussion the Archbishop&apos;s anxiety was largely met.This solution would help to eliminate delay but would do nothing to reduceexpense.8. I assume that the very last thing any of us would wish is that we should become embroiled at the beginning of our term of office in a controversy aboutdivorce, which in no way concerns the distinctive outlook of our party. I there-fore recommend the Cabinet to authorise the introduction of the attached Bill,because I think in this way we shall reduce controversy to the greatest possible extent. Both the President of the Divorce Division and Lord Simon will support this Bill in the House of Lords, and I hope I shall be able to get the assent, albeitthe reluctant assent, of the Archbishop.9. The problem of expense of litigation raises a wider issue than that ofdivorce. A Committee under Lord Rushcliffe reported in May of this year upon this topic (Cmd. 6641), and we shall have to consider in the near future what stepswe are going to take to implement that Report.10. I ask for the approval of the Cabinet to the introduction of the bill attached to this paper.J.House of Lords, S.W. 1,14dh September, 1945.[304571

The figures for the year prior to 1911 are available, if required.Note (2). The figures in columns 2 and 3 relate only to petitions for dissolution of marriage and nullity of marriage. The figures in column 4 relate to all classes of matrimonialsuits conducted on behalf of Poor Persons. Poor Persons&apos; statistics do not differentiate betweenthe different classes of matrimonial suits.Note (3). The figures in column 5 for the number of suits proceeding at the end of eachyear are extremely unreliable; due to the fact that a really accurate check is not kept. Thefigures are shown for what they are worth.Note (4). Prior to 1914 proceedings in forma pan peris were the only method by which poorpersons could obtain relief in matrimonial proceedings. The statistics do not differentiate between proceedings in forma pauperis and other proceedings. In 1914 the first system of poorpersons&apos; proceedings on modern lines was instituted. A reform of the original procedure wasmade in 1919 following the report of Mr. Justice Lawrence&apos;s Committee. The reforms madeare reflected in the figures for 1920 and 1921. The Lawrence Committee reported again inFebruary 1925, and further improvements were made in the system with the results shownin the figures for 1927 and 1928. In 1943 the Services Legal Aid Scheme was started, and theeffect of that scheme is reflected in the figures for 1943 and 1944.Note (5). The K.B.D. judges first took divorce at Assizes on the Autumn Circuit of 1922,but the classes of divorce taken were limited to undefended cases (other than desertion cases)and all classes of poor persons&apos; matrimonial suits.[p.t.o.
Note (6). Divorce cases were first made capable of being filed in District Registries inApril 1926.Note (7). The Judicature Act, 1873, limited the number of judges of the P.D.A. to two,and the number remained at that figure until 1925, when provision was made in the Admini-stration of Justice Act of that year, for an additional judge of the division. The numberremained at three until 1937 when further legislation authorised the appointment of two moredivorce judges (following on the Herbert Act of that year). The number later was increasedto eight by the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act, 1944.Note (8). The Matrimonial Causes Act, 1937 (the Herbert Act) came into force on the1st January, 1938. The additional grounds for divorce (e.g., desertion, insanity, &amp;c.) providedfor by that Act are reflected in the figures for 1938.Note (9). The arrangements for taking all classes of divorce causes at Assizes, and for sending the divorce judges on circuit came into operation during the Summer Assize, 1944.
