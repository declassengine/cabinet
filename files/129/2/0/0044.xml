Printed for the Cabinet. September 1945.SECRET. Copy No. -CP. (45) 194.26th September, 1945.CABINET.ANGLO-AMERICAN OIL AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Minister oe Fuel and Power.I wish to report to my colleagues the result of the discussions between theBritish and American Delegations on the revised Oil Agreement which have nowbeen concluded. The new Agreement was signed with the approval of the PrimeMinister on Monday, 24th September. A copy of the Agreement is annexed(Appendix I).2. Prior to submission of the Agreement to the Prime Minister it had beenconsidered by the Ministerial Oil Committee, who had expressed their concurrence.The Chancellor of the Exchequer had requested that the position in regard toforeign exchange should be clarified so as to avoid misunderstanding if the UnitedKingdom Government decided that it had to exercise the right given to them under Article VII (b) of the Agreement to limit imports of dollar oil. Thisprovision is in a more definite and favourable form from our point of view than was the case with the Agreement signed in Washington. The Delegations haveexchanged views on this point which are recorded in the Minutes of the SecondPlenary Session, an extract from which is attached (Appendix II). Mr. Ickeshas indicated in a letter to me that if it is necessary to refer to these Minutes ina debate in Parliament he has no objection. These arrangements are satisfactory to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.3. The new document differs somewhat in phraseology from the previousAgreement. In one or two respects there are changes of some substance, whichare referred to below.4. One important point concerns the United States proposal for allowingother interested countries to adhere at once to the Agreement. There were alsoprovisions in the American draft for calling an international conference forforming a multilateral agreement. Such arrangements appeared to the british delegation to be likely to give rise to confusion and to hamper the carrying outof the plans which would be necessary for putting the Agreement under dis-cussion into operation. The American Delegation have agreed to revert to theform of the Washington Agreement.5. There has been a redefinition of the functions of the International Petro-petroleum  Commission to make this body more of a fact-finding and advisory Corn-mission. It lias been made clear during the discussions, however, that theCommission will be enabled to cover in their studies the whole of the worldindustry.6. The Washington Agreement failed to secure ratification in the SenateForeign Relations Committee, mainly owing to objections raised by the domesticoil industry. This factor has to be borne in mind in considering the new Agree-ment. But it is believed that, as the advisers to Mr. Ickes who represent the domestic oil industry support the new Agreement, it will be ratified by the UnitedStates Senate.7. There are good reasons for believing that the Agreement between the twocountries, even of the somewhat limited character now envisaged, will be of benefitto this country.E.

APPENDIX I.Agreement on Petroleum between the Government of the United States ofAmerica and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britainand Northern Ireland.Preamble.THE Government of the United States of America and the Government ofthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, whose nationalshold, to a substantial extent jointly, rights to explore and develop petroleumresources in other countries, recognise 1. That ample supplies of petroleum, available in international trade tomeet increasing market demands, are essential for both the security and economic well-being of nations;2. That for the foreseeable future the petroleum resources of the world are adequate to assure the availability of such supplies;3. That the prosperity and security of all nations require the efficient and orderly development of the international petroleum trade;4. That the orderly development of the international petroleum trade can best be promoted by international agreement among all countriesinterested in the petroleum trade, whether as producers or consumers.The two Governments have therefore decided, as a preliminary measure tothe calling of an international conference to consider the negotiation of a multi-lateral petroleum agreement, to conclude the following Agreement: Article I.The signatory Governments agree that the international petroleum trade inall its aspects should be conducted in an orderly manner on a world-wide basis with due regard to the considerations set forth in the Preamble, and within the framework of applicable laws and concession contracts. To this end and subject always to considerations of military security and to the provisions of such arrangements for the preservation of peace and prevention of aggression as maybe in force, the signatory Governments affirm the following general principleswith respect to the international petroleum trade : (a) That adequate supplies of petroleum, which shall in this Agreementmean crude petroleum and its derivatives, should be accessible in inter-national trade to the nationals of all countries on a competitive and non-discriminatory basis;(&amp;) That, in making supplies of petroleum thus accessible in international trade, the interests of producing countries should be safeguarded witha view to their economic advancement.Article II.In furtherance of the purposes of this Agreement, the signatory governments will so direct their efforts (a) That all valid concession contracts and lawfully acquired rights shall be respected, and that there shall be no interference directly or indirectlywith such contracts or rights;(5) That with regard to the acquisition of exploration and development rights the principle of equal opportunity shall be respected;(c) That the exploration for and development of petroleum resources, theconstruction and operation of refineries and other facilities, and thedistribution of petroleum, shall not be hampered by restrictions incon-sistent with the purposes of this Agreement.Article III.1. With a view to the wider adoption of the principles embodied in thisAgreement, the signatory Governments agree that as soon as practicable they will propose to the Governments of all interested producing and consuming countries the negotiation of an International Petroleum Agreement, which inter aliawould establish a permanent International Petroleum Council.
2. To this end the signatory Governments agree to formulate at an earlydate plans for an international conference to negotiate such a multilateralpetroleum agreement. They Avill consult together and with other interested governments with a view to taking whatever action is necessary to prepare forthe proposed conference.Article IV.1. Numerous problems of joint immediate interest to the signatory Govern-ments with respect to the international petroleum trade should be discussed, andresolved on a co-operative interim basis if the general petroleum supply situationis not to deteriorate.2. With this end in view, the signatory Governments agree to establish anInternational Petroleum Commission to be composed of six members, three members to be appointed immediately by each Government. To enable theCommission to maintain close contact with the operations of the petroleumindustry, the signatory Governments will facilitate full and adequate consultationwith their nationals engaged in the petroleum industry.3. In furtherance of and in accordance with the purposes of this Agreement,the Commission shall consider problems of mutual interest to the signatory governments and their nationals, and with a view to the equitable disposition ofsuch problems it shall be charged with the following duties and responsibilities : (a) To study the problems of the international petroleum trade caused bydislocations resulting from war;(b) To study past and current trends in the international petroleum trade;(c) To study the effects of changing technology upon the internationalpetroleum trade;(d) To prepare periodic estimates of world demands for petroleum and ofthe supplies available for meeting the demands, and to report as tomeans by which such demands and supplies may be correlated soas to further the efficient and orderly conduct of the internationalpetroleum trade;(e) To make such additional reports as may be appropriate for achieving the purposes of this Agreement and for the broader general under-standing of the problems of the international petroleum trade.4. The Commission shall have power to regulate its procedure and shallestablish such organisation as may be necessary to carry out Its functions underthis Agreement. The expenses of the Commission shall be shared equally by the signatory Governments.Article V.The signatory Governments agree (a) That they will seek to obtain the collaboration of the Governments ofother producing and consuming countries for the realisation of thepurposes of this Agreement, and to consult with such governments in connection with activities of the Commission;(&amp;) That they will assist in making available to the Commission such information as may be required for the discharge of its functions.Article VI.The signatory Governments agree (a) That the reports of the Commission shall be published unless in anyparticular case either Government decides otherwise;(&amp;) That no provision in this Agreement shall be construed to require either government to act upon any report or proposal made by theCommission, or to require the nationals of either Government tocomply with any report or proposal made by the Commission,whether or not the report or proposal is approved by thatGovernment.Article VII.The signatory Governments agree (a) That the general purpose of this Agreement is to facilitate the orderlydevelopment of the international petroleum trade, and that no provision in this Agreement, with the exception of Article II, is tobe construed as applying to the operation of the domestic petroleumindustry within the country of either Government;

ICKES.Por the Government of the United Kingdom of GreatBritain and Northern Ireland :(Signed) EMANUEL SHINWELL.APPENDIX II.Anglo-American Conversations on Petroleum.Extracts from Minutes of Plenary Session No. 2.* * * * * *5. Regulation of Imports.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that in view of their exchange position,the British Government must be free to arrange imports of oil (in the same way as other commodities) so as to take account of the need to reduce expenditureof United States dollars. They recognised that it would be inconsistent with thepurposes of the Agreement for them to restrict imports of dollar oil for this reasonto an extent greater than they judged to be necessary in order to safeguard theirexchange resources; but, subject to that, they regarded themselves as free toarrange imports of oil and to restrict the import of oil involving dollar expenditure to the same extent as they were free to arrange imports of other commodities involving dollar expenditure.Secretary Ickes noted this statement and said he agreed that under theterminology of the Agreement, and in the light of the Delegations&apos; discussions,the British Government would be quite free to arrange imports as they saw fit.He was bound to say, however, that the United States Government on their side would question the practicability of the course the remarks of the Minister of fuel and Power suggested. They felt certain that any such move would operatedestructively both to British and American interests and they would hope that before any such decision was made, the British Government would consult further with the United States Government and explore the possibility of some alterna-tive solution. It was in just such circumstances that the projected commission would be able to serve a most useful purpose.The Minister of Fuel and Power said he was sure that a satisfactory solutionof the present difficulties of the British Government in regard to- foreign exchangecould and would be found and, in the meantime, difficulties of this kind inconnection with petroleum supply should be regarded as a practical operatingproblem.* * * * &amp; *
