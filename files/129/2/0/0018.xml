Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 168.lUh September, 1945.CABINET.THE FUTURE OF BRITISH PUBLICITY TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE course of action which I advocate is as follows :  (a) A decision in principle that foreign publicity is an instrument of foreignpolicy, and that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs must beresponsible for it.(&amp;) A decision to close down the Ministry of Information on a given date,and to divide its functions between the Departments concerned withthe making of policy. In particular, its- foreign responsibilitiesshould be transferred to the Foreign Office.(c) The transformation of the British Council into a branch of the publicservice, under the control of the Foreign Secretary, and the closer -ordination of its work with that of the Foreign Office.(d) The closer co-ordination under the supervision of the Foreign Secretaryof all forms of national publicity in foreign countries, includingpublicity designed for the promotion of exports.(e) The formation of a Government Information Agency, including theProduction Divisions of the present Ministry of Information andBritish Council, to supply the materials of publicity (films, photo-graphs, pamphlets, posters, &amp;c.) required by all GovernmentDepartments at home and abroad.2. The Machinery of Government Committee (of which the present lord president of the Council was, as Home Secretary, a member) recommended to theWar Cabinet, in its Chairman&apos;s report W.P. (44) 482 of the 31st August, 1944,that the Ministry of Information should be kept in existence until the end ofthe war with Japan, and that thereafter the responsibility for publicity should rest with each Government Department in its own sphere. On the 6th June ofthis year the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir J. Anderson, announced in the House of Commons that this was the intention of the late Government.3. Meanwhile, the Departments concerned proceeded, for planning purposes,on the assumption that the Governments decision would follow the recommenda-tions of the Committee.4. The Foreign Office, in consultation with the Ministry of Information,has therefore been preparing itself for the assumption of the Ministry ofInformation^ functions in relation to foreign countries, and for the task ofco-ordinating these functions with the work of the British Council, the foreignservices of the B.B.C., and the work of other official and non-official bodies concerned with national publicity abroad, such as the Department of OverseasTrade, and the Travel Association (or any successor body).5. It is my opinion that the heads of our missions abroad, and indeed thewhole of the Foreign Service, must regard public relations as an essential andintegral part of their duties. Publicity and the giving of information to thepublics of foreign countries is an important part, though not the whole, of public relations, and in my view its objectives in foreign countries must be essentially the same as those of our diplomatic missions and consular posts, in that it will12921    [30519]
strive to make understood what we, as a nation, are doing, and why we act aswe do. It is important, if we are not to speak in foreign countries with twovoices, that the functions of representation and publicity should be more closely related, and this can best be done by integration of the services. It is undesirable,for example, that a Press Attache working at an Embassy abroad should beresponsible to a separate Ministry in London. The Lord President, in paragraph 2of his memorandum M.G. (44) 12 prepared when he was Home Secretary, madea similar point in regard to the undesirability of the division of responsibility between a peace-time Ministry and policy-making Ministers.6. It is, moreover, of the utmost importance that we should make ourrepresentation abroad not only efficient but as economical as possible, for our resources of foreign exchange will be extremely strained for several years tocome. The funds of the British Council (approximately  3,500,000 for 1944-45)are at present provided on the Foreign Office vote, and with the approach ofpeace there has been an increasing overlap of work between the foreign side ofthe Ministry of Information and that of the Council. In my opinion, economycan only be achieved as the result of the closest co-ordination not only betweenthe types of work now done by the Ministry and the Council but also with thosedone by other Government Departments and Government-subsidised agencies,whether they are concerned with promoting our export trade, encouraging the flow of foreign visitors to this country, or explaining our point of view on mattersof world or domestic interest.7. It is mywiew that the administrative economies involved in&apos;the integra-tion of staffs and co-ordination of work which is proposed will result in substantial economies of expenditure, especially in foreign exchange. It should also permit the reduction in the next two years or so of the numbers of staff required for the efficient performance of the Ministry of Information&apos;s present functions to a totalof less than 1,000, against the present total of over 3,000. It will be seen, there-fore, that there are strong administrative arguments to support the changes whichare proposed.8. I wish, therefore, to suggest to my colleagues that the recommendationsof the Machinery of Government Committee of the late Government should, inso far as they relate to foreign publicity, be accepted, and that a date should nowbe set for the transfer to the Foreign Office of the foreign functions of theMinistry of Information. I suggest the 1st January, 1946, as a convenient date to aim at.9. I realise that a decision on this point may bring in its train the need for early decisions on other proposals made by the Machinery of government committee, including the establishment of a Government Information Agency asa technical production unit to serve all Departments of Government, among them the Foreign Office. I think that we should not hesitate to take those decisions.But it may be convenient to set earlier or later dates for the transfer of other functions of the Ministry of Information to the Departments which are to assumethem. The continued existence of the Production Division of the Ministry, either in its present form or as part of the Government Information Agency, is, however,assumed to be necessary in the scheme of transfer to the Foreign Office whichhas been prepared. In this connexion I am glad to observe, in paragraph 3 ofthe memorandum by the Lord President quoted above, a strong endorsement ofthe view that such a production unit will be required.10. A fact of some importance in the consideration of this question is thatthe Ministry of Information depends for its existence on an Order in council under the Ministers, of the Crown (Emergency Appointments) Act, 1939, whichis due to expire at the end of the &quot; emergency.&quot; If it were to be decided tocontinue the existence of the Ministry, legislation to provide for it would presumably be required.E. B.Foreign Office, 13th September, 1945.
