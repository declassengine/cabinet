MAN-POWER JUNE  1945  TO  30th JUNE,   1946.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for AiR.Releases during the period will be governed by :-(i) The personnel level required at the 30th June, 1946.(ii) The rate of contraction to that level which strategic requirements andadministrative possibilities permit,(iii) The intake of new man-power.2. The purpose of this paper is to show the speed at which releases canbe made from the Royal Air Force if the Chiefs of Staffs recommendations(C.O.S. (45) 565 (O)) as to the squadron strength and disposition of the RoyalAir Force at the 30th June, 1946, are accepted. All Commands, will have com-pleted their contraction of squadrons by the end of 1945 or earlier, exceptA.C.S.E.A. and Transport Command where the contraction will not be finallycomplete until June. The plan provides for a total of 209 R.A.F. squadrons atthe end of December, 200 in March 1946, and 191 at 30th June, 1946, and 38,35 and 31 Dominion and R.I.A.F. squadrons at those dates..3. The personnel strength required at the 30th June, 1946, is approximately652,000. It is estimated that by the end of the year a strength of 864,000 willbe reached, on the assumption that the intake for 1945 will be that already approved, viz. : 45,000 men and 2,500 women. Special considerations affectingthe intake required for the first half of 1946 are dealt with later in this paper.The calculations which follow assume no intake during this period.4. Particular attention has been paid to releasing the maximum numbersby the end of this year, and to bringing forward into the early spring as great a proportion as possible of the releases falling due in the first half of next year.The programme of releases approved by the Cabinet before the end of the war*contained an R.A.F. quotient of 216,500 Class A and 12,500 Class B by the31st December. This represented the greatest acceleration of releases possible,without involving grave risk of administrative breakdown, which would impair the efficiency of the R.A.F. in all theatres. In these new calculations, the same; principle has been adopted of planning to accelerate releases to the limit whichthe administrative machine can tolerate. The limiting administrative factorsare outlined in paragraphs 5 and 6 below. The capacity of the dispersal centresis ample for the increased flow of releases.5.   A very large programme of training and remustering is still necessary) to provide replacements for men released or returning from overseas oh tour-expiry, and courses cannot be further shortened.   Until almost the last momentbefore the end of the German war the R.A.F; was organised, at the expense Ofthe training organisation, to maintain the greatest possible impact on the enemy.* CM. (45) 23rd Conclusions.[30536]
Accordingly, when the German war ended, we had been unable to effect any ofthe measures of retraining required to provide for redeployment and release, andwe are still suffering from this inevitable setback. Unless the programme oftraining and remustering can be completed, it will be impossible to retain a balance in the composition of the force (e.g., in the ratio between officers and menand between various trades).6. The disbandment of squadrons and units imposes a special burden uponthe clerical, accounting and equipment trades, in which there are already criticaldeficiencies, and upon Maintenance Command which is responsible for re-issuingand disposing of aircraft, M.T. and general equipment thrown up by disbandingunits. Unless a reasonable minimum period of time is allowed for the contractionof establishments, administrative chaos will ensue.7. The result of any failure to fulfil the training programme and to allow an essential period for the processes of the contraction of-the force would be a progressive deterioration of the fighting power of the R.A.F. in all theatres, andin the efficiency of our world-wide air transport services.8. We are committed to the release of 45,000 women this year, but it would only have been possible to achieve this, had the war continued, at the cost of muchinefficiency and dislocation. I am convinced that it would be wrong now toattempt to accelerate further the release of women at the expense of men.9. In the light of these factors, allowing for increments of personnelbecoming available from redundant aircrews and returning prisoners of war, and assuming the cancellation of our obligation to transfer men to the Navy, the pro-gramme of releases is as follows* : M en.      Women.     Total.Already released, June to 31st August,1945, in Classes A and B ...      ...      38,835      17,892      54,727To be released 1st September to 31stDecember, 1945, in Classes A and B    191,965      27,108    219,073Total by end 1945     ......     228,800      45,000    273,800To be released 1st January to 30th June,1946, in Class A.........     147,700      27,000    174,700Balance to be released during July 1946      17,000       3,000      20,000Grand Total   ...      ........     393,500      75,000    468,500Compared with the previous programme, which provided for the release of216,500 Class A and 12,500 Class B by the end of December 1945 and 90,000Class A by mid-1946; this is an improvement to the extent of 44,800 men andwomen by the 31st December and a further 104,700 by July 1946.Details are given in an Appendix of the monthly incidence of releases and the groups involved.10. It is impossible to make any useful estimate at this stage of the numbersof men who will be influenced by the new conditions to opt for Class B. It hasbeen assumed that Class B exits from the R.A.F. this year will be limited to the12,500 for which replacements are being provided. Any further Class B releaseswill correspondingly reduce the numbers in Class A.Shipping.11. The overall shipping review (D.O. (45) 12) showed that, assuming anumber of important measures are put into effect, it would still be impossibleto meet the combined needs of the Services for shipping from India to the UnitedKingdom in the last quarter of this year, and that the return of 19,700 men would be delayed until January 1946. If this number were divided between thethree Services in proportion to their bids for shipping space, the Royal AirForce share would be about 3,000. The majority of the personnel involved would be due for release, and they would thus be released later than men inthe same age and service groups serving elsewhere, which is undesirable.Nevertheless, this need not involve a change in the planned programme of releases.*Note. Wastage accounts in addition for some 18,000 between September and Decemberthis year and a further 17,000 by mid-1946.
flexibility within the framework of the age and service principle.12. I have carefully considered&apos; whether the application of the age and length of service principle in the R.A.F. is unduly rigid. The principle is being applied separately to each branch, trade or aircrew category, and to rank within these branches, trades and categories. This enables surplus personnel to be released ahead of the average, whilst deficiencies where necessary can be coveredby a measure of retardation; thus, idling is reduced to the smallest proportions.To take an example, a clerk in Group 14 would be released at the same time asan armourer in Group 18. Flexibility is also achieved by spreading over a periodof one month each&apos; series of age and service groups promulgated for release. Asregards arrangements for the release of men from overseas, as far as possiblerelease groups are promulgated in advance, so that men from overseas canusually reach this country not later than the end of the release group period,although there may be some time lag in respect of individuals serving at more distant stations; but,, within the period releases at home are not withheld byreason of any delay in the arrival of personnel of the groups from overseas. Itis considered that any material alteration of this system, for example, theadoption of a policy of promulgating release groups in the knowledge that itwould be generally impossible to bring back&quot; personnel from overseas within or nearly within the release group period, would give rise to serious discontent.Reduction of the overseas tour. .13. Allowance has been made in assessing the man-power requirements for the overseas tour for single men to be reduced from 4 years to 3 years 6 months at the1st December, 1945, while the tour for married men will remain at 3 years. Themean tour of overseas duty for all R.A.F, personnel will therefore approximateto the Army tour of 3 years,4 months in India and the Far East. It is intendedto reduce further the length of overseas tour as soon as the transportation andmanning commitments permit, keeping in line with the Army.Storage and Disposals Policy.14. Out of the total R.A.F. strength required at the 30th June, 1946, some100,000 men will be in Maintenance Command. Apart from the normal functionsof the Command of storage, distribution and repair of equipment in current use,a considerable number of men will be engaged in the removal of stores fromrequisitioned or hired factory premises and in maintaining surplus aircraft andequipment. The establishment of the Command could be reduced if the supply departments could accelerate the disposal of surplus equipment or its transferinto the open on the basis of the guidance given by the Storage Committee.Intake January to June 1946.15. The entry between January and June 1946 will, for the most part be trained, with the exception of aircrews, for effective service in the second halfof 1946. As stated above, no provision has been made in these calculations foran entry of man-power in 1946. In this connection the following questions ariseof the highest importance : (i) &quot;Without a substantial intake the continuance of demobilisation aftermid-1946 would depend entirely upon a further contraction in the size of the Royal Air Force. No forecast is available, however, of the personnel strength required after mid-1946,(ii) On the other hand, it is useless to enter men for training (particularlyaircrews) unless there is an expectation that they will be available fora reasonable period of trained service, and this depends on :-(a) the date of general demobilisation and the date of the terminationof the present emergency;(&amp;) arrangements which might be made in the light of (a) for the entry of men on engagements not related to the duration of theemergency, but for a longer period of service than that expectedto apply under a peace-time system of conscription.At present we are without a basis for personnel planning beyond June 1946and one is urgently required. It is accordingly desirable that early consideration should be given to the questions raised above.A large intake is certainly necessary if we are to insure against having tomaintain a large R.A.F. establishment after June 1946 and having, at the sametime, to continue demobilisation.  Bearing in mind the uncertainties of the
position, I consider that a new intake of at least 50,000 ig probably desirable,If this were forthcoming additional releases^ which might be of the order of30,000; could be made in the first half of 1946.Civilians.16. Civilian industrial establishments will be reduced by some 13,500between June and the end of the year, and a further 1,200 by mid-1946.Doctors and Nurses^17.. The numbers of doctors and nurses released up to the 31st August, 1945.and the estimated numbers which will be available for release subsequent to thatdate are as followsDoctors. Nurses.To 31st August, 1945 ...      ...... 81 72September to December 1945 ...... 439 85Total to 31st December, 1945     ... 520 157January to June 1946 ...      ...      ... 400 nil total to 30th June, 1946 ...... 920 157No allocation of doctors and nurses have been authorised for the second half of1945 and none is assumed. The release of doctors is in the ratio of 2-3 per1,000 of the total reduction in strength of the E.A.F. As regards nurses, there isalready a heavy deficiency and the releases now proposed are confined to marriedmembers of the P.M.E.A.F.N.S. The programme for the release of nurses in thefirst half of 1946 is under examination; so far as can be foreseen at present, very grave difficulties will be found in effecting any releases during this period.S.18th September, 1945.APPENDIX &quot;A.&quot;Monthly Incidence of Releases and Groups Affected.
