B.Foreign Office, S.W.1,3rd January, 1968
ANNEX ACONCORDEMemorandum &quot;by thelMinister of technology the meeting referred to in my minute of11th September to the Prime Minister between the Ministerof State and the French Minister of Transport (M. Chamant)to review the Concorde project took place on 11th December.2.     They had before them the latest report from the concorde Directing Committee  (Appendik A).    This covers thesame ground and follows closely the lines of Annex A tomy paper 0PD(67)79.    There has been no change in the overall appraisal of the project since then.    As shown bythe Minister of State&apos;s report to me  (appendix S) all aspectsof the project were reviewed by him and M. Chamant.Effects of devaluation3.     In prior agreement with the Treasury, we deliberatelyavoided discussing with the French the consequences of devaluation because we want more time to consider theseourselves.     As regards its effects on the applicationof the equal-sharing principle, our tentative view isthat any change in the existing arrangements wouldprobably be to the UK&apos;s disadvantage.     Devaluation will result in a slight increase in development costs on the uk side on account of materials and equipment imported from third countries (mainly the USA);    this should notexceed  315.     But it should increase the competitivenessof Concorde in world markets, since the UK element init should be cheaper in terms of other currencies.Development Costs4.      The outcome of our re-examination of the development costs may be summarised as follows;
(a) If the existing development programme andtimetable are maintained and things goreasonably well, the extramural development costs might be in the region of  550M.This is the lowest cost that can reasonably be expected.(b) If it proves impracticable to maintain theexisting programme unchanged because, forexample, of problems at present unforeseenarising out of the flight programme orchanges in airworthiness requirements, theextramural development costs might rise to 650/700M.    If more money than this had tobe spent to complete development, it would imply that the viability of the project wasin jeopardy either because such fundamental changes to the aircraft had been foundnecessary as would cast doubt on the basicconcept, or because the timescale hadslipped to such an extent that its ability to compete with the American SST would be lost, or both.(c) For the reason given in the Minister ofState&apos;s report it is importaSt&apos;that no publicity should be given for the time-&apos;,being to any higher figure than  500M.for the extramural development co-sts. -(d) On the basis of the present programme(assumption (a) above) the U.K. intramuralcosts are estimated at about  31 millions.Intramural expenditure in Prance is on asimilar scale.    Intramural costs dependin large measure on the success of theextramural programme.    The best estimateof U.K. intramural costs likely to be involved in the case of assumption (b)is about  35 million.Technical Appraisal5.      Inevitably success is uncertain, but, as of today,there is no ground for altering the conclusion reached in OPD(67)79 that despite the continuing problems anduncertainties there is no technical justification forstopping the project.Position of the JTrench government.      I agree with the Minister of State&apos;s conclusion inhis report that the Prench will give us no foothold at thisstage for considering jointly the possibility of stopping the project.    Any suggestion of this kind from us would-2-SECiRET
&quot;be interpreted as an attempt at unilateral withdrawal.Barring unforeseeable catastrophe this situation is not likely to change before the first half of 1969.    Not untilthen shall we have sufficient information to reach a firmconclusion on the overall viability of the project.(Between the beginning of 1968 and the middle of 1969 weshall have had to spend about another  671 on development and another, say,  25M on production).Conclusions7.     In my paper, 0PD(67)79, I reached the following conclusions %(a) The prospects of technical success inevitablyremain uncertain, but are not in themselvessufficient to justify cancellation.(b) The economic prospects considered in relationto balance of payments benefits are alsouncertain, but on certain sets of defensibleassumptions they support a case for continuing.(c) The domestic industrial and unemploymentconsequences of cancellation would be seriousin Bristol, far-reaching for BAC and theaircraft industry in general, and wouldaccelerate the brain drain.(d) The French appear determined to continue with Concorde, and were we to seek to cancel,they would be certain to exploit the issue to our disadvantage.(e) Continued avoidance of further public pledgesof support for the project while refraining from actively working towards its cancellationgives us the worst of both worlds.I believe that these remain valid, and that we have no alternative but to continue with the project, and, subjectto keeping in under continuous close scrutiny, to give it our full support and to discount rumours of itsimpending cancellation.3.     V/e must therefore take all the necessary steps(including legislation) to enable production finance tobe provided as required.    It is likely that about  100Mof working capital will be needed between now and 1972.Up to  25M of this would come from bank loans backed by government guarantee, and the rest from direct loans to the firms.    The Export Credit Guarantee department would participate at the later stage of sales financing.Assistance in providing fixed assets to the value of some 30M will also be recuired.    The detailed arrangements were set out in ST(67)10.-3-SECRET
recommendations.     (i)     Subject to continuous scrutiny the project should proceed with our full support.(2)     Arrangements for financing production should proceed on the lines described above.(3)     Provision for the financing of Concordeproduction should be made in theIndustrial Expansion Bill.Ministry of TechnologyMi lib ank T ow e r, S. 7/. 1.20th December, 1967.-4-
ODO lk ofl+th December, 1967REPORT,.TO BRITISH AND... FRENCH MINISTERS.BxiEilcpNCOMi.DIRECTING, COMMITTEE IPPCj.introduction the CDC believe that the British and French ministers primarily responsible for Concordewi11 find it useful tohave a report from the CDC as a basis for discussion attheir meeting which has been arranged for the time of theroll-out of the first prototype aircraft.     The CDCfurther believe that the most useful form of report is one in which officials describe and express their views on theprincipal problems bearing on the future of the project,rather than a report which catalogues what has alreadybeen achieved.FljjJb^Fli^ght2.     The first flight of Concorde remains planned for the spring cf 1968, but a certain number of difficulties have still to be overcome.     A delay of several weeks, or even of some months, on the planned date of 28th February thusremains possible.Technical problems, bearing: on success3.     Concorde could not be reckoned a success unlessthe aircraft -(a)    secures certificates of airworthiness fromthe Britishauthoritiesthe British, French and American airworthiness(b) is accepted &quot;by civil aviation authoritiesaround the world without operatingrestrictions that would be unacceptable tothe airlines (the areas in which there is some cause for anxiety being noise, sonicbang, and to a lesser extent, runwayloading);(c) offers a performance that most of the majorlong-haul airlines regard as adequate.Unless these aims are achieved, the aircraft will not sellin large numbers, or even at all, no matter at what priceit may be offered or what it would cost to operate.-5-
Aijrworthinessk.     Before an airline can operate any type of aircraft,it must have a 1 type&apos; certificate of airworthiness(C. of A.) issued &quot;by, or acceptable to, the airlines&apos;own government.     For success in a world market, Concordemust meet the requirements of the British, French and american airworthiness authorities.     Americancertification is necessary for 58 of the 7k aircraft forwhich delivery positions have so far been reserved.     all three are working out regulatory codes for SSTs as thedesigns of these aircraft are being evolved.     TheBritish and French are working to a common code;    the americans are evolving their own code, which is notnecessarily more stringent than the British/French code -it is merely different.     It will be more difficult forthe designers (both of Concorde and of its American rival)to meet both codes than it would be to meet either one.Therefore the British/French authorities and the american authorities are keeping in close touch with the aim of achieving as much commonality as possible.     complete failure to achieve certification is thought to be highlyunlikely barring some quite unforeseen technical disaster;the anxiety rather is lest the airworthiness authoritiesqualify their approval by operating restrictions orinsistence on expensive and. time-consuming modifications to the design.     This anxiety is not great with regard toBritish/French certification:    it is slightly greaterwith regard to American certification.     It is not thought likely that the American authorities will bedeliberately obstructive in order to damage the prospects of a rival to their own industry&apos;s product, and providedConcorde is certified for operation by BOAC and Air France,American airlines will be exerting strong pressure onthe types to give it American certification.     The aim isto achieve British, French and American certification by june 1971.     It is thought likely that this can beachieved.Operating restrictions5.     Certification of airworthiness is essentially related to safety.     Civil aircraft also have to meet therequirements of the authorities responsible for theairports from which they are to operate.     There are only two such kinds of requirements that give cause for anxietyin the case of Concorde- they relate to runway loading andengine noise.Runway loading6.     A balance is continually being struck betweendesigning aircraft to suit existing airports, and improving airports to suit new designs of aircraft.When the present generation of American-built
intercontinental jets first appeared on the world&apos;s air-routes, they were barred from certain airports becausethe runways were too short.     Their British rival, theV0.10, was designed specifically to suit these existingshorter runways, and other desirable features weresacrificed in order to achieve this.      In the event,airport authorities lengthened their runways rather thanlose the traffic of the American-built jets, so that theVC.101s advantage became irrelevant, whereas its built-inpenalty continues.     The next generation of American-built aircraft - the Boeing Ikl (jumbo-jet) and Boeing270? (SST) require various airport improvements, some ofwhich have already been put in hand.     But airportsthat are adequate for existing subsonic jets should be quite adequate for Concorde,but for one characteristicfor which Concorde&apos;s requirements   are probably moreexacting than those of the two new American types - thatof runway loading.     One way of expressing this is bythe Load Classification Number (LCN) and is a function ofwheel load., wheel spacing and runway thickness.7.     Concorde&apos;s LCN is likely to be high because the limited volume available in a supersonic aircraftlargely decides its undercarriage design.     This means,for example, that unless the relevant authorities altertheir present regulations or strengthen their runways,Concorde would only be able to operate from certainairports at a reduced take-off weight.     The airports inquestion are about one third of the total on the world.&apos;sLong-haul routes, and generally speaking they are theless important ones.     Such limitations, even if they still apply when Concorde enters service, will not becrucial to its commercial success but, depending on theirseveritys they will cut into the potential market.Engine noise6.     The noise that the engines of jet airliners causecn approaching to land, and immediately before and aftertake-off (that is to say, in the vicinity of airports)is a problem that is causing growing concern in manyc-countries.      (Once modern airliners have achieved theircruising height, the noise from their engines is too faintto cause much annoyance).     Many airport authorities havestringent rules intended to keep this nuisance withinacceptable limits and which oblige airlines to operatetheir aircraft in ways which add to their costs and are otherwise unwelcome to them.9.     The design aim for Concorde has been engine noiselevels that are no worse than those currently accepted atmajor airports for existing subsonic airliners such asthe Boeing 70? and the VC.10.     Until the development programme is further advanced, and in particular untilConcorde prototypes have been flown with engines at fullpower, predictions of noise levels must be based largely on theoretical calculations.     The current assessment isthat the noise on approach to land will be rathe:? better-7-
than that of existing subsonic airliners, that noise aftertake-off will be on balance about the same but that theso-called &apos;lateral1 noise - the noise heard around the runway when the engines are at their full power fortake-off - is likely to be considerably worse.     Enginenoise is difficult to predict, and difficult to express insimple terms even when it can be measured.     The important point to note is that the lateral noise from Concorde islikely to be such as would not at present be accepted bythe airport authorities at London, Paris-Orly or New York.There is nothing to be gained at the moment fromapproaching the New York authorities, but it is important that the British and French airport authorities should consider now how Concorde is to be operated from theirairports.     A great effort is being made to arrive at morereliable estimates of lateral noise, and to devise ways of reducing it with acceptable penalties in terms of time,aircraft performance and cost.     There can be no guarantee that these efforts will be successful, and the problem thusjustifies serious anxiety.10.    The British, French and American governments are working towarcls a policy of requiring all newly designedCivil aircraft to have a noise certification (i.e.something akin to a certificate of airworthiness) without which they would not be allowed to operate.     It isgenerally accepted that noise certification regulations should not be applied retrospectively, and the British/French position is that they should not apply to Concordesince the design of this aircraft is already under way.There are reasons for doubting whether this position willbe wholly acceptable to the Americans (although it isclear that the Boeing 2707 will not meet the revisedregulations) and this provides further grounds for anxietyregarding Concorde&apos;s engine noise.S^ni.c^bopjn. restrict!, one11.     The exact nature of the boom that Concorde wi 11 makewill not be known until the aircraft has flownsupersonically, but this is not a gap in our knowledge that contributes materially to the difficulty in assessingits acceptability.     Whatever the exact nature of the boom,it will be impossible to alter it significantly bymodifying the design.     The boom can be avoided entirelyonly by flying the aircraft at below supersonic speed.Concorde is in fact designed to have a performance (in termsof payload/range) at subsonic speed that is not greatlyinferior to that at its design supersonic speed.     But to fly subsonically is to lose the sole advantage that anSST has over subsonic aircraft, and would only be acceptable to the airlines for relatively short &apos;legs&apos; atthe beginning or end of a supersonic flight.     There are other operating restrictions - for example, on rate ofclimb and on rate of change of direction - that would reduce sonic boom - but these too ?/ould be regarded by the airlines as penalties.     In short, there is no foreseeabletechnical solution to the problem of the sonic boom, andthe most important questions are, what are the nature and
extent of the operating restrictions that governmentsaround the world will eventually apply, and what will hethe effect of these restrictions on the market.Performance12.      Performance&apos; is a word that is capable of almostinfinite extension of meaning in relation to aircraftdesign.     The most important factors, however, are speed and payload/range.13.      Concorde is &quot;being designed for a cruising speed ofover twice the speed of sound (i.e. over Mach 2).     It hasrecently been decided to accept a reduced aim of J/Iach 2.05instead of Mach 2.2 so as to give a greater margin of assurance in achieving other design aims.     This is not likely to have a substantial effect on the attractivenessof Concorde to the airlines, and there is no serious doubt as to the likelihood of its being achieved.lh.     As regards payload/range, Concorde is being designedto carry, on its entry into service in the winter of1971/2, a payload of 20,000 lb. regularly between paris and New York.      (The London/New York requirement is more easily met, the distance being slightly shorter).     Withthe installation of improved engines in 1973? the aim isto raise this payload to 25,000 lb.     The standard versionnow being offered to the airlines provides for seating for132 passengers, in a one class configuration.     As withany aircraft, greater range can be had, within certainlimits, at the cost of reduced payload, and vice versa.Payload/range is also dependent on meteorologicalconditions, and the figures given above are for a certaindegree of regularity of service in certain definedcritical meteorological conditions.     Thus the figuresneed not be regarded as absolute requirements.     At thesame time, there can be no doubt that unless Concorde can carry something closely approaching the design payloadsbetween Paris and New York in the defined conditions,airlines will not find it acceptable for North Atlanticoperations, and this in turn would mean that at best the potential market was drastically reduced, but more probably that it collapsed entirely,15.     The main reason for anxiety about the achievement of the required payload/range - and it is a substantialreason - lies in the growth in the aircraft&apos;s actual and.predicted weight.     With two prototypes almost completewe now are in a very good position to estimate what wouldbe the weight of the slightly larger pre-production and production version, provided they were built to thecurrently-proposed design.     The difficulty that arisesis that of estimating what weight increases are likelyto result from design changes found to be necessary as aresult of -
(a) development flight-testing;(b) modifications that the airlineswill insist upon.Owing to deterioration (corrosion, accumulation of dirt,,etc) the weight of an aircraft increases significantlyin service.     When due allowance has &quot;been made for this,and for (a) and (b) above, the best available evidencesuggests that we are very finely balanced between success and failure in relation to planned performance/range.Which way we are likely to fall should become muchclearer by about the middle of 1969:    by that time weshall know more definitely what modifications the airlines will insist on, and we shall have had a fewmonths of development flying on which to judge the needfor design changes.Ijit^r-reLatippship, of technical, problems16.      It should be appreciated that many of the problemsso far discussed are inter-related.     Other things being equal, additional weight exacerbates the problems ofengine noise, runway loading, and the penalties resultingfrom sonic boom restrictions, and noise reduction mayimply curtailment of payload/range.Progress in defining the technical definition of the product i on jaircraf t17.     Last July, the manufacturers issued to the airlinesa proposed technical specification of the production aircraft to serve as a basis for further discussions thatare now proceeding and that are expected to be substantially completed, in the Spring of 1968.     Thepurpose of these further discussions is to evaluate thevarious modifications proposed by the various airlines inrelation to their effect on payload/range and on development and production costs, so as to enable the manufacturers to arrive at an optimum definition whichwill serve as a basic production standard.     these discussions between airlines and manufacturers are goingwell and are being closely monitored by officials.De^ejjopmenj^j^p.st . estimates18.     The annual revision of the four manufacturers&apos;estimates of -uheir expenditure on development is due bythe end of December.     Preliminary indications are thattheir total will reach the official estimate of  500m.(7,000 MF) (at 1966 prices and the old exchange rate) towhich the Governments are still publicly committed.     There-examination of the estimates being made by officials in Britain and Prance is not yet complete, but it isclear that the  500m. estimate will be substantiallyexceeded.     British and French officials hope to be ableto give Ministers their appraisal of the probable costrange at the meeting on the 11th December.SEORET
Incentive contracts19.     In recent weeks, some progress has &quot;been made, with difficulty, towards agreeing a basis on which negotiationscan proceed with each of the four main contractorstowards the conclusion of incentive contracts for thedevelopment of Concorde.    It must be recognised that the firms maintain their refusal to risk their own money, sothat incentives can only be made to bear on their profits.The aim is to have such contracts signed by 1st April, 1968.However, although officials have been encouraged by recentprogress and believe that the negotiations are well worthpursuing, it is too early yet to be confide?it that their efforts will be crowned with success.Unit production cojsts, and selling-price20. The figures and the opinions thereon which are givenin the following paragraphs are based on the exchange rateof  1 equals 13.8 F.21.     BAC and SUD have recently submitted revised estimates of the average unit production cost of theaircraft and the selling price that would result fromthis after the addition of a Government levy for the recovery of the investment in development.     Details ofthese estimates are as follows: M MFActual cost of manufacture 6.1       8k.kOther costs to be recovered bymanufacturers from receipts from        o       16 0sales (finance charges, profit,etc.)Government levy (at 0.2        3.kTotal selling price 7.5     103.822.     The above figures assume that 100 aircraft are sold,over which the costs can be averaged, and that they areproduced at a rate of three to four aircraft a month.     Ifit were assumed that the programme were continued, and alarge number of aircraft produced and sold over which the costs could be averaged, then the selling price could bereduced slightly.Quantity of aircraft sold100125-150200Average unit selling price M7.57.16.9MF103.898.095.721,120.219.h
23.     Officials have examined the composition of theestimates included in the above figures.     Although theyhave doubts about some of the details, they have atpresent no specific ground for challenging their broadvalidity.     However, in view of the history of under-estimation on this and other aircraft projects in thepast, the CDC can give no guarantee that production costs will not rise above those now quoted by the manufacturers.The current estimates in fact show the following increasecompared with those submitted in 1966 for a productionrun of 100 aircraft.

These calculations raise an interesting question:would the market not stand a higher selling price, andtherefore a higher rate of levy?   Alternatively, will themarket stand levies as high as these?     It is obviousthat the number of Concordes sold will to some extent
depend upon the price at which they are offered.     within limits, the promoters of Concorde(that is to say, the twoGovernments, and the four contractors collectively) are free to decide either the numbers of Concordes they willsell or the price at which they will sell them, although they cannot decide both the numbers sold and the price.In a completely free market, and again within certainlimits, the demand for Concorde from the airlines might bevery elastic in relation to price.     But there is not a completely free market.     The CDC believe that the airlineswill show a strong tendency to adopt a common attitude tothe price they will pay for Concordes.   (The collaboration between the airlines that has been developed to deal withthe problems of defining the basic standard- whilst it hasin other respects been of advantage to the project, shows signs of developing into collaboration in regard to the negotiation of firm orders with BAC and SUD).25.     The CDC believe that the key to substantial sales of concorde lies in the securing of initial firm orders from air France, BOAC and PanAm.     It should be noted that neither the British nor the French national airlines isyet firmly committed to Concorde.    Assuming, however, thatthey do eventually place firm orders for the first six ofthe eight aircraft that have been reserved for each ofthem, the CDC believe that few, if any, further orders canbe expected unless the Air France and BOAC orders arefollowed by a firm order from PanAm.     But once firm orders from these three airlines are secured, it is likely thatthe confidence in the aircraft that these orders willengender and the competitive pressures on the otherairlines to provide a supersonic service, will result in achain reaction of substantial further orders.26.     A list of the delivery positions currently reservedis attached.     It would be wrong to count on all thesebeing converted later into firm orders;    whether or notthis occurs will depend on the considerations described inthe preceding paragraph.     On the other hand, what appearsto be a lull in the negotiation of new options should notbe regarded as proof that no more than about 7k can be sold.     There are two main factors at present inhibitingairlines from negotiating further options.(a) Virtually all the airlines that could makea profitable use of Concorde have already secured options.     It would require the reservation of further positions by ore ofthe leaders (for example, PanAm or TWA) toset off another chain reaction of further orders.(b) The size and shape of the production programme planned is such that deliveriescannot now be offered until late in 197k.By this time the competition of the boeing 2707 (discussed elsewhere in thisreport) is casting its shadow.-13-S EC RET
Amej?ican and^Russian competition27.     The Concorde Economics Prospects Committee, reportingin January 1967, thought it smore likely than not that the americans vail eventually be obliged either to aim at an even later date for the introduction of their aircraft orto aim at lower standards of performance for the aircraftwhen first introduced than those hitherto contemplated&apos;.Subsequent events have borne this out:    the programme hasslipped by at least six months.     First flight is nowplanned for the end of 1970 and first deliveries toairlines at the end of 197U - about 3 years behind Concorde.Many of the difficulties that Concords has encountered andsurmounted are now being met for the first time by itsAmerican rival.     All the evidence suggests that the increases in weight and the reduction in payload/range that have had to be accepted in relation to Concorde will also have to be accepted in due course in relation to the boeing 2707.28.     Nevertheless, the maintenance of several years&apos; leadover the Boeing 2707 remains of crucial importance forConcorde.    There is no reason to believe, at present, thatthis lead cannot be maintained.29.     There are indications that, contrary to earlierrumours, the first flight of the Russian SST (the TupolevIkk) is likely to be some months behind that of Concorde.There is still no reason to consider this aircraft as a significant competitive threat to Concorde.SJLze . and shape of the^ production programme30.     The basis for the production of Concorde aircraft in quantity for sale to the world&apos;s airlines already exists in the capital facilities and experience required for thedevelopment, and it includes tooling sufficient for an output of 3 aircraft a month from the two final assemblylines in Bristol and Toulouse.31.,    The manufacturers have presented to officials a choice of three production programmes based on this capacity.     The following table shows the cumulativedeliveries that would result from each of these threeprogrammes.Programme	1971 :  1972		1973	197U	19751	10	27	58	91	12h2	17	hO	70	105	lil-63	10	31	58	91	130Programme number 1 corresponds to the programme proposedby the firms at the end of 1965;   programme number 2corresponds to proposals by the firms for an acceleratedprogramme;   programme number 3 represents a counter-proposal being studied at the request of officials.-1U-
It is not necessary to decide upon v/hich programme to embark before 1st April, 1968, and having decided to embark on a particular programme, it will be possilbe within limits to alter course as it becomes progressivelyearlier to assess the prospect of the technical, financialand commercial success of the Concorde project.     Officialshope to make positive recommendations to the twoGovernments early in the New Year.     Meanwhile, it maybe noted that none of the proposed programmes offerdelivery of more than about 100 aircraft before the shadowof the Boeing 2707 may be expected (on present plans) to fall across the market.     It is therefore unrealistic toconsider the possibility that numbers greatly in excess of130 (the &apos;central&apos; estimate of sales up to 1975 made bythe CEPC) will be sold unless one is prepared to envisageone or more of the following possibilities beingfulfilled -(a) A substantial increase in the planned rateof production (which implies authorising-additional tooling and capital investment and accepting greater risks in the eventof technical or commercial failure.)(b) A substantial weakening of the competitivethreat posed by the Boeing 2707 (such as/ould result from a lengthening of the3 year gap in availability between Concordeand its rival).Financing production32.     A bill to provide the British Government with powersto finance the production of Concorde will shortly beplaced before Parliament.     Meanwhile the financialsanction required by the British manufacturers to proceedwith production is being provided on an interim basis.On the French side the procedure permitting the firms toproceed with production has been adopted in the course of1967.     This procedure is similar to that put into effect for Caravelle,(signed)Chairman of the CDC and leader of the British DelegationVice-Chairman of the CDC andLeader of the French Delegation

MINIoIBRCONCORD:You will wish to have an immediate report from meon my discussion on 11th December with M. Chamant.     Afull record of the meeting will be available in a fewdays time.2.     Our discussion was a long and frank one.    I madequite clear our disquiet over a number of features of the concorde programme, particularly development costs,payload/range capability, take off lateral noise, sonicbang restrictions and runway loading,       M. Chamantreadily accepted that there were serious problems aheadbut gave no iiidica/tion that they were such as to cause the French Government to waver in its determination tocontinue with the project.   More than once he referredto the way in which many of the daunting problemsalready encountered had been overcome and he was hopeful that the efforts being made to solve the remainingproblems would be equally successful.Development Costs3.      On development costs we outlined the reasoning which led us to believe that the minimum would be  550 million andthat it was only realistic to recognise that circumstances could well arise that might result in the development cost rising to  650/700 million.     M. Chamant&apos;s officialsargued that the only cost estimates which should beconsidered by Ministers were those formally agreed bythe Concorde Directing Committee and that it would be three months before revised estimates from the Committee(which would be based on thorough study of the revised estimates by the firms due at the end of the month)would be available.     M. Chamant did not try to argue that our appraisal was unreasonable but the furthest he would go was to agree that the figure of  500 million was goingto be exceeded and that we must return to the matter a tour next meeting in 3 months&apos; time in the light of thefurther advice from the Concorde Directing Committeebased on the revised estimates from the firm.Payload4.      I referred to the disquieting statements on thepayload/range problem in the Concorde DirectingCommittee&apos;s Report and tried to get M. Chamant to agreethat a payload of less than 20,000 lbs. for the Paris -New York route on hot days would seriously jeopardise the sales prospects of Concorde.   7,&apos;hile he accepted thereport of the C.I/.C. he thought it impracticable at this appendix B
stage to put a precise figure on the minimum payloadwhich would make Concorde saleable.    He argued thatthis was a matter that could only be settled when theactual performance had been established by the flighttest programme and the results discussed with airlinessince the operational economic viability of Concordemust, among other things, be a function of the farestructure that airlines were willing to accept.    Intheir view, firm judgments on these issues could probably not be made before the middle of 1969.     Thisaccords with advice of our own officials.Lateral Noise5.     M. Chamant agreed with me that the lateral noisefrom Concorde at take off was a serious problem, andthat if it led to the Americans forbidding Concordeto operate from New York we should be in serious trouble.He took the view that whilst we could not at present be sure that the New York authorities would not forbidConcorde to use John F. Kennedy airport there was some ground for hoping that this would not happen, sinceConcorde was unlikely to be any worse than the Boeing2707, and the Americans were unlikely to take thepolitical responsibility of imposing conditions on concorde which would prevent its operation but whichwould later have to be relaxed to allow operation ofthe Boeing 2707.   He was unable to give a categoricassurance that they would not place any restrictions onthe operation of Concorde from their own main airports but said that in the case of the new Paris (Nord) airport the noise levels assumed were higher than those for existingjet aircraft and they thought that Concorde noise would fall within these assumed limits.    I said that we hadnot yet made a decision concerning operation from Heathrow.Sonic Bangs6.     On sonic bangs, M. Chamant said that the FrenchGovernment had not yet taken a decision on whether or notsupersonic transport aircraft should be allowed to flyat supersonic speeds over France.    However, from comments on this question made by his officials, it seems unlikelythat they will introduce an absolute ban on such flyingbut they may place restrictions on routes to be used inorder to avoid the larger centres of population.    Theyare against any further series of tests on the OklahomaCity pattern on the grounds that these produceatypical reactions from the public, and consider that inany case there will be little more to be learnt on public reaction until Concorde itself is flying atsupersonic speeds.    I said that we had not yet takenany decision about overland supersonic flights, and we agreed that if possible our two Governments should actjointly in dealing with other countries.
Runway loading7.      I stressed the serious view taken by our colleagues on the runway loading position in view of the effect onthe economic prospects for Concorde if it was not ableto use certain important airports.     M. Chamant thoughtit unlikely that by the time the aircraft came into service it would be a serious problem.    He argued thatairlines who ordered Concorde would almost certainlybring pressure to bear in their countries to ensure thatrunways at the airports Concorde would use would bebrought up to the required standard.    He also pointed outthat certain countries whose airlines had taken or were likely to take options on Concorde, such as Japan, the lebanon and the Argentine, were at present consideringimprovements at their major airports.    It should, ofcourse, be borne in mind that the runway loading ofthe Douglas DC.8/63 series of airliners is as serious as that of Concorde.    Improvements at airports arelikely to be introduced to meet the requirements of theDouglas aircraft with its earlier in-service date (bysome 4 years).Selling.....price and^options8.      I raised with M. Chamant the question of the selling price to be quoted to airlines for production aircraft.He agreed with me that the present option price of$16 million was obviously too low and that while the timing of the revision of this price to airlines whohad already taken options was a matter which wouldrequire careful consideration, the manufacturers must be instructed not to quote a price on new options without consulting our two Governments.    T7e were not able toagree immediately what the new option price should bebut we have instructed the Concorde Directing Committeeto study this matter and the question of revising theprice of present options, to consult with the firms,, andto report back at our next meeting.    We agreed that animportant factor in fixing the final selling price wouldbe the price that Air France and BOAC would be preparedto pay but neither of us a.t present could state what that price would be.       M. Chamant was, however, able to statethat he had an assurance from the Chairman of Air Francethat if the performance and economics of Concorde couldbe shown to be satisfactory to them by the beginning of1969 Air France would then place a firm order, andM. Chamant added that if the performance of the aircraft was satisfactory the French Government would bring great pressure to bear on Air France.
Incentive Contracts.9.     &quot;.re agreed that every effort should be made to achieveincentive contracts by 31st March 1968 and that whilenegotiations were proceeding no publicity should be givento any development cost estimate in excess of  5001.Airworthiness10.   M. Chamant and I took note of the fact that sincethe Concorde Directing Committee *s report was prepared ithad been decided that a high level Anglo-French team of representatives from the airworthiness authorities andthe firms should discuss airworthiness problems directly with the F.A.A.     &apos;..&apos;e agreed that until the outcome ofthese discussions was known there was no further action that we could take.Conclusion11.    The meeting provided the opportunity for a usefulexchange of views.    We agreed that while we could not reach conclusions on the various points raised in thediscussion and in my letter of 6th December to M. Chamant,we must keep them under review between us and we should meet again in three months time.12.    From M. Chamanfs demeanour throughout the meetingI am sure that it would be dangerous to assume anyweakening in the French resolve to carry the Concordeprogramme through to its planned conclusion.       Theywill give us no foothold at this stage for consideringjointly the possibility of stopping the project.     any suggestion of this kind from us would be interpreted as an attempt at unilateral withdrawal and as showing that we lacked faith in the future of European technology and v/ere unreliable partners.JOHN STOREHOUSE13th December, 1967SECRET 20
CONCORDEIntroductionThis paper discusses the feasibility of cancelling Concorde, and thelegal, political, financial and economic implications.    It does net seek to make the case for continuing with the project, which has been set outin AI(67) 6.Tpcjmicj^and Status of^Concjjrde^  &apos;2.     This is summarised at Appendix Ip   Briefly, though there are inevitablytechnical uncertainties and the project is finely balanced between success and failure, there are no overriding technical grounds to justifycancellation now.   The first aircraft is just about to fly and we are unlikely to know for another eighteen months, from progress with flighttrials and from the number of firm orders placed by airlines, whetherthe project is viable or should, on its own merits, be cancelled.3.     By then, the current United Kingdom spend of  100 million will have risen to nearly  200 million.4.     The full development bill for ourselves and France has risen froma first (though incomplete) estimate of  135 million to a currentestimate, in our view, of  550-700 million, depending on the technical difficulties encountered in the rest of the programme.   The French agreethat the currently published figure of  500 million will be exceeded,but do not admit our new estimate; they appear determined to continuethe project.5.     Were it not for the possibility of an award of damages by theInternational Court, cancellation might be expected to save theExchequer between  125 million and  200 million (depending on whetherthe development cost turns out to be  550 million or  700 million),though&apos;   this saving would be reduced by the forfeiture of  30-60 millionpossible revenue from a levy on sales,    we should also avoid the need to lend United Kingdom firms  125 million or so as working capital for production, and should avoid the risk of production lossess several 100 million   higher if disaster overtakes the aircraft when it goesinto service.    In the next two years, calls on the Exchequer would bereduced, as a result of cancellation (leaving damages on one side) bysome  40 million in 1968-69 and  50 million in I969-7O.   Those figures include  30 million by way of loans for production.-21-
-22-6.     Production must begin now, both to meet the needs of the programme and to catch the market.   There is no prospect of selling enough aircraft to enable Governments to recover all their development expenditure.    Ifwe assume sales of 130 aircraft, up to one-third of this expenditure will be recovered, and the implied foreign exchange preference involvedin footing the remainder of the development bill is some 17 to 33 percent, depending on assumptions about selling price etc.    Over  a wider range of possible sales - say 90 or 150 - the implied preference wouldvary between51 per cent and 14 per cent (see table in paragraph 7 of appendix l).Implications of cancellation7,     The remainder of this paper examines the legal implications forcancellation, and the economic, industrial and political- implications,Legal Implications8.      (a)   The legal implications of the cancellation of the concorde project by the United Kingdom (other &quot;these of a political character)are examined in Appendix U(b) The Ag re-inforcement for the development and production of the concorde Aircraft is an international treaty.   Unilateral terminationof the Treaty by the United Kingdom without lawful justification wouldbe a breach of its international obligations.(c) Although circumstances might develop which would justifyunilateral termination, it is not considered that, at the -present time,technical considerations, the escalation in cost or the uncertaintj?&quot; of operational success of the Concorde, would provide Lawful justification.Accordingly, it is unlikely that unilateral termination would be held bythe International Court of Justice to be lawful.(d) The Treaty could, of course, be terminated at any time byagreement between the United Kingdom and France.    But it is difficult to forecast the circumstances that might justify unilateral termination inthe future.(e) If France were to proceed against the United Kingdom before theCourt basing its complaint on unilateral termination, the Court wouldprobably hold the United Kingdom in breach of its international obligations and award damages to France.(f) Any estimate of the amount the Court might order must necessarily be speculative.   Unless the United Kingdom can take steps which would lead the Court to take a more lenient view, damages awarded might beabout  150 million to  200 million.   Therefore, it is possible that the
cost to the United Kingdom of the Court1s award of damages would he no less than the cost of continuing with the Concorde project.   However,the position might be ameliorated if a serious attempt were made to makea settlement with Prance resulting in termination of the Treaty, notunilaterally, but by agreement.   The implications of this course would need further study, but at first sight the prospects of achieving asolution on these lines which would not at the same time erode theeconomic advantages of withdrawal, appear remote; and it would in anycase he essential to avoid a prolonged period of uncertainty during thenegotiations.(g) The case both as to liability and as to damages could besubmitted to the Court by agreement between the United Kingdom andFrance.     There would not seem to be any advantage in agreeing to submit the issue of liability, but there might be some advantage to refer simplythe question of damages either to the Court or to arbitration.   In theabsence of any such agreement, Prance would be able to bring the case before the Court by unilateral application.(h) Any such proceedings would be likely to take two to threeyears,(i) It would be difficult for the United Kingdom to make anyplausible case on the legality of unilateral termination.   Probably thebest type of presentation would be one that picked up all possiblethreads with a view to demonstrating that it had become unreasonable to expect the United Kingdom to continue to fulfil the Treaty.   The most effective considerations would be the doubts as to the success of the project combined with the escalation in cost.   Although this kind of argument is not likely to be effective on the legal merits, the outcome of litigation is always uncertain and it might help en the question of damages.   If the Court were satisfied that the United Kingdom had actedreasonably, there is a fair chance that the Court might be persuaded to award a sum of less than the amount indicated in paragraph (f) above.-23-
Political Implications9,     Outright   cancellation may be expected to bring the followingconsequences -( a )   W orld-wideOur action would devalue international legality, and licenseothers to do the same to us elsewhere.   By abandoning an advanced project of world-wide interest we should strengthen the impression that Britain is on the way eut, both as a power and as a producer and exporter in fields of advanced technology.     Seme sections of international opinion, however,would regard our withdrawal from the project as evidence ofour determination to get Our economic priorities right; and if our action were presented as one of a series of drastic measures designed to restare the health of our economy itwould improve international confidence in sterling,(b)   In^^TjnceThe short-term effect of cancellation cm. Anglo-French relationsseems unlikely to be great:    it could hardly make Frenchpolicies more negative towards us than they already are.French propaganda would however exploit cancellation, makingthe most of the contrast with our attitude at the roll-out;the timing of it, just before the first flight due in March;and its illegality.     Our action wvuld be presented as an example of British perfidy and unreliability; as a spitefulreaction to the veto; and as proof that de G-aulle is rightabout our unfitness for Europe,    Such propaganda would havea significant effect on French public opinion.     In the longer term, cancellation might be a factor in maintaining Frenchhostility to us after de &amp;aulle&apos;s disappearance from the sceneespecially if this happened soon.It is unlikely that military joint projects (Jaguar,helicopters and Ivlartel) w^ulcl be affected, but the Frenchmight well try to exclude us from the European Airbus, towhich no ene is yet committed.    If they abandoned Conecrde.it \would be within their power to do an Airbus either alone or with limited help from Germany and perhaps Italy, usingFrench-built American engines.
(o)   Elsewhe re in europe the following weuld be at risk -(i)    our credibility as a reliable collaborator and treaty-partner;(ii)   the credibility of our concern for European technologicalprogress and of our ability to make a leading contributionto it (if we cancelled Concorde, we should be accused of having widened the &quot;technology gap&quot; and we should beforfeiting to France our claim to leadership in advanced technology),(iii)    the &quot;post-veto exercise&quot; in which we seek to separate the Five from the French and to rally them (from alargely &quot;technological&quot; platform) in support of our continuing candidature,French propaganda will exploit the above among the five as showing how unfit we are for membership; and how rightde G-aulle was,(d)   Our action would naturally be welcomed by the United Statesfrom motives of self-interest.    Some members of the UnitedStates Administration have in the past expressed,doubts about the wisdom af both nur and their going ahead soquickly with supersonic transports,Indj^trial m I^ipll^atiens10.   Unless the French continued alone and used British factories, our withdrawal would involve immediate loss of about 12,000 jobs of which some 10,000 are in the Bristol area and nearly 2,000 at ITeybriclge.    BACwould probably close their Bristol factory.    Some 4-,000 people areemployed on Concorde work elsewhere, but actual loss of jobs would be unlikely to amount to more than a few hundreds in any one place.11.    By 1972, Concorde would account for some 37,000 jobs, or 15-20 percent of prospective employment in the aircraft industry,12.   Without Concorde, and if the French were to cut us out of the airbus (see paragraph 9(b))., the aircraft industry would be without anyadvanced civil project (despite the fact that civil aviation has theprospect of being one of the biggest growth industries of the next decade).   Ministers will recall that a study of the future of theaircraft industry is now in hand.-25-
13.   Rolls Royce would probably be deprived of an outlet for their newadvanced technology engines, and would lose their present world status as suppliers of engines for civil aircraft, which is worth at least 50 million per year in foreign exchange.   These effects might be mitigated by collaboration with American aircraft firms but it is unlikely that we should have more than subcontractor status, with little or no design responsibilxty.   Our chances of undertaking any furtherEuropean collaborative aircraft projects would be greatly reduced.    Itis to such projects that we have been looking, since the Plowden Report,to provide a future for the industry.    The brain drain amongaeronautical specialists, and perhaps more widely, would increase.14.   More broadly, we can look on Concorde either as an over-ambitiousproject which is diverting resources from sounder export-earning orimport-saving ventures and which might \iltimately fail, with far worseconsequences than present cancellation; or we can look on it as one ofthe few areas in which Europe has a clear technological lead overAmerica which we should seek to preserve in view of the increasing importance of civil aviation, and the virtual certainty that there will ultimately be supersonic civil aircraft.15.   If Concorde is dropped, it is highly likely that the americans would slow down their supersonic transport, which is a considerably more ambitious project than Concorde and which promises to strain their resources; it is however unlikely that they will drop their project and leave the field clear to the Russians (whose supersonic transport mayfly later In 1968).General Economic Implications16.   These depend mainly on the outcome of the financial adjustmentsand on the industrial consequences.   As has been seen, these are allimpossible to predict with any certainty.    On the side of disadvantage in cancellation, there must be counted the need to devote resources to payment of damages to Prance, the possible lack of confidence in futurecollaborative technological agreements, and the possible loss of markets for aero engines and other products.    On the side of advantages, the skilled manpower made available would be a great asset in thecircumstances of export-led boom which it is the policy of the G-overnmentto bring about;, and on the face of it, the range of&quot;implied preferences&quot;(see Appendix I, paragraph 7), even taking account of the benefits of-26-SECRET
devaluation are so high that there must he a presumption that analternative use of resources would give better value, and there wouldbe a valuable saving in budgetary terms.   Clearly the balance will tipstrongly, if circumstances arise in the future in which lawfultermination of the Treaty is available to us.Presentation17*   In justifying a decision to cancel we should tell the same story tothe French, to ether governments and in our attributable publicity.   Wecan and should argue that, taking the totality of the continuing costescalation, the technical hazards and the commercial uncertainties, the viability of the project is a matter of judgment.   And our judgmentcannot but be affected by a new factor, namely the overriding importanceof restoring the nation&apos;s economic health:    to achieve this requiresmassive reductions in public expenditure and the release of scarceresources.   We have therefore reached the conclusion that we must abandona long sustained effort to maintain our participation.   France, which was forced to cancel the VG for &quot;budgetary reasons&quot;,,will understand something of the pressures on us.   Our own economic health, which has caused anxiety to France and others, will, we are confident, be improved by our painfuldecision.Tactics ^and Timing18.   While the possibility of cancelling by agreement may be worth exploringand we should be ready to take advantage of it, there is probably no tenablemiddle course between either going on to completion (or untildemonstrable failure) on the one hand, or withdrawing United Kingdomfinancial support on the other.   Half-hearted continuation, or prolongeduncertainty, will save little money and will ensure technical and publicfailure.   Nor would it make economic or technological sense to continuefinancing development, on the grounds that we are legally committed toit, but to leave production to the French.   This would be well-nightentamount to paying a half-share towards a French project.19.   A clear-cut decision is therefore necessary now.   But if thedecision is to cancel Ministers have a choice whether to present it asa fait accompli, or to allow a short period of time after the decisionfor discussions with the French.-27-
20.    The first course would minimise the risk of leaks; in this co.se,the decision would be communicated to the French as near to the time of announcement as is compatible with minimum courtesy - that is, not morethan twenty-four hours before publication here.   We should simultaneouslyinform the Five.21,   The second course would permit us to offer continued physical (butnot financial) co-operation to enable the French to complete the projectif they wished and with a view to strengthening our position before theCourt.   The difficulties of this course are discussed in paragraph 8(f).j^impossible French reaction22.   Technically, the French could complete the Conoox^de provided theygot help from United Kingdom factories and establishments at near thepresent level, and General de Gaulle&apos;s view of it as a prestige projectmight outweigh Finance Ministry objections, particularly in the lightof prospective damage payments by United Kingdom.   Nevertheless, their difficulties would be great, and we can expect the French to try hard tomake us change our minds. p^clu.sions23.   The conclusions appear to be as follows -(a) there are no present legal grounds for withdrawing from Concorde;(b) there are grave legal and political implications in a unilateral abrogation of the Treaty;(c) the financial saving on development might be between 125 million and  200 million, but an award of damages bythe International Court (perhaps between  150 million and 200 million might eventually wipe this out.   In addition, theExchequer would not be called upon to finance production withloans of up to  125 million with the possibility that these might not be recovered;(d) Unilateral cancellation of our Concorde obligations wouldhave serious implications for eur advanced technologicalindustries;(e) If Ministers decide that the general economic case for withdrawalis overriding, there is a choice between presenting the Frenchwith a fait accompli, and consulting them about the method of withdrawl.
CONCORDETechnical status of 0I oncorde1o     The Concorde programme is designed to achieve deliveries forairline service in 1971, some two years later than foreseen at the timeof the 1962 Agreement.   Four development aircraft have teen ordered;the first is due to fly in March 1968.   So far, there are tentativeorders for 74 aircraft; the airlines concerned are expected to signfirm contracts from early 1969 onwards.   To meet these orders andexploit the market fully, production has to overlap development; k- million has already &quot;been committed f**r tools and long-dated materials in the United Kingdom, with similar outlays in France.   While productioncan and will be held back in line with development progress, there isno possibility whatever of avoiding a growing commitment, especiallybecause the first three production aircraft are required for thedevelopment programme.mme.2.     The prospects of technical success inevitably remain uncertain andthe project is at present finely balanced between success and failure;but there is no technical justification for stopping it.   In the absenceof some major technical disaster, we are unlikely to have sufficientinformation to reach a firm conclusion mi the overall viability of the project, and hence to justify cancellation If the facts pointed that way, before about the middle of 1969.   For example, we should by then have a clear definition of the operating economics of the aircraft, anda number of firm orders from airlines.Financial status3.     If the existing development programme and timetable are maintained and things go reasonably well, extramural development costs (i.e, costs in industry) might be in the region of  550- million (as compared with thecurrent published figure of  500 million, - and a figure at the time of theAgreement of  135 million - which did not, however,  cover the Y/hole ofthe programme in present costings).    There are in addition United Kingdomintramural costs (i.e. oosts in Government Establishments) of about 30 million, of which some  20 million have already been spent srpwmmltted;    there are similar oostj in France.-29-
4.     If it proves impracticable to maintain the existing programmeunchanged because, for example, of problems at present unforeseenarising eut of the flight programme, lire believe that the extramuraldevelopment costs might rise to  650-700 million.    The United kingdom share of all these costs is one half, and is not significantlyaffected by devaluation,,5.     These estimates cover the development of Concorde up to its full planned performance in 1973, including the construction of fourdevelopment aircraft.   They also include provision for tooling (tobe used in the construction of the development and production aircraft)on a scale sufficient to build 100 &quot;production&quot; aircraft for sale toairlines, but do not provide for the materials to be used in theconstruction of these &quot;production&quot; aircraft, nor for their actualmanufacture.6.      100 million has so far been spent or committed in the UnitedKingdom ..    Spend is nor/ at the rate of nearly  If million per months   Theadditional spend to the middle of 1969 would be abcurt  70 million endevelopment and  25 million on production.Economic Appraisal7.     Present doubts centre largely on the question whether the Concordein airline operation will heave an economic payload.    The Concorde1 economic Prospects Committee estimated in January 1967, that about130 aircraft would be sold, and enable the two G-governments to recoverup to one-third sf their development expenditure.   The project is thusexpected to be uneconomic in the sense that more will have to be spent in developing and producing it than can be expected to accrue fromsales.   But since the expenditure is almost wholly domestic and receiptswould be either in foreign exchange or could be considered as import saving, some loss might be justified in terms of &quot;implied preference&quot;for foreign exchange.   In the calculation, it is legitimate to disregardpast expenditure as irrelevant to the decision whether we should nowcancel.   The table below gives details on various assumptions as to development cast, aircraft selling price, and sales.    The calculationtakes account of the benefits from devaluation, and of the fact that,without the Concorde, BOAC will have to buy mere Boeing 747s and Boeingsupersonic transport aircraft.-30&quot;

The French agree that the figure of  500 million for development willbe exceeded, but are not prepared to agree a new figure until the ConcordeDirecting Committee has studied revised estimates from the contractors andhas produced a new considered estimate.   This cannot be before late March.9.     The French will give us no foothold at this stage for consideringjointly the stopping of the project.   They appear determined to continue and, If we seek to cancel, will certainly exploit the Issue to nurdisadvantage.Financial consequences of cancellation10,   Unless arrangements were made for United Kingdom firms to continueworking under contract to the French, our withdrawal from the project wouldprobably invelve extra payments to United Kingdom firms of some  50 million over and above  100 million already spent or committed.11.     The savings to be then expected from cancellation are shown in thefollowing table, which is based on total development cost of  550 million.&quot;31-

On this basis, cancellation would save  125 million, or  200 million if atotal development cost of  700 million is assumed - this saving would bereduced by the forfeiture of possible revenue from a levy of between 30 million and  60 million.     V/e should also avoid the need to lend the firms some  125 million as working capital for production (and the risk of several  100 million   investment in production being lost if the projectfailed at a later stage - though this must be regarded as comparativelyunlikely In vie;? of the extensive testing which will take place in thedevelopment programme)*     The total savings in the years 1968-69 and1969-70 would be about  J+0 million and  50 million respectively.12.   Against this, must be set the possible award of damages by theInternational Court.     This might well have to be paid in foreign exchange.-33-
APPENDIX IICONCORDELEGAL ASPECTSLegal Feasibility of CancellationThe Concorde Agreement is an international Treaty providing for collaboration between the United Kingdom and France in the development and production of the Concorde aircraft.   The Treaty contains notermination article.    The exact extent of the commitment is not specifically defined in the main Agreement but it clearly extends to production as well as to development.2.     According to present information, the technical considerations donot justify the conclusion that the Concorde project is, from the technical point of view, impracticable.    If this hypothesis is correct, there is inthis respect no change of circumstances that would provide legaljustification for cancellation.3.     The last estimate of development expenditure approved by the twoGovernments was for a total of  500 million.    French officials haveconceded that the cost is likely to go beyond  500 million, but have not agreed a new figure.   We now believe that the current programme will cost at least  550 million.   Although the increase over the original estimates is high, it has not, in the light of advice previously given bythe Law Officers, reached such a height that the expenditure could beregarded as having been outside that contemplated by the two Governments.Accordingly, it is considered likely that if the escalation of costs weremade the ground for termination, although the point might not be entirelybeyond argument, it would almost certainly fail before the international court of Justice.   The high estimate of  650-700 million (paragraph 4 of appendix i) assumes that problems arise which are currently unforeseeable;it cannot therefore now provide a sure basis for legal argument.4.     The prospects for the operational success or failure of the Concordeare at present uncertain.    Therefore, it cannot be said that the projectis ultimately so certain to fail that the United Kingdom would bejustified in termincating the Treaty on this ground now.-34-
5.     In the light of the above considerations, there is no ground onwhich the Treaty could lawfully be terminated unilaterally by the UnitedKingdom at the present time and it is unlikely that any such unilateraltermination would be held by the International Court of Justice to belawful.6.     The Treaty could be legally terminated by agreement between the twoGovernments.    Such an agreement might be a simple decision to terminateor it might be in the nature of a settlement under which the United kingdom would voluntarily make certain compensation to France.   This might conceivably consist, for example, of an agreement to provide freetechnical information, to make available technicians and possibly to payable contribution towards the cost that would be incurred by France inproceeding alone.7.     It Is, of course, possible that future developments may providevalid grounds for unilateral termination.   This would depend on thecourse of events.    If cancellation in the future is contemplated, timingwould of course be a vital factor.   The time at which unilateraltermination of the Treaty might become lawful would depend not only onthe facts at the time, but also on the extent to which the twoGovernments may have become expressly or by implication committed throughthe work of the Concorde Directing Committee and the approval of thework of that Committee given from time to time by the Ministers of thetwo Governments.International Legal Consequences and the Fossibility of Limiting fosses8.     Since it appears that there is at present no valid ground forunilateral termination of the Treaty, the most likely legal consequenceis that the United Kingdom would lose in any proceedings brought by france complaining of breach or wrongful repudiation of the Treaty.9.     As the Law Officers advised in 1964, it is unlikely that the court would make any order for interim measures designed to preserve theposition of the parties pending judgment, but the possibility cannot be excluded.   The Court would be likely to declare that the Agreement is aTreaty binding on the United Kingdom and that by purported terminationwe were in breach of it.   It is also likely that the Court would awarddamages to France.-35-
10.   Any estimate of the amount the Court might order must necessarily be speculative.   A good deal would depend on the Court&apos;s finding on the exact interpretation of the obligation in the original Treaty and of the commitments that have flowed from it.   The Court might act on theprinciple that a proper measure of compensation would be the additional cost to Prance of completing the project without our assistance.    On theestimate of  550 million, this sum would be likely to be of the order of 175 million (i.e. one half of  550 million less  200 million alreadyspent).   France might be able to prove increases in cost flowing from our withdrawal which might increase this figure to around  200 million.If France decided (as she would be entitled to do) to abandon the project, the award would probably be for the amount of French expenditure and commitment which might be in the order of  150 million plus theCourt&apos;s estimate of the prospective financial loss incurred by France asa result of the termination of the jjroject.    It is impossible to estimatethis figure because it depends on imponderable factors such as prospectivesales of the Concorde Aircraft and the general effect on the economicand technical development of France.    Even though the commercialprospect for Concorde may not be good, it is likely that the Court wouldaward substantial damages under this head.    Taking the broad view, it ispossible that the cost to the United Kingdom of the Court&apos;s award of damages would be no less than the cost of continuing with the concorde project.11.   The amount of damages might conceivably be limited by various steps.Probably the most effective way of cutting the loss would be by asettlement with France on the lines indicated at paragraph 6 above.Short of this, any willingness to co-operate in facilitating the continuation of the project by France alone would be likely to be takeninto consideration by the Court in reduction of the damages.   The more the United Kingdom can appear to be acting reasonably, e.g. bypreliminary discussion of the great difficulties and cost involved, by offering to continue work in British factories under contract to theFrench, by offering technical help and so on, the more are we likelyto be able to persuade the Court to reduce the amount of damages.Steps in the Legal Presentation^of^the^^Case12.    The case might be referred to the International Court of Justice,either by special agreement between the United Kingdom and France or bya French unilateral application.-36-
13.   There would be no apparent advantage in agreeing to refer thequestion of breach to the Court, but there might be some advantage in referring to the Court simply the question of the amount of compensationbecause this might be looked upon by the Court as an element demonstratingthe reasonable behaviour of the United Kingdom.   This is a psychologicalfactor but night in practice bo quite real.   An offer of arbitrationon the quantum of damages would have a similar effect and might becheaper and less troublesome.14.   If however we decided not to agree to submit any issue to inter-national adjudication, the matter might be brought before theInternational Court by France by unilateral application.   There is nothing in the current French and British declarations accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice that could resonably be relied upon to exclude the jurisdiction of the Court.Accordingly, it cannot be conceived that after the application therewould be any preliminary objection involving written pleadings, oralhearing and preliminary judgment before the merits were reached.   there might be some slight delay in the proceedings if France were to apply for interim measures but it is more probable that the case would proceed inthe ordinary way with two sets of written pleadings on either side,followed by an oral hearing and judgment.   The whole process would belikely to take about wo years, but certainly not mere than three years,from the date of the French application.15.   As the question of damages would be both difficult and complicated,it is possible that the Court would postpone its decision on that pointuntil after its original judgment.   This might involve a further delay of a few months.16.   If the Treaty were repudiated by the United Kingdom in presentcircumstances, it would be extremely difficult to make out any plausiblecase on the legality of the termination itself.   The reasons fortermination would be of a general economic and political character.    Itis open to question whether it would be advisable to contest the issuebefore the Court, although it would probably be necessary to make someplea of legality with one eye on the reduction of damages to a minimum.Probably the best type of presentation would be one that picked up allpossible threads with a view to demonstrating that it had becomeunreasonable to expect the United Kingdom to continue to fulfil the-37-
Treaty.    The most effective considerations would be the doubts as to thesuccess of the project combined with the escalation in cost.   We wouldhave to argue that, in the circumstances, the cost had gone beyond what could have been regarded as within the contemplation of the twoGovernments when the Treaty was made (the implication being that theFrench were lucky to escape from the Treaty at this stage).   The argumentwould have no legal merit in Itself but the outcome of litigation is always uncertain and one cannot be absolutely sure that it would be rejected by the Court.17.    On the issue of damages, it might be possible to make a good deal more of this kind of argument and to maintain, on the analogy of privatelaw suits, that once we had made our intentions clear, France was under an obligation, vis-a-vis the United Kingdom, to mitigate her damage.This might involve abandonment of the project by France, and it could be argued, if France chose to continue, that she did so at her own risk.It is difficult to forecast how this line of argument would impress theCourt but there is a fair chance that the Court might be persuaded to award the sum of less than the amount indicated in paragraph 10 above.-38-
/J3NEX CCONCORDEThe accompanying tables show, by comparison with existing plans, theeffects on the Exchequer of:-(i)   Continuing with the project for a further 18 months, on theassumption that we could then withdraw in agreement with France,(ii)   Cancelling now, without offering assistance to France in continuing with the project, and if maximum damages were awardedagainst us by the International Court of Justice.It must be emphasised all the figures are speculative particularly those for receipts and for net outlay if we decide to complete the project.
