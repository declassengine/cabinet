IMMEDIATE U.K. MISSION NEW YORK TO FOREIGN office telegram NUMBER 54 11th January, 1968FROM SECRETARY OF STATE.DEFENCE CUTS,I had a bloody unpleasant meeting in Washington this morningwith Rusk.    His courtesy and moderate Southern manner did notdisguise the depth of feeling and at times even contempt which he expressed.    Bruce and certainly the Malaysians had obviously informed him pretty fully of what is in our mind and he was not altogethersurprised by anything I told him.    Nonetheless he expressed morethan once his &quot;deep distress&quot; at the decisions we had taken.2,       Rusk&apos;s main argument v/as that our decisions wotild have a profound influence on the total world situation.    He was inclined to dismiss as an illusion the idea that our forces in Europe and theUnited Kingdom could have some general capability.    If, pending our entry into the e.c., we were to withdraw into a sort of &quot;little England&quot;,he thought British interests in the Middle East and South East Asiawould suffer progressively.    Rusk was also very concerned about theeffect of our cuts on the American position.     &quot;If you scratch 3,nyAmerican you find an isolationist&quot;.    In the 30&apos;s and 40!s we had set the Americans an example which they had followed to the extent ofsuffering 300, 000 casualties since 1945 in support of peace in various parts of the world.    If the teacher v/as now leaving the pupil americans would be deeplv affected.    They would ask why they should be interestedin the peace of the world if the British were opting out.    He found itembarrassing to say to his British colleaguee quote for GodJs sake beBritain unquote.3.      Rusk had not had time to do his sums, but he was Inclined to argue that the savings we hoped to make would be offset by the damage which we would cause by our withdrawals to British commercial and other interests in South East Asia and the Middle East.    He also tried tosuggest that a withdrawal from the Persian Gulf coming on the heels ofa decision not to supply maritime equipment to South Africa indicated that we had got our priorities wrong.    I took him up sharply on this.I said that this sort of criticism did not come appropriately from aGovernment which for idealogicai reasons had frustrated the efforts ofa British company to sell civil aircraft to South Africa.    Rusk alsoargued that the present was an inopportune moment to withdraw from south East Asia and the Middle East since both areas were in turmoiLI said I did not agree with this assessment.    The situation in the Gulf,for example, was better now than it had been for some time.    The riskof trouble betv/een Iran and Saudi Arabia was less than previously.    Someof the rulers in the Gulf had already been thinking of the sort ofarrangements they would have to make after our departure.-1-
4.      Rusk obviously resented what he called the quote acrid aromaof the fait accompli unquote.    He summed up our discussion byurging us to maintain a tangible presence in South East Asia and theGulf,    He was not making a choice between the two areas.    he believed British interests would be damaged if we withdrew.    He had got the impression from reports reaching him from London that ourinsistence on announcing our withdrawals was a response to politicalpressures; and that we were therefore subordinating the v/orld issues which were paramount at this time to political considerations.5.       I am bringing a full record with me.-2-
IMMEDIATE  CANBERRA TO COMMONWEALTH office telegram No. 78       11th January, 1968SECRETFrom Commonwealth Secretary for Prime Minister.I had discussions with Holyoake, Minister of Defence(Thomson) and senior New Zealand officials today, 11th.     I gave thema full account of our proposals and of my talks in Kuala Lumpur and singapore.2.     Holyoake fs reaction was in general understanding.     There wasa sense of sadness rather than anger at what they clearly regarded asthe ending of an era, he recognised decision was for us and was well aware of economic pressures; but he did not conceal his deep concernand sense of shock at some of the implications of our proposals.3.      Their main anxiety centres round the nature of our generalcapability after our withdrawal and our continuing will and ability to deploy it east of Suez.     They regard this as the test of our intentionto fulfil our frequently re-affirmed moral obligation to come to NewZealand&apos;s assistance as she had come to ours in two world wars.Holyoake said New Zealand could not live through it if Britain wentback on this.     They feel that British willingness to respond demandstroops properly trained and with the right equipment for the area andthe ability to get there in time.     They are therefore anxious to havea clear indication of our future force structures and deployment andan assurance that the general capability will not be tied down by NATOcommitments,4.      I said it would take a little time to work out the details of our general capability.    Although I thought that the question of commitment to NATO was not an insuperable difficulty it was necessary to face uphonestly to the limitations of our lgeneral capability under our new policy.5.      Holyoake attached great importance to the wording of t*urannouncement about our general capability after 1971.     He would bevery concerned if the announcement gave the impression that our generalcapability would be such that our forces could not be deployed east of suez or were to be shaped exclusively to our needs in Europe.     he hoped we would have the possibility of operation east of Suez in the frontrather than in the back of our minds when planning our new forcestructures even though we could not retain a special capacity.    If wesaid or implied that we had washed our hands of the area this would bea very great shock and have serious and continuing reoer cuss ions in new Zealand.    We had publicly admitted that the Far East as.d SouthernAsia was the area where the greatest threat to peace in the next decaaelay.    He hoped therefore that our announcement would make it clearthat the forces we retained after 1971 would be such as could be deployed east of Suez when in our judgment we thought it right.    I saidI would convey this important presentational point to you and mycolleagues.-3-
6.      On the question of a five power conference I explained that theinitiative had come from the Tunku and I had undertaken to discuss it with the other Governments concerned.    I was not authorised to commit myself to any particular conference at any particular time.Our announcement could not be held up to await the conference;  anyconference would have to take place in the framework of the situation created by our decision to withdraw.     We were however anxious to minimise the effects of our withdrawal and to discuss practicalitieswith our Commonwealth partners, including, for example, the extentto which Australia and New Zealand might take over our existing role.7.     Holyoake made it clear there could be no question ofNew Zealand assuming our burdens.     TS\fcy could only stay inMalaysia and Singapore in association with a great power and if that wasnot us it would have to be the United States, who showed no disposition tostep in.    A conference at the appropriate level and after the necessarypreparation would probably be useful? but they must first clear theirlines with Australia.    Their Minister of Defence v/ould be visitingMalaysia and Singapore in about three weeks1 and Has luck a littleearlier.   . After that they would be in a better position to know wherethey stood.8.      The New Zealanders thought the main value of any suchconference would lie in discussing the future of British defence facilities in Malaysia and Singapore.     This was a subject which causedthem considerable concern.    They hoped that in particular it wouldbe possible to arrive at some alternative arrangements for thecontinued maintenance of these facilities after our withdrawal, and thatthey would be available to friendly Commonwealth Governments.    Thiswould ensure a point of re-entry in the event of an emergency.9.      Following additional points came ups-(i)   SEA TO.    I spoke in accordance with the brief.(ii)   Anglo/Malaysian Defence Agreement,    The New Zealandersshowed no especial interest in its survival in a re-interpreted formunless it was backed up by an effective general capability.(iii) Gurkhas.    My advisers explained the present position andthat we must re-examine it in the light of the new decisions.(iv) Commonwealth Brigade.    My advisers explained that the accelerated rundown need not affect the timing for the withdrawal of ourpresent contribution to the Commonwealth Brigade.(v)    The Minister of Defence urged that we should annouce our date of withdrawal as a target rather than as a firm decision.I explained that this would not be possible.10.     At the subsequent Press Conference Holyoake kept to his under-taking to play the matter in a low key.    I assured him that hismoderation would add weight to the expressions of concern which he had made clear to me, in particular in relation to the structure of thegeneral capability and what we sain about it in our announcement.
