THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT3rd January, 1967CABINETPUBLIC expenditure  POST-DEVALUATION measures memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the latest short-term economic forecasts indicate in broadterms that, in order to make a success of devaluation by establishing the balance of payments beyond doubt, v/e should take further action toreduce demand by an annual rate of something of the order of 850 million?  this is needed to prevent a cumulative expansion whichwould soon become insupportable.    The figure of  850 million is interms of factor cost, but in terms of increases in taxes, or reductions in public expenditure, it would be a good deal more, perhaps in the region of  1, 000 million.    The Medium Term Economic Assessment is rather more cautious and puts the required budgetary improvement inthe bracket  500- 1, 000 million.    As time is short, and the risks of failure exceedingly damaging, we need to err on the side of toughness.2.       The measures now taken by the United States to improve theirbalance of payments will make our own task somewhat more difficult -inflow of United States investment may be less, for instance.    Our need to achieve a large current account surplus, involving the release ofhome resources from other activities, is correspondingly increased.3,       The difficulties of finding anything like  1,000 million from taxation are obvious.    V/e must therefore fird substantial sums from public expenditure - the alternative is to let the balance of paymentsslip fatally.    J  we were to let expenditure go ahead unchecked, therewould be no room whatever for any rise in personal consumption;  and since more people would be coming into employment, personal consumption per employed worker would actually have to fall if our balance of payments objective is to be achieved.    This would not, inmy view, be a viable prospect;  consumers, in order to maintain theirliving standards, would frustrate the objective by reducing savings orby pressing for increases in money wages to offset the very stiff rise in taxation which would be re quired.4.       It follows from this that it is essential to get the biggest possiblecontribution towards diminishing demand by reductions in public expenditure.    Obviously, there must be a large cut in defence expenditure.    This can only come from decisions to make drastic changes in defence policy involving major reductions in overseas commitments.    Such decisions would not reduce the rate of defencespending in 1968-69 but they would have a large progressive effect in later years.    I arn having discussions with the Foreign, commonwealth and Defence Secretaries.-1-
5,,       For civil expenditure I propose reductions which would yieldabout  325 million in 1968-69 and about  370 million in 1969-70.    the annex to this paper sets out in more detail the proposals which I have in mind;  I have discussed some of them with some of the spendingMinisters,    The Annex as a whole is concerned primarily with majorblocks of expenditure.    In addition we must follow up the instructionswe have given for making a specially strict scrutiny of the estimates for 1968-69, by extending this approach to smaller items of public expenditure generally, and including 1969-70.    This is dealt with inparagraph 66 of the Annex.6.       Looking at these proposals as a whole, it is obvious that it isessential to get the whole of these reductions;  but, since they are clearly not enough in themselves in the light of the requirement, I am not setting a target for any level of reduction which could be regardedas adequate in itself.    Reductions of the size indicated (together withthe reductions in defence which will not begin to yield anything net until1969-70) would still leave us v/ith an extremely dangerous situation inwhich it would be by no means certain that the remaining part of the requirement could be secured effectively from taxation.7.      Against this background we must therefore not only get allthese reductions but also look further afield, bearing in mind that thebalance of advantage and cost on particular projects and programmes as originally laid out has been radically altered by devaluation.Concorde comes into this category (see paragraph 37 of the Annex),In addition I am exploring with the First Secretary ways and means ofmaking Family Allowances (at present payable for second and subseque:children universally) more selective - see Annex, paragraph 13(c).conclusion.       I ask my colleagues to endorse the general conclusions inparagraph 7.R.H. J.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.3rd January, 1968
f-Tof     secret    DEFENCEIt is necessary to make a substantial further reduction inthe &quot;burden of defence.    There is no effective prospect of achieving this in 1968/69;  and the scope for dramatic reductions in 1969/70 is relatively limited.    This makes it the more important that our decisions on defence, as announced in mid-January should&quot;be &quot;both radical and credible in terms of our present andforeseeable situation.Approach2,     Our standing in the world depends on the soundness of our economy and not on a world wide military presence.    We must getour commitments and resources into a sensible long term balance.I have accordingly proposed to the Foreign, Defence and CommonwealthSecretaries that drastic changes should be made in defence policy,based on the following approach,3.     First, we should decide to cut our commitments outside europe much more rapidly.    Second, and as a consequence of this,we should accelerate sharply the planned reduction in the size of the forces.   Third, we should curtail the equipment purchasingprogrammes.    And fourth, we should aim to secure substantial reductions in the supporting infrastructure, in particular theU.K. base.k-     An approach on these lines, founded on firm decisions to cutour world wide commitments, would be coherent, consistent with thelogic of the July Defence White Paper and convincing evidence ofour determination to come to grips with the realities of our situation.Commitments5.     Against this background, consideration of action on thefollowing lines is inescapable.(a) Acceleration of withdrawal from bases outside Europe,and ending of the associated treaty commitments,so as to complete the process of world wide militarydisengagement by 1970/71, our remaining dependenciesand one or two other small exceptions apart.(b) After our withdrawal from Malaysia and Singapore weshould neither maintain a special capability for use inthe Far East, if required, nor should we base anamphibious force on Australian facilities.(c) We should be prepared to face the possibility that thebill for mitigating aid to Malaysia and Singapore may go up against us 9 and to inform, the two Governments that weshall be ready to discuss this further with them,,(d) We should withdraw at the earliest possible date from thePersian Gulf, say in 1968 or 1969;  and also from Cyprus.(e) We should take such opportunities as may become open tous to withdraw further troops from Europe and disbandthem, in agreement with our allies./Size and Shape of Forces
ItsrSECRE&quot;70Size and Shape, of Forces6.     Decisions along the lines set out above would enable us notonly to withdraw the troops from overseas much more rapidly;but, having withdrawn them, to disband them (or their equivalent).Thus -(a) We should accelerate the reductions in uniformed (75,000)and civilian (80,000) strengths already announced for the mid-70s, so as to achieve the lower levels by 1970-71.(b) We should aim at getting below these levels by thatdate, on the basis that our reduced commitments wouldresult in a smaller strategic reserve.    Its main functionoutside Europe would be to contribute to peace-keeping operations; the major&apos; effort would normally bedirected towards collective peace-keeping, though forces would still be required to come to the assistance of our few remaining dependencies if required.(c) The accelerated rate of rundown ought to begin   early in 1958.Equipment7.     A radical cut in commitments leading to big reductions in the role and size of the forces will also make possible substantial economies in planned equipment programmes.   While all of thesecannot of course be decided and announced by mid-January, someconvincing examples will need to be given.   The followingpossibilities should be considered: there are no doubt others -(a) Navy;    Carrier force and Fleet Air Arm (fixed wing)phased out by 1970/71, purchases of Phantoms reduced,naval construction programme reduced and slowed downand nuclear capability, including Polaris, abandoned.(b) Army: Elimination of specific vehicles, weapons etc.(c) Air forces    Cancellation of the Harrier, decision not toproceed with AFVG successor, cancellation of the F.111purchase, reduction in Phantom purchase, cancellation ofMartel guided missile project.(d) R *&amp;D * i It should be possible to define approximatelywhat further switch of R.&amp;D:. resources from defence to civil purposes is feasible.Infrastructure and U.K. base8.     Decisions on the above lines will have far reaching consequenceson the supporting infrastructure, in particular the UoK. base.   very big savings ought to accrue in the longer-term;  a proportion of these should be realisable by 1970-71.Transitional expenditure.     It will be necessary to consider the likely size of transitionalexpenditure and how to treat it./Pre sent at i on i

ii civil expenditure ^^SML-S^piti11.   The main issues are:-a) When should any class of &quot;benefit go up?b) By how much should they go up when they do?12.    In reaching decisions, we have to remember that(l)   Benefit increases have to be paid for by extra taxationor contributions.    Generally these fall on the working population or industry on both of whom economic recoverydepends.(2)   The living standards of the working population are at best unlikely to rise in the next two years if theessential shift of resources to exports is made.    Betterbenefits for the nun-productive or least productive sectionsof the community will penalise the working population and industry further.(3)   Benefit improvements cost a great deal as thefollowing gr o s s f i figures show % -Is. on National Insurance (N.I.) Benefits -  25m 4- p.a.Is. on Supplementary Benefits (s.3s.) s  8.2m p.a.Is. on Family Allowances (FAM) =  l6m p.a.When Should Benefits go up?15.    (a) Supplementary Benefits.   An increase is likely to be justi-fled in Autumn or early Winter 1968.   We should allow for this with effect from end October - apart from cost an earlier increase would be likely to be forgotten by the time Winter came.   The risein prices by then might justify a hs. to 5s. increase at a cost of up to  hi million per annum,(&apos;b) N^I^^Benefits.   These have just been raised by 10s. on the basic pension.    The next uprating is at present planned for Autumn1969.    In working out my economic strategy I must know for certainwhat is the earliest time at which such huge additional expenditurecan occur.    We should now decide firmly that there will be no up-rating before October 1969 - on present forecasts the rise inprices by then will not be significantly more than was the risebefore the March 1965 uprating.    If price rises are less than expected,it could be right to wait till early December 1969 but probably not later.(c)   FAM.    These are already planned to go up by 7s. for 2ndand subsequent children in April 1968, and. the expected rise inprices in 1968-69 would not justify even Is. more.I am considering with great urgency whether this 7s. increasecan be made selective and any net benefit confined to those with low incomes.    I cannot yet say with certainty that this can be donein 1968-69.    But such is the need to restrain expenditure that,oven if my efforts are successful, I must ask my colleagues not topress for any further FAM increase in 1968-69./By
By how much should Benefits go up?lu,,,   Any rise must he restricted to what is necessary to compensate for the rise in prices only.    There can be no question of improving the real value of any benefits over the next two years at a timewhen the disposable incomes of the working population may well fall.I do not think the working population could he expected to have their standards reduced in order to improve the relative positionof those on benefit.15c   This decision should be announced now.    If It is not, people will expect real increases on the lines of recent upratings and thiswill make our task doubly diffico.lt.    In any case contributors andtaxpayers ought to know that their liability will be limited.    Wecannot as an alternative announce a figure of intended savings.   the starting point for calculating savings is current policy.   For N.I.benefits, current policy is to uprate in October 1969 by an amountequivalent to halfway between the rise in prices and the rise in earnings.    But this decision has never been announced.   Clearly, to announce savings of  Xm without saying what they are a saving onwould be useless; and, if it was explained, the policy underlying the figures would he obvious.16.    It is not possible to sa^ what savings would be achieved by keeping any increase in benefits in line with the rise in pricesbecause we cannot now forecast reliably the relative movements of earnings and prices.    If, however, money earnings were to rise by,say, 3 per cent p.a.-faster than prices between autumn 1967 andautumn 1969, then to keep the 1969 uprating In line with prices would save at least  35 million in 1969-70 and  70 million in thefirst full year (1970-71)* compared with an increase halfway betweenprices and earnings as contemplated by Ministers in the summer.Social Securirity  million1967-661960-691969-703161-35Forecast expenditureIllustrative cut proposed29093196Total after proposed cuts290931063126
b .   foreign -        7(including LOCAL LIBRARIES)17,       About 13 per cent of total public expenditure goes on this,about half on schools.      I cannot do without a large contribution from this field.18*     Postpone the Raising of the School Leaving Age (R.S.L.A.),This is one of the few self-contained and coherent decisions that could bo taken at once to restrain expenditure and reduce publicborrowing and pressure on the construction industry.     I cannotimpress on my colleagues too strongly the overwhelming need totake this unpalatable decision.     It is now taken for granted in nearly all quarters that R.S.L.A. will be deferred,      If we fail to defer now we shall cause a double and very serious loss ofconfidence.     I propose a three year deferment to save e 33 million in 1968-69,  48 million in 1369-70 and  48 million in 1970-71.This would be objected to by few., welcomed by many and it would of course be open to children to stay on voluntarily after age 15.But to ensure that our policies on !&apos;comprehensiveness&quot; and onrelieving squalor can be pressed ahead, I propose that we should give back for these purposes  3 million in 1968-69,  8 million in 1969-70 and  8 million in 1970-71.     This would be an important element in presenting our decision on doferring RfS.L.A.i&apos;9;.     Other Savings.     To defer R.S.L.A. is not enough.     Inaddition I must ask that the following measures should also betaicen:(1)    Withdrawal of free milk in secondary schools (butnot primary schools) from September 1968(2) Some reductions in capital expenditure planned for Further Education, Libraries and the youth service.(3)    Student awards - a oost-of-living increase is due in September 1968 and this should compensate not for 100 per cent of the rise in the cost ofliving but only 50 per cent of it.(4)    It should be agreed and announced now that the prici;of school meals will be raised by a further 6d to2/- in April 1969.     This will give time to reviewarrangements for relief for low income families and ensure that rising costs axe met by betteroff consumers. m,20.

At constant prices, itis at present planned to go up by about Zj. per cent per annum,    but these are labour-intensive services, and their cost in terms of current prices rises fast.

We must get at least  60 million a year from it.22*   Prescription Charges.    It is, I fear, essential that these should be reintroducedo    Our efforts to restore the economy have no chance,, otherwise, of carrying conviction.    I propose that the charge should be 2So 6d, per prescription item.    The charges must be brought back at the earliest possible moment.    It is only by reintroducing thescheme that existed up to 1965 that charges can be started quickly.This would be possible in the spring.23o    Those on Supplementary Benefits (about A million), those withincomes at or below S.B. levels (about 1 .25 million) and war pensioners in respect of their disabilities (about 0.6 million)would be given relief.    Allowing for this, the charges could produceabout  50 million per annum from additional revenue and reduceddemand.    But estimating is very difficult.    I am prepared to consider in due course extending relief from the charges rather more widely;but this is not technically possible in the near future and maynever be so.    I will discuss with the Minister of Health what mightbe said on this score.2k,   local Health and-:J/eljfare.

HOUSING2$.   We are no longer in a position of overall houaing shortage;whereas In 1951   there were 1 \ million more families than houses,by the end of 1966 there were as many dwellings as households.By the early 1970s houses should outnumber households by rather more than 1  million.    Serious housing problems remain, but local shortages are being progressively overtaken and slum clearance hasbeen increased.    This is largely because we have maintained house-building at a record level over the past three years.    Clearly wemust continue to give high priority to eliminating local shortagesand to increasing the rate of slum clearance.   But it seemsimpracticable to make any significant reduction in the payment of housing subsidies over the next two years and we must obtain somesaving on the housing programme.    While therefore I recognise thatpriority areas cannot be insulated from the effects of any substantial reduction in numbers, I propose that approvals in England and wales should be cut by 1 5,000 in 1 968 and 1 5,000 in 1969.    These cutsshould produce savings of  25 million in 1968-69 and ShS million in1969-70 in England and Wales;    Comparable savings should be sought by administrative means in Scotland.27&quot;   Proposals for increased expenditure on repairs and improvementsof existing houses are being considered.    It may well be sensible to adjust the balance within the reduced total I now propose:    but therecan be no question of increasing expenditure for this purpose alone.Housing m.Forecast expenditure12 Z^681; 01; 8; 966-^691098-2511i 2h-kSTotal after proposed cuts1. 01 810731075

Nevertheless, I consider that significant savings can be found on new construction and improvements on major roads.    On this partof the programme I recommend a reduction in England of  1 5 million in 1968-69 and  25 million in 1969-70; for Scotland a saving of 8 million over the two years, and for Wales a reduction of 2 million over the same period.31 .    In addition, I recommend that the Transport Ministers shouldbe invited to issue a circular to local authorities asking them tomake reductions in roads expenditure (primarily on maintenance) forwhich they are res^onsibleo    In my view they should be specificallyasked to reduce their expenditures on maintenance and capital works(apart from principal road construction and improvements) by15 per cent in each of the two years    This would yield savings(G.B.) of about  35 million in 1 968-69 and  1+0 million in 1969-70.Roads1.967-6 8        1,968^69Forecast expenditure 560* 632 679Cut proposed - -5k -71Total after proposed cuts 560* 578 608* Excludes additional expenditure approved since cabinet decisions in July.
32.    In the public expenditure review last summer it was agreedthat various new expenditures (mainly new forms of assistance to public transport) should only proceed provided that the additional cost was fully met by savings elsewhere in the transport block(including receipts from new freight charges).    The Minister ofTransport is now Introducing freight charges estimated to yield some 20 million in 1 968-69 and over  30 million a year thereafter.Nevertheless, I believe we should impose new limits on the grants in the changed circumstances0    I propose the limits should be 10 million in 1 968-69 and  20 million in 1969-70.    This would not,in fact,  involve major cuts since expenditure on the new grants isin any case now expected to be lower than originally forecast.Other transportflu.1967r681168-691969-70Forecast expenditureCut proposed1101 26139- 2- 5Total after proposed cuts11 01 2h134

This will not however meet the whole of the reduction, and the balance must comefrom current expenditure.

G,2    HOME DEFENCE35.    Home Defence (PLDo) expenditure for the next few years is forecast on existing policies to run at about  27 million per annum;it has been held at  22 million for 1 967-68 only by temporaryexpedients-    A review has been done by officials on the instructions of the Home Secretary and myself.    They advise (KDR(67)9(Final))that:-(l) a minimum coherent programme, if active home defence preparations are to continue, would cost about  19 - 20 million per annum.(2)    but if HoD. were put on a care and maintenance basis,the annual cost might be cut to about  1 3 million in1968-69, and thereafter to about  7 -  8 million perannum.I am quite sure that in present circumstances we must put H.D.on a care and maintenance basis.    This would mean that no rewphysical assets would be created, except for two new basementcontrols already at an advanced stage of planning, but existingphysical assets would generally be preserved.    Volunteer services would be disbanded, and planning and instruction would be limitedto what was necessary to enable active preparations to be resumedat some future date.   We would have to recognise that it would notbe easy to recruit volunteers again after a lapse of time, or tobring ourselves back to the present state of readiness withoutintensive effort.    But we cannot now afford to pay  20 million or more every year as an insurance premium against nuclear attack.36.    I ask the Cabinet to endorse a decision to put HoD. on care and maintenance thus saving  1 k million in 1968-69 and  19-20 million per annum thereafter.Home Defence m.i967-o68      1968^69      1969-70Forecast expenditure cuts proposedTotal after proposed cuts22 27 27- 1k - 2022 1 3 7
Ho    , TECHNOLOGY37.    Concorde.      My colleagues are familiar with the technical problems which threaten the success of this project, and withthe continued and dramatic increase in costs - the development cost will be at least  550 million and might rise to 650-700 million (against the present estimate of  500 million)and there are heavy production costs also to come.,    They are familiar also with the legal difficulties which have so farprevented cancellation.   Cut very large sums are at stake,and after allowing for commitments,  cancellation charges etc.cancellation could reduce the burden on the Exchequer by 1+0 million in 1968-69,  50 million in 1969-70 and  53 million in 1970-71.    -An urgent re-assessment of the legal and practicalpossibilities of cancellation in the light of the latestfinancial and technical developments, and of our extreme need to secure these large savings by any means possible, is beingcarried out by a group of Ministers under the Foreign Secretary,,38.    Other.aircraft,  o^ects.    I propose that aircraft projects which have not yet been approved should be removed from theEstimates 1968-69.   By comparison with the 1967 PESC estimates,and after allowing for changes in the programme since last summer,this means a saving of  7-7 million in 1968-69 but an increase of 1.U million in 1969-70.    This would remove from the 1968-69Estimates a contingency provision which is too large because itassumes that each of a number of unapproved projects would in fact be approved in time for a substantial spend in 1968-69.    The majoritems involved are the full development of the R.B.211 engine,the provision of working capital for Short Bros, and the studyphase of a &quot;Minibus&quot;.      Some expenditure may well be incurred on at least the first two of these, but the uncertainties of timeand amount make it sensible to follow the established practice ofdeleting the contingency provision from the Estimates on theunderstanding that a Supplementary Estimate will be acceptedby the Treasury if the need arises.39.    Sp^ace.      The larger part of our expenditure on space is devoted to our contribution to ELE0, from which we have been unable,because of our treaty obligations, to extricate ourselves;    and indeed there may be some increased cost resulting from devaluation.But our existing commitment to ELD0 will soon start to run down,and we should resist proposals for new commitments from some ofthe other members.    We should also urgently seek discontinuance ofthe Black Arrow project - (cancellation would save about 1 million in 1968-69,  2^ million in 1969-70).ho.    Gpy^ernmept Research and ;Technolpgical., Support.      The PESCprovision for these items (excluding the AKA) is  *5h.6 million in1968-69 and  56.7 million in 1969-70.    This expenditure is, ofcourse, on projects which are intended ultimately to improve our economic performance.    Nonetheless,  in our present situation theremust be a limit to what we can afford to devote to investment ofthis kind.    I propose that provision under this head be cut by 10 million in 1968-69 and by the same amount in 1969-70;    and that within this total only those projects should be approved which holdout the firmest promise of immediate and large economic returns.These figures would still allow for a significant increase overcurrent out-turn, but do not include a specific contingenciesallowance for possible new projects such as support for the proposedmerger of computer firms.

i.^ ov^seas,.jmiipifimB1.1.2.   Overseas Expenditure bears directly on the balance ofpayments.    The largest item is defence ( 275 million beforedevaluation).    The next largest is economic aid.    On top oftile normal aid programme of  205 million there is up to 10 million of increased subscription to the international development Association (I.d.A.), about  6 million of food aid under the Kennedy Pound, and mitigating aid to singapore and Malaysia of the order perhaps of  1+3 million over thenext three years, as assessed in the review made last Summer.Diplomatic representation n costs about  1+0 million, Information 30 million, subscriptions to international organisations  1+5 million,Board of Trade expenditure an trade fairs etc.  kA million, andmilitary aid  8 million, apart from South Yemen which was 13 million in 1967-6801+3.    Overseas Aid.      The basic aid programme is fixed at 205 million cash until 1970-71*    Devaluation will lead tosome  10 million of increases in payments expressed in dollarsand other currencies, over and above the rising costs in sterling.    I consider that all these extra costs must be absorbed within the  205 million ceiling on aid.111.;-.   ,InterjiatijmalM.CjDn^ri^huJ^ipns-.    Assessed contributions to international organisations are generally not immediatelysusceptible to action by the U.K., although where these fall within an expenditure ceiling, e.g. CARN and ESRO in the science budget, I must ash for the extra devaluation costs to be absorbed within the ceiling.1+5.

INVESTMENT GRANTS46,     The existing programme provides for the payment of grants in 1968-69 on five quarters&apos; past investment, as a continuation of the process of reducing the time lag between the making of investment and the payment of grant from the initial 18 months to six months.      In 1967-68 there have been two accelerations andthe gap is now 12 months.     Though the Government is committed toreduce the gap to six months ultimately, it is in no way committed to making a further reduction in 1968-69.     It is estimated thatthe cost of paying five quarters will he around  4-40 million,compared with expected expenditure of  -290 million in the current year.     I am sure that having regard to the present u.rgency ofsecuring savings in 1968-69 and the liquidity of industrialcompanies, we must at least limit pa3rment to four quarters.This would cost about  360 million, yielding a saving of 80 million.47.     It would be possible to go further and pay out only three quarters grant in 1968-69, thus saving a further  80 million.Prom a budgetary point of vie?/ this would be very welcome.     Butit would mean that the average time between the making of invest-ment and the payment of grant would be actually increased from12 months, which it has now reached, to 15 months.     It seems likely that industrial opinion would react very strongly against this. &quot;Confidence in the Investment Grant scheme as a whole mightbe&quot;underminded, and serious damage done to plans for new investment in i.968-69 and later.    Moreover, the Government would come undergreat pressure to &quot;restore the position &quot;by paying out at leastfive quarters grant in 1969-70, when on general economic grounds,this might be most undesirable.-&apos; : .Therefore, on consideration, I do not recommend this course.investment Grants1967-61968-69 in.1959-70Forecast Expenditure*Cuts proposed*189440- 80380189360380Excluding grants to public corporations.
L.      AGRICULTURE48.     Public expenditure on the agriculture bloc  (PESO basis) isexpected to be  424 million in 1967-68, and is put at  388 million for 1968-69 and 1969-70.     The big item here is ilgricultural Support( 288 million in 1967-68,  290 million in the two following years).A later estimate for 1968-69 is  318 million.     These are, however,not controlled figures, since the actual outturn in any year is affected by the level of world, and therefore of market, prices,the volume of home production of the guaranteed commodities and,finally, the level of guaranteed prices, which is fixed annuallyat the farm Price Review in February/March.49.     There can therefore be no question of determining a cut of a defined amount.     The actual expenditure in 1969-70 can be madehigher or lower than it otherwise would be by policy decisions aboutthe level of production aimed at, and by the size of the adjustments to guaranteed prices and production subsidies made at the annual review, in order to offset cost increases or provide farmers with higher incomes or better incentives.      It is known that this yearcost increases will reach a record figure of  40- 50 million andwe shall have to decide how much of this farmers should be requiredto absorb by their increased productivity and how much should beallowed to them by raising guaranteed prices and production grants and so adding to the value of the guarantees.     The further issuewill be whether the existing selective expansion programme shouldbe maintained as an objective,  or evon stepped up yet further onimport saving grounds.     The desirabilitjr and scope for this isbeing examined inter-Departmentally at the present time, for reportin early Januarjr.50.     I suggest that, in the present circumstances, the coming farm price review should be condiicted on the basis that  (a) farmers should be required to absorb at least half of the cost increases which by then will have already been recorded, and (b) that thetotal increase in the value of the guarantees should not exceed theremainder of the cost increases.     If these amount to around 40 million this would mean that the Review award must not givea net increase of more than  20 million at the outside.     How muchof such an increase would fall on the Exchequer and how much onthe consumer (e.g, on milk) would have to be determined at the review,     If it is thought necessary to stimulate particular branchesof production (e.g. cereals), this must be done by securing offsetting savings on other guaranteed prices or production subsidies.
N.      SET ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS jarp ^51,     I do not propose any reductions in the present plannedexpenditure on assistance to Development Areas, since the raising of the level of employment there towards the national average isan essential part of Government economic policy,     But this expenditure now totals about  200 million compared with  50 million in 1964.      (It covers Board of Trade Local Employment Act Assistance,R.E.P., the differential element in Investment Grants, and much ofthe Ministry of Labour expenditure on training and employmentservices,)     It seems already that past expenditure is beginning to achieve significant effects, which will be cumulative over thenext few years with the expenditure already planned;   and greatcaution should therefore now be exercised in bringing forward proposals for new expenditure in this field on top of the existingforecast level.     Such restraint is likely in fact to make the  .existing measures more effective, since industrialists are newlooking most of all for more certainty when planning ahead, andare likely to be confused rather than assisted by furtherinnovations in the short term.
0 -      OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES52.     Estimated expenditure tinder this heading in 1969-70 is 839 million, which is almost entirely expenditure by localauthoritiesa     Of this total about  385 million is capitalexpenditure.     Possible reductions of  26- 27 million in 1968-69have already been identified in capital expenditure on water and sewerage, other public health expenditure, parks and baths,accpuisition of land in connection with town and country planning and miscellaneous services.      I propose that we should decide tosecure reductions of at least this amount in 1968-69 and again in1969-70.     Further savings may be possible in these years in response to the messages sent to local authorities by theMinister of Housing and the Secretaries of State for Scotlandand Wales;    and such savings should in any case be sought by apolicy of actively discouraging local authorities from seeking approval for new projects, save where these are absolutely essential.53.     As to current expenditure, the principal means of exertingcentral control over local authorities is through the rate support Grant, on which see section Q.OTHER EHVIROHIvIBHTAl SERVICES m.1967-68     1968-69____1969-70Forecast Expenditure 732 797 839Cuts proposed - 26 - 27Total after proposed cuts       732 771 812
P.    OTHER M?J$PJ VM.5k1-.    Other expenditure is estimated to total about  1,396 million in 1969-70.    Of this total, however, a substantial element is accounted for by items to which we cannot realistically look for contributions to the savings which we need.Railways.....Deficit Grant55.    It includes, for example, the railways deficit grant( 120 million).    The railway deficit in 1967-68 is likely to be over  150 million.    Relief to the . xchecjuer can only beachieved by a most vigorous attack on railways coats and, inparticular, by keeping up the momentum on closures.    TheGovernment has announced its intention that the basic networkshould be reduced to 11,000 miles.      We should set a date -I suggest 1st July, 1969 - when the review designed to achieve this should be completed.    But even so, it would be unwise to count on being able positively to reduce the deficit by1969-70 by a greater amount than that already assumed in the forecasts.Employmentindustry .and. tirade56.    Another important element la &quot;Other employment, industryand trade&quot; ( 229 million), which is forecast to be lower in1969-70 than in 1968-69.    This heading covers employment,services, promotion of local employment, the industrial reorganisation Corporation, as well as other assistance to industry and trade.    Cuts here,  even if feasible, would almost certainly be short-sighted,    (See Section M on development area expenditure).Financial.. /Idmini str a.t i on57.    &quot;Financial Administration&quot; ( 19k million) represents mainly the cost of tax and rate collection, and other similar items of expenditure which are virtually inescapable.Common S or vices, Miscellaneous ^ expenditure etc...58.    Among &quot;Common Services&quot; there is a substantial element( 66 million) for superannuation, which represents simply theeffect of liabilities incurred in the past.59.    &quot;Miscellaneous Expenditure&quot;  ( kO million) includes such things as the Land Registry, the Ordnance Survey and other minor Departments,..    No substantial savings can be looked for here.60.    Finally &quot;Adjustments&quot; ( kl9 million) is mainly NorthernIreland expenditure.6l.    After subtracting these various elements on which, for a variety of reasons, major savings cannot be expected - though,of course, small economies, where possible, must continue to be looked for here as elsewhere - the rest of &quot;Other Expenditure&quot;totals about  321 million in 1969-70./This is
This is composed of the following items:  million196S-691969-70Other Military Defence (excludingMilitary Aid)&apos;*265113Research Councilsetc c8290Libraries, Museums and Arts (otherthan local libraries etc. - see section D)1718Common Services  (excludingsup erannuat i on)91100h5532162.    I propose that on these items we should, secure reductionstotalling  10 million in 1969-70, and that I should makespecific proposals to the individual Ministers concerned.    Forexample, the grant to the Arts Council should be held at 8 million in the next two years,  and the Social science research Council should not be allowed to expand its activitiesfurther;    reductions might also be secured in the estimated expenditure of the other Research Councils,&quot;&quot;United States military aircraft (net);  allied services(provision for headquarters accommodation, civil superannuation,etc.)) and miscellaneous small items.
Q  : RATE SUPPORT GRANT63c    The spending of local authorities is a very significantclement in public expenditure - about  4,700 million in 1968-69*It is distributed- between the various functional programmesEducation, Housing, Roads, etc.).    The capital expenditure 1750 million) is virtually all subject to central government control and will be directly affected by the reductions which Ihave proposed on specific services.   The larger part of localauthorities&apos;current expenditure ( 2950 million), and of theincrease in this expenditure, is also determined by the policieslaid down by the Departments concerned.    It remains true, however,that individual authorities exercise some freedom in the rate atwhich they expand, their current expenditure (particularly, forexample, on Roads and on some of the miscellaneous environmental services - see Sections E and o);  and that they are responsiblefor the efficiency and the economy with which they provide their services.6k.    The Minister of Housing and the Secretaries of State forScotland and Wales sent out personal messages in mid-Decemberurging local authorities to exercise the greatest possible economy.I have suggested (Section E) that authorities should not be urged,to pay particular attention to economies oil Roads *    But we ought tomake it abundantly clear to authorities, as soon as possible, thatsavings will be as necessary in 1969-70 as in the coming year; andwe should indicate the scale of savings that are needed.    TheGovernment will in any case have to determine, at the end of 1968,the total amount of local authority current expenditure which willbe accepted as eligible for Rate Support Grant.    I therefore proposethat, as a reinforcement to the reductions which I have proposed on specific services, we should, announce now that we shall not accept as eligible for Rate Support Grant in 1969-70 a total of localauthority expenditure of more than 3 per cent in real terms abovethe amount eligible for Grant in 1968-69.65.    But if this is to lead to real savings in expenditure, andnot merely to a shift in the financing burden from Grant to rates,it will have to be recognised that some expected improvements in local authority services must be sacrificed.   The announcement tolocal authorities will have to assure them that the Governmentrecognises this; and that it will be reflected in Departmentalattitudes and policies towards the local authority services withwhich they are concerned.
R.    GENERAL66,   The proposals outlined above are confined to major savings,and for the most part to major programmes.    This is inevitable:Ministers cannot collectively examine in a short space of time allthe individual items which make up total public expenditure.    Butit must not be assumed that the items of expenditure which are not discussed should be exempt from examination; on the contrary thereis an urgent need for a searching and comprehensive review of all forms of public expenditure in 1968-69 and 1969-70, however smallindividual items may be.    So far as Supply expenditure in 1968-69 isconcerned, we have already instructed officials to scrutinise theSupply Estimates severely in order to secure all possible savings.I propose that we should issue similar instructions for a generalscrutiny of the items of public expenditure in 1968-69 and 1969-70on which we do not reach specific decisions.    Given a generalinstruction of this kind, Departments in co-operation with theTreasury should be able to identify savings which may individuallybe small,  and probably not very substantial even in aggregate by comparison with most of the proposals which are considered in this paper, but which we cannot afford to neglect.
III   NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES CAPITAL EXPENDITURE67.   Nationalised industries&apos;  investment programmes have already beenreduced by some  70 million for 1968-69 and a corresponding amountfor 1969-70.    Total nationalised industry investment will befalling gradually from this year onwards.   Nonetheless, it will heimportant to continue to keep their Investment on a tight reinand to ensure that the criteria set out In the recent White Paper(Cmnd. 3437) --re very strictly applied.   These considerations apply to the industries&apos; main activities;  in addition, it isproposed that, for the next two years, the extension of theirancillary activities, including purchase of subsidiaries to whichwe are not already committed, he stopped since It can only be financed by increased borrowing from the Exchequer.
IV   SUMMARY68.    In the table which follows are summarised the expenditureestimates and proposals for reductions (to the extent&quot;to whichthey can be quantified) discussed, above.   No allowance is madefor items (such as reductions in expenditure on Concorde) whichare not quantified in the text.
