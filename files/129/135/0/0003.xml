-     17IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)65C(68) 3 COPY NO,___1st January, i960CABINETSALARIES OF MEMBERS OF THE BOARDS OIN A TIONA LISSD IND US TRIESMemorandum by the Chief Secretary,, treasury the Cabinet has invited rne, after consultation with the Secretaryof State for Economic Affairs and the Ministers responsible for the nationalised industries, to put forward proposals on the salaries ofmembers of nationalised industry boards (CC(67) 62nd conclusions minute 3).2,       The attached annex summarises the background to the problem,and possible solutions of it,    I have discussed its substance with some ofmy colleagues, a.s Cabinet asked.    In the course of the discussion it hasbecome clear that there is a deeply felt difference of view among us aboutthe action which we should take in the situation which faces us afterdevaluation.    It has therefore not been possible to put forward agreed proposals;  and this memorandum can only set out the points of view whichhave been expressed, as a basis for a final decision.The case for an immediate increase in salaries3,       There is a strong case for increasing the salaries of board members,and improving their pension rights^ so that they are reasonably comparable with those paid in similar posts in the private sector,,    Some of mycolleagues feel strongly that the present state of affairs is causing suchserious damage to the morale and efficiency of the nationalised industries,and consequently to the whole economy, that it is essential at least to startto put it right without delay.    Although there are clearly political difficultiesin announcing large salary increases for board members in presentcircumstances, they point out that there would be great presentationaldifficulties whenever we chose to announce them.    Successful management of the economy is the best way of convincing the country of the rightness ofour policies - and an important ingredient in this will be improvement in theefficiency of the nationalised industries for which the highest calibre of management (matched by appropriate salaries and pensions) is a necessarycondition.    It can be argued that the difficulties for incomes policy in givinglarge salary-increases to board members can be exaggerated.    The man inthe street will appreciate the need for good management in these vitalindustries and that good managers must be obtained in a highly competitivemarket.    He will also appreciate that there is not all that much difference in take home pay.
The case against an immediate increase4a       On the other hand, it has been strongly urged that it is almost impossible to imagine a worse time at which to announce large increases in the salaries of highly paid people, particularly in the public sector.The success of our prices and incomes policy is essential to the successof devaluation.    We shall be asking many relatively low-paid workers toexercise restraint in wage demands,    For many this will mean a fall intheir standard of living,,    It is hard to see how we can ask this of them,if we announce massive increases in the salaries of some of the most highly paid members of the community:  and it was not disputed that a modest increase at the present time offers no solutioncAn immediate reference to an outside body50      Some of my colleagues have suggested tha.t, even if it is notpossible for us to announce immediate salary increases, we should still take some action at once.     They suggest that we should now refer the whole question of nationalised board salaries to some outside body,such as the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) or a powerfulindependent committee appointed ad hoc.     This would at least demonstrateto the staff of the nationalised industries that the Government was aware oftheir problems and was taking steps to deal with them.    It would stop thedecline in morale v/hich the present situation is producing.    As for theappropriate body for the reference, the natural suggestion is the NBPI,which is the statutory and independent body set up to consider incomescases against the criterion of the national interests     The NBPI is wellfitted to bring a wide range of considerations to bear on the problem,and it is part of the Boards normal procedure to take account in itsreport of all the repercussions of its recommendations.     This wouldbe particularly important in this case, because of the consequential increases for Chief Officers of nationalised boards that are likely tofollow.    On the other hand, it must be remembered that the order of increases that might result from a reference is well beyond what the nbpi normally deal with.    Indeed,, the good faith of the NBPI should it recommend such large increases might be called into question since its recommendations might ultimately affect the pay of its own members,as members of a public boards    Moreover it cannot be guaranteed that itv/ould be possible for us to accept the NBFI&apos;s recommendations when itproduced them.    Either of these eventualities carries risks for the standingof the NBPI,     There is therefore something to be said for referring thequestion to a specially appointed independent committee,    Alternatively,the difficulties associated with a reference to the NBPI could be reduced or avoided if the terms of the reference incorporated a decision by theGovernment that, in the interests of efficiency, the nationalised industries were to be put in a position from which they could compete more effectively with the private sector for managerial talent,6,       However, there are arguments against making an immediatereference to any outside body.    Such a reference would be almost certain to be regarded as indicating that the Government wished togive large increases in board members&apos; salaries, but was unwilling to take responsibility for the decision to do so itself0    Because of this,it can well be argued that the disadvantages of making an immediatereference to an outside body are substantially the same as those ofimmediately announcing large increases in board members1 salaries,
The questions for decision7.       We have then to answer the following questions:-(a) Should we announce forthwith increases in the salaries of nationalised board members?(b) If so, what should be the basis of those increases?(c) If we decide against announcing immediate increases, should we make an immediate reference of the question of board members&apos;salaries and pension rights to some outside body?(d) If so, v/hat should that body be:  the NBPI, or some speciallyappointed committee?(e) What should its terms of reference be?8.       Having put these questions forward, I think it only fair to say that my own view is that we cannot announce immediate salary increases for board members, at this of all times3     The success of our incomes policyis essential to the success of devaluation.    I do not see how we can ask the workers of this country to hold back wage demands in face of rising prices if we give large pay increases to well paid staff in the public sector.    It is not only board members who would get these increases0Chief officers below board level in the nationalised industries would also receive higher pay.     This would not go unnoticed.    No doubt the presenttariff of board members1 salaries creates difficulties:  I do not under-estimate them.    But I do not believe that the present position is untenable.Nor should we overlook that it is possible to pay ad hominem salariesabove the tariff rate in order to maintain the salary of a man from outsideindustry whom we wish to recruit to a nationalised industry post.    after all, the pattern of salaries of the directors of private concerns is by nomeans uniform.     The public will accept that one cannot well ask a manto take a cut in his present pay;  they will not, in my judgment, accept that existing board members should receive large pay increases whenall other sections of the community are being asked to make sacrifices,9.       For much of these reasons, I think it would be wrong to refer thequestion now to an outside body.    Such a reference would be certain, inmy view, to be regarded as an indication that we wished to give board members large salary increases.     The resulting damage to incomes policy would be just as serious as if we announced actual increases.10.       I therefore suggest that we should agree to resume our discussions in, say, six months1, time, and reach a decision in the light of thesituation then.J.D.Treasury Chambers, S,W.la29th December, 1967
ANNEXSALARIES OF MEMBERS OF THE BOARDS OF. NATIONALISED INDUSTRIESAt their meeting on 30th October, the Cabinet invited the chief secretary, Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State for economic Affairs and the Ministers responsible for the nationalised industries, to arrange for proposals on the salaries to be paid in future to members of the boards of nationalised industries, including the reorganised British Railways Board, to be put forward for considerationby Ministers collectively (CC(67) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 3),    Treasuryofficials have discussed the problem with their colleagues in theDepartment of Economic Affairs and the Departments with responsibilities for the nationalised industries,,2,       Officials point out that there is a strong case for a review of the salaries of members of the boards of nationalised industries (&quot;board members&quot;).    The gap between the salaries of board members and men with comparable responsibilities in private industry was significant whenthe level of salaries in the nationalised industries was set immediatelyafter the war.    It is now much larger;  and there is good reason tobelieve that at any rate Chairmen, Deputy Chairmen and board members with the heaviest responsibilities are receiving only one half, or even less,of the salaries paid in similar top posts in private industry.    Moreover,their other conditions of service tend to be less favourable.    This hasaffected the efficiency of the nationalised industries because it has reduced their ability to recruit and retain able board members.3,       Officials also point out that the relatively low level of boardmembers1 salaries has depressed the general level of salaries of seniormanagers below board level (&quot;Chief Officers&quot;),     There is extensiveevidence of the difficulties which the nationalised industries are findingbecause of this in recruiting and retaining able managerial and technical staff.    The importance of the nationalised industries to the economy,and the importance of good management in them at all levels, areunquestionable.    Some of the nationalised industires, such as electricity,have expanded rapidiy, increasing the complexity and size of the problemstheir management must solve.    Others, such as coal, are contracting;but this contraction itself poses problems no less difficult,4,       The difficulties have been increased by the setting up earlierthis year of the British Steel Corporation,    It is net easy to defend the great disparity between salaries paid in the BSC and in the other nationalised industries (the salary tariff of the BSC is shov/n in theAppendix to this note),5,       There is thus a case for a review of board members1 salaries.Officials suggest that there are two alternative bases on which such a review might be conducted,    It might aim at pay increases of a relatively moderate amount, such as 10 or 12 per cent, calculatedfor example by reference to movements in earnings in the economy generally since the last review (April, 1964),    Alternatively, one could aim at. putting the nationalised industries in a position from whichthey could compete effectively with the private sector for managerialtalent by paying comparable salaries,
6.      Officials suggest that the first alternative should be rejected.It would not go to the root of the present difficulties of the nationalised industries;  it would be difficult to reconcile with incomes policy;  itwould provoke criticism, since any increase in what many membersof the public regard as already high salaries would be criticised;  and.it could well lead to repercussions on pay in the public services,,7,       The second alternative, on the other hand, would presumablysolve the problems which the nationalised industries may be thought to face because of inadequate salaries.    Equally, it would presentsome formidable problems.8,       Because salary practice varies widely in the private sector,it is not possible to show statistically or otherwise what rates of pay would be implied by this approach.    Officials suggest, however, thata tariff of the order illustrated below would be consistent with it0(The present tariff is also shown for purposes of comparison).Possible new tariffs  per annumPresent tariff    &apos;&apos;Maximum&quot;(a)    &quot;Minimum&apos;&apos;(a)1,    &quot;Major&quot; boards (b)Chairman 12,500Deputy Chairman 10, 000Members (full-time) 7,000-9, 5002,   &quot;Minor&quot; boards (c)Chairman 11,000Deputy Chairman 9, 500Members (full-time) 7,000-9, 50025, 00021, 000G, 000-19, 00022,50020,0008, 000-19, 00020,00017,5008,000-17,00018,50017, 0008, 000-17, 000
Notes(a) The &quot;maximum&quot; and &quot;minimum&quot; figures are based respectivelyon the figures suggested by management consultants as the limits of an appropriate salary range for the Chairmen of the major nationalised industries.    The relativities shown are roughly in line with those nowcurrent;  they could readily be modified if necessary.    The widening ofthe salary bands for ordinary board members is discussed briefly in the text below,(b) At present this denotes the National Coal Board, the british railways Board and the Electricity Council,(c) At present this denotes the Air Corporations, the Gas Council,the London Transport Board and the Cential Electricity Generating Board.(The Chairman of the Atomic Energy Authority receives  11, 000 a year,but the Deputy Chairman  10,000).9,       Clearly these large increases would present the problems mentioned at the end of paragraph 6 above, and in a severer forme     There could be serious damage to incomes policy.     There would certainly be repercussions,sooner or later, on pay in the public services.    And it would beexceptionally difficult to defend giving increases to existing beardmembers.    (This is one reason for the suggested widening of the salary bands in the illustrative new tariffs above;   another is tnatit is in line with the usual practice in private industry to have quitewide disparities between the pay of directors, even on the board ofone concern),10,       To adopt anything like the tariff outlined in paragraph 8 above would undoubtedly create great problems of presentation.     Officialssuggest that if the increases it would lead to are to be acceptable to public opinion, it would be necessary to secure the endorsement ofsome outside body, such as the National Board for Prices and Incomes,or a powerful independent committee.    There is the further point thatthe good faith of civil servants, in advising on this topic, might besuspected, however unreasonably, because it might be thought thattheir recommendations were influenced by the prospect that they would eventually affect their own pay.    It would probably be unwise to ask the nbpi tc take the initiative in formulating recommendations %  this coulddamage their standing, particularly since it might be thought that theywere interested parties because their recommendations would ultimatelyaffect their own remuneration as members of a public board.     i/ioreover,what would be in question is not the application of incomes policy, but ageneral political decision on the nature of nationalised industry boards and the appropriate policy for their remuneration,11,       Finally, officials recommend that any review should includepension arrangements and the remuneration of part-time board members,,
