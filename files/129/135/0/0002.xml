W. 1.3rd January, 1968
CONFIDENTIAL ... 13ANNEX * &apos;Raising the School-Leaving AgeExisting CommitmentsThe present commitment is to raise the school-leaving age(RSLA) from 15 to 16 in 1970-71.    The decision to do this was announced by the Conservative Government in 1964, and has been endorsed by the present Government on a number of occasions.2,     The effect ef RSLA would be (assuming continuation of presenttrends towards voluntary staying on) to keep in secondary school inGreat Britain about 400? 00G pupils who would otherwise have left inthat year.    Advance preparations have been gathering momentum overthe past two years, and some expenditure on acquisition of sites,planning of buildings and curriculum development (including theretraining of teachers) has already been incurred or committed.    the teacher supply programme has been based on the assumption that the staffing ratio in secondary schools would be built up during the periodof relatively static secondary school population in the late 1960&apos;s inorder to take the extra load in 1970-71 before the numbers begm torise again for demographic reasons during the following decade.     but because, even without RSLA? the staffing ratio in secondary schoolswould not be sufficient for some years to secure the elimination ofclasses over 30, the teachers resulting from this programme would still be employed.    The main savings to be obtained from defermentare therefore;(a) the capital cost, incurred mainly before 1971-72, of thebuildings to house the extra 400,000 pupils $ and(b) the additional non-teaching current costs incurred ineducating these pupils.Savings^3,     The table below gives details of the savings that would beobtained by deferring RSLA from 1970-71 to 1974-75.    In the early years these would be entirely on capital account and, because of the significance of the programme to comprehensive reorganisationgenerally not all of these savings could be guaranteed in practice.(About 70 per cent of the capital expenditure relates to building work;,10 per cent to equipment and the rest to fees and sites. )1968-69   1969-70   1970-71    1971-72England and W a lesCapital 30. 7(a)       43.

(b)    including school meals (priced at Is. 6d. )School Staffing4.     The immediate effect on the pupil/teacher ratio of deferringRSLA from 1970-71 would be to improve it in 1972 by about 1. 8(2. 0 in Scotland) compared with the corresponding figure if RSLAwent forward as planned and the elimination of classes over 30 (inScotland over 40 in the first three years of the secondary course andover 30 in the subsequent three years) would almost be attained by1974 if RSLA was deferred (thereafter of course the position would return to that which would result from a 1970-71 RSLA).    From the stand-point of the pupil/teacher ratio, there is however no date in the1970&apos;s which would provide conditions any more favourable for raising the age than those in 1970-71.General Manpower Considerations5.     The number of extra pupils compulsorily retained at school byRSLA in 1970-71 would be about 400, 000 at a time when the working population ia expected otherwise to be virtually static.     The working population is forecast to fall by about 290, 000 between mid-1970 and mid-1972.    (The effect of RSLA on the working population at the point when it takes effect would not be greatly different in any year up to 1975. )6.     This has to be seen against a background of large demands formanpower for the public sector.    The report of the Official working group on Public Service Manpower has estimated that the presentforecast public expenditure programme implies an increase in publicservice manpower between i960 and 1972 of over 400,000; and a fallin the working population of about half a million (including the effectof RSLA) over the same period.    If RSLA is not deferred there might thus have to be a reduction of about a million employees in the private sector and nationalised industries during a period when efforts arebeing made to strengthen our economic position and achieve a permanentimprovement in our capacity to export.7.     On the other hand, since a 15-year old is much less productivethan the average worker, RSLA will have less effect on the productive potential of the economy than on the total numbers in employment; anda sharp fall in the availability of unskilled young workers might encourage a better use of manpower.    Moreover, the places in Englandand Wales where voluntary staying on beyond 15 is least marked (and where RSLA would therefore have most significance) are the development areas and areas of high unemployment.    More generally., the country will increasingly require more adaptability in its labour force, and overa period of years RSLA should contribute to a better educated working population, although the full benefits of this would not be felt for aconsiderable time.Educational and Social Considerations8.      The Crowther and Newsom reports recommended raising theschool-leaving age mainly for social reasons.    There is much morevoluntary staying on after 15 in wealthier families than in poorer; andthere are also widening geographical differences.    For instance,between 1956 and 1966 the proportion of children ir maintained schoolsstaying voluntarily at school to 16 increased from 17 per cent to-2-
31 per cent in the south-east but only from 10 per cent to 18 per centin the north of England.     There is no reason to believe that thesetrends will be reversed.    Deferment would therefore prolong social and geographical differences, and would leave the less well-off areas with aless well-educated labour force.9.      On the educational side, RSLA would produce a short-term worseningof the staffing ratio in secondary schools.    In the longer term, theconsensus of educational opinion is that despite the marked increase inthe proportion of children in maintained schools staying voluntarily at school to 16 (from 13 per cent in 1956 to 25 per cent in 196b in Englandand Wales) there are considerable numbers still leaving at 15 who couldprofit from continued education.Summary10.     The balance of argument for and against deferment of RSLAcan thus be summed up as follows.    In favour of deferment is the totalsaving of about  175 million over the period 1968-69 to 1971-72; the postponement of a temporary worsening in the pupil/teacher ratios  andthe avoidance of a loss of some 400,000 school-leavers to the labour force.    The arguments against deferment are that it would cause somedisruption to the planning of the school building programmes as a whole;and the other manpower, social and educational considerations set outin paragraphs 7 to 9 above.-3-
