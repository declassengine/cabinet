Yr..O      Vb\:148IMMEDIATE     KUALA LUMPUR TO COffilOMTEALTH OFFICETel. Wo. 21 7th January 1968SECRETFollowing for Prime Minister fron Commonwealth SecretaryDofonce Roductions.I had ny first meeting to-day, 7, with Deputy Prime Minister who was accompanied by Finance Minister, Minister for Education, and senior officials.     I explained British Government&apos;s decision on agreed linesagainst broader economic background.     Eazak said thoy would need time toconsider tho full implications of the statement, in particular as regardsthe Anglo/Malaysian Defence Agreement, before they could give firm views.He could say at once however that Malaysia had always depended on Britainparticularly for more sophisticated forms of defence and had not tho means to take this over themselves.     Thoy were also in economic difficulties,tho price of rubber being the lowest for 18 years, and they had an extensive commitment in East Malaysia which was inherited from the Britishon the understanding that they could look to then for defence help forsome time to come.   The time left before Britain&apos;s final withdrawal at31 st March 1 971 was very short.     He doubted whether Australia andNew Zealand would be able to take Britain&apos;s place, and the United Statesw-as preoccupied with Viet-Nam.     Vdien Britain had no defence capability intho area the ability of her forces- in Europe to help in the Far East wouldbo very limited, nor would thoy bo trained for local conditions.     it seemed to hip. that the defence agreement would then have very littlemilitary significance.     Their main need was for air and naval defence,which -we hava previously promised to supply after our withdrawal.Indonesia was recovering and her future- Intentions unpredictable.     ThoCommunist threat was a real one and would be enhanced by the acceloratedwithdrawal.     He asked that the Prime Minister should bo told that theyregretted the decision very much indeed which left then deeply anxious andwere at a loss to know where to turn to for assistance.3.(Sic).    Tan Slew Sin spoke more sharply than Eazak.     Ho rocitodMalaysia&apos;s good behaviour in keeping highest proportion of reserves in sterling of any Commonwealth country.     He recalled that in 1965 whensterling had been under pressure he had agreed, in response to representa-tions and out of loyalty to the sterling area, to stop a programme ofwithdrawals at tho rate of SA million a week.     He had done this even0)
though ho had some doubts about the efficacy of the measures being takenin Britain to protect sterling.     He had responded to assurances by thelast Chancellor that devaluation was unthinkable, and as a consequenceMalaysia had now suffered considerable economic loss.     He wondered whether it might not become necessary for us to devalue again and whetherthey should expect a further visit proposing an even more drasticacceleration of our withdrawal.     I replied that the very nature of ourdraconian measures was the best possible evidence that wo did not allowtills to happen,k-0     There was further discussion of Malaysia&apos;s difficulty in maintaining a sophisticated air defence system after our withdrawal.     Joint arrange-ments with Singapore were mentioned but the Malaysians felt that thesystem could not be run without our help by 1971 since it would beimpossible to train the necessary personel in time.5.     The Malaysians showed some interest in the effect of these decisions on our future relationship with Brunei,     I said we would need to consider our Treaty with Brunei in the light of these decisions, we had alreadywarned the Sultan last summer that tills was not an obligation which wecould carry indefinitely.6.     In response to a question about Hong Kong, I explained that we wouldbe maintaining our garrison there, which should have some psychologicalvalue in the area as a whole.7. In response to a question about SEATO explained that membership waspossible without earmarking force contributions, as in the case of Franceand Pakistan.8.     Tan assumed that the rundown would now be faster up to 1971 and thattheir economic difficulties would be enhanced.     He hoped that more aidwould therefore be available.     It was explained that in Malaysia theeffects of accelerated withdrawal would ho much less than in Singapore:but the acceleration would be taken count in the aid negotiations.9.     Malaysian Ministers urged that we should help persuade Australia andNew Zealand to play a larger role in our place.     I accepted that regionalarrangements would make sense and said that Britain would be prepared totake up with the other four Commonwealth Governments concerned thepossibility of discussions about defence problems arising from our newdecisions.(2)
10.   R&amp;zak asked if there was any possibility of delaying the public announcement next week but I explained why this would not be possible.If.   Tan asked whether, if the four other Connonwealth Governments hadequal nisgivings, the British Cabinet would maintain their decisions.I replied that tho decisions were firm, but that I would report MalaysianMinisters views to my colleagues on ny return as would the foreign secretary those of the United States Government and those of the persian gulf rulers.12.   There will be a meeting with the Tuhku tomorrow followed by asecond meeting with Razak and other Ministers.13*   Malaysian Ministers wore clearly and with good reason gravely disturbed at the implications of those new decisions.     Razak spoke in sorrow but without rocrimination as at the loss of a good friend and seemed genuinelynonplussed about where to turn next.     They are now talcing stock and thereis likely to be considerably more discussion about the future of the AngloMalaysian Defence Agreement tomorrow.14.   &quot;Wo agreed that nothing should bo said after to-day&apos;s mooting, but woshall have to agree to a Communique tomorrow.     I hope however to be ableto got Malaysians to accept something analyne (sic) which makes no specific reference to an accelerated rundown.15.   I had an early round of golf (which the Tunku won without difficulty and without the help of your telescopic putter!) and will repeat this withRazak tomorrow morning.     I am dining with Razak tonight and will give myassessment of Malaysian reactions after our talks finish tomorrow.
IMMEDIATE.    SINGAPORE TO COMONWEALTH OFFICETelno. 22     8th   January 1968SECRETFollOYidng for Prime Minister from Commonwealth Secretary.Defence cuts.I had the inevitable game of golf this morning with Tun Razakand Ghazali.   I then had an hour&apos;s meeting with the Timku With onlyGhazali present on his side and the High Commissioner and Garner on mine.2.     Tunku said that he had a report on our talks from his colleagues and that he was sad and gravely disappointed.   However he did not want to go into it all over again and said that he would neither cry norcringe nor turn to anyone else and, added Ghazali, not blackmail.Nevertheless he could not disguise his distress.   Malaysia was dependenton Britain and had always trusted her and tried to be helpful.   Unlikeother countries on independence Malaysia had wanted the British to remainand relied on them to protect her.   Without britain&apos;s help she wouldbe defenceless.3.     Of course the worst threat came from China particularly sinceChinese Communists could stir up dissension among half the population of malaysia.   But he recognised that if this threat came Malaysia couldnot hope to meet it.   What he was concerned with was possible threat fromIndonesia or the Philippines, both of which were envious of Malaysia,&apos;sprosperity and both of which laid claims to her territory.   For themoment all might be well but who could foresee what ambitions anotherregime might develop?   The only neighbour about whom he felt complete confidence was Thailand.4.     If Indonesia or the Philippines were to attack Malaysia she would of course resist.    Unless her forces could hold off the aggressors fora month or two Malaysia would not deserve to be helped.   But Malaysiacould not hope to hold out longer than that and it was essential therefore that more sophisticated aid should be available and essential therefore that it was known in advance that such help would come.(4)
5.     In the light of this survey Tunku begged me to press for threethings:(a) He recognised our difficulties and that we could not continue ourvrorld-vri.de burden alone but other countries were also good friends toMalaysia and he hoped that a Five-Power conference could be hold togo into all these matters.   Tunlcu insisted we must take the lead or nothing would happen.(b) He accepted that British forces as such would be withdrawn fromMalaysia and Singapore, but it was vital that help should come from britain if required.    Clear implication was that he would wishDefence Agreement to continue.(c) while he put less emphasis on this he nevertheless attached importance to effect on the economy of presence of British troops and asked for Malaysia&apos;s economic needs to be looked at sympathetically,and hoped that when talks were renewed with Sir Alan Dudley full account would be taken of proposals which I had made.6.     I replied that I would of course report fully to you all that hehad said.    I explained that I should be going on for talks with PrimeMinisters of Singapore, New Zealand and Australia and that if therewere a general readiness for a Five-Power conference we should be willingto lake part.     But that this could not hold up our announcement inParliament, and that the conference must therefore deal with thecircumstances following our decisions.     As regards (b) I told him thatI was anxious that there should be no misunderstanding and explained thatafter our withdrawal we could undertake no automatic commitment and thatany help given would depend on our resources and on circumstances at thetime.     Nevertheless we should have a general capability and british forces would be in the area, e.g. because of our defence of Hong Kong towhich Her Majesty&apos;s ships would go from time to time.     For these reasonswe were ready to continue the Defence Agreement with a re-Interpretationto fit the new circumstances.     On (c) I assured him that the implications of the accelerated rundown would be fully taken Into account in thediscussions which Sir Alan Dudley would have on mitigatory aid.7.     Tunku was extremely courteous throughout.     But he did not disguisethe depth of his feelings and his gentleness of manner made his case allthe more impressive.     You will notice that on certain key points emphasishe gave was at variance with views expressed by other Ministers but thisis not a very quick thinking or efficient administration, and they had only been given overnight to formulate their views.8. See my immediately following telegram for report of further talk withRazak.(5)
IMMEDIATE SINGAPORE TO COmOIP/EALTH OFFICETelno 23   8th January 1968SECRETMy immediately preceding telegram.Following for Prime Minister from Commonwealth Secretary,Defence Cuts,At resumed meeting with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance,Razak said that after giving serious consideration to our proposals he wished me to convey to you the Malaysian Government&apos;s grave concern attheir very serious implications not only for Malaysia and Singapore hutfor the whole region.     Broadly their views were as follows:-(i)   Malaysia had always regarded us as a staunch friend and ally:they depended on us and had no treaty with anyone else, evenAustralia or New Zealand,     Our departure would leave themdefenceless, and they had a deep sense of being seriously letdown.(ii)   There was a Communist threat on the Northern border and, potentially,in Indonesia,(iii)    In 1963 they had agreed to the establishment of Malaysia on the clear understanding that we would work with them and assist them with defence and economic development since it was recognisedthat Sabah and Sarawak vrould be liabilities to them.     Theywould never have taken these territories on without these assurances.     Had they not agreed to take them on we should now still be left with responsibility for Sabah and Sarawak as for Brunei,     They understood our economic difficulties butthey faced these as well.     Our devaluation had cost themmoney:    they had accepted this as they thought Britain was their friend.     They now felt very deeply let down particularlyover the formation of the Malaysian federation,(v)   /sic7 The decision, which appeared firm, to withdraw in three yearsleft very little time.     They would have to make appropriateadjustments and take measures to look after their own interests,and they thought it fair to say that some of them would affectus.     If we had to survive they had to survive too.
2.     I said I had been aware of the difficulties our decisions would create for then.    Tie had made every effort during recent years to avoidthese decisions in deference to our Commonwealth partners&apos; wishes.     Itmight possibly have been better if we had taken them earlier.     If wewere now accused of letting them down it was because we had bent overbackwards to help them by limiting our earlier cuts to a greater degreethan our economy could sustain.    Tie could not be both economically strong and maintain the present sophisticated military deployment outside Europeat the present time.    &quot;Je had no alternative but to make our economy strong and plan our commitments according to our resources.     Although three years was not a very long time Malaysia&apos;s relations with her neighbours were at present good and the stability of the area as a whole was better thanin most parts of the world.     ;7e were in effect only accelerating a decision which had been taken in principle last July.3.     Razak argued that the difficulty was not simply an acceleration of our withdrawal but also that we would no longer retain forces in the region thereafter.     I urged him not to take too pessimistic a view ofour general capability until the military details had been worked out.I pointed to the forces we would be retaining in Hong Kong, which oughtto have some psychological value.4.     Tan Siew Sin stressed the difference in the nature of our obligationto Malaysia and to Australia, Pew Zealand and Singapore.     In essencethis was that Malaya had at our request taken on East Malaysia a thousandmiles away and no one would believe that they were capable of defendingit themselves.5.     On Hong Kong, Tan said we should not underestimate the intelligenceof Peking:   after our announcement on the 17th we were likely to sufferthe greatest humiliation in our history there.     He felt our decision was precipitate and against our own interests.     I said we had weighedall factors before taking these difficult decisions and pointed to theeconomic value of Hong Kong to China.     Tan replied that Peking wasplaying for high stakes and that in this balance sheet the  150 million which Hong Kong was worth to than annually would not weigh significantly.
TOP SECRET1556.     In view of the inconsistencies with what the Tunlcu had said(telegram No. 22) I pressed then on where they saw the external threat toMalaysia.     They conceded that they discounted direct external aggressionfrom China at present hut stressed that local Communists would be encouraged by the announcement of our withdrawal and that we would be making their task of controlling internal subversion harder.     The Communist party inSarawak was one of the best organised in the world.    Moreover with thenew decisions the future of Singapore was unpredictable.7.     After some discussion a communique was agreed which has been telegraphedseparately.     The Malaysians pressed strongly for a phrase implying thatthe defence agreement with its commitments would continue but we got themto accept &quot;they stressed the importance which they attached to the defence agreement&quot;.     On the agreement, they are waiting to see what our generalcapability means in practical terms.     They said they wanted substance andnot shadow, but they accept that at the very least an agreed re-interpretationwill be required.
TOP SECRET156FLASH SINGAP0TJ3 TO COMLIOKHBALTH OFFICETelno 26       8th January 1968TOP SECRETPersonal from Commonwealth Secretary to Prime Minister.Soon after arrival and before any formal meeting, I saw Harry Leefoi&quot; an hour alone tonight (8th January) and for a short tine with Dr. G-oh,Finance Minister.   Lee was fighting mad at what he understood to be our decision.   He had called an emergency meeting of his Cabinet on receivingan account of our proposals from Tun Razak.    what he had to soy, apartfrom his personal embellishment obviously had the collective support ofhis colleagues.2.     lie first of all complained bitterly about my arrival with a unilateraldecision and our determination to make a public announcement of the datenext week.   He professed that he had a personal undertaking from you during his talk in Melbourne that he would have the right to come and talk toyou himself in February before any decision was taken.   He now wants tocome to London to see you.3.     I then had a row with him about the fact that before my arrival hehad given an interview to the BBC television to be broadcast in theUnited Kingdom on night of 9 January, in which he has stated that if we decide to withdraw in 1971 he would have to consider talcing measures against us including withdrawing the sterling balances of  200 million and that he would retaliate against British interests in Singaporeincluding breaking up the monopoly position of British shipping, banking,insurance and the BMC franchise.    I told him this was utterly the wrongway to go about trying to modify our position.   7/e did not respond toblackmail and I could not think of anything better designed to undermineinternational confidence in the Singapore economy than this kind ofpublic statement by its Prime Minister.   He seemed to take this aboardand went off to try to send a personal message to Sir Hugh Greene to seek to postpone the broadcast.   I do not know the result, but the referenceto his threat to withdraw his balances has already leaked to the array of press correspondents here and was carried on BBC world service news tonight.(9)
2f.     Both Lee and Goh declared that they would make a token transfer outof sterling of  5 million or  10 million on Wednesday in London.    they also professed to believe that Tan Slew Sin and Tun Razak would operatejointly with them in withdrawing their balances.   Lee then wont on tomake wild claims that he was in a position to persuade Australia andNew Zealand to leave tho sterling area with them.   His general thesis wasthat we were breaking solemn assurances to them made only last July onwhich confidence in Singapore depended.    Our action would destroySingapore&apos;s future and they were ready to bring this home to us ifnecessary by every form of retaliatory action that they could devise.He added that it distressed him deeply as a man who had been brought upin the British Labour Party to have to say these things but that it was now clear to him that this was the only kind of language we understood.5.     My officials reported to me that they had never in their experiencebeen subjected to such a systematic campaign of pressurisation on thelines above at the dinner table not only by Lee himself but by all membersof his team.    This was a highly organised and militant response contrast-ing strongly with the readiness to co-operate shown in the last round.They do not believe that the accelerated date of our -withdrawal has any direct relevance to our immediate economic problems, and they vigorouslyrefuted figures I produced to demonstrate that they did.6.     Of course during the evening we strongly refuted the Singaporean&apos;spoints and pressed on them our own case.   At our formal meeting tomorrowI shall make a full statement which I will leave with them to insurethere is no room for misunderstanding of why we have to take our decisions.7.     I am bound to warn you and Chancellor that while there is an element of bluff in these tactics It is clear that detailed study hasbeen made of what retaliatory action Singapore could take and thatHarry Lee is sufficiently committed to his colleagues raid strong heo,dedto mean business,8.     Harry Lee asked me to pass to you his request to come to London.   i know that you will not welcome this and there is a possibility that ifLee comes the Malaysians will feel compelled to come as well.    I will ofcourse do my best to ride him off but if he presses this I shall be glad to know what you wish me to say by 0500 GMT 9 January.(10)
TOP SECRET158FLASH    COMMONWEALTH OFFICE TO SINGAPORETELNO. 66 9th Jar-uary, 1968TOP SECRETPERSONAL FOR COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY from prime MINISTERYour Telegram No.  26If Harry Lee is determined to come here we shall of course have to agree and I could arrange to see him (probably at Chequers)during the coming weekend.But there are three points that I should like you to makeabsolutely clear to him if he does decide to comej-(i)      He must understand that there could be no question ofany change in the arrangements for the announcement,on 16th January, of the Governments group of proposals,including the new date for our final withdrawal.(ii)      Jf he comes, he must do so to discuss our joint problems in a constructive spirit with our colleagues and myself and not in an attempt to preach and tc proselytise in apublic sense.(iii)      If he carries out the threat in first sentence of yourparagraph 4 a new situation will have a.risen,    We should then have to consider whether any meeting with himcould usefully be held,2.      I do not propose to send him any written message to the fore-going effect and gladly leave it to you to make these points in whateverway seems best to you.     You were absolutely right to wash his headabout his irresponsible remarks to the BBC which were broadcast heretoday and I hope you will let him know how strongly your colleagues and I endorse what you said.     Our purpose in this exercise must be tobring about the essential changes in our dispositions in the area with theminimum of disturbance and the maximum of goodwill.     Violent and ill-considered reactions such as those described in your telegram can contribute to neither.     Indeed it will no doubt have occurred to you thatif these were translated into action they could well effect our approach to such matters as mitigatory aid and E. G. Bloodhounds.    But this is apoint that I think you will wish simply to keep in mind for the presentand not to use during your current exchanges with him.3.      Finally, I should make it absolutely clear that he never had from me any personal undertaking as alleged in. the remark reportedin your paragraph 2.
