SECRET - -.....    182$DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY lS GOVERNMENT)C(68) 17 COPY NO.__8511th J anuary, 1968CABINETPUg LIC EXPENDITURE;    POST -DE VALUATION MEASURESSPACE; ELDOANDBLACKARROWMemorandum by the minister of TechnologyIntroductionI recognise that the space budget must contribute to the economies in public expenditure that have to be achieved over thenext five years.2.     In practice this means a re-examination of Black Arrow andthe European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO), which arethe main national and international space programmes which liewithin my responsibility.3.     Major economies in this field immediately raise theimportant policy issuet are we to opt out of space technology entirely?Whatever we decide our own national interest must now be paramount.4.      There is no doubt in my mind, or the minds of my advisers,that Black Arrow is the best buy for Britain.    It is the only effectivenational space technology effort that we have, and at around  3 million a year it is very cost-effective in developing a capability in Britishindrxstry without which future exports in space products will simplynot be possible.    It also finances, on a very small scale, somepotentially valuable research projects, like the work on electricalpropulsion.5.      Unfettered by legal or political difficulties I would unhesitatinglyrecommend our immediate total withdrawl from ELDO and the continuation of Black Arrow.6.       In considering the savings that we might possibly achieve bya decision to abrogate unilaterally our membership of ELDO, we wouldhave to take account of the Attorney-General!s advice.    It appearsthat under the arbitration provisions of the Convention we would be liable to pay damages to our other ELDO partners which would be asmuch or more than tiaa cost of discharging our existing cMigaiacrs,to ELDO.7.     However, in calculating the savings under alternative coursesI have conservatively assumed the damages to be equal to but not morethan our present obligations.-1-
ELDO8.     By the end of 1967-68, the United Kingdom will have contributed approximately  50 million to ELDO; and a further 25-26 million is due to be contributed in the years 1968-69 to1971-72, under the programme to which we are currently committedfollowing the Ministerial discussions in 1966 when we unsuccessfullysought to get out of ELDO.9.      Whether any further development programme will be started by ELDO depends on decisions to be taken by Ministers at the SpaceConference due to be held in Bonn, in May/June, 1968, following the review being carried out by the Advisory Committee on Programmesset up at the July,- 1967 Ministerial Space Conference.    Proposals forfurther development programmes will be put forward, and it is probablyreasonable to assume that (as has happened in the international organisation for Satellite Communications (Intelsat) programme)requirements for larger and larger satellites will emerge calling for more powerful launchers.     If there is not a continuing ELDO developsment programme, launchers built for customers would have to carry a burden of overheads which is likely to make them impossibly expensivefor most customers, unless production costs are subsidised.    against this background, the minister&apos;s PESC forecasts assume further development programmes involving a continuing United kingdom contribution of   8. 5 million a year.10.     Our attempts to get out of ELDO in 1966 were abandoned in thelight of advice from the Law Officers (MISC. 110(66) 3, 7th June, 1?66)as to the consequences - in particular that we would be liable to pay more in damages than the cost of remaining in ELDO.    I understandthat the legal position (which is discussed in more detail in Annex A)has not changed in essentials.     The political objections (discussed in annex B) also remain strong - and are indeed accentuated by the factsthat in 1966 our partners agreed to bear an increased share of thecost, and to reduce the United Kingdomls percentage, and that theyare likely to offer us a moratorium on the increased contribution(in sterling terms) that is due as the result of devaluation.Black Arrow11.     To cancel Black Arrow would mean that to all intents weabandoned any national space technology activity and that we shouldeffectively be opting out, almost certainly permanently from a field of advanced technology in which virtually every other major industrialpower thinks it important to retain a capability.    For exampleGermany, France and Japan are all building up their national spacecapability.12.     It would mean that British industry would no longer be able(as it is at present) tn get sub-contract work from the Americanprime contractors for satellites in the Intelsat programme (and it isthe policy of the Communications Satellite Corporation (Comsat) tomaximise the non-American content of this programme);   it wouldrule out any possibility of British industry getting any share of the space segment of any future European application satellite programmes,or those which may materialise outside Europe and America.    Itwould almost certainly mean that we should get a reduced share of the contracts placed by the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO)(partly with our money).
13.      A viable national programme of satellite technology, based onthe Black Arrow programme could be maintained for about  3 million a year.    This would avoid the consequences indicated in the previous paragraph, and v/ould make a much greater contribution to the advancement of our industrial technology than does our present, much larger, investment in ELDO.    And it v/ould put us in a position toparticipate on a larger scale at a later date if, as other countriesassume, satellite technology should prove to be an industriallyor econically important growth point as other countries assume.14.      I should make it clear that although the Black Arrow programmeincludes the development of a small launcher, this is solely as the most economic means of achieving the objectives of the programme, whichis to develop and test components and systems, and conduct research into basic satellite technology;  it is not intended to lead to anindependent large British launcher, and if it had been more economicalto use a foreign launcher, this course would have been adopted.The Alternative Courses,15.      I set out in the succeeding paragraphs four courses, and the resulting savings based upon the table below of the annual expenditurein each of the next five years, broken down into ELDO (currentcommitments), ELDO (future programmes - see paragraph 9) and black Arrow.    These are as in PESC and represent the expected spendon the basis of existing policy against which the savings must be registered.  million	1968-	1969-	1970-	1971-	1972-	5 Year	1969	1970	1971	1972	1973	TOTALELDG -- Current Commitments	11. 3	8. 8	4. 78	0. 69	-	25.57) j 47.1 21.53)												ELDO - Future Programmes	-	1.5	3. 72	7. 81	8.5	Black Arrow	2.4	2.7	2.9	2.9	2.9	13. 8TOTAL	13. 7	13. 0	11.4	11.4	11.4	60.9Course 1;  Cancelling Black Ar		row and	an announcement that we are			withdrawing from ELDO immediately16.      The savings less the liability for damages and cancellationcharges are estimated at  33.83 million total, or an annual average of 6. 76 million over the five years.17.       The consequence of this course would be as follows -(a) It would end Britain&apos;s national satellite technology capability.(b) It would involve abrogating a European treaty with all the legal,financial and political consequences.-3-
(c) It would leave ELDO to continue on its existing programme which we, though no longer members, would be financingthrough our damage payments.    Thus ELDO would notnecessarily be fatally damaged but its continuance would be supported by British contributions, paid under arbitration.This would be hard to explain in Britain.Course 2;  Cancelling Black Arrow, but retaining our commitment to support ELDO on its existing programme18.      The savings would be exactly the same as under Course 1( 33.83 million total;  annual average  6.7b million).19.       But Course 2 would have the following disadvantages -(d) It would end Britain5s national satellite technology capability.(e) It would sustain our European space effort which is lessvaluable than our national effort to Britain.(f) It would cause political difficulties in Europe and at home;but it would avoid the legal argument and damage payments.Course 3;  Withdraw from ELDO in toto as in Course 1 but retainBlack Arrow20,      The estimated net saving from this course is  21, 53 million over the five years, an annual average ot  4. 31 million.21.       This course would have the same lega] and political consequencesas Course 1 but would accentuate the political difficulty and the harm toour international reputation since we should be damaging ELDO whilegoing on with our national programme.    Moreover, because of thedamages we would be likely to pay v/e would still be financing the limited continuation of ELDO without participating in it.Course 4;  Phase out of ELDO as the present limited programme runsdown and then withdraw and keep Black Arrow22.      This would make a saving equal to Course 3  21. 53 million total; annual average  4. 31 million).23.      This course would have the advantage of retaining our nationalcapability;  at the same time we should make substantial savings fromrunning down our ELDO expenditure from its present level of over 11 million a year to just over &amp;j million in 1971-72 and nothingthereafter.    It would also avoid the legal, financial and international difficulties of withdrawing immediately from ELDO.    Thus it would bea policy decision to concentrate on our national programme and wouldalso save substantial sums of money.Conclusions24       I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that we should adoptcourse 4.-4-
25.      One decision that would fall to be made would be whether weannounce this in the statement on Tuesday or not.    In many ways itwould be more convenient not to make a public announcement untilshortly after we have received the review, due at the end of the month,of the European space programme which followed the initiative we tooklast summer.    However, if the Cabinet consider that an immediate announcement must be made we would have to seek to justify it on thegrounds of our serious financial position and our re-assessment of the priorities within our space budget.    Unless we are to make anannouncement we cannot of course claim until later the savings underCourse 4.A.W.B.Ministry of Technology, S.W.1.11th January, 1968-5-SECR.ET
Annex AELDO; Legal Aspects(Note by the Foreign Office Legal Adviser)The attempts made in 1966 to terminate the UnitedKingdom&apos;s commitment to ELDO were abandoned in the lightof the advice of the Law Officers (Misc 110(66)3,June 7 1966) that if our partners took us to arbitration(in accordance with the ELDO Convention) we would belikely to lose.    If we lost, damages could well be inexcess of the cost of our continued participation in the eldo programme up to its completion.   In the light ofthis advice, it was decided that we should seek an agreed solution on the basis of a reduction in the scale of our contribution, a fixed monetary limit on the levelof that contribution,, arrangements for annual reviewsand provisions permitting the withdrawal of the UnitedKingdom if costs should escalate beyond the fixedmonetary limit.    Full satisfaction of these requirementswas obtained at a series of ministerial meetings whichconcluded on 8 July 1966.Although the resultant amendments to the FinancialProtocol provided for the financing of a modified version of the programme and varied, to the advantage of theUnited Kingdom, its monetary commitments under the Protocol,the underlying obligations to which the Law Officers drewatt ehtion in 1966 were unchanged.   What was achieved wasfull protection against automatic commitment toescalating costs above a certain ceiling.   We did not seek, and could not have obtained, agreement to a right for the United Kingdom of unilateral repudiation of our/obligations
obligations.   An attempt by us to repudiate these obligationsnow would attract the same legal consequences as the LawOfficers foresaw in June 1966.   Me should risk losing, atarbitration, more than we would have to pay by completing the programme.   Me should, moreover, forego the substantialadvantage gained in the 1966 settlement, namely   thepossibility of extricating ourselves legally from any liability to contribute to expenditure above a fixedoverall ceiling if that ceiling should be exceededthrough cost-escalation.   We accordingly advise strongly against the course of unilateral repudiation.The question has been raised whether the failureof the French rocket on two occasions gives rise to aright of unilateral withdrawal.    In the absence ofinformation as to the effect of these failures on theprospects of fulfilling the programme, it is not possibleto advise on the question of withdrawal on this ground.
Annex BPolitical(Note by Foreign Office Officials)Our partners in ELDO despite H.M.G.&apos;s sustained attempts to dissuade them, retain their belief that space (launcherand satellite development and applications) is an indispensableelement in the development of advanced technology in Europe,and the elimination of the so-called &quot;technology gap&quot;.    the strongest adherents of this view are Italy, Belgium,  Germanyand France,    The first two are heavily dependent on multilateralspace programmes.      They, with Germany, are the same countries on whose support we rely in pursuing our admission to the E.E.C.and whom we seek to rally against French obstruction.Our attempt to extricate ourselves in 1966; pressed tothe brink of repudiation, came as a severe shock to our partnerswho were all brought to increase their own contribution toELDO in order to retain our participation.     A renewed attemptnow by the United Kingdom to withdraw must be expected toinfuriate them.The European Ministerial Space Conference meeting in rome in June 1967 commissioned proposals for a co-ordinatedEuropean space policy and programme relating together in acoherent whole the various activities in launcher development,space research and satellite applications.     Decisions on theseproposals are to be taken in the early summer of 1968.      TheU.K.,  in particular,,  insisted that the proposals must includeobjective study of costs and benefits.      This study is now well advanced and the problems of European space policy will therefore be brought to an issue in the next few months.      If,without waiting for the result, we were to move against ELDO -/and with it
and with it the European launcher capability - we should find it hard to rebut the charge of duplicity and of having wastednine months of our partners&apos;  time to no avail.It will be plain from the foregoing and from the legalconsiderations set out in Annex A,  that a further attempt nowto repudiate our obligations would tend to maximise theattendant political difficulties.
