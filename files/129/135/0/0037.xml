C(68) 37 COPY NOo        ^20th February, 1968CABINETTHE THIRD LONDON airport memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade andthe Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentThe Prime Minister has directed that the timing of the SpecialDevelopment Order (SDO) on Stansted should be referred to the Cabinetin view of its bearing on current negotiations for reform of the House ofLords,20 Since the Cabinet last discussed the SDO for Stansted (CC(&apos;67) 64thConclusions, Minute 3) the following developments have taken place:-(a) Attitude of House of LordsA major difficulty has been clearly revealed in the attitude of theHouse of Lords,,    When the timing of the SDO v/as being discussed last summer, it was the view of Government and Opposition Leaders in theHouse of Lords that while an Order laid before the Summer Recess was likely to be negatived, an Order deferred until the autumn was likely toavoid this fate.    Opinion in the House of Lords, however, has clearlyhardened and the present view is that an SDO whenever laid has negligiblechances of getting through,.    It is thought that the House of Lords v/ouldeither refer the Order to a Select Committee, or negative it outright.In the first case, there would be no alternative but to co-operate withthe Cornmitteea    ha the second case, the only course v/ould be to intro-duce at the beginning of next Session a hybrid Bill which would itself besubject to committee procedure in the House of Lords.    In either event,therefore, this important decision would be subjected to an investigation by the House of Lords, whose outcome could not be forecast and mightwell be humiliating to the Government,(b) Views of the Local InterestsRunway realignment, though undoubtedly beneficial in substantiallyreducing disturbance from noise, has hi the event in no way mollified thelocal opposition,,    They are clearly in no mood for compromise and weare convinced that further consultation will not produce agreement.    Itis clear that only some form of further enquiry will meet local demands,and our refusal to afford the opportunity for a further enquiry will itselfalmost certainly lead us to trouble with the Lords,DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT)
(c) FoulnessAnother new factor is the proposal of Sir John Howard for aso-called private enterprise scheme to build an international airportjto be leased to the British Airports Authority (BAA) and docks on reclaimedland off Foulness.     Copies of memoranda on this subject have beensubmitted to the Prime Minister and other Ministers and there havebeen initial discussions between Departments and Sir John Howard andhis associates.    We believe that all the arguments against the feasibility of this scheme remain very strong, but it has aroused substantial interestin the Press and elsewhere/here.(d) Expenditure and Defence Re viewsThe question of the deferment of Stansted was raised during the- OCabinetts discussions of the economy measures, even though an-investment at Stansted is expected to be a highly profitable one0It can also be argued with some plausibility, and despite presentviews to the contrary, that the recent cuts in the defence programmemay now invalidate some of the assumptions which made the choice ofStansted almost inevitable.     These assumptions should be scrutinisedafresh.(e) Greater Capacity at HeathrowIt has now been estimated that the sustainable hourly capacityof 64 movements an hour at Heathrow might be increased to 70-72 hithe early 1970s.     This may put off for two more years (i0 eD until 1976)the date when a third London airport is estimated to be needed.3.       In the light of all these factors, we have concluded that we shouldnot proceed with the SDO but should require the BAA, as a StatutoryUndertaker, to apply for planning permission.    This would involve afurther enquiry and we have considered how such an enquiry might best be organised^The Enquiry4.       It would be essential that the enquiry should be sufficientlyauthoritative to command public confidence and to lead to a finaldecision.     This perhaps suggests, though it has its dangers, anattempt at prior agreement with the Opposition on terms of reference,composition and procedure.Scope of the Enquiry5,       The main pressure is for a freshenquiry into the real alternatives to Stansted as a third London airport.     The real issue is London&apos;s airportrequirements.    While it would be possible in the interests of speed toconceive of an enquiry which examined only a number of named sites,it seems preferable to allow it to enquire at large into the location ofa third London airport.
Constitution6. The Town, and Country Planning Bill embodies provisions for planning enquiry commissions whose functions will be to investigateplanning applications of precisely the scale and nature of the airportproject. This innovation has been widely welcomed both inside and outside Parliament and during the Second Pleading debate there were several suggestions that this new machinery should first be used forreopening the Stansted question.7.      Planning enquiry commissions will consider planning applications.They will consist of up to five members and will be required to examinethe general underlying technical and economic background of a proposeddevelopment before coming to consider a specific site or sites wherethe development should be carried out.    Such a commission would thusproceed in relation to this project first through a general examinationof the issue leading to the selection of perhaps one, but more probablytwo or three, favoured sites.    These would then be the subject of aseries of public local enquiries conducted by an Inspector of the Ministryof Housing and Local Government who would be a member of theCommission.    He would report the results of these local enquiriesto the Commission who would submit a report, with a recommendation,on the general issues and on the proposed site or sites.     The Minister,probably in conjunction with the President of the Board of Trade, could then issue a planning permission without reference to Parliament.8,       If a further enquiry is to be instituted, this new procedure appearsto be the most satisfactory and expeditious method of carrying it out.    Itcould lead in a continuous process to a final recommenation which could then be acted upon without further procedures other than those relatingto the compulsory acquisition of land.    However, there will be no powerto set up planning enquiry commissions until the Town and Country Pla.nningBill has received Royal Assent.    It is hoped that this will be given in July,though delay until October cannot be ruled out    It is obviously undesiiableto accept so long an initial delay, and it is likely that the passing of theBill could be anticipated by setting up an ad hoc commission to carry out some preliminary work, this commission being converted into a planningenquiry commission as soon as the powers are available.    It is, however,essential, particularly in this case, to avoid all danger of challenge in thecourts to the ultimate decision on the site, and the opinion of the LawOfficers is, therefore, being sought on the validity of this course of action.9.       The composition of the plaiming enquiry commission provides for members with a particular expertise in the issues involved.    It will notbe easy in this case to assemble such a commission composedof peopleof authority, who command public confidence, can spare the time, possessrelevant expertise and are not committed to a particular solution.     Theywill also need to be persons who can have access to all the defenceconsiderations which affect the various sites which may be mentioned.Their suitability for this purpose will have to be cleared in advance andit may, therefore, in any case be some months before the commissioncan be set up.
414CONFIDENTIAL *?P Nf DPresentational Aspects10.       The presentation of the case for a new enquiry will require carefulconsideration.    Although it is doubtful whether any presentation can avoid the comment that the Government have been belatedly forced into acceptingan enquiry by the apprehended attitude of the Lords, there are certainnew factors which can be emphasised.    The opportunity can be taken to look again at the defence implications.     The proposal for a realignmentof the runways was and is a genuine attempt to reduce the number of people affected by noise.     The decision to consult local opinion on thisproposal carried with it the intention to consider seriously the resultsof that consultation, and the process of consultation has brought to light a number of considerations which the Government could argue need to be explored further.    At the same time a new project for Foulness has beenbrought forward which cannot be ignored.     Moreover, the proposal for planning enquiry commissions and the welcome given to it provides a new machinery which is well adapted and indeed designed for this type ofenquiry, and also provides a new opportunity for a further look at theissue of a third London airport.    We suggest that, in presenting any new course, the major emphasis should be put on the planning enquiriescommission aspect,11.        The main difficulty is one of delay.    From the date of establish-ment of a commission it v/ill be two years at least before Ministers arein a position to take a final decision.    At best, therefore, the decisionmay be ready to be taken during the first half of 1970.     The BAA estimate that it v/ould take from four to four and a half years to bring Stansted tothe fir Ft phase of operation as a major international airport;   six years in respect of another inland site;  and seven and a half years for anestuarial site (though the proponents of Foulness would dispute this).If, as we should expect, Stansted is finally recommended, this delay would be acceptable.12.       It is impossible to forecast what would be the reccmmendationof the new enquiry.    If it named one site, it must be accepted that theGovernment would find it extremely difficult not to accept therecommendation.    And a more remote sea or estuarial site wouldcertainly involve higher construction and surface access costs andwould be less attractive to airlines because of the continuing penaltyof longer and more expensive journeys to and from central London,It is also the case that the BAA are not under a duty to own or manageairports other than the four they already own;  and they might seekfinancial assistance to cover any additional costs.13.       The commission might, on the other hand,  suggest alternatives.If so, we should not have escaped from our present dilemma6    Butprovided we did not propose to differ from the recommendations ofthe commission, we could take the final decision ourselves withoutfurther procedures of any sort, save as regards land.Conclusion14,       We invite our colleagues to agree to the holding of an enquiry into the siting of the third London airport on the lines described and toa very early public announcement to this effect.C.
