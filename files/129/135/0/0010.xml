&apos; SECRET m &quot;121(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(68) 10 COPY NO.3rd January, 1968CABINETPUMi^^g^ffl^J-I^rgj- PQST &quot;DEVA LUATION measures the F. Ill3Memorandum by the Secretary of State for DefenceWe are buying the P. Ill to replace the Canberra, which is now,in face of the rapid progress of technology, obsolescent as an effectiveweapon of war.    It has been in service with the Royal Air Force since195 2.    The RAF&apos;s problems in operating ageing aircraft have become increasingly evident over the past year, when 60 aircrew have been lost in accidents.     This includes four fatal accidents to Canberras.The Military Requirement2.     The operational roles which the F,, 111A would take over fromthe Canberra are primarily tactical and strategic reconnaissance, and long-range strike with conventional weapons; the latter against targetssuch as airfields (to neutralise the enemy air forces), ships (in maritimeoperations) and the transport systems with which the enemy supplies and reinforces his ground troops (in support of the army).     Thiscapability is an essential part of our military armoury, which we musthave available if our soldiers or sailors are involved in any operationsabove the level of internal security.3.      The present Canberra force totals 15 0, of which all but 14 arepermanently stationed West of Suez.     Our order for 50 F. lll!s will support a front line of 36 aircraft - a small force., but a very effectiveone for the operational conditions of the 1970s - which will be supplemented by keeping some V-bombers in service until the mid-1970s and by Buccaneers operating from carriers, and later from,land bases.    Although originally we had planned to base 14 aLciaftpermanently in the Far East we had always intended to hold the major part of the force permanently stationed in the United Kingdom.    last march we decided that since the main emphasis of our defence effort would be in Europe, the whole force would be concentrated in the UnitedKingdom, and assigned co the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).4.     Among the distinctive characteristics of the F. Ill are range ,flexibility and the ability to operate from an unprepared base.    Thesecharacteristics make it suitable for use not only inside Europe but alsoanywhere in the world where we might be engaged in operations abovethe level of internal security after our withdrawal from permanentbases overseas.    The unique characteristic of the F. 111A however, isits capability for penetrating sophisticated defences at night and in allweathers.    This is indispensable for strike in the central Europeantheatre.
5.      Long-s?ange strike/reconnaissa&amp;ce has acquired a newimportance in NATO strategy as a result of changes in the strategicconcept which, after three years pressure largely by the BritishGovernment,   were formally endorsed by the NATO Council inDecember, 1967.     Primarily NATO had aimed in theory atcontaining Soviet aggression by the deployment of conventional ground forces far greater than any country was prepared to provide? butfailing the availability of such enormous ground forces, NATOassumed in practice that recourse to nuclear weapons would be well-nigh immediate and automatic.     The new and more realistic strategyof flexible response, based on the forces countries actually plan toprovide, aims at containing a minor conflict by conventional means alone,or in case of a massive attack, winning sufficient time for a rationaldecision on the use of nuclear weapons.    A necessary condition of achieving these objectives is to deny the enemy air superiority over the battlefield during the conventional fighting.    That is why in December,1967 NATO decided to release for the conventional role 90 per cent ofthe aircraft it had till then planned to withhold for nuclear strike.6.      Control of the air has long been the key to success in groundfighting.    This was most recently demonstrated during the Arab/Israeliwar last summer.    It is very much cheaper and easier to win control ofthe air by destroying enemy aircraft on their ground bases rather thanover the battlefield.    This is the prime purpose of the strike aircraft.The 1, 600 tactical aircraft now deployed in Eastern Europe emphasise the scale of this problem in a conflict which must be brought to an end in a few days if it is not to escalate into nuclear war.    The primaryaim is of course not to fight the battle but to prevent it starting by raising the cost of aggression above the level which the aggressor cantolerate.    Strike aircraft are vital to such conventional deterrence,NATO strike aircraft must therefore be seen to have the ability to penetrate the enemy defences at very low level and find their targets in any weather day or night,7,     Among the aircraft now planned to be available in the alliancein the 1970s only the American and British F. 1-1.1 have the range,performance and sophistication required to deal with the moredifficult targets, although the French Mirage IV has a high-level strikecapability.    Details of alternative aircraft are given in Annex A,The cost effectiveness of the current mix of F, lllrs and V-bombershas been most thoroughly studied.    This mix represents a very greatsaving on the TSR &apos;L programme.    Any alternative programme,approaching the same military capability^ would be much mor^expensive.     In fact there is no alternative programme conceivable inthe time-scale required.The Political Requirement8,      If we decide on a rapid liquidation of our military commitmentsoutside Europe, I believe that the size and nature of our denfence contribution to NATO should be considered in the light   of political-no less than military and economic considerations,,    The american administration^ current drive for savings in foreign exchange pointsclearly to significant reductions in Americars contribution to NATO.
A British decision to withdraw rapidly from East of Suez may addweight and speed to this American trend.    In such a situation our european allies are likely to give particular value to a british contribution of those advanced weapon systems which only the UnitedStates and France are also able to provide.    This applies not only to the strategic nuclear capability of the Polaris force but also to the long-range conventional strike and reconnaissance capability, which isacquiring new importance as a result of the changes in NATO strategy.Since its inception, NATO has relied on the United Kingdom for thelong-range strike and reconnaissance element represented by theCanberra arid supplemented naore recently by the V-bombers.    Thehigh quality of this contribution has compensated in part for the smallsize of our total air effort in NATO.    If we do not replace the Canberras,we must in the next year or two abandon oux contribution in this vital role to some other nation.    The only other nations capable of assuming it arethe Americans and the French.     I do not believe it would be in Britain^political or military interest to face our other allies with such a choice.Nor would the choice be welcome tc our allies.9.      One economic advantage of the F. Ill contribution is that itwould be deployed in the United Kingdom and so avoid stationing costs in foreign exchange.    It is therefore not one of our contributions to NATO which I would recommend reducing, should we fail to makesatisfactory cffset arrangements with Germany.Economic consequences of cancellation10.     Discussions between senior officials of my Department and theMinistry of Technology held in Washington on 1st January, 1968, indicate the nature of the economic consequences which might follow from the cancellation of the F. Ill order.    Details are given in Annex B.    the salient factors are as followss-(a) Cancellation of the order for 5 0 F. Ill aircraft would requireus to pay $87 million in cash during the financial year 1968-69as against the current planned payment of $2?,^ 7 million - a net increase of $64. 3 million in a critical year for our balance ofpayments.    A further $53 million (including $10 million ininterest) would remain to be paid under the credit arrange-ment over the following six years, making a total of$140 million in nugatory expenditure.    In addition therewould be sterling cancellation charges of about  3 million in1968-69.(b) While we might hope that the American Administration wouldresist Congressional pressure to cancel the $180 million-worth of offset contracts already placed, we would almost certainlylose the existing Jetstream contract and the orders for a further15 0 aircraft which Handley Page hope to win later inconsequence.    Hundreds of British firms which have gone togreat trouble, under urging from Her Majesty&apos;^ Government tomaster the intricacies of American tendering procedureswould find their efforts frustrated by action of the BritishGovernment.    British industry as a whole would lose a
substantial and guaranteed foothold in the Americandefence market worth a further  250-300 million (aswell as $135 million in collaborative sales) - a serious disadvantage if we are to effect a rapid and substantialrecovery in our balance of payments.    The value which british industry attaches to this opportunity, and the contribution it can make to their progress in advancedtechnologies is well brought out in three of the recentletters to the Press reproduced in Annex C(c)    The additional $100 million to the offset target for directsales which I have just negotiated at my colleagues1request would of course lapse.11.     The chances of Rolls-Royce winning the engine for the Lockheedairbus - a contract which could be worth $2000 million to $5 000 million -would also be much reduced.    This point is emphasised in two telegrams of 1st January from our Ambassador in Yfashington.Conclusion12.     The only suitable aircraft which is available to replace theCanberra in 1969 is the F. 111.    I am satisfied that the operationalneed for this aircraft is not reduced by the accelerated withdrawalsEast of Suez now in prospect and is substantially increased by recent changes in NATO strategy for which the British Governmenthas pressed.    The economic consequences of cancelling the existingorders for the aircraft would be damaging to the balance of payments.Indeed there would be a substantial increase of the order of$65 million on the United Kingdom balance of payments and budget in1968-69.    Furthermore unless it was decided to renounce thiscapability no longer term savings could be expected.    I thereforeinvite my colleagues:-(a) to agree that the purchase of the 5 0 F. Ill aircraft for theRoyal Air Force should proceed as planned;(b) to note that I have persuaded the United States administration to increase the dollar offset target to $825 million in all,by increasing the target for direct sales to the USA by$100 million.D.W.H.Ministry of Defence, S, W, 1.3rd January, 1968.
ANNEX APerformance of the F.111In all areas of Europe deep support missions in thenext decade will demand an aircraft with an advanced strike and reconnaissance capability, able to pierce sophisticated,defences at very low level, in all weathers, by day or night,to gather intelligence using a v/ide variety of sensors or to deliver a range of weapons, conventional or nuclear.   Thisis the role envisaged in Europe for the P.111.    It is a function that the V-bombers cannot take over from the Canberrastrike/reconnaissance force.   Although their range and bomb-load gives them a useful role on the flanks of NATO, theyhave not the appropriate reconnaissance capability and their ability in the conventional strike role to penetrate thesophisticated defences of the Central Front in the 1970swill progressively diminish.    Similar operations will alsobe required, on the flanks of NATO - in the NORTHAG area and in the Mediterranean, where the defences, though no lesssophisticated, may be less dense, and ranges will be longer.2.     The F.111 meets all these requirements.    There is noother aircraft which can do so, and be in service when required in 1969.    In development it has already demonstratedits ability to perform with full manoeuvrability at twice the speed of sound.   The ferry range of 3000 nautical milesnow seems assured.   The radius of action in various opera-tional sorties relating to the European theatre is illustratedon the maps attached at Appendices A and B.    The long range of the F.111 enables it to be operated from bases in thiscountry, thus, incidentally, avoiding the foreign exchangecosts of maintaining airfields on the Continent.      Militarilythis renders it secure from surprise attack, and any attempt by the Soviet powers to eliminate the force on the groundwould involve an extension of the area of conflict, therebyincreasing the risk of escalation into the nuclear phase.3.     In brief, the value of the F.111 as a NATO weapon isthat:-a. Its sophisticated characteristics and UK basemake it an essential element in the credibility ofthe deterrent.b. Its reconnaissance and strike capabilityenable aggressions to be detected and identified,then dealt with rapidly, effectively and withoutpremature recourse to nuclear weapons.c. The force can be based in the UK.d. It can be used wholly or in part for operationselsewhere, if required, with only a temporarydetriment to the capability of our NATO-assignedforces.Possible Alternatives to the F.111KWe could not cancel the F.111 and put *0^fS^r^tionplace without reducing the size and value of our contribution?f5 J   I&quot; ficld to which SAC EUR attaches the highestmpoftance.d ^operational ability to ^w^llta^contingencies outside Europe would also be aifcctedTheoretically, there are two possibilities which migm: doconsidered:-
1?63 a- wa. Increasing the size of the ground-attack force,i.e, buying and operating more Phantoms, Jaguars andHarriers.    The Phantom, which was not designed as astrike aircraft, has nothing like the range of theP.Ill (see maps at Appendices A - B):    its maximumbomb load is far less and its reconnaissance capabilityand ability to attack targets is limited by weather conditions.    The Jaguars and Harriers,  though effective in the ground support role, have even greater limita-tions in the strike role, e.g. a complete lack of all-weather capability and very short range.    Moreover, weare already under pressure from NATO to increase the size of our ground-attack force while maintaining ourstrike/reconnaissance contribution.    But whatever the size of the ground attack force we provided they could never supply the operational capability provided bythe small force of P.Ills.    Furthermore, ground attackaircraft would need to be deployed on the Continent,for reasons of range ana readiness, and considerabledeutschmark expenditure would be involved.b. Buying a British strike/reconnaissance aircraft to fill the gap.    The only type for consideration in thetime scale is the Buccaneer.   The c urrent -vers i-oaa-of-, the-f%kiy-w.      i^^hf^ Buc-ea*ie-er has been in service with the Navy since 196.1.^l^X is designed for strike only against ships or easilyidentifiable land targets.    Its introduction into service in the 70s even as a stop-gap until the arrival of a more advanced combat aircraft would not makemilitary sense.   A fully developed, but still subsonic,version of the aircraft:, the Buccaneer 2** possessinga nav/attack system of the full standard required forlow level all weather strike against land targetscould not be available until 1975.    Moreover, althoughconsiderably greater numbers of Buccaneer 2**s coulddeliver the same weight of weapons as the smaller number of P.111s they could not perform the fullreconnaissance task.    It would also be necessary to fill the gap between 1969 and 1975 when the Buccaneer2;--* would enter service, by keeping the maximum number ofV-bombers squadrons in the front line, though in termsof capability and numbers these would in no waycompensate for the absence of the P.Ills.    Indeed, to rely exclusively on our remaining V-bombers to providethe spearhead of our NATO forces for the first halfof the 1970s would be a weakness both in political andmilitary terms which could not be compensated by theintroduction at the end of that period of a type whichwe have already publicly rejected (Cmd 2901).   the advance over the current design is not great enough tooffer any technological benefit to industry,  the gap in production would be awkward to overcome, and therewould be no sales prospects for such a project outsidethis country.5. Neither of these possibilities offers any military,economic or industrial advantages over the P.Ill to make its worth pursuing.


ANNEX BPlnjnciai consequences of cancelling or reducing the F.111ProgrammeThe total programme costs, i,e. capital, R &amp; D and operating costs for the F.111 in sterling and dollars (atthe new exchange rate) over the period up to April 1976 arenow estimated at about  kOO million, or some  kO million ayear.    The capital costs of the aircraft and its supportingequipment are spread over this period, and two later years under the credit loan agreement,    We have an importantprotection against cost growth (except that attributable to increases in the prices of labour and materials)  in the ceilingprice for the basic aircraft settled in 1965, and thesupplemental ceiling for the special features of the Britishversion negotiated last October,    Moreover our agreement topurchase 50 aircraft is parallelled by an American obligationto purchase or sponsor purchases of military equipment in thiscountry to offset the foreign exchange cost of the programme(the Offset Agreement),    The target figure for such purchaseswas originally set at 725 million dollars, which matched theestimated dollar content of the P.Ill programme.    This figure is now out of date due to inflationary increases in the us and cost growth in ancillary equipment since the order was placed.   However, I have recently secured the agreement ofthe US Government to increase the target by 100 million dollars.    The possibility of further extending the offset agreement to cover any further increase in dollar costs from whatever source is not excluded.2.     The advantage of the Agreement is that it enables us toby-pass American preference terms and to compete in theUnited States on equal terms with American competitors.    Wehave already received orders worth 180 million dollars underthis Agreement (and there are more on the way), as well asthe Saudi Arabian deal, worth about 265 million dollars.Over the next three financial years our expected foreign exchange receipts from orders already placed exceeds ourforecast outgoings under the P.Ill contract by some 50 million dollars.    A table of progress under the Offset Agreement isattached at Appendix A.3.     Officials of my department and of the Ministry of technology have recently been discussing with the Departmentof Defense on a contingency basis the possible consequences of cancellation of our order for the P.111.    While thefigures must be treated with considerable reserve, thefinancial effects are estimated broadly as follows :-a. If we were to cancel the P.Ill outright, and put nothing in its place, we should save all the kO million a year referred to in paragraph 1.But we should have to pay cancellation chargesestimated at about  60 million ( 57 million in dollars,) of which  38 million would fall to bepaid in 1968/69.    This would amount to nearlyfour times our forecast dollar expenditure on theaircraft in that year.b. Cancellation of the P.Ill would in theAmerican view so upset the overall balance between us/UK expenditure on which the offset arrangement was based that there would be virtually no more/direct ..,ECRET
SECRETdirect sales contracts - the order for Jetstreamrecently obtained would be lost and of course theincreased target of 100 million dollars would hevoid.   Whilst the Saudi Arabian deal worth 265million dollars might not he at risk, and mostexisting contracts would probably be completed,some might he in jeopardy because of politicalpressures on the Department of Defense.    Thebalance of over U00 million dollars to come inthe years ahead would be lost but in the circum-stances an even more serious loss would be theunique opportunity, particularly for numbers ofsmall firms, of establishing a firm and permanentfoothold in the American market.
Appendix Ato Annex BFillPROGRESS ON OFFSET SALESSales to the United states to meet the foreign exchange cost of the Fill programme the US Government agreed in February 1966 to use its bestefforts to procure defence equipment from the United Kingdom.A target of $325 million was established for such purchasesover the US Fiscal Years 1966-1977.    This target has recentlybeen increased to $h25 million.    To date orders have beenreceived worth over $180 million.   Details    are shown in theattached appendix.The opportunity to compete in the US defence market on equal terms with US industry has excited considerable interestin many areas of British industry.   Nearly AOO firms have put their names forward to the US authorities as potentialsuppliers and the number is increasing steadily as time goes on.    In addition details of many hundreds of items of british equipment have been sent to the US Department of Defense forevaluation.This is no mean achievement in less than two years sincethe procedures involved in matching US military needs with british capabilities in the defence field are necessarilycomplex and time - consuming.    It was not to be expectedthat every UK bid would succeed but the experience gainedhas been of great value for the future.   Provided that thebasis of the arrangement is not undermined, we may hope thata firm foundation is being laid for a continuing trade inthis field.The search for export outlets for British industry iscontinually widening and British businessmen are penetratingfurther into this important sector of the US market.   As an example, a small mission from the British Aerospace equipmentindustry will be visiting US defence procurement agencies andUS defence contractors in January 1968.    Such contacts oftenbring business outside the defence sector but the reverse isalso true and it is becoming increasingly necessary to evolveand develop an effective liaison between civil and militaryexport efforts.Marketing techniques are being adapted to the Americanscene.    The US preference for face-to-face contact is being exploited, although this often requires a radical change intraditional British business methods.Representatives of British industry are also attendingadvance planning briefings held by the US Army to discussfuture problems and it is hoped that this facility will shortly be extended by the US Navy and US Air Force.All this is enabling the British defence industry to adapt its research and development, production and inspectionmethods and sales techniques to the requirements of the USdefence market./Co-operative ...
Co-operative sales in addition to procuring defence equipment from theUnited Kingdom, the US Government also agreed to co-operate in promoting sales to third countries when this was a mutualinterest.   One major deal worth ahout $265 million in foreign exchange for the supply of an air defence system to SaudiArabia has already been achieved.   A target of $hOO million for such sales was established and we are strenuously resist-ing American claims that the Saudi deal is itself worth$hOO million.    It is often alleged that the Americans gave nohelp to us over the Saudi Arabian deal because their firmscontinued to compete with ours after the understanding wasreached between the two Governments.    The point is that theUS Government stood aside and that we should not have got the contracts otherwise.Receipts from Offset SalesOver the next three years, receipts from offset saleswill exceed the payments of interest and repayments of capitalon the loan for the purchase of the Pill aircraft as thefollowing table shows:1968/69 1969/70 1970/71g MILLIONS67.2 119.089.9 208.951.k 67oO22.2 20.373.6 87*3139.0 226.3PaymentsAnnual 22.7Cumulative 22.7ReceiptsSales to the US hi.ACo-operative Sales 2h.total 65ohCumulative Total 65.U

Times3rd Jan 1968&apos;Development work from Sir Leon BagrilSir.-Mr. J. If. S. Green in his letter(January 1) about the importance of theJ-&quot; III off-set agreement omits one point of substantial significance.The existence of (he agreement has, forinstance, made it possible for Elliott-Auto-mation lo oblain five contracts for the[United Stales defence services which, withoptions, already exceed $60,000,000 in value. Each of them has contained a sub-Islantial clement of development work. Thislias, to some extent, replaced the workwhich was stopped at the time of the TSR2 cancellations, and has made it possibleto retain the highly qualified scientists and[engineers required to undertake this tcch-Inolopcally very advanced work.ji Britain is to keep up at all in advanced technology then there must be projectsupon which our scientists can work. We(have already seen the damage which sud-;dcn cancellations can do: the possibilitythai this developing market in the UnitedStates for the products of British brains[might again be closed to us is a cause for considerable concern, the more so because[the long-term benefits which may accrue to us as a result of establishing ourselvesthere greatly exceed the size of tho presentorders.Yours faithfully,LEON BAGRIT, Chairman, Elliott-Automation Limited.P.O. Box 2LS, w.l.135Times Financial -Times1st Jan 1968 3rd Jan 1968F 111 CONTRACTFrom Mr. J. H. S. GreenSir, It is now widely realized that theGovernment may be on the point of can-,celling the Fill contract.It is not our responsibility as managersand businessmen to lay down British mili-tary requirements, or to comment on the wisdom or otherwise of the original order for American aircraft, but we arc con-vinced that your readership, and indeed thecountry as a whole, should be aware ofthe immense advantages which can how to British industry from the present off-setagreement, and which will certainly be lostif the Fill is cancelled.Under the existing agreement, the UnitedStates Government is committed to place$.32.5m. of orders for defence equipment inthis country. These orders may includeanything from typewriters to aircraft, andBritish firms are entitled to equal con-siclcration without the normal tariff barrierand without the application of the &quot; BuyAmerican &quot; Act.Some 400 firms have tendered, some ofIwhom would not otherwise have attempted :to penetrate the United States market, let alone to learn the oriental intricacy ncces-sary for a Department of Defence tenderForty firms have so far succeeded in gettingcontracts worth, to date, over SI80m.Some commentators, and notably your own reporter on Friday last, have suggestedthat even if British firms succeeded in ob-taining contracts to the limit of the off-setagreement, it would still be in the country&apos;economic interest to cancel the F 111. we wish to emphasize our total disagreement with this view. To begin with, our under-standing is that the extent of the off-setagreement is still flexible.Second, the United States Governmenthas already made progress payments on60 per cent of the British F 111 contract,for which the British Government are, prc-sumably, liable ; third, and most important of all, British firms have succeeded, through this agreement, in establishing a bridgeheadI in the United States which could transformtheir export performance for the forcscc-able future. For instance. Handley PagoLimited, who have just succeeded in sellingII Jetstream aircraft to the. U.S. Air force for  2,250,000, anticipate that if the off-setstands, this order will, in the normal course,be followed by further contracts for any-thing up to 150 aircraft worth between 50in. and  60m. An order of this magnitude-tude could have far-reaching implications for the future of our whole civil aviationindustry, in the world&apos;s fastest growingmarket; a market at which the aircraft inquestion was specifically directed frominception.Finally, those firms and they arc amongthe most enterprising in the country whohave genuinely accepted the challenge ofthe olf-sct agreement, have invested large sums on research and development, for theAmerican market and incurred other very heavy expenses, which could never be satts-factorily recovered if the agreement wereto be suddenly terminated to serve shortterm political ends.Wc submit that to choose such a course at this particular time of economic difficulty would be both grossly unfair to the british firms concerned and a most damaging blow to the country&apos;s export effort and indeed it may well be that the net gold flow overthe next two (crucial ?) years is in Britain&apos;s favour since the F 1&apos;11&apos;s are on 10 years&apos;credit and the British sales are on a cashplus progress payments basis.Yours faithfully,j. H. S. GREEN, Managing Director,Handley Page Limited.Colney Street, St. Albans, Hertfordshire,Dec. 31.F.111 and OffsetSir, As one of the company&apos;which has benefited from the off-;-,set agreement, against the cost of !the FT-111 contract, through orders from the U.S. Navy Department)for a prototype tug and salvage.!vessel towards the end of l%6 and .for two further vessels of this typein September, 1967. having a total value of S24m., we arc most pcr-disturbed at the Governments investi-gation into the cancellation of partor the whole of the F.1 II contract.Wc cannot comment on any liiili-tary necessity or otherwise of theF.11 I aircraft but the benefits ofthis off-set agreement extend much further than compensating for partof the dollar cost of this aircraft.We. and other firms, who have obtained some of the SI80m. of jwork already placed under this off-set agreement, have had our first opportunity of entering the Amcri- ican market.   A number of these companies, like ourselves, will cx-,pect to continue in the Atricrican .market after the present orders arcfulfilled and our American custo-mcrs  have  been  satisfied, which .,thcy will be, on price, quality and .performance.j   Although we have sold our ships &apos;.to more than thirty countries, until ;this opportunity arose, wc were tin- jable to enter the American market,it is not unreasonable to expectfollow-on orders to British com--panics, after the completion of theactual   orders  under   the  off-setagreement, to an extent that couldvery well exceed the total cost of.the F.111 contract and maintain&apos;exports to the U.S.A. for years ahead on equipment which hithertoit has not been possible to sell tothe U.S.A.The gesture this week from Prcsi-dent Johnson to increase theamount of arms purchases directly from the U.K. by SlOOm. must notbe set aside.In our case, wc believe that ourpresent contracts arc secure, as wcknow of no provision for cancclla-tion. but any action taken by our government, which may prejudice the cancellation of the unfulfilledj value of the off-set agreement, will-not onlv dcrjrivc the country.jmrnc-j diatcly of the balance now out-; standing (S245m.) but, as I have&apos; indicated, would also destrov any opportunity of continuing exportsof this type to the U.S.A.&quot;President Johnson has also, outof all   the countries in  Europe,given special exemption to the U.K.from his complete ban on Amcri-can investment overseas, surely, it.is unreasonable to suppose that wc; have any right to the continuedimplementation of these generousconcessions if. on our par, we go iback on our undertaking in respect-of the F.1 II contract. The reper-:. cussions from a substantial cancel-lation of this contract must be sodamaging that they cannot be con-tcmplatcd.harry L. dowsett,Executive Chairman, jBrooke Marine, Ltd. great jord,Stamford, Lines., J
