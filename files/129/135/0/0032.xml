CONFIDENTIAL -        378DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BR.Britannic MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENT)652118132 COPY NO.____12th February, 1968CABINETTKEjAGE^OJ^^torrtyMemorandum by the First Secretary of state on 2nd November (CC(67) 63rd Conclusions, Minute 5) theCabinet considered the report of the Committee on the Age of Majority(the Latey Committee),    They were on balance in favour of the proposalsof the majority of the Committee that the age of full legal capacityshould be reduced to 18 for all purposes, but deferred a final decisionpending debates on the report in Parliament and consideration by theHome Affairs Committee of the implications of reducing the age of majority on the age of voting and on the wages of young people between18 and 21.2.      The Home Affairs Committee have now considered these matters and have reaffirmed their view that the recommendations of the majorityof the Latey Committee should be accepted,    The Parliamentary debatesaroused comparatively little interest and raised no new considerations to affect the decision.    On voting, the Committee considered that a reductionin the age of full legal capacity would result in pressure for a correspond-ing reduction in the age of voting, but they considered, nevertheless,that acceptance of the Latey Committee !s recommendations would not commit the Government to any particular view on the age of voting andthat the principal factor here would be the recommendations of the speaker&apos;s Conference.    On wages, the general view was that the incomes policy was not likely to be seriously prejudiced by a reduction in the ageof majority, though some members thought that it would be unwise at thepresent time to make any change which might invite pressure for higher wages however small that pressure might be foreseen to be.Tlie Parliamentary Debates3.     The Latey report was debated in the House of Commons on20th November, immediately after the statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer on devaluation.    In the circumstances it was hardly surprising that the debate attracted only moderate interest.    Generally speaking,members who spoke from the Government side supported the LateyCommittee&apos;s recommendations, including those made by the majority.So also did the spokesman for the Liberal Party and the ScottishNationalist.    Sir John Hobson and Mr. Quintm Hogg, for theConservative Opposition, expressed doubt whether the case for changehad been made out and found little evidence of a demand for a change.Several speakers thought that consideration of the age of majority shouldnot be divorced from that of the age of voting.
4,      In the Hcajse of Lords the majority of speakers were in favourof the Latey Committee rs recommendations, including those of themajority, but on the question of reducing the age of marriage withoutparental consent there was a fairly even division of opinion,    As in theHouse of Commons, some speakers thought that it would be unsatisfactoryfor the age of majority to be different from the voting age,Voting Age5.      The Home Affairs Committee considered a memorandum by theLord President which indicated that public opinion, as shown in a succession of public opinion surveyst appeared to be moving towards agreater readiness to accept a reduction in the voting age to 18.    AGallup Poll in 1954 showed that 63 per cent disabled-greed with a reduction.In a National Opinion Poll in 1963 the figure had dropped to 61 per cent,and in 1965 to 49 per cent,    A higher proportion cf older people than ofthe young were opposed to change, and a Gallup Poll last year showed that among the 18 to 20 age group 5 6 per cent were in favotir of a reduc-tion of the voting age to 18.     Such surveys as have been carried out onthe voting preferences of the 1.8 to 21 age group give differing resultsand point to no firm conclusion.    The group is probably fairly equallydivided between supporters of the Government on the one hand and cf theOpposition parties on the other.    It is significant, however, that in theGallup Poll last year 33 per cent of the age group said that thoy would either not vote or did not know whether they would vote.    The effect of reducing the voting age seems likely to depend, therefore, on the successof the parties In persuading the newly enfranchised age group to go to thepolls.6,      The majority of the Latey Committee, from whose terms ofreference the age of voting was excluded, said that it did not seem tothem that changes in the civic, field were at all likely to follow changesin the private field, and added;   ,EIt is a very different thing to copeadequately with one-:s own personal and private affairs and to measureup to public and civic responsibilities&quot;.     The Home Affairs committee thought, however, that if the Government accepted the recommendationsof the majority of the Latey Committee they would certainly be pressed tobring the voting age into line, if only because it would be illogical togive young people adult status in the respects proposed but not the elementary right to a voice in national affairs.    The pressure from ourown supporters would no doubt be sharpened by the fact that our Manifestofor the General E3.ection of 1966 mentioned that the Labour Partylsevidence to the Speakerf 3 Conference advocated a voting age of 18.Nevertheless, the Committee took the view that by accepting 18 as theage of legal majority the Government would not be committed to acorresponding reduction in the voting age.    The Speaker fs conference are understood to be about to report, and it may be that they will advocatesome age other than 18.    Normally the Government would accept therecommendation of a Speakers Conference, and, since the conference are reporting in the knowledge of the fact that the Government have found themselves, in broad sympathy with the recommendations of themajority of the Latey committee it may be assumed that if they recommend an age other than 18 it will be because they consider thatthere are sound reasons for distinguishing between the age of fulllegal capacity and the age for enjoyment of the franchise.-2-
The implication for wages of reducing the age of majority to 187&apos;      The potential cost the Home Affairs Committee were informed., on the basis of ajoint examination of the problem by officials of the Treasury, theDepartment of Economic Affairs, the Scottish Office and the Ministry ofLabour, that the information required to form a reliable estimate of thecost of paying adult rates to employees under 21 was not available, butthat a bffoad estimate of the order of magnitude of the. extra cost suggestedabout  100 million, or 0.5 per cent of the national wages and salaries bill,subject to a significant margin of error.    If it did arise, this increase would be spread over a period;,8.      This calculation is based on the following facts,     Already mostwomen in the manufacturing industries are paid adult rates at 18.Therefore, any increase would be largely confined to male workers.The average earnings of women aged 21 to 24 are about 35 per cent higher than those of women aged 18 to 20.     This is because the olderare at higher levels on incremented scales, greater skill, in moresenior posts etc.    A similar differential would probably exist on the maleside, even if adult rates were paid at an earlier age.     A differential of35 per cent befcwsen the earnings of boys aged 18 to 20 and those of men aged 21 to 24 would be produced by increasing the earnings of boys by10 per cent.    This would cost  70 million, and consequential increases for boys between 15 and 17 would bring the total up to  100 million.9.      WS^-^^R^J^^E^^JlL^^P have to be^paic^at \%JThe question remains whether reducing the age of majority wouldin fact result in successful pressure for the wages of 18 year-olds to riseto the adult level.    Here a distinction is drawn between manual and non-manual occupations, and in the first category between the skilled and the unskilled.10.     In non-manual occupations many employees are covered byagreements providing for annual increments related to age, from school-leaving age to well past 21.    It can be assumed that such employeeswould not be directly affected by a reduction in the age of majority, andit is thought unlikely that there would be widespread pressure for thepayment of adult rates at 18 in non-manual occupations.11.     In manual occupations the important factor is the length of apprentiship, since it is unlikely that adult rates could successfully be claimed before apprenticeship was completed.     On the other hand, areduction in the age of majority would give some support to the existingpressure for shorter and more condensed apprenticeship.     It is thoughtunlikely, however, that, the period would be reduced to less than three orfour years, and hence that many youths would have completed theirapprenticeship by 18.12.     It is unlikely that male manual workers who are not apprenticescould form an effective pressure group to secure adult rates at 18jmost girls in manufacturing industries already have them.-3-
38113.     Scott is h ^2^J^2&apos;22^ -Under Scottish law the age of majority is also 21, but minors(i, e. boys over 14 and girls over 12) have for a very long time enjoyedcertain rights not paralleled in England.    These differences have notled to pressure for the payment of adult rates earlier in Scotland thanin England, but it would not necessarily follow that a reduction in theage of majority in England and Wales would not lead to some pressure for the payment of adult rates at 18, and, if it did, Scottish organisationswould plainly follow suit.,14.     The Home Affaire Committee considered on the basis of this information that, while some pressure for adult wages at 18 might result from a reduction of the age of majority, the effect on prices and incomes policy would not be considerable, and the pressure would not makeitself felt for some time bearing in mind that legislation to implement the Latey report could not be introduced before the 1968-69 Session.The majority of the Committee thought that in these circum.stances thepossible effect on wages was not sufficient to justify a decision not to implement the Latey report, but they recognised that there would be somepsychological effect,, and some members considered that even this oughtto be avoided in the current situation.Conclusion15.     The Home Affairs Committee accordingly reaffirmed their viewthat the Government should accept the recommendations of the majorityof the Latey Committee.    They consider that a decision on the full ageof legal capacity can be taken independently of a decision on the age f orthe exercise of the franchise,, which need not be the same, and that the somewhat speculative effect of a reduction of the age of majority on thewages of young people is not hi itself e- sufficient ground either for rejecting the recommendations or for deferring a decision.M.S.70, Whitehall, S.
