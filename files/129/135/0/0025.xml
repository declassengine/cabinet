DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT)C(68) 25 COPY NO.       P18th January, 1968CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1967-68Memorandum by the Lord President of the council the Cabinet invited me to arrange for the Future legislation committee to review this Session&apos;s legislative programme and to decide whether any Bills would need to be deferred to a later Session, and, if sOjwhich (CC(67) 64th Conclusions, Minute 1).2.       The Future Legislation Committee have agreed that the programme for the remainder of the Session was overloaded, partly because of delays in bringing forward Bills as promised for the beginning of the Session andpartly because it had become necessary to add other Bills to the programme and that if Parliament is to rise as planned by the end of July some Billsmust be deferred to next Session,     The Committee!s proposals are setout below.Additional Bills3,       Since the Cabinet approved the programme (C(67) 96) in June(CC(67) 39th Conclusions, Minute 5) events have necessitated the additionof Bills not then foreseen, mainly for economic purposes^     The committee agreed that a shortened version of the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill,which in July the Cabinet relegated to the Reserve List, should be passed this Session to enable the Government to exempt from the restrictive trade Practices Act agreements which will benefit the economy by improving efficiency and productivity in industry.     They also notedthat it might be necessary to add an Imr.:iigration Bill if the threatenedinflux of Asian holders of United Kingdom passports materialises;  andpossibly a second Air Corporations Bill if the Bill to implement theGovernments undertaking to enable British European Airways to operate in a fully commercial manner is not ready when it is necessary to increaseBEA&apos;s borrowing powers,    In addition, since the Committee met it has emerged that as a result of the post-devaluation measures a miscellaneous provisions Bill will be necessary;  and a further Family Allowances Billmay possibly be needed if it is decided to increase family allowances later in the year to protect poorer families against rising prices.    I am convinced that it would not be wiae, particularly in this year, to try to tack such a provision on to the Finance Bill,    Other urgent require-ments for legislation may arise during the remainder of the Session andwe must have room to meet them.
Deferment of Bills4,       Sonie Bills included in the original programme will not now be needed.     These, and the state of the remainder of the programme, are indicated in the Annex,that the following Bills be deferred until the next Session:The Future Legislation Committee recommendPost OfficeVehicle RegistrationLondon TransportMines and Quarries(Amendment)Law Reform (miscellaneous provisions) II(To establish the new Corporation to run the postal services) - the PostmasterGeneral has agreed to this and to thenecessary deferment of the vesting date for the Corporation.(To set up a centralised system of registration under the Minister of Trans-port).(To reorganise London Transport and traffic management) - Transport holding company (see Annex) to be regarded assubstituted for this.(To implement such of the recommendationsof the Aberfan Report as require legislation).(Rights of illegitimate children and age of majority).With the exception of London Transport and Law Reform (miscellaneous provisions) II, these Bills were mentioned in The Queen&apos;s Speech.Second Reading Committee5.The Future Legislation Committee further recommend that thefollowing Bills due to be taken on the floor of the House (none of whichwas mentioned in The Queen&apos;s Speech) should be taken instead under theSecond Reading Committee procedure:HovercraftNational TheatreBaltic Claims(Required to establish the legal status ofair-cushion vehicles and to enable the Boardof Trade to make safety and otherregulations).     The President of the Boardof Trade has offered to take this by theSecond Reading Committee procedure,(To remove the limit of  1 million on government contributions to the costof the theatre).(To give effect to an agreement reached with the USSR on claims made by both governments arising out of the incorporation of the Baltic States into the USSR).
The Committee also recommend that, v/hilst Immunities and Privilegesshould be drafted in case there were spare time available later in the session, it should be replaced, if there were not, by a shortenedEuropean Coal and Steel Community (Amendment) Bill which would preserve the essential part of the full Bill - the amendment of theECSC Act to take account of the change of the status of the ECSCdelegation in -Condon - and which would be taken under the SecondReading Committee procedure. -6.       Since we can expect to obtain only about 15 Bills through theSecond Reading Committee procedure, the Future Legislation committee recommend that those Bills not already introduced should be taken on thebasis of &quot;first come, first served&quot;.Cone lusion7.       I invite the Cabinet to approve the recommendations of the future legislation Committee;(a) That Restrictive Trade Practices be added to the main programme.(b) That Post Office, Vehicle Registration, London Transport, mines and Cuarries (Amendment), and Lav/ Reform (miscellaneous provisions) II be deferred to the next Session.(c) That Hovercraft, National Theatre, Baltic Claims and, if necessary,ECSC (Amendment) be taken under the Second Reading Committeeprocedure.(d) That the Bills not already introduced under that procedure shouldbe taken on the basis of &quot;first come, first served&quot;.R.

Two Bills in the Essential List(Al) Social Services (Northern Ireland) and Opencast Coal and one in theMain Programme (B) Employment Agencies are no longer needed.Further, Industrial Expansion has taken the place of Concorde, aircraft industry (Finance) from the Main Programme (B) and Beagle aircraft from the Essential List (Al).    But Anti-dumping has taken the place ofEmployment Agencies;  and Education (to deal with the consequences ofthe Enfield case), Revenue (which makes the agreed changes in selective employment payments and export rebates) and Transport holding company (to provide for the acquisition of British Electric Traction in .the current financial year so that the Transport Holding Company can take immediate control) have been added to the programme.    In addition,two bills in the Contingent List (A2), are no longer needed. Developmentof Inventions (Amendment) and Computer Services and others may dropout, but the calculation on which the programme is based assumes that only some of the Contingent Bills will be required.6-
