405IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST YTS GOVERNMENT)7r^___,_^ .............       012th February, 1968CABINETIMMIGRATION legislation memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth affairs must record my dissent from the Home Secretary&apos;s proposal toextend immigration control to citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies (C(68) 34).2.       I accept without reservation that this is a most serious problem and I arn anxious to contribute in any way xoossible to its mitigation.    ButI believe the legislation proposed would(i)  be widely condemned as an act of racial discrimination;(ii)  be construed as a breach of faith towards those Asian residentsin Kenya who were accorded as recently as 1963 by a BritishGovernment full United Kingdom citizenship without reserveor condition;(iii) be contrary to international principle and practice;(iv) be unworkable in practice in respect of any Asians refused con-tinued residence in Kenya,3,       These basic considerations are discussed in paragraphs 8, 9,10 and 11 of the Annex to the Home Secretaryrs memorandum,    Theproposal is undesirable because it creates a second-class category of citizens of this country (i0 e0 the United Kingdom and Colonies)who have no right of entry into any part of it.    Since their UnitedKingdom citizenship is the only one that most of them possess, they/ould be left with no legal right of entry into any country at all.    Wcwould in practice, if not in law, be rendering them stateless.    Theproposal lays us open to the charge of breaking faith with many KenyanAsians who, because of actions by past British Governments for theirown purposes, now find themselves possessing citizenship of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies,,     There is a moral issue of fundamental importance here.     The proposal raises difficulties in relation to international agreements by which v/e are bound, and to customaryinternational iaw0     It would undoubtedly come under challenge inter -nationally.     The practical problems it raises are very considerable.I cannot accept the contention in paragraph 10 of the Annex to the HomeSecretary!s memorandum that the onus for preventing theee people from leaving Kenya (the country from which the majority of them would corne)could be placed on the airline companies.     The problem would be muchmore complicated.    Numbers would undoubtedly arrive here having lost
the right to re-enter Kenya, and much odium would attach to us for a refusal to allow airlines to land these people, carrying a UnitedKingdom passport.    I am doubtful whether we could successfullykeep out people in this category in face of the Parliamentary andpublic outcry which would follow,,     The proposal is certain to provokegreat bitterness in many Commonwealth countries.     There would be strong criticism by certain Governments on the score that Her Majesty!sGovernment, motivated by racial prejudice, were openly discriminatingagainst coloured citizens.4.       I believe therefore that the right course is to impoee therestrictions on dependent children and clandestine entry proposedby the Home Seer etary, which I fully support, and bring maximum,pressure to bear on the Kenya Government to control the flow ofAsian emigration to this country.    Reports over the weekend indicategrowing criticism within Kenya of the policies responsible for the emigration.G. M. T.Commonwealth Office, S. W.l.13th February, 19682-
