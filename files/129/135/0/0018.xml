C(68) 18 COPY NO. ^J^/jL11th January, 1968CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE;  POST-DEVALUATION MEASURESPASSENGER TRANSPORT GRANTSMemorandum by the minster of TiansportAt our meeting on 8th January I was invited to circulate amemorandum on how to effect the cuts agreed in my expenditure onpassenger transport grants (CC(68) 3rd Conclusions).2.      I have already accepted that the additional rebate of fuel taxfor buses should be deferred until 1st January, 1969, and this,together with the deferment of certain infrastructure projects agreed for the nationalised industries,, should enable me tc tolerate theproposed limit of  10 million for expenditure in 1968-69.    In 1969-70the requirement to make the additional rebates on fuel tax for busesand to make new bus grants will operate on a statutory basis for thewhole year.    Although I must make the grants for new buses if thoseentitled to them place orders for the new vehicles, it may well be thatthe rate v/ill be a little slower than 1 had envisaged.    But the onlyelement on which exits can effectively be made is on infrastructuregrants for new transport inwstment.    Thus the  20 million would haveto be made up as follows - mAdditional fuel tax rebate new bus grants 6Rural bus grants 0. 4Infrastructure grants 6, 620. 03.      Of the   60 6 million for infrastructure grants the Brixtonextension of the Victoria Line in London, which is already under construction, will absorb  4 million in 1969-70.    There are other large schemes at present under consideration which might qualify for grant, not only in London but in Merseyside (the Mersey RailwayExtension) and Manchester? and something will aL-so be needed forsmaller projects - station car parks and bus stations, for example,I would not be able to accommodate more than a fraction of these underthe agreed limits.Bo A.
