A summary of the Benelux proposals, and also the full text,are attached.2.       These proposals are, to a considerable extent, due to theactivities and exploration that we have been conducting in Europe duringthe post-veto period and are, in this sense, a response to our desireto maintain the momentum towards closer European integration.G.B.For sign Office, S.W.I.24th January, 1968
The Benelux ProposalsA. summary the Benelux proposals involve consultation and action in four ways:-(i)    the European Commission would &quot;be invited tocontinue to examine with countries seekingmembership those questions the examinationof which they did not complete in their&quot;Opinion&quot; of 30 September; 1967;(ii) the member States of the Community would consult the four applicant countries on all questions covered by the Pome and ParisTreaties, whether these questions have beenthe subject of work between the Six or not.Patents and European Company law are given as examples.    It is proposed, that theexisting agreement of 1954 &quot;between Britain andthe E.C.S.C. should be used as the model for consultation under this head;(iii) joint action should be undertaken in fieldsnot covered by the Community Treaties (thecountries participating varying accordingto the project).   Arms development,production and   purchasing;    technologicalco-operation, and aid to developing countries are given as examples;(iv) the Benelux countries have agreed to consult each other before each decisionon &quot;questions of common interest orimportant questions of foreign policy&quot;to try to reach similar positions. examples are European political co-operation,political and economic relations withEast European countries and relationswith developing countries.    No newinstitutions are proposed.    other european countries are now invited tojoin in consultation on these lines.
AIDE MEMOIREb.- Full TextI, Following the deliberations of the Council ofMinisters of the E.E.C. on 19 December, it was agreed to concert together with a view to examining proposals whichcould be made to mitigate the impossibility of arriving at adecision on opening negotiations on the applications for membership of the European Communities from Britain,Ireland, Denmark and Norway.The Benelux states think it right to inform theirpartners in the European Community, the European Commissionand the states which are candidates for membership, of theresult of xheir consultations on this subject.II, Objectives.    The Benelux states, in making their suggestions, are inspired by the following underlying ideas and principles:1) To pursue their action in favour of the constructionof Europe:    this demands, in conformity with the provisionsof the Treaty, the development and enlargement of the european communities:2) To respect,  in what they do, the letter and spiritof the Rome Treaty:3) The desirability of drawing closer the links betweenthe member states of the European Community and the states which have sought accession.In considering the European idea,  it is necessaryto go beyond words and the present state of economic construction in Europe within the Community.    Europe is not limited tothe six states which are united by the provisions of the rome Treaty    Europe must equally pursue its unificationin the sectors which are not yet the subject of Communitydecisions.In the light of the arrangements set out below, the benelux states envisage a positive programme of Europeanconstruction in the economic and political fields.III, Proposals^ in the Economic Sector1)        The Benelux states are determined to participateactively in the programme of   development of the european communities,2, The Benelux states propose the establishment of aconcrete procedure for consultation between the Community andthe member states on the one hand and the states which areare candidates for membership of the Community on the other,this with the object in particular of avoiding an increase inthe differences existing betvireen the Common Market and the candidate states, -  ..Several kinds of action are suggested:/(a)
(a) Continuation of the study undertaken by the Commissionon the difficulties and advantages of accession of the candidate states.      This would involve continuing with these states the examination of the questions which the commission was unable to complete in its &quot;opinion&quot;.    The Council ofMinisters of the Community could charge the Commission with this task, asking it to report regularly to the Council on theconsequences which it draws from this &quot;joint analysis&quot;.    Ifthis suggestion as regards procedure could not &quot;be adopted,it would nevertheless be necessary to undertake this analysisby another method,(b) The establishment of a precise procedure for consultation between the Community, the member states and the candidatestates in order to facilitate the rapprochement, and toavoid the increase in differences, between the systems of the candidates states and those of the Community.    Thisconsultation covers questions which have been settled bothin principle and as regards procedural implementation by the eec, as well as those questions which have so far only been settled in principle within the Community or which havenot yet been tackled in the Community even though they areexplicitly envisaged by the treaties.    By way of example,one can mention the following fields which although theCommunity has begun work on them would nevertheless permit the achievement of agreements covering the candidate states:    Europeanpatents, European company lav/,  and steps in the field of insurance.    As regards procedure,  the Benelux states suggestfollowing (s&apos;inspirer de) the agreement regarding relationsbetween the ECSC and Britain of 21 December. 195U.    Now thatthere is only one Council and one Commission it would be convenient to extend this procedure; which at present is limited to questions of common interest relating to coal and steely to questions of common interest relating to the treaties of Rome and Paris.    If the extention of this agreementcannot be formally approved by a decision of the Council, then it would be necessary to seek another procedure which wouldenable the same objectives to be achieved.(c) The realisation of common action between the european states which desire it in fields which are not covered by the treaties,    This action should cover specific subjects:    thenumber of participants could vary according to the projects.For example:    the development,  production and joint purchaseof military material, co-operation in specific technologicaland scientific fields and aid to the developing countries.IV.   Proposals in the Political field the Benelux states believe that these proposals, aiming ata European &quot;relance&quot; would be incomplete without a strengthening of relations in the field of political unification.The three Benelux states have decided to strengthen their political co-operation and to consult together before any decision,  or the adoption of any attitude,  on questions of common interest and on important questions of foreign policy, witha view to reaching similar positions.    This consultationwill take place with due respect to obligations undertaken,particularly under the Treaties of Washington, Paris and rome and will cover among other things the following subjects:    European political co-operation,relations with the countries of Eastern Europe in thepolitical and economic fields, and relations with the/d eveloping
countries.Without wishing for the moment to create a newinstitution, the Benelux countries have decided to perfecttheir arrangements for consultation with a view to harmonizingtheir positions.    They hope that other European states willassociate themselves with their experiment and will thus givea further proof of their will to achieve European politicalunification.The Benelux states are at the disposal of their partners in the Community, the European Commission and the candidate states, to reply to questions which these proposals,necessarily outline proposals, may raise and to examine thesequestions in depth.C0NFIDIMT1AL
