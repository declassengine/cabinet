;3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST YJS GOVERNMENT)C(68) 2011th January, 1968COPY NO.5CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE: POST-DEVALUATION MEASURESIMPLICATIONS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for Economic affairs and the Minister of Public Building and WorksAs requested by the Cabinet at their meeting on 9th January, wesummarise in this paper the implications for the construction industryin the next two years of the total programme of public expendituresavings proposed by the Chancellor.    Our concern is that our colleagues should have a quick assessment of this kind before them in reachingfinal decisions.Summary of conclusions,       The total increase in demand for new work in 1968 over 1967which v/as estimated last December to amount to about 5 per cent will now be reduced to about 3 per cent, a figure below the long-establishedannual increase in productivity in the construction industry.    For 1969^the corresponding figures are about 5. 5 per cent and 2 per cent.    Thesefigures are less reassuring than they may seem, for output will go onrising during the next six months until the cuts begin to take effect,&quot;When they do there is likely to be a relatively steep decline in output.This would lead during next autumn and winter either to a marked loss to the labour force or to a sharp fall in productivity.3.       The main implications are as follows:(a)In recent years the industry has achieved an improvement in productivity (output per worker) of about 4 per cent perannum.    This rate was exceeded in 1967, due to exceptionaleconomies in the use of labour.    The increase in demandpreviously expected was thought to be manageable, althoughlikely to lead to some shortages of craftsmen in 1969,particularly in the Midlands and South East, with somepressure on costs and prices.    The smaller increases nowin prospect will either reduce the productivity gainsubstantially or result in the emergence of some sparecapacity, lower employment levels, and the loss of somelabour.
(b) The existing shortage of work for many architects and otherconsultants will be accentuated,(c) Some capital equipment is likely to be under-employed,particularly in the road construction industry, which iscapital intensive, highly mechanised and specialised.(d) There would also be effects on the construction materialsindustry, general confidence, and no doubt an increased flow of bankruptcies, especially among contractors.4.      All forecasts of the load on the industry are subject to a gooddeal of uncertainty.    At the present time it is far from clear what thenet effect of the various influences arising from devaluation and the associated measures will be.    Moreover, however energetically the cuts in public programmes, as finally agreed, are implemented, the timing of their impact on demand for construction cannot precisely before seen.    Nor is it possible to estimate how the revised programmeswill affect different regions and areas of the country.    Nevertheless wemust recognise that the economies will constitute a blow to the industry which is unavoidable if the proposed cuts in public expenditure are to beachieved.    Second, we should ensure that planning and design workcontinues, so that the revised programmes are implemented asefficiently as possible.   Finally, we should keep under review theemployment prospects for next winter^ since if we later decide thatsome extra work needs to be brought forward to keep hard-coreunemployment in particular areas down to an acceptable level, the preparations, even for minor works and maintenance, cannot be left tothe last moment.The Forward Load on the industry.      The main estimates on which the above assessment Is based are asfollows.    The official Group on the Construction Industries recentlyprepared a forecast of supply and demand in the construction industriesup to 1970 taking into account so far as possible the effects of devaluationbut without allowing for any reductions in public expenditure programmes.Thus the forecast covered the additional demand for capital investmentassociated with the expansion of export industries and attempted to assess the uncertain effects of the devaluation measures on private housing demands and on private miscellaneous building (shops, offices,etc. ).    The provisional conclusion was that demand for new work mightri9e in 1968 by about 5. 3 per cent in total over 1967, i. e. from 2, 535 million to  2,670 million.    A slightly bigger increase, of5. 5 per cent, was forecast for 1969 over 1968.     1,485 million of workin 1968 was in the public sector.    (All these figures are at 1958prices).    Within the totals, there was a continuing sizeable increase inthe public sector (housing and non-housing), a much smaller increasein private housing, and a pick-up in 1969, after little change in 1968, in private non-housing work (see Table 1 attached).6,       We have attempted a quick assessment of the constructionelement in the cuts in public expenditure programmes proposed in theChancellor^ paper C(68) 5.    Table 2 attached estimates the reductions in the forecast increases in expenditure on all fixed assets.    We havemade a broad estimate of the proportion (a large one) of construction
SECRET ^        209work in the proposed cuts, also adjusted to 1958 prices and to a calendar year basis to compare with the previous construction estimates.    Theresult is a reduction of  55 million in 1968 and  145 million in 1969.There would be further effects in 19704    This means that the total increase in demand in 1968 would be reduced from 5i 3 per cent to3. 2 per cent and in 1969 from 5. 5 per cent to 2.1 per cent.    (see table 1, last line).7. Our colleagues may also like to see how public and private sector housing starts would look, as we understand it, before andafter the cuts:  see Table 3 attached.,P.S.R.
