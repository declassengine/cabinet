his DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT):(68) 14 COPY NO.11th January. 1968CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE;  POST-DEVALUATION MEASURESPRESCRIPTION CHARGESNote by the Minister of HealthMy view about the proposals to reintroduce prescription chargesremains unchanged.    I now attach a memorandum which has beendiscussed with the Treasury and Ministry of Social Security setting out the problems arising from examination of each cf the various classessuggested by my colleagues.    If the Cabinet insist on restoring thecharges they will no doubt wish me to elaborate orally on these problems;and my colleagues will, of course, give their own views, also.K.R.Ministry of Health, S.E.1.11th January, 1968
PRESCRIPTION charges the prescription charge of 2s0 6d0 per item might produce a totalExchequer saving of about  55 million if paid without exception.,    If thosewho were formerly relieved of the charge (i, e. those receiving supplemen-tary benefit, those whose incomes would be reduced below supplementary benefit level, and war pensioners - for their accepted disability) were excluded, this would reduce the saving to about  50 million.2e       Other classes who might be excused the charge, and the very rough reduction in the saving which would follow, are:-  million(a) The elderly 12-14(b) Children under 16 0(c) Chronic sick (other than the elderly) 2-5 (accordingto definition)(d) Expectant and nursing mothers3.       The problem in each case is to identify those entitled to theexception or refund.     This would be easiest in the case of the elderlybecause their names have already been segregated by the executive councils for the purpose of paying a higher capitation fee to doctorsfor those over 65,     This would reduce the saving by about  12 million,,The best course would be for the medical card to be endorsed and for the doctor, v/hen it was produced to him, to issue a prescription on a colouredform which would include a certificate above his signature saying that hehad seen an endorsed medical card.     There would be some addition to staff of Executive Councils to handle this work,4a       An alternative scheme, which would reduce the need for extrastaff, would provide for exemption for all over 65 and women over 60if they were drawing retirement pensions.     The procedure would be forthe doctor to issue the special prescription form if he had seen either anold age pension book or an endorsed medical card0    The reduction insaving might then be about  14 million,    The objection to this course is that most widows over 60 but under 65 continue with their (earningsfree) widowfs pension in preference to a retirement pension (subject to earnings).    Extension of the field of entitlement to widow pensioners assuch (over 500,000) would be a large extension of the field into the younger age groups and would repercuss on other forms of widowbeneficiary, whereas it is probably the elderly (over 65) who will include a considerable number of chronic sick, who would sufferthe most hardship from paying the charges,5.       Children under 16 present considerable problems because it is not solely a matter of identifying them in the first place but of withdrawing their entitlement when they pass the school-leaving age0(If the proposal was to enlarge the exemption to all remaining underfull-time education the difficulties would become much greater)^Again it would be necessary to identify those children by referenceto their medical cards and the staff required to segregate and endorse
the cards in the first place would be very considerable indeed:  this classcomprises about 25 per cent of all patients.     It would be necessary toarrange for their exemption right to be renewed periodically because there would be no other way of ensuring withdrawal of the cards after they had passed the age of 16.     The reduction in saving would be about 10 million but this considerable widening of the area of exemption v/ould be bound to involve many loopholes and the loss of expected revenue fromabuse v/ould be likely to be even greater.    In addition the cost of the largenumber of extra staff needed in Executive Councils might well exceed 1 million,,6,       Children would suffer, if there were no exemption, less thanthe elderly because the cost would be borne by their parents and if the parents were on the supplementary benefit level they would already be exempt.    However, not to exempt children would bear hardly uponfamilies above supplementary benefit level, but earning below average earnings, and would mean that poor families including those belowsupplementary benefit levels but disqualified because their father isin full-time work could only qualify through a means test^ which wouldbe a disproportionate adminstrative effort in relation to the sums involved.    Moreover this v/ould depend on application and anything approaching an adequate take-up is unlikely.    It is for consideration whether doctors could not operate exemptions on production (if necessary)cf a birth certificate,,     This should only be necessary in the case of olderchildren.7.       The chronic sick present great difficulties because it is notpossible to produce a reasonable definition of who should be includedin the exemption or to identify them.     Some require regular drugs thoughable to undertake full-time work (e0g0 diabetics).     Others requiringregular drugs are handicapped and net in full-time work;   still otherswill only be periodically classifiable as chronic sick by any sort of definition.    The medical profession have already volunteered to us that they would not be prepared to operate a scheme for exemptionbased on clinical judgment.    To prepare a list of ailments as a definition of chronic sickness v/ould be unfair to others whose illness, thoughintermittent, might lead to hardship.     To try to identify them by referenceto length of time off work would be unfair to, e. g0 the housewife.a    Theonly way of bringing in all the chronic sick v/ould be some form of exemption by the doctor, on the basis of his own records of treatmentover a minimum defined period in the past, if this proved practicable,,8.       It does not seem possible to devise any way of relieving the chronic sick as such,    Many of the chronic sick are already gettingsupplementary benefits and v/ill automatically be able to obtain refundswithout difficulty 0    A good many more v/ould also benefit if the elderlywere exempted from the charges,,9.       -Expectant mothers.    Few drugs are normally required byexpectant mothers by virtue of their condition and there would seemtc be no real hardship in expecting them to pay the full prescriptioncharge unless they were otherwise exempt.    However, expectant mothers are already exempt from the charge for dental treatment and the exemption, which v/ould seem to present no difficult?/ for doctors, might be justified in the light of this and other specialbenefits conferred in the interest of the unborn child.
100 Exemption arrangements involve the co-operation of the medical profession in varying degrees and it would be wrong to assume that this connection-operation would be forthcoming,,    We should be in a much stronger position for negotiating with the medical profession the operation of exemption schemes if we could do this before any announcement so thatwe could let them think that the change of policy was dependent upon theschemes.     This obviously cannot be done but if we are to have any chanceat all of negotiating arrangements with, them my announcement would haveto be limited to saying that we intend to restore prescription charges witha repayment to those who received repayment under the formerarrangements, but that we Intend to hold discussions with the medical profession and others concerned to see whether we can arrange to widen the classes to include whatever other classes we decide upon and toprovide for exemption where possible rather than repayment.    Suchan amended scheme could not begin for some little while after theintroduction of prescription charges.
