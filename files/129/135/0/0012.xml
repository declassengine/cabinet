THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(68) 128th January, 1968CABINETRACE RELATIONS LE&apos;.GISLATIONMemorandum by the First Secretary of state the Cabinet invited me on 21st December(CC(67) 74th Conclusions, Minute 2) to arrange for the Home AffairsCommittee to give further consideration to the Home Secretary&apos;sproposals for legislation on race relations, with particular referenceto the application of the proposed Bill to the sale of owner-occupiedhouses.2.     The Home Affairs Committee have considered the proposals intheir present form.    They reaffirmed their previous agreement that legislation was necessary to extend the scope of the Race Relations Actwith the object not only of protecting immigrants against discrimination,but of educating public opinion and giving the support of the law to themajority of law abiding citizens who would be prepared to follow a firmlead from the Government in promoting toleration.    The committee considered, in particular, the sale of owner-occupied houses, theapplication of the Bill to the Crown, the Armed Forces and the police,and the legal machinery for applying sanctions.Sale of owner-occupied houses3.      The Committee recognised that the application of the Bill to thesale of owner-occupied houses raises a number of difficulties.     This isa highly sensitive area; but it will remain so whether the Bill is appliedto it or not.    From the point of view of the immigrant communityhousing is where discrimination hurts most.    Nearly 5 0 per cent ofhouses in England and &quot;Wales are in the hands of owner-occupiers,and what we do here will be regarded as a touchstone of the Government^sincerity.    The whole philosophy of the Bill and its educative effect would be greatly weakened if the owner-occupier were excluded.4.      The Committee consider, therefore, that the Bill should applyto the sale of owner-occupied houses., but that the Home secretary should give informal guidance to the Race Relations Board (RRB) toensure that in the conciliation work of the local committees and of theBoard itself reasonable latitude is given to the exercise of legitimatediscretion by the vendor and that legal proceedings are not taken unless there is such strong evidence of open and flagrant discrimination on grounds of racial prejudice that a court would have little difficulty in finding in the Board&apos;s favour.    It would also be necessary that in the 5COPY NO.
Second Reading debate on the Bill the Home Secretary should be able toexplain in detail how the machinery would work in relation to owner -occupied houses in order to prevent the exploitation by the opposition of fears that any owner-occupier who sells his house to a white man in preference to a coloured will be in danger of being publicly pilloriedand mulcted in damages.5.     We think that, subject to these safeguards, the application of theBill to owner-occupied houses will not prevent an owner-occupier fromselling to a white man notwithstanding that he has received an equal orbetter offer from a coloured man, provided that he has plainly not beenactuated by racial prejudice.    For example, he should be free to sellto a white man on grounds of friendship or personal preference and totake into account his obligation to his neighbours to prevent the housebeing used in a manner detrimental to them, for example for multi-occupation.    We were informed that it is not uncommon in Scotland tomake a condition of sale that the house shall be occupied only by the purchaser and his family.    Restrictive covenants with a similarpurpose, though rare in England and Wales, are not impossible ^ andwe do not think that the imposition of such a condition should in itself be regarded as racial discrimination.6.      The Committee were informed that while the procedure had notbeen worked out in detail the intention wculd be that if a complaint weremade of refusal to sell on grounds of racial prejudice the local concilia-tion committee would invite the comments ot the vendoreither inwriting or by interview, and if satisfied that he had legitimate reasonsfor his choice of purchaser and wa*? not actuated by prejudice theywould explain to the complainant that no discrimination was involved.If the complainant were not satisfied, the RRB would similarlyinvestigate and would not take legal proceedings unless satisfied thatthe case was one of flagrant discrimination.    Unless and until legal action were taken there would be no proceedings in public.7.      The Committee also considered whether in a flagrant case inwhich a court found discrimination proved the sanctions available to itwould be adeq\:ate.     The court will have power to order the defendantto pay damages to the complainant on whose behalf proceedings are taken in respect not merely of actual out-of-pocket expenses (as originally proposed), but of any provable loss resulting from the act of discrimination.    This could, for example, enable damages to be awarded in respect of a job which the immigrant had been uiiaMe. totake because he could not get accommodation locally.     In addition thecourt could order the defendant to pay the costs of the action.     TheCommittee recognised that these were unlikely to be large sums, andthat the complainant who could prove no identifiable loss would not receive any tangible recompense.    But the purpose of the Bill is not primarily either to inflict penalties or to provide monetary compensa-tion for sufferers from acts of discrimination!  its main purpose is to foster a climate of opinion and, on balance, we think that, provided inflagrant cases the law can be vindicated, it is better that the courtsshould not have power to inflict what could be regarded as DraconianpenaKiec,    Where a course of discriminatory conduct has been provedS EC RET
the court will have power to issue an injunction to restrain the defendant from such conduct in the future, and disregard of such an injunction would be subject to the penalties of contempt of court.But while this could apply to a person dealing regularly in property fit would not apply to a single sale by an owner-occupier.8.      The Committee accordingly recommend by a majority that theBill should apply to the sale of a house by an owner-occupier.Application to the Crown9.      The Committee found that the arguments in applying theprovisions of the Bill to the Crown were evenly balanced.    The HomeSecretary proposes that the Bill should bind the Crown as employer,landlord or provider of public services, with the exemptions necessaryto preserve the rules as to nationality and length of residence for entry to the Civil Service and the Diplomatic Service and to protect theCrown[s discretion where security is involved.    Special arrangements would have to be made foi the RRB to investigate allegations againstthe Crown.    The Crown should not be subject to legal proceedings(the Crown cannot in any event be bound by an injunction); but it wouldbe open to the RRB t&amp; draw cases of discrimination to the attention ofthe Minister concerned and, if not satisfied that appropriate action hadbeen taken, to report the case in their annual report to Parliament.    Itis argued that unless the Bill binds the Crown at least to this extent itwill not be politically acceptable and will not have the necessary impact on public opinion.     Those who take this view attach overriding importanceto the assertion of a universal principle of law to which the government as well as the public at large will be subject,10.    The argument against applying the Bill to the Crown is that,since it is accepted that there must be some exceptions, enactment ofthem in the Bill will be seen to weaken the generality of the principle and the exceptions will in themselves appear to be discriminatory.It is suggested that the impact which the holders of both points of viewwant to produce would therefore be more effective if the Home Secretaryannounced on the Second Reading of the Bill that while there weretechnical difficulties in applying the Bill to the Crown, the Crownnevertheless accepted and would be governed by the principles of theBill and would submit its actions to the scrutiny of the RRB.11.     A particular difficulty of making the Bill binding on the Crownlies in the problem of its application to the Armed Forces which already have their own statutory machinery for dealing with grievances withrights of appeal to the appropriate Service Board, the Minister, or, insome cases, The Queen.    It is argued that it would be inappropriate toprovide separate machinery through the RRB for dealing with grievancesbased on alleged racial discrimination and that the Armed Forces should therefore be excluded from the scope of the Bill, leaving the Secretary ofState for Defence to establish an informal relationship with the RRB.To exclude this area from the scope of the Bill, however, would addsubstantially to the necessary exemptions, and to that extent furtherweaken its impact.     The Home Affairs Committee were not convinced
SECRE1144that there was no room for compromise here; and they asked the HomeSecretary to consult with the Minister of Defence for Administrationwith a view to finding some means, while applying the Bill in principle to the Armed Forces, of ensuring that the existing statutory machineryfor dealing with grievances continued to operate and that the Secretaryof State for Defence was not made formally answerable in respect ofthe operation of this machinery to the RRB.12,     If it is decided in principle that the Bill should apply to theCrown ft will be necessary for further consideration to be given to theposition of the Royal Household and the Royal Duchies, but althoughlegal and constitutional problems may arise here such limited exemptionsas may be required would not have the same effect in weakening theprinciple of the Bill as the total exemption of the Crown,    On balanceand by a small majority the Committee accordingly recommend that theBill should bind the Crown on the lines proposed by the Home Secretary.The Police13.     Police officers occupy an independent position and are notemployees either of the Crown or the Policy -Authority.     The questionhow far the Bill should bind the police does not therefore turn on its application to the Crown.     The Home Secretary proposes that the Billshould apply to the police in all respects except in their operationaldealings with the public.     In this field the existing statutory procedure should apply.     This provides for the investigation of complaints againstthe police and for the punishment of police officers found guilty either of criminal or of disciplinary offences.     It is consequently both more appropriate and more effective than the machinery of the Race relations bill, which will provide for no direct punishment of persons proved tohave committed acts of discrimination.14.     The argument to the contrary is that, as with housing, thetreatment of immigrants by the police in the execution of their duty isa sensitive area, and that immigrant opinion will not be satisfied thatcomplaints are fairly dealt with by a procedure which does not usuallyresult in investigation by an officer from outside the Force in question.The Committee concluded by a majority that, provided that acts of discrimination were made specific offences under the police disciplinecode, the balance of advantage lay in leaving complaints against thepolice in their operational aspect to be dealt with by the existing statutory machinery.Appointment of assessors to sit with courts hearing proceedingsbrought by the RRB15.     The Home Secretary proposes that proceedings brought by theRRB to establish that an act of discrimination and contravention of theBill ha.s occurred should in England and Wales be brought beforecounty courts specially designated for the purpose sitting with cwoassessors drawn from a panel appointed by the Lord Chancellor,    Itis argued that the presence of assessors, who may be either white orcoloured but will be chosen for their experience of the relevantproblems, is essential to give immigrant communities confidence thatthe court will deal with the case without bias.    But to the extent that
SECRET ^ 1 4 5the assessors are seen to be present to correct a bias against &quot;the immigrant they may be assumed by the white man whose conduct iscomplained of to be exercising an influence on the court prejudicial to himself j and their mere appointment can be said to be a reflectionon the integrity of the judiciary.    It was represented that theappointment of assessors would be particularly difficult to justify inScotland where it is proposed that eases brought by the RRB should be heard by sheriffs whose jurisdication is wider than that of county courts in England and Wales.16.     The Committee appreciated the difficulty of holding the rightbalance in this matter, but agreed by a majority that in the context of a measure designed to create confidence in the ability of thecommunity to condemn racial discrimination it was presentationallyimportant that the party most likely to fear that the machinery of thecourt would be biassed should have the reassurance provided byassessors.    It was agreed that if assessors were to be appointed inErigtaad and Wales they must also be appointed by the Lord Advocate inScotland.Conclusions17.     The Home Affairs Committee were divided on several of the major issues that arise on the proposed Race Relations Bill.    Thearguments are fairly evenly balanced, and the Committee reached its conclusions by a majority.     The importance attribxited to the various considerations depends largely on how much weight is to be given tothe need to give a striking public demonstration of the governments determination to condemn racial prejudice and to reassure immigrantcommunities that the machinery which applies the ultimate sa.nction isnot biassed against them.     The Home Affairs Committee attach highimportance to the demonstration of principle ana to the impact which theBill might be expected to have on public opinion,18.     i therefore invite the Cabinet to agree -(a) that the Bill should apply to the sale of owner-occupied houses;(b) that the Bill should bind the Crown, subject to necessaryexemptions on recruitment to the Civil and DiplomaticServices and to exemption from legal proceedings;(c) that the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for defence should consult further with a view to finding means of applying the Bill to the Armed Forces without prejudice to theoperation of the existing statutory machinery for dealing withgrievances;(d) that the Bill should apply to the police except in theiroperational capacity;(e) that assessors should be appointed to sit with county court judges in England and Waxes and corresponding courts inScotland.M.S.7 0, Whitehall, S.
