fWIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF KER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT)C(68) 63rd January, 1968COPY NO.   yCABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE;  POST*DEVAUIATION MEASURES1968-69 ESTIMATESNo^e by the &quot;Chancellor of the exchequer am circulating this note for information, as invited by theCabinet on 20th December, when some questions were raised aboutthe 1968-69 Estimates of Supply expenditure (CC(67) 73rd Conclusions,Minute 2).Reasons for the increase in the Supply Estimates2.       The draft Estimates for 1968-69 show an increase of more than 1,100 million, or nearly 12 per cent in money terms, over the budget estimates for 1967-68, or roughly 9 per cent at constant prices.Excluding SET, REP and investment grants these figures becomeabout 107 and l\ per cent respectively,,     They make virtually no provisionfor additional expenditure arising from devaluation.3.       Apart from investment grants (paragraph 5 below) the majorincreases are:-I		  million(i)	Roads and transport	88(ii)	Health and welfare	74(iii)	Non-specific grants to local authorities	177(iv)	Technology	62(v)	Agricultural support	49(vi)	Family allowances	120(vii)	Social security benefits	654.	The main reasons for these increases are as follows:-	(i) and (ii)    The increases for roads and transport and health and welfare are in line with the planned growth of these programmesunder current expenditure policies;  the pattern of expenditure in1968-69 for these programmes was implied when the cabinet endorsed the pattern of public expenditure in 1970-71 on 20th July,1967 (CC(67) 50th Conclusions, Minute 3).
(iii) The very big rise in non-specific grants to local authorities is theresult of increasing expenditure on education and other services,and higher pay and prices.(iv) The technology figure is largely due to increased support for theaircraft industry including Concorde.(v)  The cost of agricultural support is affected by the level of produc-tion and variations in market prices.(vi)  Provision for family allowances goes up because of the increasegiven in October, 1967, and those planned for April, 1968.    these were approved by the Cabinet on 18th July, 1967 (CC(67) 49thConclusions, Minute 2).(vii)   The increase in social security benefits is the effect upon supply expenditure of a full year&apos;s payment of the general uprating ofall social security benefits which took place in October, 1967(as agreed bv Cabinet on 15th June, 1967:  CC(67) 39th Conclusions,Minute 4),5.      A further  234 million of the increase between the two years is dueto the expected rise in investment grant payments, from  166 million in theoriginal Estimates for 1967-68 to  400 million in 1968-69.Estimates compared with outturn6,       It is sometimes said that the published Estimates total ought to be discounted on the grounds that the total Supply outturn for the year as awhole is likely to be lower than the Estimates.    This has not in generalbeen past experience.    The table in the Annex compares the budget estimates with outturn over each of the past 10 years.     Over the whole period outturn has on the average been 0.4 per cent higher than theEstimate.    The outturn has exceeded the Estimate total in seven outof the ten years.    The biggest overspend was  181 million or 3. 5 percent.    The biggest shortfall was  139 million or 2. 3 per cent,    In thecurrent year present indications are that the outturn will be very-substantially above the Estimate.Relationship of Supply to total public expenditure.       Although Supply expenditure shows this large increase, total public expenditure in 1968-69 is not forecast to rise quite so fast -between 6 and 7 per cent at constant prices, or some 9 to 10 per centin money terms.    To understand the reason for the difference it isnecessary to consider the relationship between Supply and total public expenditure.8.      Supply expenditure represents the total of the cash expenditureof Government Departments which has to be voted annually by parliament in the Estimates.   It does not represent all central government expenditure, because it excludes payments direct from the consolidate fund and extra-.Exchequer payments, of which by far the mootsignificant are the outgoings of the National Insurance Funds.At the same time it includes some  2, 500 million of payments from one part of the public sector to another, the largest item
being grants to local authorities.    Because total public expenditure coversall expenditure by local authorities, regardless of how it is financed,grants of this kind have to be netted out in computing total public expenditure.9.       Supply expenditure is therefore by no means co-terminous withtotal public expenditure, and there is no reason why the two should move in a precisely similar way.    Any fast-rising block of expenditure - andin 1968-69 investment grants are a good example of this - which failswholly within Supply will necessarily have a greater effect upon theincrease in total Supply expenditure than on the increase in total public expenditure.R a H.
