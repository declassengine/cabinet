(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER. BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS GOVERNMENT)C(68) 16 COPY NO.llfch January, 1968CABINETV5PUBLIC EXPENDITURE; POST-DEVALUATION MEASURESFOREIGN EXCHANGE COSTS OF BRITISH FORCESIN germany memorandum by the Minister of State for Foreign AffairsThe current tripartite offset arrangements expire at the end ofthis financial year.    They are sximmarised at Annex A.    It was largely owing to American intervention that we succeeded at the la.stminute in making this agreement, which enabled us to claim that wehad covered the greater part of this yearhs foreign exchange costs(about  69 million out of  80 million, or 85 per centh    The Germanshare was  49 million (60 per cent);  the American  20 million(25 per cent).    We recognised, however, that a substantial proportionof both German and American payments represented foreign exchangethat we could expect to earn in any case, so that the value of theagreement was to this extent presentational rather than real.    At thesame time we obtained agreement for the withdrawal of one brigade group and one RAF squadron from Germany, which is now in progress.2.       Because of the great difficulties we had in negotiating the lastagreement, because of the unrealistic elements in it, and because wecould not expect the same help again from the Americans, the defence and Oversea Policy Committee agreed on 20th July, 1967 that we shouldexplore a new approach to the offset problem for future years.    this/ould consist primarily in the negotiation of a long-term agreementwith the Federal German Republic for collaboration on militaryresearch, development and production.    We hoped that such anagreement would bring major offset benefits in the long run,especially from aircraft projects, and that this might enable us in due course to dispense with traditional offset accounting and the recurringfriction caused by difficult annual negotiations.    This idea was put tothe Germans in general terms in August and again in more detail inOctober and was welcomed by them;  but at their talks in London inOctober;, the Prime Minister accepted Dr. KiesingerTs explanation that,owing to their problems with their defence budget, the German side would not be ready for negotiations until the New Year.    Dr. Kiesingerrecognised the need for a satisfactory offset arrangement for the coming year and thought that this could still be concluded before expiry of thecurrent agreement on 31st March.
3.       A meeting between British and German experts on 20th november and the Defence Secretary^ conversation with the German defence minister at Brussels in December have since shown that there is no prospect that a long-term collaborative agreement with the germans could bring offset benefits in the next financial year.    This is becausethe German Government has felt obliged to delay decisions aboutjoining in major projects which might have figured in the agreement,notably the Anglo-French Jaguar aircraft, which would have been the corner-stone of the agreement for purposes of early offset benefits.Nevertheless, the Germans are still interested, and the idea of a long-term collaborative agreement remains clearly well worth pursuing,both for its potential offset benefits and in the context of our Europeanpolicy.    It still holds out the best prospect of enabling us to dispensein the long run with traditional offset accounting.4.       But such an agreement has no relevanca to me immediate problem of tiding ourselves over the next financial year^    the supplementary statement on Defence Policy of 18th July stated that &quot;it remains essential to our balance of jpayments to find satisfactory arrangements to meet these costs [i. e. ihe foreign exchange costs ofBritish forces in German^/ in future, either by offset purchases or byother means&quot;.    Devaluation has since reinforced the urgency of theproblem.    Instead of an overall reduction of costs by  5 million, whichwe hoped to achieve by means of the current redeployment, rising costs and the effect of devaluation now face us with an estimated tctalfor 1968-69 of about  90 million in foreign exchange.5.       We must expect the Germans to continue to refuse to provide any form of offset which would constitute a direct charge on the FederalBudget, such as paying for part of BAOR&apos;s local labour costs.    the continuing elements in a new agreement would therefore be:(a) Direct defence sales to Germany, which ma^ amount next yearto abour  15 million (as against  18. 9 million this year);(b) Civil public purchases, for which it may be possible to negotiatethe same target as this year, i. e. about  26 million afterdevaluation.    These consist almost entirely of purchases thatwould be made from v.s in any case, and their offset value is mainly presentational.Since the deposit accounts, from which civil private purchases (whichyielded  8.6 million this year) were promoted, are now virtuallyexhausted, we cannot count on any offset from this source next year.The foreseeable offset from German sources next year will thereforemeet only 45 per cent of our costs (i.e.  41 million out of  90 million)as against 60 per cent of our costs this year (i. e.  49 million out of 81 million).    Of this year^ American contribution of  20 million,we can expect to be able to count again only the earnings from theUnited States air force squadrons transferred from this country toFrance which, after devaluation, will probably be about  8 million.
6.       The situation has been affected also by President JohnsonTsmeasures to defend the dollar.    Mr. Katzenbach has emphasised therenewed American desire to &quot;neutralise&quot; the full foreign exchange cost of their forces in Germany.    They will probably seek to meet their needs, as before, through German purchases of United StatesGovernment bonds.    Mr. Katzenbach has also proposed multilateraldiscussion of this problem in NATO.7.       Until we know more of American intentions, we cannot take afinal view of the advantages of multilateral discussions.    But it seems clear that they could not be concluded in time to affect next yearJsoffset;  and the prospect of such discussions could be used by theGermans to delay a deal with us.    Moreover it would seem that the americans and Germans would be more likely to benefit financiallyfrom multilateral discussions than we should.    Broadly similararguments apply to any idea of new tripartite talks, with the addedfactor that these, although more manageable, would arouse freshresentment among our other NATO Allies.8.       We still have Dr. Kiesinger&apos;s assuiance of his desire to make asatisfactory new arrangement with us, and the time has clearly come to explore German intentions in formal negotiations to this end.    I believenegotiations should have two objectives.    First, to obtain german agreement to the principle of a long-term collaborative agreement on research, development and production in the defence and possibly alsoin the civil field.      Such an agreement would be a valuable commitment for the future, even if it yielded no offset benefits for the coming year.Second, we should press the Germans to find means of closing the gap between the continuing elements of the current agreement, as outlined in paragraph 5 above, and our prospective foreign exchange costs.Methods worth considering may be?(i)  to teke a lead from the Americans1 book and go for some formof medium or preferably long-term borrowing from theGermans, e.g. by German purchases of British Bonds;(ii)  German agreement to devote a further sum to facilitate majorcivil export sales, e.g, of aircraft.9.       The British Ambassador in Bonn could approach the GermanGovernment immediately to arrange negotiations in Bonn at the beginningof feburary (it will be better not to start negotiations until after theproposed post-veto consultations with the Fi^e in Brussels at the end ofJanuary,    It will be for consideration which Minister should lead our negotiating team,10.       I think the best way to take account of the offset problem whenpresenting the economy measures to the House on 17th january would beto refer to these negotiations, and I annex a form of words which i suggest would serve this purpose (Annex B).F, M.Foreign Office, S.W.I..11th January, 1968
ANNEX AOffsetting Payments 1967/8Most of these are expressed in $ or DM in theagreements.    It is therefore likely that the sterlingequivalent will go up in respect of the period afterdevaluation..      The following table gives (l) thepayments as expressed in the agreements,   (2) thepre-devaluation sterling equivalent, and (3) an indication of what the post-devaluation sterlingequivalent might be in the financial year   ending31 March,  1968.Offsetting Payments - United States(1) (2) (3)(a) Transfer of UnitedStates Air Force  7 million    7 million    7 millionSquadrons(b) Additional United    119 - 6 million    7 million  7-3 millionStates purchases of defence equipment in the UnitedKingdom(c) One-half of addit- $17*5 million  6-J- million  6.6,millionional United States&apos;purchases of def-ence equipment inthe United Kingdomagreed in December1966Offsetting Payments -   German^ Purchases DM 200 million  18 million  18.9 million(b) Civil Public 1Purchases DM 250 million  224   &quot;  23.3 million(c) Other CivilPurchases DM 100 million  8^- million  806 million 69 million  71*7 million
CONFIDENT! ALANNEX BSuggested Norm of Words on Anglo-GermanOffsetAs the House knows,  there have already beeninformal preliminary talks in Bonn about ways and means of &apos; meeting the continuing foreign exchange cost of our forces in Germany after the currentAnglo-German Offset   Agreement expires on 31 March,We are now ready for formal negotiations,  and have proposed to the Federal German Government thatthe talks should start early in February.
