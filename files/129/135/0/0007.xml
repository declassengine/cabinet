DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CM)J7 ^Revise)3rd January, 1968CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  POST-DEVALUATION MEASURESDEFENCE CUTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Secretary of State for Commonwealth AffairsGeneralGiven the present situation, we accept that the Government1 defence expenditure has to be cut, in line with home civil expenditure,if the new economy measures as a v/hole are to be regarded as fair and sufficient,2.       We accept also that the stage has been reached where there canbe no further cuts in defence expenditure unless the overseas commit -rnents on which much of it is based are themselves reduced,    We agreewith the Secretary of State for Defence that to attempt to cut defence expenditure any further without reducing our overseas commitmentsv/ould be to endanger the morale of the armed forces.3,       But after four Defence Reviews, the last of them announced onlysix months ago, the price is heavy.    The cuts we make will inevitablydamage our interests.    We must remember that there is an important and inherent distinction between domestic cuts and overseas cuts.    Civilcuts can be restored once our economic situation is easier;  but ourposition and influence overseas, once lost, will be irretrievable.    we need to weigh the political and economic risks with the greatest care.4.      We are involved overseas in many ways and have bonds with many countries.    These bonds include our moral obligation to respond toAustralia and New Zealand should they be in danger, as they did tous in two world wars;  our obligations to a number of other countries and our international legal responsibility, which we cannot divest our-selves of unilaterally, for our dependent territories.    What is now suggested is not just a reassessment and re interpretation of thoseobligations;  it is a question of breaking our obligations and our pledgedword,    Unilateral action could cause us in the long run economic as wellas political harm, on a scale that v/ould greatly outweigh any economieswe should make, by damaging that confidence in us and our intentionswhich we must sustain.    As a trading nation we cannot afford to have our word and our intentions doubted.    If we are given adequate timefor consultation, we may be able to achieve the necessary changeswe seek and set some limit to the damage.    But we must remind our colleagues that British economic interests are closely involved in the
SECRET Ivwareas from which withdrawals are proposed.    These interests can sufferin two ways.    First, precipitate withdrawal can occasion instabilityleading to revolution or political realignment in which British investmentsare lost and trading opportunities seriously diminished.    Second, we mustbeware lest die world is led to conclude that if we are forced to such measures as the breaking of agreements reached only six months ago and reaffirmed in Parliament as recently as November, our positionsince devaluation must indeed have become desperate.    There is a real danger they will feel that in fact this time Britain must beyondall question and at last be finished.    If that belief ever became generalthe consequences politically, economically, and for the position of sterling, would be exceedingly grave.    The consequences of the actionnow proposed could therefore prove to have a cost to our balance ofpayments far outweighing the savings which these measures could produce,5,       We and our officials have taken a long hard look at all our commitments, worldwide.    This is what we have found.Europe6,       NATO is the core of our security, and any unilateral breach of our undertakings could have the gravest consequences, both for our political aims in Europe and for our national security.    To make reducetions without agreement with our allies would risk a general reactionand the unravelling of the Alliance.    Had we attempted to behave in thisway we would not have retained the goodwill as we did so successfullyin our recent negotiations over the re-deployment of a brigade fromBAOR.    But the Alliance will not stand still.    Changes will come.For example, under the new force planning procedure NATO is re-assessing, and will continue on a year to year basis to re-assess, theforce levels it requires.    Quite apart from this it might prove possible to make progress towards mutual East-West reductions.Equally if our Allies refuse to maintain their fair share we would haveto review our position.    Any or all of these could provide an atmosphere for negotiating further reductions, but what we cannot dois to make unilateral reductions on our own.    Meanwhile, we should seek, in conjunction with the United States, to settle the offset question and the numbers of our forces on the Continent with the Germans andother members of the Alliance on a proper long-term basis.    All thiswill take time.    We accept that, if we are to keep Europe as our maincentre of effort, the principal cuts must come from other areas.Malaysia and Singapore7.       Our Far East Defence policy has been under continuous review and adjustment over the last two or three years.    A drastic reappraisalof defence expenditure was made earlier this year and major reductionsannounced as recently as last July.    There was great difficulty in securing the acquiescence of our Commonwealth partners and allies inthese reductions.    Our Commonwealth partners and the United states were strongly opposed to our declaring a date for our final withdrawal and they all pressed for a continued British presence as a guarantee of stability in an area where historically we had a unique contribution tomake.    We were only able to secure their agreement to our proposed reductions by not giving a precise date for our withdrawal but statingthat it would be in the &quot;middle 1970s&quot;; by reaffirming our intentionsto honour our obligations; and by promising a continued military capability for use in the area if required.    We also said we were determined that our reductions would take place in an orderly manner and offered significant aid to assist Malaysia and Singapore in effecting the necessary economic transition as smoothly as possible,-2-SECRET
8.       We recognise that if we are to achieve significant defence savingswe must secure an acceleration of the pattern of the rundov/n in malaysia and Singapore which has so far been agreed.   But given the undertakings which we reaffirmed only last July it. is clear that this can only be achieved at a political price and at the risk of economic retaliation.    The extent ofthis damage will depend crucially on -(a) The date of completion of the rundown.(b) A reassurance of our intention to maintain a continuing generalcapability which could be used in the area if required.(c) Adequate consultation with our Commonwealth partners and alliesbefore a public announcement.9,       We are firmly of the view that the earliest date for the completionof the rundown that would be tolerable -would be 31st March, 1972.    in singapore we shall be throwing on to the labour market something like60,000 people now directly deriving their employment from the british forces, and if for example the rundov/n were to be completed by 31st March,1970, this would lead to an unemployment rate of 26 per cent.    In Malaysiaabout 19,000 persons would be put out of work.    In Singapore, this couldprovoke widespread labour unrest possibly leading to the overthrow ofMr.  Lee Kuan Yew and the assumption of power by a Communist regime.In that event, so far from our being able to achieve an orderly withdrawal,we might have to fight our way out.    In Malaysia the announcement of ourearly withdrawal would give great encouragement to Communist subversionin a country with built-in communal problems.    Moreover if instabilitydeveloped in Singapore, Malaysia might be tempted to intervene with possible further international repercussions.10.       While we accept that there would be no special capability for usein the Far East after our withdrawal it will be important that the generalcapability we retain in Europe should be usable overseas when required.We must be able to assure our Commonwealth partners and allies that inthis way we shall retain a capability to help them if circumstances in ourown judgment demanded it.    This would not be anything special to theFar East but simply an expression of the fact that our strategic reservewould be available to be used anywhere in the world where we thought itin our interests to do so,11,       If the above were agreed we should be quite frank and make clear to the Commonwealth countries in the area and to the Americans the limitations which cur general capability would place on the nature ofany military assistance which we could provide.    In effect we shouldbe telling Singapore and Malaysia that how we help them will have to bedetermined by the circumstances at the time, including the size and shape of the armed forces which we then had.    The Anglo-Malaysian defence agreement has great psychological value in maintaining confidence in thearea.    There is in fact no provision for its termination and for ng toabrogate it unilaterally would create a profound shock.    We 3houldnegotiate wi&amp;t the Malaysian Governments so as to make- it fit the new conditions.
12.     We are glad to know that the Chancellor recognises that theBill for mitigatory aid to Malaysia and Singapore is likely to be higher.Preliminary calculations indicate that - depending on the date by whichthe rundown is completed - the aid requirements of Singapore and malaysia for the three years up to 31st March, 1971 would have to be revised upwards as follows:-A,    Rundown completed by31st March, 1971Singapore  m.70Malaysia m.28B.    Rundewn completed by31st March, 19724325Substantial aid will also be required after 31st March, 1971, of the orderof  40- 5Q million per annum for Singapore and Malaysia together, fora period of several years.    We must be able to tell the Malaysian and singapore Governments, when we disclose our revised timetable, thatwe shall be willing to discuss the aid implications with them.    ministers should accept now that aid commitments of the order of magnitudementioned above will be required.    A request for negotiating instructionswill be submitted later this mo3?.th.Hong Kong13.     Hong Kong will become increasingly isolated and the size of ourgarrison there (7. 2/3rds major units), even allowing for the Hong Kongfinancial contribution, will become more and more out of scale with the overall pattern of our forces.    We are engaged on a study of our policy towards Hong Kong in the longer term but, at the present stage of ourrelations with China, any immediate reduction in the garrison would cause loss of economic and political confidence in Heng Kong, with itsattendant risks.     The Communists appear to have recognised that theycannot attain their ends by violence; but they would probably be encouraged to try again, making it necessary for us to reinfoce thegarrison once more.    Even more, the announcement now of a date for total withdrawal would result in a rapid total collapse of confidence,leading to political, administrative and economic chaos, and with real risk of a grave international crisis.14.     The problems here are parallel to, and closely connected with,Far Eastern problems, except that in the Far East there is no direct and immediate British economic interest comparable to Middle East oil.We have a duty to leave our colleagues in no doubt about the nature of the risks to British interests that are involved here.    40 per cent of Britainrs(and over 50 per cent of Western Europe&apos;s) oil supplies come from theGulf and 40 per cent of Gulf oil is in British ownership and make a significant contribution to our foreign exchange earnings.    Apart fromthe Kuwait commitment our position in the Gulf is indivisible.    Therecan be no half measures.    A phased withdrawal over two years could lead to an Aden-type situation.    An immediate withdrawal would carry-4.
SECAST106with it the certainty- of friction and the probability ef hostilities,particularly between Iran and Saudi-Arabia.    Repercussions over this could put at risk not only our own, but all Western oil interests in thearea.     There would be domestic pressure on the Shah to occupy Bahrain.Resistance to such pressures could destroy the stability of his regime and jeopardise the Western connection.     But if Iran occupied BahrainHer Majesty!s Government could find themselves ranged against her atthe United Nations and generally, and our oil and other interests wouldbe again endangered.    Meanwhile, the Russians would take advantageof the situation (as they are already doing in Iraq, by arranging apolitical purchase of eil they do not economically need).     If their initiative were successful our oil supplies could be ultimately underindirect but effective Russian control.15.     In order to guard as much as possible against the foregoingour action in the Gulf should be;-(a) To give up the Kuwait commitment at a very early date to bedetermined in discussion with the Amir.(b) To withdraw wholly from the Gulf by the same date ae theFar East withdrawal, i. e. 31st March, 1972.Publicity: The Far East and the Gulf16.     The problem is the same we faced last July; but now it is in aheightened form.     Our best chance for a successful consultation withour allies (who will be fearful of the effects of publicity upon stability in South East Asia and the Gulf) would be if we announced on 16th-17thJanuary no more than that eur defence plans are under stringent review;that the decisions published last July have had to be re-examined; thatto produce meaningful savings substantial changes are needed involvingconsultations;  and that these are proceeding urgently.17.     This would keep dov/n to the minimum the risk of doingirreversible political and economic damage to ourselves and othersabroad.    But v/e recognise that to continue to make no announcement of oversea and defence cuts would not be understood at home and could castdoubt on the firmness of our intention to set our economic house in order.18.     In the last resort, therefore, and provided the date of finaldeparture is accepted as 31st March, 1972, we would be willing to put to our Commonwealth partners and allies a form of announcement which made specific reference to this date for the Far East while, because ofthe high stakes and grave risks, preserving secrecy on the Persian Gulfother than Kuwait.The Gulf.    Consultation19.     We shall need to consult the Shah, King Faisal and the Amir of Kuwait in advance of any statement we may make, and we shall also need to reassure the Rulers of the Gulf States.    In the light of the personalassurances given by the Minister of State on his recent visit to the area,and of the post-devaluation messages sent to a number of Governments,we are considering whether a Ministerial visit would be desirable.-5-SECRET
20.     The Foreign Secretary, who leaves London on Saturday,6th January, for a visit to Japan, will return via the United States.He will have consultations with Mr. Rusk, the United States Secretaryof State, in San Francisco on Saturday, 13th January.    He will be backin London bn Monday, 15th January.21. The Commonwealth Secretary has arranged to visit Kuala Lumpur,Singapore, Wellington and Canberra between 5th and 14th January.22.     The purpose of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s visit would be toexplain in general terms the background of the economic reasons for thedecisions, making it clear why there have to be cuts both in the domestic and in the external field.    If this course were approved, he would go ento state that the Government have decided that the rundown in the far east must be accelerated and would inform Cemmonwealth Governmentsef eur intentions, including our readiness to discuss a revised aid programme, our continuing general capability (located in Europe)after withdrawal and our new approach to the Anglo-Malaysian defence agreement.    He would explain that we   envisage our membership efSEATO continuing, on a restricted basis.    He would make it clear thatthe final decision would be taken at a Cabinet meeting on 16th Januarywith a view to an immediate public announcement thereafter, and thathe would be returning for that meeting in order to convey any views which Commonwealth Governments wished to express,23.     We should inform the Thais, Filipinos and Pakistanis (as our partners in SEATO and Pakistani case CENTO also) before theannouncement is made.    We should also inform Canada and our otherNATO partners.Other Areas24.

(b) LibyaWe should try to re-shape our treaty commitment so as toensure a longer warning period.    But if we go back on the commitmentwe should imperil arms orders estimated at up to  250 million over thenext five years and a highly important source of oil supplies West of suez.(c) MaltaWe have a defence agreement v/ith Malta until 1974 and havealready negotiated the fastest possible rundown of British forces there.(d) GibraltarIn the present political climate it would not be possible towithdraw the garrison from Gibraltar, although it cannot be justifiedmilitarily.Other Areas25.     (ii)   ElsewhereA thorough study has been made of all our lesser commitments.These mainly affect our dependent territories.    We are willing todiscuss possible savings with the Chancellor, but these may not be substantial, and do not raise questions of major policy, with the possible exception of discontinuing the Beira patrol.    These commitments includeresponsibility for military protection and evacuation of British nationals in Africa and the Middle East:  the defence and internal security ofMauritius after independence: protection and defence of the falkland islands:  the garrison in British Honduras;  our obligations to Brunei;and Fiji which in the worst case requires a brigade group to be committed.    But we must remember that we are legally and morallyresponsible for the defence of our dependent territories.    This willcontinue to be an essential part of our peacekeeping role in the world and will make it necessary for us to maintain a general capability.Conclusions26.     The effect of cuts on the foregoing scale will be severely todimmish British influence overseas, and their consequences will beunpalatable.    In the worst case we might see a Communist Singapore,and a Persian Gulf whose oil supplies were either in chaos or underRussian control.    The reactions of the United States which were madelast July, will be even stronger, particularly since their problems in vietnam will make it hard for thern to take remedial action else wherein South East Asia;  and, since our own position in the Gulf is unique,they cannot replace us there.    Given our economic situation, heavycuts seem inevitable, and the price is bound to be severe.    But themore successful our consultations, and the smoother the transition,the less damaging the consequences will be.-7-
27.     K our recommendations on oversea policy are accepted we are advised by the Secretary of State for Defence that he could see his wayto making further substantial savings.    Leaving out of account transitional payments the Defence secretary is preliminary, broad estimate is thatbudgetary savings of between  50 million and  80 million should beachieved in 1969-70, thereby reducing the defence budget in that yearto, or a little below, the level achieved in 1968-69 after the  110 milliondevaluation cut had been made, and of about  150 million by 1972-73which would result in a Defence Budget total of about  1650 million in 1972-73 at 1964 prices.28.      Against this background, our recommendations for cuts incommitments are that we should;-(i) decide to withdraw altogether from our bases in Singapore and malaysia by 31st March, 1972, and announce this decision toParliament in the third week of January, 1968.    There wouldhave to be consultations beforehand with our Commonwealthpartners and the United States;(ii) decide to withdraw wholly from the Gulf by the same date asthe Far East withdrawal, i. e. 31st March, 1972, but notannounce this decision;(iii) decide to give up the Kuwait commitment at a very early dateco be decided in discussion with the Amir;(iv) subject to (iii), reduce the number of our aircraft in Cyprus;(v)  reshape our treaty commitment in Libya;We should also:-(vi) examine the possibility of sheddingresponsibility for military protection and evacuationin the Middle East and Africa;the commitment for defence and internal security ofMauritius after independence;the British Honduras garrison;the protection and. defence of the Falkland Islands;our obligations to Brunei;the Beira patrol.we should also:-(vii) examine the scale of our military support for internal security in Fiji.G.
