ISnOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)CI681312nd February, 1968COPY NO.65CABINET1971 CENSUS OF POPULATION; INCLUSION IN 1968&quot; PRE -TEST OF QUESTIONS IN INCOME&quot; and country OF ORIGINMemorandum by the First Secretary of state the Home Affairs Committee have been unable to reach agree -ment on a proposal by the Minister of Health to include questions aboutincome and parents&apos; country of origin in the schedules to be used in thepre-test this April of the 1971 census of population, and, in view of theimportance on the one hand of testing public reaction to these questions and of the possibility on the other that the pre-test would provokepublic criticism, the Committee considered it desirable that thematter should be brought before the Cabinet,2.     The attached memorandum by the Minister of Health, which was before the Home Affairs Ccmrnittee, indicates (in Annexes A and B) thenature of the enquiries which it is proposed to make and sets out thereasons for making them.    The only question now at issue is whether these enquiries should be included, along with ethers normally asked ina census, in the pre-test.3.      The primary purpose of the pre-test is to try out procedures for field staff; a secondary though important purpose to ascertain public reaction to the two new questions, including whether there v/ould beany objection to answering them, and, if so, whether public hostilitywould be sufficiently widespread to have an adverse effect on the response to the 1971 census as a whole if the particular questions were included in it.     Participation in the pre-test will be voluntary, and adecision whether to include the new questions in the census itself willbe taken in the light of the pre-test.    The inclusion of the questions inthe pre-test does not prejudge that decision, but their exclusion from it does, since if these questions are not pre-tested they cannot beincluded in the census itself.The income question4.     A small majority of the Home Affairs Committee considered thatthe question should be included in the pre-test, for the following reasons:-(a)    The information could not be obtained from any other source.The Inland Revenue do not possess it in relation to non-taxpayers or to households or geographical areas, and such information as they have cannot be correlated with othercensus information, for example on education or employment,-1-
(b) It was not clear whether there would in fact be widespreadpublic objection to the question, and the only way of findingthis out was to include it in the pre-test,(c) If the information could be obtained it would be invaluable inrelation to the Governments social and economic policies.(d) The experience of other countries and of other forms of enquirymade in this country suggested that fears of public resentmentmight be exaggerated.5.      The minority of the Committee who took the opposite view did so on the grounds thats-(a) The public were in fact likely to object to being asked to state their income, and in particular to state it through the headof the household, unless they explicitly asked to make aseparate return.(b) The information obtained by the question would in any event be likely to be inaccurate and would not be susceptible   tochecking.(c) To ask the question, even in a pre-test in which participationwas voluntary,, would expose the Government to criticismfor &quot;snooping&quot;.(d) It was likely that the purpose of the enquiry would be mis -understood, and at the present time it was particularlyundesirable in relation to the Governments policy on prices and incomes that there should be any cause for suspicion that they were seeking by some unusual means to obtain information in this field,(e) While there was no compulsion to supply the informationasked in the pre-test, the public would take the point thatif the question were included in the cenaias itself it wouldbe a criminal offence to refuse to answer it.Cc^untrj^jrf ^rj^gin6,      The Committee were divided in the same manner on whether thisquestion should be included in the pre-test and for much the samereasons.    Additional arguments against the inclusion of the question were that the public would interpret it, however phraseds as a question about colour and resent it accordingly, and that in so far as it was infact desired to distinguish immigrants with an Asian or African back-ground from those with a European background the question would fail to do its for example, a statement that the country of origin of a man&apos;sparents was South Africa would be unhelpful.     On the other hand, themajority in favour of the inclusion of the question pointed out that if both this question and that on income were asked the correlation betweenthe answers would provide vital additional information? that information on ethnic origin was important to the development of the Governmentssocial policies, (and to gauging their success) and to that of racial inte-gration in particular; and that some sections of public opinion might consider that the information asked for ought to be available.-2-
372Conclusion7. In the light of these considerations I ask the Cabinet to decide whether a question -should be included in the voluntary pre-test of the census to be con-ducted in April, on the understanding that the question whether similarenquiries should be made in the census itself would be brought before ministers for consideration at a later stage in the light of experienceof the pre-test.    An early decision is essential     the questions are tobe included in the material for the April test.(a)on income \(b)on the country of origin of the respondents parents;M. S.70, Whitehall, S.

3731971 CENSUS OF-POPULATION:    FIRST PRS-TSST - 1968Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of health the Committee have agreed that a census of population should be taken in 1971 and that, as part of the preliminaryplanning, field tests should be conducted during the next two years (H(67)l6th Meeting, Minute 2;    and 25th Meeting,Minute 5)*2.     The first pre-test will be carried out in April 1968,in ten^seTeT^e^ar^as^Tn England and Wales, covering a totalof Lj.0,000 households;    in Scotland a similar test is planned in ten areas with 3,600 households.     The primary objective is to test procedures, including some innovations, for fieldstaffo     In order, however, to carry out these proceduresrealistically, it will be necessary to give householdersa schedule to complete, though this need not resemble at allclosely the form which will be finally adopted for the census itself.     The completion of the form in the pre-testwill be entirely voluntary.3&apos;     Whilst the primary object of the test is proceduralit could, if the Committee approve, be made to serve thefurther important purpose of testing public reaction to theinclusion in the census form of two new subjects, namelyincome and ethnic origin.     Although both are covered by thecensuses in a number of other countries (e.g. United Statesof America and Canada), neither has featured in previouscensuses in this country, but I am satisfied in both cases that there is now a substantial and increasing demand forthem.     Their inclusion is supported by the StatisticalPolicy Committee, to whom the wording of the questions setout in the Annexes hereto is acceptable.k*     The case for an income question has been pressed by theDepartment of Economic Affairs, the &quot;&quot;Department of education and Science, the Central Statistical Office, the Board ofTrade and other Departments, and also by the NationalInstitute for Economic and Social Research and otheracademic and local authority interests.     The main reasonsadvanced in support of it are as follows:-(l) It would provide a more detailed geographicalbreakdown of income distribution than is available from other sources.     This would be of value:
(a) to Government Departments, for whom it v/ouldprovide background information necessary for decisions on the fields of economic development,the social services and the incomes policy;(b) to regional and local planning bodies concernedwith housing and other aspects of land use;(c) to research workers in economic and socialstudies;and (d)  to those sections of the business world engagedin marketing and forecasting demand.(2) Income could be tabulated against the whole range ofdata collected through the census.    Althoughsmaller-scale surveys may collect information on incomes, together with some other social data, only through the census would it be possible, forexample,  to relate income to both occupation and education.(3) It would provide information on household as well asindividual incomes.(h) It might enable other investigations, such as the family Expenditure Survey, to be adjusted for non-response and would thus improve the quality of the data they obtain,5.     I realise that the political implications of an incomequestion may have an impact on the quality of the dataobtained;    public resistance,  or even resentment,  could resultnot only in this particular question&apos;s yielding information of poor quality, but also in a general lowering of the standardof response to the census as a whole.    The resistance could arise from unwillingness to reveal Income to the Government,to the enumerator or to the head of the household, who is responsible for collecting information from the other members(unless they opt to put in personal schedules).    these objections are, however, conjectural and,  in view of the demandfor an income question, it seems desirable to put them to apractical test.    The 1968 pre-test, when there will be nocompulsion to answer,    presents an opportunity to take some measure of public reactions:    refusal to complete the schedulewould itself be a crude measure of resistance and,  in addition,householders will be asked to record any comments they may wishto make.    The intention is to put the income question to approximately fifty per cent of the householders covered bythe pre-test, so that their response to the questionnaire asa whole can be compared with that of the other fifty per cent.6,     The form in which I propose to ask this question in 1968is shown in Annex A.    It is on the same general lines as theform used in the United States and is not necessarily the form which would be adopted in the census itself, if it were decided to include a question on this subject.2.
7,   The proposal to include a question on ethnic originis derived from the vie?/ that integration of the colouredpopulation, including the rapidly increasing numbers of coloured persons born in this country, is now, and will formany years continue to be, a major objective of Governmentpolicyc8a   The success or failure of this policy can only be measured by periodically comparing the position of white and.coloured persons in such matters as housing, employment and education.    The subject will therefore be important not onlyto the Home Office, which has a general responsibility forrace relations as well as for immigration, but also to suchDepartments as the Ministry of Labour and the Housing and education Departments.    The census, I suggest, is theappropriate instrument for presenting a general picture ofthe relative position of coloured people in all these fieldsand for highlighting the areas in which more detailed studies are required.9,   3y providing a tool which will help to measure progressin integrating the immigrant population and theirdescendants.    The census would play a valuable part in determining what might be acceptable rates of immigration infuture years.10. There is a further pressing need for distinguishingimmigrants and their descendants in order to improve thework of the General Register Office in projecting the natural increase of the population.   At present there is whollyinadequate evidence on the question how far immigrantfertility tends to conform with that of the native populationrather than with the much higher levels which obtain in mostof the countries from which they come.119 The form in which I propose to ask the question is setout in Annex 3.12. I am satisfied that unless we can include these newtopics in our 1968 pre-test,  they cannot be included in 1971?because we shall not have sufficient experience of their general effect on response to the Census.    I therefore invitethe^Committee to agree to their inclusion in the pre-test inthe form set out in the Annexes to this paper.K.
