j DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)65C(68) 3030th January.., 1968COPY NO.CABINETFARM PRICE review memorandum by the First Secretary of StateIt has not proved possible for the Ministerial Committee on agricultural Policy to reach agreement on the limits to whichAgricultural Ministers should go in negotiations on this year*s farm price Review.    I set out below the divergent views and my ownrecommendations on the main issues.Background20       Officials have carried out a review of the extent to which the commodity objectives of the existing selective expansion programme for agriculture might need to be modified in tire light of devaluation.Their general conclusion was that, apart from some minor adjustments of individual commodity objectives,, the broad pattern of the programmeremains appropriate.    The review showed, however, considerabledivergences of view between the Treasury and the agricultural departments.    The Treasury emphasised that the continuation of theexpansion programme must be considered in the light of the exchequer cost and other relevant factors, on which information was not thenavailable.    Particularly on the major issue of beef, the Treasurydoubted whether the proposed expansion could be achieved without a disproportionate cost to the Exchequer, and they argued more generallythat the resources needed for agricultural expansion might make an even bigger contribution to the balance of payments if deployed elsewhere.3.      The officials&apos; report was considered by the Economic Advisers.They concluded that -(i)  the level of support for agriculture should be re-examinedbecause^ as a general proposition, devaluation should reducethe level of Exchequer support that can be justified to produce a given import saving in the economy generally?(ii)  there should therefore be a further examination after the farm price Review when additional information will be available on the cost in resources and in Exchequer money of achieving the present expansion objectives?  but-1-
(iii)  we should not decide to make radical changes in the selective expansion programme until we have actually achieved animprovement in the balance of payments, though the emphasisin the present Price Review should be thrown on commoditieswhere the response will be quick and the benefit to the balanceof payments will accrue in the next year or two.4.      Devaluation will mean higher prices for imports and thereforelower deficiency payments to farmers on some commodities.    It isestimated that the resultant saving to the Exchequer will be in the range of  30- 40 million in the full year, though only part of this will be felt in 1968-69.5.      The divergent recommendations by Departments for the presentPrice Review are summarised In the table at Annex I.    Since these recommendations were made, the estimate of cost increases incurred by farmers since the last Review has been increased from  66 million to  68. 5 million (plus some  14 million in feed for pigs and eggproduction whSch will be recouped automatically under the Reviewprocedures) and all Departments accept that their recommended totalawards should be adjusted to take account of this.    The figure forcosts may yet go even higher.Total Size of the Award6.      The Agricultural Departments recommended an award totalling 73 million.    This would meet all the increased costs and leave a margin to the farmers of  7 million.    This sum, together with gainsfrom increased productivity conventionally estimated at  30 million,would represent an addition to total net farm income ( 500 millionapporximately) of l\ per cent).    It has to be remembered that out of net farm income there must be provided a large proportion of finance for new investment as well as the return on past investment and personalincome to the farmer;  so an increase in farmers1 net income is not comparable with a wage increase.    If account is taken of the declinein the number of farms, the increase in net income per farm on thebasis of the Agricultural Departments&apos; recommended award would beabout 8 to      per cent.7.      The Treasury recommended an award of  33 million, equivalentto half the increase in c coats:  the balance of cost increases v/ould mopup all the estimated productivity gains and still leave the farmers to finda further  3 million.8.      The Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) take an intermediate position, recommending an award of  51c5 million.9.      In my view, the Treasury recommendation is too low.    It wouldbe in conflict with the assurance we have given the farmers that theirgains from productivity would be used not only to help to meet rising costs but also to finance further investment and improve the farmers1standard of living.    On the other hand, I cannot accept that in ourpresent economic situation farmers should be reimbursed for the wholeof their increased costs and given additional incentives besides, whichwould be the effect of the recommendation by the agricultural departments.
CiYi   SDENTIAL36310.       I recommend a total award of  53. 5 million,,    This is in line with the DEA recommendation, adjusted for the revised figure of increased costs.    It would leave the farmers to meet  15 millioncost increases from their expected productivity gains.    They v/ouldthus be able to retain half those gains - i. e.  15 million, representingsome 3 per cent of total net farm income,11.       It is not possible to put a precise figure on the extra cost whichwould fall on the Exchequer in the financial year 1968-69 as a result ofsuch an award.    Exchequer costs in 1968-69 are estimated to rise by 18 million, largely as a result of last year&apos;s award, before anyaccount is taken of the present awards    To this must be added thetotal cost of the award ( 53, 5 million), less the value of the individualawards on milk and sugar, which fall on the consumer, not theExchequer ( 13 million on my proposals) - i, e. a net addition of 40, 5 million,, making a total increase of  58. 5 million.    But the call on the Exchequer in 1968^69 would be less than this because someof the actual payments to farmers flowing from the present a.ward willnot be made until 1969&quot;70.    Against this s however, there will be theadditional Exchequer subsidy on any increased production stimulated by the present award.    Taking account of these factors, it is likely that the Exchequer would have to pay out in 1968-69 something like 50 million more than in 1967-68.    But the full saving on support costsaccruing from devaluation effects on market prices will not be feltuntil 1969-70?  the devaluation price effects will reduce the Exchequerbill in a full farm year by some  30-  40 million below what it v/ouldotherwise have been.Beef /Milk12.      It is on the beef/milk complex that there is the sharpestdivergence between Departments.    The position is summarised in annex II.    In considering what I should recommend to my colleagues,I have borne in mind the view of the Economic Advisers (Paragraph 3(iii)above) that we should place the emphasis on commodities which will show the quickest returns to the balance of payments;  this arguesagainst higher incentives for beef, where the production cycle isthree years.    Qn the other hand;, we are committed to providingadequate resources to the livestock sector to meet the needs arisingfrom the foot-and-mouth epidemic! moreover, it would be prematureat this stage to abandon the expansion target for beef, and an awardwhich did not meet the increased costs,, estimated at about 12s. 6d perlive cwt., would in my view put the target at risk.,    I therefore recommend an increase in the guaranteed price of i2s. 6d per cwt.In order to secure the necessary expansion the Agricultural Departmentsargue that we should also give an assurance that the guaranteed pricewill not be reduced at the next two Reviews.    But the Treasury and theDEA argue that such an assurance might involve excessive Exchequercosts in the future.    The considerations are evenly balanced a.nd I ask the Cabinet to resolve this issue.    On milk, I recommend an increaseof l^d in the guaranteed price per gallon?  this will mean that theincrease in the retail price from lOd to 10-fd^ now expected to takeplace in December, 1968, v/ill be brought forward to July.-3-
. OENTIAL364Wheat13.       We are committed to an increase in the guaranteed price for wheat.    Wheat expansion offers the prospect of substantial and rapidsavings of imports.    In my view, a substantial incentive is justifiedand I recommend an increase of Is. 6d in the guaranteed price.Hitherto, expansion of wheat production has been inhibited by ourbilateral commitments to overseas suppliers.    As a result of the kennedy Round, we have now disentangled ourselves from these commitments.    The Agricultural Departments believe that my proposal(or indeed theirs for an increase of Is. 9d) would not cause international difficulties; but the Foreign Office think that, because our commitmentsare still formally in being until next July, the increase in the guaranteed price this year should not go beyond Is. 3d.14.      The Agricultural Departments propose that we should alsoabolish the standard quantity arrangements which govern the amountof v/heat production to which the guarantee relates, on the ground thatthis would give a valuable boost to confidence in the industry.    TheTreasury and theDEA, however, argue that while abolition would costlittle or nothing in the immediate future, it might be very costly in f;helonger term, and that the arrangements showld therefore be retained.The considerations are balanced and I ask my colleagues to resolvethis point.Pigs15,      This again is a commodity where expansion can bring substantialimport saving quickly.    Cost increases are equivalent to an increasein the guara.nt.eed price of 9.15cl a score.    I think an additionalincentive is justified and I recommend an increase of Is.    We haveto watch our relations with Denmark, but we are already below our quotaunder the Bacon Market Sharing Understanding and I do net think my proposal should cause undue difficulty in this respect.Remaining Commodities16.      While there are substantial divergences of view between departments on the remaining elements in the award, these stemlargely from the differences in the recommended total awards.    Givendecisions on the total award and the awards for the major commoditiesdiscussed above, I do not think I need trouble the Cabinet with thedistribution of the balance.    I recommend that this should be worked out by the Agricultural Departments hi consultation with the Treasury,and with the other Departments as necessary, referring back to the ministerial Committee on Agricultural Policy if agreement cannot bereached.Conclusion17.      I recommend the following negotiating limits?(i) A total award of  53.5 million.(ii) An increase in the guaranteed price for beef of 12s. 6d per cwt.-4-
(iu)An increase of l^d per gallon in the guaranteed price of milk.(iv)An   increase of Is. 6d per cwt. in the guaranteed price for wheat.(v) An increase of Is. per score in the guaranteed price for pigs.(vi) Distribution of the balance of the  53.5 million between theremaining elements of the award to be worked out by theDepartments concerned, referring to the ministerial committee if agreement cannot be reached.I ask the Cabinet to decide;(vii) whether the farmers should be given an assurance that the guaranteed price for beef will not be reduced at the next twoReviews (paragraph 12 above); and(viii) whether the standard quantity for wheat should be abolished(paragraph 14 above).M0 S070, Whitehall, S.W.1.30th January, 1968-5-

MNEX IIThe objective for beef production under the selective expansionprqgraihme is 797,000 tons by 1970-71.     The Report on AgriculturalObjectives says it is still feasible to aim at 781,000 tons by then.This v/ould call for an increase of 54,000 tons, involving an expansion oftlic dairy herd and an additional 200 oillion gallons of milk which v/ouldnot bo needed for the liquid milk aarket but v/ould go to milk products.Achievement of the target v/ould save  15 million of beef imports and 14 million of imports of milk products.2.     The Treasury believe that this target could only be achieved at a disproportionate cost to the Exchequer.     They argue that it cost 95 million&apos;to secure an expansion of 50,000 tons between 1964 and 1967and a total subsidy payment over that period of  200 million on beef alone.(But the Agricultural Departments argue that over half of this related tomilk and therefore fell on the consumer rather than the Exchequer;   thatof the total Exchequer spending on beef, only  14g&quot; million represented the excess of awards over increased costs;   and that the total cost of exchequer support should properly be compared not with the increased production of 50,000 tons but with the total value of beef and milkoutput ( 1,000 million and  1,670 million respectively).3.     Beef production is still expanding, but the rate of expansion isslowing down.     Cost increases since the last Review are equivalent to12s 6d per live cwt.4.     The Agricultural Departments recommend an increase in the guaranteed price for beef of 13s 6d, and increases in the hill cow and beef cowsubsidies by 40s and 30s respectively, with assurances that there willbo no reductions in the guaranteed price or the beef cow subsidy at thenext two Reviews.5.     Tho Treasury recommend an increase in the guaranteed price of only5sj   DEA recommend an increase of 12s 6d (which would cover tho cost increase);   neither recommend an increase in the cow subsidies orassurances for the next two Reviews.     The Foreign Office is also opposedto giving assurances until there has been a further examination of our long-term expansion objectives.
6.     On milk, the Agricultural Departments recommend an increase in the guaranteed price of ifd per gallon, \?hich includes an increase of 0.271which is due under automatic adjustments.     DEA recommend an increase ofI4&amp; and Treasury Id.     If there were no increase at all in the presentguaranteed price, the retail price would be expected to go up to meethigher distributive margins from the present lOd a pint to lOgd inDecember I968.     This Increase would be brought forward to May if therecommendations of the Agricultural Departments were accepted, to Julyif the DEA view were accepted, and to August on the Treasury recommendation.-3-
