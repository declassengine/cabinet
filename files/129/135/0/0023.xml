:IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*8 GOVERNMENT)C(68) 23 COPY NO.      4815th January, 1968CABINETDEFENCE CUTS: DISCUSSIONS WITH GOVERNMENTS OFAUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, MALAYSIA AND SINGAPOREMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth affairs as my colleagues know, I have just returned from consultationsabout our new defence cuts in the Far East with the four commonwealth governments in the area.    I outline below the principal reactions ofthese countries, and then draw some general conclusions.general.       Though there are many differences in emphasis and still more in tactics between the four Governments (and I set out the details below),the main reactions cf all four Governments were basically the same,viz, that -(i) the speed of our withdrawal by 31st March, 1971 would allowno prospect for any other force to be trained and equippedin time to take our place?(ii)  our general capability lucked credibility;(iii)  therefore there would be-a lack of confidence in the area which ran the risks of -(a) cornmunalist troubles in Malaysia;(b) encouragement to communists in both Singapore and malaysia;(c) renewed Indonesian aggression and possibly evenintervention by the Philippines in East Malaysia; and(d) endangering global security by sparking off in one ofthe danger spots of the world a local conflict which,with Communist China in the background, couldescalate into a great-power confrontation.
SB RET3.      All of course drew attention to our past and sometimes very-recent assurances.    All thought our action would have wider andunfortunate economic repercussions for us.    Mr. Lee specificallythreatened retaliatory action; but the Australians and Malaysians made it equally clear that, if the decision stood, they would be compelledin their own interests to take action which would hurt us.    And malaysia and Singapore drew attention to the serious economic consequences forthem of our accelerated withdrawal.    There was scepticism, especiallyin Australia and Singapores that we would achieve worth-while savingsby a precipitate withdrawal and everywhere I met the belief that for short-term economic reasons we were taking historical decisions whichwould be irreversible and might have disastrous consequences in years to come.4.      All emphasised for different reasons that the Americans couldnot and should not take our place even if they were willing to.    Australiaand New Zealand are willing to maintain their present contribution, but could not operate in a vacuum.    Australia maintained that she could not significantly increase her contribution without making a defence effortrelatively more than Britain5 sj and so did New Zealand, who arefacing economic difficulties of their own.5.       Many (especially the Australians) made the point that if rumoursproved true that orders for the F.ill were to be cancelled, then our general capability to operate outside Europe would indeed totally lackcredibility.Malaysia6.       The Malaysian Government have a deep feeling of being let down,considering how closely our new proposals follow on the assurances we gave last July and the shock of devaluation.    It would be almost impossible for them to acquire and operate by 1971 the sophisticatedmilitary equipment they consider necessary and which we had previouslysaid we could provide.    They are worried about the implications of our decisions for the security of Ea,st Malaysia, responsibility for whichthey only assumed from us on the basis of our undertakings under theDefence Agreement.    They are doubtful of the meaningfulness of our general capability for operations in their area until we can give them more specific information about ita    The outcome of this will to a largeextent govern their response to our offer to reinterpret the Anglo-Malaysian Defence Agreement after 1971s  they stressed the importancethey attach to the continuation of the Agreement, but they do not want the shadow without the substance.    They would like our help ininvolving Australia and New Zealand in future defence commitments to them.    Although the Minister of Finance indicated that they would now consider themselves free from restraint on economic matters and free to protect their interests even at the expense of ours, the Tunkusignificantly dissociated himself from Mr. Leexs retaliatory threatsand blackmailing tactics.
Singapore7.       On my arrival in Singapore I faced the situation that theGovernment was already aware from the Malaysians of the substance of our proposals and following an emergency Cabinet meeting had putinto effect a militant campaign against them before even hearing them from me at first hand.    Thus, Mr. Idee had already recorded a BBCinterview in which he threatened retaliatory measures against us ifwe decided to withdraw by 1971, including withdrawal of his sterling balances and retaliation against British commercial interests in Singapore.Mr. Lee may to some extent have been bowing to the views of some ofthe more militant of his colleagues, such as the Minister of Finance,Dr. Goh;  or he may have been trying to recover ground lost by what hehad come to believe were mistaken past tactics based on optimisticco-operation;  or he may have been influenced by Mr. Mintoffs visit.What is incontrovertible is that his whole team of Ministers and senior officials were united in their mood of bitterness and frustration, leadingthem to resort to any tactics which might enable them either to influence our decision or to make good the damage by all means at theircommand.    Whatever the outcome I fea.r we have inevitably lost muchgood will.    The strength of their reaction is aggravated by the short time which has elapsed since our assurances last July and by their belief that our new decisions are not justified on economic grounds alone.8.       In my talks with Mr. Lee I did my best to convince him thatblackmailing threats were a mistaken policy;  and at our joint press conference he went some way to retract.    I think he regretted his BBCinterview: and we know he kept his promise to me to try to stop it, buta version had already been broadcast.    But he is in a near-hystericaland unpredictable state.    Dr. Goh has subsequently restated in moreconsidered terms the action the Singapore Government will take if weconfirm the decision to withdraw by 1971.    This includes the withdrawalof their sterling balances phased evenly over the three intervening years.9.      During the official talks the Singapore Governments positionemerged as follows.    They face the dilemma that they must above allmaintain confidence in the security of their future if they are to surviveeconomically;  they feel this to be vital for the overseas investor.    Whileaid on a substantial scale from us would help in the short term, they are more concerned about the provision of a credible military deterrent in succession to our presence.    They do not consider our new policy, as atpresent defined, will provide this.    Their main anxieties centre onIndonesia (though they clearly have Malaysia in mind).    They thereforefeel they must invest heavily in the sophisticated equipment such asair defence, fighter aircraft and ships which they had previously believedwe would provide;  but they are dismayed by the knowledge that it willbe quite impossible for them to acquire the skills to operate them by1971.    ViThile therefore they would like no announcement of our date of withdrawl, they attach even more importance to an extension of thedate beyond 1971, so as to give them a better chance to make the necessaryeconomic and military adjustments.
10.       Mr, Lee was determined to come to London to state his case in person and is now here.New Zealand11.       The New Zealand Governments understanding of our economic difficulties and their recognition that the decisions were for us to takedid not conceal their deep sense of shock and sadness at what theyclearly regarded as the end of an era.    Their main anxiety centresround the nature of our general capability after our withdrawal and our continuing will and ability to deploy it East of Suez.    They regard this as the test of our Intention to honour our frequently reaffirmed assurance that we will come to their assistance as they came to ours in two worldwars.    In their eyes this implies a general capability with troopsproperly trained and with the right equipment for the area and the ability to get there in time.    They were apprehensive about their continuingability to maintain, far less increase, their forces in Malaysia and singapore after our withdrawal.    They could only do so in association with a great -power, and the United States showed no inclination to takeover our role.    Moreover their defence planning v/as very dependenton Australia, who were still undecided on a number of important Issues.12.       Jhliis Press statement Mr. Holyoake stressed the importancethe New Zealand Government attached to the existing arrangements for commonwealth defence co-operation in South East Asia and to the continuation of a meaningful association with Britain.    He indicated the marked concern they v/ould feel if there were to be any significantacceleration of the plans for withdrawal which we announced last July.Australia13.      Australian Ministers presented their case impressively, withoutrecrimination but with deep feeling.    This was the third occasion intwo years that they had been asked to adopt a new basis for their own defence planning.    They were intensely sceptical of the relevance of our general capability to the problems of their own security.    It was not aquestion of fulfilling our moral obligation to them by fighting on theAustralian mainland.    Their security lay further north, where we stillhad a vital part to play in ensuring stability until a credible regionaldefence system emerged.    This v/ould require time, and 1971 would allowfar too little time.    They were prepared to continue their contribution,but they could not afford to increase it significantly, and they certainlycould not themselves provide the defence umbrella in South East Asiaunder which our lucrative commercial interests could continue toprosper.    They felt it was not a matter only of regional security but ofglobal security and they thought it was most important to carry theUnited States with us.    They did not think it would be possible or evendesirable for the United States to take our place.    We were presentingthem with cruel decisions in Malaysia while they were fighting in vietnam, where they did not even have our support in words.    they felt the savings we would make from hastening our withdrawal from sucha sensitive area were small in relation to the issues at stake and they thought that we should find the savings from some other area.    In brief,the Australian Government urged that we should make no announcementof a date for our final withdrawal;  that we should extend the date&quot;considerably&quot; beyond 1971j   that our general capability should bemeaningful in their context and should be seen in our announcement to be
so;  and that we should be as flexible and helpful as possible in settling the future of our defence installations in Malaysia and Singapore and inthe detailed timing of the rundown of our forces so as not to leave theAustralian forces unnecessarily exposed.14.      The Australian Government later handed over a memorandum,a copy of which is annexed to this paper.    They also made clear in a press statement that they could not accept our proposals and expressed their keen concern at them.Five Power Conference15.      In Kuala -Lumpur the Tunku pressed on me strongly the idea hehad advanced last year for a conference of the Commonwealth countriesdirectly concerned in order to discuss the defence problems thrown upby our withdrawal.    In order to moderate the reactions to our proposals  felt it impossible to dissent, and indeed saw some possible advantage in such a conference at the appropriate level and at the right time.I therefore undertook to convey his suggestion to the Governments ofAustralia, New Zealand and Singapore.    I made it clear that such aconference could only be held on the firm understanding that it wouldtake place on the basis of decisions we would already have taken.16.      Singapore and Australia expressed their readiness to take partin such a conference though Australia was sceptical about its usefulness.New Zealand were cautious, in advance of the Australian reaction onwhich they are absolutely dependent.17.      While I fully reserved our position about the timing and the levelof representation of the conference, I believe personally such a meeting would be both in our own interests and the least we can do to seek means to mitigate the dangers of a vacuum caused by our own Withdrawal.    Thesituation is different and the problems more urgent than when theTunku first proposed a conference last summer.    A number of practicalissues have to be settled quite soon if we are to speed up our withdrawal.These include the future of a whole range of our defence facilitiesincluding the airfields and air defence systems, some of whicn likeButterworth are shared with and all of which are of concern to other commonwealth Governments.    I do net think these matters can becarried to speedy finality in bilateral exchanges.    A conference wouldalso be the only way of bringing together all those who will be concernedwith the defence of Malaysia and Singapore after our withdrawal in orderto discuss what arrangements v/ill be necessary when we leave.    Inparticular it seems the best way of persuading Malaysia and Singaporeto tackle their defence problems jointly and to induce Australia andNew Zealand to decide the extent of their future association with. them.Conclusion18.      In accordance with the wishes of the Cabinet, I presented our proposals a.s firm decisions, although I made it clear that these v/ouldnot become final until after my return and until I had had the opportunityto convey the views of Commonwealth Governments to my colleagues.Their arguments fall broadly Into two parts;  the first concei*ning thedate of our withdrawal, and the second concerning our military capabilityto operate in the area thereafter.
19.My general conclusions on these issues are.-(i) We should decide that our final withdrawal from Malaysia and singapore should be on a date later than 31st March, 1971jI believe strongly that this is right on the merits of the case,both because it would give more time for adjustments and because the economic savings are small.    if, for example,we extended the date to 31st March, 1972, this extension of onlyone year would increase the time scale by one-third and very greatly ease many of the attendant problems both for ourselves and our allies.    In addition it would make the commonwealth countries feel that their strong representations had beenheeded, that consultation had been more than merely the presentation of a fait accompli.    Thus it would mitigate the damage to our relations with countries in which we havestrong economic interests.(ii) In designing our general capability after 1971, we should ensureit will carry credibility with our Commonwealth partners inthe Far East.    It ought to be shaped so that if we decideBritish interests are at stake at any time in the Far East,we have the military means to deploy our capability.    Thisought to be made clear in the announcement.(iii) We should be willing to take part in a conference with Australia,New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore to consider the practical problems thrown up by our new timetable, while making it clearthat the timetable itself and the abolition of the specialcapability cannot be reopened at the conference.(iv) We should be flexible and helpful in disposing of our defence facilities in Malaysia and Singapore with a view to ensuring the future security of the area and preserving the interests ofother Commonwealth Governments.(v)  We should also be generous in providing training and secondingexpert personnel after withdrawal in view of the fact that according to CinCFE it would take Singapore and Malaysiaapproximately five years to train specialists to operate theirown air defence.(vi) We should reach very early decisions on substantial aid forMalaysia and Singapore up to the time of our withdrawal.G.M.T.Commonwealth Office, S.W.1.14th January, 1968- 6-
ANNEXAIDE ME MOIRETALKS WITH THE RT. HON. GEORGE THOMSON, MP,.SECRETARY OF STATE FOR COMMONWEALTH affairs in THE BRITISH GOVERNMENTThe Australian Government has received from the Secretary ofState the proposals of his Government providing for complete withdrawalof British defence forces from bases in Malaysia and Singapore by31st Marcha, 1971,    The proposals make no provision beyond that date for any form of continuing British military presence in the region.    Theonly provision spoken of, which in itself must be open to question as toits availability and effectiveness, is a possible provision derived from ageneral military capability located in Europe,2,      It is stated by the Secretary of State that announcement of withdrawl and other aspects of the policy is to be made next weekand that there is no possibility of postponement, either of decisionor announcement,3,       The Australian Government has heard these proposals withdismay and anxiety.    They represent a basic and drastic change inthe British decisions taken and announced in mid-1967, which were themselves a considerable modification of previous understandings,4,       There is at the outset one fundamental point.    It is that questionsof security are global questions and the security of all countries, includingBritain, v/ould be threatened by conflict in South East Asia,    The presenceof allied forces in Malaysia is not only, or even principally, a question ofthe defence of continental Australia, though obviously that is not absentfrom the situation.    But wider security is the present issue.     Thereare present and potential threats to peace in South East Asia,    Themost aggressive nuclear power is in Asia,    Furthermore, whileAustralia appreciates British statements that Britain will rally tothe assistance of Australia if it is attacked, aid In extremity is notour chief present worry.    The real objective must be to prevent globalor regional security ever deteriorating to such a point that Australia andits neighbours come under attack, or that conflicts develop, howeversmall or local in origin, which consume world peace.    British policyhitherto has contributed, in concert with other allies, to regional security.Its newly decided policy can do no other than damage the regional securitysystem,5,       Furthermore, even though the withdrawal may not be finallyaccomplished until 1971, the announcement of final withdrawal fromthe mainland without provision for continuing presence in any formwill inevitably produce in the short term as well as the long termpolitical uncertainties and risks in the South East Asian region,6,       These defence policy changes are permanent and perhapsirreversible.    Their consequences in the short and long term formorale and security in this criticially important region, and in ouropinion for Britain itself, outweigh the contribution which they can make to the necessary objective of restoring Britain&apos;s economic position,
Given that expenditures must now be reduced in the order spoken of bythe Secretary of State, there is surely justification for pressing from europe more saving so that in the sensitive area of South East Asia,where dangers are now more present, a continuing presence could bemaintained.   La relative terms, the magnitude of the outlay requiredfor this is small.7.      It appear-s that the British proposals place emphasis on british forces for the future being oriented to Europe and European requirements.This suggested to the Australian Government that such forces would zxdtbe sufficiently mobile nor be of a nature suited for use in South east asia.    Moreover, their use appeared to be subject to approval byBritain^ NATO allies.    Mr. Thomson suggested that these difficulties might be overcome.    Very relevant were the structure and character ofthe British forces.     This was a matter calling for examination by thedefence authorities in London after Cabinet had made its decision in broad principle.    The Australian Ministers emphasised that the availability,mobility and suitability of the British forces for use in South East Asiawere of crucial importance and should not be regarded as a matter of detail to be worked out subsequently.8,      It is essential that neither in appearance nor in fact should theresponsibility for regional security in the Malaysia/Sin gap ore area betransferred, virtually in total, to the United States.    It would be an erroron the part of the United Kingdom to formulate their policy upon thepremise that the vacuum that would be created by the withdrawal ofthe United Kingdom would, since it cannot be filled by Australia, be automatically filled by the United States for reasons of its own totalstrategy.    As the Australian Government sees it, there is alreadyabundant evidence of the great risks that attend any world power, howevergreat,, being seen or placed in the position of sole guarantor, and in anycase, it is a question whether the United States electorate would accept any extension of United States commitment,9.      If withdrawal must proceed, the Australian Government believes that the timetable for it should be stretched out.    More time is a primerequirement in both a military and diplomatic sense.    For instance, thecurrent position is complicated by the existence of the Vietnam conflictand by the facts of the United States Presidential election year.    time is also needed to allow Malaysia and Singapore to make economic andother adjustments,10,       The Australian Government has been and still is prepared towork in association with Britain to preserve the concept of Common-wealth defence co-operation in this part of the world.    We have indicated our readiness to take part in Five Power talks to discussthe arrangements required for this purpose for the future.    But wedo not have the capacity to replace Britain,    We believe most emphati-cally that Britain has continuing obligations for the security of malaysia/Sin gap ore v/hile these countries build up their own defence forces and a better basis for stability in the region is established.Here again time is a vital factor.
11.       It is our view that it is in the interests of the partner countries that united Kingdom, Australian and New Zealand forces should continue to bein Malaysia and Singapore within at least for the time being the framework of the Anglo-Malaysian Defence Agreement, which provides the best basis for Commonwealth co-operation.    But any decision by the United kingdom to create a situation where there would be no effective military presenceby Britain must bring into the most serious question the continuingsignificance and value of the Agreement.    Moreover, whereas in thediscussion in 1967 the British Government clearly recognised theimportance of the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve for Australiaas the essential basis for the presence of our own forces in Malaysia,there seems to be no future for the Reserve under the proposals as theyhave been outlined by Mr, Thomson,Conclusion12,       For the reasons set out above and more extensively elaboratedin discussion with the Secretary of State, the Australian Governmentprofoundly disagrees with what the British Government now proposesand asks that it reconsider its proposals.    If the British Governmentis not prepared to depart from the fundamental bases of its proposals,the Australian Government asks that the time now set for the majorwithdrawal of British forces in Malaysia, and Singapore be extendedas long as possible and that thereafter some British forces should still remain available in the area to provide balanced forces in concert with those contributed by other partner Governments,    Finally, theAustralian Government urges that the public announcement of policy should make clear britain s continued interest in the maintenance of security in the South East Asia areas and its intention to continue toplay such part in this as it can.Prime Minister&apos;s DepartmentCanberra A.C. T.12th January, 1968
