SECRET A rSODDOCUMENT IS THE PILOPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOYERNMENT)C(-68) 15 COPY NO.11th January, 1968CABINET65PUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  POST-DEVALUATION MEASURESDEFENCE CUTS: NEGOTIATIONS WITH SINGAPORE AND MALAYSIAMemorandum by the First Secretary of StateBACKGROUNDCopies of telegrams exchanged between the Prime Minister andthe Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs, reporting on the latter&apos;discussions with Malaysian and Singapore Ministers earlier this week,have been circulated separately (C(68) 13).    A further telegram is attachedat Annex A to this paper.    Briefly, in Kuala Lumpur the Malaysianreaction to the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s approach was one of distressand grave disappointment, expressed in courteous terms,    In particular,the Tunku urged that Britain should take the lead in convening a five-power conference (i0 e0 with Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore) togo into ail these matters;  that after the withdrawal of British forces assuch from Malaysia and Singapore, help should still come from Britainif required (the clear implication was that he would wish the defence agreement to continue);  and that Malaysia1 s economic needs should be looked at sympathetically.    In Singapore the response was angry andmilitantc,     Mr. Lee threatened retaliatory action, including switchingout of sterling, and insisted that he wished to meet the Prime minister in London before any decision was taken.    This has been agreed to, onthe understanding tnat the British Government^ gioup of proposals,including the new date for our final withdrawal, will still be announced on 16th January;  that he must discuss them in London constructively,and without any attempt at public proselytising;  and that he must refrain from switching out of sterling meanwhile.    Mr, Lee has emphasised theimportance of retaining the confidence of investors in Singapore, the potential danger of Indonesian aggression, and the impossibility of singapore training her defence forces with sophisticated weapons by1971 (though he could accept 1973 or possibly 1972).    On 10th JanuaryDrD Goh, purporting to speak for the Singapore Government, told theBritish High Commissioner that if the British Government feltcompelled to go ahead next week with announcing our withdrawalin 1971 despite the intervening consultations with Mr. Lee, the Singapore government would feel obliged to take the following action:(a) To withdraw their sterling balances, one-third each year up to1971,(b) To break the monopoly of the Far East Shipping Conference.
(c)     To give improved access to the Singapore market to other countries,thereby affecting British exports.He said these actions would not be taken dramatically or suddenly, and accepted that they could not expect to get Bloodhounds or aircraft from us and that it might cause us to change our attitude about mitigatory aid.Dr. Goh claimed that these actions would not be aimed at hurting Britain(though they might have this effect);  and that it was not the SingaporeGovernments intention to utter threats or attempt blackmail.    He wishedmerely to set his Governments declaration of intention on the record sothat we could take it into account in framing our own actions.2.      I now invite my colleagues to consider the line which the PrimeMinister and other Ministers concerned might take when talking toMr. Lee in London on 14th January (and on 15th January if discussionscontinue that day).    In considering this line 1 v/ould ask my colleagues to bear in mind that Her MajestyTs Governments new decisions havesuddenly presented Mr, Lee with a wide range of unwelcome and difficult problems, to which we must expect his initial reaction to be stronglyadverse.    In part our task will therefore be to induce him to examine these problems sensibly and constructively.Summary of recommendations.      Defence(a) It should be confirmed to Mr. Lee at the start that there can beno question of changing the new date for our final withdrawal,,(b) We should remind him that after our forces have withdrawn weshould retain, the ability to help him from our general capability, if thecircumstances at any given time in our judgment demand it.    We could also offer arrangements for periodic visits by our armed services,(c) We should discourage Mr. Lee from any attempt to go it alone in defence matters;  v/e should not consider making defence equipmentavailable to Singapore in circumstances which would provoke an armsrace with Malaysia;   and we should take as our long-term objective the achievement of quadripartite defence arrangements between Australia,New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore,(d) If Mr. Lee accepts the principle of a joint defence system, andif the security difficulties in relation to Bloodhound missiles can be overcome, v/e should offer him the chance to take over the Ground-to-AirMissiles and the Master Radar in Singapore on the understanding that were/ould make a comparable offer to Malaysia in respect of the similarequipment at Butter woith.(e) We should give Mr. Lee no undertaking that we might makeHunter aircraft available.(f) If Mr. Lee is prepared to discuss a defence plan for Singapore(as part of an area defence system), we should be prepared to offer ateam of British officers and technical personnel.    If he presses for defence aid he should be told that we should be ready to consider eachrequest on its merits, but that if we gave him defence aid it might affectthe amount of economic aid we could give.
(g) If Mr, L.ee revives his proposal for a five-power force under british command, he could be told that while we could not make any-military contribution to such a foice after our withdrawal, we wouldbe prepared, if it v/ere the wish of the other Governments concerned,to consider seconding personnel to its headquarters0(h) If Mr, Lee presses the idea of a five-power conference on defence problems, we could say that in principle we would be ready to take part,but that our contribution would be largely advisory and directed towardshelping the other four countries to take over those defence arrangements which we have largely been operating on our own.Aid(i)     It will be convenient to turn the conversation from defence, onwhich we can offer little, to aid.(j/     No decision is needed now on aid levels after 1971, but we should recognise that continuing aid for Singapore is likely to have to be at therate oi at least  30 million a year for some years after 1971, and 10 million a year for Malaysia for at least two yearsc(k)    We should tell Mr. Lee that provided we continue to receivefriendly co-operation in the yundown, and that measures are not takenby the singapore.pore Government which would, be harmful to sterling or toour national or commercial and investment interests (but that, on thecontrary, steps are taken to reassure British investors and traders),we would be willing to enter into commitments of aid amounting to 45 million in respect of the period up to 31st March, 1971.    (ThePrime Minister might be authorised to go up to  50 million if ho thoughtthat in spite cf what is said in paragraph 19 an agreement on this levelcould be secured straightaway.    If this does not appear likely, it wouldbe better to reserve the higher figure for the later negotiations),,    Wewould also be ready to commit ourselves to continuing aid thereafter,though not at a specified rate,(l)     We should add that so far as practicable the aid would be usedfor productive projects, but we would be ready to agree to a proportionof it being devoted to other purposes.    Recognising this la.tter need, weshould (as in Malta) be ready to provide aid in the proportions of 75 percent grant/25 per cent loan.     The loans would be on reasonable terms.We would expect import requirements for add projects to be obtainedfrom this country.(m)   We should make a similar offer to Malaysia, of  20 million forthe first three years with a discretionary addition of  5 million ifnecessary to reach agreement,ARGUMENT:  DEFENCE4,       Mr, Eee&apos;s approach is likely to cover the following main issues:-(l)     Security of Singapore, including:-(a)   The date of our final withdrawal,
(b)   Our capacity to help militarily after we have withdrawn,(c.)   Defence aid.(d)   Multilateral defence arrangements,(2)    Economic assistance.5.       If my colleagues feel that there is still no ground for changing thedate of our final withdrawal^ I think this should be made plain to I/Ir, Leeat the start.    He should be reminded that the Prime Minister&apos;s agreement to discussions in London was on the understanding that there could be noquestion of any change in the arrangements for the announcement on 16thJanuary of the Government1 s group of proposals, including the new date for our final withdrawal,    Mr. Lee should be told that we hope he can assure us that Dr. Gohrs statement of 10th January (see paragraph 1 above)does not represent a considered policy decision on the part of the singapore Government, since if it did we should see no basis for fruitfuldiscussion with him.6,       Provided Mr, Lee satisfies us on this point, we could remind him that after our forces have withdrawn we should retain the aoility to help him from our general capability, if the circumstances at any given timein our own judgment demanded it.    Since Mr, Lee is likely to ask forundertakings in respect of the availability of specific force levels, whichwould mean in fact reverting to our original plan for a special capabilityfor use in the area., we will have to divert his attention to other ways inwhich we can help him.    For example, arrangements could be made forperiodic visits by the forces of our three armed services to Singapore^,7.      We must make it clear to Mr. Lee that once our forces have withdrawn, the security of Singapore will be bound up in the general security of the area as a whole0    In defence matters, however much money Singapore might spend, she could not go it alone.   We should therefore discourage Mr. Lee from any attempt to do so    He has asked to purchase the Bloodhound Missiles at present in singapore and later on Hunter aircraft to provide an air defence system for the island.    Preliminary technical talks have already been held in Singaporeabout possible British help towards an air defence system for the area,which would be concerted with Malaysia and Australia,    In these discussions it has been made plain that the air defence of Singapox*ecan only be considered realistically in the context cf the air defenceof the Malaysian Peninsula as a whole.    While therefore we shouldbe ready to consider making defence equipment available to Singapore,we should not do so in circumstances which would provoke an armsrace between Singapore and Malaysia,    Although we are familiar withMalaysia&apos;s plans for military expansion, which have been cut back to save their foreign exchange, Mr. Lee has never responded to our offer to discuss with him a rational defence system for Singapore,    Now thatwe are finally withdrawing from Singapore and Malaysia it is all themore important that there should be joint arrangements between thetwo countries,    Australia and New Zealand can play a crucial part inthis, and we should take as our long-term objective the achievement of quadripartite defence arrangements between these four countries^
8.       Provided Mr. Lee accepts the principle that a rational defence system for Singapore must be a joint one, as stated in the preceding paragraph, and provided adso that we can overcome the securitydifficulties in relation to Bloodhounds, which are described in Annex Bto this paper, I would be in favour of offering Mr0 Lee the chance totake over the Ground-to-Air Missiles and the Master Radar in Singaporeon the understanding that we would make a comparable offer to Malaysia,after consultation with the Australians, in respect of the similar equipmentat Butterworth0    Malaysia has no fighter aircraft, and I am strongly opposed to giving Mr. Lee any undertaking that we might make Hunteraircraft available.     This role in the defence of both countries could best be filled by the Australians who at present contribute a fighter squadronto the defence of the Malaya/Singapore area.9.       Provided that Mr. Lee is prepared to discuss a defence plan for singapore (as part of an area defence system) with our military advisers,we should be prepared to offer him a team of British officers and technical personnel to assist in training and in operating equipment which theSingaporeans cannot yet operate for themselves.    If we do this wemust cf course maintain our existing arrangements for making british personnel available to the Malaysian armed forces.    If Mr. Lee pressesfor defence aid for the purchase of military equipment in this country, heshould be tcld that we should be ready to consider each request on its merits, but that if v/e gave him defence aid it might affect the amountof economic aid we could give,10.       If in the context of multilateral defence arrangements Mr, Leerevives his proposal for a five-power force under British command, hecould be told that while we could not make any military contribution tosuch a force after our withdrawal, we would be prepared, if it were the wish of the other Governments concerned, to consider secondingpersonnel to its headquarters.11.       If Mr. Lee raises the Tunku&apos;s proposals for a five-power conference to consider defence problems in the area, we should say that this was very much a matter for the other countries concerned,since it would be looking ahead to the period after our withdrawal.    Ifhe presses the idea of such a conference, v/e could say that in principlewe would be ready to take part, but that our contribution would be largelyadvisory and directed tov/ards helping the other four countries to takeover those defence arrangements which we have largely been operating on our own.ARGUMENT:  ATP12,       Since we are not likely to be able to give Mr. Lee much satisfactionon the defence side, I consider it should be our aim to direct his attention,at the right moment in the talks, to our readiness to nelp in the adaptation of the Singapore economy to the situation arising from the complete with-drawal of our forces.    We are already committed to providing aid to mitigate the economic effects of oar departure, and the Chancellor has accepted that it will have to be at a higher level because of the acceleration-tion of the rundown.    We had intended to resume negotiations in earlyFebruary, and it would have been necessary to make an offer then.    Wecould with advantage make it at once,
13.       The figures accepted by the Cabinet on 21st December(CC(67) 74th Conclusions) for aid commitments that might bemade to Mr. -Lee and Tun Razak by the Prime Minister at Melbourne,in respect of the first three years, up to the mid-point of the rundown,viz. 1st April, 1971, were  25 million for Singapore and  18 million forMalaysia.    These were related to estimates of damage to their economiesfr orn 1967 to 1971 amounting to about  30 million for Singapore and 23 million for Malaysia;  much of this money was intended to go intoproductive projects;  not all of it was expected to be spent in the first three years, but to the extent that it could be quickly and productivelyinvested it was expected to reduce the damage to the economies, andtherefore the cost of aid, for subsequent years,14.       The damage resulting from the much swifter rundown will be greatly increased.    Rough calculations show that up to March, 1971,it may be expected to amount to  60-70 million for Singapore and 25-30 million for Malaysia,    In the following years it may be expected,for a time, to amount to a figure of the order of about  44 million a year for Singapore and  16 million a year for Malaysia, abated only by thereturn from such productive investment as may have been made,15,      A total British withdrawal by 31st March, 1971, will now notonly produce larger economic effects than on the previous timetablebut will produce them much more rapidly.    It will be completed beforeproductive investment can begin to bring in significant returns.     the singapore and Malaysian Governments will therefore have to take more direct measures to relive unemployment, which is already at the 7-9 percent level in Singapore,16,       During our negotiations with them on the basis of the old rundownplans the two Governments were asking for ten-year aid agreements onthe Malta model,   &quot;We promised Malta  50 million over ten years, and,as the Prime Minister said in Parliament on 27th July, &quot;the problem in singapore is no less formidable in nature than the Maltese problem and very much greater in size&quot; (Hansard, col, 1109).    When we were talkingof a longer rundown on the basis of the old timetable our hope was, however,that we could persuade them to accept limited agreements for three years,linked to the half-way stage in the rundown, combined v/ith assurances thataid would continue thereafter.17,       If the rundown is to be completed in 1971 it seems unlikely that athree-year aid agreement, even combined with promises of continued aidthereafter, will satisfy either Government.    It is likely that when nego-tiations with Singapore are resumed the demand for a longer-termagreement, covering aid to continue for at least six years, will be pressed.     The economic damage done to Singapore will be felt mostheavily in the three to five years after our departure, and the Singaporeansare unlikely to accept anything less than a quantified assurance of a largertotal of aid for Singapore in the second three years than in the first.     Theywill expect a written agreement.
18,       I am not asking for any decision now on the level of aid after 1971,,But it should be recognised now that continuing aid for Singapore is likelyto have to be at the rate of at least  30 million a year for some years after1971, and  10 million a year for Malaysia for at least tv/o years.-    If we find it necessary to accept five- or six-year, rather than three-year,agreements, the total figures involved are likely, if we are to reach asettlement, to be of this order.   The larger the figure offered for athree-year agreement, the greater will be the chance of securing anagreement limited to that period.19,       The Prime Minister must clearly be in a position to make an offer of aid to Lie, Lee in order to secure his co-operation in the rundownnow decided upon and to avoid a situa/cion in which Singapore takesretaliatory measures.    It is unlikely that Mr. Lee; even thoughDr. Goh is with him, will feel able to reach a deiinite agreementwhile he is in London next weekend without personal discussions with his Cabinet after his return.    Nevertheless he is more likelyto accept a substantial offer of aid for a three-year period as a basis for continuing negotiation? than to reject it outright.20,      In these circumstances I recommend that Mr. Lee should bemade an offer on 14th January, by British Mlinisters, in the following terms :-Provided that we continue to receive friendly co-operation in therundown, and that measures arc not taken by the Singapore government which would be harmful to sterling or to our national or commercial and investment interests (but mat, on thecontrary, steps are taken to reassure British investors andtrailers), we would be willing to enter into commitments of aid amounting to  45 million in respect of the period up to31st March, 197L,    (The Prime Minister might be authorisedto go up to  50 million if he thought that in spite of what is said in paragraph 19 an agreement on this level could be securedstraightaway.    If this does not appear likely, it would be better to reserve the higher figure for the later negotiations).    were/ould also be ready to commit ourselves to continuing aidthereafter, though not at a specified rate.    So far as practicablethe aid would be used foi productive projects, but we would beready to agree to a proportion of it being devoted to other purposes.    Recognising this latter need, we should (as in malta) be ready to provide aid in the proportions of 75 percent grant/25 per cent loan,,     The loans would be : :i reasonableterms.    We would expect important requirements for aidprojects to be obtained from this country,21,       A decision of this kind will mean that we must make a similaroffer to Malaysia with the least possible delay after our offer has beenmade co Mr. Lee.    For the three years we should offer  20 million,with a discretionary addition of  5 million if this were necessary toreach agreement.M.S.70, Whitehall, S.Y7.1.11th January, 1968
ANNEX, AIMMEDIATE SINGAPORE TO COMMONWEALTH OFFICETel. Ho, 32 9 January 1968SECRETFor Prime Minister from Commonwealth Secretary.Many thanks for your message in telegram No. 60 which reached me just as I was going into meeting with Lee.    Imanage! to have a word with him privately before full meeting and spoke to him as in your message.   He said at once that hewould accept your invitation and come this weekend with Dr. Goh.2,     At the full meeting I was able to make full statement ofour case (though not without interruption).     At the outset Leewas less nysterical and less threatening than he had been last night and emphasized above all following points;;-(i) Importance of retaining confidence of investorsin Singapore.(ii) Danger that announcement of early date v/ould give notice to Indonesia to prepare for aggression.(iii) Impossibility of Singapore being able to trainDefence Forces with sophisticated weapons in timeavaliable.He made it clear that he would accept withdrawal by 1973 or possibly 1972:    but what appalled him was prospect of announcingnext week a date as early as 1971.3o      In the course of discussion Lee made a number of commentsabout our domestic affairs on which we had some sharp exchanges.He reverted also to Singapore&apos;s losses on devaluation and bothhe and Goh quizzed us closely on savings likely to accrue fromaccelerated rundown in an effort to prove that this was not even In British interests.a.     After a hard-hitting session for two hours Lee concluded that there was not much more that could be said here and thatthey would have to thrash It out at Chequers.    We, therefore,concluded with agreement that we should announce his proposed visit.     Subsequently I spoke to him privately again andreminded him that it -would do him no good to continue with histhreats and that only purpose of his visit would be to havereasonable discussions about our joint problems.    He asked mewhether there was any prospect of getting a change in thedecision.    I told him that it was firm but reminded him thatI had been authorised to report back to the Cabinet, and heconcluded by saying he must hope for a change and, being anoptimist, he would come anyway.5.     At Joint Press Conference afterwards Lee went out of his way to say that he had been misrepresented In what he had said about retaliatory action against Britain.    He hoped thatwe would make a success of follow-up measures after devaluationand that our economy would be &quot;thriving and pushful&quot;.      I addedthat I hoped this would receive as much publicity as the earlierremarks attributed to him.
ANNEX BSECURITYASPECTS......OF A POSSIBLE SALE OFBLOODHOUND :T.2 TO SINGAPORESECURITY ASSESSMENT OF SINGAPOREOn the basis of our current assessment of the standardof security in Singapore we should not normally be justifiedin releasing information to the Singaporeans above the levelof CONFIDENTIAL..     This does not mean that exceptionscould not be made for special reasons, but in each case therisk and the balance of advantage would have to be carefully examined.   A factor to be taken into account in this instanceis that the risk in Singapore may well increase after british forces have been withdrawn.      It must be accepted that thereis a considerable risk that information released to theSingaporeans will be compromised.Pjll^MAA^OJlJ?^-.gJ[gg. IN BLOODHOUND MKo 22.     The main security problem with Bloodhound Mk.2 is thatthe weapon system includes certain TOP SECRET information,in particular the details of the Electronic Counter Counter-measures (ECCM)  equipment.     The ECCM capability of the system was one of the main reasons why the RAF bought Bloodhound MK-.2,In fact the latest ECCM modifications have not been incorporate.&apos;;in the Bloodhound Mk.2 equipment at Singapore (because of theimminence of v/withdrawal);    but what remains is still classifiedTOP SECRET.EFFECTS OP COMPROMISE3*     Detailed knowledge of the system could make it possiblefor an enemy to develop countermeasures which could largelyneutralize the effect of our Bloodhound defences.    under present plans the RAF intends to use Bloodhound Mk.2 atleast till 1975 with some units deployed in Cyprus and othersretained in the U.K. for overseas deployment as necessary.Their value might be much reduced if the system was compromisec-h.     Furthermore, Bloodhound Mk.2 has been sold to bothSwitzerland and Sweden.    Both countries would have to beinformed of a sale to any other country and would want an assurance about the security of the system in the other country&apos;s hands.ALTERNATIVES5o     A downgraded version of Bloodhound Mk.2 could beproduced but this might take as long as 18 months and costup to  1 million.    If the Singaporeans were to bear thiscost it would be difficult to conceal from them that theywere getting a system of reduced capability.      If there wereto be any chance of concealment it would be necessary forus to keep the weapons under our own control (and presumablyas our own property) while the modification work was done./CONCLUSION
CONCLUSION6o      If the Bloodhound Mk.2 equipment at Singapore weresold to the Singaporeans in its present form there wouldbe a serious risk of compromise which could greatly reducethe value of the Bloodhound defences of the United Kingdom,Sweden and Switzerland.   We should not necessarily know ifthe compromise had taken place.    The alternative of producing a downgraded version would be expensive and would involvepractical difficulties which might be insuperable.    We are continuing however to examine the problem in detail.
