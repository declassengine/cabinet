DOCUMENT IS THE FR.OPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y*S GOVERNMENT)C(68) 83rd January, 1968CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE; POST-DEVALUATION MEASURESLOCAL AUTHORITY manpower memorandum by the First Secretary of state as part of the economic measures now under consideration I was asked to consider with the Ministers concerned, and to report upon, the feasibility of restricting the growth of local authority manpower in1968-69.2.       There has been a steady growth in local authority employmentover the last few years, as the following figures show;Numbers employed by local authorities and in police forcesin Great Britain (full-time and part-time)Year	Male s	Females	Total(June)			1952	842,434	605, 8S7	1, 448, 2911958	909, 043	716,508	1, 625,5511961	962,032	793,230	1, 755,2621964	1,052,653	910,892	1,963,5451965	1, 066,933	957, 793	2, 024,7261966	1,106,113	1, 016,479	2 y 1 jd2y f3 9 21967	1, 140, 255	1, 076,560	2,216, 815A breakdown of the total figures for 1967 is given in the Annex,Education accounts for nearly half the total.    A notable feature has beenthe growth of part-time employment:  over the period 1952-67 men andwomen employed full-time increased by 30 per cent and 40 per cent respectively but part-time employees by 135 per cent and 148 per cent.3.      The numbers of local government staff are obviously related tothe policies which those staff are needed to implement, much of whichspring from central government initiative.    We therefore thought thatthe Home Affairs Committee should be asked to examine the possibilityof postponing the appointed days in any legislation now pending which made increased demands upon local authority staffing.-1-COPY NO.
4,      It has to be recognised, however, that under the rate support grant system there is in general no central control of local governmentstaffing, though the Home Secretary approves the establishments for police forces and the Minister of Transport has some control of the staff employed by local authorities as the Governments agents in trunk road construction and maintenance.    While, therefore, it might be valuableto identify, if this were possible, local authority services in whichstaffing cuts might be made, we are in no position to enforce these.The only really effective instrument available to us is the financial oneof the rate support grant itself.    The next grant period will begin inApril, 1969, and the negotiations for this will begin with the localauthority associations this autumn.    If it were made clear now that theGovernment intended a restrictive settlement on this next occasion, this might be expected to have some effect on staffing policies in 1968-69.It would be necessary to accept that some reduction in the standard oflocal authority services would be inevitable and the consequentrestrictions upon employment might lead to difficulties, for examplewith the teachers over ancillary staff, and to presentational problems in the development areas.5.      The form of any such announcement needs further thought, moreparticularly in relation to local authority consultation over rate support grant.    The Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Secretaryof State for Yfales have already sent a personal message to the Mayorsand Chairmen of Councils about the need for economy in capital and current expenditure in which they asked local authorities to scrutinisewith particular care proposals to recruit additional staff or start newservices;  and the Secretary of State for Scotland has circularised localauthorities stressing the need for economy.    We concluded that, in thelight of this, the Minister of Housing and Local Government should beasked to consider, firstly the form of a statement about rate support grant in the next period to be included in any general announcement of measures to be taken, which would be sufficiently emphatic to bringabout an immediate restraint on staffing;   and, secondly, whetherspecific guidance could be given to local authorities in the resultingsituation.M.
