HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PE.OPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(68) 1 COPY NO.3rd January., 1968CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  POST-DEVALUATIONSOCIAL SECURITY CONSEQUENCESMemorandum by tlie First Secretary of StateSummary, of the paper the Cabinet have already agreed that an increase in supplementary benefit will be necessary in 1968 of an amount and at a time to be decidedlater.    This v/ill not, however, meet the needs of the families of the lowest wage-earners in full employment and those subject to the wagestop.2,       Rate rebates are already available both to the very low wage-earning householders and to a much larger number with resources some-what above supplementary benefit level.    The total numbers eligible are,however, by now much below those envisaged at the start of the scheme in 1966 and there is a strong case for revising the income limits by affirmative order broadly to restore the original scope of the scheme.This would cost some  70 5 million (or possibly  10, 4 million) in a full year and would need to be accompanied by a further publicity campaign to improve the take-up of the benefit.    The new limits could be effective in the spring (April in England and Wales, May in Scotland) or the autumn(October in England and Wales, November in Scotland),,    Furtherconsideration needs to be given to the timing-3.       Raising the income limits for rate rebate would, however,only marginally affect the lowest wage-earners.    These would be helped more by an increase in the amounts of rate rebate.    Thiswould mean legislation.    The amount of extra help would not however be very large; it would vary with the amount of rates payable and wouldnot necessarily benefit the poorest most;  and it would not take accountof family size,,4,       A housing allowance has been considered and found too complexa matter for immediate decision.    A means-tested addition to family allowances is another possibility but this has the disadvantage for someof subsidisation and implied endorsement of low wages, that it would notachieve full take-up and that it would increase the means-tested group of social security benefit recipients.    Moreover, substantial problems ofmachinery would be involved.
5B       The selective principle would however be maintained if a general increase in family allowances were combined with appropriate adjustments in taxation.     There would be great presentational advantages if such a link could be established and announced as part of a social security packagewhich could cover both the increases in family allowances already decided upon for next April and such further increases as might later bedetermined in the light of devaluation.Background6.      At their meeting on 23rd November (CC(67) 68th Conclusions,Minute 4) the Cabinet considered a paper by myself (C(67) 184) on measures to protect the most vulnerable sections of the communityfrom hardship resulting from devaluation.    These are the people whoare eligible for supplementary benefit (including old, unemployed, sick and handicapped persons) and the lowest wage-earners whose resources are below the level of supplementary benefit for which they are, however,ineligible.    The Cabinet agreed that it would be necessary to increasesupplementary benefits during 1968, though it should not be necessaryto decide on the precise amount or timing of such an increase beforethe spring: I had mentioned in my paper that, on the assumption that prices were likely to rise during 1968 by some 5 per cent to 6 per cent,incre?.ses of supplementary benefit of some 4s, Od, a week might be needed by the end of the year, at a cost of some  35 millior; net in afull year,7,       This would net however meet the needs of the families of the lowest wage-earners in full-time employment (and those subject to wagestop) and for them I suggested that an increase in family allowances mightbe appropriate.    In discussion emphasis was laid on the desirability ofproviding for these families in a selective way and a suggestion was made that this might be achieved through the rate rebate scheme,    I v/as askedto go into this with the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of housing and Local Government, the Minister of Social Security and theChief Secretary, Treasury, and I have since done so, with help also fromthe Lord President and the Secretary of State for Wales,Rate Rebates: Raising the Income Limits8a      Rate rebates are at present available for householders not entitled to full supplementary benefit whose recent gross incomesamount to not more than  8 (single) or  10 (husband and wife), plus30s. Od, a child, with a tapering arrangement for those with incomesjust above this limits.    As such the scheme covers many of the 160,000households with children and other very low wage-earners whom we haveparticularly in mind, as well as more than one million others whoseresources are up to about  2 above supplementary benefit level.     Thetotal numbers eligible are well below those first envisaged when thescheme was introduced in 1966 owing to rises in wages and benefits which have occurred since, and the same process is likely to erodethe total numbers further still.    But rises in incomes have been accompanied also with rises in living costs and it seemed to mycolleagues and myself that there v/as a strong case for a revisionof the income limits to restore the ambit of the rate rebate schemeto broadly its original size,
9.       The Minister of Housing and Local Government has had in mind for this purpose raising the weekly income limits for single householdersfrom  8 to  9 and those for married householders from  10 to  11, withan extension of the allowances for children from 30s, 0d, to  2:  thiswould bring or keep within the scope of the scheme about 650,000 house-holders and might cost  7, 5 million in a full year,    A range of otherchoices is set out in the table at Annex,    With family needs in mindwe considered whether the allowances for children could possibly beincreased to  2 10s. Od,    This alternative would bring or keep 900,000householders v/ithin the scope of the scheme at a total additional cost of 10,4 million in a full year.     The numbers actually claiming rebateswould however be less0    At the moment out of some 1, 3 million entitledonly one million take up their entitlement, of whom 800, 000 arepensioners, and we agreed that a further publicity drive would be essential.Timing10,      We have the choice of effecting this increase either in the spring (April in England and Wales, May in Scotland) or in the autumn(October and November),   An autumn increase would cost less but thereis the difficulty that owing to the differences between England and Waleson the one hand and Scotland in their financial years and income assess-rnent periods, a deferment until autumn of a change in the rate rebateincome limits would mean that there would be a reduction in the numberseligible for rate rebate in Scotland during the preceding half-year whenthe Scottish assessment would reflect last autumn1? social securitybenefit increases.     There would be difficulty in adopting widely separatedates and it is a fact that a fair number of rebates are not actually paidor reflected in lower council rents until well on in the rating period:  thisis particularly true of tenants in private housing,,     On the other hand aspring increase in England and Wales would mean a temporary increasein the numbers eligible from April to September, 1968.    We concludedtherefore that the date of the increase required further consideration.An increase this spring could be brought about by an affirmativc order which would need to be made as soon as possible to give time for publicity and the necessary administrative arrangements.Rate Rebates: Raising the Amount of P-ebate11,       Raising the income limits for ra.te rebate would be worth-while in itself and-would benefit many poorer families but its effect on the lowest wage-earners could not be more than marginal, since theseare by and large already covered by the existing limits.     We therefore considered whether one might also proceed to raise the amounts of raterebate to cover in whole or in part the first  7 10s, Od, &quot;threshold&quot; andthe remaining one-third of the rates above that level which is notrebated.    Such a method would have the merits that it would benefit the poorer families, that it would apply also to retired people and thatrate rebates are known to be an acceptable form of selectivity.    but after much consideration we concluded that this would not really bevery effective for our purpose.     For one thing the total amount of extrahelp could not be very large, on average not much more than, say, S.15a year with the most generous scheme and often much less than this.Secondly, the amounts of rebate would naturally vary with the amountof rates and the poorest families would not necessarily receive the most
benefit,, Thirdly, such a scheme would not reflect varying sizes of family except through the operation of the income scale, since theamount of benefit would be uniform. There might be problems of ensuring that sub-tenants, for example, took up their entitlement;there might be awkward differences between one area and another;and any such scheme would require legislation which might provecontrover sial.Housing Allowances12.      We went on to examine other forms of selective benefit,    a housing allowance had been propounded last summer by the Chancellorof the Exchequer but the Cabinet then considered that, more particularlyin the light of the existing rate and local authority rent rebate schemes,this was too complex a matter for immediate decision and should form part of the longer-term studies of rent and rates now being undertaken by the Minister of Housing and Local Government.Means &quot;tested Family Allowances13.      We therefore looked again at the possibility of a selective additionto family allowances and examined first a means-tested system.    As tothis, we saw difficulties both of machinery and principle.     The main difficulty of principle appears to some of us to be the subsidisation andimplicit endorsement of low wages which this would involve and thedisincentive effects.     The second difficulty is that of achieving a fulltake-up.    On machinery we were informed that it was very doubtful if the Supplementary Benefits Commission could taKe on a scheme on ordinary supplementary benefit lines and impossible if at the same time they were occupied with an uprating of supplementary benefits.    It alsoappeared very doubtful whether the local authorities could be brought to administer a scheme dependent upon their rate rebate assessmentmachinery:  they would argue with some justice that their ratingmechanism ought not to be used for the purpose of social security benefits, especially of this nature.    Moreover such an arrangement would mean tying the new allowance to the income limits for the raterebate scheme which will be higher than for supplementary benefit andaccepting the standards of accuracy which any local authority may applyand any lack of uniformity following from local authority variation of practice.    We  concluded, therefore, that the existing family allowancesystem was to be preferred, and this too seemed preferable to some of us on a longer-term view in that this would avoid increasing the means -tested group of social security benefits.Selectivity by &quot;Give and Take&quot;14,       V/e were, however, clear that the selective principle must bemaintained in any increase in family allowances.    It followed, therefore,that any increase made across the board would need to be accompaniedby appropriate adjustments in taxation to ensure that it had the requiredselective effect.    How far one should go in this direction must, we thought, be a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer:   so too, inthe light of his decision on these points, should be the question of the tax machinery required^    But it did seem to us that there would be verygreat presentational advantages if a link between family taxation and family allowances could be established and announced as part of a social security
package.    Some of us thought that such a link should cover both the increases in family allowance already decided upon for next April andsuch further increases as might later seem to be warranted in the lightof devaluation.    The possibility v/as mentioned of an increase made inthe latter part of next year related to family income as a whole andequivalent to a 3s, Od, increase across the board;  this would cost 35 million net of tax at existing rates and this figure could of course be further offset by any given amount of &quot;take&quot;.     The precise form whichthis should take needs further thought, but it would fall within the range of family size over and above the first child.     The Chief Secretaryacknowledged the presentational advantages of such a plan but wishedto reserve the Treasury position on it.Proposed Package15,       To sum up, therefore, the proposed social security packagefollowing devaluation v/ould comprise;-(a) An increase in the income limits for rate rebates to restore the original scope of the scheme at an estimated additional cost of 7. 5 million (or possibly  10,4 million) in a full year and effective in May or November for Scotland and April or October for Englandand Yirales,(b) An increase in supplementary benefits of an amount and at atime to be decided later,(c) An increase in family allowances generally of an amount andat a time to be decided.     This to be linked with counterbalancing taxadjustments which would apply also to the family allowance increasesalready authorised for next April,M.S.70, Whitehall, S. 1*7.1,3rd January, 1968.
