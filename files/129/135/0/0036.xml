flS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS GOVERNMENT)C(68) 3665COPY NO.14th February, 1968CABINETIMMIGRATION legislation memorandum, by the AttorneysGeneralAppendix IV to the memorandum by the Home Secretary (C(68) 34)sets out the provisions of the relevant international agreements ordeclarations in respect of which we might be in difficulties if theproposed legislation is passed.2,      To take the first three instruments first, the memorandumstates arguments which we could use if we are accused of a breach, withwhich I generally agree.    The question of ratification of the convention on Racial Discrimination and the Covenant of Civil and Political Rightswill have to be examined in the light of the proposed legislation.    Wehave taken a leading position in support of the Covenant, and failure to ratify it would be unfortunate.    We also have the general argument thatthe persons to be dealt with, although technically our nationals, are not so closely connected with this country that they can be said to ,rbelong&quot;to it.    In the case of the Convention on Racial Discrimination we canargue that the proposed legislation is based on criteria of territorialconnection with the United Kingdom and does not discriminate on grounds of race, colour or national or ethnic origin.3.       In relation to the European Convention on Human Rights, and theFourth Protocol, the position is somewhat different.(a) Article 3 of the Fourt Protocol to the European Convention of human Rights provides that &quot;No one shall be deprived of theright to enter the territory of the state of which he is anational1&apos;.    It would be difficult to argue that refusal of entry to an Asian immigrant as proposed would not be in breach ofthis provision.    But, though we have signed this Protocol, wehave not yet ratified it.(b) Article 8 of the European Convention itself provides that&quot;Everyone has the right to respect for his .... family life ...&quot;It can be contended that refusal of entry to the dependentchild of one parent who is here is contrai*y to this provision.It is possible that the European Commission, in a case now before it, might indeed so hold, though I think there are cogent
CONFIDENTIALarguments to the contrary, e.g. that parents who come herewithout their children have themselves broken up their familylife.    It will however be unfortunate if we legislate at the verytime when this case is before the Commission.    Is there someway, e.g. by giving the Home Secretary a special discretiontied to this provision of the Convention, which would avoid anapparent conflict with the Commission?4,      The position if we were to be held in breach of the EuropeanConvention is as follows.    We have accepted the right of the individualto petition the Commission, and the compulsory jurisdiction of theEuropean Court.    The effect is that the Commission, on accepting a petition referred to it, investigates the case and tries to effect a friendlysettlement.    If it fails in this, it reports to the Committee of Ministerswhether the State is in breach of the Convention.    The case may thenbe considered by the European Court of Human Rights.    The Court may,if it finds the State in breach of the Convention, &quot;afford just satisfaction to the injured party&quot;.    If the matter does not go to the Court, theCommittee of Ministers decides whether there has been a breach, andprescribes the measures the State is to take to remedy It0    J  the Staterefuses to obey the decision of the Court or of the Committee ofMinisters that is presumably an end of the matter.    But to refuse wouldbe a serious step, as the Patties to the Convention have undertaken toaccept as binding the decisions of the Committee of Ministers and of theCourt.5.       That is now the position in relation to the &quot;family life&quot; provisionof Article 8 of the Convention.    As we have not yet ratified the FourthProtocol, we have not yet incurred these obligations in respect of the&quot;right to enter&apos;1 provision.     We would have to consider whether theproposed legislation would not prevent our ratification of it3 or whether we could perhaps make an appropriate reservation.F0Eo J.Lav/ Officers1 Department, W.C.214th February, 1968
