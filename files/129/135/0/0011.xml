SECRET -1 -/ r?-        10/THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY fS GOVERNMENT)QiMLii COPY NO.     gg3rd January, 1968CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE;  POST-DEVALUATION MEASURESFURTHER DEFENCE CUTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for DefenceThere is some common ground in the suggestions put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C(68) 5) and the proposals madeby the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaries (C(68) 7).    In particular,there is general acceptance that we should speed up our withdrawal from East of Suez; that cuts in commitments must precede further reductions in defence capabilities and costs; and that, given all theaction that has previously been taken, there is little chance of furthersignificant defence savings in 1968-69.2.     I strongly support the view that the first step must be to take decisions on reductions in our commitments.    Once these decisions are taken it will take me several months to produce a revised forcestructure.     The decisions that are envisaged will involve changes inthe shape, size, structure and deployment of the three Services atleast as great as flowed from the last major defence review which took many months to complete,    I believe that provided the decisions on commitments are firm and clear, I shall be able to complete a newforce structure within six months.    Such a period, which will be very short for a task of this magnitude, should nevertheless enable me to getthe most economical and cost/effective mix of capabilities andequipments for the new role of the forces in the 70&apos;s.    This task is something which must be done as a whole since individual decisions will have implications which affect the size and shape of all three services.3.     I shall also need time to work out carefully what is the best way in which to adjust our Service manpower to the smaller forces,substantially different in composition from those hitherto planned, towhich we will have run down by about 1972.     Our forces today are allvolunteers on regular engagements and we have to offer careers andconditions of service which appeal to men of skill and spirit.    Wecould do permanent harm to our forces if we handled the rundown ina way which lost their confidence.    The Services have respondedremarkably well to four major changes over the last two years.   I haveno doubt of their willingness to respond similarly to a fifth changeprovided we have time to examine the many vital personnel implications,and to bring them about in as orderly a manner as possible.    For thisreason we must at this stage avoid any firm commitment to, let alonepublic announcement of, new figures for the total strength of the forces and for civilian manpower in the early 1970rs.
4.     Nevertheless, provided that the discussions which the foreign secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary propose to undertake inthe next few days enable us to reach firm decisions on our commitments on 15th January, I believe that the future pattern is alreadysufficiently clear for me to be able then to indicate the order of magnitude of the financial savings on the defence budget which shouldbe achieved and to give one or two examples in broad terms of the major areas in each of the three Services which will be affected bythese economies.5.      Paragraph 27 of C(68) 5 gives a broad bracket of the financialsavings.    It is important that these savings should be put in perspectivewith the economies which have already been made in the defence budget.    The cumulative effect will be very substantial.   A roughpreliminary estimate is that by 1971-72 the defence budget will bedown to about  1750 million (at 1964 pricee) and to  1650 million in1972-73.    This will represent a very significant fall in the percentageof the Gross National Product absorbed by defence.    Moreover, weshall be getting maximum benefit from these savings at a time when our economy should be in a position to restore postponements on thecivil programmes.6.      It is most important that the accelerated rundown in the far east and Persian Gulf should be conducted in as favourable a local political atmosphere as possible if we are to minimise the risks ofmilitary conflict.    This points to the need for urge-nt and realisticaction in the fields of civil and military aid.7.      I believe, therefore, that in the middle of January, weshould aim to annouce;-(a) firm decisions on the bulk of the cuts in our defence commitments overseas;(b) some specific illustrations of the consequent cuts incapabilities and forces which we expect to flow (forexample, an earlier phasing out of the carriers andadjustments to the Naval construction programme,faster rundown of the Army, a decision not to buildthe variable geometry aircraft and reductions in transport aircraft;  cuts in the size of the Ministry of DefenceHeadquarters and in support facilities in this countryand elsewhere);(c) a broad indication of the order of magnitude of thefinancial savings we expect to achieve (though detailsof manpower savings will not be practicable at thisstage).(d) an intention to publish a Summer White Paper on defence giving full details of the changes that will result from a full study of the cuts in our defence commitments.
SECRET A ,1698.     I believe that this approach is the only one that would appearcredible to any serious student of the problem; to do otherwise wouldsmack of panic, cause great difficulty with the Services and certainly be inefficient and probably wasteful.D.H.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1.3rd January, 1968-3-
