document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS GOVERNMENT)C(68) 335th February, 1968CABINETEVIDENCE TO BE GIVEN TO SELECT COMMITTEESMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure todayconsidered the problems raised by the lines of enquiry which the SelectCommittee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration andthe Select Committee on Agriculture propose to follow.It is understood that the Select Committee on the parliamentary commissioner intend themselves to conduct an investigation, includingthe re-examination of Foreign Office officials, into the matter already-covered by the recent report of the Parliamentary Commissioner for administration on the refusal to pay compensation to certain survivorsof the Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp,    In establishing the SelectCommittee on the Parliamentary Commissioner, it was not envisaged that it could in effect retry individual casea already considered by theCommissioner, and although its proposed enquiry is strictly within itspresent terms of reference, the Ministerial Committee are agreed thatit is open to the strongest objection.3.      The Select Committee on Agriculture propose to enquire into theMinistry ls Departmental assessment of food requirements over the nextfew years;  of how far it would be both practicable and in the national interest to increase the proportion of production from home sources;together with the methods of ascertainment of costs of production,returns to producers, and all matters relevant thereto.    They have asked for extensive information covering the very wide issues ofpolicy which arise in this field.      The Ministerial Committee are agreed that considerable restraint will have to be exercised in providing the Select Committee with the information for which they are asking.In addition to the objections of principle to giving information of this sort, its provision would place a substantial burden on the Departmentsconcerned.    (A copy of this Memorandum circulated to the ministerial committee by the Minister of Agriculture is annexed. )4.     The Ministerial Committee were further agreed that it was neither practicable nor desirable to seek to direct the lines of enquiry which could be followed by Select Committees.    The question thereforeis one of the extent to which Ministers should be willing to co-operate with the Committees in furnishing them with information for theirintended enquiries.    In previous discussion the Ministerial Committeecopy no.     65
385were agreed that Ministers should exercise their own discretion infurnishing such Committees with confidential material, bearing in mind the risk that Committees might insist on its publication and the degreeof damage which might result from such publication in any particular case, and exercising special caution in relation to confidential material of a commercial nature.    In view of the number of Departmentsconcerned iri the information requested ihy the Select Committee on agriculture, however, the Ministerial Committee consider thatcollective consideration should be given by the Economic Ministers to theextent to which the information requested can or should be given.5.      Committee Chairmen are already aware that Ministers and departments cannot necessarily undertake to furnish all the information for which they are asksdp but a refusal to prodxice information is bestconveyed at the time and in the context of a specific request when thereason for refusal can be adequately explained,,    If the Cabinet agreethat the confidential information and the attendance of witnessesnecessary tc enable the Select Committee on the parliamentary commissioner to conduct its proposed investigation should be refused,I should myself propose to explain the difficulties to the Committee.As regards the Agriculture Committee, pending consideration by theEconomic Ministers of the extent to which the information requestedshould be given, it is suggested that the Minister of Agriculture should write to the Chairman explaining that more time is required forconsideration by the Government of its provision because of the scopeof the information for which the Agriculture Committee has asked,6.      I seek the agreement of the Cabinet that we should proceed accordingly.R. H. S. C.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1.5th February, 1968-2-
SELECT -COMMITTEE&quot; ON-AGRICULTUREMemorandum -by the Minister jof Agriculture,. Fisheries. and food,    I have had from the Select Committee on Agriculture the linesof enquiry and programme of work which they propose to follow.   Theseare appended to this memorandum.2,    My Permanent Secretary has been formally required by the Clerkto the Select Committee to submit a memorandum by 7th February and,to appear before the Committee on 14th February.    I have asked him the Committ(not to reply before the Cabinet has beenimportant issues that ariseable to consider the, When, last session, the Select Committee examined the effect onjBritish agriculture of acceptance of the general agricultural policy&apos;of the E.E.C., they were examining&apos; the basis of a policy decision which had already been taken.   Now, in pursuing the line of enquirythey have proposed, they will be concerned with matters relating to-future policy formation and with work which in many cases will haveto be done within the Government for the purpose of future decisionBaking.U,    Consideration by the Select Committee of the extent to which^expansion of agricultural production would be in the nationaljintorest would inevitably raise very wide issues of policy involvingSmany other Departments besides the Ministry of Agriculture, and^ultimately the Government itself.5.    In pursuing the more detailed topics which they propose to investigate, the Committee will be asking for economic forecasts of a kind which my Department and others have not in the pastpisclosed.   For example, projections of food requirements and suppliesinvolve forecasts of the rate of growth of personal income and would[reveal the food component in the balance of payments forecasts.aAgain, the practical possibilities of expansion of home agricultureIcannot be considered apart from our international relations or fromJalternative uses of resources.   An enquiry into rewards and incentivesIto secure labour and capital resources for home agriculture raisesphe question of Government expenditure as well as prices and incomes policy.    These are all matters which I and my Department v/ill notable to deal with alone.Issues of this kind arise Immediately on the memorandum which Department has already been asked to provide.    They are likelyI&apos;0 become even more prominent when the Committee opens its publicsemination of officials.I&apos;    I do not think therefore, if the Committee are to go aheadfs they want, that we can avoid telling them that wo shall not be ablefo give them much of the material they will be asking for.   And as is not only I and my Department who are involved, it seems rightpat they should be told this on behalf of the Government.
8,     If this problem is left unresolved until the Committee opentheir public sessions, I see serious risk of our then being accused of refusing to provide the material necessary for the Committee to pursue the line of enquiry which we have left them to choose.9.     Apart from these points of principle the programme suggested,which will be pursued by sub-committees with specialist help, willthrow a very heavy burden of work on my Department and otherDepartments concerned, and give rise to serious staff problems.10.   The decisions we take as regards this Select Committee are bound to create precedents for any future enquiries affecting otherDepartments,11,   I invite my colleagues to consider what advice should begiven to the Cabinet on the points mentioned in this memorandum andin particular on the line to be taken in regard to the Committee&apos;s immediate request for information from my Department,T.P.P.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,Whitehall, S.W.1 .2nd February, 19682.
