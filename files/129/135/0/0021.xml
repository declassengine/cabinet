FLASH CANBERRA TO COMMONWEALTH OFFICETelno 80     12th January, 1968TOP SECRET AND PERSONALFrom Commonwealth Secretary to Prime Minister.Since I am unable to be present at today?s Cabinet I felt I oughtto let you and the Cabinet have a note of my views on the issue at today [smeeting in the light of reactions I have received from CommonwealthGove r nme nt s.2.     All the Commonwealth Governments I have met, andparticularly the Australians and New Zealanders attach critical importanceto F. Ill being included in our general capability.    Any reduction in thenumbers of the origianl purchase would certainly make them feel that thisconfirmed we were concerned purely about European defence and that ourtalk of a general capability was simply a sugar coating for the pill I amasking them to swallow.    I therefore support the Defence Secretary? s paper a summary of v/hich has been telegraphed to me.3.      In every capital I have visited there has been deep concern aboutthe shortness of the rundown now being proposed and the impossibility of singapore making the necessary economic adjustments in the time and ofall four countries being able to readjust their collective defence arrange-ments as quickly as this.    All Commonwealth Governments have expressedstrong views which I have undertaken to convey to the British Cabinet.    Ishould like to do this at Monday&apos;s Cabinet and indeed it is vitally necessarythat I should be known to do so if any kind of confidence in Britain is to bemaintained amongst our Commonwealth Allies in this part of the world.
