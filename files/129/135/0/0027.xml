DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY fS GOVERNMENT)C(68) 2722nd January8 1968COPY NO. 65CABINETS-QNC^RDEx PRODUCTION finance memorandum by the Minister of TechnologyFollowing the Cabinet decisions on 5th January(CC(68) 2nd Conclusions), about the Concorde,. I discussed with the chief secretary, Treasury, the Attorney-General, and the Legal Adviser tothe Foreign Office, the question of the conditions we should seek to agreewith the French Government for continuance of the project beyond the spring or early summer of 1969.2.      We have instructed our officials to prepare a draft letter for meto send to M. Chamant, the French Minister of Transport? expressingour views about the conditions necessary to the success of the project and which, if not reasonably met by mid-1969, might lead ud to conclude that the project should be discontinued.3.     We took the view that the Industrial Expansion Bill should not include, on its publication, the clause authorising the provision ofproduction finance for Concorde, since the additional contingent commit-ment of  125 million might well have been i)l received if it were made public at the very time that public expenditure cuts were being announced.We agreed, however, to propose to the Cabinet that the clause should be restored to the Bill at Committee stage.4.are .(a)The reasons for seeking the powers in the Concorde clause now the initial stages of production have already begun and underinterim arrangements are being financed 100 per cent by direct Government grant (the materials and parts vesting inthe Minister).    We could continue as we have been doing to advance money oil an ad hoc basis as and when required inorder to maintain the programme.    But as preparations for production gain momentum, the extent of our commitmentwill increase to a point when, given the large sums, and inparticular the large contingent liabilities, which will be involved in more permanent arrangements, constitutional practice and proprieties will, in the opinion of the LawOfficers, require that specific legislative powers should betaken.
(b) If we do not seek these powers by a clause in the industrial expansion Bill as we decided earlier, we shall need to havea separate Bill, for which there is no provision in theprogramme,(c) The proposed new powers will allow advantage to be taken ofan agreement in principle by the Ba.nks to contribute up to 25 millions a considerable relief to the Exchequer.    under present powers, it is not possible to provide the guaranteewhich the Banks would require,(d) So long as the existing system of grants continues, it will notbe possible to charge interest to the firms,, and moreimportantly, there is no way of placing an incentive on themto change over to a system in which they share the potentialburden.(e) Under present powers it is not possible to give the companiesadequate cover against the risks of loss (e, g. in the eventof major technical failure) and it is not safe to assume thatth*ay will be prepared to continue with the present interim arrangements much longer.5.      I therefore propose that the necessary powers should be sought by reinstating the Concorde clause in the Industrial Expansion Bill atthe Committee stage.    For tactical reasons I should not propose tomake such a decision known until I have the results of the initial approach to the French.6.     I ask the Cabinet&apos;s agreement to this proposal.A. W. B.Ministry of Technology, S. W. 1.22nd January, 196 8-2-
