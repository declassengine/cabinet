STATEMENT ON THE DEFENCECHAPTER ONEDEFENCE POLICYPreamble1.     The Defence Budget for 1968/69 totals  22?1M.    Incomparing it with the 1967/68 Estimates of  2205M, allowance has to be made for three factors,,   First, in 1968/69, forthe first time since 1949/50,  the cost of Armed Forceshousing will be met entirely from voted, monies;    in 1967/68 13M was provided from housing loan drawings.    Secondly,the current Estimates include  52M for the effect of devalua-tion on our foreign purchases and the cost of stationingforces overseas.    Thirdly, other pay and Thrice increasesduring the year total some  59M.   When allowance is madefor these factors ( 12hM in all), therefore,  the currentEstimates present a decrease of  581 at constant priceson the 1967/68 total.2.     The Estimates do not provide for cancellation payments in respect of the abandonment of the Fill programme.Supplementary Estimates for these will be presented, in due course.3.     Defence Estimates for 1967/68 were about 6.5/0 of the gross National Product.    In 1968/69 this proportion willbe about 6%,h.     As announced in the House of Commons on loth January,1968, HMG have carried out a detailed and searching reviewof the v/hole range of public expenditure as one of themeasures necessary for a radical solution of the country&apos;balance of payments problems.    The financial result ofthe review is that a cut of  1101.1 will bo made on the forecast estimates of 1969/70 and that by 1972/73 theDefence Budget will be reduced by a further  210M -  260M.REVIEW OF DEFENCE POLICYCOENTAL
5c     It has been a fundamental principle of the currentexamination that reductions in capability, whether in termsof manpower or equipment, must be accompanied by reductions in the tasks imposed by the commitments which we requirethe Services to undertake.     We have no intention of allow-ing the situation, which existed in 196h,to occur againwhen, because of the lack of balance between military tasksand resources,  our forces were seriously overstretched,,6.     The major decisions which the Government has taken maybe broadly summarized as follows:a. britain&apos;s defence effort will in future be concentrated mainly in Europe and the north atlantic area.b. We shall accelerate the withdrawal of our forces from Malaysia and Singapore and complete it bythe end of 1971.     We shall also withdraw fromthe Persian Gulf by the same date,c. Service manpower will be eventually reduced bymore than the 75,000 forecast in Cmnd 3357 andthe reduction will be spread over a shorter tlrae0d. The carrier force will be phased out as soon asthe withdrawals from Malaysia., Singapore and thePersian Gulf have been completed,  and the rate ofsome new naval construction will be reduced,e. The Brigade of Gurkhas will be run down to 6000by 1971.f. The order for 50 F111 aircraft will be cancelledand the RAF transport force will be cut0g. Support facilities,  including HQs,  and theMinistry of Defence will be cut.ho     No special capability for use outside europe will be maintained when our withdrawal from singapore and Malaysia, and the Persian Gulf, is complete^
j0     We shall, however,  retain a general capabilitybased in Europe, including the United Kingdom,which can be deployed overseas as in our judge-ment circumstances demand,  including support for United Nations operations.7.     These decisions mean big changes in the role, size and shape of the forces,  their equipment and support.     Itwill take some time to plan all this in detail.     We intend.,therefore, to present later in the year a SupplementaryStatement? in which we shall report progress.      In themeantime, since the end. of &quot;confrontation&quot; in August 1966,we have been withdrawing units from the Ear East;   up tothe beginning of this year, a total of 12,000 service personnel have returned to this country and have beenaccommodated here.     A further 16,000   personnellhave been brought back from South Arabia and elsewhere08.      In November, we announced a cut of  110M on thedefence programme.     The further decisions that have nowbeen taken will not immediately affect the level of defence expenditure in 1968-69,     The savings already announcedwill in fact be offset to some extent by cancellation pay-ments and transitional expenditure.     The remainingchapters of this Statement are primarily concerned with theDefence Estimates for 1968-69, though they occasionallylook forward beyond that year,9.     The Government recognise that the reorganisation ofthe oervices will involve difficult re-adjustments.      Itwill be one of our major aims to reduce individual hard-ship   and to maintain efficiency during the period of transition.     Thereafter, the Goverrimeiit&apos;s intention is toensure that the Services remain cohesive and viable and offer a good career to those who serve in them.10o   The foundation of Britain&apos;s security now,  as for/centuries

A further 18,000   personnellhave been brought back from South Arabia and elsewhere,,8.      In November, we announced a cut of  110M on thedefence programme.

CONFIDENTIAL 288centuries past, lies in the maintenance of peace in Europe.Our first priority must, therefore,  still be to give thefullest possible support to the North Atlantic Alliance,Our contribution will be formidable.     The size and strikingpower of the Royal Navy is, after the US Navy, greater thanthat possessed by any other member of the Alliance,     our army is well-trained and superbly-equipped, and has more recent and varied fighting experience than any other european army.      The Royal Air Force,  equipped with the most moderncombat aircraft, will be second to none in Europe     We shallthus be able to contribute to the security of NATO on a scale corresponding to our efforts to forge closer politicaland economic links with Europe.11,     With our active encouragement, a major step forwardhas been taken in NATO defence planning.      In the light ofthe political,  strategic and economic guidance given by the nato Defence Ministers In May,  the NATO military authoritieshave developed a new strategic concept to replace that of1956.     This new strategic concept was approved in december and reflects our views,  as set out in the Statement on theDefence Estimates 1966 (Cmnd.  2901).     Firstly,  it is recognised that the assessment of the military threat whichthe Alliance faces should take into account the politicalintentions as well as the military strength of the warsaw pact countries.     Secondly,  it is also recognised that weshould receive timely, possibly prolonged, warning of anychange in the political situation that might make war inEurope more likely.     Thirdly, it is now accepted that NATOstrategy should be based on the forces that member countries are prepared to provide.      It is also agreed that, withinthe total resources available to NATO, adjustments should bemade, particularly In the air forces, with the object of extending the conventional phase in order to give more time before the decision to use nuclear weapons has to be taken.The next stage is to draw up military plans and adjust futureforce planning on the basis of the now military concept,CONFIDENTIAL /12*
12.    The approval by NATO Defence Ministers in December ofa NATO force plan for the period up to 1972 completed thefirst stage in the new procedure for establishing NATO forcerequirements for five years ahead.    This change will make it possible to modify future force planning in the light of changing circumstances;    it will also enable countries to plan the force contributions to NATO on a firmer basis.13.    Our NATO and WEU allies have now accepted the move of a brigade of BAOR and a squadron of RAF Germany to the United.Kingdom.   This redeployment is now talcing place.    The brigade,equipped and trained for its NATO role,  will remain under the operational command of C-in-C BAOR and be ready to return toGermany at short notice should the need arise;    it will goto Germany each year for training alongside the other forma-tions of BAOR.    By these steps we shall save over  1+.5M ayear in foreign currency at present rates of exchange.    Butdevaluation of the pound, will increase the foreign exchange cost of maintaining our forces in Germany,   We are,  therefore,discussing with the German Government ways and. means of meeting our stationing costs after the current Anglo-Germanoffset agreement expires on 31st March, 1968.lh.   At their meeting in December, NATO Defence ministers decided to establish a Standing Naval Force, Atlantic, which.,subject to the control of the North Atlantic Council, hasbeen placed under the operational command of SACLANT inpeace-time.    This multi-national force of five or sixfrigates, to which the United Kingdom contributes one,operates in the Atlantic.    The establishment of this forceenables NATO to demonstrate in a more timely and effective way its will and cohesion in the face of a developing maritimethreat.    The first of the British POLARIS submarines willbecome fully operational this year and will then be assigned to NATO.
15.   HMG- attributes the greatest importance to associatingthe non-nuclear members of NATO closely with the Alliance&apos;snuclear planning and thus to strengthening the nuclear inter-dependence of its membersc    The new permanent nuclear planningmachinery in NATO - the Nuclear Defence Affairs Committeeand the Nuclear Planning Group - is designed for this purpose and has now completed its first year!s work.16,   The Nuclear Planning Group has already concluded thatthe Alliance disposes of sufficient strategic nuclear forces and that the plans for employing them are appropriate todeal with the threat to NATO.    It has also agreed that thenumber of tactical nuclear weapons available to the AlliedCommanders in Europe and the Atlantic   is adequate and thattheir disposition should be kept continuously under review.Within this broad framework, a number of highly importantstudies is in hand.   Among the subjects being studied arethe relevance of anti-ballistic missiles to the defence of nato Europe;    role of tactical nuclear weapons in differentNATO conditions;    and arrangements for improving nationalparticipation in military nuclear planning.    European membersof the Alliance are taking the lead in much of this detailedprogramme of work.17.    Because of the importance of the issues involved for thefuture of the Par East and Persian Gulf, the Governmentsconcerned in both areas were consulted by Ministers before we took the final decisions.    We shall continue to discussthe implications of our withdrawal with our friends and allies in these areas.18.   We shall find it necessary to reach a new understanding with the Government of Malaysia about the Anglo-MalaysianDefence Agreement after 1971-    Our force declarations toSEATO will be reduced as our forces are withdrawn from singapore and Malaysia.   We shall, however, maintain our/interest OB.
interest in the stability of the Middle East and the Par East;and one of the ways in which we shall demonstrate this willhe by our continuing membership of CENTO and SEATO,   We shallhonour our commitments to our dependencies and maintain agarrison in Hong Kong sufficient to fulfil our responsibilities -ties oHOME JD^MjCE19.    The Government has decided that in future civil defence preparations should be on a care and maintenance basis.    Sofar as practicable, existing physical assets will be preserved*Civil defence training and planning will continue at theminimum level necessary to preserve knowledge and techniques and to enable more active preparations to be resumed, ifnecessary, without too much loss of ground.    Most of thevolunteer services will be disbanded, but the Royal observer corps will be retained as part of the Warning and MonitoringOrganisation.   The Women&apos;s Royal Voluntary Service will alsobo retained because of its value in peacetime.    Total annualpublic expenditure will be reduced to about  13M in 1968-69?and fall, in later years, to about  7M.HlldX^TARTIRS. 0RG.WA:: SAT LON20.    In the Statements on Defence of 1966 and 1967, we reportedchanges in the higher organisation for defence.    They were designed to give a more effective machinery for policy-making and planning and for managing the unified Ministry of Defencecreated in 196h.   Following the appointment in January 1967of two Ministers of State with functional responsibilities -the Minister   of Defence for Administration and the Ministerof Defence for Equipment - in place of the three singleService Ministers, some further steps have been taken..21.   Military 0rganisation.   The organisation of the Chiefsof Staffs has been improved in two important ways.22.   Firstly, we have appointed a Deputy Chief of the Defence/S t af x  00.
Staff (Operational Requirements).   He is responsible to theChief of the Defence Staff (as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff-Committee) .   His main duty is to produce, in conjunction withsingle-Service staffs, proposals for weapon concepts whichconform to defence policy and strategy.   He also keeps underreview the range of future weapons and equiioment,  so as tomake the best use of available resources, and co-ordinatesstudies of the assessment of proposed weapons concepts andof operational logistics.23.    Secondly, the machinery for policy-making and planninghas been improved.    The system of Joint Planners, devolped in the last war has worked well for many years.    But it was designed to meet circumstances very different from those oftoday.    What is now needed is a staff that is able to concen-trate on the examination of broad policy iss\ies without being diverted by the needs of current operational problems and contingency planning.   We have therefore reshaped theorganisation, separating the responsibility for operations and that for policy and placing one under the ACDS (Operations)and the other under the ACDS (Policy).    The former is responsible for ensuring that operational and contingencyplans are drawn up, examined and kept up to date, and for undertaking and co-ordinating operational studies and jointService exercises;    the latter is responsible for preparingadvice on military policy, both immediate and long-term, forformulating and carrying out military studies concerned with defence policy, including the size, shape and deployment ofthe forces and distribution of resources within the defence programme, and for surveying the whole field of policy and ensuring that the necessary studies are identified, put inhand and followed up.2h.    In the 1967 Statement we announced the setting up ofa Programme Evaluation Group.   This has justified itselfto such an extent that we have decided to bring it into thecentral machinery for policy making.    It will carry out itsCONFIDENTIAL /work ...
COMFSDEMTfAL ^        293work in a wider foruo, more closely linked, within the Chiefsof Staff organisation,  to the staffs concerned with opera-tional and contingency planning.25.    These changes have &quot;been made without any increase in staff numbers.26.   in August 1967,  the responsibilities of the DeputyUnder-Secretaries of State were adjusted so as to providethe Minister of Defence for Equipment with a DUS to help him in dealing with general questions of research anddevelopment, procurement, &quot;production, and sales of defence equipment.27.   At the same time an additional Deputy Under-Secretaryof State was appointed.    He is responsible for co-ordinating the management of all civilian staff employed throughoutthe Ministry of Defence and the Service Departments and for establishing a single civilian management organisation.28.   These changes, too,  involve no increase in staff numbers.    They are part of the general development towards a more unified control of policy within the Ministry.Financial Re-organisation29.   Experience has shown that,  to be fully effective, the functional Ministers require stronger organisational support and. a more direct executive line of command..    We have there-fore decided to take the major step of functionalising controlof defence finance.30.   Although the I96U re-organisation of the Ministry ofDefence brought together under unified control the fourpreviously separate Departments, four Accounting officers have continued to exist in the Ministry of Defence.    ThePermanent Under-Secretary of State has been responsible forthe Central Defence Vote, and each of the three ServiceSecond Permanent Under-Secretaries of State has been responsible for one set of the single Service Votes.    The/Ministry ...
Ministry of Defence has therefore had a federal structure.It has now been decided to streamline this organisation andto bring it into line with the financial responsibilities ofthe functional Ministers.   As from 1st April next, there willbe two functional Second Permanent Under-Secretaries of State,a Permanent Under-Secretary (Administration), who will beresponsible for all the Votes concerned with the functions under the Minister of Defence for Administration., and aPermanent Under-Secretary (Equipment), who will be responsiblefor the Votes concerned with the functions under the Ministerof Defence for Equipment.   The posts of the Second permanent under-Secretary of State (Royal Navy),  (Army),  and (RoyalAir Force) will lapse;    that of Second Permanent Under-Secretaryof State (Defence Secretariat) has also been abolished.   ThePermanent Under-Secretary of State will, therefore, have twoSecond Permanent Under-Secretariat of State responsible tohim, instead of the four instituted in the 196h central organisation of Defence.31 *    Initially, the two functional Permanent Under-secretaries of State will be the Accounting Officers for the relevantparts of the present single-Service Votes.    This is an interim arrangement.   As soon as practicable, a new unified DefenceVote structure will be introduced.    This fundamental changein the Vote structure is an intricate operation,  involving the Treasury, the Comptroller  and Auditor General, and parliament.   We aim to introduce revised Defence Votes by 1st April 1970.    In the meantime, a unified finance organisa-tion is being established within the Ministry of Defence toprovide a common service to the Accounting Officers.32.   This financial re-organisation does not involve - norimply - any departure from the decision to maintain the three separate Services.    The new higher defence structure willprovide for unified control of finance as well as unifiedcontrol of policy, but, as in any large organisation, detailed/management ...
management must &quot;be de-centralised.ServJjse. Boards33.    The three single-Service Boards of the Defence council will therefore continue to he responsible for the day-to-day management of the three Services.    Since the appointment ofthe functional Ministers of Defence, the Service Boards havenormally been chaired by the single Service parliamentary under-Secretaries of State, although the Secretary of state is formally the Chairman of each Board and the Ministers ofState are formally members and take the chair on occasions.This arrangement will continue.3h.   The main effect on the constitution of the Service Boardswill be that the single Service Deputy Under-Secretaries will replace the existing Second Permanent Under-Secretaries as members of their Beards and become responsible, under thePermanent Under-Secretary and the functional Second permanent under-Secretaries, for providing the Board with financial andadministrative guidance.    The functional Second permanent under-Secretaries of State will attend meetings of the board as appropriate.    The arrangement for providing financial andadministrative guidance will thus be similar to the present arrangements for providing political guidance.Changes in Service Board membership35.    Changes will also be made in the composition of ServiceBoards to bring representation on them more into line withtheir current management functions,  and to make economies insenior staff within the Department.    We intend to reducerepresentation at a convenient time to the extent of oneserving officer from each Board.   Functions will be reallocatedso that the remaining Board members will, so far as possible,each have the same responsibilities as the correspondingmembers of the other Service Boards.36.   All these measures - the changes in the Chiefs of staff organisation, the introduction of functional Permanent Under-Secretaries and the changes in the Service Boards - provide/a
a further streamlining of the Headquarters organisationand will improve efficiency and lead to reductions in staff.While single-Service day-to-day management will continue,questions of inter-Service co-ordination and the relation-ship between single-Service matters and defence policy ingeneral will more effectively he taken into account in theformative stages of policy.

DEPLOYMENT, operations and EXERCISESDEPLOYMENT1.   The following is an outline of the deployment of our forces throughoutthe world.UNITED kingdom. Royal Navy. Last year, sea command was reorganised. In the UnitedKingdom a single major operational commander, the Commander-in-ChiefWestern Fleet, now exercises command over a sea area comprising theNorth Sea, the North and South Atlantic Oceans, the Mediterranean, the carribbean and part of the Pacific Ocean. Frigates, submarines and coastalminesweepers on home sea service carry out training, trials and fishery pro-tection. Ships of all classes on general service commissions also spendperiods at home on operations and for refit, leave and work-up. royal marines are based in the United Kingdom for embarkation in H.M. ships or as part of the Army strategic reserve. Operational Fleet Air Armsquadrons are also temporarily based in the United Kingdom while theirparent carrier is being refitted.3. Under a phased programme beginning this year, the naval shore com-mands will be brought under a single Commander-in-Chief ashore. He willbe based in the Portsmouth area. He will control, in addition to his ownarea, three other Flag Officers i.e. Plymouth, Scotland and Northern Ireland,and Medway. He will also superintend certain aspects of shore training and administration throughout the United Kingdom. The responsibilities of the Area Flag Officers will include those now carried out by the AdmiralsSuperintendent of the Royal Dockyards in their areas. The posts of theAdmirals Superintendent will be abolished.4. Army. The following regular Army forces are stationed in the UnitedKingdom: units in the Strategic Reserve, other front-line units and skeletonheadquarters, units engaged in training, public duties and logistic tasks. are organisation of the home command structure will take place on 1 April1968. Most of the field force units and headquarters stationed in theUnited Kingdom, except for the brigade from B.A.O.R., will come undercommand of a new Army Strategic Command. Southern and EasternCommands will be amalgamated to form a new geographical SouthernCommand.  This will save about 750 uniformed and civilian posts.
5. Royal Air Force. This year will see the amalgamation of Bomber and fighter Commands into one large operational formation, to be based in theUnited Kingdom and known as Strike Command. The command will comprise V-bomber, Lightning, strategic reconnaissance and tanker aircraft.The strategic and tactical transport aircraft of Air Support Command will retain, with an increased capacity, their ability to maintain and reinforceunits overseas: and the Commands ground attack/reconnaissance force willcontinue in its main role of supporting the Army. Flying Training andTechnical Training Commands will be merged into a new Training command in June 1968. Signals Command will be replaced by a functionally indepen-dent group No. 90 (Signals) Group within Strike Command in January1969. As soon as the necessary accommodation and communications havebeen provided, Coastal Command Groups will be disbanded, and the Com-mand itself replaced by No. 18 Maritime Group, which will also be in strike command. Because of its specialised and international commitments, the maritime Group will be commanded by an officer of three-star rank. TheSignals and Coastal Command reorganisation is expected to save about500 uniformed and civilian posts. Long-range maritime reconnaissance air-craft, in conjunction with the Royal Navy, will afford protection for our searoutes: and search-and-rescue facilities will cover the country and its coastal waters. Units of the Royal Air Force Regiment, which train in the UnitedKingdom, will provide any necessary protection for R.A.F. formationsoverseas.EUROPE6. Royal Navy. Ships of the Western Fleet operate in sea areas aroundEurope. Ships are earmarked for assignment to the appropriate N.AT.O.command in order to fulfil commitments in the Channel, Eastern atlantic and Mediterranean.7. Army. Ground forces consist of the British Army of the Rhine(B.A.O.R.) and a brigade group in Berlin. B.A.O.R. is organised into acorps of three divisions, each of two brigades, and forms part of the shieldforces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. With the agreement ofour allies we are now stationing a brigade in the United Kingdom. Thisbrigade, equipped and trained for its NA.T.O. role, will remain under the operational command of the Commander-in-Chief, B.A.O.R., earmarked for assignment to NATO, and ready to return to the Continent should theneed arise. It will go to Germany each year for training alongside the otherformations of BA.O.R.8. Royal Air Force. A tactical air force including light-bomber, fighter-reconnaissance, photographic-reconnaissance and air-defence squadrons, isassigned to N.A.T.O. No. 18 Squadron, Wessex helicopters, has returnedto the United Kingdom, but remains earmarked for assignment toNA.T.O. and ready to return quickly to Germany.
MEDITERRANEAN AND NEAR EAST9. Royal Navy. Destroyers, frigates and minesweepers maintain a navalpresence in the Mediterranean, supplemented from time to time by other major units of the Fleet.10. Army. There are small garrisons in Gibraltar, Malta, Libya and Cyprus.In addition, the Army provides 1,000 men (over 20 per cent of the total)in the United Nations force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).11. Royal Air Force. The forces in the area consist of strike, reconnais-sance, and tactical transport squadrons, air-defence units, a Bloodhound 2surface-to-air missile squadron and two R.A.F. Regiment squadrons. Twohelicopters stand by for search and rescue, and a flight of helicopterssupports the United Nations peacekeeping force. A small detachment ofLightnings in Cyprus was replaced in May 1967 by a full squadron (No. 50)of Lightning aircraft.MIDDLE EAST AND GULF COMMAND12. Our land forces in the Persian Gulf (under a unified command, british forces Gulf) consist of infantry supported by artillery, armoured cars and engineers stationed at Bahrein and Sharjah. The Royal Air Force forces inthe Persian Gulf are also based in Bahrein and Sharjah and include ground-attack and fighter-reconnaissance aircraft, tactical transport of both fixedand rotary wing types, and long-range maritime-reconnaissance aircraft. the stations in the Persian Gulf regularly receive detachments of aircraft fromother theatres. Frigates and coastal minesweepers of the Royal Navy are based in Bahrein for operation in the Persian Gulf.FAR EAST COMMAND13. Royal Navy. Ships provided for the Indonesian &quot; confrontation&quot;have been withdrawn. The forces which remain contain most types of warships and fleet auxiliaries. They include one carrier, a commando ship andan assault ship, destroyers, submarines and frigates. These ships operate as required in the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Oceanand undertake patrol duties in the Mozambique Channel. Headquarters 3rdCommando Brigade, 40 and 42 Commandos and 95 Commando LightRegiment Royal Artillery are at present based in Singapore. Royal australian and Royal New Zealand naval ships are attached to and operate with theFar Eastern Fleet.14. Army. All forces sent to the Far East in connection with &quot;confron-tation &quot;, and those units not required for our commitments to S.E.A.T.O.and for the defence of Malaysia, Singapore and our dependent territories havebeen withdrawn from the theatre. The reduction of the Brigade of Gurkhas to10,000 began in October 1967, and, by June 1968, its strength will beabout 12,500 men. This reduction will continue at the same rate, bringing the strength of the Brigade to 6,000 by 1971.   It has been necessary to
reinforce the Hong Kong garrison temporarily by one Ghurkha battalion fromMalaysia. We plan to withdraw our small Gurkha garrison in Brunei by september 1968.[ 15. As stated in the Supplementary Statement on Defence Policy 1967.,, the,G svernment will continue to honour its S.E.A.T.O. obligaiieosThut the forced&apos;declared to specific S.E.A.T.O. plans will be progressively altered in nature andsire. We have informed our S;RAJI?:0.&quot;&quot;^liies of the immediate changestc be made, which wfhenabknjs to reduce our troops and locally employe Ic vilians by ab&amp;utr%^S00 next year. We are examining, in consultation witjh/ usjralia^and New Zealand, the problems which will be created for themby &apos;the-Tednettons in -ouiHJCTeer4evefls&apos;nbJlie^^16. Far East Air Force. The Far East Air Force is composed of unitsof the Royal Air Force, Royal Australian Air Force and Royal New ZealandAir Force. It includes ground-attack, support helicopter, light bomber,photographic-reconnaissance, long-range maritime-reconnaissance, and short and medium range transport squadrons, as well as two squadrons of theRoyal Air Force Regiment.CARIBBEAN AND SOUTH ATLANTIC17.

THE YEAR&apos;S OPERATIONSFAR EASTMalaysia21. Since the end of &quot; confrontation &quot;, the area has remained comparativelyquiet and stable. We completed the withdrawal of our forces from EastMalaysia, with the exception of a few Army and Royal Air Force personnel,in April 1967. The Royal Air Force continued to assist Malaysia with 6Whirlwind helicopters at Kuching ; personnel were also provided to assist in operating the airfields of Kuching and Labuan. The helicopters were with-drawn in November 1967. We expect that no assistance will be needed in east Malaysia after March 1968. Army survey teams have also helped theMalaysians by mapping the remote areas of East Malaysia and North EastMalaya. Royal Engineers are clearing large stocks of bombs and torpedoesleft behind by the Japanese at Penang during the second world war.Hong Kong22. The garrison in Hong Kong supported the local police in operations tobreak up a Communist campaign aimed at intimidating the population,suborning the police and damaging the economy. The resolute behaviour ofour troops did much to sustain the morale and determination of the Colony.The Army assisted the police by cordoning areas to be searched. After aborder incident, in which five Hong Kong border police died, it took over responsibility for the security of the frontier. Gurkha battalions played adistinguished part in these operations and fully maintained their highreputation.23. The terrorists resorted to murder and the indiscriminate use of bombs,killing and injuring innocent civilians. Men of the Royal Army OrdnanceCorps, Gurkha Engineers and Royal Naval fleet clearance diving team, work-ing with experts in the Hong Kong police, neutralised many bombs andbooby traps. Some of them were killed and others wounded, as they carriedout this dangerous task.24. In their internal security operations, the garrison was helped by thecontinual presence of Royal Naval units and visits by Royal Air Forceaircraft on exercises. In May, the presence of a commando ship, with thecommando embarked, helped to sustain public confidence ; in August, Navalhelicopters were used to assist the police in roof-top raids. During periods of tension, the defence forces were further reinforced by units of the RoyalAir Force Regiment from Singapore, which guarded the airfield at Kai Tak.The six Royal Air Force helicopters which were sent from Seletar inSeptember have been used for moving troops, for evacuating casualties, andfor internal security purposes generally.Thailand25. Royal Engineers have been helping the Thai Government with a programme of road-building in the remote North East of the country.  They
will leave shortly, by which time they plan to finish an all-weather road,linked up with the Thai road network.British Solomon Islands Protectorate26. In Guadalcanal, R.A.O.C. ammunition experts examined decomposingammunition left from the second world war and cleared enough of it toenable a start to be made on extending an airfield there.Rhodesia: the Oil Embargo27. Ships of the Royal Navy, supported by ships of the Royal FleetAuxiliary Service, kept up a continuous patrol of the Mozambique Channeloff Beira. Shackleton aircraft of Royal Air Force Coastal Command,operating from Majunga, flew regularly over a wide area, locating andidentifying tankers, and obtaining information for the naval patrols. Thesejoint operations prevented the arrival at Beira of tankers carrying oil forRhodesia.MIDDLE east the Withdrawal from Southern Arabia28. The last elements of our forces left Aden on 29 November 1967 after128 years of British rule. In spite of a very difficult political situation,the final operations by air and sea were carried out without casualties and inperfect order. The withdrawal involved the movement to schedule of about25,000 servicemen and families, and their equipment and stores. The task would have been challenging in any conditions. Its successful planning and execution in a context of military and political uncertainty must be ratedan outstanding success for the Commander-in-Chief and his staffs, and the many others who were concerned.29. Our forces, by their courage, patience, restraint and professional skill,maintained authority against a threat of anarchy that became clear in 1963and reached such proportions that there were 2,600 incidents in Aden Stateand the Federation in the last eleven months.30. The pattern of violence altered during the year. There were fewerclashes up-country, where our troops had an identifiable enemy and wererelieved by the South Arabian Army in July, but terrorist activity in Adenincreased. In the warrens of the Aden townships Sheikh Othman, Ma&apos;allaa,Crater, Tawahi, Steamer Point, Khormaksar no less than 500 incidentsoccurred in August alone. Here the security forces were at a disadvantage.A terrorist was indistinguishable from an innocent bystander until he showedhis colours by flinging a grenade or pistolling a victim. Often he could notbe seen as he sniped, or lobbed mortar bombs, or fired rockets from longrange. Our forces were conducting an internal security operation in themost difficult circumstances. Yet the troops ensured that public order didnot break down.
31. Authority was not maintained without cost. In the period from december 1963 until shortly before the withdrawal, 135 British Servicemenlost their lives, and more than 900 were wounded. Ninety individual acts ofgallantry were recognised by awards of decorations or medals, and 74 royal marines, soldiers and airmen were mentioned in Despatches or earned the queen&apos;s Commendation.32. Royal Marines and Army units operated in intense heat against aprovocative and unrecognisable enemy who was able to take the initiative in all local affrays; yet their spirit did not falter. The tragic events of20th June when British soldiers were shot down on the outskirts of aden and in the Crater district by mutinous Aden police might have dauntedmen of lesser morale. Indeed, many elsewhere seemed convinced that thedissidents had won the day, when our troops abandoned this commercialheart of Aden. But the withdrawal was only temporary ; two weeks later,when things looked blackest, infantry and armoured cars moved back intoCrater and re-established law and order, which was kept until the finalwithdrawal. This highly successful operation affected more than the securityof Crater. It provided the catalyst needed to consolidate the local forces.In re-imposing their authority, our troops encouraged South Arabia&apos;s soldiersand police to combine in asserting their own authority with results that were crucial for the final political settlement and orderly withdrawal.33. Concurrently with these operations, the Army also helped in training the South Arabian Army. A special team was sent from the United kingdom to convert five Federal Guard units to infantry battalions ; and instructorsfrom British units in Aden trained and formed South Arabian artillerybatteries and armoured-car troops. At the same time, the Royal Engineersaided the Federation with a considerable road-building programme andopened up roads and improved communications, despite their being harassedby hostile, gangs. The Royal Air Force gave advice and help with the setting up of the South Arabian Air Force.34. After April&apos;s unprecedented floods, the Services were primarily responsible for restoring normal working of public utilities ; and, again, for maintaining essential services and supplies when the port of Aden was closedf for three months during the Arab-Israeli war. The Royal Corps of Transportsent in port operating units from the United Kingdom, and the Royal Navysupplied food and fuel in its support ships and tankers. The port operatingunits with the Royal Pioneer Corps worked fast and, in the last 22 weeks of operations, loaded or unloaded 61,700 tons of stores and 2,000 vehicles, andhandled almost 10,000 tons of oil.35. Aircrews of all three Services effectively assisted our troops. Ground-attack Hunters of the Royal Air Force gave tactical support to the royal marines and soldiers and the South Arabian Army ; Fleet Air Arm aircraft from the carriers H.M. Ships Victorious and Hermes, and, in the last stages,from H.M.S. Eagle, joined in demonstrations of force over Aden and theFederation. Flelicopters of the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and theArmy Air Corps were a boon to the sweating ground troops, seeking out
dissident gangs, carrying out soldiers to posts on craggy heights, and savinglife by quickly moving casualties to hospital.36. The final withdrawal was covered by a naval task force made up of nine major units of the Fleet and numerous Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels.Six Wessex helicopters of the Royal Air Force, operating from H.M.S. Intrepidand fitted with searchlights and guns, patrolled continuously for five nightsin the area of Khormaksar airfield, from which the last troops departed.Air Support Command flew over one million miles between 5th and 30thNovember and lifted more than 6,000 troops and 400 tons of equipment from Aden to Britain or Bahrein. Every type of transport aircraft was used,including Hercules Squadrons from the United Kingdom and Far East.During this, the largest operation since the Berlin airlift, the Commandmaintained all its scheduled trunk route services to the Far East and theMediterranean.37. Throughout the strenuous period of operations, our forces never relaxedtheir grip of the general situation. Without their skill and grit, it wouldhave got out of control, with results that would have been tragic not least for the people of South Arabia.Botswana38. The infantry company, stationed at Francistown to guard the B.B.C.relay station, was withdrawn on 31 August 1967.Congo39. A Royal Engineer reconnaissance party visited the Congo in June toadvise on the reconstruction of bridges in Oriental Province, north east ofKisangani.Kenya40. In June, when roads were cut off by heavy rains, two Royal Air ForceBeverley aircraft brought in food supplies. In 30 sorties from Eastleighbetween 23rd May and 1st June, they delivered 231 tons of food.MEDITERRANEAN AND THE NEAR EASTLibya41. British forces in Benghazi in co-operation with the Libyan security forces did much to protect British and American lives during the riots on June 1967. The United States Government expressed appreciation of the aid given by the British military and diplomatic personnel in rescuing andevacuating the staff of the American Embassy.Cyprus42. The United Nations peace-keeping force had much success in preventingserious trouble between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, which, as the disturbances that brought on the crisis of November 1967 showed, could
easily lead to war. British Army units continued to play a prominent partin this force, our soldiers behaving with restraint and fortitude, often inextremely trying circumstances. During the crisis, Royal Navy frigates andother vessels stood by in case it should become necessary to evacuate british nationals.43. Royal Air Force helicopters, detached from the United Kingdom toNicosia, continued to support United Nations&apos; forces.WEST INDIES44. Frigates operated off the Bahamas to prevent Cuban rebels from usingsmaller islands as bases. They were also available to assist in the event ofhurricane damage in the Caribbean, and to help with defence, and thepreservation of law and order, in those territories in the area for which we still have responsibilities.SOUTH ATLANTIC45. As in previous years, H.M.S. Protector spent the southern summer months in the Antarctic. She not only performed the duties of falkland islands guardship, but undertook much valuable scientific work and supported the British Antarctic Survey. A S.R.N. hovercraft and naval support partyhave also been sent to the Falkland Islands on trials. In July, H.M.S. Lynxvisited Port Stanley. A squadron consisting of H.M. Ships Kent, Lynx, andArethusa and R.F.A. Olynthus made a series of very successful visits to theeast coast of South America and exercised with the Argentinian and Braziliannavies. Subsequently, H.M. Submarine Opportune carried out a similar visit to the Argentine and Brazil.UNITED KINGDOM46. In June 1967, at the request of the insurers, H.M. Ships Dreadnoughtand Salisbury destroyed and sank the Federal German ship EssbergerChemist, which had been damaged by an explosion ; she was drifting with1,500 tons of highly volatile petro-chemicals aboard and was a danger to shipping.47. In the first quarter of 1967, H.M.S. Valiant visited the Far East. Shecompleted the return passage submerged from Singapore to the UnitedKingdom via the Cape, a distance of about 11,000 miles. H.M.S. Dreadnoughtalso visited the Far East and will be followed by H.M.S. Warspite in early1968.48. Ships and submarines of the Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliariestook part in exercises, national and N.A.T.O., around the British Isles. they also completed a programme of visits. Throughout the year coastal mine-sweepers of the Royal Navy&apos;s Fishery Protection Squadron patrolled theUnited Kingdom&apos;s fishery limits, while frigates of the Western Fleet carriedout fishery protection duties in waters off Norway, Iceland and Greenland.
The extended fishery limits around the coasts of Great Britain have nowbeen in force for four years, and the increase in the Fishery ProtectionSquadron from five to six coastal minesweepers has proved adequate for theincreased task. The Commander-in-Chief, Western Fleet has become respon-sible for frigates employed on fishery protection duties ; this change givesgreater flexibility without diminishing the effectiveness of fishery protection.Minesweepers and minehunters have been engaged on countermeasures work,and in locating and recovering crashed aircraft, sunken craft and explosivestores.49. Permanently-manned staging posts were set up at a number of airfieldson Canadian and United States territory to form the &quot; Westabout&quot; rein-forcement route. Aircraft can now be sent to the Far East by this new routeor by the more convenient standard eastwards route ; both are regularlyused. Two Lightning squadrons were successfully deployed, one to cyprus and one to Singapore. Using the latest in-flight refuelling techniques theLightnings, in company with Victor tankers, reached their destinationsprecisely as planned and were quickly available for the air defence of the surrounding areas. At home, Fighter Command maintained its full alertforce and, where necessary, Lightning aircraft intercepted and identified air-craft approaching the United Kingdom. Coastal Command long-range mari-time-reconnaissance squadrons continued their watch on surface vessels and submarines in sea areas around the United Kingdom and co-operated inN.A.T.O. activities.50. The strategic and tactical transport force of Air Support Commandcarried out routine movements of Service and civilian personnel and freightto and from the main overseas bases. Strategic aircraft flew an average of57 flights monthly, excluding special commitments, such as Ministerialand V.I.P. flights, to world-wide destinations. An average of four aeromedicalflights took place each month from overseas bases. Special tasks includedflying troop reinforcements to Aden and to Hong Kong; the withdrawal ofService families from Aden ; and the movement of evacuees, flown by theU.SA.F. from Jordan during the Arab-Israel war, from Tehran to Nicosia.MILITARY AID TO THE CIVIL COMMUNITY51. In the Statement on the Defence Estimates 1967, we drew attention tothe ways in which the armed forces can be of service to the civil com-munity in time of peace. We said that we were examining how far the scopeof such assistance could be broadened. Within a few weeks, this issue was brought sharply into relief by the Torrey Canyon disaster.52. The Torrey Canyon ran aground on the Seven Stones Rocks with a cargo of 117,000 tons of crude oil. The threat of oil pollution was on a scale which had no precedent anywhere in the world. A full account of the events that followed was published in Cmnd. 3245.53. The armed forces were involved right from the start. They worked in close co-operation with the local authorities ; the police, fire and civil
defence services ; and voluntary organisations. Naval vessels sprayed deter-gent and assisted in attempts to salvage the tanker. Aircraft of the royal navy and Royal Air Force kept a constant watch on the movement of oilslicks at sea and, in the later stages, bombed the wreck to open it up and fire the remaining oil. The Army protected and cleared polluted beaches.54. The size of the effort put in by the Services can be gauged by the follow-ing figures. The Royal Navy employed 25 ships and small craft, with 21strike aircraft and 42 support aircraft; the Army used over 2,000 men withmotor transport, engineer plant and aircraft, some T. &amp; A.V.R. III person-nel helping at weekends ; and the Royal Air Force flew over 1,100 hours in14 types of aircraft.55. The public interest, which the Torrey Canyon story naturally evoked,should not be allowed to overshadow other services which the forcesrendered to the community during the year. Shackletons and helicoptersof Coastal Command and Royal Air Force mountain rescue teams rescued21 Servicemen and 177 civilians 86 seriously-ill civilians were moved to hospital by helicopter. The Services were again called upon when foot andmouth disease broke out with unparalleled virulence last Autumn. About600 soldiers and 100 airmen assisted the Ministry of Agriculture, FisheriesEnd Food to deal with the epidemic. They were mainly employed ondisinfecting buildings and disposing of carcasses. Assistance included the use of a number of R.A.V.C. officers and the loan of 140 vehicles.56. Emergencies of this kind will constantly recur. We are, therefore,preparing to improve the arrangements for helping the civilian community as a normal Service activity, in so far as this is compatible with peace-time training. There are problems still to be solved. Care must betaken, for instance, to ensure that Servicemen are not used on tasks which fall properly within the field of civilian labour ; at the same time, the selection of tasks must be such that soldiers, sailors, and airmen are not used merely as unskilled labour. Such problems are now under discussion between the Ministry of Defence, other Government Departments, and out-side bodies e.g. the T.U.C. and the Confederation of British Industry.THE YEARS EXERCISES57. During 1967, we maintained our policy of taking part in exercises withour allies. The following is a summary of the major exercises in which united Kingdom forces participated:a. N.A.T.O. Six maritime exercises in the Atlantic, North Sea,Western Approaches and Mediterranean, and one Army exerciseinvolving air support.b. CENTO. A maritime exercise in the Persian Gulf, an air-defenceexercise and a search-and-rescue exercise.c. S.E.A.T.O. An air-defence exercise and a maritime exercise in thetreaty area.d. National. Two maritime exercises, one in the Atlantic and one inthe Far East, and four joint Army/Royal Air Force exercises inGermany.
58. During the year, Air Support Command provided airlift for some 260exercises in some 14 different countries. Parachute and air-mobility exercisesin the U.K. are included in this total.N.A.T.O. EXERCISES59. A NA.T.O. exercise in the North Sea and Channel areas, involvingconvoy, minesweeping and naval control of shipping, was held in May, theRoyal Navy making the largest single contribution. The exercise featuredchartered merchant ships in convoy. R.A.F. Shackletons provided thelargest national air effort in anti-submarine offensive operations and in thesupport of shipping against submarine attack. Royal Marines went to norway and the Netherlands on exercises, and a Netherlands unit exercised in this country.60. SACEUR&apos;s Allied Command Europe (A.C.E.) Mobile Force, to whichthe United Kingdom contributes Army and Royal Air Force contingents,held two live exercises during the year, one in Sardinia and the other in greece. The British artillery battery assigned to the A.C.E. Mobile Forcealso carried out cold-weather training in Canada and Norway.61. British Army units have both trained in Germany and held smaller-scale exercises in Canada, the U.S.A., Italy, Norway, Denmark and Belgium.In return, units from all these countries have trained in the United kingdom with British units. The visit by a Norwegian unit was the first since the war of 1939-45.62. Squadrons from Royal Air Force, Germany took part in many alliedexercises and exchanges. They won the night phase of a photo-reconnais-sance competition, in which seven nations participated ; earned a trophy forthe best day-reconnaissance squadron in the Second Allied Tactical AirForce ; and distinguished themselves in strike and air-defence competitionswith Canberras and Lightnings respectively.63. All three Services also contributed at various levels to the regularN.A.T.O. command-post and tactical exercises. Royal Air Force squadronskept their high efficiency ratings in tactical evaluation exercises. Shackletonlong-range maritime-reconnaissance aircraft participated in six exercises,ranging from the North Sea to the Mediterranean.CENTO EXERCISES64. In August 1967, a team from the United Kingdom took part in a tactical study period in Turkey covering part of the CENTO area.65. Canberras of Near East Air Force acted as the attacking force for a successful CENTO air-defence exercise. They have also exercised theLightnings defending the Akrotiri base. Shackletons from the Gulf and the mountain-rescue team of the Near East Air Force took part in the annualCENTO search-and-rescue exercise. In November, naval ships and royal Air Force aircraft participated in the annual anti-submarine andmine countermeasures exercise, which was again conducted by the IranianNavy.
S.E.A.T.O. EXERCISES66. In March, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force units took part in an air-defence exercise ; Shackletons were present for the annual major maritimeexercise in July, but naval units were unable to attend as they were preparing to support the withdrawal of our forces from Aden.NATIONAL EXERCISES67. In October, a major joint exercise of limited war operations was heldby the Commanders-in-Chief Committee (West) for U.K.-based units. Itwas conducted in a training area in Germany. The Army&apos;s 3 Division and38 Group Royal Air Force practised the rapid overseas reinforcement of a force equipped at light scale. VC10 aircraft of Air Support Command andhelicopters from R.A.F. Germany also took part.68. The Western Fleet, with Coastal Command, conducted a major maritimeexercise in the Western approaches and the Gibraltar area in November. Itwas preceded by a large-scale submarine exercise, in which Shackletonaircraft were used in the long-range anti-submarine role ; aircraft of bomber and Flying Training Commands were also employed in the exercise. Shoreheadquarters, manned mainly by the Reserves, were concerned in a seriesof command post exercises, the accent being on the control of merchantshipping in war. In the Far East, a major joint maritime exercise was heldin March, the long-range maritime air requirements being met from the resident Shackleton force. A reduced programme of fleet and amphibiousexercises was undertaken when operational commitments have allowed.69. U.K.-based forces staged many exercises in air-portability to allied and Commonwealth countries in order to maintain their skills and tech-techniques in differing environments. Army units were flown in aircraft ofAir Support Command to Libya, Germany, Norway, France, Denmark andto the Persian Gulf. Royal Marines Commandos were also deployed over-seas. An Army battalion and a Royal Marines Commando from the far east took part in a joint exercise in Australia, and a company visited NewZealand for an exercise. Training took place in Jamaica, British Honduras,Guyana, Kenya, Cyprus, Malaysia and Malta, as well as Canada ; units fromJamaica made a reciprocal visit to the U.K.70. Bomber Command Vulcan squadrons flew two reinforcement exercisesto Malta and two to Singapore, one of the latter by the &quot; West about&quot; route.While in the Far East, part of the Vulcan force moved to Darwin for an australian air-defence exercise. The Victor tanker force conducted regularflight-refuelling exercises with Lightnings of Fighter Command and with theNear East and Far East Air Forces.71. Exercises were also held in the Far East with Naval, Army and AirForce units of the Australian and New Zealand forces.
311MINISTRY OF defence. The numbers employed within the Headquarters on 1 April 1968 areexpected to total about 16,730. This figure is nearly 7,500 less than the headquarters total on 1 April 1964. In spite of the extra work at Head-quarters arising from the planning and execution of far-reaching defence policy decisions, further reductions will be made during the coming year.2. As stated in the Statement on the Defence Estimates 1967, Chapter III,paragraph 2 (Cmnd. 3203), certain staffs, hitherto borne on the HeadquartersVote, are being reclassified. The aim is partly to show the staffs of thefour main Departments of the Ministry in the Defence Estimates with greaterconsistency, and partly to indicate the distribution of staffs in a way which,in some cases, gives a more accurate picture of the costs of the various services shown in the Estimates.3. As a result, about 5,220 staff hitherto shown on Headquarters Voteswill be transferred to the appropriate functional votes of the Navy Depart-ment or to the civilian outstations Votes of the Army and Air Force Depart-ments. These staffs are primarily employed on design, development,production and provision of stores and equipment, and on accounts andaudit. Although some further changes will be made, the majority of the staffs likely to be affected have been reclassified in the 1967-68 and 1968-69Estimates.4. Although the reclassification referred to above increases the number ofstaff to be counted against the total of civilians employed at oustations, this latter total will be reduced during 1968-69 by over 7,300, bringing the totalreductions in outstation civilan staff to about 19,000 since 1 April 1967.higher defence studies5. Reference was made in the Statement on Defence Estimates 1967,Chapter III, paragraph 21 (Cmnd. 3203) to the arrangements concluded with certain universities to appoint an additional lecturer to specialise inthe defence aspects of his discipline. In addition to those already madeat Edinburgh, Oxford (All Souls College) and Southampton, further appoint-ments have since been made at Aberdeen and King&apos;s College (London).6. The first defence fellowships have been awarded. Three Service officersand one civil servant are undertaking a year&apos;s research and advanced studyat universities. Further fellowships will shortly be announced for theacademic year 1968-69.
37. Studies carried out by universities and other outside academic institu-tions can make a useful contribution to the formulation of defence policywithin the Ministry of Defence. Our contacts with these bodies are thereforebeing extended. Machinery has been established in the Ministry toco-ordinate the examination of proposals received from the academic world.We are also organising seminars and conferences to study higher defence policy.8. The need has long been felt for an independent national institute, whichwould examine defence and oversea problems from a U.K. standpoint.Encouragement and support has been given to plans for developing theRoyal United Service Institution to enable it to meet this need. We welcome the initiative taken in this by the R.U.S.I. as an important contribution to improving the understanding of British defence problems.THE ROYAL DEFENCE COLLEGE9. We are making progress in the planning of the new Royal DefenceCollege, establishment of which was fore-shadowed in the Statement onthe Defence Estimates 1967 (Cmnd. 3203), Chapter III, paragraphs 23 and 24.The college will be at Shrivcnham where existing premises will be extended.It will provide for all young officers of the non-technical arms a balancedone-year course based on three main schools applied science and weaponstechnology, political and strategic studies, and economics and management.While this course will be complete in itself, it will also constitute Part I ofa three-year degree course for those young officers who have the ability and the wish either to remain or to return for the further two years.Degrees will be offered at honours or at ordinary level.10. The Royal Military College of Science will be absorbed into theRoyal Defence College as a school of engineering for Army officers whoseduties require them to obtain an engineering degree.rationalisationLOGISTICS11. Aircraft Support. A considerable measure of common logistic supporthas been introduced for certain aircraft used by more than one of theServices ; for example, for Phantoms and Hunters in the Royal Navy andthe Royal Air Force. The overhaul of airframes and third-fine servicingof some electronic equipment for both Naval and R.A.F. Phantoms is tobe undertaken by the Royal Air Force, and a joint team for provisioningPhantom aircraft spares works under Royal Air Force management. TheRoyal Navy undertakes certain servicing of Royal Air Force Whirlwinds.We are looking into the possibility of extending this common logistic support.12. Food. The rationalisation of food supplies under the Naval VictuallingDepartment has proceeded very smoothly. The planned economies in staff,
storage and office accommodation have been made. With the co-operationof N.A.A.F.I., we are conducting in Army Northern Command and in fiveR.A.F. stations trials of alternative methods of supplying food to the services in the United Kingdom in order to discover what scope exists for furtherrationalisation. Results of the trials should be available for evaluationtowards the end of 1968.13. Guided Weapons Support. Common support arrangements have beenagreed for the Sparrow, Sidewinder, Rapier and Martel missiles. For ex-ample, the Army will be responsible for supplying Rapier spares to boththe Army and the Royal Air Force, and a common servicing policy willbe adopted.14. Hovercraft Support. The Navy Department is to take over responsi-bility for base repair and for co-ordinating the provision and procurementof spares for all Service hovercraft.15. Motor Transport. The Army is now providing spares for a numberof types of Service vehicles, and the range is being progressively widened asvehicle spares are given common stock numbers in accordance with theN.A.T.O. system. The Army is now assuming responsibility for repairingall vehicles (other than those within the capacity of individual units); thepossibility of inter-Service assistance in repairs that are normally carried out at unit level is being studied.16. Water Transport. The Navy Department is to become responsible for research, development, design, production and procurement of marine craftfor all three Services, except Army Landing Ships Tank (L.S.T.s), LandingShips Logistic (L.S.L.s) and amphibians. It will also be responsible for major repairs and refits, and the provision, procurement and supply of asso-ciated spares and stores. The Navy Department will also operate andcontrol Army inter-communication craft (e.g. small launches, M.F.V.s usedfor ferrying personnel and stores) where practicable geographically.Detailed schemes for implementing these measures are being worked out.The possibility of the Navy Department^ undertaking training in maritimesubjects for all three Services is also being examined.17. Supply Co-ordination. The aim of the Director General of SupplyCo-ordination is to improve logistics management by developing a commonsupply terminology and common logistic procedures and by standardisingequipment. During last year, the following progress was made:a. About 160,000 new items of equipment and 175,000 items already in Service inventories have been identified with N.A.T.O. stock numbers.b. About 250 defence standards have been completed, and the pre-paration of a further 500 has been put in hand. One of the aims of these standards is to reduce the variety of items stored by listingthose whose use is recommended. Items not listed will drop out ofinventory when no longer required for maintaining existing equipment.c. A single specification for fork-lift trucks for the Services to replace the many single-Service specifications hitherto in force, is being prepared
3under the &quot; master specification authority&quot; scheme.   Other items arebeing studied under the scheme.d. The Directorate of Systems Co-ordination is engaged on a number of detailed studies, in close association with the Service Departments, inorder to rationalise terminology and to evolve common practices and procedures. It will provide support for a Supply Planning Group, whichhas recently been established to foster in the most effective way thedevelopment of the Services&apos; systems of supply along compatible lines.INSPECTION SERVICES18. A special examination has been made of the arrangements for the inspection of chemicals and textiles for defence use. Some re-organisation will be made in order to produce a more economic and efficient service.MEDICAL SERVICES19. The Army Department becomes responsible in 1968 for procuringmedical stores for all three Services. A single medical and dental equip-ment depot is to be established at Ludgershall. This will be operated bythe Army and will open in April 1968.20. It has been decided to set up two joint Service Medical RehabilitationUnits to replace three single-Service facilities. These will be operated by the Royal Air Force.EDUCATION SERVICES21. Studies continue into the most effective and economic way of bringing together certain educational functions hitherto carried out on a single-Service basis (see Statement on the Defence Estimates, 1967, Chapter III,paragraph 20 (Cmnd. 3203)). In particular, the administration of Servicechildren&apos;s schools overseas is being further examined in the light of there-deployment and rundown of the Services.22. Following discussions with the Government of Gibraltar, we are tobuild two new Service primary schools there. These are expected to be opened during 1969.23. University extra-mural departments have continued, through local services Education Committees and the Committee for University Assistanceto Adult Education in the Forces, to give valuable help in the further educa-tion of Service personnel, particularly in international affairs and militaryhistory. A seminar and short course on strategic studies is run for senior officers.
VCOMBAT forces.   The Combat Forces consist of:a. Nuclear Strategic Forces.b. European Theatre Ground Forces.c. Royal Navy General Purpose Combat Forces.d. Army General Purpose Combat Forces.e. Royal Air Force General Purpose Combat Forces./. Air Mobility Forces.Medium Bomber force . In 1968, the main United Kingdom contribution to the western strategic nuclear deterrent will, as hitherto, be the medium bomber force of theRoyal Air Force. But the Royal Navy will begin to take over the rolewhen the first of the Polaris submarines becomes fully operational duringthe year. The two Victor B Mk 2 Blue Steel squadrons will then be with-drawn from service during the second half of 1968.The Polaris force. H.M.S. Resolution, the first of the four Polaris submarines referred to inthe previous paragraph, was accepted into service by the Royal Navy inOctober 1967. She is undergoing her final trials and work-up, which includetest firings off Cape Kennedy. She will be operational in the Spring of thisyear as planned. The second and third submarines, H.M.S. Renown and h.M.S. Repulse, will carry out sea trials later this year, becoming operationalin 1969 ; they will be followed by H.M.S. Revenge in 1970.4. The Clyde Submarine Base, which commissioned as H.M.S. Neptune inAugust 1967, is now supporting not only H.M.S. Resolution but also a squadron composed of Fleet and patrol submarines.5.

31 oEUROPEAN THEATRE GROUND FORCES6. The European Theatre Ground Forces consist of the British army of the Rhine (B.A.O.R.) and a brigade in Berlin. B.A.O.R., which is organised into &apos;a corps of three divisions, each of two brigades, is partof the shield forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. One brigadeis being stationed in the United Kingdom (see Chapter II, paragraph above).EQUIPMENT7. Armoured Regiments. Armoured regiments are continuing to be equipped with Chieftain tanks. Three regiments have been equipped so far. the performance of the tank in service has come well up to the high standardsexpected of it.8. Field Artillery. The re-equipment of the field artillery supporting our ground forces in Europe is now complete. Tactical nuclear support willcontinue to be provided by the Honest John free-flight missile and the 8-inch towed howitzer.9.   Communications.   A semi-automatic, multi-channel trunk system for communications in the combat area will come into operation this year.10. Infantry. Further issues of tracked armoured personnel-carriers will bring infantry battalions in B.A.O.R. to their full entitlement during theyear. Some armoured personnel-carriers in each battalion will be convertedso that 81 mm. mortar or the Wombat anti-tank gun can be fired fromithem, and some will be fitted with a mount from which the general-purpose machine-gun can be used.11. Army Aviation. By the end of 1968, the Sioux helicopters of the headquarters of brigades in B.A.O.R. will be replaced by Scouts, whichhave a greater range and carrying capacity.COST OF EUROPEAN THEATRE GROUND FORCES12. The cost of European theatre ground forces in 1968-69, in terms ofmoney and manpower, is estimated to be:   Service   civilian a. B.A.O.R.b. Berlin.Totals        - ----Totals        --- -royal navy general purpose combatforces13. The naval general purpose combat forces are the ships of the fleet at home and overseas, other than the Polaris Submarines; the Fleet air arm ; the Royal Marines Commandos ; the fleet support ships; the overseasshore bases, dockyards, supply depots, etc.
317COMPOSITION14.  The Fleet contains the following naval general purpose elements:a. Amphibious forcesb. Aircraft carriers and squadronsc. Submarinesd. Cruisers.e. Destroyers and frigates/. Mine countermeasures forcesg. Support and other ships in an emergency, all these forces can be sent, if required, to other theatreseither as reinforcements or to undertake joint operations with the Army andthe Royal Air Force.EQUIPMENT15. A part of the Government^ measures to curb public expenditure, therate of naval new construction, including the nuclear powered hunter/killersubmarine programme, is now being examined in relation to the reducedcommitments which are a consequence of our withdrawal from the far east and Persian Gulf. The eventual rate at which we can build the threenew classes of ship announced in the Supplementary Statement on defence policy 1967 (Cmnd. 3357) will be one of the things that we shall consider in this exercise. The three classes are frigates to succeed the Leanders,destroyers to carry the Sea Dart surface-to-air missile system, and cruisersto follow the converted Tiger Class.   Design work on them is going ahead.16. Aircraft Carriers. The carrier force will be phased out when thewithdrawals East of Suez have been completed. The effect of this earlierphasing out on the carrier refit programme and the naval Phantom aircraft is being urgently examined. H.M.S. Eagle and H.M.S. Hermes will be in commission during 1968.17. Amphibious forces. H.M.S. Intrepid has now joined the Fleet andrelieved H.M.S. Fearless East of Suez. H.M.S. Albion and H.M.S. Bulwarkwill both be in commission during 1968.18. Cruisers. H.M.S. Blake and H.M.S. Tiger are being converted tocarry Sea King helicopters.   It is planned to convert H.M.S. Lion later.19. Destroyers and frigates. The keel of the Type 82 destroyer was laid in November 1967. She is to be launched in April 1969. H.M.S. Fife and h.M.S. Glamorgan have joined the Fleet. Two more County Class ships,H.M.S. Antrim and H.M.S. Norfolk, have been launched and should join the Fleet in 1969.20. Two new Leander Class frigates join the Fleet in 1968, and a furthersix are being built. In addition, it is probable that some existing Leanderswill be modified to carry the Ikara anti-submarine weapon system.
31821. Helicopters. All ships of frigate size and above will carry helicopters.The Wessex Mark 3, with its new anti-submarine weapon system, is now in service with the Fleet. Our anti-submarine forces will be furtherstrengthened in 1969 with the introduction of the Sea King helicopter.Other ships carry the Wasp, which will be replaced by the WG 13 inthe mid-1970s. These aircraft, in addition to their anti-submarine functionwill, if required, be able to carry out reconnaissance and light surfaceattack.   In the latter role they will carry air-to-surface missiles.22. Submarines. The fifth nuclear-powered submarine was laid down inDecember 1967 ; the keel of the sixth will be laid down in October 1968.An order for the first of an improved design was placed in November 1967.23. Mine Countermeasures Forces. Six coastal minesweepers are being converted into minehunters, as an addition to the eight minehunters already in service.24. Survey Ships. The last pair of four new coastal survey ships (Foxand Fawn) will be delivered in April or May. This completes the present plans for modernising the surveying fleet. Two-thirds of its ships are new or have been modernised within the last three years.25. Support Ships. We are examining the future role of support ships in the light of our. reduced commitments overseas. As a result of thereduction in overseas storage ashore, three large tankers have been charteredfrom commercial trade, in order to meet immediate requirements.26. Three small fleet tankers of a new design were ordered in January1968 to replace some of the Wave and Ranger Class tankers. These ships will provide a much better service to the Fleet because of their higher speed ;they will carry not only fuel but a limited quantity of victualling stores.They will be equipped with full facilities, including helicopters, forreplenishing H.M. Ships at sea.27. During 1968-69 the cost of the naval general purpose combat forces, interms of money and manpower, is expected to be:cost of royal navy general purpose combat forces a.

319army general purpose combat forces28. Army general purpose combat forces consist mainly of the ground forces deployed outside Europe to meet our treaty obligations and other commitments; the strategic reserve; and other front-line units in theUnited Kingdom. We have started to implement the plans, which were described in the Supplementary Statement on Defence Policy 1967 (Cmnd.3357), for reducing the size of these forces and for redeploying them. Thereduction of the Brigade of Gurkhas to a strength of 6,000 by 1971 has begun.   The Army will be reduced by 17 major units by early 1970.29. All our troops have left South Arabia ; the garrison stationed in thePersian Gulf will meet our remaining obligations until the end of 1971.The reduction in the Cyprus garrison was completed last year and therewill be a minor reduction in Malta in 1968. The garrison in Libya was reduced earlier this year. In the Far East, reductions in the number oftroops in Malaysia and Singapore will continue until all our forces have left by the end of 1971. Small increases have been made to the garrisons in Gibraltar and Hong Kong. We intend to maintain the strength and effectiveness of the Hong Kong garrison.EQUIPMENT30. The general-purpose machine-gun and the 9 mm. automatic pistolhave been introduced. All infantry battalions are now equipped with the81 mm. mortar. An improved version of the Mobat heavy anti-tank weapon,the Conbat, will be issued to some battalions during the year.31. A limited number of surveillance devices, which give advance warning of intruders and can detect the movement of vehicles and men on foot,are available for use worldwide. Issues will continue of special binocularsand better flares to improve the ability of the soldier to move and fight by night.32. A British designed and developed bridge, which can be transportedby air, is due in service in early 1969. It is constructed of light alloyand is adaptable as a raft, a floating bridge or a dry gap bridge. Theuse of high strength, weldable, light alloy in the manufacture of militarybridging is a new development and represents an important advance in theuse of this material in the United Kingdom.33. Further issues of Scout and Sioux helicopters will continue throughoutthe year. Armed helicopters were successfully used in operations in south arabia. Further trials of the use of helicopters in this role are being undertaken in B.A.O.R. and the United Kingdom.34.   The first issues of Field Artillery Computer Equipment (FACE) willbe made to training units in the United Kingdom.   This equipmentautomatically computes information for command posts and survey sections :it will help to reduce the response time, and improve the accuracy, of support artillery.
320COST OF ARMY GENERAL PURPOSE COMBAT FORCES35. The cost of Army general purpose combat forces in 1968-69, in termsof money and manpower, is estimated to be: m.     Service     civilian a. United Kingdom forces.b. Far East (excluding Hong Kong)c. Hong Kong.d. Middle East.e. Mediterranean./. Caribbean.Totalsroyal air force general purpose combatforces36. The general purpose combat forces of the Royal Air Force compriseall the front-line formations and units, except the medium bomber, transport and tanker forces. They fall into five main categories:a. Air-defence ; ground-attack ; and fighter/reconnaissance.b. Light bomber and tactical reconnaissance.c. Maritime-reconnaissance.d. Headquarters.e. General support.EQUIPMENT37. Air-Defence, Ground-Attack and FighterjReconnaissance. Lightningfighter aircraft are based in the United Kingdom, Cyprus, Germany and singapore. The remaining Javelin squadron is now being withdrawn fromthe Far East.38. Because of development problems, the introduction of the UnitedKingdom Phantom into Royal Air Force service will be delayed for a short time. The training of crews at the Operational Conversion Unit will beginduring the second half of the year, and the first operational squadron willform about the Spring of 1969. The development of the Harrier aircraft(which, with the Phantom, is to replace the Hunter) continues satisfactorily.The aircraft will enter service in 1969-70.39. Royal Air Force Regiment. The short-range Tigercat surface-to-airmissile will enter service this year, thereby making it possible rapidly toprovide low-altitude air defence world-wide. It will make a useful con-tribution to our defences until the Royal Air Force Regiment is re-equipped with Rapier.
32140. Light Bomber and Reconnaissance. As already announced, the order for 50 F 11 IK aircraft, which were to replace the Canberra, has been cancelled. The effect of this decision on the future equipment of theRoyal Air Force is now being studied. Meanwhile, the plan to transferV-bombers to the tactical role, as they are released from their strategic nuclear role, remains in force.41. Maritime Reconnaissance. The long-range maritime-reconnaissanceforce is now fully equipped with modernised Mk 2 and Mk 3 Shackletonaircraft. The development of the Nimrod, which will begin to replace theShackleton Mk 2 in 1969-70, is satisfactory. The flight test programmeinvolving two of these aircraft is well advanced.COST OF ROYAL AIR FORCE GENERAL PURPOSECOMBAT FORCES42. The cost of Royal Air Force General Purpose Combat Forces duringthe year 1968-69, in terms of money and manpower, is estimated to be: m.      Service      civilian a.

Maritime-reconnaissance squadrons ;operational training units ; and asso-ciated stations    ............d. Command and group headquarters ...e. General support including radar, com-munications and other base facilities ...Totalsair mobility forces43. Air mobility forces comprise the strategic transport force; the medium and short-range tactical transport aircraft; support helicopters ; the tanker force ; communications aircraft; headquarters and bases in the UnitedKingdom and overseas ; the Service and joint-user airfields used as stagingposts. The latter now include the facilities on the alternative &quot; West about &quot;route to the Far East.
EQUIPMENT44. Strategic Transport. This force includes Comet 4C, Britannia, belfast and VC 10 aircraft. The United Kingdom bases for this force are Lynehamand Brize Norton. The VC 10 build-up will be completed in mid-1968, andthat of the Belfast in 1969.45. Tactical Transport (Medium-range). By mid-1968, the medium-rangetransport force will have been equipped with Hercules aircraft, all front-lineBeverley and Hastings aircraft having been withdrawn. The force will thenconsist of only two types, the Argosy and the Hercules. The introductionof the Hercules has been a major task of organisation and training, and it isbeing carried out with exceptional speed and smoothness. All operationalconversion training for the Hercules is now undertaken at Thorney Island.The United Kingdom Hercules squadrons are based at Lyneham andFairford: the Fast East Squadron at Changi.46. Tactical Transport (Short-range). All Andover aircraft for the RoyalAir Force have now been delivered, and squadrons have now been re-equipped. All outstanding deliveries of the Wessex will be received earlyin 1969.47. Tanker Aircraft. The equipment of tanker force with the three-pointVictor tanker has been completed.COST OF AIR MOBILITY FORCES48. Included in the air mobility programme is the cost of charteringaircraft for the movement of personnel, families and priority freight of thethree Services to overseas theatres.49.

323RESERVE forces royal naval reserve forces. The composition and functions of the Royal Naval Reserve forces were described in the Statement of the Defence Estimates, 1966, Part II,Chapter V, (Cmnd. 2902).2. To assist with training the voluntary reserves, the 11 Royal naval reserve Divisions each have one coastal minesweeper allocated to them.These vessels are employed on many duties, from training reservists in mine-sweeping to goodwill visits abroad. Last year they all participated in aN.A.T.O. exercise.3. In all, nearly 14,000 officers and 23,000 ratings can be mobilised ; ofthese, over 3,800 officers and 4,400 ratings belong to the voluntary reserves.army reserve forces4. The composition and functions of the new Territorial and Army Volun-teer Reserve (T. &amp; A.V.R.), which replaced the Territorial Army and theArmy Emergency Reserve on 1 April 1967, are as outlined in the statement on the Defence Estimates, 1967, Chapter V (Cmnd. 3203).5. The Government has since decided to reduce home defence to care andmaintenance, so that T. &amp; A.V.R. III will no longer be kept in its present form. Training in the new Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve I and IIhas had an encouraging start. Individual reservists and sub-units from. &amp; A.V.R. II have undergone intensive training with the Regular Armyin Germany, Aden and Singapore. Members of the Special Army volunteer reserve (S.A.V.R.), the successor to the &quot; Ever Ready&quot; scheme of theTerritorial Army, took part in exercises in Cyprus and Malta.6. As stated in the White Paper on the Reorganisation of the ArmyReserves (Cmnd. 2855), units of the T. &amp; A.V.R. I and II are being issuedwith much-improved scales of modern vehicles and equipment, which con-form generally to the standard of those in equivalent Regular Army units.7. The T. &amp; A.V.R. has a strength of about [5,300] officers and [49,300]soldiers.8. Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Associations will, as indicated in lastyear&apos;s Statement on the Defence Estimates, Chapter VI (Cmnd. 3203), be reorganised on 1 April 1968 and reduced in number from 86 to 14.
324royal air force reserve forces9. Royal Air Force Reserve Forces consist of three main reserves: theRegular Reserve, the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, and the RoyalAuxiliary Air Force.10. The Regular and Volunteer Reserves provide a pool to reinforceregular units, and certain officers and men are earmarked for specific tasksin an emergency. The Royal Auxiliary Air Force is composed of threeMaritime Headquarters Units, whose functions are to back up CoastalCommands operational control organisation if an emergency arises.11. Royal Air Force auxiliaries took part in a live exercise in Septemberin the United Kingdom and overseas: they acted as aircraft controllers and operational staffs.12. The Royal Air Force Reserve Forces have a strength of approximately12,300 officers and 71,600 airmen.
325RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  1. Total expenditure on research and development for 1968-69 is estimatedat [ m ]: this figure takes account of the reduction announced imme-diately following devaluation and of the further cut referred to in paragraph48 of the Prime Ministers statement on 16th January, 1968.2. The provision covers work being undertaken in the same fields as lastyear:a. Aircraftb. Guided-Weaponsc. Military spaced. Electronics (other than electronics associated with a, b and c above and e below)e. Ship construction, naval weapons and equipment/. Ordnance, military ground vehicles, Royal Engineer stores, andbiological and chemical defence.An analysis of the estimated expenditure under these headings is given in annex [D].3. As announced in the Supplementary Statement on Defence Policy 1967,a comprehensive review of the research and development programme hasbeen carried out, resulting in a cut of about  30m. in the previously plannedexpenditure for 1970-71. Work is now in hand to establish what furtheradjustments to the programme will be necessary in the light of the PrimeMinister^ statement.4. Subject to any changes that may emerge from the review referred toabove, the main items in the programme for 1968-69 will be as follows:5. Major Projects. Major development projects on which work will becarried out include:a. Jaguar, the Anglo-French strike/trainer aircraft.b. The Spey-engined Phantom aircraft.c.

Shipborne launching and fire-control systems associated withSeadart and other naval guided-weapons detailed above.j.   A submarine command and operator trainer for the Faslane base.11. Other Projects. Work will continue on the improvement of ships&apos;auxiliary machinery, electrical control equipment, supply systems, andnavigational aids: communications systems, including shipborne terminalsfor satellite communications ; sonar equipments and their associated trainers ;and the use of new materials.ORDNANCE, MILITARY GROUND VEHICLE, ROYAL ENGINEEREQUIPMENT AND BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL DEFENCE12. Major Projects. Major development projects, on which work will becarried out, during the year include:a. Computing equipment which will enable the Royal Artillery to engage targets more speedily and accurately.b. A lightweight close-support gun for use by the Royal Artillery.c. A towed medium gun.d. An armoured vehicle-launched bridge and armoured recoveryvehicle and an armoured vehicle for the Royal Engineers, all based onthe Chieftan main batle tank. There will also be continuing develop-ment work on the tank itself.e. a wheeled reconnaissance vehicle to replace the Ferret Scout car./. An amphibious combat engine tractor to provide armoured engineersupport in forward areas and to assist in river crossing.g. A family of airportable tracked armoured vehicles for reconnais-sance, surveillance and fire support.13. Other Projects. Development of minor projects continues in the follow-ing fields:a. Weapons, fire-control and night fighting equipment, ammunition and fuses, mines and explosive equipment, pyrotechnics and surveyequipment. -b. Military ground vehicles, specialist vehicles and trainers, materialshandling equipment, and the adaptation of commercial vehicles formilitary use.c. Royal Engineer equipment, such as bridging ; plant and materials for earth-moving, road-making and airfield-surfacing; electrical general-ing equipment for use in the field ; and equipment for storing and distributing fuel.d. Equipment and procedures for biological and chemical defence.
MILITARY AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING EQUIPMENT14. During the year, steps have been taken to rationalise the short-term requirements for military automatic data processing equipment and to seethat the longer-term military requirements are co-ordinated with similarequipment being developed for the civil market. This should eliminateduplication of valuable resources and lengthen the production runs.MICRO CIRCUITS15. We are encouraging the use of micro-circuits in defence equipmentwherever they are justified, and we are giving greater attention to thestandardisation of these circuits. The stringent defence requirements play a significant part in stimulating the development of British industry. Herewe have tried to strike a balance between the advantage of standardisationand the risk of stifling progress in this rapidly advancing field with too much rigidity.
VSALESorganisation1.   The Statement on the Defence Estimates 1967, Chapter VII, (Cmnd.3203), outlined the new arrangements within the Ministry of Defence for the promotion of sales of defence equipment within the framework of Govern-ment policy. They are working well. Sales of military equipment have in-creased ; we think that they will amount to over  150 million in 1968-69, theMinistry of Defence share being estimated to be about  50 million.2. We were able, as reported in the Supplementary Statement on defence policy 1967 (Cmnd. 3357), to cover nearly the whole of our foreign exchangecosts for 1967. The sale of military equipment to Germany made a bigcontribution. Discussions are taking place with the Federal government about arrangements for 1968-69.3. Contracts awarded or manufacturing arrangements entered into, underthe F 111 offset arrangement, included the production of head-up displayequipment for the U.S. Air Force A7 aircraft (worth 40m. dollars): twosalvage tugs for the U.S. Navy (16m. dollars): eleven mission support air-craft for the U.S. Air Force (5m. dollars): machine tools (3m. dollars):general stores (3m. dollars): and miscellaneous naval and military equipmentworth more than lm. dollars. We hope that, even with the cancellation ofthe order for the F 111 aircraft, these contracts and arrangements will stillstand.4. The absence of the offset arrangement means inevitably that it will bemore difficult to sell defence equipment to the United States, and great effortswill, therefore, be required. But British manufacturers have gained valuableknowledge and experience of the U.S. defence market and of U.S. procure-ment methods and management, which should be of lasting benefit.5. We shall continue to promote the sale of British equipment when theopportunity occurs. We hope that the U.S. Department of Defense willcontinue to advise us of their requirements.sales to germanysales to the united states
sales to other countries6. Orders and enquiries received from overseas during die past years reflect the continued confidence which the forces of other countries have in thequality and value of British defence equipment of all kinds. international competition is fierce ; but the shipbuilding, aircraft, electronics and otherdefence industries have all had considerable success. Great credit is due toall the many firms and establishments concerned.7. Among the countries which the Head of Defence Sales visited during thepast year are France, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Canada, Australia and Iran.These visits have been welcomed by the countries concerned and havegiven encouragement to many British exporters.sale of charts8. Some information about the sale of charts is contained in Chapter VIII,paragraph 77.
VTRAINING AND SUPPORTinitial and specialist training. Technology advances, and the equipment and components introduced intothe Services grow more and more complex. The Services must, therefore,make certain that training methods are fully effective and that every use ismade of modern teaching aids and techniques.2. Co-operation in training between the Services grows closer as the ex-change of ideas and information increases. This is particularly true in thefield of training research. The training staffs meet frequently to discuss andplan studies. Such studies include, for example, electronic maintenance andprogrammed instruction. The Royal Air Force has taken the lead in theformer ; in the latter, all three Services are playing a part. The naval effort is described in the next paragraph. The Army has sponsored several extra-mural studies. The Royal Air Force is producing programmes on manytechnical subjects and hoping to follow up one of the Army&apos;s studies bysupporting research on the use of adaptive trainers at the University ofEssex. Joint-service training is being pursued to the greatest extent thatdiffering operational requirements and trade structures, and the lack ofsuitable premises permit.ROYAL NAVY3. Programmed Instruction. The use of programmed instruction has been further extended. One major programme on arithmetic has been published;and a companion one on English, and several smaller programmes, are almost completed. These were all written by naval personnel. Commercialfirms, with naval technical advice, are producing a programmed book on the&quot; Rule of the Road &quot; at sea and an experimental programme designed toteach machine-tool operation to technicians.4. Training of Artificers H.M.S. Rapid was commissioned in May 1967to provide practical sea and professional training for artificer apprentices.A review of the training of engine-room and shipwright artificers has led toan eight-month reduction in the length of the course; it may prove possibleto reduce the training time for other categories of artificer in due course.5. Upper Yardmen Scheme. The recently-introduced Upper Yardmen(Supplementary List) scheme, designed to give ratings more opportunity forpromotion to officer rank at an early age, is a success. (It in no way super-sedes the arrangements which allow promotion to the general and special duties lists.)
3326. Commonwealth etc. Training. The Royal Navy last year provided over350 courses within the United Kingdom for Commonwealth and foreignofficers and ratings. 120 officers and 180 ratings of the Royal Navy wereserving with Commonwealth and foreign navies on loan and in training teams.army. Last year&apos;s comprehensive review of the Army training organisation hasbeen successfully consolidated. New courses for training all junior in-instructors engaged in the basic training of recruits and for teaching tactics toinfantry sergeants have started. A decision to put the hovercraft trainingof all three Services under the Inter-Services Hovercraft Unit at Gosportwill eliminate duplication.8. 50 rifle ranges and 60 minor training areas throughout the country(about 12,000 acres) are to be given up. Other small areas are to be reviewed again during the next two years. The adequacy of the largetraining areas to meet the needs of the forces in the United Kingdom isunder investigation.9. The A.rmy&apos;s Director of Technical Tiaining, in consultation with theother Service departments and appropriate civil organisations, is institutingmethods of technical training which will improve the training of militarytechnicians and tradesmen. An important aspect is the provision of infor-mation from operational units to ensure that the training is always up-to-date. Studies of parallel developments by allied countries are also provingvaluable. A new course to instruct chief instructors of army schools indesigning a trade training course was instituted in November. This was thefirst of a series of courses which aim to teach the management of tradetraining to commandants and instructors of army schools. The Armytechnical training organisation gives intensive instruction to tradesmen andtechnicians and encourages them to qualify earlier. The thorough groundingthey receive is of considerable value not only during their subsequentmilitary service, but later on in civilian life.10. Commonwealth etc. Training. About 1,000 officers and 900 men from commonwealth and foreign countries attended Army training courses lastyear. 386 officers and 378 soldiers were on loan to 13 Commonwealth and10 other countries to assist in training.ROYAL AIR FORCE11. There are three main centres for training Royal Air Force officers oninitial entry. All cadet entrants to general list permanent commissions,whether destined for general duties (aircrew), for technical duties (engineerbranch), for the secretarial or equipment branches, or for the Royal AirForce Regiment, now take initial training at Cranwell. Graduate and otherdirect entrants to the general duties branch are given their initial training at Church Fenton ; entrants to all other branches (including the Women&apos;royal Air Force and Princess Mary&apos;s Royal Air Force Nursing Service)are trained at Henlow.
3312. Graduate entrants are normally commissioned in the rank of pilotofficer, and their seniority is ante-dated, on first commissioning, to ensuretheir accelerated promotion to flight lieutenant. There were 87 graduateentrants to the Royal Air Force in 1967, or about 8 per cent of the totalofficer entry from all sources.13. Cranwell also provides the basic and advanced specialist training forengineer officers. All officers receive staff and management training at theRoyal Air Force Staff Colleges at Bracknell and Andover ; at the JuniorCommand and Staff School at Ternhill ; and the Management and WorkStudy Training Squadron at Upwood. Correspondence courses lasting twoyears in staff subjects are provided by the Individual Studies School set upin 1966. Successful completion of this course is now an essential qualification for selection for Staff College.14. In October 1967, the first course of technician apprentices completedthree years&apos; intensive training as systems specialists, diagnosticians andservicing co-ordinators. During such training the apprentices can qualify for the Ordinary National Certificate in engineering. On completion oftheir formal training, they spend a further two years as &quot; improver&quot;corporals, gaining practical experience on the systems and equipments forwhich they will be responsible. 18 cadetships and 10 direct entry corn-missions were awarded to the first course of technician apprentices to passout from training.15. Adult entrants receive recruit training and then proceed to basictraining in their trade. Many airmen are able to advance their careers by being selected for further training to increase their knowledge of their trade or to fit them for specialised work.16. The aircraft and electronics trades, whose boundaries have in somecases been found to be too limited, have been reorganised with the aim off affording a broader basic training. The new engineering tradesman isbeing trained to understand the general principles governing the whole ofhis specialisation and to apply those principles to the equipments which heis called upon to maintain. The reorganisation was formally introduced in April 1967.   Assimilation and conversion training is proceeding.17. Some specialist tradesmen have been trained in the United States onthe Phantom aircraft.18. Commonwealth etc. Training. Last year the Royal Air Force heldtraining courses for 950 Commonwealth and foreign personnel from 41countries. Royal Air Force personnel were loaned to other air forces toassist with local training.flying training the ROYAL NAVY19. Fewer fixed-wing pilots are to be trained as a result of paying offH.M.S. Victorious in 1967 and the decision to withdraw H.M.S. Hermesfrom the operational fleet. On the other hand, intensive training will con-
334tinue to produce sufficient helicopter crews to meet the needs of ships carrying helicopters in the fleet. The idea of training specialist pilots for helicopters-copter duties only is proving very successful and economical. Operationalflying training for anti-submarine helicopter crews will include a final period at sea v/ith fleet units embarked in a new Royal Fleet Auxiliary, Engadine.20. Measures to cut down the cost and improve the standards of air-crew under training include further civilianisation of aircraft maintenance in support of the flying tasks and the provision of flight simulators.Simulators are being constructed for the Phantom, Buccaneer 2 and SeaKing aircraft, and also for navigation training.THE ARMY21. The School of Army Aviation, Middle Wallop continues to train allthe officer and non-commissioned officer pilots required by the Army AhCorps, and other arms and corps equipped with light aircraft and helicopters.During recent years approximately 130-140 pilots annually have successfullycompleted the seven-month course, with an average of 185 flying hours,and have been posted to operational units all over the world.THE ROYAL AIR FORCE22. The reduction in the number of front-line squadrons will decrease therequirements for pilots from the Flying Training Schools. Plans have there-fore been made to concentrate basic flying training at three schools insteadof four.23. Advanced training for Commonwealth and foreign pilots is now carriedout by a Hunter flight of dual and solo aircraft, which replaces a similarVampire flight.24. A contract has been placed for building a navigation sinralator foruse in the initial training of navigators. Each of the 10 cubicles of thesimulator will contain a navigator&apos;s console similar to that to be found inthe training aircraft. A digital computer will provide the informationdisplayed on each console, and students will be able to navigate indepen-dently. The new simulator will replace the obsolescent dead-reckoningtrainer, and it will be possible to delete some flying exercises from thesyllabus. Visual flight systems are being incorporated into Vulcan andLightning flight simulators.25. The Royal Air Force needs more and more experienced officers, com-petent to initiate operational requirements and to progress development workon modern aircraft and their associated weapons systems. The introductionof a general duties aero-systems course at the Royal Air Force College ofAir Warfare, Manby, in place of the traditional specialist navigation course,will meet this need. The course, which will last for 50 weeks, will beopen to suitably-qualified pilots, navigators and air electronic officers. Itwill embrace all aspects of present and future aircraft and missile systems.
335COST OF INITIAL, SPECIALIST AND FLYING TRAINING26. The cost in 1968-69 of initial, specialist and flying training the three services in terms of money and manpower, is estimated to be: m.       Service    civilian a. Initial training .........b. Service colleges (some of the collegesprovide professional training)c. Professional, trade and other trainingd. Flying training       .........Totals  ......The above figures cover both instructors and trainees.support planningREVISED WITHDRAWAL PLANS27. The acceleration of withdrawals from Malaysia and Singapore, andfrom the Persian Gulf, and the changes in the future role and equipment ofthe Services, will create a large complex task for those responsible for thesupport of the Services.28. It is too early yet to give any details of the extra measures requiredto ensure that new plans for bringing home our forces, and for reorganisingand reducing them in this country, are smoothly carried out over the nextfew years. Nor is it possible to give any firm forecast of the share of thetotal savings to be made in the defence budget by the early 1970s which willbe attributable to logistic reductions.REDUCTIONS OVERSEAS29. The greatest part of the savings in support will be made overseas as a consequence of our withdrawal from base facilities outside Europe. Muchplanning is still to be done: the first problem will be to match the with-drawal of units with the contraction or closure of barracks, camps, schools,hospitals, repair and storage depots, and other supporting services, and witha programme for the discharge of locally-engaged civilian and locally-enlisted uniformed personnel.&quot;30.    In Malaysia, and Singapore, for example, we shall berelinquishing the naval base facilities, which were developed for ourFleet in the Far East, many army camps, depots and other military installations and several major air stations.    We are still negotiating with the Governments concerned the terms of their disposal.    Feasiblestudies are being carried out to establish whether it is a practical andeconomic proposition to covert the Singapore naval dockyard to acommercial ship repair yardc     Subject to a satisfactory outcome ofthese studies, we would consider giving this development financialort

The scale of the rundown will be much smaller in the persian gulf, but we shall be withdrawing from there some 6,000 Service personnel and giving up the barracks and other support facilities at Bahrain andSharjah.REDUCTIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM31. We cannot at present expect to make reductions in the United kingdom on the same scale or at the same pace. The forces returning from over-seas will require some additional facilities for several years to come forexample extra housing, as explained in Chapter X. The technologicaladvances in ships, aircraft, weapons, and equipment (described in ChapterVI) will continue to impose new and more exacting tasks on the maintenance,repair, and supply services at home. The U.K. base will provide the operational troops for any emergencies outside this country, so that thegeneral military capability which will be retained must be supported byeffective, as well as economical, support facilities. There is a large and continuing task ahead, much of which will depend on the progress made inthe detailed planning of force structures on which we are now embarked.32. But thorough examinations are already in hand. We are already engaged on a comprehensive review of all naval establishments in the UnitedKingdom, and of all naval holdings of stores, weapons, and ammunition,with the intention of rationalising and reducing the support required by thefleet in the 1970s. This will lead to the closure of a number of shore estab-lishments and depots, including those in the Naval Ah Command which will no longer be required when fixed-wing flying has been phased out. TheArmy are working out detailed plans for the future allocation of militarymanpower as a basis for planning eventual reductions in the whole range of army support facilities, including training establishments, schools, pay and record offices, workshops and storage depots. During 1968-69, as a consequence of the Infantry reorganisation announced last year, 13 brigadeor large regiment Headquarters will be replaced by the 5 Headquarters ofthe new Infantry Divisions; and some eventual savings will result.33. The Royal Air Force is combining reductions in front-line and support-ing units with further measures of reorganisation. Their plans will take timeto complete, but at least 10 stations are expected to be reduced between april 1968 and the end of 1970-71.34. The changes in Command structure described in Chapter II will notonly produce economies in themselves, but also increase efficiency and con-tribute to the process of cutting defence overheads in this country. Thepossibility of further changes in structure will be kept under review in the longer-term examination which is now in hand.
35. Improvements in Management. A central feature of all plans to rede-ploy, rationalise or reduce the support of the Services is the major effortnow being devoted to improving the management of all logistic functions.It will produce significant savings in staff and facilities quite apart fromthose resulting from reduced commitments and smaller forces. Subsequentparagraphs report the latest developments in this field. They includechanges in the arrangements for supplying forces abroad, as logistic facilities on the spot are reduced; more economical storage; progress with theintroduction of computers for the R.A.O.C. and R.E.M.E. ; and the instal-lation this year of a computer into each of the four equipment supply depotsof Maintenance Command.. production, repair and supplyorganisation in the united kingdomTHE ROYAL NAVY36. H.M. Dockyards. The process of modernising equipment and of improving organisation continues. Functional management, already estab-lished at Chatham and Rosyth Dockyards and largely complete at Forts-mouth, is being introduced at Devonport. New computers have beeninstalled at each of the three southern yards (and a fourth will shortly beinstalled at Rosyth) to replace earlier punched card equipment used forpayroll and cost accounting. The new machines will not only save staffbut assist management control by means of critical path analysis and similar techniques.37. The Dockyards have a full programme of refitting and production.Devonport is engaged on the major refit of H.M.S. Ark Royal which began in February 1967. H.M.S. Danae was completed in October 1967. A starthas been made on the conversion of H.M.S. Tiger and upon the constructionof a further Leander class frigate. At Portsmouth, the conversion of H.M.S.Blake and the construction of H.M.S. Andromeda (another Leander classfrigate) will be finished during 1968. Chatham Dockyard completed thesecond of three Oberon class submarines for the Royal Canadian navy in June 1967 and will complete the third during 1968 ; the conversion ofH.M.S. Exmouth as a gas-turbine trials vessel will be finished during the summer. The first refit and refuelling of H.M.S. Dreadnought is to beginat Rosyth in April 1968. The programme of modernising frigates and submarines continues.38. Royal Naval Supply and Transport Service. Further steps, bringingeconomies in common administration and staff management, have been takenin the unification of this service.
33839. A lot of practical experience has been gained from the use of &quot; firstgeneration &quot; computers for stock control and stores provisioning, which have at the same time saved some staff and opened the way to other savings of potentially greater significance in inventory costs. In order to exploitstatistical and other advanced techniques more fully, we are studying meansof augmenting or replacing the existing computer systems for general naval,victualling and armament stores by more modern and more powerfulmachines.40. Meanwhile new computers, linked by a data communication network,have been set up during the past year in the stores depots at Faslane, Coul-port, Copenacre and Eaglescliffe to meet the special and novel problemsof supporting the Polaris force.THE ARMY41. Maintenance in the Army of today, which uses a very wide range ofoften highly-complicated equipment, presents formidable problems of organi-sation to ensure that the most efficient use is made of the resources available.The Army has continued its policy of introducing and developing the mostmodern techniques of management.42. Computers. Planning is well advanced for the introduction of a computer of the latest type at the RA.O.C. depot at Bicester. It will ultimately control holdings, enabling them to be adjusted in relation to world-wide stocks and will make it easier for management to focus attentionon the most important and expensive items. It will also analyse the datafed back so as to provide information on the reliability of ammunition.43. As foreshadowed last year, the Royal Electrical and MechanicalEngineers have recently installed a new computer to provide data about theuse and effectiveness of the repair of Army equipment, its serviceability inunits and the consumption of spares, as well as information about the performance and reliability of equipment in the hands of troops. this information will improve day-to-day management, assist design staffs, andguide the development of future equipments.44. Outside Consultants. Studies by outside consultants have facilitatedthe introduction of budgetary control techniques into the supply and repairorganisation to obtain better value for money. These techniques havealready been introduced into several R.A.O.C. depots and R.E.M.E. work-shops and will be adopted in other similar units. Outside consultantshave also reviewed the structure and methods of the Royal Engineers&apos;Resources Organisation.45. Catering Control. The Army Catering Corps Group Headquarters nowruns a group system of catering control, in which administration, pro-visioning, butchery, and the preparation of food are centralised. It is more efficient and economic than the independent unit messing which it replaces.The group system is now being used in Aidershot where 5,000 troops in 17units are fed, and will be extended there in 1970 to 40 units feeding 17,000troops. The Army plan to bring in further group catering schemes else wherein the United Kingdom in the early 1970&apos;s.
33THE ROYAL AIR FORCE46. Further ranges of equipment have been brought under the control ofthe computer at the Royal Air Force Supply Control Centre, Hendon. units are already feeling the benefit of better supply support as a result of thecentralised computer control of stocks.47. Depot Computers. One of the major functions of Maintenance Com-mand is to service, issue and maintain a very broad range of material tosupport the Royal Air Force all over the world. There are at any one timeabout 800,000 different items in store, while issues and receipts run at therate of over 300,000 a month. These items, which range from split pins tocomplete aircraft wings, present obvious problems of storing and handling,as well as of disposing them in coherent and manageable groups withinthe storage areas. Such complex tasks lend themselves to automatic data processing. Maintenance Command is therefore to introduce a computerinto each of its four equipment supply depots during 1968 to take overthe job of recording, identifying and processing demands made on thedepots. The computer will also provide immediate information about the quantities and precise locations of the items demanded. This will not onlysimplify and speed up the collection and despatch of the various consign-ments but will also be much more economical in manpower. We estimate that up to 500 posts can be saved in this way during 1968-69 with further savings in the following year.48. Ready Access. The introduction of computers has also permitted the command to adopt a new approach to the storage of equipment and spares.Items are to be stored and classified in multi-tier racks on the basis of their size and the frequency of demand. The computers will pre-sort the demandvouchers and present them in sequence, so that the stores staff will be ableto collect the individual items in the most economical manner. This change will lead to much more intensive working, to less arduous labour, to bettersupervision and to a marked reduction in the area required for storage. Itis estimated that a further 500 posts will be saved.49. Cost of Production, Repair and Supply Organisation. The overheadcosts in 1968-69 of the production, repair, and supply organisation, in termsof money and manpower, in the United Kingdom are expected to be about[ 160m]. They include those of storage, repair and production establish-ments in the United Kingdom: the costs of similar units overseas areattributed to the combat forces.a. Naval dockyards, etcb.

340war and contingency stocks50. The level of reserves we must hold to meet the demands of war andother contingencies has been reviewed and reduced. Expenditure on thesereserves in 1968-1969 is expected to be about [ 37m].movements51. The movements programme covers the air, sea and surface transportof Service and civilian personnel and their dependents, stores and equip-ment. The pattern and level of movements, both of personnel and freight,will reflect the planned reductions and redeployment of forces, though this may be offset by a greater incidence of short unaccompanied tours overseas.52. Less than 2 per cent of all personnel moved to and from the UnitedKingdom now travel by sea ; the number of single journeys by air isexpected to be about 420,000. Seven years ago almost three-quarters ofall personnel movement to and from the United Kingdom was by sea. Twoyears ago, Air Support Command handled about 13 per cent of the totalnumber of personnel movements. In 1968-69, it will handle 35 per cent bynumber, but its real contribution will be greater than this because it willfly the longer routes to the Persian Gulf and Far East, the shorter routes to north-west Europe being left to charter companies. The Royal Air Force&apos;sVC10 aircraft, which can carry up to 152 passengers, are now flying personnel on the long-distance routes as part of route familiarisation and continuationtraining.53. Reliefs for H.M. ships stationed permanently outside the United King-dom, for all overseas naval shore establishments, and for Royal MarineCommandos travel by air. We expect also to recommission by air certain other ships abroad in 1968-69. This will mean flying out about 2,000personnel and flying home an equivalent number.54. Freight for the routine maintenance of garrisons and stations overseaswill continue to be moved mainly by sea. Air freighting by Air SupportCommand, supplemented if necessary by civil charter, will be used for storeswhich are required for urgent operational and administrative needs, or canbe transported more cheaply by air. More stores, particularly high-costitems, will be moved by air where it is possible to meet urgent requirementsoverseas rapidly and economically.55. Much of the Navy&apos;s sea freight is carried in the Royal Fleet Auxiliaryoverseas store carriers Hebe and Bacchus. In all they make 8 or 9 roundvoyages a year between the United Kingdom and the Far East. TheNavy&apos;s liquid marine fuels are shipped from the refineries to the storage and usage points in Royal Fleet Auxiliary support tankers, supplemented as opportunity offers by fleet tankers. Both types are equipped for replenish-ment at sea.56. Six Landing Ships Logistic (L.S.L.) will be in service during the year.Landing Ships Tank (L.S.T.) are progressively being withdrawn. When notrequired for their primary role in support of operations, these ships are usedfor major training exercises and for other movement tasks.
57. In 1968-69, the total volume of Service sea freight (outward, inward and inter--theatre) should be in the region of 870,000 measurement tons ; about81,000 measurement tens will be carried in Hebe and Bacchus, and about200,000 measurement tons in Army Landing Ships Logistic and LandingShips Tank. The amount of Services freight to be forwarded from theUnited Kingdom to overseas destination by air is likely to be about 8,000short tons.58. Within the United Kingdom, Services freight is moved by rail to themaximum extent possible.59. The closure of the Suez Canal since June 1967 has meant that seafreight for destinations east of Suez has had to be sent by the Cape route,with higher costs and longer transport times, and that some stores, whichwould otherwise have been shipped by sea, have had to be sent by air.COST OF MOVEMENTS60. The total cost of surface movements in the three Services during 1968-69will be about   m. of which some   m. has already beenattributed in the various costs of the combat forces. Included in the formerfigure are: m.a. Movement of personnel by rail     ...      ...      ...      8-2b. Movement of personnel by sea      ...      ...      ...      0-9 (i)c. Movement of freight by rail............      6-9d. Movement of freight by sea............      8-4 (ii)Total    24-4(i) Excludes payments in compensation for cancellation of troopshipcontracts.(ii) Includes amounts for freight shipped in Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels and Army Department logistic shipping.The cost of movements by air is covered by Chapter IV, paragraph 55.communications61. The Controller, Defence Communications Network now discharges his responsibilities through a joint-Service headquarters which was established in June 1967 for the control of the network. The planning of the futurenetworks is based on the assumption that the Royal Air Force and theRoyal Navy will man, operate and maintain the Defence CommunicationsNetwork. The Army will provide the bulk of ground tactical communica-tions including those point-to-point communications required by the RoyalAir Force.
34262. Progress continues with the rationalisation of the communicationsnetworks. The integration of Service communications in Cyprus has beencompleted and, apart from the benefits of increased efficiency, the projecthas produced savings in manpower and running costs estimated to exceed 0-6 m. a year. In the current year, work to rationalise communications in singapore will be put in hand.63. Satellite Communications. As explained in last year&apos;s Statement on theDefence Estimates (Part II, Chapter VI) (Cmnd. 3203), the United states are procuring and will launch for us two satellites.COST OF COMMUNICATIONS64. The cost of communications networks in the United Kingdom for 1968-69 is estimated to be about (  m.). All other expenditure on communi-cations in the three Services is attributed to the costs of the combat forces.meteorology65. The United Kingdom delegation played a prominent role in theproceedings of the Fifth Congress of the World Meteorological Organisationheld in April 1967, when a comprehensive scheme to improve meteorologicalservices throughout the world (known as &quot; World Weather Watch&quot;) was launched. During 1968-71 the United Kingdom contribution to the schemeis expected to be about  2-5m. The Meteorological Office Headquarters,Bracknell has been offered as a regional meteorological centre and a regionaltelecommunications hub. The United Kingdom plans to extend its observa-tional coverage, particularly in ocean areas, to give free training to meteorolo-gists from overseas, to help developing countries and to assist generally inmeteorological research.66. The research activities of the Meteorological Office continue to expand.One of the world&apos;s leading authorities on geophysical fluid dynamics has given up a full professorship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technologyto establish a laboratory in the Meteorological Office in order to study themotions of the atmosphere and other aspects of geophysical fluid dynamics.A successful experiment was undertaken in the United Kingdom satelliteAriel 3 to measure the concentration of molecular oxygen in the atmosphereat levels of about 160 kms. The cloud physics branch formed in 1966 isundertaking, in conjunction with the Royal Radar Establishment, Malvern,extensive studies of rain-producing clouds, using radars, specially instrumentedaircraft and sounding balloons. To find better ways of forecasting rainfall,experiments are being conducted on selected cloud systems around the ScillyIsles where their approach from the west is unaffected by land masses.67. A machine to replace the hand-plotting of weather observations by direct transfer from teleprinter information is under trial. Services to industry are still being extended. A special service of forecasts for buildingsites is now available. Trials have been undertaken of a service to provideregular forecasts to ships at sea to enable them to follow the best route.
34The number of hydrometeorological enquiries has risen steeply in recentyears: one example of work undertaken in response to such enquiries is a study, now well-advanced, of flood-producing rainfall in the Trent basin.68. Arrangements have been made by which suitably qualified scientificofficers joining the Meteorological Office can undertake PhD. work underthe joint supervision of the Office and the Imperial College, London. Afurther exchange of scientists has taken place with the United StatesEnvironmental Science Services Administration.COST OF METEOROLOGICAL SERVICES69. The net cost of meteorological services to the defence budget is estimatedat [  m].   This includes: firstly, the cost of operational servicesdirectly provided for defence purposes, mainly at Royal Air Force stations,at home and overseas: secondly, the cost of meteorological research ; and,thirdly, the net cost of services for the general public and for other civil purposes, including World Weather Watch, after recoveries have been made from certain users, including primarily the Board of Trade in respect ofcivil aviation.lands70. Despite the heavy workload created by the house-purchase programme(see Chapter X, paragraph 1), reorganisation within the Defence LandsService, and the transfer of day-to-day work from Headquarters to local offices, has enabled further reductions in staff to be made. It is estimatedthat, by 1 April 1968, a 16 per cent reduction on the 1964 complements willhave been achieved.works services71. An important element in support is the work carried out by the Ministryof Public Building and Works. The Ministry is responsible not only forthe works services associated with the accommodation programmes referredto in Chapter X but also for those required to maintain operational effective-ness and to make possible the introduction of new weapons and complexequipment. Examples are a new factory for the repair and inspection ofammunition at Kineton and a number of projects to house new computers.The Ministry also undertake a variety of work associated with other pro-gramme elements, e.g. the Polaris submarine base at Faslane and Coulport,new facilities at Chatham Dockyard for refitting and refuelling nuclear-powered submarines, and the improvement of airfields to take new types of aircraft.surveyROYAL NAVY72. Surveying vessels of the Royal Navy carried out hydrographic andoceanographic surveys at home and abroad, with particular attention to
344oceanographical and geophysical observations. H.M.S. Vidal has been operating in the Indian Ocean for most of the year. H.M.S. Dampier com-pleted her final commission in December and is now at Chatham paying offfor disposal after 19\ years continuous surveying on the Far East Station.The three modern Hecki class vessels continued to give reliable service in the rigorous conditions of the North Atlantic: and the six smaller vessels were occupied in surveys on the west and east coasts of the United Kingdom.THE ARMY73. Military survey units at home and overseas continued to providethe maps, aeronautical charts and geodetic data needed by the three Services.Units in Borneo and Aden have been engaged in field surveys for the pro-duction of new maps, in both cases making extensive use of air photography.A British unit is taking part in the United States geodetic satellite pro-gramme, which will improve map and navigational accuracy throughoutthe world. Modern weapons and the navigational aids to be fitted in new aircraft present difficult new problems which will absorb more effort infuture.ROYAL AIR FORCE74. Photographic reconnaissance aircraft of the Royal Air Force, based inthe United Kingdom and in overseas theatres, undertook important aerialsurveys in Europe, the Far East, the Middle East and Africa in 1967. Anumber of beach and tidal photographic surveys were also flown. Furtheroverseas surveys are planned for 1968. More use is being made of colourphotography which has advantages, e.g. for determining the depth of water.hydrography75. The primary function of the Hydrographer of the Navy is to produce a series of about 3,500 navigational charts and associated publications,covering the world, for the needs of the Royal Navy, other defence organisa-tions, and the Merchant Marine. Modern printing machinery, which yieldsa much higher output for each operator, is being introduced into the Hydro-,graphic Department to replace over-age and obsolescent equipment. TheDepartment will thus be able to meet rapidly-growing demands without increasing the number of industrial staff.76. The first of the new charts in the modern format and metric system will be available for overseas areas in 1968 and for Home Waters probablyfrom mid-1970.77. The public sale of charts to British, Commonwealth and foreign navies,and to mercantile marines, is still increasing. Chart sales are running at separately 20 per cent higher than last year. Provision is being made for receipts of  -64m. in current estimates compared with  -526m. in 1967-68. About75 per cent of sales now are to overseas customers.
345summary of other support costs and miscellaneous expenditures78. The total cost in 1968-69 of support functions (other than training, pro-duction and repair) and war and contingency stocks in the United Kingdom, interms of money and manpower, is estimated to-be (      ). This comprises: m      Service      civilian a. Whitehall organisation      ......b. Local administration, movements and tele-communications in theUnited Kingdom (with associatedservices)      ...      .........c. Meteorological services      ......d.

346RECRUITINGAND RE-ENGAGEMENTpublicity1. Expenditure on advertising for recruits to the Services will continue at about [       m].long term prospects for manpower2. To follow up the enquiry referred to in the Statement on the defence estimates 1967 (Chapter IX), we have set up a Defence Manpower StudiesUnit within the Ministry of Defence. It is responsible for co-ordinating man-power statistics ; for examining systematically the managements requirements for manpower statistics, and statistical methods, including computer facili-ties ; and for developing better forecasting techniques ; and for associatedstudies.3. The original enquiry had shown that such factors as the low birth-rate inthe 1950s, the tendency for boys to stay longer at school, and the demandfor higher education could have important consequences for the manning ofthe Forces. The Unit is carrying out further detailed studies into thesematters.4. The Defence Manpower Studies Unit is working closely with Govern-ment Departments, University Departments and other research organisationswith interests in manpower problems. Useful contacts with manpower plan-ning organisations in industry have also been established.STRENGTHS OF THE services.   The strengths of the Services are summarised in the following table:Service	Total Strength (United Kingdom Personnel)		1 January 1967	1 January 1968Royal Navy and Royal Marines.........	97,342	96,015Army.....................	195,697	190,750Royal Air Force    ...............	124,300	121,4146. The manning situation in the medical services gives cause for concern.Recruitment is not keeping pace with requirements and in particular is notcompensating for the outflow.
officer recruitingTHE ROYAL NAVY AND ROYAL MARINES7. Cadetships and Scholarships. 175 cadets entered Britannia Royal NavalCollege, Dartmouth last September. A considerable increase is needed in thenumber of general list cadets entering the engineering specialisation ; moreseamen are also required. Recruiting effort is being directed towards animprovement. 72 Royal Naval and 6 Royal Marines Scholarships, 136 royal naval Reserved Cadetships and 3 Royal Marine Reserved Appointments were awarded during 1967. The number of applications was less than in previous years.8. University Cadetships and Graduate Entry. 14 University cadetshipswere awarded in 1967. This is not as high as the number of awards in theprevious year. It is hoped to do better in 1968. The Royal Navy needsmany more graduate entrants in the seamen and engineering specialisationof the general list.9. Supplementary List. Entries of supplementary list aircrew have been satisfactory. At present the number of suitable applicants is sufficient tomeet reduced requirements. Minor deficiencies in trained strength will persist until about mid-1969.10. The entry of seamen officers into the supplementary list is still adequate.The Navy is trying to obtain more professionally-qualified engineers as wellas young men suitable to train as engineers to graduate standards within theService.11. Instructor Medical and Dental Branches. Sufficient instructor and dental officers were entered in 1966, but more qualified medical officers are wanted.The medical and dental cadetship schemes continue to attract students.12. Royal Marines. Entries of both permanent and short-service officersinto the Royal Marines remain satisfactory. Entry into the Royal MarinesFlying Service List has been discontinued; because of reduced aircrewrequirements, it is expected that all rotary-wing pilots can be provided forthe Fleet Air Arm from the Royal Navy Supplementary List.THE ARMY13. Regular and Short Service Officers. The Army is now up to strength in total numbers of officers, although certain deficiencies remain. For example,there are shortages of junior officers in some technical and specialist corps.14. The Special Regular Commission (which offers 16 years&apos; commissionedservice initially) was introduced in 1967. It replaces the Limited ServiceRegular Commission and offers improved terms of service. We hope that this commission will prove attractive to civilians, to officers serving on short-service commissions, and to serving soldiers of all ages. The annual target for Special Regular Commissions and Short Service Commissions remains at 500.
34815. In 1967 [ ] appointments were made to non-permanent commissions.The intake at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, for September 1967 was201. The numbers for January 1968 were up to requirements. Twentyscholarships were awarded at both the Spring and Autumn competitions, thegeneral standard of applicants being good. 75 boys entered Welbeck Collegein 1967. There were fewer applicants for entry in January 1968.16. University Entry. Under the University Cadetship Scheme, 23 cadet-ships were awarded in 1967 compared with 19 in 1966. The number of graduates who have taken commissions in the combatant branches of theArmy remains between 25 and 30, against the annual target of 76.17. Medical. The number of medical cadets qualifying as doctors reached its highest point in 1967. One-third of the doctors in the Royal ArmyMedical Corps are now ex-cadets. Unfortunately, the recruitment both ofcadets and of qualified and registered doctors has declined, and the numberof voluntary retirements has risen.THE ROYAL AIR FORCE18. Cadetships and Scholarships. Recruitment to the Royal Air ForceCollege, Cranwell in 1967 was generally satisfactory, although a shortfall inthe Spring pilot entry occurred because some of those previously selected for Royal Air Force Scholarships did not reach the required academicstandard. The entry of engineer cadets to Cranwell is now annual: thelast bi-annual entry in Spring 1967 was satisfactory, but the first annual entryin October 1967 was below requirements. The full quota of Royal Air Forcescholarships was awarded in 1967.19. University Cadetships and Graduate Entry. The numbers and quality of applicants for University Cadetships improved. 50 awards were made during the year, 4 more than in 1966, but the total number of Cadets in resi-dence at universities still falls well short of the target. 25 university cadetsand 10 ex-Henlow cadets graduated during the year ; and 52 graduates wererecruited.20. Other Commissions. The requirement for pilots, which has beenreduced, has been met without difficulty, and the improvement in navigatorrecruitment has been sustained. No improvement has been made in recruit-ment to the engineer branch. The number of officers recruited in the othermain ground branches was below the level of a year ago.21. Medical and Dental Branches. 36 medical and 6 dental cadetships were awarded. Only 2 qualified registered doctors were recruited during the year;at the same time, the number leaving the Service short of a full careerhas risen sharply.recruitment of ratings, soldiersand airmenROYAL NAVY AND ROYAL MARINES22. Recruitment is running at the rate of 7,000 a year. This is lower than was desired: in particular, a shortage of recruits for the most highly-skilled
349categories, e.g. artificer and mechanician apprentices, and in the electricalmechanic, engineering mechanic and communication branches, is being experienced.THE ARMY23. During 1967 [ ] male adult soldiers were enlisted into the Army,of whom f ] or [ ] per cent were young soldiers aged 17 to 17J years.This compares with 19,511 (22 per cent young soldiers) recruited in 1966.Adult recruiting during 1967 was running at [ ] per cent below the 1966level. The number of junior soldiers enlisted (ages 15 and 16) also decreasedfrom [   ] to [   ].24. The increase in the number of adults and young soldiers who elected to serve for nine years (as opposed to six years) on enlistment, has been maintained. The figure for 1966 was 50 2 per cent of the total enlisted and for 1967 it was [  ] per cent.THE ROYAL AIR FORCE25. During 1967, 5,161 adult males were recruited into the ground trades,virtually the same result as in 1966 (5,306). Recruiting in the engineering trades was generally satisfactory, but shortages of recruits in the trades ofelectronic mechanic (ground communications), photographers, safety equip-ment worker, gunner, police, supplier, steward, and trade assistants generalpersisted. In addition 609 young airmen were recruited.26. The requirement for engineering technician apprentices was largelymet 790 craft apprentices were recruited in 1967, compared with 533 in1966, but this was only half the requirement. The recruitment of administra-tive apprentices was insufficient.the women&apos;s services27.  Recruitment for the Women&apos;s Royal Naval Services has been good.28. Officer recruiting for the Women&apos;s Royal Army Corps has fallen short of expectations. For Queen Alexandra^ Royal Army Nursing Corps, it is slightly better; the corps is, however, still some [ ] per cent belowrequirement. Recruiting for other ranks of both corps has been down on1966.29. Recruitment for the Women&apos;s Royal Air Force has been satisfactory. Anew scheme has been introduced for recruiting trained state-enrolled nursesand pupil nurses into the Princess Mary&apos;s Royal Air Force Nursing Service.It is too early to assess the likely response.cadet forces30. Naval assistance to the Combined Cadet Force and the Sea CadetCorps in 1967 was on a similar scale to that in 1966. An encouragingincrease in the number of sea cadets joining the Royal Navy again tookplace: the figures rose from 647 to 762.
35031. The total strength of the Array Sections of the Combined Cadet Forceand the Army Cadet Force is 75,500. About 80 per cent of the Army officerentry had served in the Combined Cadet Force ; and the Army Cadet Forceprovided 30 per cent of the boy entry, and 8 per cent of the adult entry, ofthe Regular Army.32. In order to remedy the training deficiency caused by the re-organisationof the Territorial Army, 34 Regular Army training teams have been estab-lished. The majority of the Army Cadet Force detachments, formerlyaccommodated in centres no longer required for the Territorial and ArmyVolunteer Reserves, have been re-accommodated. It is planned to complete their rehousing during 1968-69.33. The total strength of the Air Training Corps and the Royal Air ForceSections of the Combined Cadet Force is 37,000. Former cadets continueto form a substantial proportion of entrants to the Royal Air Force. Acommittee was set up in April 1967 to conduct a fundamental review of theorganisation, administration and training of the Air Training Corps so as toensure that the Corps will adequately meet the needs of the 1970s. Its report is now under consideration.re-engagementTHE ROYAL NAVY AND ROYAL MARINES34. Following measures taken in 1966 to stimulate it, re-engagement has improved, though not to the rate that we would have liked. Much attention is being devoted to further measures to improve it. The rate for men com-completing nine-year engagements has risen from 25 per cent in 1966 to 29per cent in 1967 ; and, for men completing 12-year engagements, from 45per cent in 1966 to 48 per cent in 1967.THE ARMY35. Over the last year considerable effort has been put into re-engagementwithin the Army with satisfactory results. The aim is to push up the present rates in order to cut the demand for new recruits from civil life. During1967 about 77 per cent of all soldiers completing six years&apos; service remained in the Army to serve on to nine years ; of those who have completed 9years, about 55 per cent have remained to serve on for 12 years or more;and of those reaching the 12 years&apos; service point, about 87 per cent are serving to complete the full 22-year engagement. The career prospects of long-serving soldiers have been improved. This should materially help toretain the most suitable soldiers to fill the senior N.C.O. and warrant officerposts, and the important technical and administrative posts in the Army.THE ROYAL AIR FORCE36. The rate of re-engagement increased in the first half of 1967-68, afterthe decline in the previous six months. This was particularly encouraging,as no special incentive had been offered during this period. All re-engage-
merits are now controlled by selection boards. Each trade has a quotacalculated so that careers can be systematically planned. This enables futurepeaks and troughs in the age and rank structure to be avoided, promotionprospects, to be maintained so that they do not fluctuate too widely betweentrades, and skills to be employed to the best advantage. Extensions ofservice continued at the same rate as 1966: they are reasonably satisfactory.
352PERSONNEL AND FAMILYSERVICESmarried quarters and hirings1. Return of Servicemen and their families. The reductions overseas andthe return of a large number of Servicemen and their families to this countryclearly present problems of morale and welfare. The timely provision ofdecent accommodation, to which we have always attached particular impor-tance, is fundamental to the solution of such problems. We have, therefore,taken exceptional measures over the last twelve months to speed up thebuilding programme and to buy housing in the open market. We now aim to purchase over 8,000 houses, an increase of nearly 5,000 on last year&apos;starget. About 6,000 of these have already either been bought or are under negotiation. Almost all the houses will be on new estates, and over half willhave been finished by the Spring. We have also acquired every suitablehiring that we could find. The total cost of the programme is  32-58m.2. At the same time, we are not relaxing our efforts to speed up and expandthe normal married quarters programme.ROYAL NAVY3. The Royal Navy now has over 10,000 married quarters and 2,800hirings in the United Kingdom. About 1,400 quarters were completed during1967-68. The first phase of the new naval housing estate at Gosport, whichconsists of 1,000 houses and flats, built by industrialised methods has cometo an end. The second phase has started ; the construction of a communitycentre and shops will receive high priority. At the same time, close attention is being directed to the social needs of this large estate and the cultivation of a spirit of community.4. About 3,500 more married quarters are planned for the Royal Navy inthe current building programme, on which  4m. will be spent in 1968-69. Asin the past, the requirement for married quarters in the Navy is being kept under close review, in order that future building programmes can be decided in the light of the demand.5. Overseas, no significant programme for building married quarters is planned. We shall rely mainly on hirings to provide family accommodation at a cost of  -4m. in 1968-69.6. Naval requirements under the special programme (referred to in para-graph 1) for housing families returning from overseas are relatively small.
About 100 houses will have been bought by 31 March 1968 ; expenditureon the balance is expected to be  -5m in 1968-69, and the cost ofhirings  M7m.army. On 1 April 1968, the Army will have about 29,500 married quarters. Afurther 2,000 are due to be completed in 1968-69. By the mid-1970s, the requirement in the United Kingdom should have been substantially met.8. Until the reduction and redeployment of the Army has taken place, therewill, owing to the return of troops from overseas, be a temporary requirement,for additional married accommodation. This will be met mainly by thepurchase of houses, and by additional furnished hirings.9. We estimate the permanent building programme in the United kingdom in 1968-69 at  698m. We expect to have bought 3,700 houses by 31 March1968 at a cost of  18T8m. ; the cost of the remainder is likely to be about 10m. in 1968-69. The cost of hirings will be  l-6m.10. Overseas, work is expected to start early in the year on a number ofBritish and Gurkha married quarters in Hong Kong, the cost of which willbe refunded by the Hong Kong Government. Provision is also being madefor a number of married quarters in Gibraltar.11. A new organisation to manage married quarters estates will be intro-duced in 1968. It is modelled on civilian housing management methods,adapted for the special needs of the Army. It will be integrated with localauthority services and will compare favourably with their standards.ROYAL AIR FORCE12. On current assessments, the deficiency in the Royal Air Force long-term requirement for permanent married quarters in the United Kingdom isabout 4,500; this is being made good at the rate of approximately 1,300quarters a year. The permanent building programme in 1968-69 is expectedto cost  65m. We expect to have completed the purchase of 1,700 houses by 31 March 1968 ; purchases in 1968-69 are likely to amount to  F64m.The cost of hirings will be  2-5m.13. Overseas, the Royal Air Force has some 7,000 married quarters and,200 hirings.  The cost of this accommodation in 1968-69 will be  2-7m.BARRACK ACCOMMODATIONROYAL NAVY14.  The programme for bringing Fleet shore establishments up to modernstandards continues within the resources available.   Much remains to bedone to modernise or rebuild barracks and training establishments inparticular.   We aim to complete this by the late 1970s.   Schemes whichhave a total value of  18m. are already going ahead; others are in an advanced stage of planning.
354THE ARMY15. Accommodation for personnel, depots, schools of instruction, etc., con-tinues to be modernised or replaced to meet the needs of the Army in theUnited Kingdom. In 1968-69,  19-lm. is allowed for this work, including provision for starting 8 personnel accommodation projects. Ten suchprojects are due for completion in 1968-69.16. Work will continue on the renovation of various temporary campsrequired in the short term to accommodate troops returning to the UnitedKingdom.17. Expenditure overseas on new and improved accommodation will include l-8m. for work in BA.O.R.ROYAL AIR FORCE18. Temporary single accommodation will continue to be replaced bypermanent accommodation as necessary ; and the programme modernisingthe older types of permanent barrack blocks is going ahead. The construc-tion of domestic accommodation at West Drayton in connection with theJoint Military and Civil Air Traffic Control project will be well under waythis year.COMPENSATION FOR DEPENDANTS INJURED THROUGHTERRORIST OR SIMILAR CRIMINAL ACTIVITYOVERSEAS19. A scheme for paying compensation to the dependants of Servicemenand other Crown servants who are injured overseas as the result of terroristor similar criminal activity overseas, came into force on 24 July 1967.FUTURE REVIEWS OF FORCES&apos; PAY20. The last general review of the pay of the armed forces took place in1966 when, following the recommendations of the National Board for prices and Incomes, the Government decided to grant increases with effect from1 April 1966. The Government have now made the pay and allowances of the Forces the subject of a standing reference to the National Board, whowill keep them under continuous review. The Board&apos;s first report underthese arrangements is expected to be made early this year.MANPOWER EFFECTS OF RUNDOWN21. The detailed plans that had been worked out following the reductionsannounced in the Supplementary Statement on Defence Policy, 1967 arenow being revised to take account of the accelerated rundown announced on 16 January 1968. It is not yet possible to be precise about the numbersthat will be declared redundant in 1968.
35522. The redundancies will as far as possible, be met by voluntary applica-tions from officers and men in the prescribed age and rank zones, but somecompulsory selection will be necessary where there are not sufficient suitablevoluntary applications.RESETTLEMENT23. Most men leave the Forces at an age when they must look for asecond career in civil life. We recognise that it is important for them to beprepared in advance for resettlement and to be given advice, training ifwhat they have received in the Service has not fully fitted them for civilianemployment and help in finding jobs, when the time comes for them toleave the Service. Such assistance is given through the Forces ResettlementService. This is run by the Service Departments, the Ministry of Labour,and the voluntary organisations that cater specially for the employment of ex-officers and of former sailors, soldiers and airmen.24. Advice is given, mainly at personal interviews, well in advance of thedate of the man&apos;s leaving the Service. It deals with every side of thereturn to civilian life, e.g. housing and, particularly, the choice of employ-ment and training courses.25. Many Servicemen acquire skills which have an accepted value in civilian life. Over a period of years, arrangements have been made withprofessional bodies and with the trade unions to recognise Service qualifica-tions. Men are also encouraged to study to obtain qualification for civilianappointments. For example, one course, which lasts two years, leads tothe Higher National Certificate in Business Studies. Another on systemsanalysis has recently been introduced. The courses are financed partly from public funds and partly by the individual.26. The Forces also offer short pre-release courses in a wide variety of technical and general subjects for those who want training at the end oftheir service. These may be taken either at a Forces Resettlement Centre orby attachment to select firms where appropriate. The courses may be complete in themselves, or they may be preliminary to the post-releasecourses at Government Training Centres. They are run by the Ministry ofLabour, and ex-servicemen are eligible to take them. Short pre-releasecourses in business training and for potential supervisors in industry are provided under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour.27. Help in finding men jobs to match their qualifications is given throughthe Ministry of Labour Employment Services, the Officers&apos; Association, theNational Association for the Employment of Regular Sailors, Soldiers and airmen, and the Services&apos; own resettlement organisations. At each employ-ment exchange (of which there are about 900) and at each regional office,a Minister of Labour official has a special responsibility for ex-members ofthe Forces.28. Now that we have decided to accelerate the rundown of the Forces,we have to examine very closely the adequacy of current arrangements inthe new situation.  A committee of officials from the Ministry of Labour
356and Ministry of Defence is reviewing resettlement arrangements and con-sidering where they need strengthening. The Regional Resettlement Com-mittees set up for the 1957-62 rundown are being reactivated where necessary. The Ministry of Labour are increasing the number of Govern-ment training centres and taking steps to speed up the allocation of ex-Servicemen to vacancies on courses.(309141)
