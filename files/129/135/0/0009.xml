Iff DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)PUBLIC EXPENDITURE;  POST-DEVALUATION MEASURESCIVIL SERVICE STAFF NUMBERS (NON-INDUSTRIAL)Memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerGfficials have now completed the first round of discussions onDepartmental estimates of staff numbers at 1st April, 1968, and 1st April,1969.    I suggested that we should aim in the first instance at achieving areduction of at least 50 per cent in the overall estimated increase (13, 530)up to 1st April, 1969.    The response has been helpful and we can get fairlyclose to this immediate target.    The provisional revised figures show:(a) An increase of about 240 over previously agreed forecasts up to 1st April, I960 - making an estimated in-post figure of 474, 000.(b) An increase of about 7, 350 in the financial year 1968-69 - making an estimated in-post figure for 1st April, 1969, of 481, 350.    (Thesefigures and others in this note exclude casuals.   Staff on casual orseasonal employment are however included in the three-monthly manpowerreturns from which public statements about the size of the Civil service are taken.     The figure for casuals is normally about 2, 500-3,500 butcan be as high as 5, 000),2.       Even so, an estimated increase of 7, 350 next year must give cause for concern.    If we are to demonstrate mat expenditure in the public sector is under- effective and critical control we must not neglect theneed to limit the growth of the Civil Service and the desirability ofdemonstrating that this, like other forms of expenditure, can be contained.     This is all the more the case since many critics of ahigh level of public expenditure are once again drawing attention tothe continued expansion of Civil Service numbers.     They imply thatnumbers could be substantially reduced without any noticeable effecton events or on Government policies.    This criticism is in many waysmisjudged but we have to be able to meet it and show that we are preparedto make economies in the use of scarce manpower resources,3.       The size of the non-industrial Civil Service (excluding those in thePost Office) has been increasing steadily since 1960-61 when the figure was about 385,000.   Excluding casuals, the increase betv/een 1st October,1964 (when the figure was of the order of 414, 000) and 1st April, 1968, willhave been about 60,000.   Such increases are not of course independent ofthe other activities of the Government;  they are mainly the result of oneof two things :-C(68) copy NO.3rd January, 1968CABINET
&quot;t      jfs 16(a) The increasing need for, or demand upon, existing services.     this can cover activities ranging from the need of the Revenue Departments todeal with an increased number of taxpayers to increased demands for pass-ports or driving tests.    Few Departments which deal with individualcitizens are exempt from pressures of this kind,(b) The introduction of new Government policies.     Those which involve discriminatory action between individuals or organisations(the Betterment Levy, Selective Employment Tax, for example), are particularly labour-intensive.4.       In terms of a staffing policy appropriate to the present situation,therefore, we should seek, as far as is compatible with other considerations,to avoid embarking on activities which will inevitably lead to appreciableincreases in the size of the Service and, where we have to create newactivities, to concentrate on schemes which are the more economicalof staff.    At the same time we have to control new demands for staffresources held to be necessary to cope with the pressure and developmentof existing work,     17e shall only be able to do this if we are prepared toaccept in certain areas of activity a somewhat lower standard of service.Alternatively, we can look at existing policies, consider whether some canbe eliminated and suggest areas v/here some slowing down of effort, with consequential staff savings, could be achieved.5. I set out in Annexes A and B an indication of areas where further economies might be found, Annex A covers a group of relatively smalleconomies, mostly by postponing or delaying work programmes already agreed. Annex B points to staff savings which would be possible as theresult of major policy decisions in areas of expenditure at present underdiscussion.6,       There is also some scope for economy of staff by changes inemployment policy, particularly in respect of auxiliary staff.    Forinstance, and O &amp; M Review team has been considering the use ofmessengers and will report v/ithin the next eight weeks.    If the likelyrecommendations were to be implemented throughout the Service there could be a saving of some 300 posts.    In the same way there are areas for economy in the use of paper keepers and laboratory assistants - afurther saving of 300 could be possible here.7,       The most promising scope for this kind of economy, however,is a major extension of contract cleaning.     There would also be aconsiderable financial saving.    At present office cleaning is divided between contract work and directly employed Civil Service non-industrialstaff.    Contract work is usually much cheaper.    A rigorous and completetransfer to contracts (with a few exceptions only for very special reasons)could reduce Civil Service numbers by up to 5, 000 by end-1969, and saveabout  1^: million a year,    A less rigorous policy could save 2, 500 staff and S.j million or  f million a year.    A reduction of 1, 000-1, 500 by31st March, 1969, is certainly well within realisation.    There wouldbe difficulty with the small but vocal union concerned and a risk ofunfavourable Press comment but this is an economy which in presentcircumstances ought to be made.-2-
8.      I conclude that there are possibilities of substantial economies,some as a result of changed policies, some as a result of delaying workand some as a result of changes in management and employment policies.I also believe that with a willingness to look again for ways of improvingefficiency generally Departments can find further savings, howeverlimited or marginal in some cases,    I propose that v/e should control the size of the non-industrial Civil Service in such a way that the numberof staff at the end of the financial year 1968-69 should not be greater thanthe new estimated in-post figure for 1st April, 1968, of 474,000,    V/we should also make public our intention to do this.    Considerable discipline and self-denial will be needed to achieve this limitation.    The figureproposed assumes that expenditure cuts producing throughout the yearstaff savings of the scale set out in Annexes A and 3 will be made.    it also means that we should be willing to permit further staff increases in any area only for genuinely new work and only if accompanied bycompensating savings elsewhere.9.       I therefore seek agreement to our establishing and announcing the limitation of Civil Service staff numbers proposed in paragraph 8above, using an estimated in-post figure for 1st April, 1968, of 474,000,Our officials would be instructed to settle the manpower forecasts and estimates for 1st April, 1968, to 1st April, 1969, on this basis, taking into account the managerial economies on messengerial and officecleaning work referred to in paragraphs 6 and 7.R..H.
