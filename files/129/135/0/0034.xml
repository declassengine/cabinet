DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)C(68) 3412th February, 1968CABINETIMMIGRATIONviLEOIg LATIONMemorandirff by^the^ecretary^of State for theHome Department _IntroductionWe need, as a matter of urgency, to introduce a Bills-(a) extending immigration control to citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies who do not belong to the UnitedKingdom;(b) restricting the right of entry of dependent children]  and(c) dealing with clandestine immigration and a number ofother minor loopholes.5 P.8fident children and clandestine entry2.      The Ministerial Committee on Commonwealth Immigration has considered these questions and has agreed on the need to legislate aswell as the form which the legislation should take.    It is agreed that, thepresent statutory right of a child under 16 to join either parent in thiscountry should be amended to require, in general, the presence of bothparents here.     This will help to stem the tide of very young immigrants(in 1967 they numbered about 35,000 compared with the maximum of8,500 employment vouchers we were prepared to issue tc adults) andto reduce the welfare problems presented by all-mala households.    Ibelieve tb&amp;sre will be support for this in Parliament and in public., as there will be also for the proposal that we should be seen to be doing all that we can to stop clandestine entry.Uncontrolled entry of citizens of the United. Kingdom and Colonies3.      This is more difficult.     The Home Affairs Committee consideredthe question last October and agreed that the position should be reviewed again early this year.    The Ministerial Committee on commonwealth immigration will be considering on Tuesday, 13th February, rny latestassessment of the situation and mv conclusion that the time has now come to legislate.    For convenience I attach in the Annex a summaryof the facts and relevant background.COPY NO.    &quot;-1-
confidential.       Our best hope of developing in these Islands a multi-racial society-free of strife lies in striking the right balance between the number of commonwealth citizens we can allow in and our ability to ensure them,once here, a fair deal not only in tangible matters like jobs, housing andother social services but, more intangibly, against racial prejudice.    Ifwe have to restrict immigration now for good reasons, as I think we must,the imminent R.ace Relations Bill will be a timely factoi in helping us toshow that we are aiming at a fair balance all round.     Conversely, I believethat the reception of the Race Relations Bill will be prejudiced in manyminds, and support for it weakened, if people think that the numbersentering are unlimited or unreasonably high.5.       In 1967 the number of Commonwealth citizens entering under control of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, and settling here was about 60, 000.    Against this, the uncontrolled entry of Asianimmigration from East Africa was about 13, 600.     The monthly total for January, 1968, was nearly 2, 3c1;  this could mean an annual entry of 20,000 or more.    The difficulty arises principally from our wish tobe fair to these Asians who are undoubtedly suffering from the policy ofAfricanisation adopted by the Kenya Government.    I think, however,that we have to look to the greatest good, and balance fairness to themagainst the need to be no less fair to the many thousands of other commonwealth citizens who cannot come here, though they would liketo do so,6.       The effect of the legislative amendment proposed (Appendix IIIto the Annex) will be that Asians in East Africa and others similarlyplaced will be treated exactly as all other Commonwealth citizens;and it is proposed to allow them a special quota of employment vouchers,thus leaving the scheme untouched in respect of those countries whoalready benefit from it,    I believe that this equality of treatment andour general policy of a fair deal ail round, as evidenced by the forth-coming Race Relations Bill, should be sufficient to show that we arenot dishonouring any of the international obligations referred to inAppendix IV of the Annex.7.       It would be important that the legislation should go throughquickly.     Once a decision to legislate was announced there wouldbe a risk of large numbers trying to come here before the controlcame into operation.Summary8.       I ask my colleagues to endorse the proposals in paragraph 1above.Eg   J.   C oHome Office, S. V7.I.12th February, 1968
ANNEXAsian Immigration from East Africa10    Under the existing control of Commonwealth immigration which was introduced by the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies are subject to the immigration control in the same way as citizens of independent Commonwealth court tries, provided that theyhold e passport issued by or on behalf of the Government of any part ofthe Commonwealth outside the United Kingdom,     Eut they are not subjectto control if they hold a passport issued on behalf of the Government ofthe United Kingdom.     There are something like 15 million people who haveno real connection with the United Kingdom hut who are eligible for theissue of such a passport.    The great majority of these people are alsocitizens of an independent Commonwealth country (dual citizens), and theymay well be in ignorance of their right to enter the United Kingdom free of control.     They have so far shown no desire to come here.     But some-thing like 350,000 hold only citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies.     About 200,000 of these are Asians living in East Africa,nearly all of whom already hold United Kingdom passports.     These peopleretained citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies when the localStates proceeded to independence because they did not automatically obtainlocal citizenship under the law of the new State, and failed to exercisean option during the permitted period following independences     In most cases they no longer have a right to obtain local citizenship, but theState has a discretion to grant it.     (The citizenship position is setout in detail in Appendix i).20     The Asians in East Africa have been coming to the United Kingdom in increasing numbers.     (Full particulars are given in Appendix II0)We first started to keep figures in 1965 when some 6,000 came here.     In1966 the figure was 6,800, but in 1967 it doubled to 135*600.    For thelast siv- months the figures have been running at a level much higher thanin 1966,     The main reason for the increase in the number of arrivalsfrom East Africa appears to be the action taken by the Kenyan Government,in pursuance of their policy of Africanisation-,     In August 1967 anImmigration Act was passed the effect of which is that anyone who is nota Kenyan citizen is liable to be deemed to be unlawfully present in Kenya,irrespective of place of birth or length of residence, and if so deemed
must obtain an &quot;Entry Permit&quot; or be liable to expulsion.     Since the Kenyalaw gives citizenship to people born in Kenya only if one parent was alsoborn there, the effect is to take power to make many people, by order,immigrants in the land of their birth and liable to expulsion.     The firstorder under the Act, requiring applications to be made for Entry Permits,was brought into force before the end of 1967 and it applied to clerical,sales and some factory staff.     Permits so far issued have been validfor periods up to two years and are often accompanied by warnings that theywill be renewed only in exceptional circumstances.     And employers arebeing required to enter into bonds to cover the cost of the passage&quot;home&quot; of the employee and of his dependants (even though they may beKenyan citizens).     A further measure is the Trade Licensing Act 19^7which came into fjrce on 8th January and prevents non-citizens from retail-ing specified goods unless they operate in specified urban areas or obtainlicences to trade.     An approach to President Kenyatta in October 19^7suggested that there was no scope for diplomatic intervention by us, toattempt to moderate the policy of Africanisation.The position in South Yemen3.     While citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies in &amp;ther parts ofthe Commonwealth show no disposition as yet to come here, the position inSouth Yemen must also cause some concern.     Under the citizenship law ofthe Federation of South Arabia people bwrn in Aden, or whose fathers wereborn there, would have become citizens of the new State, and I could havemade an Order withdrawing citizenship of the United Kingdom and Coloniesfrom them.     However, this law is not effectively the law of the new Stateand so in practice there is as yet no local citizenship lav/.     The presentposition is that perhaps one half of the 240,000 inhabitants of Aden could now apply for United Kingdom passports which would exempt them from ourimmigration, control.     There is no present indication that they wish tocome here.     More serious are the indications that when the new government does pass a local citizenship law it is likely to exclude fromcitizenship some 40,000 people who are not of Arab descent (mainlyIndians and Somalis), and these will become an addition to the pool of citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who are exempt from our control.     Numbers of them might in time wish to come here.The form that an extension of immigration control might take4v    The form that an extension of immigration control might take is setout in Appendix III.     Legislation would amend the Act of 1962 so that a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies holding a passport issued onbehalf of the Government of the United Kingdom v/ould be exempt from controlonly if he belonged to the United Kingdom in the sense that he, hisfather or his father&apos;s father had been born, naturalised or adopted inthe United Kingdom or registered as a citizen of the United Kingdom and colonies in the United Kingdom or in a country which was an independent commonwealth country at the date of the registration.     This is theformula that has been adopted in the Independence Acts to define the citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who, although acquiring thecitizenship of the newly independent country, are not to lose their citizen-ship of the United Kingdom and Colonies, and it seems appropriate for thepresent purpose.     It v/ould render subject to our immigration control notonly people of Asian descent in East ^ifrica, the South Yemen and South-east asia, but also citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies of the third and later generations born in foreign countries who had retained theircitizenship through registration with a consul;   for example, the Britishcommunity in the Argentine.- 2 -
394The arguments for an extension of immigration control5.     The strongest argument for extending our control to include theexempt citizens of the United Kingdsm and Colonies is perhaps the straight-forward one that they have no greater claim on merits to settle in theUnited Kingdom than have Commonwealth citizens living in independent commonwealth countries or citizens of the United Kingdom and Coloniesliving in colonies.    The full extent ef the problem was by no meansrealized when the Act of 19^2 v^as passed.   In moving the Second Pleadingof the Bill the Home Secretary of the day said that the intention was that control should apply to all those who in common parlance did not belong tothe United Kingdom.   These people have no substantial connection with theUnited Kingdom and, the question of citizenship apart, it is nat equitablethat they should be admitted freely while we apply rigorous control to all those who live in the independent Commonwealth countries, and tc the citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who live in colonies.   Toextend control would not mean that no-^ne would be admitted.   Visitorsincluding business visitors, students, people of independent means anddependent relatives of people already resident here v/ould be admitted inaccordance with our normal criteria.    In addition, I consider that itwould be reasonable to make an addition to the overall quota of employ-ment vouchers, which is at present 8,500 a year for the whole Commonwealth,so that the inclusion of chese people within the control would not reducethe number of vouchers available fer the rest of the Commonwealth.    Onthe other hand, they should not be given treatment so generous as to attract criticism from the rest of the Commonwealth.    Officials shouldstudy the size of the addition to the voucher total, and make a recommendation.6,     Apart from the question of principle, there is the practical point that the inflow of citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies free ofcontrol, together with those coming in from the New Commonwealth underthe control, is creating serious problems for us, particularly in the schools, in the field of youth employment and in housing.   The combinedtotal of those entering under these two heads increased from 53,000 in1960 to 71,000 in 1967.   As well as placing education and the other services under strain, the existence of this uncontrolled element in the flow is bad for race relations in this country, and makes it less easy for us to justify our rigorous control of entry from the Old Commonwealth.The arguments against an extension of immigration control7.,     However, the argument for extending our immigration control to theexempt citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies is by no means a one-sided one.   The citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies who holds apassport issued by the Government of a colony has an unrestricted rightof admission to that colony.   But the exempt citizens may well have nounrestricted right of entry anywhere.   The East African Governments aretreating them more and more as immigrants, notwithstanding that they mayhave been born in East Africa and lived there all their lives.   If we take away their right of entry to the United Kingdom, it may well be argued that, while we are not leaving them Stateless, we are leavingthem with no more than the husk of citizenship.    Given that these people would not have left India but for the existence of the British Empire, itcan be argued that we have an obligation to accept the consequences,  isother consequences of the end of the Empire.    Further, to deny these people entry to the United Kingdom may be inconsistent with the letter,if not the spirit, of a number of international agreements that we have signed and ratified, or are contemplating doing so.    (Details are givenin Appendix IV.)   The most pertinent appeares to be the EuropeanConvention of Human Rights, Article 3(2) of the Fourth protocol of which- 3 -ii&apos;&quot;oN5TA
CONFIDENTIAL -      395states - &quot;No-one shall be deprived of the right to enter the territory of the State of which he is a national&quot;,,   This convention has enforcement machinery in existence - the European Commission of human Rights., before which Commonwealth citizens have already broughtone or two cases arising under the ;.ct of 1962.    If we extend control to these exempt citizens, it is likely that a case will be brought against us before the European Commission, and we shall have to argue that this Protocol has not been infringed in substance and in spirit,whatever the letter of the law,8.     --part from the question whether the extension of control would bein breacn of specific international agreements is the question whetherit would be in breach of customary international law.   The position isnot clear.    But it would be a breach of international law for a State torefuse to receive its own nationals if they had bec-n expelled by another state of which they v/ere not nationals, and there is some support for the wider proposition that a State is under a general duty not to refuseadmission to its own nationals.   The proposed legislation would not makespecific provision for the grant of political asylum - there is n: such provision in respect of Commonwealth citizens under the ,:.ct of 1962.But we would by administrative practice grant asylum to individuals ifthey could establish that refusal cf admission would mean their returnto a country in which they would face danger to life or liberty, orpersecution of such a kind as to render life insupportable, for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular group, or political opinion.   These are the criteria, according to which wecurrently grant asylum to aliens from, for example, South ^frics,against this background of practice in granting asylum, the legislation should be defensible as being in conformity with international law.9.     iipart from these difficulties of principle, a decision to extendcontrol to certain holders of United kingdom passports is likely to raisepractical problems at our ports of entry.    It may to some extent disrupttraffic, and it will give rise to individual cases that may be difficultto decide.   Further, if the East African Governments were to refuse toaccept people whom we had refused to admit, this would give rise to a difficult situation which could be overcome only by our telling theairline companies that anyone allowed to embark from East ^frica for thiscoun^-y without an entry certificate would be carried at the companies&apos;risK.   Even this would not solve the problems of tae person who set out from gast ..frica ostensibly for a country on the Continent of Europe, andthen made his way to the United kingdom, since Continental countries might not be prepared to re-admit holders of United Kingdom passports towhom we had refused entry.    It is not possible to say in advance howintractable these difficulties might be.    &quot;.&quot;e should have to reply largely on the announcement of the control, and of our intention resolutely toenforce it, to deter would-be immigrants from setting out.-10,   There is also the question of the Commonwealth reaction to theextension of the control, and of reaction in this country.    Some will saythat the extension of control is based on colour prejudice, and some commonwealth Governments may retaliate by imposing restrictions on the entry of British travellers.   &apos; ro would defend extension of the control byexplaining that this course is the one most likely, in the long term, tobe conducive to good race relations in this country since it Is only ifimmigration is seen by the British public to be effectively controlled thatwe create the conditions to foster good race relaticns.    .&quot;e would alsopoint to the equity of the extension, in that all Commonwealth citizens(including citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies) who did not belong to the United kingdom would bo treated in the same way.   And we would makethe point that relations with the independent Commonwealth countries are unlikely to be as good as we would like to see them if relations betweenthe races in this country are not good.- V -confidential
Manpower11,   The extension of control to citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies not belonging to the United Kingdom, and the curtailment of theright of dependent children to enter to join a single parent, will giverise to increased work, and will call for some addition to the strengthof the Immigration Service, and perhaps also at headquarterso    Inaddition, it will be desirable to station one or two experienced officersin East Africa, at least temporarily, to ait as entry certificateofficerso    Further, an extension of the voucher scheme to cover theexempt citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies will require some additional staff for the Ministry of Labour.     It is not possible to make an exact calculation of the additional   manpower required, but it shouldnot exceed 200- 5 -C O NFID E N TIA L
Appendix ITILJ CITIZENSHIP position.     The existence in East Africa of large numbers of United kingdom citizens who have no connection with the United Kingdom is due to aconcurrence of two causess    (a)   the fact that the United Kingdom and colonies form a single unit for citizenship purposes^, and (b)   the refusal of the emergent countries of East Africa to agree to theircitizenship being conferred automatically at Independence on all personsborn, registered, or naturalized in those territories as citizens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies,2,     when successively Tanganyika, Uganda and Kenya approached Independencetheir governments wanted to exclude as many Asians as possible fromautomatic acquisition of the new citizenship and accordingly in each casethe constitution gave citizenship (i)   to persons born in the territory,only if one parent also had been born there, and (ii)   to persons bornoutside the territory of fathers born there, only if also one grandparenthad been born there.     This excluded from citizenship many people of Asianrace whose parents had been born in India, Pakistan or Ceylon;   and mostof these will have been citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies atIndependence, either by reason of birth in a colony (Kenya Colony) or bybirth in a protectorate of a father who was British at the time of the birth by reason of his own birth in British India or Ceylon.3.     In addition there were in all three territories before Independencea large number of citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies byregistration (Asians who had not been born in the territories but, beingcitizens of India or Pakistan, or British subjects without Citizenship**,were entitled to acquire our citizenship by registration after a period of residence in a colony or protectorate)j    and a smaller number of citizensby naturalisation (mostly aliens from Europe).4,     It is usual, when Independence is granted to a colony orprotectorate, for Parliament to take away citizenship of the United Kingdomand Colonie^ from all who automatically become citizens of the new country at Independence unless the person, or his father or father&apos;s father, wasborn, naturalised or registered in the United Kingdom or a remaining colony.In no case has citizenship been taken away from anyone not acquiring the newcitizenship, for that would have made the person stateless.*The Colonies could not be given a separate citizenship, because they donot constitute an entity for international purposes and the United kingdom is responsible for their external relations.**Persons born in India or Pakistan but who, not being domiciled there atthe appropriate dates in 1950 or 1951? did not become citizens of thosecountries.- i -
5.     The remaining Asians who were not citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies at Independence will have been either British protected persons(if born in a protectorate of a father born in an Indian Native state orcitizens of India or Pakistan (if domiciled there at the appropriate date),or British subjects without citizenship (if they left India or Pakistan too soon to qualify for citizenship of those countries).     All these are alreadysubject to the Commonwealth Immigrants Act and are not the concern of this paper, but are mentioned for the sake of completeness,6.     All those citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies referred to inparagraphs 2 and 3 above were given the right to be registered as citizens of Tanganyika, Uganda and Kenya respectively within two years of independence, on condition of renunciation of their citizenship of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies.     Upwards of 10,000 Asians took advantage ofthis facility;   no doubt the others were either unaware of it or preferred to retain their connection with the United Kingdom in case life should bemade difficult for them in an African country.*    These people may stillapply for registration as citizens of Tanzania,, Uganda or Kenya, but in theformer two countries registration is at the discretion of the authorities,and in Kenya it is subject to a residence qualification.7.     The dual citizens who exist in large numbers in Malaysia and theWesc Indies have acquired this status in quite different circumstances.8,     When in 1957 the Federation of Malaya became an independent republic the usual provisions withdrawing United Kingdom citizenship (seeparagraph 4 above) were not included in the Irdependence Act because animplicit undertaking had been given to the &quot;queen s Chinese&quot; (inhabitants of the Colonies of Penang and Malacca) that their connection with the queen and the United Kingdom iftould remain unaffected.9.     When Independence was granted to Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago,British Guiana and Barbados, the usual withdrawal provisions were included in the Independence Acts, but because our citizenship iscitizenship of the United Kingdom &quot;and Colonies&quot; the usual exemption from loss of citizenship (see paragraph 4 above) extended to (a)   thosenumerous people whose fathers or grandfathers had been born in some otherWest Indian territory which vra,s still a colony when the country of theirbirth became independent;   and (b)   others who acquired the new citizenshipby virtue only of their father&apos;s birth in the country acquiring Independence,having been themselves born in what was still a colony.     It would have been impossible to deprive all these people of their United Kingdom citizenshipwithout doing injustice to some people who would have felt that theyproperly belonged to the United Kingdom and remaining Colonies rather than to the newly independent territory.In Zanzibar a number of Asians who automatically acquired localcitizenship and lost United Kingdom citizenship were later deprived of their local citizenship and were left stateless.     This may well have discouraged other Asians in East Africa from taking steps whichwould have led to their giving up United Kingdom citizenship.- ii -

appendix iii the FORM OF LEG-ISLATION1.     Section 1 of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 19^2 exempts fromimmigration control(a) a person born in the United Kingdom;(b) a person who holds a United Kingdom passport andis a citizen of the United Kingdom and C&amp;lonios,or who holds such a passport issued in theUnited Kingdom or the Republic of Ireland;   and(o)    a person included in the passport of another person who is excepted under (a) or (b).For the purpose of (b) and (c), &quot;passport&quot; means a current passport, and&quot;United Kingdom passport&quot; means a passport issued to the holder by theGovernment of the United Kingdom, not being a passport go issued on behalfof the Government of any part of the Commonwealth outside the UnitedKingdom.2,     The effect of section 1 is to apply immigration control to citizens of the United Kingdam and Colonies only if they were born outside theUnited Kingdom and their passport were issued by or on behalf of thegovernment ef some other part of the Commonwealth.     After a territory hasbecome an independent member of the Commonwealth, ics government issuespassports only to those of its inhabitants who have become citizen;&apos;: of thenew state.     The others, who remain citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies, must then obtain their passports from the United KingdomGovernment through the British High Commission;   passports so obtained,being United Kingdom passports within the meaning of section 1, exempt the holders from control.3-.     To bring these &quot;non-belongers&quot; within the scope of the control, itwill be necessary to amend section 1 so as to provide that a citizen of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies who holds a United Kingdom passport shall be exempt from the control only if he &quot;belongs&quot; to the United Kingdom in asei.se to be specified in the amended provision.     The qualifying connectionthought appropriate for this purpose Is that the person concerned or hisfather or his father&apos;s father(a) was born in the United Kingdom, or(b) was naturalized in the United Kingdom, or(c) was registered as a citizen of the United Kingdom and colonies in the United Kingdom or in a country whichat the date of registration was mentioned in section 1(3)of the British Nationality ,-i.ct 1948*, or(d) was adopted in the United Kingdom.*that is, a country which was an independent Commonwealth country at thedate of the registration.
This is similar to the formula adopted in Independence Acts to definethose citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who, although acquiringthe citizenship of the newly independent country, are not to lose theircitizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies.- 2 -
APPENDIX IVRELEVANT INTERNATIONAL AGREBj-ENTS(a) Universal Declaration      Humm RightsArticle 13(2) states:   &quot;Everyone has the right to leave anycoantry, including his own, and to return to his country&quot;.The Declaration does not impose legal obligations but, asthe Prime Minister said in Parliament on .4th February 1 965&quot;it does ef course have great moral authority which her majesty&apos;s Government, for their part, will do all in their power to support&quot;.     Further, 1968 is International human rights Year.(b) United Nations Convention on Racial DiscriminationArticle 5(b)(ii) states:   &quot;States who are parties undertake to prohibit and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee the right of every&amp;ne,without distinction as to race, colour, or national orethnic origin, to equalitjr before the law, notably in the enjoyment of the following rights 0........... The rightto leave any country, including one&apos;s own, and to returnto one&apos;s country&quot;.The United Kingdom has signed the Convention and is considering ratification.     Assuming that we ratify, theproposed extension of immigration control might be challenged,and might have to be justified before the United Nations as not discriminating on grounds of race, colour or nationaler ethnic origin.(c) International Covenant on Civil and Political RightsArticle 12(4) states:   &quot;No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country&quot;.Similar considerations apply as at (b) above and theextension of control might have to be justified on the groundthat it was not &quot;arbitrary&quot;.(d) European Convention of Human Rights/article 3(2) of tho Fourth Protocol states:    &quot;lie ono-shall be deprived of the right to enter the territory of the state ofwhich he is a national&quot;.The United Kingdom has ratified   the Convention and hassigned but not yet ratified the Fourth Protocol.     In the caseof (a), (b) and (c) above we could, in addition to the specific points noted under (b) and (0) argue generally that we were notin breach of the instruments because the persons to whomimmigration control is to be extended, although technicallyour nationals, are not so olosely connected with the UnitedKingdom as to belong to it.     But it would be more difficultto mount and sustain this kind of argument in relation to theEuropean Convention since it is in such specific terms.We should be forced to rely on arguments drawn from the anomalousnature of citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies.
