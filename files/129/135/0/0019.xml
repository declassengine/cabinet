IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)65C(68) 19 COPY NO.__^11th January, 196QCABINETPUB LIC EXPENDITURE:  POST -DEVALUATION MEASURESDEFENCE CUTS; THE F. IllMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Defence&quot;When we discussed the F, 111 last week, the Cabinet(CC(68) 1st Conclusions, Minute 3) invited me to propose alternativeeconomies with a view to securing defence savings comparable withthose which I could make if the whole F. II 1 order were cancelled.The Gross Saving from Cancellation2.      On the assumption that our withdrawal from East of Suezis completed by April, 1971 I can reduce the defence budget from 1, 890 million in 1968-69 to  1, 650 million in 1972-73 (at 1964 prices)while keeping the 5 0 F. Ills and 170 Phantoms now on order.     Thissaving v/ould be reduced by  10 million if withdrawal is not completeduntil April, 1972.    The impact on all three Ser\ices will be severeand rapid, though it will take some time to work out the consequencesin detail.    By the early 1970s there will be massive cuts in thenumbers of fighting units.     The size of the forces will be cut by80,000 - representing an immense transfer of manpower to the civilsector - equivalent, with their families, to a town the size ofNewcastle or Leicester.    Apart from a radical reduction in thewhole support organisation we shall have cuts in many &quot;teeth&quot; areas,including the aircraft carriers and the rate of new naval building;cuts in the number and organisation of regiments and battalions;cuts in the transport and maritime forces of the RAF and the elimination of the proposed VG combat aircraft.    Against this background, if we are to maintain effective volunteer forces at all,the remainder must know they will have good conditions of serviceand such new equipment as is essential for their tasks,3.      If our reduced forces are to be given no protection whateveragainst the consequences of losing a strike/reconnaissaaes eapabildtyon which they have depended since the invention of the flying machine,and our NATO allies are prepared to see us remove all their bestreconnaissance aircraft and an essential part of their longer-rangestrike force without making any compensatory increase in our contribution in other ffolds, cancellation of the F, 111 order would save an average of  39 million a year or  390 million in all up till1977-78, though owing to the incidence of credit repayments the saving in 1972-73 would be  57 million.
4.      On the other hand, owing to cancellation charges our expenditure next year on the F, 1.11 would increase from 16 million to  38 million,  33 million of which would be in dollars.We would also lose the substantial benefits under the offset agreement which I described in C(68) 10, and which ensure that if wo keep the50 F. Ills, we shall earn at least $5 0 million more than we pay overthe next three years.    Annex A to this paper deals more fully witharguments against the offset agreement which were used by some ofmy colleagues at our meeting of 4th January.The Military capability lost by Cancellation5.      The unanimous view of all four Chiefs of Staff on theimportance of the F. Ill to all three Services is summarised in thefollowing statement:   &quot;&quot;The heart of the case for the quality of long-range strike and reconnaissance capability represented by the F. Illis that, broadly speaking, all other operations of war short of ultimatestrategic, nuclear attack take place either under cover of this capabilityor with the knowledge that we have it at our disposal if necessary.If this capability is abandoned then our sea, land and air forces arenot only deprived of the ability to find out by reconnaissance whatan enemy or potential enemy is doing, or is planning to do, but arealso thrown back on an essentially defensive strategy with all thatthis means in surrender of the initiative.    The loss of the F. Illwould, therefore, carry the gravest military implications for theUnited Kingdomss ability to participate in military operations inEurope and overseas and remove an element of real sig&amp;if icance inthe process of control of escalation&quot;.6.      I described in C(6&amp;) 10 the critical importance of the F. 111&apos;strike capability in reducing NATO&apos;s reliance on nuclear weapons.I would like here to re-emphasise the importance of reconnaissance,not only in saving the lives of our fighting men, but also in checkingthe escalation of a crisis.    Once we received intelligence that something was afoot we should want to have the most accurate information possible before deciding how to react.    Aerialreconnaissance is the prime source of such inf information-tion.    The F, lilhas two special attributes as a reconnaissance aircraft, one of whichis possessed by no other aircraft pianned for service in Europe;without crossing national boundaries it will be able to look &quot;sideways&quot;with camera and radar fro about 100 miles from within friendly airspace or from international waters.    If, however, at a later stage in the crisis fighting has started, the F. Hi can pass over nationalboundaries, and its chances of being able to do so and return, whatever the weather conditions, are much greater than that of any other aircraft because of its supersonic speed, range and sophisticatedelectronic fit.7.      The Phantom offers no alternative.    It is essentially an aircraft for operating in the battlefield area.    It lacks the uniqueand valuable &quot;sideways&quot;-looking photographic facility.     In there connaissance role it has not the performance at the relevantheights, it is limited in bad weather and its   range is only a qt&amp;axterthat of the F, 111.    To give the Buccaneer an analagous but muchinferior reconnaissance capability would take some seven years ata programme cost no less than that of the F. 111A which would otherwise have replaced the Canberra some five years earlier.
When we originally reduced our F. Ill order from 110 to 50, weassumed that they would supplement some 15 0 AFVG, coming into service primarily in Europe from 1975 onwards.     The AFVG projectcollapsed last year, and it is now clear that there is no chance ofcollaborating in a UKVG aircraft in the same time scale.    This has given a new importance to the 5 0 F. 111, particularly in Europe.8.     For Britain to depend wholly on the United States and Franceproviding aircraft for vital information in a crisis would gravelydamage our political influence on events, quite apart from its military consequences.9.      The reconnaissance and strike capability could be eqqallyimportant outside Europe both in the final stages of our withdrawal and in any operations we might undertake thereafter.    Indeed it isclear that if our general capability in Europe does not include the.F. Ill, our declared readiness to help outside Europe if we believe it our duty or interest to do so will be worth very little to those whose acquiescence in our withdrawal we are now seeking.Our copt ribution to NATO10.     A.s I understand it, one purpose of our withdrawal into europe is to maximise our influence with our continental neighbours, anob jective of paramount importance whatever our relationship withthe Common Market.   I do not believe it would be politically possibleor desirable to rob NATO of the 36 front-line F. Ill (which is what abuy of 50 will permit) we have already promised,, in replacement forthe 100 Canberras assigned to NATO and the further 50 Canberrasavailable to NATO in a crisis, without maiding some increase in our air contribution to compensate for their loss.11.     The tables at Annex B show how our own projected defence programme in 1972-73 will compare with that of France and Germanyboth in terms of money and of forces provided for West european defence.12.     The force figures show that without the F. Ill contribution our effort in the common deferce would compare more closely with that of holland than with France or Germany.    The expenditure figures(which are on the NATO definition for purposes of comparability and include, e. g. military aid) show that on the basis of present plansour total expenditure in 1972-73 would be some  4-500 million lower than that of France or Germany (even before taking account of thelatter rs heavy -expenditure - seme  275 million - on the support of berlin).    On the basis of expenditure per head of population, thefigures would bejUnited Kingdom  36France  50Germany   40The disparity would still be significant if the F. Ill uere included inour programme.-3-
13.     A big increase in our land contribution is undesirable on many-grounds - including the additonal foreign exchange expenditure and thedoubt whether we could achieve it without conscription.     There is no case for increasing our naval contribution.    Any increase to compensate for loss of the f, 111 would have to be made in aircraft,14.     At psoo&amp;Sit the total number of combat aircraft we declare to NATO is 223.    In 1972 without the 36 F. Ills it would amount to only100 aircraft (including 32 rV bombers whose operational value is steadily waning).     In my view, there is no possibility of persuadingour allies that a reduction on this scale, when we have disengaged from east of Suez and at a time when NATO strategy is being revised - a tour urging - to lay greater stress on the flexibility of conventionalair power, justifies the claim that we are bearing anything like ourfair share of the defence burden.     The German aircraft contribution would be several times larger than ours, while their Army contributionwas five times greater.    We should be offering fewer aircraft than.Italy and at the best the same numerical order as the Dutch and the belgians.    Above all, the argument that we were making up in quality for a  reduction in quantity would have been removed.15.     Both from the point of view of general capability and ourrelations with NATO, the work I have done suggests that if we have noF. 111 xs the least unsatisfactory course would be to buy at least afurther 75 Phantoms.     These 75 Phantoms would produce a frontline of some 50 to supplement the 20 already assigned to NATO andthe 20 which would later become available to NATO from the Gulfand Far East.    Besides being the only aircraft availaole when theCanberras are withdrawn next year, the Phantom!s ability to shootdown enemy aircraft in the air would do something to compensate forending our ability to destroy enemy aircraft mere cheaply and effectively on the ground.    Although in general it could be said that5 0 Phantoms can carry about the same weight of weapons as36 F. Ills, this is not a meaningful comparison-    Because of thequite different performance characteristics of the Phantom, inparticular its inferior reconnaissance capability, its inability to strike in all weathers, and its shorter range, the overalloperational effectiveness of our contribution would be greatly reduced,even if we substituted this larger number of aircraft.16.     The 10-year cost of 75 Phantoms required would be 275 million of which the dollar content would be   118 million andthe additional DM stationing costs  12 million.    The budgetary costin 1972-73 would be  34 million.    Apart from these financial implications, there would be ether seriotxs implications not least for thefuture of our aircraft industry.The net savings from cancellation of the F. 11117.     I therefore assume that we should have to add back some 275 million over the 10-year period to pay for an additional75 Phantoms.     The net saving we should secure by cancelling theF. Ill would therefore be  115 million over the 10-year period and  23 million in 1972-73.-4-
How to find a comparable saving18.     (a) Forces in GermanyAn unknown factor in the equation is the extent to which wemay reduce our forces in Germany before 1972 either because weare unable to make a satisfactory offset arrangement or becauseour allies cut their forces or because there are reciprocal reductions on both sides of the iron Curtain.    However, we cannot quantify suchsavings,, still less announce them now -- a problem which arisessimilarly  from our general intention to introduce selectivity intofamily allowances.(b) Restructuring of the ServicesIf concrete savings must be identified, the right way to do it,as I argued in C(68) 11, is to re-examine the whole of our forcestructure, and support organisation in the light of our more rapidwithdrawal into Europe, but it will take several months to do so.I can certainly undertaKe to find savings in 1972-73 to fill the gap -as I have found all the savings required of me on four previous occasions.(c) Immediate possibilitiesIf however, my colleagues decide that for presentationalreasons the Government must be able to announce specific furthercuts in dev. ence next week even though this might turn out to produceless desirable savings than a thorough study would allow, my viewswould be as follows -(i)   I would not propose cutting or cancelling the Harrierorder, because though it has a low militarypriority I believe the general advantages of continuing the only British advanced co*nbat aircraft now take precedence.(ii)   I would propose to cancel the order for the Anglo-FrenchMartel missile, thus saving  79 million in 10 yearsand  17 million in 1972-73.    The implications of thiscut are explained in Annex C.(iii)    To find the balance of the comparable saving of 23 million in 1972-73 I would choose between theabandonment of the Bloodhound system ( 2 million),phasing out some of the V-bombers more quickly (upto  10 million) and stopping research and development on an Airborne Early Warning (AEW) aircraft ( 7 million).There are almost certainly other possibilities,    Any ofthese cuts would be painful and unwelcome but they arein my view areas of less critical importance than theF. Ill capability.
19.     It may be suggested that the argument in paragraphs 15-17about the net as opposed to the gross saving is unacceptable.    Istrongly disagree; although I acknowledge that in the short time available the assessment of a compensating capability could only berough and ready.    Some may say it is too big.    Some may argue that it should not be made at all although this can only be tantamount to asking me to find another  390 million off the defence budget overthe next 10 years in addition to the cuts which already reduce theprogramme to  1,650 million in 1972-73.    This would be a stillmore difficult and speculative task and inevitably involves looking forward into the second five years (1973-1978) of the period as thereis such a long lead time in the defence procurement areas,20.     I have been able to examine such a proposition only veiycursorily.    The area I have indicated in paragraph I8(c)(ii) and (iii)would save at least  100 million in the first five years.    their continued effect, together with the elimination of firm assumptionsin our 10-year costings   such as the purchase of United States C5transport aircraft and a United Kingdom built AEW aircraft in thesecond five years, would result in a total saving of some  400 millionequivalent to the gross cost of the F. Ill programme less onlycancellation charges.    I quote these only for illustrative purposes,but here again I can assure my colleagues that I would be preparedto forgo those a? other items as of less importance, both short andleng term, then the F. 111 !s contribution to our military capabilityand credibility.Conclus ions21.     I conclude that:-(a) To eliminate the F.1H from our defence programme withoutreplacement would put our fighting men at risk and seriously damage our political and military influence in NATO.(b) It would also mean spending an additional $60 million in1968-69 and losing the advantages of the $825 million cffset target Ihave just negotiated.(c) There is no aircraft available which could replace theCanberras from 1969 and provide an equivalent military capability.The nearest substitute would be the Phantom.    The programme costs of 75 Phantoms would amount to some  275 million compared with thenext F. Ill saving of  390 million.    The comparable saving v,hat I setmyself to find is therefore  115 million, of which  23 million would fall in 1972-73.(d) I could guarantee to find this comparable saving in the courseof restructuring the forces following upon oui decisions on commit-ments.(e) If there is a desire for presentational reasons that I shouldidentify these savings now, my proposals are set out in paragraph 18 c(ii) and (iii).    These cuts include a complete and publicly knownweapons system, Martel, which we are currently undertaking in collaboration with France.
(f)     If we ignore the costs of any substitution programme and take the ten year gross costs of the F. Ill programme less cancellationcosts -  390 million - I could  guarantee to find savings over the10-year defence budget.    Such savings would include those in (e)above and would go on in the second half of the 10-year period toinclude the elimination of such major new equipment purchases currentlyin the programme as the United States C5 transport aircraft and theconstruction of an AEW aircraft.Rec ommendation22,     I therefore recommend my colleagues to confirm the purchaseof 50 F. Ills.D. W. H.Ministry of Defence S. W, 1.11th January, 1968-7-
CONFIDENTIAL -        20ANNEX AThe Offset Arrangement1.     Some of the arguments used at the last meeting to writedown the value of the offset arrangement seem to me to heunsound and I seek in the following paragraphs to explain theposition as I see it.2.     It was argued that &quot;export earnings under the agreementdid not bring in net benefit to the balance of payments;they simply prevented the deterioration which would otherwiseresult from purchase of the aircraft&quot;.    This argument I donot accept.   We cancelled the TSR 2 partly because it wasnot going to be ready in time, partly because of its very high and rapidly escalating cost and partly to diversifyresources to civil industry, thus benefitting the economy.It was implicit in that decision that a foreign aircraft would have to be bought   in its place, since there was noother British aircraft in prospect that could meet the require-ment.    Indeed the P.Ill was the only aircraft that could doso.    It was because I was conscious that this unavoidablepurchase would involve expenditure in foreign exchange thatI obtained the offset arrangement.    It would have beenunrealistic to expect the Americans to undertake to do morethan offset its cost;    but, as shewn below, there is a good chance that they may in the long run do much more than merely&quot;prevent deterioration&quot;.   Meanwhile, during the immediatefuture,  the receipts from sales to America under the offsetare considerably exceeding the payments to be made for theP.111.3.      It was argued that &quot;there was a good prospect that theindustrial resources now devoted to securing sales under theoffset agreement could be diverted to exports which would bring a positive balance of payments benefit&quot;,    I should liketo see some positive evidence to support this statement.    Thefacts are that during the U or 5 years preceding the signing of the offset arrangement the US defence market had beenvirtually closed to our industries.    Under the Buy AmericanActs, foreign competitors had long suffered a discrimination of6% (or in some cases 12%) as compared with the Americanproducer;    and this applied to all US Government corn-petitions.In i960 the US Department of Defense introduced a price-differential of 50% inclusive of duty which could be applied in the defence field whenever it gave a more penal handicapto the foreign competitor than the 6% or 12% plus duty.These restrictions made it virtually impossible for british firms to obtain defence contracts in the United States unlessthe US has no source of their own or for some special reasonwanted to buy abroad.    What the offset arrangement did was tobreak down these barriers and give British firms once more anopportunity of competing for contracts on equal terms with the americans.   Moreover the American Forces were instructed to search out British equipment which would be suitable for their needs and to provide opportunities for British companies to tender for contracts.    I am sure my colleagues will agree with me in attaching importance to maintaining access for as manyBritish industries as possible to the enormous US market.Over lk% of our exports go to the United States, which is nearly three times as much as we export to any other country.This seems to indicate that maintaining access to the USdefence market for as long as possible must be in itselfbeneficial and more worthwhile than seeking to transfer the effort to other exports which in may event we are doing all/we .....
we can to obtain.   Firms such as Elliott Automation who get their foot in the American door have a chance of establishingproduction lines out of all proportion to those appropriate for other markets.   The competition is healthy for both countries:    the Americans benefit from reduced prices even when the British firm does not win and the British firms have valuable lessons to learn from the high standards of american competition.k.     It was argued that gaining a foothold in the US market was &quot;of limited advantage, since it was certain that, once the target for offset sales had been reached, the barriersto sales in tho United States would immediately re-appear&quot;.I do not know on what evidence this statement is based.   the americans obviously could not make the offset arrangementopen-ended;    and they have naturally been cautious aboutpublic statements.   There is, however, good reason to suppose that the target figure will be exceeded.    Moreover, beforethe target (including the extra $100 million) is reached, theUS balance of payments may improve,  in which case the 50%price-differential would be removed since the American forces would be glad to make the budgetary savings which access toour highly competitive products would afford.    In any event the arrangement is due to run for nearly 10 more years.5.     Finally, the provisions of the offset arrangement dealingwith collaborative sales have already given us access to a market hitherto regarded as a US preserve;    this would alsobe true of any further collaborative sales, for otherwise weshould not accept them as truly collaborative.

ANNEX CImplications of Reducing or Abandoning the&quot; Martel programme the development of the Anglo/French Martel air-to-air gu.ided missile,  in both its anti-radar (AR) and tele-vision-guided (TV) versions, is nearing completion but wehave not yet placed any production orders.2.      If we abandon Martel our strike aircraft will be without any stand-off capability for attacking defendedtargets both on land, and at sea.     They will be forced touse less accurate weapons and to approach the target more closely,  thus increasing their vulnerability.     Retentionof the AR missile v/ould allow radar targets to be attacked,which would be particularly useful at sea, but there v/ouldstill be no stand-off capability against visual targets.3*     Abandonment of Martel might cause difficulties withthe French who might find unwelcome the extra cost of developing and producing their own small requirementsunilaterally and might be less willing to collaborate with us on other projects,,     They would be more likely toconsider withdrawing from the helicopter programme than from Jaguar,     Their withdrawal from the helicopterswould be serious though not catastrophic.k.      On the other hand our judgment is that the french have strong motives of self interest (as we have) in continuing with both the Jaguar and helicopter programmes,,On balance therefore,  although the French might complainat being let down on Martel, particularly so soon afterthe signing of the Jaguar production agreement, there arereasonable chances that ?/e might avoid any serious repercussions.     The chances would be considerably increased if v/e could complete development of the weaponand continue with the AR programme.5.      Abandoning production of Martel completely would saveabout  75M in the ten-year period ( 17M in 1972/73)0Confining production to the AR requirement as currentlystated would save about  50M ( 13M In 1972/73).6.     Cancelling the development of Martel at this latestage would save only  kM out of the  25M which is the UKhalf share of the cost of the joint development programme,,We could therefore complete development for a relatively small extra cost.     This would:ae     help considerably to avoid difficulties withthe French which might affect other collabora-tive programmes;b.     establish a stronger claim to a share ofproduction to meet French requirements,although the share may not be large.The savings quoted in the main paper assume that develop-ment is not completed.
