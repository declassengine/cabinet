pIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP&apos; HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (1+9) 163 COPY NO..21ST JULY. 191+9CABINETTHE LONDON DOCK STRIKE;    EMERGENCY POvVERSMemorandum by the Attorney-general  have been asked to state (or. testate) the positionof the National Dock Labour Board in relation to the Emergency Committee established under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920,I referred to the matter in C. P. (1+9) 11+8.(1)   Under Regulation 1 of the Emergencs^ Regulations theEmergency Committee is empowered to give such directions to thePort Authority &quot;or other persons&quot; for regulating, facilitatingand expediting the traffic at the Port &quot;as appear to theCommittee to be necessary ftp expedient&quot;.     These words are inmy view v/ide enough to justify the Committee in giving theNational Dock Labour Board either a general direction that,e. g, in the administration of the Dock Labour Scheme theyshould act only in consultation and with the consent of theEmergency Committee or an ad hoc direction in regard to some particular matter.     They might, for instance, if they con-sidered it expedient (which I imagine they would hardly to), .direct the National Dock Labour Board that it was to if,\v&apos;e no public statement without the prior approval of the Comm. &apos; ee.(2)    I pointed out in CP, (1+9) 11+8 that the legality of directions to the National Dock Labour Board, which is, investedwith statutory responsibilities, was possibly in some doubt,since the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, does not in termsprovide that subsequent statutory enactments can be over-,ridden, but I indicated that in my view the Emergency Corunittee /should disregard this doubt and should take such action as ^appeared necessary without too much regard for the niceties ofthe law, and if the Committee consider it expedient to issuedirections to the Board I think myself that they are entitledto do so and should do so.(3)   But no such directions have, as I understand, in fact been issued and that being so the National Dock Labour Board isa completely independent statutory authority, the employer ofall registered dock workers not allocated  to particularemployers, and under a statutory responsibility for the admini-stration of the Dock Labour Scheme.      It is, inter alia, theresponsibility of the Board &quot;to ensure the full and properutilisation of dock labour for the purpose of facilitating the rapid and economic turn round of vessels and the speedy transitof goods through the Port&quot;.      It is also the responsibility ofthe Board to operate the disciplinary code contained in theScheme, which entitles the Board to dismiss dock workers whoare guilty of serious misconduct (e,g, in refusing to obey law-ful orders) or who fail to comply with the provisions of theScheme,(1+)    In the discharge of these functions the Board is (inthe absence of any direction under the Emergency Regulations)quite independent of the Government,     The fact that the Chairmanis a member of the Government is fortuitous.      I commented on

the constitutional implications arising from Lord /jnmon/appointment while a member of the Government as Chairman ofthe national Dock Labour Corporation on 30th August, 19^+5, and similar comments may apply to his present position.      however that may be, it is clear that he is neither subject to theorders of the Government in his capacity as Chairman of theBoard nor to dismissal, since members of the Board are appointed for a fixed term.      That the Board should in circum-stances such as those now existing act in close consultationwith the Minister of Labour and the Emergency Committee ismanifest, as is the fact that, although by wholesale dismissalsits continuance could no doubt be placed in jeopardy, the dock labour Scheme cannot be revoked or amended by the Board.     Norindeed can such action be takon by the Government save afterpublic enquiry and the lapse of time.      On the other hand, theultimate responsibility for the administration of the Schemedoes rest upon the Board and not the Government, and it is theBoard which (in the absence of direction) would have to decidev/hether to operate the disciplinary code.      I mention this because the Board, and the Government, may be open to some criticism for the fact that, as I understand on Governmentadvice, the Board has refrained from operating the Scheme, andin particular the disciplinary code, since the trouble firstarose on the &quot;Beaverbrae&apos; in ^pril, and the Board may seek tosay that in the absence of a direction from the Emergency Committee whereby the Government accepted the responsibilityit was for them to decide how to discharge their primaryresponsibilities and how long to regard the disciplinary codeas a dead letter.(5)    I do not know whether the Emergency Committee has sofar issued any directions.      I suggested at Cabinet meetings on 7th and 11th July that it might be inexpedient to proclaiman Emergency unless and until a definite course of actionrequiring the use of Emergency Powers had been decided upon.The Emergency Committee is, of course, the instrument of theGovernment and under the control of the Minister of transport and if in fact it has issued any directions in regard to matters which could not have been dealt with in the absenceof Emergency Powers it might be useful to make the fact public.H. vi. S.w Courts, W, C. 2.21 ST JULY, 1949
