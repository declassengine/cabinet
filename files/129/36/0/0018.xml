lieCS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET.P. (49) 168 COPY NO.   3 Ip6TH JULY. 1949CABINETIRON AND STEEL BILL:    PARLIAMENTARY TIMETABLEMemorandum by the Minister of Sup-plyThe Cabinet- on 20th June. (C. M. (49) 41st Conclusions,Minute 2) &quot;agreed that the Government should decline to accept any amendment moved in the House of Lords with the object ofproviding that the Iron and Steel Bill could not be broughtinto effective operation until after the general election&quot;.. On 30th June (C. M. (49) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 1)the Cabinet agreed that if there were exchanges between thetwo Houses on the Lords&apos; amendments, it would be desirableto defer until the autumn the completion of the discussions between the two Houses on the Lords&apos; amendments.2. - The present situation is that the Lords have proposed some .30 amendments with which the Commons havedisagreed.     The Commons&apos; disagreement will go to the lords on Thursday, 28th July, and it may be assumed that the Lordswill insist on at least one group of amendments.      If they doinsist, that insistence will be reported back to the House ofCommons and the final deadlock will not be reached until the commons insist on their disagreement.3* I understand it has been proposed that the commons should insist on their disagreements before the Recess;   butfor reasons which I outline in the following paragraphs mycolleagues may wish to consider whether the wiser course maynot be to leave further consideration of the Lords&apos; amendmentsuntil after the Recess.4. The difficulty is that, if the 1st May, 1950, if   v&apos;kept in the Bill, it will be necessary for the Bill to be   welaw before that date even if it were intended to exercise   -hepower of postponement.     This cannot be guaranteed under taeParliament Act procedure unless the next Session is brought toan end before that date.      This involves either a special shortsession of some six weeks for the sole purpose of passing theIron and Steel Bill;    or bringing to an end. the ordinary 1950Session before the 1st May.      The latter course may bedifficult by reason of the demands of financial and other business.5. There remain the alternatives of altering the reference in the Bill to the 1st May, 1950, to a later date;or of persuading the House of Lords to pass the Bill in itspresent form this Session on an assurance by the Governmentthat the date of transfer will be postponed by order until after the General Election.

6, As regards alteration of the date, it is a littledangerous to assume that this can be done in the Bill intro-duced next Session.      If the Opposition in the Lordsrealised that the Government were in a difficulty under the parliament Act procedure, they might leave the 1st May,1950, in the Bill and hold up the Bill until after that date.7* In order to allow these rather complicated alterna-tives to be considered by the Government, I suggest thatfinal disagreement with the Lords before the Summer Recessshould be avoided.G. R* S.Ministry of Supply, W. C. 2.26TH JULY, 19*4-9*
