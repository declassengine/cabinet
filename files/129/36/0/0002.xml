Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1949Copy No.  31CABINETMINERAL development memorandum by the Chancellor of the Dxjchy of lancaster. By a minute of the Prime Minister dated 10th May, 1949, a mineral development (Policy) Committee was appointed,, under my chairmanship, &quot;toexamine the report of the Mineral Development Committee and to formulatepolicy proposals for consideration by the Cabinet.&quot; The composition of theCommittee;is^set out in M.D. (49) 1, a copy of which is annexed. The following is our report.2. The Mineral Development Committee, whose report is attached, waspresided&quot; over by Lord Westwood. Its members included six scientific and engineering experts, one accountant and one economist, in addition to the Chair-man himself and two M.P.s, one Labour and one Tory. It was, therefore, highlyexpert within its field and only very slightly political. With the exception of theTory politician, all the members united in recommending the nationalisation ofa wide range of minerals found in the United Kingdom. It is an interestingcoincidence that the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, withoutknowledge of the Westwood Report, in the statement &quot; Labour Believes in britain &quot; submitted to the last Annual Conference, declared that &quot; we shall takea further step forward by placing all suitable minerals in public ownership.&quot;3. We have held three meetings and, having heard Departmental views, werecommend that the main proposal of the Westwood Committee should be accepted.Legislation should be passed in the next Parliament to vest in the State the ownership of certain minerals, which might conveniently be named in a Scheduleto the Bill, and this Schedule should be capable of being amended from time totime by Ministerial Order.Nationalisation of Mineral Rights4. The State should not take over the ownership of minerals of such commonoccurrence as chalk, clay and gravel, but the following, all of which were consideredby the Westwood Committee, should be acquired.(a) Metalliferous Ores of Tin, Tungsten, Lead, Haematite iron ore,* Zinc,(b) Non-Metalliferous Barytes, Barium Brines, Witherite,&apos; Fluorspar, ChinaClay, Ball Clay, Gypsum, Anhydrite, Salt, Fuller&apos;s Earth, Talc,Serpentine, G-lass Sand, Potash.Ministerial Responsibility5. The Ministry of Fuel and Power Act, 1945, gives to the Minister of fuel and Power &quot; the general duty of securing the effective and co-ordinated develop-ment of coal, petroleum and other minerals.&quot; It would be natural, therefore, tomake the Minister of Fuel and Power responsible for all nationalised minerals.Nor would such an arrangement necessarily affect the present production respon-sibilities Of other Ministers, We have, however, invited the Government Organ-isation Committee to make an early report on this particular problem of ministerial responsibility.&quot; * Under the Iron and Steel Bill, all the companies at present working haematite iron orewill come under public ownership.37278SECRETCP. (49) 15216th July, 1949
Establishment of a Mineral Development Commission6. As the Westwood Committee points out-and, in view of its scientific and other knowledge, its opinion on this matter must carry great weight-therehas been grave neglect by past Governments and by, private enterprise in thesurveying, exploitation and economic working of our,minerals. In order to securethe necessary drive and energetic action the Committee recommend that responsibility for development should be concentrated in a body specially created for this purpose. They recommend, and we support their recommendation, thata Mineral Development Commission should be established.Powers of the Mineral Development Commission7. The Commission should, in the words of the Westwood Committee, havegeneral responsibility for the management on behalf of the nation of the propertyrights in minerals (other than coal and oil, which are already nationalised underthe Ministry of Fuel and Power), and for fostering mineral discovery, develop-ment, efficient working and research. It would work in close association withthe Department of Scientific and Industrial Eesearch and the Geological Survey.We also recommend that, although as a general rule the Commission would not itself carry out the actual exploitation of minerals, it should have power to doso in special cases, subject to the approval of the Minister of Fuel and Power.We also recommend that the Commission should be empowered, in suitable cases,to own surface land above mineral deposits.Compensation and. Development Charges8. All payments to private owners of minerals or mineral rights whichmay fall due to be made have already been provided for by the Town and country planning Act, 1947, and no further payments to these owners will be necessary as a consequence of the adoption of the Westwood Committee&apos;s proposals. -We have considered the question of the method by which development charges should be assessed and paid in respect of minerals worked under the authorityof the Mineral Development Commission. Since this question is very technical,we have asked the Minister of Town and Country Planning to arrange for anofficial Committee to make recommendations.Mining Taxation ,9.   The Westwood Committee recommend (1) that certain expenditure not now allowed as a charge against profitsshould be so allowed;(2) that losses incurred in the early years of operation of a mining concernshould be charged against the first profits available, with no limit on the period during which they can be carried forward.We think that these are matters which should be considered by the TuckerCommittee on the Taxation of Trading Profits.10. The Westwood Committee made three special recommendationsrequiring early decisions : (a) North Yorkshire Potash DepositsIt clearly illustrates our ignorance of our own mineral wealth thatit was not until 1944 that these apparently very rich deposits were discovered.Hitherto we have had to import all our potash, but there is now a prospect that, given the necessary action, we could meet nearly all our needs from ourown resources. Two private firms, LCI. and Fisons, are now exploringthese deposits with the encouragement of the Board of Trade. I.C.I. hopethat after a further 1^ to 2 years they will be able to put forward a&quot;comprehensive plan of development.&quot; This appears to us to be veryslow progress, since substantial production would not begin until after sucha plan had been prepared and initiated. The President of the Board ofTrade, in consultation with the Ministry of Fuel and Power, is considering whether this work, so essential to the national interest, could not bespeeded up.We do not, however, recommend that these potash deposits should be separately nationalised, as the Westwood Committee thought might be neces-sary, in advance of general legislation.
V -     10(6) Production of Tin in the Cam Brea Area in CornwallThe Westwood Committee recommend that such production should becontinued and that, for this purpose, the Minister of Supply should nego-tiate a new contract with the South Crofty Company: The Minister is nownegotiating with the company on the lines recommended by the Committee.(c) Wolfram-tin Deposits at Hemerdon, near PlymouthThe Weetwood Committee recommend that further exploration shouldtake place before the plant which was erected in 1942-43 to work the low-grade wolfram-tin deposits at Hemerdpn, near Plymouth, is broken up ordisposed of. The Minister of Supply agrees that the plant should be kept in working order, but there appears to be no case for further explorationat present. Supplies are sufficient for the next five years and tungstencan be bought without difficulty from abroad. Arrangements have, there-,fore, been made for the plan to be kept on a care and maintenance basis.Production could, if necessary, be started at about two months&apos; notice.Summary of Recommendations11.   We, therefore, -recommend that: (1) Legislation should be introduced in the next Parliament to vest in theState the ownership of all minerals specified in a Schedule to theBill, this Schedule to be capable of amendment from time to time byMinisterial Order.(2) A Mineral Development Commission should be established and shouldhave, in addition to the powers recommended in the WestwoodReport, power to exploit minerals, and to own surface land.(3) The question which Minister should be responsible for the work ofthe Mineral Development Commission should be further considered,when a report has been received from the Government organisation committee.(4)&apos; The question of the assessment and payment of mineral developmentcharges should be further considered when a report has been receivedfrom the Minister of Town and Country Planning.(5) The proposals for changes in mining taxation should be examined bythe Tucker Committee on the Taxation of Trading Profits.(6) The Minister of Fuel and Power should inform the House of Commons,before the Summer Recess, that His Majesty&apos;s Government accept themain recommendations of the Westwood Report and will introduce thenecessary legislation in due course.H.

INTRODUCTION

The Right Honourable H.T.N. GAITSKELL, C.B.E., M.P.,

Minister of Fuel and Power;

SIR,

1. WE WERE APPOINTED on 2nd August, 1946, with the following terms of reference:-

"To enquire into the resources of minerals in the United Kingdom, excepting coal, oil, bedded ironstone, and substances of widespread occurrence; to consider possibilities and means of their co-ordinated, orderly and economic development in the national interest, and to make recommendations in regard thereto."

2. The minerals* which we have interpreted as falling within our terms of reference belong to two main classes, namely, the metalliferous minerals and the non-metalliferous minerals. Included in the former class are the non-ferrous ores-tin, tungsten, lead, zinc and the iron ore haematite. Among the non-metalliferous minerals are barytes, china clay, fluorspar, gypsum and the others named below. We are not concerned with coal, the bedded iron, ore deposits of the Midlands and Yorkshire, the oil shale of the Lothians, nor with brick-earth, gravel, limestone and others which are described in our terms of reference as "substances of widespread occurrence". These are mostly worked on, or immediately below, the surface, and the operations are more in the nature of quarrying than of underground mining.* It will be convenient to be able to refer collectively in this Report to the minerals or mineral deposits which come under our terms of reference. We shall, therefore designate them as "Mineral Development Committee minerals" or, more shortly, as MDC minerals. Generally speaking, it is impracticable to devise a subdivision of the mineral industries other than coal which is wholly satisfactory, and it is as well to bear in mind that the line of demarcation chosen for the purposes of our terms of reference, although convenient in many ways, is unnatural and arbitrary on technical grounds.

3. The chief MDC minerals which we have investigated and which are at present being worked in Great Britain are:-

Metalliferous Non-metalliferous

Ores of:- Barytes.

Tin. Barium brines.

Tungsten. Witherite.

Lead. Fluorspar.

Zinc (exploration only). China clay.

Haematite iron ore. Ball clays.

Gypsum.

Anhydrite.

Salt.

Potash (exploration only).

Fullers&apos; earth.

Talc.

Serpentine.

Glass sand.

4. In addition to the above, however, there are occurrences of many other MDC minerals of lesser importance in Great Britain; some of these are still being worked in a small way or intermittently, and others no longer worked (e.g., copper ores) were important in the past Special

* Throughout this Report we use the term "mineral" in a non-scientific sense : that is, including all mineral substances extracted from the earth, whether or not they come within the scientific definition of a mineral. We use the term "mining" in the technical sense: that is, including underground, opencast, or other methods used to extract minerals from the earth.


mention might be made of the Occurrence of the strontium mineral celestite,at Yate, near Bristol, which, though relatively small, is still producing forthe home and export markets. The following is the list: -        : -MetalliferousOres of: &apos;  Copper.Antimony.Nickel.Cobalt.Manganese.Uranium and Radium.*Gold.Iron pyrites:* Arsenic.Beryl.Magnetite iron ore. -* At present being produced;Non-metalliferous*Calcite (calc-spar).*CelestiteVv &quot; -V*China stone.     v ;    5*Diatomite.Graphite.  -&quot;&quot;Mineral black.       r&amp;tumt*Ochre and Umber.      vK&apos;Mica.Magnesite. ^nim ;Felspar.^Serpentine and chromite:Few of these mdc minerals of lesser importance have been examined indetail since we felt that any information obtained would be unlikely to affect our main conclusions ; neither is it expected that new developments in futureof any of these minerals would be of great importance from the nationalpoint of view. ! VJ .M* sn&amp;y&amp;prtj5. We have not dealt with occurrences of uranium minerals in this countrysince these come Within the general responsibility of the Minister of supply as provided for in the Atomic Energy Act, 194$.  ; . * ,6. For convenience we also list below the chief of the remaining mineralsnow being worked in Great Britain, the bulk of which are mineral substancesof widespread occurrence; with bedded ironstone, coal and bil,; they are excluded from our terms of reference: - j ;tSand and Gravel.Building stones.Brick, tile and crudeclays.Slate.potteryLimestone and chalk.Dolomite. .,. . -,r.:a.      vRoadstones. ;Refractory  sands,  claysrocks.and7. There was some doubt in our minds as to whether one or two ofthe minerals in this list should have been covered by our enquiry ;-in par-ticular, the refractory raw, materials and roofing slate. On the whole,however, we felt that their general nature and mode of occurrence indicated that they should be excluded. It was also thought that although dolomite,a mineral of widespread occurrence, has also been used in the last fewyears in connection with a new process for the production of magnesiafrom sea water, it was undesirable for us to consider it on this account alone.We have not dealt with many occurrences in Great Britain of sand usedfor ordinary glass-making, since this is probably to be classified as a mineralof widespread occurrence. We felt an exception should be made, however,of an unusual occurrence of high-grade glass sand at Loch Aline, Scotland(para. 295).8. In direct value of production and manpower employed the mdc mineralsare of lsss importance than the &quot; substances of widespread occurrence &quot;which in turn are considerably less so than coal. Roughly speaking, therespective percentages are 3 per cent, 11 per cent, and 86 per cent. further details are given in the Table II (page 9). The present position regardingproduction and resources of mdc minerals is summarised in Table I, page 3.
9. On the question of resources still available, the mdC minerals are mainly in quite a different category from the &quot;substances of widespreadoccurrence&quot;. They are of restricted distribution and in most cases theresources lie underground and thus the estimation of their extent is usuallya matter of considerable difficulty. It is the possible exhaustion of resources!which in some cases may happen within a generation, and the need for newdiscoveries that must be the controlling factors in future policy.&apos; ;/;/ E&apos;iMDC MINERALS-^UNITED ;KINGpOtMStatistical Summary (based on year 1947)Vii: (Allfigures approximate: minerals of lesser importance omitted)		Production as		ResourcesMineral   ;i	Production	percentage of	Value of	(see	(tons)	domestic	; i production	index		consumption	( -7-at mine)	: below);:Tin concentrates (65% metal)	1,337 *	2-5	331,700	^;ic &quot; &apos;Wolfram concentrates (65%j			(*3             (fT    r&apos;ti&apos;l \    &apos;&apos;i &apos;	tungstic oxide, WO3.)     ...	66   ,	-   0 05	27,000	,     C 7&apos;&apos;iLead concentrates (80% metal)	4,000		216,000	honeZinc concentrates (45 % metal)	nil			&apos;   noneIron ore (Haematite)	460,000	;-&apos;,-.;-4-5!C, i-jj	700,000	&quot;; wi&apos;&quot;&quot;		(metal content)		Barytes............	80,000	70	400,000	B			(ground mineral)&apos;.

10. One. category of mdc minerals includes the non-ferrous ores (tin, lead,zinc, tungsten) -and some&apos; of the non-metalliferous minerals such as fluorspar(essential for steel-making), barytes and witherite. Proyed and probablereserves* of minerals in this category are not likely ; to last beyond about twenty years at the present rate of extraction, andinsohie cases very much less. These minerals are often referred to as, &quot;lode.&quot; minerals, (para. 38).Mining industries based on domestic, supplies of these minerals may sooncease unless new discoveries continue &quot;to be made or development resultsat existing mines continue to be satisfactory. Geological and mining informa-tion shows that prospects are favourable in some instances, but there is no certainty beyond a few years ahead.        &apos;J   :XA M;      !/:11. For reasons which we set out in more detail later in the Report, theamount of money spent in this country on searchingfor hew deposits of minerals in this category (with some exceptions) has -been- steadily deereas-ing for many years, and mines have been closing more rapidly than new ones have been opened. Some efforts to revive production were made during the War but there was little chance of success when the work hadnecessarily to be planned on a short-term basis and in most cases had tobe started from the beginning by trying to make new discoveries. A rela-tively high contribution to the national economy could&apos;be made by;indusftries mining the non-ferrous ores and minerals such as^fluorspar arid baiytesif substantial new deposits could be found,, as these minerals are the &quot; importsavers&quot;, and world supplies are being increasingly drawn upon. It wouldseem: only prudent to take all reasonable steps to search for and develdponeWisources of supply at home.12. Another category of mdc minerals, all of great importance at present,are the non-metallic minerals, salt, gypsum and anhydrite, china clay; -ballclays, and fullers&apos; earth. These minerals occur usually as regular beddeddeposits beneath the surface,. but frequently of considerable lateral extent and thickness (para. 40). China clay is art exception, the mode of occurrence!being peculiar to that mineral. In all cases, however, reserves for manyyears ahead are probable or at least can be proved relatively cheaply. while a good deal more information is needed fo;confirm existing resources,thereis no immediate prospect of shortage of reserves, perhaps for as far as fiftyor even one hundred years ahead. As a direct consequence, we find that large and flourishing undertakings have been built up on mineral occur-rences of this kind. It has been possible for the industries to plan ahead,and to provide the necessary capital to build and equip relatively large and expensive plants and installations knowing that operations can be foreseenover a long period.13. Nevertheless we have concluded that it is unwise, even in the caseof these non-metallic mineral industries, to assume that future operationscan proceed safely, particularly on&apos; an expanding scale, without someattempt being made now to assess the:implications of the drain on reserves,* Throughout this Report we use the terms &quot;proved&quot;, &quot; probable &quot; and &quot;possible&quot; inrelation to underground mineral reserves in a strictly technical sense defined as follows: &quot; Proved &quot;:-A mineral deposit which has been exposed on three sides, i.e., is blockedout and ready for extraction.&quot; Probable &quot;: A mineral deposit which has been exposed on two sides or sometimesone side only. .,. , ........ .-, - ,.&quot; Possible &quot;: A mineral deposit, the existence of which is inferred from geologicalevidence but which has not been exposed. t
whether it be related to diminishing resources or to other considerations such as claims of other land uses or inefficient working. Moreover, although there is no urgent necessity, as in the case of non-ferrous ores, for the discovery of new deposits of these bedded minerals, that possibility must not be overlooked. One important new mineral discovery in this group has occurred during the course of our enquiry. This is the confirmation of the existence in N.E. Yorkshire, at a depth of over 3,500 feet, of beds of potash salts recorded for the first time in this country a few years ago. Further details about the occurrence and its potentialities are given in chapter III. The economic significance of this discovery has yet to be determined, but its potential future importance cannot be overestimated as all our domestic requirements of potash salts are at present imported, chiefly from the Russian Zone of Germany, France, and, Palestine.

14. Previous official enquiries into the mineral industries (see Chapter VI) have anticipated some of our conclusions, a confirmation that certain of the industry&apos;s difficulties and deficiencies are of a long-standing nature. In one respect only, over a long period of years, has action been taken by the Government which in principle was designed to be of direct benefit and encouragement to the industry, and that relates to Income Tax. The Income Tax Act, 1945, removed an anomaly in the incidence of taxation whereby mining companies could not claim allowances on expenditure on assets of a wasting nature, e.g. shafts and crosscuts. This had long been claimed as unfair tax discrimination against mining and a deterrent to exploration and enterprise. The alteration must be regarded as an important and positive enactment for the encouragement of mineral development.

15. The additional incentive to mining companies to undertake mineral exploration which may have resulted from the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1945, has been offset by the application of the Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947, to mineral workings. The complications introduced into the mining industry by the incidental consequences of these Acts are referred to in Chapter VIII; in our opinion some further reforms are necessary if the mineral industry is to make real progress, otherwise there is a danger that the extinction of parts of it may be brought nearer.

16. A large part of our Report (Chapters II-V) is devoted to a summary of information we have been able to obtain about the mineral resources of the country. It was felt desirable to carry this part of our investigation as far as practicable as it is the first official enquiry made into this particular aspect of the mineral industry, and it provides a constructive approach towards a permanent mineral development policy. Unfortunately, as we have already indicated, the lack of specific information about reserves and related questions is greatest in the case of those minerals where an increase in output is most desirable; so much so that it is quite impossible in our view, as things stand at present, to attempt estimates as to what might or might not be achieved. All we can do is to recommend ways in which some at least of the present uncertainty about future production of these minerals can be removed. The merits of claims which are continually being made about potentialities of some of the districts where these minerals occur should be properly and scientifically examined while a nucleus of the industry still exists on which any expansion could be based, and while local knowledge and experience are still available.

17. For a similar reason we have not examined the problem of recruitment of mining labour, which would have to be satisfactorily resolved if


any large expansion of output was justified on technical grounds. In ourview this and other matters cannot at present be seen in their right perspec-tive and they should be left until the much more fundamental questions ofthe probable future value and likely extent of our mineral resources have been determined in greater detail. ......18. We decided not to undertake an investigation into certain questions concerning, for instance, such,matters as the control over production and marketing,, and more especially selling prices. The structure of certain of the non-metalliferous mining industries, however, suggests that in mattersof this kind the appropriate Minister, if he thinks fit, might ask the recentlyconstituted Monopolies Commission to carry put an investigation. h19. At the Minister^ request we have conducted three special enquiriessince our appointment which necessitated more detail investigations than our terms of reference envisaged; In so far as the conclusions of these enquiries are relevant they are now embodied in this Report.20. We appreciate that for many reasons it will be difficult for purrecommendations to be considered in relation only to&apos;the&apos;mdc minerals; oneof these is the arbitrary nature of the line of demarcation between mineralswe have considered and those outside our terms of reference.although we have framed our recommendations solely with regard to mdc minerals wehave ho reason to suppose that, apart from some of our recommendationsdealing directly with actual or, possible shortage of. resources, they wouldnot in general apply equally to bedded ironstone, oil shale, and the.mineralsubstances of widespread occurrence. This applies particularly to our recommendation regarding the nationalisation of mineral rights. It must be remembered, however, (that on the whole, we are dealing with smallerindustries and a very much smaller i land use problemk because&apos; the mineralworkings concerned are mainly underground and, very restricted, locally.21. Northern Ireland. We should like to take this opportunity of thankingthe Government. of Northern Ireland for. their assistance and co-operation in providing information regarding the resources of minerals and the possibili-ties of new discoveries in Northern Ireland. This information has enabled us to give a complete picture of the present position in this respect of theUnited Kingdom as as whole. While we should at once make it clear thatour recommendations are intended to apply only to Grea^ Britain, weshould like to make the comment that conclusions drawn from the study of the information available from. Northern Ireland give further support on technical grounds to our recommendations on the official steps which shouldbe taken in future to acquire further knowledge of our minerals and topromote development.    . - J22.

The implications of\Town and;C6hhl^rPlanmhgTegislation are-setbut ihn relation to mineral rights and mineral development. It is recommended-that&apos;the&apos;Town and Country&apos;Planning Acts; 1947, be amended to secure the unification of mineral rights and to leave theway open for a more positive mineral development, policy.;.CHAPTER IX PRINCIPLES OF FUTURE POLICY.The main conclusion of this chapter is that the Government; should assume a new role, largely technical in character, in order to acquireinformation about mineral resources and to undertake exploration where necessary, if this cannot or should not be undertaken by privateenterprise. The objects are to make new, discoveries,; to. encourageexploration, and development by the provision of information, and to- provide: adequate technical knowledge to ensure that reserves are workedefficiently. &apos;        . ..... 1CHAPTER X THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL INFORMATION. 5This chapter sets out in more detail the arguments in support ofa comprehensive survey of mineral resources of the country being undertaken as soon as possible, and the kind of work involved.r,i     CHAPTER XI-THE FUTURE &apos;ORGANISATION OF MINERAL DEVELOPMENT.A&apos; new permanent organisation, to be known as the &quot;-mineral development Commission &quot; is proposed. It should be mainly technicalin character and under the control of the Ministry of Fuel and Power.Mineral rights should be vested in it. Government responsibilities for mineral production, the functions of the Commission and suggestionsv &apos; as&apos; to its organisation and relationship to the Ministry of Fuel and power are discussed,: .7/ -u.a .T:&apos;, ; \     .. :- p- \m .CHAPTER XII SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS :;v   &apos;23. Throughout our enquiry we have received the utmost co-operation on the part of all those mining companies, institutions and other bodies,and individuals, Whom we have consulted. In no case have we been refusedthe information, technical or otherwise, for which we have asked.   A
formal list of those who have given evidence and assistance is set out in Appendix I. This cannot be complete, however, since during the course of our visits to the various mineral areas of the country we have met and discussed informally many problems with persons of widely different interests in the mining industry and profession. To all we extend our grateful thanks.

24. Special mention should be made of the services rendered to us by the Director (as an Assessor) and many other Officers of the Geological Survey and Museum (Department of Scientific and Industrial Research). Much of the geological information about mineral resources has been provided for us by that Institution, and we have been fortunate in having the company of its representatives in our visits in the field.

25. The services of other Government Departments have been at our disposal through Assessors whose help at different times and in many directions has been most valuable. The Departments are:-

Ministry of Town and Country Planning.

Scottish Office.

Board of Trade.

Ministry of Supply*.

Ministry of Works.

We have also gratefully to acknowledge assistance received from the Forestry Commission, the Board of Inland Revenue, the Central Land Board and Imperial Institute (Mineral Resources Department)

26. Our investigation in Scotland was undertaken by a special Sub-Committee constituted as follows:-

Mr. L. C. Hill (Chairman ; member of Mineral Development Committee).

Professor G. Hibberd (Royal Technical College, Glasgow)

Dr. M. Macgregor.

Mr. E. G. Willis, M.P. (member of Mineral Development Committee).

Mr. A. S. Butler, Department of Health, Scotland (Assessor).

Mr. T.H. Whitehead, Assistant Director, Geological Survey and Museum (Scottish Office)(Assessor).

We are greatly indebted to Professor Hibberd and Dr. Macgregor, and to Mr. Butler and Mr. Whitehead for giving up so much of their time, and for their invaluable assistance and advice.

27. Finally, we wish to place on record our appreciation of the painstaking and untiring efforts of our secretarial staff. Mr. W.C.C. Rose, our Secretary, has technical qualifications and considerable knowledge and experience of the mineral industries of the country, and the services he has rendered to us have been invaluable. Miss P. D. Scott (who has acted as Assistant Secretary) and Miss P. Beckerman have together been responsible for all the clerical work, including typing services, the demands for both of which have been heavy. During the latter stages of our investigation Mr. J. Simpson, who also has technical qualifications, gave considerable and valuable assistance to the Secretary.

* The Ministry of Supply kindly made available to us the reports and records of the Non-ferrous Mineral Development Control (Controller, Sir William J. Larke, K.B.E.) and of Non-ferrous Minerals Development Ltd. made during the War.

Although the mining of some non-ferrous ores, for instance, tin,copper and lead, has proceeded in this country for hundreds of years, itwas not until the early part of the last century that the industry assumedreal importance. An expanding market for base metals at this time resultedin all time records in home ore production being achieved during the period1850-1870. Thereafter, however, there was a gradual decline brought aboutmainly by the exhaustion of the more easily worked deposits and the fallin metal &quot;prices (pages 87-88) due to the development of more prolific andcheaper sources of supplies overseas. Tin and lead mining have continued on a reduced scale, but copper mining to all intents and purposes ceased inthe last century and is unlikely to be revived.
,33. Production of haematite iron ore has come mainly from WestCumberland and the Furness district of Lancashire, from the Forest of Dean.and from South Wales. The first-mentioned districts have been of far greater importance than the other two. As in the case of non-ferrousores, this, industry reached its maximum. production towards, the close ofthe i last century, since when output has declined to but a fraction. In1947 output of haematite iron ore was only 2 or 3 per cent, of total domesticiron\ore requirements. , For figures of haematite production see paras. 163and &apos;J74. jJsii&amp;?

The next two Chapters deal with--the mix:^ nuherals;separately,J-for england and Wales, and-for-Scotland respectively;&apos; In; Chapters III and TVthe minerals have been; dealt with &quot;in alphabetical order for easy&quot; reference.In addition, we have added as Chapter V a short summary of the information about the mineral resources of Northern Ireland, by permission of htheNorthern Ireland Government, thereby giving a fairly complete picture ofthe informational present,available?aboutthe;*moreimportant mdc mineral resources of the United Kingdom as a whole.35. Our objective in Chapters Illtand IV has been generally to examinethe-facts available regardingresources of minerals hr Great Britain&quot;,&quot;&quot; withparticular reference to the following considerations: &apos; (i) The technical evidence availaole;to justify the development or main-tenance of a profitable mining industry on a long-term basis,(ii) Where there are only indications sof mineral resources, those measures necessary&quot; to establish their existence in sufficient quantity and quality for economic exploitation. !*at-36. Wherever we have obtained evidence about the insistence of &quot;ferqv^d^reserves of minerals we have; given estimates of tonjn$gfes and graf^iq^--()fthe.&quot;life&quot; of the deposit.oh the basis oof present output. ; In auMOthercases we have been as specific as the evidence justified with regard to futurepossibilities. Throughout we have used&apos;the terms &quot; proved &quot;, &quot; probable^&apos;,and possible.&quot; in relation to ore reserves in the sense defined in ;thefootnote on page 4- u-:37. In referring to future possibilities, we have been mindful that theconditions under which mineral deposits are economic to work are continuallychanging. Low-grade deposits at present, unprofitable, to work may later-become of commercial importance if new methods of mining, mineralrecovery or treatment reduce operating costs. New uses may be found formineral products, or prices.may rise so that minerals useless today maybe valuable tomorrow. In, such cases, therefore, we have been more comceraed with establishing the existence of mineral deposits rather than withattempts to assess, except within very broad limits, their potential value.38. We have stated in the Introduction (para. 2) that the mdgminerals fall into two main groups, the metalliferous; and the non-metal-&apos;liferous minerals. &apos;: From the technical; point of view, the metalliferousminerals, together with certain non-metalliferous \ minerals, of whichbarytes, fluorspar and , witherite are the most; important, scanalso be described as the1&quot;lode&quot; minerals. They are of very restrictedgeographical distribution and usually, occur in; narrow and oftenhighly-inclined or! vertical &quot;veins which are frequently not visible at [the surface. The extent of the deposit, therefore, cannot be accurately determinedexcept by exploration and underground development. Moreover, the mineralcontent of the veins often changes ; the grade of the ore itself, and thereforeits value, is subject to constant variation,, Thus their location is diflficulUand their subsequent development and working carries with it a high degreeof risk. &quot; &apos;v ^39. In our investigations into the &quot; lode&quot; minerals,, the lack of precise information was found to be a serious stumbling block to the estimationof resources and their future importance. ; This could only be remedied&quot; bythe expenditure.of considerable sums of money on-exploration which, -in
conjunction with underground development of existing mines, might well lead to the discovery of further resources. At the moment, however, existing evidence about these minerals is only sufficient to say that proved reserves will last not longer than about twenty years on the present scale of output; in some the period is much less, and in the case of lead and zinc proved reserves are negligible.

40. The remaining MDC minerals, all non-metalliferous, tell a different story. The deposits of gypsum, anhydrite, fullers&apos; earth, ball, clays and salt are "bedded", that is, they occur generally as flat-lying deposits which have often considerable lateral extent and thickness. In most cases of the resources are large, are more easily determined, and the element of speculation attending their discovery and development is greatly reduced. They sustain a large, well-established and profitable industries which have been able to look ahead to a long-term existence based on relatively large reserves, and have thus not had to contend with the uncertainties facing the lode-mining industries. Although our information covering these bedded minerals is more precise and favourable from the future national point of view, we have nevertheless concluded that in detail it should be much more comprehensive. The development of these minerals from the long-term aspect is liable to be influenced to a greater extent than the lodge minerals by such factors as the claim of other land uses. To enable the resources to be fully utilised and to be developed with the maximum efficiency it is clear that a careful and detailed collection of technical information is needed so that long-term development plans can be prepared and the resources adequately safeguarded.

41. A rather different but equally important example is mentioned in the recently published Board of Trade Working Party Report on china clay, a mineral which is exceptional in its mode of occurrence. There is need for the integration of producing china clay units and for greater co-operation within that industry to ensure that deposits are efficiently worked. Otherwise there is a danger that a proportion-which might be large-of the resources still available might be sterilised, or rendered uneconomic or more costly to work (page 23).

42. We have included a short survey of occurrences of underground water in the South Northumberland Coalfield which contains barium chloride in solution. This is at present being worked at one colliery and is used as a source of barium for the preparation of "blanc-fixe" an important raw material for the paint industry. We draw attention to similar occurrences in neighbouring collieries and to the need for a proper examination to be made to ascertain if development on a larger scale is possible (page 18).

43. Special mention should be made of the potential importance of the discovery of potash brine and beds of potash minerals in North Yorkshire (page 44). Further exploration should be put in hand without delay to get more geological information about the thickness, distribution and composition of the potash salts and their associated minerals, and thus to determine their economic significance.

Research

44. An important conclusion to which we would draw particular attention is the urgent need for fostering research into mining, mineral dressing and processing problems and into the possibility of developing new uses for minerals and mineral products.


CHAPTER IIIMINERAL RESOURCES (ENGLAND AND WALES)&apos;(ANHYDRITE ^ SJ45. The most important source of supply of this anhydrous calcium sul-phate mineral at the present time is the Teeside area in N.E. England wherethe Billingham mine of T.C.I., Ltd., is probably the largest sin^eprpducerof anhydrite in the world. There the mineral occurs alone, but. in theEden Valley in Cumberland and Westmorland, the only other place whereanhydrite is being worked, and elsewhere in the ,U.K., anhydrite is foundin conjunction with gypsum, the hydrated form of calcium sulphate (para.141).Production46. Anhydrite production was commenced in 1926-27 when the Billing-ham mine was opened. In the course of the War, output was doubled from about 400,000 tons to 800,000 tons per annum, the main increase and indeedthree-quarters of the total production coming from that&apos;one /mine. Currentlythe production exceeds 900,000 tons per annum. &apos; . -History and Uses47. Anhydrite had little known commercial value prior to the develop-ment in Germany before the 1914-18 War of the Haber-Bosch method of fixing atmospheric nitrogen as ammonia and, the double decomposition pro-cess for making ammonium sulphate by the action of carbonated ammonialiquor on finely-ground anhydrite (or gypsum) whereby calcium carbonatewas precipitated and ammonium sulphate recovered from solution by evapora-tion. This process was developed as part of the German synthetic ammoniaindustry/&apos;-       - :. ufui^l. - ,.   ,&apos;. .&apos;&quot; ,       &apos;&apos;.t&quot;&apos;,&apos;-,48. Parallel research had shown that the&apos;mineral could also be used forthe manufacture of cement with the recovery *of sulphur in the kiln gasesfor sulphuric acid manufacture, but the large pyrites reserves in Germanyobviated any serious need for its furtherance. hl^p^&apos;&apos;^t49. These processes were made use of by I.G.I. Ltd.&apos;when borings putdown in 1926 for water at Billingham proved the presence of over 150 ft.of anhydrite in 5 main bands at depths between 650 and 950 ft. the synthetic ammonia plant on the site provided abundant quantities of ammoniaand carbon dioxide for the ammonium sulphate reaction and coke, supplies were also on hand nearby for the production of cement and the recovery of sulphuric acid.50. The second World War accentuated the importance of making bothsulphuric acid and &quot;ammonium sulphate from anhydrite Owing to the diffi-culties in obtaining supplies of foreign pyrites, and led to the anhydritepresent in the gypsum mines of the Eden Valley also being extracted forammonium sulphate manufacture at a Government factory erected at Prud-hoe-on-Tyne. This plant, as well as that at Billingham, has since been maintained at full production owing to the world shortage of nitrogenousfertilisers. -   .51. A small amount of anhydrite is used in making plaster.

Anhydrite (with gypsum) has also been recorded in bore-holesin the Furness district of Lancashire.Summary ;57. Resources of anhydrite in the Billingham area are likely to be at least75 million tons. Further large resources exist south of the River Tees;Many millions of tops of anhydrite are also known to be present in theEden Valley in Cumberland and Westmorland and also in West Cumber-land. It is clear that the resources are sufficient to meet requirements on present-day standards for many years.............

61. They are used in the pottery industry to impart plasticity and other properties to the bodies used for general earthenware sanitary ware, glazed and other tiles, electro-ceramics, porcelains and high-grade refractories, the particular use being determined by the properties of the individual clays. An important quantity of clay is now used in bonding abrasive wheels and blocks.

62. Broadly, the clays are divisible into three groups:-

(i) Black Clays-highly aluminous types, characterised by the presence of varying amounts of carbonaceous matter, chiefly of lignitic nature. In certain cases these clays approach low-grade lignites. These clays are found mainly in south Devon.

(ii) Blue Clays-highly aluminous types, coloured in various tints of red, brown, blue, grey, up to creamy white, the colour being determined by the amount and nature of the iron compounds present. These clays are found chiefly in Dorset, but also in north and south Devon.

(iii) Stoneware and Refractory Clays-Stoneware clays are characterised by high silica content (from 60 per cent upwards) the excess over that necessary for the clay mineral being present largely as quartz. These clays are also used largely for the manufacture of stoneware goods including drain pipes. Clays used in the refractories industries comprises not only certain stoneware clays but also blue and black clays of high iron content.

There is no essential relation between the colour of the raw clay and that of the fired product but the black and blue clays, usually known as "whiteware" clays, when fired to 1100-1200° C. give a product whose colour varies from white to cream.

Resources

63. There are three areas in which the clays occur in sufficient amount to be worked, namely:-

(i) South Devonshire, in the neighbourhood of Bovey Tracey and Newton Abbot, especially the latter.

(ii) North Devonshire, on the low-lying tract of country between the villages of Peters Marland, Meeth and Petrockstow in the Mere Valley-a tributary of the Torridge-10-15 miles south of Bideford.

(iii) Dorsetshire, around Wareham and Corfe Castle.

SOUTH DEVON

64. Clay working in this area is reported to have begun about 1730. The area in which the clays occur is roughly a narrow ellipse extending from Bovey Tracey down to Newton Abbot and having an overall area of 18-20 sq. miles. The main workings are situated on the S.E. margin near Kingsteignton under a cover of up to 30 ft. of Recent sand and gravels. As many as 30 clays beds ranging from 1 to 11 ft. in thickness are recorded but they are often highly distorted and discontinuous. Geologically the beds occur in a basin, the depth of which has been proved to be at least 700 ft.

65. The reserves of whiteware clay in the area are very great. The clay appears to run at about 1,500 tons/acre ft. which, assuming an average thickness of 10 ft. of workable clay over the southern half of the basin


50 per cent, extractable, indicates a workable reserve of the order of50 million tons. . The reserves of stoneware claysb are: far in excess ofthis figure. HiViQbi^ \- /^Jrni-vvxj-v^ryJri v&amp;\ifiS!;:: north devon  ,   \   ;, &apos;-y-&apos; ....    \^66. The low-lying tract of the Mere Valley between Peters Marland,Meeth and Petrockstow contains workable clays over a length of 4^ milesby J mile wide, i.e., about 3J sq. miles. The beds are in a basin and in places plunge steeply, especially on the N.E: margm, flattening out in thecentral areas. These clays have been worked since the middle of the 18thcentury. &apos;*67. The reserves of whiteware and stoneware clays are; probably com-paratively large, &quot;as in the two localities which are being worked boringshave proved the presence of several workable beds at shallow depths. Ingeneral the nOrth Devon whiteware1 clays tend to be :more siliceous thanthose of south Devon and Dorset/ kmdorset    i buji .tli&apos;JQ,fj    -68. Plastic clays have been worked in the neighbourhood of Warehamand Poole Harbour for over two centuries, the latter: district being especiallynoted for its &quot; pipe-clays &quot; where sections of the main bed have a thicknessupwards of 25 ft. \-;i   &quot;-^ 1   snwpie69. Annual outputs for many years past have been over 100,000 tons,and the proved reserves of clay exceed 4 million tons, Whilst the probablereserves are very much greater; for example there are strong grounds forbelief that an area west of Corfe Castle, at present requisitioned by ,theWar Office, contains reserves perhaps amounting to 10 million tons.    ;;Summary70. The reserves of the most valuable whiteware clays probably exceedall predictable home and export trade requirements for as much as 50 years.Those of stoneware clays are probably even greater. It should be noted,however, that these are estimates based mainly on indications only andthat the reserves cannot be considered proved in the accepted mining sense.Having regard to the variability of the beds, both in thickness and extent in certain areas, and other complicating geological factors, there wouldseem to be every reason to seek confirmation of the extent of the indi-cated reserves by boring or other means. In particular, further informa-tion should be obtained about the exact distribution of the deposits in orderthat, where necessary, working could be planned on a long-term basis.BARIUM BRINES71. The presence of barium chloride in the waters encountered in someof the collieries in S.E. Northumberland and adjacent parts of Durham, has long been known, but their economic exploitation is confined to the Back worthColliery of the Northern Division of the National Coal Board situated about10 miles N.E. of Newcastle-on-Tyne.72. At this colliery a portion of the mine waters carry 0.7 per cent,barium chloride in addition to 6 per certt. of sodium chloride and a small amount of calcium chloride. They are pumped from the lowest level ofthe pit to surface storage tanks, from which they are drawn off, filteredand treated with sulphuric acid when barium sulphate is precipitated ^andhydrochloric acid generated ; this acid is then employed to convert purchasedwitherite into additional barium chloride for the sulphate reaction.
73. This process at the present time is being operated to yield an annualtotal of about 3,50Q tons of high-grade, precipitated barium sulphate (blancfixe), two-thirds by direct conversion of the brine salt and one-third roughlyfrom the, resultant hydrochloric acid reaction with witherite.Summary74. The economic merits of this process warrant; its application wheresimilar mine waters occur, for which purpose we agree that steps shouldbe taken to carry out a detailed survey of the occurrence of such watersin this area, and an estimation of their volume and precise mineral content.BARYTESOccurrence r/i-s...       y-;t75. The mineral barytes, known also as barite (BaSOJ, has been foundin economic quantities in veins in the Northern Pennines, the DurhamCoalfield, Devonshire, the Lake District, Derbyshire, Shropshire, North and central Wales and Somerset. Present production comes mainly from minessituated in the first four mentioned districts although a considerable quantityof second grade product is recovered in Derbyshire from old lead-miningdumps. Barytes, like fluorspar, is often associated as a &quot;gangue&quot; mineralwith lead and zinc ores. ...; - .   :&apos; \--\&apos;:&apos;^       &quot;;76. For information on the geology of barytes occurrences in Englandand Wales we&apos; have relied mainly upon a recent publication of H.M.Geological Survey.*Uses . -&apos;&apos;;r-V,&apos;&apos;&apos; \v,M\ io77. When, barytes has been freed from impurities and finely ground, itsindustrial uses depend upon one or more of three properties, namely chemicalinertness.,white colour,and high, specific gravity. Its main use is as anextender in, paint, and as a filler for linoleum,: rubber, paper and textiles.Off-colour barytes is. used to. make up heavy &apos;mud in oil well drillingand a heavy medium; for the sink-and-float type of coal washing process.Barytes has also important chemical uses, the chief of which is as a rawmaterial for the preparation of blanc fixe and lithopone and in certaintitanium pigments used in the paint industry.Production *;v!LbHbf&apos;T? ^simf) mmxsofl78. The commercial importance of barytes became rbcOj^hised in the latter half of the last century. From about 1860 to 1900 production in theUnited Kingdom averaged 20,000 tons per annum which satisfied domesticrequirements. Thereafter both production and demand expanded rapidly and in the 20 years preceding 1939 figures for which averaged 50,000 tonsand 90,000 tons per annum respectively, the balance of demand was met by imports. During the 1939-45 War, when imports practically ceased, pro-duction was expanded to about 90,000 tons per annum which satisfiedessential demands. Production has since dropped to about 80,000 tons perannum. Imports have recommenced and exceeded 15,000 tons of ground and unground mineral in 1947.* &quot; Barium Minerals in England and Wales&quot; Wartime Pamphlet No. 46, GeologicalSurvey and Museum, 1945.

SHROPSHIRE AND MONTGOMERYSHIRE

82. At present Huglith mine and certain small mines in the same area near Sallies are producing small quantities of barytes. Proved reserves are negligible from the long-term point of view and there is no evidence to suggest that any significant tonnage of ore which can be classified either as "probable" or "possible" is known. Geological evidence suggests that one or two abandoned mines in this area might contain further ore bodies, but to confirm this would need heavy expenditure on re-opening mines and on exploration, the prospects of which must be classed as highly speculative.

NORTHERN PENNINES

83. (a) Closehouse. Reserves are reported to be 80,000 tons of which 50,000 tons are proved. The mine has considerable unexplored possibilities and so far working has only extended to 100 ft. in depth.

(b) Cowgreen. Proved reserves in this mine together with the adjoining Dubby Sike amount to about 150,000 tons (40 per cent. BaSO) with an equal quantity of probable reserves. Other veins in the vicinity are at present being explored and it can be stated with confidence that at least another 100,000 tons of barytes, the grade of which has not yet been ascertained, can be classed as probable. There is evidence to suggest that prospects generally on a number of veins in this vicinity are favourable and that cases at least in some further exploration would be likely to give promising results.

(c) Silverband. Probable reserves amount to about 150,000 tons of which roughly half can be regarded as proved. Prospects of this tonnage being increased are favourable and exploration is in hand, but there are difficulties to be overcome in mining and in securing a satisfactory recovery of high-grade barytes from the ore bodies, which are of the replacement type with a content of barium sulphate not in excess of 50 per cent.

(d) Hartside. This mine is still in the exploration stage, and although an important tonnage of barytes has been proved, its long-term importance cannot yet be said to be established.

(e) Longfell. Probable reserves amount to about 100,000 tons of which a quarter is proved. Future prospects are uncertain, and although new ore-shoots are liable to be pockety, a considerable area favourably situated on geological grounds still remains to be explored.

(f) New Brancepeth Colliery. Probable reserves amount to 300,000 tons of which over 100,000 tons are proved. A large part of this tonnage will average 90 per cent. grade. In addition there are good prospects that development of the present ore-shoots both laterally and in depth would reveal a much larger tonnage, possibly at least equal to that already proved and probable. Other ore-shoots of barytes have been found in the same vein in the ground opened up and worked by an adjacent colliery. These deposits are now inaccessible but they could be approached through the New Brancepeth Colliery workings where barytes is being worked as a subsidiary undertaking to that of coal-mining, with only the higher grade barytes being extracted. This is clearly uneconomical and wasteful, and if the fullest advantage is to be taken of this large deposit (which has probably as great a potential importance as any barytes occurrence in the U.K.), steps should be taken to ensure that the development of the barytes is undertaken as a separate project from coal-mining as soon as possible.

DEVONSHIRE

84. Bridford Mine. We have been informed that recent estimates made after a re-examination of the property on behalf of the Management show


that probable and possible ore reserves are of the order of one million tonsin the mine and in adjacent land where the existence of other veins has beendeduced from mining records and geological evidence. Present rate of pro-;duction is about 12,500 tons per annum, but an output of over 23,000 tons was attained irt 1940. The Management are now (1949) planning to raise theoutput to a figure between 25,000 and 40,000 tons per annum in two year&apos;s time. It is reasonable to suppose, therefore, that the mine should be ableto operate at the planned rate of output for many years. Diamond drilling ^is now in hand to strengthen knowledge of reserves.    . --v&apos;-^&apos;,DERBYSHIRE85. Some of the old lead mine dumps, in Middleton Dale are extensive ^and contain upwards of a million tons of material with a BaSO^ content waveraging 35-40. per cent. The material which is obtained by the treat-ment of these dumps,&apos; however, is &quot; off-colour&quot; and has restricted indusrtrial use. From the point of view of the main uses of barytes, therefore;these dumps are of limited importance although there is no doubt that theycontain sufficient mineral to enable them to continue to be worked on thepresent scale, perhaps for 20 years. So far as is known, reserves of barytesin mines in Derbyshire are small and while there is evidence suggesting that new deposits may well be discovered, the prospects must be regarded asuncertain.LAKE DISTRICT86. Potts Ghyll Mine. So far as is known, proved and probable reservesdo not amount to much more than would support one or two year&apos;s operation on the present scale Of output. Future prospects generally in this minemust be regarded as uncertain from the long-term, point of view, until agreat deal more exploration has been undertaken, both laterally and in depth.        ;;;&apos;,;&quot;.Future Prospects87. It would be reasonable to assume that the known life of many ofthe present producing mines will be further extended in the ordinary courseof development beyond that indicated by existing reserves. Furthermore anumber of the smaller mines now in the early stages of development will no doubt prove in course of time to contain more extensive deposits than could be inferred from available evidence. &apos;88. There is a strong probability, therefore, that given the right incentivesand providing the present level of profitability is at least maintained, theindustry, by its own efforts, will show in the course of time that resourcesexist which will considerably extend the period of its life, though there canbe no certainty about this. ,89. If an attempt is made; to carry this conclusion further the historyof the industry, supported by existing geological evidence, suggests that new occurrences of barytes are likely to be discovered within existingproducing areas. It must be emphasised, however, that from&apos; the- natureof the mineral occurrences and their irregularity, it by no means follows that such new discoveries would enable the present production level ofthe industry to be kept up when the resources how known become exhausted.90. The intensive search which has been carried out in recent years for new occurrences of barytes has in many cases been undertaken by companies with adequate financial resources to carry the risks involved and who have
had every intention of developing any new source discovered:1 This^suggeststhat the field in which new discoveries might be made is becoming muchn^re ^trictied and ,that any future^exploratory&quot;schemesy if they are libhave any chance of success, will demand substantial1 &quot;expenditure and willhave to be planned on a thoroughly scientific basis. It must be addedthat they - will also Carry5 a correspondingly greater risk of-failure! than-inthe past.91. From the foregoing it would be reasonable to assume that theindustry can continue as at present, ;so far : as: resources are concerned, ,upto twenty years with a fair probability of a decade or so thereafter. Acondition attaching to the last part of this statement would be that itwill - be necessary in; the future to initiate new exploratory schemes withthe object of replacing resources which are rapidly becoming exhausted: si92. We have considered the possibility that, as in the case of fluorspar,reserves of barytes might foe more economically exploited for the.benefitof the industry and of the Nation if central treatment plants could beestablished at suitable places in the- different districts where barytes ismined. Generally speaking, however,! the situation * of the individuali minesdoes hot as yet suggest that any advantages would be obtained by theadoption of this proposition. &apos;Summary93. From an examination of the figures given above of proved and probable reserves, and taking into account those cases, e.g., New Brancepethand Bridford, where an estimate of possible reserves can be made with someconfidence, it appears:  svm      . - , ,(i) that resources of crude barytes in excess of 2,000,000 tons inEngland and Wales are reasonably assured in mines now operating,(ii) that this tonnage, making an allowance for mining and concentra-tion losses is likely to be able to support an output equivalent in quality and quantity to that now being obtained for a periodof up to about twenty years.  ?; ;r;;    vv;;f&quot;CHINA CLAY94. China clay deposits of economic^ importance in the United Kingdomoccur only in the granite masses of parts of Cornwall and Devon, the mostimportant areas being those of St. Austell, Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor.China clay is also found near Land&apos;s End in the Carn Marth and St. Germoegranites but has not been worked for some years in those places.95. The clay has been formed by the alteration (kaolinisation) of partsof the granite by solutions emanating from depths in the earth&apos;s crust,and thus it is probable that the china clay will persist to greater depthsthan have hitherto been reached in the deepest pits.China Clay Industry96. China clay has been worked, so far as is known, since 1755. Theindustry was built up largely by the growth of private and family concernseach operating a single pit. The rapid increase in the number of pits,especially in the St. Austell area during the last century, and particularly the growing importance of exports of china clay and of foreign competition,brought about the need for some, of these separate concerns to amalgamate.
In 1932 this culminated in the formation of English, Qlays Lovering EochinjACo. Ltd., an undertaking which. now controls&apos;75 ,per cent, of output, and20 out of a total of 29 operating finns in. the industry. There are inexistence  $&amp;u )Jri^owns 82. The, formation/of. this Company has also resulted in the integrar.tion,ot production into a fewer number of; pits, a policy/which , me Boa^iof Trade Working Party on china clay thought should be continued if /the,resources of china clay are to be properly safeguarded and their effective iand economic;!jdevel6jpmeht facihtated in the future^ sThe total number of firms;&apos;at present operatihg china ciay pits is 25,&apos; and apart from E.G.L.P.,19 own a single unit and four own % to 4; units each.^ vjirwj qj97.

Uses

101. China clay, by reason of its white colour and inert nature, is used as a filler in the paper and other industries including rubber, paint, etc. It also supplies the essential raw material for pottery, etc.

102. The following industries comprise the main users of china clay (shown in alphabetical order):-

Asbestos products. Medicinal preparations.

Cement industry. Paint industry.

Chemical industry. Paper industry (coating and filling).

Foundries and steelworks. Pottery industry.

High temperature refractories. Rubber industry.

Linoleum and oil industry. Synthetic abrasives.

Manufacturers of pottery refractories. Tile industry (high grade)

There are also a large number of miscellaneous industries.

103. In the U.K. trade it has been estimated (Working Party Report) that last year, out of a total demand for 323,000 tons of clay, approximately 50 per cent. Would be needed for paper making and 20 per cent. for pottery.

Resources

104. The Working Party Report states that at the rate of production of about 1 million tons of china clay a year, resources in Cornwall and Devon would last at least for 100 years if efficiently developed. This excludes possible future discoveries in areas where china clay has not yet been worked. The main basis for this statement is that the superficial extent of the china clay occurrences is fairly well-known, kaolinisation being more intense in the western and south-western portions of the granite masses where generally speaking, well-sited pits have not yet been bottomed. The mode of origin of the china clay suggests, furthermore, that deposits will persist in depth and that its quality is not likely to deteriorate; in fact kaolinisation has been proved at depths greater that those in the deepest pits.

105. The Working Party draw attention to the way in which the availability of the unworked clay, and the cost of its extraction, would be affected by the inefficient working, and to difficulties, especially in the St. Austell area, of finding sufficient space at the surface for tipping waste material. In the past, such sand dumps have often covered workable china clay. The annual production of 1 million tons of clay means that provision must be made to dump 3-4 million tons of sand each year. It is clear, therefore, that assuming the industry continues for another 100 years the problem is a major one.

106. They also point out the need for the unification of mineral rights, not only to meet this difficulty, but also to ensure that if clay is to be followed to greater depths, it will be possible to provide that those pits from which the resources can best be developed at these greater depths have the necessary room for lateral expansion.

107. Although adequate resources of china clay are likely to exist for our future needs for many years to come, the development of the industry, as suggested by the Working Party, will have to be planned well ahead in order that the resources can be worked economically and without restriction.

108. In certain cases it is suggested that surveys should be carried out in order to delimit more accurately by boneholes or other means the extent of the deposits in order that a development programme can be properly planned.


109. Reserves of the highest quality paper-filling china clay in the St.Austell district are .restricted-to one or two pitsand ^accordingly may belimited for economic reasons when opencast- mining: is carried below a certain .depth. On this account it is important that research akeadyi under wayshould be encouraged in order to ascertain whether a, method could be developed for beneficiating the medium and lower grades,of china clay toreplace the higher qualities if necessary. Close co-operation with, the paper and pottery industries is also highly desirable in order to make the mostof this valuable raw material by agreeing upon a scheme for standardisation of clay grades in keeping with the;real mineralogical and chemical require-ments of the major users. -f&apos;y- - &apos;:&quot;&quot;       &apos;yv\&apos; \110. In the Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor areas. where the china claydeposits at present being worked are more isolated the difficulties of lateralexpansion of pits is not present to the same degree.111. Both on Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor as well as St. Austell thereare many pits situated in good china clay ground which are at present notbeing worked and are being maintained as reserves. In the Lee Moor area,on Dartmoor, the E.C.L.P. Co. has a lease over 2,000 acres of land which includes the famous Lee Moor Pit. They intend shortly to step up pro-duction from this ground to the rate of 100,000 tons a year. There is everyindication on Bodmin Moor and on Dartmoor that ample reserves existfor 100 years.at the present rate of production.Siimmary.112. We accept generally the conclusion of the Working Party aboutreserves, and would draw particular attention.to the recommendations madewith a view to ensuring that the, deposits can continue to be workedeconomically and efficiently. Although the actual deposits of china clayappear to be ample, there may well be an economic limit in depth to whichthe pits can be carried unless measures are adopted at an early date tointegrate production, mechanise operations to reduce costs, I and to achieve a permanent solution of the problem of sand disposal, which is becomingurgent. \COPPER ORES&quot;113. During the early part of the 19th century over 50 per cent;of theworld&apos;s output of copper ores was contributed from mines in Cornwall andDevonshire, and from one or two other parts of the country, chiefly Anglesey,Cheshire and the Lake District. After I860 the output from all sourcessteadily declined, mainly due to the discovery of larger deposits of copperores in South America, Mexico and the U.S.A., and because the richer partsof the ore bodies in this country were exhausted. The steady decline in output is well shown in Table IV on page 11.114. According to the statistics available the maximum output from Corn-wall was 185,000 tons in the year 1854, and the metal content of the orewas 14,100 tons. Generally speaking, the districts where copper ore was found correspond broadly to those also famous as tin producers, the chiefdistrict again being that of Carn Brea (para. 236). Other important copperproducing districts are Levant, Gwennap, St. Austell, Caradon and Tavistock(Devon Great Consols was at one time an important copper mine).    In* The information contained in this section is based largely oh the &quot; Special Reports onthe Mineral Resources of Great Britain &quot; Memoirs of the Geological Survey.
25Anglesey the chief mine was the famous Mona &amp; Parys Mine which ceasedproduction many years ago, but from which a small production of pre-&quot;cipitated copper is still obtained. At one period (about 150 years ago)this mine was reputed to be-the largest copper mine in the world. InCheshire the occurrences of copper ores wene unusual in that they werereplacements of sedimentary rocks and not lodes as in the other districtsdescribed. The chief locality was Alderley Edge.115. Several localities are known in the Lake District where copper hasbeen worked, the most important mine being that of Coniston. other districts where copper ores have been found and worked are Staffordshire(Ecton Mine being at one time a relatively large producer), Derbyshire,Shropshire, Yorkshire, Central and North Wales and the Isle of Man.116. After, reviewing the evidence and records available, we came to theconclusion that a detailed examination of the resources of copper ores was hardly justified because v on general grounds it seems most unlikely thatany revival of copper ore production could take place which would be ofnational long-term importance. There is no doubt /that all the richerknown deposits of Cornwall, which was by far the most important copperproducing district,&apos; have&quot;,been exhausted,, and there is ho evidence that anysubstantial new deposits are likely , to be discovered. It must also beremembered that at present the copper production of the world comes fromrelatively few but important mining districts in which most of the^smeltingfacilities are concentrated. At the present time there are no facilities forsmelting large tonnages of copper ore in Great Britain.&apos;;&apos; fluorspar &apos;117. The mineral fluorspar, or fluorite (CaFa), is found in economicquantities in veins or irregular replacement deposits in association with lead and zinc ores in parts of Derbyshire, the Northern Pehnihes (Weardale area,Co. Durham) and north-west Yorkshire. Up till about 1890,it was regardedonly as a gangue mineral and was left in the mines by the. old miners ordiscarded on the tip heaps as of no economic value. Nowadays, however,it is an essential mineral raw material in steel-making, and it also supplies theonly economic source of the element fluorine in this country, the compoundsof which are becoming increasingly important in the chemical industry^Fluorspar is also found in other mineralised areas of the country, e.g.Cornwall, North Wales and West Cumberland; there has been a small property -duction from Cornwall in the past but generally deposits in these areas and elsewhere are unlikely to be of economic importance and can be disregardedfor present purposes. ,Production and &quot;Uses118. Present production comes from old lead mines re-opened for fluorspar,from veins in the lead mining areas containing mainly fluorspar, and (largely in Derbyshire and north-west Yorkshire) from dumps from old lead workings.In some cases in Derbyshire (e.g. High Rake) the waste material containingfluorspar resulting from the working of lead veins has been filled back intothe mine workings so that it can only now be recovered by open-cast orunderground mining.
119. Output from all sources is at present (1948-49) around 55,000-60,000tons per annum, and according to the British Fluorspar Producers&apos; Assbeia-tion will increase to64,000 tons, estimated as follows:-        &apos;   --tr-Smm^Grade&apos;&quot; IWaFi content) - Tons per. annum.up tb 75 per cent. ...      &quot; 19,250 t    .   ^-ft-75/80 per cent. ..V;      8,500 &quot; &apos;v:&quot;&apos;V. *&apos;\4&quot;&apos;&apos;j;&apos;:&quot;\- &quot;80/85 per cent.  -  ... -u-):\^   22,000&quot; ^$m^90/95 per cent.     ...     ...     ...       2,800over 95 per cent.   ... *H..?.J      2,000   BWn*K**&quot;Flotated&quot;* ; ^&apos;     ...       9;000  (increasing!to 14,000 : !... -  : ;-   -&apos; f! &quot; &apos; tons during ;1949):Spar up to85 per cent, grade usually contains up to 10 per ;&apos;Cent;!&apos;silica;and-is sold mainly as a flux for metallurgical purposes, cWefly&apos;5fe!&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;Steel!&apos;woirks;/&apos;Higher grades of spar are used in the non-ferrous and ceramic industries,but the bulk of the &quot; flotated &quot;* spar, which is over !95-per cent: gradeiahdcontains a minimum amount of silica ;C&apos;acid^radbyspar;&apos;&apos;)f as soldi for:chemical purposes, chiefly for the manufacture of hydrofluoric acid;   v/fe&amp;ri-120.

It is understood, however^ that; two new sources of supply of acid grade spar will shortly be available in Weardalewhere flotation plants are now in course of construction. About 85 percent, of production Of metallurgical spar comes from Derbyshire ; and theremainder from Durham. Production from hbrthiwest Yorkshire is small(about 500 tons p.a.). &apos;      -   -Reserves121. Several years&apos; supply of fluorspar still remain in many of the depositsat present being worked and also, according to existing information, else wherein the mineralised districts. There are, however, many difficulties bothtechnical and otherwise, preventing precise estimates being made.

Another importantconsiderationis the difficulty of deciding: at:kwhat)level of working costs and selling prices a particular mineral deposit of average or low grade will become ^economic to, work. From the nationalpoint of view, however, such deposits clearly have a potential value and - their future importance will be enhanced as new and improved processes of mineralrecovery become available.       / &quot; \-     m&quot;-. -  -na i123. The estimates of reserves given below have been drawn up in con-junction with H.M. Geological Survey ; they are based on figures supplied tous by individual members of the British Fluorspar Producers Association,&apos;and from data obtained as the result of a re-survey of the producing areas by the Geological Survey during the last few years. The classification ;bfrthe-reserves, by reason of the diverse nature of the information available, of theoccurrences themselves, and of the standards used by individual producers,has been difficult, and in most cases represents a compromise, with thebalance weighted if anything on the conservative side. Generally-theltate ofdevelopment of the mines does riot permit a useful distinction being made between &quot;proved&quot; and &quot;probable&quot; reserves, so these categories have beencombined. The estimates cover all the important occurrences known inEngland and Wales, reduced to a basis of 100 per cent, purity CaF^ content,* This is a term at present used by fluorspar producers to signify fluorspar concentratedby the flotation process.

126. Taking the foregoing factors into consideration, but excluding exportpossibilities, we estimate:-    ;rf &apos; ?/:&apos;\ &apos; :r\:&apos; )(i) that 500,000 tons of fluorspar of present-day saleable grades isprobable, and that an additional ,500,000 tons is possible.    ; j:;(ii) that this would be roughly equivalent to 15 years supply for theU.K. industries at an annual consumption rate of 65,000 tons.127. There are indications of the existence of many other fluorspardeposits which, if developed, might be sufficient to last the industry: fora much longer period, but the absence of definite information, the supplyof which would entail expenditure of considerable siiihs of money ohexploratory work and testing, makes any estimate of their exact valueentirely speculative. y    O ismmmh 6v;j ;;,.ir&apos;v::yi &apos; pFuture development of the industry128. In the ordinary course of business, the present mining companies would no doubt continue development and would transfer their operations to new deposits when existing sources become exhausted. Some of the more promising and less costly exploratory projects which, are indicated ongeological evidence, therefore, will be put in hand in the ordinary courseof events. There are other large exploratory projects, however, where the element of speculation is high, which might not prove sufficiently attractive to private enterprise under present conditions and it will be on the successful outcome of these that the long-term, future of the industry will depend.129. Generally speaking, the fluorspar deposits in this country are not of large individual extent and the industry has been built up of small minesneeding little capital outlay on exploration, development and plant. Asthe richer and better-known deposits become exhausted greater financial resources will be needed to facilitate new projects, and exploration willhave to be more scientifically planned.130. In the case of concentration plants, the exhaustion of richer deposits,and the increasing demand for a higher grade product (and particularly for acid-grade spar) will demand more efficient equipment, employingflotation and other modern means of mineral concentration in a greater number of cases than at present. Further developments in mineral dressingtechnique of this kind are also desirable in the national interest to conserveresources. At present a large proportion, sometimes as much as 50 percent, of the fluorspar mined at some localities is being lost. In this respect the British industry as a Whole is much behind those of the U.S.A. and(in 1939) Germany. This is not necessarily a criticism of the Britishindustry as mining conditions are not strictly comparable, but it is indicativeof the fact that the organisation of the British fluorspar industry, basedon small mines and undertakings, tends to restrict capital expenditure oneconomic grounds. Many of the British mines could not afford a modernplant of the technical efficiency necessary to ensure maximum recovery of a high-grade product.131. It is clear that to conserve remaining resources of fluorspar and reduce overall costs considerations will have to be given to the establishmentby the industry of centralised treatment plants, perhaps on the customsmill principle. This would involve a greater degree of collaboration withinthe industry than has existed to date. The efficiency of the industry andits, future development would also be assisted if a greater degree of standardisation could be obtained in the requirements of metallurgical sparfor the steel industry.
Summary132. Evidence of reserves of fluorspar in; England and Wales is insuffi-,cient to enable reliable estimates to be made. Our examination has shownthat proved and probable reserves (CaF2 basis) total about 280,000 tons andthat, in addition, possible reserves of about 350,000 tons exist. Geologicalevidence also suggests that a further 650,000 tons of resources might befounds/in. the neighbourhood of existing mines but that- at the momentirifonhatioh is insufficient for this figure t01;be regarded as-ahythihg &quot;ihorethan speculative, and it would appear^ that 15, years ;but hot more than&apos;20years supply can be foreseen. The position, therefore, cannot be: regardedas anything but serious. ^^&quot;^/^v rn&apos; W^^0&apos;.?.?? .- y-133. In this industry steps should be taken&apos; to improve dressing facultiesas at present much fluorspar is lost in the course of treatment and resourcesof fluorspar too low-grade to work might be found profitable in future. Weconsider-that steps should be taken to erect modern central dressing plantsat suitable points in the mining.fields, or-to modernise existing plants.&apos;i,FULLERS&apos; EARTH134. At the present time three occurrences of fullers&apos; earth in this country are being worked. One of these is at Nutfield, Surrey, &quot;and a secondnear Bath, both of which are worked by the Fullers&apos; Earth Union, Ltd.A third and probably much smaller deposit at Baynards in Sussex is workedby F. W. Berk &amp; Co. Ltd.135. Other occurrences are known at Woburn in Bedfordshhe, andMaidstone in Kent. The former was worked on a considerable scale in thelast century and earlier. Smaller occurrences of fullers&apos; earth, probably of little economic importance, have been noted from time to time in different parts of the country and at one locality in the Isle of Man.Production and Uses136. The Fullers&apos; Earth Union, Ltd., produced about 44,000 tons perannum of natural (dried) earth from Nutfield in 1948, and they plan to expandthis production when more mechanical equipment can be obtained. AtBath 17,000 tons of (dried) earth were produced in 1948. Annual pro-duction by F. W Berk &amp; Co. Ltd. is 2,000-5,000 tons. The fullers&apos; earthin the Nutfield and Baynafds area is produced by opencast methods andat Bath by underground mining. About 75 per cent, of production of natural earth from Nutfield is treated by a process developed by the Fullers&apos;Earth Union, the product now being sold mainly under the trade name&quot; Fulmont&quot;, which is described by the company as activated earth for thedecolorizing of vegetable and mineral oils. In addition the Company prO-duces the trade-marked earths &quot;Fulbond&quot; and &quot;Fulbent&quot;, the formerbeing a war-time development especially for use in foundry sand mixtures,and the latter a thixotropic product finding its principal use in oil-welldrilling mud, in which it satisfactorily replaces the bentonite earth fromWyoming, U.S.A. Neither of these trade-marked products is of the acid-activated type.137. Messrs. F. W. Berk &amp; Co. Ltd., produce &quot; Distribond &quot;, a product saidto have similar characteristics to &quot;Fulbondthe greater part of their production, however, is used as pesticides and soil dressings.138. The chief uses of fullers&apos; earth are for oil refining, in foundrysands, for well-drilling muds, and for certain other uses such as &quot;fulling&quot;31
in the textile industry, and in pharmacy; also in the manufacture of pencils and pigments and as a catalyst. Activation of fullers&apos; earth has enormously increased its use and efficiency in Oil refining.

Reserves

139. (a) Nutfield, Surrey. The deposit outcrops between Redhill and Nutfield and averages 10 ft. thickness in the quarries now being worked. Geological information indicates that the fullers&apos; earth occurs as a bed dipping generally to the north. The Fuller&apos;s Earth Union Ltd. have carried out extensive boring which indicates that the fullers&apos; earth bed becomes thin and deep towards the north and east. Although the Company&apos;s output from this deposit exceeds 40,000 tons per annum the proved reserves are equivalent to many years supply of the raw material. This is on the assumption that the area underlain by these reserves will be available for mineral working. Owing to the increasing depth, ultimate extensions northwards may involve underground working.

(b) Somerset (and Gloucestershire). The occurrence is situated in the parish of Combe Hay, south of Bath where it is being worked underground from an adit. The thickness averages 6 ft. and the deposit underlies an area of approximately 270 acres or the equivalent of over 3 million tons of crude earth. Of this some 700,000 tons have been extracted. The annual output of the Fullers&apos; Earth Union Ltd. has risen from a little over 2,000 tons in 1940 to over 17,000 tons in 1948 from this district.

The presence of about 18 per cent. of calcium carbonate in the fullers&apos; earth of this area renders it uneconomic to activate by the treatment used at Redhill. The product is, therefore, mostly dried and treated for use in oil-well drilling and as a foundry sand compound.

Unimportant occurrences of fullers&apos; earth have been noted in the shaft of Priston Colliery near Chipping Sodbury and at Wick. Small attempts to work these in the past have been unsuccessful.

(c) Bedfordshire, Woburn. The deposit of fullers&apos; earth in an area adjacent to the villages of Woburn and Aspley Guise is well-known, and was worked until about the middle of the last century. The production was sold chiefly for fulling. The limits of this occurrence have been fairly accurately determined from records of well sections and from other sources, and it would appear that it was lenticular and thin and has probably been largely worked out. It is suggested, however, that a detailed survey might disclose areas where additional deposits may occur and which could be proved by shallow boreholes.

(d)Kent, Maidstone. An occurrence of fullers&apos; earth is known in the vicinity of Maidstone and was previously worked on a small scale N.E. of Vintners. Although little information is available as to the extent and quality of the mineral, it is not thought to be of economic importance.

(c) Sussex. General small occurrences have been recorded, but little information is available, and with the exception of that at Baynards, worked by Messrs. F. W. Berk &amp; Co. Ltd., whose rights cover 50 acres said to contain 500,000 tons, they are not thought to be of any economic importance.

(f) Isle of Man. The occurrence of a clay said to have the properties of fullers&apos; earth is recorded by the Geological Survey, the locality being Glen Wyllin.

History and Uses T!;;!f,,&quot;;:!&apos;f-144. Gypsum has been mined for plaster ^making smce-the latter: partof the 18th century,, although extraction was done for agricultural purposesmuch earlier and the mineral is known to have been worked in the formof alabaster since the 11th century for ecclesiastical ornament.145. The rapid growth of the industry in the present century is due tothe expansion of building works calling for special plasters and wall board,as well as for portland cement (in which the mineral is incorporated as aretarder). The following table shows the UK. consumption of raw gypsumin 1947:- .  &apos;-&apos;:y:&quot;.;,; &apos;.,/.:&apos;/&apos;..;:vv;;.../: TABLE XIII    , &apos;CONSUMPTION OF GYPSUM IN THE UNITED KINGDOM        ?Use	Tons	per cent.Plaster    ...     ...	351,512	41.4Portland Cement        ...	...     332,786	39.2Wall Board	....      132,549	15.other Uses	...       29.760	3.5 .(Export) I..      ...	...

The estimate of reserves furnished to us by the main concerns inthe gypsum mining industry may be taken as a near indication of the total quantity of unworked mineral so far established in this country. Provedreserves are stated to be 35 million ftons and further reserves indicated by boring, mining, and geological evidence, amount to at least 65 million tons. Broadly, one half of the total reserves is in the Midlands. area,and one quarter each in Cumberland and Westmorland, and Sussex.147. Nottinghamshire-All the mines now working in this county are found south of Nottingham between that city and Loughborough about10 miles away, the mining country stretching in a narrow east-west belt for15 miles from Kingston-on-the-Soar eastwards to Cropwell Bishop.The Geological Survey Memoir* defines two districts for the purposeof computing resources of the mineral:-(i) From the Yorkshire border to Cropwell Bishop(ii) Cropwell Bishop to the Leicestershire boundary.In the former no workable gypsum is said to be likely to exist north ofNewark and that south of the town there may be as much as some 4^ square miles of mineral of variable thickness in isolated &quot; cakes &quot; of up to 20 ft.across and 7-8 ft. thick as well as in three 1 ft. bands. In this area are situated the Hawton and Jericho quarries of B.P.B. Ltd. and the Kilvingtonproperty of Nottinghamshire Gypsum Products, Ltd. Southwards of CropwellBishop there is a proved area of 2 square miles with an average thicknessof 8 ft. of gypsum. It is reported that there are possibilities of gypsumoccurring on the southern margin of the Cropwell Bishop to Kingston area in a narrow east-west strip of country lying within a mile to the north of east Leake, but nothing positive is as yet known of this area.* Special Reports on the Mineral Resources of Great Britain: Vol. Ill, Gypsum andAnhydrite, 1938.   (H.M.S.O.  Price 2s. 6d.)
148. Sussex and East Kent. The gypsum of Sussex and East Kent occurs in the Purbeck Beds (top of the Jurassic) which come to the surface as three small inliers through the overlying Lower Gretaceous strata on the crest of the Wealden anticline about midway between Tunbridge Wells and Hastings. The Purbeck Beds consist of shales and thin limestones with, in the lower part, beds of gypsum.

149. The present workings are confined to the middle inlier situated a mile from Mountfield near Robertsbridge. Four seams are known. A section is as follows :-

ft.

TOP SEAM Gypsum grey, with white patches. 5

5 FT. SEAM Gypsum grey. 5

Shale. 4

MIDDLE SEAM Gypsum grey with some shale and limestone. 5 1/2

Shale. 6

BOTTOM SEAM Gysum, with shale and limestone. 14

The Top and Middle (sometimes known as Lower) seams have received most attention. The Top Seam was worked longwall but pillar-and-stall method has now been adopted.

150. Robertsbridge mine has recently been mechanised and re-organised for a rate of production of 400,000 tons per annum. The reserves of mineral have not been precisely estimated but are understood to be well in excess of 10 million tons.

151. Cumberland. An important source of supply at the present time is the Cocklakes Mine about 5 miles S.E. of Carlisle, where there are 2 beds of gypsum each about 8 ft. thick separated by 5-7 ft. of anhydrite and dipping northwards at a small angle from an old quarried outcrop. The annual rate of production, decreasing in the war years, is now back at the 1939 level. There are believed still to be large reserves, principally in the upper gypsum bed.

152. The one other active mine in Cumberland is in the Long Meg area near Lazonby where there are two gypsum beds separated by anhydrite at much the same geological horizon as that at Cocklakes, although the gypsum here has thinned down to about 5 ft. in each bed and the anhydrite thickened to 9-10 ft. No positive estimate of mineral reserves is available, the only indication being that in the Geological Survey Memoir* the possibility of the gypsum and anhydrite strata continuing to the north and south of the present mined area is mentioned, but with a predominance of anhydrite down dip.

153. In West Cumberland, gypsum was formely worked with anhydrite near St. Bees Head (Barrowmouth). The area likely to carry workable gypsum covers about 5 square miles and in the old Barrowmouth mine the thickness of the bed is said to have been 15 ft. and even 25 ft. in places. The anhydrite is present in considerable quantities, however, and the degree of inter-mixing is such as to reduce the importance of the area as a source of gypsum for plaster-making owing to the difficulty of separating the

*Special Reports: Vol. III, Gypsum and Anhydrite; 1938


minerals in mining. We are advised that B. &amp; A. Collieries Ltd. recently carried out some exploratory boring in this area. The National Coal Board is now engaged in boring at St. Bees Head with a view to proving the coalfield to the south of Whitehaven and while additional information on the presence of gypsum and anhydrite may be revealed, the Northern Division Authorities of the Board do not consider it would be possible to work the coal and gypsum conjointly.

154. Westmorland. In the Kirkby Thore area two mines are at present working: that at Stamp Hill has been much extended during the war years. There are 4 gypsum beds here aggregating about 12 ft. of mineral, the top bed being 6 ft. thick and the others each about 2 ft. The extent of these beds has not been closely defined, but it is known that on the margins of the working district anhydrite progressively replaces gypsum and sets a definite limit to the exploitable area in the direction of the northwards dip.

155. Staffordshire. The Fauld district, about 2 miles N.W. of Burton-on-Trent, has been famous for centuries past as a source of alabaster. The mineral is found in the horizon known as the Tutbury Gypsum Bed and is usually 8-10 ft. thick. In view of the extremely limited amount of geological information which exists in this district, it not possible to comment on the gypsum resources.

Minor Areas

156. (a) Derbyshire. The Tutbury gypsum horizon carries workable mineral here as in Staffordshire, although there is now pratically no production and the area is of little importance. The mineral in the form of alabaster has been quarried extensively from a 10 ft. thick bed in the Chellaston and Aston districts, a few miles S.W. of Derby. There appears to be no information as to the extent of the deposit which is near the surface and broken into pillars by infillings of glacial drift.

157 (b) Somerset. Recent boring and excavation at Hurcot, near Somerton, have shown the existence of some 6,000 tons of gypsum, and indicate that the deposit may extend considerably beyond the proved area. The mineral occurs in bands of varying thickness and is expected to amount to about 25 per cent. of the quarrying face when fully opened up. No marketable production has as yet been obtained, and there is an overburden which is large for quarrying but too thin for mining proper. The deposit is not well situated for economic distribution.

158. (c) Other Occurrences. - Gypsum has been worked in a small way in the Yate district of Gloucestershire, in Dorset and in Leicestershire (in the area adjoining the main Nottinghamshire field). The reserves of mineral in these areas are not believed to be important by present-day standards of production.

159. The presence of gypsum has also been proved in the Long Fryston area of the North Riding of Yorkshire, and in S. Cumberland and Furness.

Summary

160. We conclude that the resources of gypsum in the U.K., estimates of which exceed 100 million tons, are such as to ensure all foreseeable demands for many years.

Character of the Ore Bodies166. The ore is a true haematite, averaging from 42 per cent, to 62 per cent.Iron (Fe) with between 5 per cent, and 15 per cent, silica (Si02) and 0.005 to0.012%P. The low phosphorous content makes it specially suitable forhaematite pig for use hi foundries, and for. steel-making in acid; converters.167. Geologically the area is associated with faults in me CarboniferousLimestone. The ore solutions have followed the faults and replaced parts ofthe limestone forming the walls of the faults to a varying-and irregulardegree. The ore deposits are of three main types, namely, vein-like bodies,horizontal extensions from the veins known as &quot; flats &quot; and, in Furness, largebodies known as &apos;f sops &quot; occupying swallow holes in the Carboniferous Lime-stone. These last-named are how I worked out. ; Some of the larger flats,for instance those in the Egremont region and at Hodbarrow, and thePark Sop in Furness, have each yielded some .10, millions of tons of ore.Recent evidence obtained by the Geological Survey has enabled the conditions under which the ore deposits originated to be defined more precisely. Geher-ally speaking, their frequency and size is likely to decrease as the Carbbnifer-ous Limestone in which they occur attains greater depth beneath the cover of younger rocks westwards from the Lake District hills towards the IrishSea. For these and other reasons areas which may be worth iwhile prospectingcan be shown to be limited.*Reserves&apos;.;&apos;- iucpyC)168. It will be clear from the mode of occurrence that the calculation of reserves in irregular ore bodies of the type now being worked is most difficult.In most of the mines now working it would be safe to say that at least tenyears&apos; supply of proved ore is in sight at the present rate of output. further development and mining may well prove a much larger figure. Thus in onemine still in the development stage, prospects suggest that proved reserves of over one million tons at present in sight may be substantially added to asdevelopment proceeds. Taking the field as a whole, and bearing in mind the records of recent boreholes, we have come to the conclusion, after consultationwith the Geological Survey and the mining companies, that some of the minescan be assured of at least fifteen years&apos; life at the present rate of output, andthat the tonnage of proved reserves at the individual mines varies between1  and 3J million tons. In the opinion of the West Coast Hematite Iron OreProprietors&apos; Association some of the mines have twenty years&apos; life.169.

It is generally agreed by local experts and accepted by us that theprospects of finding any large body of ore in Furness. are exceedingly remote.Both in Cumberland and Furhess, however, there ^xist cbrtain small areasof ground not yet tested by boring where concealed CarboniferousLimestonemay occur. While such areas cannot yet be considered as potentially ore-bearing, it might be worth while, incurring a limited expenditure of money at some future date to obtain more precise geological information, althoughsuch ventures would have to be regarded as purely speculative. Meantime,however, it is most important that prospective areas are not ul-advisedlysterilised by surface development such as new towns, roads,-or factoriesuntil the prospects have been examined more closely .and, if &quot;necessary;&apos;explored by boring. &apos; &apos; - &apos;173. We have obtained evidence of several attempts which have beenmade in recent years to locate haematite ore bodies by geophysical means.:Generally, these attempts have been unsuccessful; although in certain instances,in the case of known ore bodies near the surface, some success has been achieved.

180. It will be seen that by modern standards lead-zinc production in England and Wales has been relatively small. Supposing each district could be revived to the extent that production reached a rate corresponding to that at the height of lead mining prosperity in the U.K., say 1850-1870, it would not satisfy more than about one quarter of present domestic requirements. Even in comparatively recent years, however, largely due to the success attending the relatively large-scale development of three mines (Mill Close, Halkyn and Greenside) domestic production of lead ore has made a significant contribution to requirements and fifteen years ago amounted to about 15 per cent. or around 40,000 tons per annum in terms of metal content. Halkyn Mine suspended production in 1941 and Mill Close in 1944. Thereafter, Greenside Mine with small contributions from a few other mines in different parts of the country, has supplied the bulk of home-produced lead concentrates. Annual production has steadily decreased since 1939; in 1941 it was 10,000 tons and is now (1948) about 3,000 tons, of which Greenside supplies over 2,500 tons.

181. The decline in the prosperity of the country&apos;s lead and zinc mining industry dates from about 1880 and has been ascribed by the industry to various factors the chief of which are (i) taxation, (ii) the instability of metal prices, (iii) the influence of competition from lead mining undertakings overseas. While these reasons may have had an important influence on the decline, it is usually accepted by responsible authorities today that the richer and more accessible deposits have been largely exhausted. Furthermore, present-day conditions are not usually sufficiently attractive to encourage mining enterprise to finance the search for new ore bodies, which, in general, would mean exploration at greater depth and with less chance of success than in the past.

Resources

182. Apart from a few relatively minor occurrences referred to below, it can be stated that there are no proved resources of lead and zinc ores of importance in any mineral district. A few attempts are at present being made, no doubt encouraged by the present high metal prices, to re-open small mines with the object of carrying out limited exploration and development. Some lead ore is being obtained as a by-product of fluorspar mining in West Durham and in Derbyshire. So far as the future is concerned, however, any real attempt to increase production of lead and zinc ores would have to be preceded by an extensive exploratory campaign with the object of discovering and developing large new ore deposits, if they exist. While there are geological and other reasons indicating that such a campaign would have a reasonable chance of success in specific cases, the work could not be regarded as other than highly speculative. The main evidence available at the moment which would be helpful in planning such a prospecting campaign and which at least draws attention to not unpromising geological factors, has been obtained by the Geological Survey during the course of recent surveys in the mineral fields, and by other leading authorities, on which evidence has been presented to the Committee.

Teesdale. ;A company has: recently been formed to operate Jhis mine;. ,Else-where in the district no proved reserves of lead ore; of ecpnoniic,importanceare known; although small tonnages of zinc ore,/are in place at NenisburyMine, near Alston (about 54,000 tons with $.15 percent, zinc) and,at Etters-gill Mine, near Middleton-in-Teesdale (25,000 tons with 10 per cent. zinc).Probable Reserves  .185. At Sipton Mine, East Allendale, which^was closed in 1943, a reserve of lead ore has been indicated on the continuation of Esps vein, but the exactquantity would have to be determined by further development. Similarly,at Rotherhope Mine, near Alston, recently closed, probable reserves exist,but an estimation of the exact quantities and grade is not possible.        ,Prospects .  A[:&apos;&apos;186. There still remain large areas in this district where the Great Lime-stone, which is the favourable horizon for ore deposition, is accessible but isas yet unexplored. Dr. Dunham, in the paper referred to, regards an area ofabout 1J sq. miles near Kilhope, between Nenthead and Allendale, as themost promising, since it is situated directly between the large mineralisedfields of Alston Moor and Allendale which have been so productive of lead and zinc concentrates in the past. Two further areas lie between Weardaleand Nenthead and between Rookhope and East Allendale, neither of- which,however, is as promising as that near Kilhope. All of these areas shouldbe treated as units for the purpose of any exploratory programme. Morethan one mineral owner is involved.DERBYSHIRE187. No reserves of lead or zinc ore of economic importance are known,and the history of this district, with one important exception (Mill Close),has shown that all the mines have been relatively small, and that the area was approaching exhaustion by 1860. The development of Mill Close between1920 and 1944 showed for the first time that mineralisation extended deeperthan was orginally believed. Similar geological conditions to those existingat Mill Close are known to exist in certain parts of Derbyshire and thus a potential unexplored area of ground exists at depth where new deposits of lead and zinc ores may well be discovered. Generally speaking, however,such exploration would be costly, and, as in the case of the Northern Pen-nines, attempts at exploration in future would have to be oh a large scale and backed by ample resources.FLINTSHIRE AND DENBIGHSHIRE188. No proved reserves are known in this area. So far as future prospects are concerned, however, it is generally agreed that the further developmentof Halkyn Mine holds promise. This mine was one of the three largest pro-ducing lead mines in this country, and operations were suspended in 1941owing to the exhaustion of most of the ore in the ground developed. Theexistence of other veins in this area is known, however, and there arereasonable prospects that the extension of workings of Halkyn Mine south-wards would reveal the existence of new ore bodies. We understand mat ex-ploration has recently been restarted by Halkyn District United Mines, Ltd.189. Although strictly speaking not in this district, mention might be madeof Pare Mine, Llanrwst, closed during the War, but which has been provedstill to contain a small tonnage of low-grade lead and zinc ore. There are some prospects of discovering further deposits in the ground immediatelyadjoining it. Trecastell Mine, also in this area, has recently been re-opened.
cardiganshire and montgomeryshire190- It has-been estimated that in two or threemines in mis area,reserves.of zhic ore have been proved from which about 30,000 tons of zinc (metal)could be recovered.

Similarly reserves of zinc ore are reputed to exist in Thbrnthwaite Mine, but here again no information is available. It is unlikely that either Of these mifles can be developed on a large scale.

NORTH YORKSHIRE POTASH

199. In 1938-39 an exploratory borehole for oil was sunk by the D&apos;Arcy Exploration Co. Ltd. at Aislaby, near Whitby. A detailed statement of the information revealed by the borehole was announced in a paper by Dr. G. M. Lees and Mr. A. H. Taitt (of the D&apos;Arcy Exploration Co.) read to the Geological Society of London on 6th December 1944, and published in the Quarterly Journal of that Society in February, 1946. It may be summarised as follows:-

(i) A salt bed was recorded at a depth of 3,655-3,680 ft. containing not more than 1 per cent. potassium chloride (KC1), with a thin band of 3.2 per cent KC1 at 3,800 ft.

(ii) A second salt bed from 3,920-4,193 ft. containing a thin bed of "sylvinite" with up to 34 per cent. KC1. Further records of KC1 were obtained immediately below this, but owing to incomplete core recovery, the exact thickness and quantity are unknown.

(iii) A third salt bed from 4,312-4,775 ft. containing a solid bed of polyhalite with 15.6 per cent. potash (K2O) about 45 ft, thick.

(iv) Natural gas, about 95 per cent methane, under a pressure of 1,650 lbs. per sq. in. was struck at 4,212 ft. A short test gave gas production at the rate of 2.5 million cu. ft. per day.

(v) Near the base of the borehole at a depth of 4,870 ft. water was encountered the analysis of which showed 11,370, 1,036, and 19,028 parts per hundred thousand sodium (Na), potassium (K) and chlorine (C1) respectively. This represents almost a saturated solution of brine, containing, in addition, some KC1 in solution.

Owing to the collapse of the borehole, particularly at the salt horizons, the existing borehole could not be used for any further exploration or for longer pumping tests on the supply of natural gas and brine available. 

200. Geological evidence from the borehole and the surrounding district suggests that salt beds of the type recorded are likely to occupy a considerable area extending mainly eastwards and not to be isolated or fortuitous occurrences. Such deposits were produced by the evaporation in Permian times of a sea, called the Zechstein Sea, long known to geologists as having once extended across North Germany to East Britain. Important deposits of similar salts which accumulated in the same sea have been worked in Germany on a large scale for many years. It will be noted that the existence of two different potash salts has been recorded; "sylvinite", containing KC1, and polyhalite containing potassium sulphate; of the two the former is by far the more important as a raw material for manufacturing fertilisers. Unfortunately, for technical reasons and because the boring was for oil, the recovery of the core from the borehole was incomplete in the salt horizons where KC1 was recorded.

201. The attention of Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. was drawn by the D&apos;Arcy Company to the salt deposits, which were not then known to contain potash salts, and they were invited to examine the borehole cores. The salts were found to consist chiefly of common salt (sodium chloride), anhydrite (calcium sulphate), "sylvinite" (mixed potassium and sodium chloride). Polyhalite (a hydrous sulphate of calcium, magnesium and potassium) was afterwards recognised to be present by Professor W. G. Fearnsides and Professor C. E. Tilley.


202. No action was taken in regard to further exploration until 1948. Prior to that time, the Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd., who were already working anhydrite and salt further north in the Teeside area, did not consider the information then available justified further exploration from the commercial standpoint. However, in 1943 they drew the attention of the Ministry of Supply to the occurrence in view of a possible decision by that Ministry to undertake exploration as a wartime emergency measure. This information was brought to the attention of the Non-Ferrous Metallic Ores Committee (Chairman:- Sir William Larke, K.B.E) which reported that the discovery was potentially important and recommended that if home-produced potash was required, immediate steps should be taken to ascertain the extent and thickness of the deposits by means of further exploratory boreholes. This report also recommended that the mineral rights covering the potash occurrences should be nationalised.

203. It was eventually decided not to proceed at that time, since it appeared that even should further boring give favourable results, the opening up of a mine at that depth to develop the deposits would be a long-term undertaking and costly in money and manpower. Other ways of working the occurrences, i.e. by pumping the brine at the base of the borehole, were apparently not considered.

204. In September, 1946, immediately after our appointment, we thought the facts should be re-examined without delay in view of the potential importance of the discovery. I.C.I. kindly supplied us with further reports and their attention was naturally centred on the possible value of the substantial deposit of polyhalite (para. 199, iii). Their opinion at that time was that, while more information about the deposits was essential, and because further boreholes would be costly, we should arrange some preliminary re-search work on the value of polyhalite as a fertiliser and investigate the cost and practicability of mining it at about 4,500 ft. The existence of the methane gas under pressure immediately above the polyhalite would have added to the mining difficulties. From the commercial point of view Imperial Chemical Industries doubted whether, on the facts available, the project could compete with imported potash. We ascertained that, although research in America suggested that this mineral had some value as a fertiliser when untreated, it could not yet be stated that it would be worth winning from this depth, or that if it needed further chemical treatment the final product would not be too costly.

205. In December 1947, after further discussion with Dr. G. M. Lees, Professor S. E. Hollingworth and the Geological Survey at a special meeting, we decided that, subject to the results of further boring and pumping tests, a production of potash might be achieved more quickly and cheaply by pumping the brine solution which was proved at the base of the D&apos;Arcy borehole (p. 44, v). Furthermore, we realised that the recovery of potash by this means would involve also the separation of about ten times the quantity of common salt, and that the economics of the project might be favourably influenced if the salt could also be used. There was also the possibility of natural gas, if it were found to exist in quantity, being utilised on connection with the pumping as a source of fuel in the extraction process, or being developed concurrently for other purposes.

206. Dr. A. Fleck, a Director of I.C.I., later attended this meeting and his attention was drawn to the opinion we had reached. He admitted that up to that time I.C.I. had not thought that the extraction of potash from the deposits was a proposition which would justify commercial development


by them. After this meeting, however, LCI. examined the brine-pumpingscheme and subsequently wrote to us (February, 1948) that, they thought ,the project held sufficient promise to justify further exploratory boring;;this they; were prepared to undertake at their own expense. .207. In March, 1948, we communicated Our provisional ^conclusions to meMinister j emphasising that on the face of it, the brine-pumping scheme was more attractive than mining polyhalite. We stated that the prospect ofproving thicker beds of &quot; sylvinite&quot; must not be overlooked as this Waspotentially much more important.208. LCI. commenced one exploratory borehole later in 1948 with themain objective of investigating the potentialities Of the potassium-bearingbrine. By February, 1949, when this account was written, the borehole hadbeen carried to a depth of 5,500 ft. but it had not adequately penetratedthe limestone strata in which the brine had been found in the earlierborehole, and technical limitation of the only equipment at present availableprevents the borehole being carried to a greater depth. No further informa-tion about the prospects of the brine-pumping scheme, therefore, has yetbeen obtained.    - &apos;. -       ......209. This latest borehole, hOWever, has yielded Other information ofgreat value. Precautions were taken to obtain cores of the strata in whichthe potash salts were recorded in the original borehole, and we understandthat indications of a substantial thickness of potassium minerals were obtainedwhich are promising enough to justify further exploratory work. Further-more, it would appear that interest may again turn to the possibility ofrecovering potassium chloride either by mining or by a solution methodrather than by pumping the deeper seated potassium-bearing brine.210. Though the magnitude in a geological sense and the economic im-portance of this latest discovery have yet to be proved, and it may be aslong as two years before sufficient additional exploration has been carriedout, it looks as if the prospect is emerging of a most important additionto the country&apos;s natural reserves. As this is the first indication of the- occurrence of a substantial quantity Of a mineral highly valuable to agriculture the whole of our domestic requirements of which are at present imported,great significance must be attached to this information.211. If the most sanguine hopes of this project are realised and it isfound that sufficient potash can be produced economically to make a sub-stantial contribution to our domestic requirements or even to make the U.K.self-supporting in this respect, then the question of whether one firmcould or should embark on an undertaking of such national importanceought to be examined. Furthermore, the development of such a projectwhether or not it be undertaken by more than one firm, should be properlyplanned and related ;to information about the extent and importance ofthe mineral occurrence as a Whole.  *212. In the meantime, now that more specific information is available about the extent of potash deposits it is urgently necessary that furtherboreholes should be sunk in order that the extent and economic value of the occurrence can be determined and the most suitable method of development in the national interest be ascertained. Until the proposed Mineral Develop-ment Commission (see Chapter XI) is set up the ^national interest in a project of this importance should be secured by some form of joint company with a controlling state interest, but in which other firms who might be interested in potash production in this country should be given the opppr-tunity of participating under suitable arrangements.  \ ...
213. We also recommend that, vunless pur proposals regarding the estab-lishment of a Mineral Development Commission and the nationalisation of mineral rights are to be hiiplemeh^^witbih^a^^short time, the mineral rights in specified- potashrbearing minerals shall be nationalised separately,and without delay, in the same manner in which petroleum mineral rightswere nationalised under the Petroleum (Production) Act, 1934.SALT,214. The principal salt deposits worked at the present time in GreatBritain are in Cheshire, Lancashire, South Durham, Staffordshire andWorcestershire. Cheshire production contributes over 80 per cent, of thetotal. A considerable part of the industry, operated by Imperial chemical industries Ltd., is concerned with the production of brine as&quot; a basic rawmaterial for the manufacture of important heavy chemicals as well as forthe manufacture of domestic salt. The remainder of the industry is mainly concerned with the production of brine from which salt is extracted for usein the food industries and for domestic purposes. The tonnage of rocksalt produced is small; it is mined at one locality only and is sold mainlyas catde-lick. 1Production215. The annual output of salt in this country has for many years past been of the order of 3 million tons in brine, of which about 800,000 tons isextracted as solid salt, together with some 20,000 tons of mined rock salt,the U.K. normally ranking with Germany and Russia as the major worldproducers of salt after the U.S.A.216. In the period of the last War output of brine salt expanded and reached a maximum of 3.6 million tons in 1942. On the other hand theoutput of rock salt which had been as.high as 215,000 tons in 1913, hadby 1931 fallen to the order of 20,000 tons, and remained at that leveluntil 1947 when it was almost exactly.doubled. &quot;TABLE XVII \PRODUCTION OF SALT IN GREAT BRITAIN(tons)*BrineRockSaltBrineRockSalt*BrineRockSalt19131919192019211922192319241925192619272,033,1851,696,6531,931,0071,270,4581,736,0811,837,9681,992,3081,888,9731,686,7531,953,89014,57390,938108,08335,71236,54848,91453,45444,61740,69029,59619281929193019311932193319341935193619371,914,9691,938,0112,042,5411,876,0112,196,632.2,342,5792,499,0252,680,5532,800,2973,052,51831,34936,15925,02321,55319,56721,596,20,84819,53917,29118,37119381939194019411942194319441945194619472,610,0483,180,7153,351,8303,369,4073,570,5893,353,6843,355,1043,217,5523,333,0393,099,30219,65823,32326,02222,92626,96821,17417,49016,79220,49039,997* Salt content of brine.47

The chief producing salt fields of Great Britain are:- too(a) Cheshire (with extensions into Shropshire).  This is by far the mostimportant. .,\j(b) Lancashire.(c) South Durham N. Yorkshire (The Teeside area).These are dealt with in this., order, below, followed by shorter descriptions of sfevefal occurrences Which are. known, and from some of which smallerquantities of salt are obtained. /CHESHIRE-SHROPSHIRE &apos;;&apos;,&apos;/ tlUmiem iMtfinfa218. The major salt field of Great Britain is found in these two counties and occupies a broad syhcline stretching some : 50 miles; southward fromWilmslow in Cheshire to Werh in Shropshire. It contains two, salt beds,the Top and Bottom Beds, or &quot;Rocks&quot;^separated by the Middle Mari.The salt beds reach their greatest development near^ Nortbwich where a. thick-ness in each of at least 90 ft. has been recorded. Brine is drawn from thewhole salt formation through bore-holes.219. The total area underlain by salt has not been defined, but it isknown to amount to many square miles. Quite recently extensions havebeen proved in the neighbourhood of Mobberley by test bore-holes sunk inconnection with the New Towns Act.1    &apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;220. At the Meadow Bank Mine of LCI. Ltd., near Winsford, rock saltis worked at a depth of 450 ft. from the lowest 15 ft. of the Bottom Bedwhich contains less marl iand for this reason is the Only part mined. Thisis the only mine now operating in the U.K.       j 1;; lancashire -   &apos;&apos;221. Salt deposits occur at Preesall, near, Fleetwood, and in WalneyIsland, near Barrow-in-Furness, where they have been proved by boring.&apos;,222. At Preesall, the salt formation occurs as a lens about 1,500 yards;across and 300 ft. thick at its maximum. It has been worked underground,but is. now subject to extraction solely by brine-pumping.: Ah attempt towork the Walney Island salt was made many years; ago (circa!1895) but wasunsuccessful.....The salt in this areaprobablyoccurs hi two lenses, one ofwhich has been recorded as up to-237 ft. thick; thesalt is usually mixedwith marl.  The top of the deposit is at a depth of around 500 ft.
SOUTH DURHAM-NORTH YORKSHIRE

223. In the Tees estuary, an area of some 20 square miles around Billingham and Middlesbrough is underlain by salt deposits overlying anhydrite. The latter mineral is worked underground by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., but the salt is obtained to the east of the anhydrite mine by brine-pumping from a bed having an average thickness of about 100 ft.

224. Important discoveries of salt beds at depths of over 3,500 ft. have been made in the North Riding of Yorkshire as a result of an oil-prospecting bore-hole, which also proved potash salts at various depths. A nearby bore-hole made recently expressly in search of potash-bearing brine and solid potash salts is understood to have confirmed the earlier findings of common salt and potash minerals (para. 209).

Salt is also known to occur in the Market Weighton and Barlow districts.

Minor Areas

STAFFORDSHIRE

225. The salt industry is here located at Stafford Common, on the northern outskirt of Stafford, where brine is pumped from bore-holes. The Salt strata are thin and marly in character, being a southward marginal continuation of the main Cheshire beds from which they have been separated as the result of folding.

WORCESTERSHIRE

226. Droitwich has long been a centre of salt production and rock salt was mined at Stoke Prior in the latter part of the 18th and early 19th centuries. The pumping of brine has been discontinued at the Spa itself for amenity reasons and concentrated at Stoke Prior.

OTHER AREAS

227. Salt is being produced in a small way in the Isle of Man and in Somerset.

Summary

228. The reserves of salt present in the U.K. is a matter of considerable speculation, but they have been estimated by the late Dr. R. L. Sherlock of the Geological Survey as at least 15,000 million tons. It will be obvious that reserves must be very large because about 1 ft. of salt over a square mile is equivalent to over one million tons, and the Cheshire salt-bearing ground is known to cover more than 20 square miles with two of the main beds having a thickness in places of at least 90 ft. Similar arguments suggest that in N. Lancashire and Durham ample reserves still exist: furthermore, the discovery of potash-bearing salt beds and brines in N.E. Yorkshire points to a new and large supply of salt becoming availabe should it be feasible to develop this source of potash as a major contributor to the national needs.

229. It is reasonable, therefore, to draw the conclusion that in the three main producing areas alone ample workable reserves exist for all reasonable and foreseeable needs, and that, in addition, large reserves of salt are present in the other areas indicated.

TIN AND TUNGSTEN ORES

230. The resources of the tin mineral, cassiterite, and the tungsten minerals, wolfram and scheelite, lie almost entirely in Cornwall and the adjacent parts of Devonshire, the ores occurring in veins ("lodes") connected, with the


s3intrusion of the several granite masses in those Counties. A small isolatedoccurrence of both the tungsten ores occurs at Carrock Fell, Cumberland,which has been: worked&apos; in a small way and was re-examined by the Ministryof Supply during the last War. &apos;231. Up to the middle of the Nineteenth Century many of: the tin-bearinglodes of Cornwall were also worked for copper ore,.especially in their upperparts, and with contributions from certain other^^jpajurrenc^s; (in,-. Anglesey,Cheshire and the Lake District).contributed, the ^^^^^u^y^3^^0^ff/.of,copper. Since then copper mining in the south-west of England, hascpased and the chief metalliferous minerals worked have been tin, and/wolfram ores; there is little prospect of coppermining being revived &quot;(paras.-113 to 116). &quot; ...,&quot;&quot;&apos;;232. The history of tin mining in Cornwall is generally well-known,: andwe do not propose to trace it in any detail. The area has been worked formany hundreds of years. Mining activity reached its zenith in the last century, when an annual production of around 10,000 tons (tin metal in ore)was attained from about 1860-1870. At that time this figure represented40 per cent, of the total world output. a Since then the decline in production on average has been continuous, the overriding reason being the gradualexhaustion of the known and more accessible deposits. In. comparison withalluvial workings in other parts of the world the Cornish tin mines havegradually become high cost producers.TABLE XIXTIN ORE PRODUCTION DEVON AND CORNWALL(tons in terms of metal content)1938    .	..   1,999	1943     .	..   1,3591939    .	...   1,738	1944     .	..   1,3891940	..   1,619	1945	9931941	..   1,508	1946	8491942	...   1,364	1947	802(For production figures prior to 1938 see page 11)233. The number of tin mines operating in Cornwall and Devon reached a maximum of 230 in 1874. At the beginning of the twentieth century thenumber had been reduced to 100, and in 1938 it was 4; only two mines ofimportance are in operation to-day. Present production of tin from Cornwallis of the order of 800 tons (metal in ore) per annum, equivalent to between and 3 per cent, of current domestic consumption. The annual value of theoutput at present-day prices is approximately  450,000.234. Wolfram is the main tungsten ore found in this country.; At present only one small wolfram mine is working (in Cornwall) although a littlewolfram is obtained from time to time as a by-product in the tin mines.With one or two exceptions it has only been in times of war that mines havebeen opened for wolfram primarily. The domestic deposits of this mineralare generally relatively small and not able to support anything more thansmall mines for any length of time. The large but low-grade deposit of wolfram (also containing some tin) at Hemerdon, near Plymouth (para. 250)may be an important exception, particularly in view of the existence of thelarge and modern treatment plant erected by the Ministry of Supply duringthe 1939-45 War, and because the deposit can be worked opencast on alarge scale. . -:; -; ---- -    ------        .:r;i !.   -

The two important tin mines now. in operation are Geevor Mine,St. Just, near Penzance (Geevor Tin Mines, Ltd.) and South Crofty Mine,Carh Brea, near. Camborne (South Crofty Ltd.). They employ togetherbetween 600 and 700 men. The two mines were examined by us in January,1947, and our preliminary views formed at that time and now confirmed were communicated to you in July, 1947, and are now largely incorporated inthis Report.   &amp; vv;;:v. iW^Q V/&apos;i    \U:,wiv:&amp; 2&apos;;j,1 ftq;.isri:lD\)mixp236. South Crofty mine is situated within the long-famous Cornish tin-producing district of Camborne-Redruth which has supplied most of theCornish production. This area is famous also as a training ground for miners and. technicians many of. whom have carried Cornish mining traditions toall the chief metalliferous mining fields of the world.&apos; In our examination ofthis area we had the advantage of access to a valuable technical report of aCommittee under the Chairmanship pf Mr. Robert Annan appointed by theMinister of Fuel and Power to enquire into the resources of this area inJune, 1945.237. Both of the; operating mines suffer from a shortage of undergroundlabour, and this restricts output; and-.increases costs per ton. Even so, at thecurrent price of tin metal ( 569 per ton) Geevor mine is operating profitably,although if operations are to continue^there for any length of timeUthe minewill be faced with considerable capital expenditure in connection with the exploration and development of new ground into which the present workingscould be extended with a reasonable prospect of success. South Crofty mineis at present continuing.to operate under a Ministry of Supply Wartime contractwhereby output is purchased at cost. Apart from the adverse effects on costs per ton of shortage of labour^ working costs at South Crofty areabnormally high due to inadequate pumping facilities. The amount ofwater to be pumped has been much increased due to&apos; the closure of anadjoining mine (East Pool) in 1945, the workings of which, with thoseof other shallower old mines, are connected with those of South Crofty.Resources -0Atiodmi-i\ ad; 238. In undeveloped areas adjacent to the two operating mines there is available geological information favourable for the occurrence of lode forma-tions, which with other evidence suggests that considerable tonnages of ore ofeconomic grade may still be found. Although most of the larger and betterknown lodes in the highly mineralised. Cam Brea area have been workedextensively, geological and other evidence, although by no means conclusive,suggests that further development from the existing workings of South Croftyand from those of. East Pool, would be likely to prove substantial quantitiesof tinore pi economic, grade. abasedvon present standards. Unfortunately,actual underground development at South Crofty is so little ahead of existingworkings that not more than one or two years&apos; supply of ore on the present
scale of operations can be said to be proved. At the moment, however, development prospects are reasonably good. There was little proved ore in East Pool when it closed, but here again there are unexplored areas of promise.

239. Ore reserves at Geevor mine amount to at least three years&apos; supply. Present workings, moreover, are adjacent to an area of ground known to be geologically favourable for the discovery of new resources, but it would have to be opened up and explored before any estimate of reserves could be made.

240. Owing to the lag in development and exploration the future of the tin mining industry as a whole, particularly in the Carn Brea district can only be regarded as uncertain beyond two or three years. The proving of probable new deposits of commercial size and grade in the neighbourhood of the existing mines will necessitate greatly increased expenditure on development or new exploration before the industry can count safely on operations continuing for a longer period.

241. The possibility of new mines of long-term economic importance being opened in other parts of the Cornwall and Devon mining district must be considered in relation to the fact that the area has been worked for a long time and the more accessible ore deposits are probably exhausted. This naturally increases the normal element of speculation attached to lode mining of the Cornish type, and especially to new projects. The increasing depths of working which would probably be necessary would enhance the difficulties and would increase costs, due to many factors of which mine drainage is usually the most important. Outside the immediate areas of the two operating mines there is little precise information of any substantial proved reserves, either of tin or of wolfram (with the possible exception of Hemerdon, para. 250). It has been submitted to us that there are likely to be found tin and wolfram resources of national importance in various parts of Cornwall and Devon, and many instances have been mentioned to us of mines which have closed for reasons other than exhaustion of the ore body being worked. It is certainly true that in Cornwall many cases exist where a multiplicity of mineral ownerships have led to many small mines being opened up where fewer but larger mines would have had a better chance of survival. In certain cases there is supporting geological evidence justifying a case for further exploration, but little or no other evidence. The financial risk, therefore, would be considerable and projects of this kind, which might be successful only if carried out on a relatively large scale, cannot be attractive to private enterprise as offering reasonable commercial possibilities until more knowledge of the existence of new deposits has been obtained.

242. It has been further suggested to us that the production of tin in Cornwall can be greatly increased. While there is always the chance that this might be realised, our examination has not brought to light any confirmatory evidence, and there are no proved, or even probable reserves, to support such suggestions. It would be most unwise to assume that any particular increase in output could be achieved beyond that possible from existing mines until such time as a thorough exploratory campaign has established the existence and workability of resources of ore in sufficient quantities to support new mines for a reasonable length of time.

243. It is important to remember in connection with proposals to revive tin mining in Cornwall that at present there is an acute shortage of underground labour. There has undoubtedly grown up over recent years a prejudice in Cornwall against underground work. This is no doubt due in part to the uncertain future of the industry. But equally important factors


appear to be the deterrent of silicosis to recruitment of new labour and, it has been stated to us, the unfavourable comparison of rates of pay in Cornwall with those for instance, in coal mining.

244. The approach to the question of shortage of underground labour, and indeed to the whole future of Cornish mining should be, in our view, through scientific examination of the evidence available in specific localities with a view to carrying out properly conducted schemes of exploration to ascertain whether ore reserves of long-term importance occur. Such schemes would have to deal comprehensively with relatively large areas, and be prepared to carry exploration to considerable depth. If favourable results were obtained, there would be a better case for making a real attempt to attract new manpower, particularly if increasing attention were paid to anti-silicosis measures and to raising the standard of working conditions. In other words, once there was a prospect of a flourishing industry being re-established confidence would be restored, and there would then be much better prospect of the labour situation righting itself.

Research

245. It is important that much more attention should be paid to research, primarily with the object of improving present mineral dressing practice in this industry. Modernisation of existing treatment plants, where necessary, is mainly a long-term economic question related essentially to the ore-reserve position. On the other hand substantial economies could be effected if losses of tin ore in the mills, now amounting, we believe, to something between 25 per cent. and 35 per cent. could be reduced. Although the position in this respect is probably no worse than in tin ore extraction plants elsewhere in the world, the benefit of any improvement of recovery to the Cornish tin-mining industry should be emphasised since it might be the means of bringing into the realms of profitability certain known and extensive low-grade Cornish deposits not at present economic to work.

The Special Position of Tin Mining in the Carn Brea District

246. We have referred above to difficulties at present facing South Crofty mine, which is the sole remaining operating mine in what is probably one of the most intensely mineralised tin lode districts in the world. It is essential in our opinion for this mine to be kept in operation at least until such time as certain areas of unexplored ground to which its present workings give access have been thoroughly investigated. Otherwise the closure of the mine, and the consequent flooding of its extensive workings and those in the vicinity would probably mean that the cost of exploration later would be prohibitive, if ever it became necessary for strategic or other reasons to find out whether any further tin resources existed. It must not be forgotten that as the alluvial supplies of tin in the world (for instance, those of Malaya and Nigeria) now being rapidly drawn upon, became exhausted, it may be necessary once again to re-examine those areas carrying tin lodes, to see whether further resources can be found. From this point of view the Carn Brea district must continue to be regarded as of potential value to the Nation, and it would be unwise to neglect to take any reasonable measures now when the facilities are available. The cheapest and technically the most efficient way of carrying out an exploratory programme in the favourable areas adjacent to South Crofty mine would be to run it in conjunction with normally conducted mining operations.

247. If South Crofty mine is to be kept open, it is urgently necessary for new pumps to be provided to avoid the risk of total closure of the mine through breakdown of the existing, out-of-date, Cornish pumps. Moreover,


the management of the mine believe that new centrifugal pumps wouldresult in an annual saving of at least  20,000; they state that the latter would need only four men for:their operation as1 compared:with&apos;thev42!aipresent required,, and would result in a substantial saving of fuel. Thecost of new centrifugal: pumps is -estimated by the management at between 70,000 and  80,000, a suih whichi they state, the company^ is hot in a positionto raise. VY&apos;&apos;J-7&quot;    &apos; ,.-.&quot;V,-.&apos;..248. The risk of South Crofty mine closing must be removed until moredevelopment exploration in its immediate vicinity has been carried out.This must be considered as a matter Of urgency and apart from our other general recommendations in this Report, since if the latter are accepted, the interim period until they are implemented&apos;should not be lost. We make-aspecial reconimendation, therefore, designed to ensure that the chance ofexploring for possible reserves;of tin ore in the Cam Brea area is not lost,or made too hazardous or uneconomic..249. We recommend that:  The Minister of Supply, being at present responsible for tin supplies,should replace his existing contract with South Crofty, Ltd., by a new5 contract which would:  *. -r;.      &apos; m^-y-^mn(a) provide for the purchase of the output of tin concentrates fromthe mine at a guaranteed minimum price for a period of hot iessthan three and not more than five years.  .     *. &apos;(b) enable special provision to be made.for new centrifugal pumps, ifnecessary by a loan from public funds or by. a hire-purchasej. agreement.    r.\.-. io&apos;)U^od as: .bbov? -iiti ni\i: (c) empower the Minister to appoint one or mbre representatives onthe Board of South Crofty Ltd. and enable-him to prescribe theannual expenditure on underground development and maximumannual payment of dividends by the Company, so long as any loan to the Company from public funds is outstanding. &apos;v&apos;Hemerdon  . ^ ^250. An attempt to work the low-grade wOlfram-tin deposit at Hemerdonabout ten miles N.E. of Plymouth, was made under Government auspicesduring the 1914-18 War, but the project was uneconomic and operations were suspended soon after hostilities ceased.251. In 1939, a private Company (Hemerdon Wolfram Ltd.) erected asmall plant which commenced operations in 1941. The lease of the property was then assigned to the Ministry of Supply and the assets of this company were taken over by agreement in 1942. From January of that year to september, 1943, the plant was operated by Non-Ferrous Minerals Develop-ment Ltd. on behalf of the Ministry of Supply pending the erection of a much larger plant as an emergency war measure.252. Sampling and testing of the ore body by the Ministry of Supplyconfirmed previous testing and established the existence of at least 4,000,000tons of ore of a probable grade of 3.19 lbs. and 0.82 lbs. of equivalent 65 percent, wolfram and tin concentrates respectively per ton of ore, of which2.78 lbs. and 0.7 lbs. respectively were estimated to be recoverable. the tests, which had not been carried to a greater depth than 60 ft. indicated nodeterioration of values, and on these and other geological considerations thereis reason to suppose the existence at depth of a considerably greatertonnage of ore than that already proved. The output of the small plant from january 1942 to September 1943,&apos; from about 89,000 tons of ore&apos; milled
was equivalent to a recovery of 2.45 lbs. of 65 per Cent, wolfram concentrateand 0.45 lbs. of 65 per cent, tin concentrates, showing a reasonable comparisonwith sampling Results.       ,j     &quot; :HV&apos;&apos; -&apos;:     &apos; - &apos; &quot; &apos;-253. The small mill was partly dismantled to make way for the new, mill,capacity up to 3,000 tons per 24 hours, which came into operation inOctober, 1943. It continued until June 1944, when it was necessary to close owing to a favourable change in the wolfram supply position. In thisperiod 201,580 tons of ore were quarried and treated, yielding approximately181 tons of mixed wolfram and thTconcentrates in the proportions 42.61 percent. W03 and 11.86 per cent. Sn. The recovery in this case was only 48 percent, of that expected from the sampling results, it is believed mainly onaccount Of technical adjustments necessary to sections of the new mili andnot because of any known deterioration &quot;in the grade of orequarried.: the adjustments might cost upwards of  25,000, but no precise estimate hasbeen made.254. During the six months January 1944 to June 1944, the plant operatedat an average rate,of,.82-6 tons per hour capacity equivalent to a rate ofapproximately 2,000 tons per 24 hours. The Mill actually ran, however,for only .71 per cent, of the total possible time available due to mechanicaltroubles and this reduced the overall milling rate for the period. The projectemployed about 200 workers, of whom 40 were women.255. The total cost of the plant including the assignment of the lease of theproperty was approximately  368,000.256. The Ministry of Supply have kindly made available to us all thereports and data relating to the operation of the plant during the 1939-45War, Some of us also had the opportunity of inspecting the plant which isat present on a care and maintenance basis.257. For various reasons, some of which are mentioned below, the costof producing wolfram from Hemerdon during the War was considerably higher than had been estimated. The average cost of wolfram, omitting the trial weeks at the beginning when the plant was &quot;running in&quot; was approxi-mately of the order of 190s. per unit. This is allowing for a credit in respectof the tin produced as a by-product.258. The question of the disposal of the Hemerdon plant or its continuedretention on a cafe and maintenance basis is one which, in our view, mustbe considered in relation to the potential economic and strategic importanceto the country of the mineral deposit. Our provisional opinion (whichshould be confirmed or otherwise by a detailed examination) is that with suitable modifications the existing plant is admirably fitted and equipped for long-term operation. It is the most modern plant of its kind in thecountry, and has a capacity about twelve times that of any other tin orwolfram plant in Devon and Cornwall. The Hemerdon project, though sofar not proved to be economic, represents the first attempt in this countryto work a low-grade ore-body on a large scale and on modern lines.259. It would seem to us, therefore, that Hemerdon presents a strong arguement for the outlay of capital with the object of proving the extensionin depth and value of the mineral deposit. Without this essential informationit is useless to consider the possible economic importance of the plant when an ore supply of, at the most, only 4-5 years&apos; duration is at present proved.We have considered various schemes of exploration drawn up by theHemerdon Management, and while the final method selected could only be arrived at after closer study, it is probable that a series of exploratory
 bafts and galleries would; J?e most suitable.

Reserves

267. The reserves of mineral at the South Moor Collieries are stated to be of the order of 150, 000 tons and something slightly less than that amount at Settlingstones. Reserves at the latter are not wholly proved but further exploration might reveal larger tonnages. On the information at present available, however, we estimate that reserves are known probably sufficient to last from ten to twenty years at the present rate of production at both mines.

CHAPTER IV

MINERAL RESOURCES (SCOTLAND)

268. The information contained in this Chapter is based on a report by our Scottish Sub-Committee (see page 8) which was appointed in January, 1947, and whose conclusions we have accepted.

269. The Sub-Committee held ten meetings in Edinburgh, including a joint meeting with the Scottish Council (Development and Industry). In addition, they visited the following mines or mineral-beating districts:-

Leadhills and Wanlockhead (lead and zinc),

Tyndrum (lead),

Killin (Corrycharmaig) (serpentine, chromite, talc and magnesite),

Gasswater (barytes),

Muirshiels (barytes),

Shetland islands (talc, chromite, serpentine).

270. Much of the technical information has been furnished by the Scottish Office of the Geological Survey and Museum and our thanks are due to Mr. T. H. Whitehead, Assistant Director (Scotland), and to his staff for the care which they have taken in the compilation and geological assessment of the data available, and for the work which they have put into the geological reports on mineral resources supplied to us.

271. The procedure was generally to review all the geological evidence and to supplement it by an examination of records of mining operations, other technical reports, and where desirable, by visits to the areas concerned. The Sub-Committee were fortunate in many cases to have had access to special reports on lead and zinc resources, haematite and magnetite iron ores, mica, felspar, diatomite, etc., made on behalf of the Ministry of Supply during the War, many of them by Mr. Gordon S. Duncan, A.R.S.M., M.I.M.M.

272. Most proposals to explore or develop Scottish minerals, particularly in the Highlands and Islands, will have to be considered in relation to probems of labour, supply and transport. While, any proposal must not be rejected for these reasons alone until the potential value of the mineral deposit has been assessed, it is clearly essential to consider these two factors and their economic implications at an early stage, particularly in relation to other planning and development schemes.


273. Apart from those few places where mines are still ih operation, andin the Leadhills-Wanlockhead area, mining labour is practically non-existentin Scotland outside the coalfields. It is apparent, therefore, that any schemes to develop new mineral resources underground would have to take thisinto account, and to plan sufficiently far ahead if an attempt were to be successful; This is one reason in our view why adequate exploration isnecessary first, in order to prove the existence of economic minerals onwhich long-term projects can be based, before labour is encouraged to leaveother employment and to be trained for mining. On the other hand, thereare areas, particularly in the Highlands, where local unskilled labour is available in small numbers and this might influence any mineral development schemes, or at least decisions to start exploration requiring relatively fewmen.274. The chief mdc minerals found in Scotland and which have beenconsidered are:  Metalliferous Non-metalliferousOres of lead Baryteszinc Diatomitecopper Mica,,      nickel Talccobalt Magnesite ,antimony Chromite, serpentine and olivine,, manganese rock,, chromium FelsparBeryl Glass sandMagnetite iron ore FluorsparHaematite iron ore Graphite.275. The Sub-Committee confined their attention mainly to those mineralswhich are now being worked and to those that seem likely to occur insufficient quantity to make their economic development in future a possi-bility. Some of these are barytes, ores of lead and zinc, haematite andmagnetite iron ore, diatomite, talc, serpentine and olivine rock, felspar, mica,and glass sand. Some of the others, for instance, ores of copper, nickel,and manganese and graphite, have been worked in small quantities here andthere in the past, but with one or two exceptions mentioned below thepossibility of discovering further resources of value is remote.276. By far the most important minerals in the past have been the oresof lead and zinc (chief area Wanlockhead and Leadhills) and barytes (isle of Arran and Gasswater). Today no lead or zinc ore is being produced,but barytes is still important (the Arran source is believed to be exhausted,but Gasswater and another mine recently re-opened, Muirshiels, are pro-ducing on an expanding scale). Other minerals being worked today aretalc (Banffshire), serpentine and talc (Shetland) glass sand (Loch Aline).Arrangements have also been completed recently to develop the diatomitedeposit in the Isle of Skye (para. 289).277. A synopsis is given below of the present position about resources,the supporting data for which is, for the most part, the reports receivedfrom the Geological Survey (Scotland). When there is sufficient information,the Sub-Committee have endeavoured to distinguish between mineral occur-rences &quot;where, in their opinion, further exploration would be worthwhile,and others of doubtful value which it would seem on present evidence neednot be further considered.  The arrangement is alphabetical.
BARYTES278. &quot;Barytes has been found at several localities in, different parts OfScotland but at the present time it is only being worked at Gasswater Mine,Cronberry, Ayrshire, and Muirshiels Mine, Lbchwinnoch, Renfrewshire. Pre-viously an important producer was Glen Sanhox Mine in the Isle of Arran,but this closed shortly before the War. Among other places where baryteshas been worked are1 Occumster, in Caithness, Aberfoyle in Perthshire,Barlocco and Auchencairn in Kirkcudbrightshire. It; is also found at Stron-the near Loch Sunart in Argyllshire (see also paragraph 302). Some ex-ploration work has also been done recently on an occurrence at Myres Burnin the Ochil Hills. Elsewhere in Scotland the mineral is a common con-stituent of other mineral veins such as those of lead and zinc but is not usually present in sufficient quantities to justify exploitation.279. Evidence provided by the company operating Gasswater Mine indi-cates that at present about 40,000 tons of barytes are proved and blockedout, which is sufficient to last the mine two years at the present rate of output. It is reasonable to suppose, moreover, that normal development will enable the mine to continue in operation for at least five years with good prospects of a considerably longer life.280. Muirshiels Mine was still being developed at.the time pf the visit bythe Scottish Sub-Committee in January, 1948. It is now understood that further development has indicated that reserves of about 70,000 tons areproved with probable reserves of a further 50,000 tons,. Beyond this thepossibilities of the extensions of the ore-shoot in depth are good. further development is in progress, but until this has been done, however, it isnot possible to estimate what other reserves may be found.281. Diamond drilling at both Gasswater and Muifshiels Mines wouldenable a more accurate estimate to be made of reserves and prospects, butup. to the. date of the; visit of our Sub-Committee the companies had notbeen able as a matter of policy to spend money to prove reserves far ahead of existing workings.      Jv&apos; &apos;; .282. Regarding other occurrences of barytes, with the possible excep-tion of that now being investigated in the Ochil Hills, no information aboutproved or probable reserves is available, as little or no exploration hasbeen carried out. In some of the lead veins in Scotland barytes occurs asan associated mineral and there is the possibility of working it in conjunc-tion with lead.  Scottish barytes production was about 18,500 tons in 1947.CHROMITE, SERPENTINE, AND OLIVINE ROCK*283. These minerals have been recorded in workable quantities at twolocalities, Balta Sound, Unst (Shetland), and Corrycharmaig, Killin (Perth-shire). When first worked in Unst, from 1823-1876, chromite was sold for use as a pigment, but later for refractory purposes. In neither Pf the deposits hasthe mineral been exploited as an ore of chromium.284. Balta Sound, Unst. Chromite is found as concentrations withinserpentine rocks. The individual occurrences are either steeply inclined,irregular, and sheet-like bodies, or nodular masses. The sheet-like massesworked so far have been up to 12 ft. in thickness, and the largest hasyielded 3,000 tons of chromite rock. The largest nodular masses have yieldedup to 500 tons. It is estimated that about 40,000 tons of chromite rock were produced during the period 1823-1876 ; 5,757 tons (including 1,650 tons of* &quot; Talc, other Magnesium Minerals and Chromite associated with British Serpentines,&quot;Geological Survey, Wartime Pamphlet No. 9,1946, and Supplement No. 1,1949.
concentrates) between 1908-1927; and 3,907 tons from 1936-1944. The ore produced has so far averaged 26 per cent. Cr2O3 content. Working has been by quarries and it is said that all workable bodies exposed at the surface had been discovered in 1908, and that the quarries have mostly been worked as deep as open quarrying will safely and economically allow. There has been no chromite production since 1944.

285. An attempt was made in 1918 to concentrate the chromite by gravity. If this had been successful, it might have been possible to work lower grade material, but practical difficulties due to the nature of the ore were encountered.

286. Since chromite production ceased in 1944, occasional small shipments of serpentine have been made for refractory purposes.

287. Geological evidence suggests that other occurrences similar to those worked at the surface are likely to be discovered underground, and that further exploration is justified. The mineralogical nature of the ore bodies indicates that one or more methods of geophysical surveying could be utilised, combined with inclined diamond drilling from the surface. In the event of new chromite ore bodies of reasonable size, being discovered, there would be justification for a thorough metallurgical examination of representative bulk samples to ascertain whether modern developments in mineral dressing technique could be applied, since an effective concentration plant on the site might favourably influence the economics of production. At the same time the possibility of producing a chrome-serpentine refractory, on which some research has been done already, might be further investigated.

288. Corrycharmaig, Perthshire*. At this locality chromite (or chromium-bearing magnetite) occurs as scattered aggregates in various degrees of concentration within serpentine which forms part of a small intrusion of igneous rock. Parts of the serpentine are altered to talc (para. 310). The occurrence was worked for chromite in a small way about the middle of last century and it is stated that about 60 tons of ore were raised and sold in 1855-6. Recent work by the Geological Survey suggests, however, that the mass as a whole contains very little chromite, and that it is unlikely to prove a source of chrome ore, or of chrome refractory material. On the otherhand, a considerable area of the serpentine mass has been found to consist of a mineral known as breunnerite (an iron-bearing magnesite), and it is evident that further investigation is justified to ascertain whether a serpentine-magnesite rock could be worked on a large scale for refractory purposes. There is also the possibility of proving and developing the occurrence as a source of talc.

DIATOMITE 

289. The only deposit which, on present information, is likely to be of economic importance is that situated at Loch Cuithir in Skye which has already been worked to a small extent some years ago. Exploratory work at that time, including over 100 boreholes, showed the existence of a large deposit some 22 acres in extent. The diatomite underlies a few feet of surface peat and varies from 2 to 35 ft. in thickness. On a conservative estimate several hundred thousand tons of material is present. The crude diatomite is relatively low grade and it will have to be beneficiated to enable it to compete with imported diatomite. Previous attempts to work the Skye deposit have shown that in other respects the main economic factors are the cost of transport and the cost of drying on the site. It would appear that the

existence of large resources of this material in Skye would justify expenditureon research into methods of dressing and processing in an attempt to raisethe grade. We understand that a private firm has recently carried out testswith this object in view, and that arrangements are now in hand to develop the deposit.290. Other known occurrences of diatomite are of doubtful importance,with the possible exception of that at Dinnet Muir, Aberdeenshire, which, merits further investigation.FELSPAR291. A good deal of information about the occurrence of this mineralin Scotland has been recorded by the Geological Survey in a recent publica-tion.* Some of the occurrences have been considered as of potentialcommercial interest but only one so far has been Worked, and then only asa wartime measure. The chief uses of potash felspar in this country are for the production of various porcelain products, whereas soda felspar is usedfor the glass industry. Normally requirements are obtained from scandinavia and also in recent years to some extent from Canada.292. Potash felspar is mainly found as intrusive veins or irregular lenti-cular masses, usually small in size and of limited distribution, whereas sodafelspar (in those places where it may be of commercial interest) occurs as one of the mineral constituents in larger bodies of intrusive rock. There arefour main potash felspar localities:  (a) Island of S. Harris.(6) N.W. Sutherland.(c) Wester Ross,(d) S.E. Inverness.The chief localities for soda felspar are Ben Loyal and two other places in Sutherland.-293. During the 1914-18 War, some potash-bearing felspare deposits were examined as possible sources of potash for the manufacture of fertilisers,but the project did not materialise. This use was not considered again duringthe last War, but instead a re-examination was made to see whether any ofthe Scottish occurrences could be worked to produce high grade potashfelspar for the ceramic industry to replace lost Scandinavian imports.Occurrences in South Harris were tested and two of these were subsequentlyworked, one of which supplied the greater proportion of home requirementsthroughout the War. The cost, however, was much in excess of the pre-warimported material and the quality was inferior in respect of colour whichis an important consideration.294. Although at the moment it does not seem that any of these occur-rences can be worked commercially under ordinary conditions, the numberof occurrences of the felspar deposits and their composition suggests that further examination should be undertaken, combined with research work toascertain whether any method of processing could render lower gradematerial acceptable to the home market. This applies particularly to thelarge masses of intrusive rocks which are rich in soda felspar. It hasrecently been suggested that these latter deposits might be examined-toascertain whether there was any possibility of their development and use for making soda ash.    Exploitation at most of the above localities would. * &quot; Scottish Sources of Alkali Felspar &quot;.  Wartime Pamphlet No. 44, 1945.61
encounter transport difficulties, although other development schemes in the highlands might mean that in some places these difficulties would decrease infuture.  *GLASS SAND295. Sands suitable for making ordinary bottle glass are of widespreadoccurrence and therefore they have not been dealt with. High-grade sandsuitable for the better quality colourless glass ware was mostly imported&quot;before the War, chiefly from N.W. Europe. During the War, however, asatisfactory alternative source discovered by the Geological Survey wasdeveloped at Loch Aline, Morvera. No estimate has been made of theresources of sand, but they are believed to be ample. As first qualityLoch Aline sand is at least equal to the best continental sands* it is desirablethat efforts which are being made to retain home markets should be encouraged.HAEMATITE IRON ORE296. Several occurrences in different parts of Scotland including theOrkney and Shetland Islands are known, most of those showing any promisehaving been thoroughly tested already.  With the possible exception of theSandlodge Mine in Shetland, there is none that would seen to justify further.investigation.  No estimates are available of any ore reserves.LEAD AND ZINC ORES297. Ores of these metals have usually been found together and havebeen worked at some time or another on quite an extensive scale in thefollowing districts: Leadhills and Wanlockhead, Newton Stewart, Cars-phairn, Strontian, Tyndrum, Islay and at some other localities. In recentyears records of production may be summarised thus: TABLE XXIIPRODUCTION OF LEAD AND ZINC CONCENTRATES(tons)Year	Lead Concentrates (80 per cent. Pb)t			Zinc Concen-trates (45 percent.

Leadhills and Wanlockhead298. These two mines are about 2 miles apart, but worked the same series-of veins. Leadhills has been closed for nearly 20 years and Wanlockheadfor 15 years. In any future consideration of the re-development of lead min-ing, however, this area is the most important. In 1947 there still remained a nucleus of miners in the district and there was the chance that other menliving in the district but now employed on other work might be encouraged)   to return to mining if the prospect of long-term operations; arose. ,299. Ore reserves at Wanlockhead are known to amount to the equivalent of about 18,750 tons of 80 per cent, lead concentrates and about 12,500tons of 45 per cent, zinc concentrates, about one half of each being reason-I   ably certain and the remainder &quot; probable &quot;.  There is a lack of evidence&apos;   concerning any reserves at Leadhills.300. The reserves at Wanlockhead offer a reasonable short-term miningrisk, but the re-opening of the mine from the long-term point of view would have to be dependent upon the outcome of a large-scale exploratoryCampaign to prove and block out new ore-bearing ground. There is littledirect information about the chances of hew discoveries of ore of economic value being made, although it is reasonable to suppose that at Wanlockheadin particular many of the lodes would continue to be productive if exploredat lower levels. The area of ground lying to the west of Leadhills and north of Wanlockhead is also promising as it may contain productive exten-sions of known veins.301. The broad; conclusion of the Sub-Committee is that a determinedexploratory campaign based initially on Wanlockhead, and extendinggradually so as to open up the area of ground between the two mines atlower levels would have a reasonable chance of proving the existence of substantial new lead-zinc resources. It is not possible on the evidence available to be more specific.        ...... &quot;- .sOther Areas302. From the point of view of past production, four areas only have beenimportant; these are Tyndrum, the Island of Islay and Strontian (Argyll-shire), Newton Stewart and Carsphairn (Dumfriesshire). Mining operationsceased at Tyndrum and in Dumfriesshire about 20 years ago, but nothinghas been produced on the other areas since the last century. Generallyspeaking, present information does not indicate that ore reserves of any value exist in the mines, and geological information does not hold out any great promise that further exploration would yield substantial reserves.Nevertheless there is a prospect, for instance, at Strontian, that further exploration would prove worth while providing the undertaking was regardedas speculative, and it was understood that conclusive results one way or another could only be obtained after substantial expenditure.303. Information is too meagre for an opinion to.be given about future prospects in many of the smaller occurrences of lead and zinc ores known toour Scottish Sub-Committee and which have been tested from time to time.In one or two cases only does it suggest that further exploration might bejustified.MAGNETITE IRON ORE304. Magnetite resources of possible commercial significance are known in three areas and are described below.63
305. Shetland. An occurrence of magnetite situated at Clothister Hill,Sullom, Shetland, discovered by the Geological Survey (Scotland),; was ex-plored during the War by the Ministry of Supply and a preliminary magnet--ometer survey conducted- Some development was eventually carried out asa result of which it was estimated that 18,000 tons of proved ore existed,with a further 2,000 tons probable. About 1,000 tons of the ore were brought to the surface during the course of development.; It is unhkelythatfurther reserves of ore exist in this ore body although further exploratorywork in the immediate neighbourhood Would probably reveal other orebodies.&apos; ,iy, M -... Fie;    .. Uvs /V     ?,:i:fr.-, -vO306. Similar magnetic anomalies have been indicated elsewhere in Shet-land but all of these may not mean workable ore bodies. More geophysicalwork in the district, combined with diamond drilling, would, seem to bejustified, although subsequent development would only be likely to beeconomic if on a sufficiently large scale to warrant special loading andtransport facilities. mi to ,y;:,oq&apos;; tor   /-- \307. Skye. Small bodies of magnetite ore1 have been found by the Geo-logical Survey a few miles S.W. of Broadfprd and some exploratory work was carried out on them during the, War. At one&apos; Ideality magnetometersurveys indicated from 20,000 to 25,000 tons of ore to a depth:? pf 40 ft.,which was the limit of depth beyond which the magnetometer did hot pre-dict.  A similar estimate for aribther Ipcahtyb^was 12,000 tons down to 12 ft. Ndestimates Were possible at^ pther^tocalities,.It would appear that in aggregate a considerable tonnage of magnetite oremay exist in this area and that other occurrences! than those so fatTinvesti-gated may be found. Individual ore; bodies, ^however; are likely to be small and irregular, and difficult to work. As in the case of the Shetlandoccurrences, further exploration; seems justified, but. here again transport costs would have an important bearing on the economics of exploitation^308. Island of Tiree. Magnetometer work during the War on behalf of theMinistry of Supply, and in 1947 by Professor Whetton of the university of Leeds, following an earlier discovery by the Geological Survey, disclosedsubstantial anomalies indicating the existence of a vein-like deposit up to10 ft. wide in places: and with possibly considerable &quot;extehslbn in depth&apos;The occurrence may have a lateral extent of 3 to 4 miles and; the geophysicalwork carried out suggests either a considerably greater width than 10 ft.or the existence of parallel veins. The: pre contains an unduly high per-centage of phosphorus but it might be possible to reduce this by treatment:;As the occurrence is conveniently situated for shipment to the Clyde brelsewhere and relatively accessible, it seems dear that it is of sufficient importance to merit further investigation, for instance, by diamond drillingand further geophysical work. ;      \ \JrMICA J309. Several relatively small recurrences of muscovite mica in the High-lands of Scotland, chiefly in Inverness and Ross-shire, have been discoveredby the Geological Survey in recent-years, and a joint investigation with theNon-ferrous Mineral Development Control of the Ministry of Supply during1941-43 snowed that several were capable of yielding block mica of bestquality and grade suitable for use in,condensers and other high-grade electricalwork. A small but useful production was obtained during the War from oneor two of^ these localities, although, generally speaking, inaccessibility andthe small size of the occurrences made production costs high compared with
imported mica. While some allowance ;must be made for the difficult conditions of wartime operation, there is no suggestion as yet that any of the localities known could be worked economically other than on a very sinallscale. The fact that commercial mica does occur, however, suggests that further deposits may be found as detailed geologicarsunreyihg of the favour-able areas proceeds.   &apos; . &quot;&quot;, &apos; \ talc .: v 7 t &apos; &apos;       .310. The chief occurrence of this mineral of commercial interest is inShetland where it has been worked on the Mainland, *in the Island of Fetlar,and the Island. of Unst, the, last, being the most important. Talc has alsobeen worked in the Glenelg district of Ross where between 500 and 600 tons were quarried between 1931 and 1933. It also occurs. at Toward Point.Argyll, at Portsoy, Banffshire (where it is also worked) and atrCoCTychSimatg,Perthshire.        . &apos;&apos;&quot;        /ln^W&apos; V:r v,311. Shetland. Prior to 1940 the only output was 50 tons in 1922 and186 tons in 1923. As a result of local enterprise combined with the resultsof Geological Survey mapping, however, a new quarry was opened in 1940,since when a total of about 4i,200 tons-has been produced;:including Inearly500 tons of high-grade talc which is used in the manufacture of high-qualitypaper. 1 The lower grade material is^used-forrOofing felt.:! The,quarry is atpresent equipped for a production:of qnlyiL,500,tonsJbut;?it is:said:;that this could be increased to about 5,000 tons in a year or two.

BAUXITE316. Deposits of bauxite have long been known in the form of a thinbut extensive bed between the lower and upper basalt, mainly in CountyAntrim. Available records of production and values show that betweenthe years 1852 and 1915 a total output amounted to 292,596 tons (value 103,730), the highest production being 13,478 tons in 1883. Comparedwith imported material, the bauxite is low-grade and siliceous, and workingwas suspended at the end of the 1914-18 War. Operations were re-started in 1941 as a war measure and were expanded to the extent that eventuallyoutput reached a maximum of about 150,000 tons per annum. At theend of the war, however, when imported bauxite was freely available, workingWas again suspended. Considerable resources still exist and their distribu-tion is fairly well known, the bauxite horizon being proved over mostof the ground.DIATOMITE317. Deposits of diatomite are at present being worked near the outletfrom Lough Neagh. The raw material is of relatively low-grade in com-parison with some material at present being imported into the United King-dom. There would seem to be a case for research into methods of dressingand processing with a view to raising the grade.FELSPAR318. Veins of potash felspar of some economic value occur in Fermanaghwhere they gave rise to the establishment of the Belleek Pottery industry.Considerable quantities of the mineral were exported to England shortly afterthe 1914-18 War and 2,029 tons were worked during the recent war. Workinghas since been suspended. There is little information about reserves Ofthe mineral still available, and it is doubtful in present conditions whether further development would prove economic.IRON ORE319. This occurs mainly associated with bauxite Within the basalts! ofCounty Antrim. Mining commenced about 1860 and continued intermittentlyuntil the end of the 1914-18 War. During this period the output reached a maximum of 150,000 tons per annum (1873-1882), but on balance wasaround 50,000 tons. During the last War the total output was 11,874tons, but in view of the irregular nature of the deposit further investigation and research would be required before the large resources still existingcould be exploited economically on a substantial scale in post-war conditions.LEAD ORE320. Small veins of lead ore have been found in Counties Armagh and down some of which were worked during the early part of the last century.There is a record of an output of 1,000 tons of lead ore between 1850 and1861. It is not considered that they are of any importance at the presenttime, although little is known about them.POTASH321. The possibility-of an occurrence of this mineral in association withthe salt deposits of Carrickfergus was suggested during the 1914-18 War and small trials made at that time recorded traces of potash. There is no evidence suggesting that substantial deposits may be found, but furthertrials may be justified.
SALT322. Extensive deposits are known near tjarrickfergus, County Antrim,under similar geological conditions to those inwhich saltoccurein, England,Mines, and borings in the immediate vicinity of Carrickfergus have disclosedthree bands, eleven.feet, seventy-four feet, and thirty-seven feet in thicknessrespectively, separated by small thicknesses of rock. , At present salj is being produced from brine.

For all practical purposes it was not until the 1914-18 War thatthe government became directly interested in the development of the mineral resources^ of the country. As a matter of wartime expediency a Depart-ment was then set up under the Ministry of Munitions and equipped witha staff of engineers to investigate undeveloped or under-developed mineraloccurrences, and to encourage production. At the same time the GeologicalSurvey commenced special investigations into mineral resources and a seriesof special reports was prepared, eventually numbering over thirty. The first of these appeared in 1915, but the bulk of them was not published until after the War.  Many have since been revised.324. In all other respects, Government responsibility up to that time hadbeen exercised only in regard to the health and safety of workers in the mineral industries and in the collection of statistics; Mention should bemade, however, of the appointment of a Royal Commission to enquire intomining royalties. Their Report appeared in 1893 but few, if any, of their recommendations were adopted. &apos; \:        &apos; z&apos;u &apos;y&apos; ,325. In 1918 the results of the wartime investigations by the Governmentwere published in a Report by the Controller of the Department, Sir LionelPhillips. This Report drew attention to the need for greater information about mineral occurrences. i One of the principal recommendations, how-ever, was that a Mines Department should be set up with comprehensiveresponsibilities regarding the collection and publication of information aboutmineral resources and their efficient development in, the national interest:It was recommended that this Department should have- the general super-vision of the mineral industries and of the rates of royalties charged; thatit should have funds (but should be made largely self-supporting) to enablegeological studies of certain districts to be followed up by exploration.The Geological Survey (at that time under the Board pf Education) was recommended to be attached to the new Department :y-i        av326. In 1919 such mineral responsibilities as existed were exercised bythe Board of Trade which, following the publication of Lionel Phillips&apos;Report, appointed another Committee &quot;To investigate and report upon thepresent condition and economic possibilities of non-ferrpus mining in theUnited Kingdom and to make recommendations as, to such government action as may be expedient in regard thereto % That Committee recom-mended among other things that, other than coal, duties relating to minerals* &quot;Mineral Resourcss&quot; is here not restricted to MDC minerals. It is used in this widesense explained in the introduction; that is, coal and petroleum only are excluded.67
(split up between several Departments) should be centralised into, one organi-sation equipped with technical staff empowered to undertake geological,advisory, and statistical work and to provide funds for approved explorationand development. The Committee drew attention, mainly;&apos; in relation totiii mining in Cornwall, to the dangers of the industry and to its workers of mining companies starting Operations with insufficient capital or of dis-tributing profits too readily, so that in time of depression mines were oftenforced to close through lack of funds when development prospects were.stillreasonable. Trained miners became unemployed or left the district to workoverseas and mineral resources were either lost or their extraction made more expensive in future. Two members of the Committee in a reservationto the Report thought that the mines should be nationalised to prevent thesetwo things happening.327. The Mines Department of the Board of Trade was set up by theMining Industry Act, 1920, &quot; for the purpose of securing the most effectivedevelopment and utilisation of the mineral resources of the U.K. . .&apos;.&quot; but its statutory functions as defined in the Act were naturally largely related to coal and none of the specific functions in regard to other minerals as recommended in the 1918 or 1920 Reports appears to have been included.A section of the Mines Department was established, however, to deal withother minerals but it seems to have done nothing other than to collectstatistics. It is true that as provided in the Act a standing Advisory Com-mittee was appointed known as the Metalliferous Mines Advisory Committee.In 1930 this Committee was asked to report specifically on the possibilityof reviving or developing the Working of metalliferous or associated deposits,but was informed that the Government was against the direct grant offinancial assistance. Nevertheless the recommendations of the Committeein a Report published in 1932 included proposals for a geo-physical andeconomic geological survey of the Leadhills-Wanlockhead area, South Scot-land, and the provision of funds for constructing a combined drainage andtransport tunnel to serve the needs of the Camborne-Redruth tin mine dis-trict. Three members of the Committee, however, signed a reservation tothe Report to the effect that the conclusions were unduly optimistic aboutthe prospects of non-ferrous metalliferous mining and that public money should not be spent on any scheme offering uncertain prospects. An interest-ing recommendation of this Committee Was that legislation already applic-able to coal mines under the Coal Industry Act, 1926 (see below) whereby&apos;consolidated leases could be granted to ensure efficient exploitation of adeposit in the hands of several owners, should be extended to metalliferousmines. This recommendation (but in respect of certain minerals only)Was adopted by the Mines (Working Facilities) Act, .1934 but none of theother recommendations of this Committee appears to have been implemented.328. A note about the Working Facilities and Supports legislation enactedbetween the two Wars would be appropriate at this point since it represents the first attempt on the part of the Government to ensure that mineral development is not impeded by recalcitrant owners or that the terms andconditions of working are not so onerous that the mineral becomes un-economic. The Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act, 1923, gavepower to the Government through the Railway &amp; Canal Commission togrant rights to work minerals which might otherwise be rendered unwork-able because of exceptional reservations or other legal restrictions. TheAct also ensured that ancillary rights such as wayleaves could be secured.Provisions of this Act were extended by the Mining Industry Act, 1926 (butonly in respect of coal) to give any person the right to make application
to search for or work coal should the Railway &amp; Canal Commission decide that it was expedient in-the national interest that such a right should begranted. Further powers; were given to the Commission to hear -applied-* tions in respect of restrictive terms or conditions, in mining leases and, ifexpedient, to free the lessees wholly or partially from such restrictions of conditions. As stated above, the(provisionsjof these two.Acts regarding:theworking facilities i were extended to: certain other i minerals; by the i Mines(Working Facilities) Act, 1934: (iron -ore and; ironstone, tin ore, lead sore,zinc ore, copper ore, tungsten ore, fluorspar, barytes and;&apos;oil: shale)..-, this legislation thus removed certain legal restrictions ^associated with private ownership. of minerals which it was gradually coming to be recognised werehindrances to mineral development and particularly to mineral exploration.3291: The /Government first became directly and &apos;. actively concerned in. the mineral resources of the country about .1920, when a considerable expansionof the Geological Survey was made chiefly to enable coalfields.to be mapped ;the Coal Survey, under the Department of Scientific ahd Industrial Research,was also set up.- h*ii[i : tfa-fi &amp;rtwm$H ^xnmiJ.    .. &amp;vf%i mtj.330. The first; official step towards Ownership of natural mineral resourcescame in 1934, when the Petroleum (Production) Act became law. Thisvested in the Crown the property in petroleum and natural gas in GreatBritain. The Act made no provision for compensation to the owners ofthe mineral rights concerned, for at that time no important undergroundresources of natural petroleum were known in this country. This &quot;was followed in 1938 by the Coal Act, which constituted the Coal Commissionand secured the unification of ownership of coal in the hands Cf the Corn-mission by the acquisition of the &quot; fee simpleCompensation to existingowners for the acquisition of their interests was payable but of an aggregatesum in respect of the whole country amounting to  66,450,000, theallocation of which was decided by a central valuation boards wbrkingthrough regional valuation boards. One of the duties of the Coal Com-mission Was to make recommendations in cases where-in their view the amalgamation of undertakings was necessary in order to secure the&apos; most efficient development of coal deposits in the national interest. another was to exercise their functions as owners in such a manner as to promote the interests, efficiency and better organisation of the coal mining industry.They were also given the power to. search and bore for coal but were not themselves to engage in mining. .&apos;-331. On the outbreak of war in 1939 those Departments interested in theend uses of minerals and mineral products took powers under the emergency powers Act in relation to production and distribution. The arrangementsthen made are, broadly speaking, those in force today, and the divisionof responsibility may be summarized briefly as follows:  Coal,  Petroleum,   Oil  Shale, Ministry of Fuel and Power.Lignite and Peat.             &apos;,Metalliferous Minerals (and a Ministry of Supply,few others).Non-metalliferous      minerals Board of Trade,(with some exceptions)&quot;.      -A few minerals used mainly Ministry of Works and Ministry offor building materials and road- Transport. &apos;--making.                                  , v.          .332. The arrangement was arrived at because of the practical difficulty,particularly in wartime, of separating responsibility for production fromthat for distribution and use. . J; .4,--;&apos;  ,
333. The Ministry of Fuel &amp; Power Act, 1945, provided for a restorationof the 1939 administrative position buti for the first time, it included mineral development as a responsibility of Government, the actual wording being. . general duty of securing the effective and co-ordinated developmentof coal, petroleum and other minerals . . .&quot;. Since.1945, however, the war-time position has been more or less maintained largely on account of theeconomic position of the country which has necessitated the continuanceof many of the wartime arrangements. The present position is, therefore,-that while statutdrily the Ministry of Fuel and Power has been given along-term interest in mineral development, other Departments acting asproduction authorities for minerals in which they are interested in the enduses are dealing with the mining industries concerned, and not the; Ministryof Fuel and Power. The nature of the interest of these Departments is largely short-term in character; it inevitably excludes long-term considera-tions, and thus comprehensive technical knowledge which could only be remedied if one Department had the overall responsibility.334. The Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947, introduced a new phase of Government interest in the mineral industry. Under these Acts mineralworkings, whether underground or on the surface, became subject to planning control, and the development value of minerals has been severed from the ownership, in the same way as development values are removed from the ownership of land, and vested in the Central Land Board. These Acts arefurther discussed in Chapter VIII..The Function of the Geological Survey335. The Geological Survey was founded well over a hundred years agowith the object of preparing and publishing maps and memoirs covering the detailed geology of the United Kingdom (now Great Britain). This is stillrecognised as the primary function of the institution and under normalconditions the majority of the staff are engaged on this work. The chieffunctions of the Geological Survey and Museum may be briefly summarisedas follows :  /(i) The preparation and publication Of geological maps and memoirs of.England, Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man.(ii) The special investigation of the coalfields, iron ore fields, and thedistribution of non-ferrous ores and rocks and minerals used for industrial purposes generally.(iii) The investigation of the geology, supplies and distribution of under-ground water.(iv) The furnishing of expert advice and information to GovernmentDepartments, Mining and Industrial interests, and to the public generally. -(v) The maintenance and development of the Museum of PracticalGeology both as an educational institution and as an instrument for research into the various branches of geology, pure and applied.(vi) The carrying out (in recent years) of research work into the applica-tion of various methods of geophysical prospecting. It is under-stood that further work of this character, possibly on an enlargedscale, will be carried out in the future.The Geological Survey and Museum is primarily a research establishment and in common with the other branches Of D.S.I.R. its work is concentrated upon problems of basic research of scientific Or industrial importance. its purpose is to provide fundamental geological facts or conclusions required
by science or industry and on wMch more detailed^investigatioiis beyond thescope of the Geological Survey can beifounded. The programme of workof the Geological Survey is drawniUp by an independent board nappointedby D.S.I.R/sin;consuItation withthe Director. (The Ministry of Fuel and power is represented on this Board;)The programme  is reviewed by theBoard annually. &apos;       .    -! &apos; - 1336. It will be apparent, haying regard&apos;,to its main,gepjpgical functions;,that it will only be in special^circumstances such &quot;as wartime, that&quot; a largeproportion of the relatively small staff couldbe allocated to specialinyestiga-tions on other minerals. There are still large areas of the United kingdom which have not yet been primarily surveyed on a 6 in. to the mile scale andin the economic field responsibilities iri^regard&apos; to the cibalfieids mind tounderground water supplies are obviously j of relatively greater national importance. Special investigations on niineral resources were; commencedduring World War I and, as stated above, a series of economic memoirscovering minerals or groups of rmnefals thrbughbut Great! Britain has been published. Some of these pubficatioPs&apos; have recendy been revised&quot; and inmost of the major mineral fields a thorough re-investigation, mainly ona regional basis, was begun before 1939 and has now been largely com-pleted although the results are not all published.   ;k; /. jl:-\337. The general purpose of such mineral inyestigations is to collect, collateand interpret all information available with regard to the, geology, mode ofoccurrence, existence and distribution,, of mineral occurrences and theirpotential economic importance. It is not considered to be a function of the geological Survey to undertake prospecting or development work necessaryfor the economic evaluation of a mineral deposit. This is work that calls forthe services of mining engineers, metallurgists, and other specialists; andnecessitates boring, mining operations; mineral testing and research.338. The nature of the information and assistance which the GeologicalSurvey can render when mineral development is planned falls under twoheadings :  .....,(i) They can provide geological information on which a programme ofprospecting can be based. , ,&apos; &apos;\&quot;(H) They can provide geological advice and assistance during the-course: of the investigation. - * i    u*i ^   iThe relationship between the Geological Survey and the new mineral development Commission which we propose is discussed in Chapter XI.CHAPTER VIIMINING TAXATION        .339. For many years the mining industry has maintained that nationaltaxation is too onerous and that in its application an exceptionally heavy burden is placed upon mining enterprise. Their main contention is that theeconomic and technical risks in mining are unusually high and that for manyyears there has been little incentive to search for new mineral depositswhen taxation so substantially limits the reward obtained on the outlay ofmoney at such risk.340. Representations made by the industry have mainly been concernedwith mining overseas where the greater part of the capital of most miningcompanies registered in this country&apos;is invested.   Companies operating in
the U.K., however, have generally, maintained that the same argumentsapply with equal force in this country and it has been commonly claimed that the incidence pf taxations particularly in recent years, is &quot;one of &quot;themain, if not the only reason for the decline of mining activity K I It mustbe added that such claims have had in mind more particularly &quot;lodemining&quot;, that is, in the U.K. the mining of ores of the base metals tin,tungsten, lead and zinc together with such minerals as barytes and fluorspar,which have a similar mode of occurrenceand distribution. 1...341. The chief evidence available to the Committee has been providedby:- - &apos; ;&apos;:^\/ /Institution of Mining &amp; Metallurgy, ,, &apos;J[Federation of British Industries,Association of British Chambers of Commerce, :ui! ; :British Overseas Mining Association,, ,n-    , ./    V,Joint Committee of the Accountancy Institutions,;,;,Professor S. J. Truscott, D.Sc, A.R.S.M., M.I.M.M.    ^      V       i342. Our examination has been conducted under three main headings:-(a) The extent to which the Income Tax Act, 1945, and the finance act, 1947, met claims from the industry for allowances in respectof &quot; capital expenditure &quot; incurred in connection with the workingof a source of mineral deposits of a-wasting nature &quot;.(b) Claims for allowances in respect of expenditure on the acquisitionof the mineral source or the rights over it. ;, :(c) Whether special new taxation concessions to mining should be recom-mended to encourage production or more efficient exploitation.Our observations and conclusion under each of these headings are given below.     . -   - . j &apos; &quot;    vj,;-.-/343. (a) Generally speaking, claims by the industry for taxation concessionsby way of allowances for expenditure on exploration, development, shaftsinking, etc. (which were not admitted prior to 1945) have been largelyconceded by the Income Tax Act of that year. It is admitted by the industry that the provisions of this Act go a long way to meet the grievances.Expenditure of the kind mentioned can now be written off for taxationpurposes over the life of the mine and it is clear that what was one of the major financial handicaps to mining development prior to 1945, has nowbeen removed.We have examined the Act in conjunction with evidence we have received to see whether there still remain any inequalities in the incidence of taxation on mining as compared with other industries. In our view there are differ-ences between mining and other industries as a result of which the formersuffers adversely, although the differences are of degree only. Firstly, thereis usually a greater risk in mining because of the uncertain nature of the mineral occurrence ; for, instance, the grade of the deposit may show un-expected variations, or working conditions may become more difficult.The difference is greatest in lode mining where the risk is highest. Secondly,there is the uncertainty about the life of the deposit. Thirdly, there is therisk of violent fluctuations in market prices. All sections of industry haveto face this latter risk, some more than others, but in mining, particularlymetalliferous mining, past experience has shown that the risk of violentfluctuations is highest.  Fourthly, there is usually a much longer and more
costly development period in mining before profits are earned. The first two, mining risk and the life factor, are both differences which, becauseof their intangibility and variation; cannot, in our view be satisfactorily andequitably met by special taxation concessions. We go into this in more detail under (c) below. Similarly, in our opinion, the third difference is not susceptible of.being counteracted by the medium of taxation.; With regardto the fourth difference, however, we consider that the principle now ad-mitted by the Inland Revenue, and, incorporated in the 1945 Act does, not go far enough, and the mining industry is&apos; still ? relatively at a disadvantage in one or two respects. Taxation concessions are Of no assistance to an industry unless profits are being made,.. It is important, therefore, that theprinciple should be extended so that provision is made for all expenditure incurred in the opening and development of a mine to be allowed as a charge against the profits of the mine; For instance, as the law now stands,it is doubtful if allowances for payments for surface damages and other payments of a similar kind are included. Furthermore, mining concernswhich incur losses in their early years computed in accordance with theexisting law cannot carry. forward the revenue expenditure represented inthose losses beyond the six years of assessment following the year in whichthe expenditure was incurred. At present the six-year period allowableunder the Finance Act, 1926 is too short having regard to particular needs ofthe&apos;mining industry as compared with other industries. In comparison withthe important new principle introduced by the 1945 Act, the extra concessionsneeded to meet the point made above arc of a-relatively&apos; minor character,and may be summarised as follows: -- &apos;(i)iAU expenditure except (a) any expenditure on the acquisition ofthe site of the source, or of the site of any works or of the rights inor over any such site, (fe) any expenditure on the acquisition of, or of rights in or over, mineral deposits (both of which are nowregarded by the Inland Revenue as being of a Capital nature arid,.v. therefore, not chargeable against.profits) where not otherwise pro-vided for should be allowed as charges against profits having regardto its effective life or the life of the mine, whichever the shorter,and &apos; &quot;.: &apos;;u &quot;(ii) Losses incurred in the early years of operation of a mining concern,computed in accordance with existing legislation, should be chargedagainst the first profits available, with no limit on the period during&apos; which they can be carried forward. ; ;344. (b) The other class of expenditure for which allowances are claimed by the mining industry, arid which is at present specifically excluded (IncomeTax Act, 1945, Section 25 (I)), is that incurred in the acquisition of the mineral source or rights over it. Frorii evidence we have received it appearsthat the question is of special significance to U.K. mining companies operating overseas, and it is to be.noted that a Committee of Enquiry wasappointed by the Treasury in September, 1948*, to examine the clajms made and to advise whether further modification of taxation is justified in thisrespect so that U.K. companies operating abroad are not at a disadvantage in comparison with foreign mining companies With whom they are in competition.There has been a good deal of misunderstanding in the past about theterminology used in regard to this claim, and about claims made in respectof expenditure represented by &quot; wasting &quot; assets in general. According toevidence submitted to us (particularly by the British Overseas Mining* This Committee has reported, and since the date when our Report was signed- some provision for expenditure of this class has been proposed in the Finance Bill, 1949.   &apos;.&apos;: &apos;
Association) expenditure in this category is that in connection with thepurchase of the mineral before it is mined, or with that on securing rights over the mineral deposit, and with this we agree. 1 The annual allowanceclaimed to amortize this expenditure is known as &quot;depletion allowance&quot;,and is to be distinguished from allowances granted by the Income TaxAct, 1945, in respect of other expenditure of a wasting nature, i.e., develop-ment (see para. 343 above).Some U.K. mining companies, notwithstanding the new concessions allowed by the Income Tax Act, 1945, still feel that they should be allowed to claim a depletion allowance, despite the fact that the companies concernedlease their mineral rights in the ordinary Way and pay royalties on the mineral extracted and sole. They did not incur any expenditure in acquiringthe right to mine except perhaps nominal fees in connection with takingout the lease, and they did not purchase the minerals outright. Tax isdeductible on the payment of royalties and tax relief is granted when profitsare earned. In fact, therefore, companies in this position are not concernedwith depletion as defined above. There are, however, some examples ofindustries in the U.K. where companies have purchased outright someOr all of the mineral rights of the deposits they are working, althoughit is the exception rather than the rule for those minerals with which theCommittee are dealing, and the question of depletion, therefore, does notoften arise. - , &apos;       X&apos;.&apos; X.. &apos;&apos;   &apos;&quot;The conception behind the claim for a depiction allowance is that themining company, by making payments of this kind, acquires an asset in thenature of stock-in-trade represented by the mineral in the ground which isbeing gradually reduced in value as the mineral is extracted, and whichbecomes nil when the mine is worked out. It is, therefore, claimed that provision should be made in Income Tax legislation for amortising-thecost of the mineral asset or the rights oypr, it by charging an appropriatesum each year against profits before the latter have been taxed. It maybe noted here that the non-allowance of such sums against profits for tax purposes is not peculiar to the mining industry; mention might; be made,for instance, of premiums on leases, and there are other examples.In view of the fact that the special Committee recently appointed bythe Treasury is examining the principle of this claim in regard to U.K.mining companies operating overseas, it is undesirable for us to commentfurther*. So far as the future is concerned the question should not againarise in the case of new mining companies operating in the U.K, sinceeither under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947,or under the new administrative arrangements for minerals we propose inthis Report there will be no need for payments of this kind. If the merits of the claim by U.K. overseas mining companies are eventually considered to be justified or if they receive retrospective concessions in this respect, theposition of those domestic companies who have made payments of thiskind should be considered in relation to the compensation they receivein return for the &quot; development value&quot; under the Town and country planning Acts, and the manner in which they are allowed to deal with it for tax purposes.345. (c) Quite apart from the application of taxation in regard to capitalexpenditure is the much broader question&apos;pf whether taxation can be useddirectly to encourage mining or any particular aspect of it, that is, exploration,production and efficient exploitation. In principle this method is in usein certain parts of the British Commonwealth. In some respects it wouldappear to be one of the easiest ways, short of direct subsidy of the price* See footnote on previous page.74
of the product, of encouraging mineral development. The main argument used is nearly always the lack of incentive given by a high taxation rate in comparison with the risk factor. Unfortunately the risk is variable, and for this and other reasons it would not be practicable to make any general relief fair to the industry as a whole and which would not, at the same time, create undesirable precedents. We have come to the conclusion that preferential tax concessions to encourage mineral development and production would not be the correct long-term remedy. The problem is much too complex to be dealt with in this way, and we consider that there are other more suitable methods available which are more likely to meet the varying needs of the industry and to be more in accord with the national interest. These are discussed in later chapters.

346. Royalties and taxation. Royalties paid by mining companies to mineral owners are usually in the form of annual payments which are therefore allowable for tax purposes. Our recommendation later in this Report that mineral rights should be nationalised should not affect this general principle. After 1951, in any case, a "development charge" will become payable to the Central Land Board by the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947 (para. 356), and Regulations provide for the development charge to be calculated either as a charge on tonnage or in other ways. Whether or not mineral rights are nationalised, however, we recommend that development charges should always be imposed as annual payments and not as capital sums.

CHAPTER VII

MINERAL RIGHTS AND PLANNING

Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947

347. Regulations made under Section 81 of the Town and Country Planning Act, (Scotland) Act, 1947, empower the Minister and the Secretary of State respectively, with Treasury consent, to apply the provisions of the Acts, with such adaptations and modifications as may be necessary, to mineral workings. In consequence of these Acts, mining operations in Great Britain, whether underground or on the surface, are now within the scope of planning control, and the State has acquired the development value in minerals. At first sights, therefore, it might seem that the statutory administrative powers already possessed by the Ministry of Town and Country Planning and the Central Land Board (and by the Secretary of State in Scotland) are already sufficient to safeguard the interests of future mineral development.

348. Further examination of the provisions of the Acts and of the regulations made thereunder, however, has confirmed our opinion, originally communicated to the Minister of Fuel and Power in January, 1947, immediately after the Town and Country Planning Bill had been published, that the method devised to secure planned development and control of the use of the land surface was not intended primarily for, and can only be regarded as a stage in, policy for securing effective control and development of our mineral resources.* Considered in relation to the MDC minerals,

* Although many of our remarks in this Chapter are generally applicable to all mineral deposits and workings, it is important to remember that we are considering the implications of the Town and Country Planning Acts in relation to MDC minerals only.


the conception that control oyej; mineral workings,, and thus over mineral development,&apos; can be exercised in a similar ^ay to that over land, is [ opento grave technical objections.: We recognise the necessity;to bring mineralworkings within the sphere of land use control generally, although theextent to which the Working of mdc minerals denies the use of the surfaceof the land for other/purposes is often small in comparison with othermineral workings, and amenity considerations are less likely to arise. we also recognise that the positive power in the Planning Acts for the cdrn-pulsory purchase of land for mineral working 3r for the compulsory grantof working rights toy the Railway, ah^ CanalCourt) must be exercised with due regard td-the eeohbmic tieedsnbf the mineral industry and the production needs of&apos; the country. arrangements can be made by those Departments at present responsible&apos;for&quot;production toensure that necessary mineral-resources are made. ,avadable,to .the industry.Nevertheless, we do not consider that control over mineral workings inrelation to land use generally, notwithstanding the existence of these powers,can be exercised in such a way that;,it could effectively toe, used.also as a means of fostering mineral development. The approach in the case of land use control is fundamentally different from that which.is ^necessary in apolicy specifically designed to encourage mineral, development. Althoughland use control of mineral workings, as provided for by the Planning Actsand Regulations, may be of considerable assistance to mineral development,we can only regard it as negative; in the sense that it is. governed by permissivelegislation. A policy to encourage nurieral development, dh the other hand,must be positive. It arises directly from the need to foster the productionof known minerals and the stimulation of the discovery and evaluationof new mineral deposits. It is essential that it provides, for instance, forthe starting of comprehensive exploratory schemes in certain areas, the compulsory amalgamation of undertakings where necessary on technical grounds, for the metallurgical investigation of low-grade mineral deposits and for research into many kinds bf mining and mineral dressing questions.349. The problem of developing minerals is made more difficult becauseresources are mainly underground, ahd their extent and vaflueis1 thus oftenunknown or difficult to ascertain. The proved reserves,pf some; mineraldeposits of relatively great industrial importance, are^^Ibeepming &quot;dangerpuslydepleted.: The chances of making important new discoveries, however, are by no means exhausted and exploration should be actively pursued. &quot;we appreciate the reasons for deciding not to exclude, the mdc.minerals fromthe general provisions of the Town and Country&quot;Planning Acts, but,as.stated above, we can only regard this as the first stage of a development policy.The later stages must be concerned in devising and implementing, a.positivepolicy for dealing with mdc minerals as national wasting assets, and withthe discovery and development of new mineral deposits.Development Plans ;J350. Under the Acts, Local Planning Authorities (usually the county or Borough Councils in England and Wales, and County or: large BurghCouncils in Scotland) have the responsibility of preparing development plansindicating the manner in which it is proposed that land shall be used andthe stages by which any development should be carried out. This! will necessitate the scheduling of land for mineral , working. In some areasconflicting claims of other land uses such as building, agriculture, new roads,new reservoirs, will have to be resolved on a long-term basis. As we indicatelater in Chapter X, technical knowledge about the pccurrences and resourcesof the mdc minerals is totally inadequate, and in many cases ft could onlybe obtained by extensive exploration of the kind which private undertakingscould not, in general, be expected to finance. 4!
351. We are informed that the Ministry of Town and Country Planning;even from their viewpoint&apos; (which, as we have. pointed * but, does: hot includeactive steps^forenbouraging mineral&apos; development) have recognised that agood deal of technical information, both geological and i economic,; is necessary before their own task can:be completed^ They recognise, too, that the local planning&apos; Authbrities cahhot iridividually and- without guidance, ieompilethisinformation^ and relate -it to the economic needs oof the industry * and theproduction requirements of - the country as a whole: Arrangements have accordingly been made for   joint ^discussions; ^between;either: Ministry^f theAssodatiohs representing the various: mineral industries, and the GovernmentDepartments concerned (including those s at present responsible for pro-duction), with a view to compiling the necessary data, and then consideringwith the&apos; Local &quot;Planning? Authorities what problems, arise in their areas inconnection with minerals and what the- solution should be. The GeologicalSurvey are assisting in this Work, and?in-some cases the;Ministry has alsosecured the assistance of outside experts by setting up Advisory; committees or u Standing Conferences, u 11 In u others,:; the Trade Associations; themselvesretain.the services; of expert.geologists or mining engineers, whose assistance is usually readily made available at these discussions,   v &apos;.-:k       WAimM352. The process PutUned in the preceding paragraph is as yet. in its early stages, and has been gradually built up since January, 1946, whenmineral working was brought fully within planningycohfrpl.^ The Ministryof: Town and Country Planning recognise that the completion of theirplanning work&apos; Will take some; considerable&apos;! &quot;time-and that7 in fact; it can never be complete because it is by its nature a continuous process ^equirmgconstant review and adaptation in the light of changing economic andindustrial, circumstances. They aim (at.tackling; the;more urgent;, aspectsfirst, with a view to avoiding undue sterilisation of &quot;rsecuring production needs for a long period ahead.     &quot;I/      i;^.&quot; y353. We are informed that the information thus obtained will be used&apos; aspart of the statistical&apos;&apos;data necessary to^see the land planning problem inrelation to the production problem and te knowh: or possible resbufces. Theinformation will be of considerable value, but, as stated above, something more positive is required in the interests of mineral development as a whole.In pur View, this can; only come from a direct and centralised approachthrough an organisation With specific functions. It cannot be achieved as aresult of land- use planning based On the provisions of the Town and1 country planning Acts, particularly when each mineral has to be considered separately,as at present, between the Ministry Of Town and Country Planning and theproduction Department Concerned. Until there&apos; is a permanent authorityexclusively charged with mineral- development responsibility, it is clear thatour resources of minerals must suffer in the long run for want of an overall,long-term and properly co-ordinated policy for the country as a whole.354. As in the case of each of the other industries; depending on natural resources; of the country such as agriculture, forestry; and waterpower, primary responsibility for the assessment, development, conservation^ and utilisation of minerals must be vested in one Minister. One of the duties of this minister should be to provide the necessary technical information to the, Minister of town and Country Planning who would use it to assist him in exercisingcontrol of land use. The arrangements now being made by the Ministry of town and Country Planning would have been greatly simplified if the mineral development Commission we recommend (Chapter XI) had been in existenceprior to the enactment of the Planning Acts.* Under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932.77
Permission to Work       .r..355. As from 1st July, 1948, no new mine or quarry can be started without permission from a Local Planning Authority, who can fe: conditions underwhich the development is allowed to proceed, Such conditions are likely tobe mainly concerned with the preservation of amenities, with the safeguarding of other land uses, and (mainly surface minerals) with restpratiqni after worteing or by treatment of the site to bring it back into some form of iprpduetiyeuse. The Ministry of Town and Country Planning have; recognised, thatit may sometimes be inadvisable for decisions with regard to certamjmiueralsto be taken locally, and instructions have been&apos;-issued to local-planning authorities to inform the Minister of; applications for i permission; -to workcertain specified minerals: in order that he can; consider^:.inter alia, whetherresponsibility for the decision can be left with the Local Planning; authority or whether he ought to take it over for Government decision. The list is confined to minerals in relatively short supply and includes most of themdc minerals. From the long-term point of view we regard it as essentialthat the Minister of Town and Country Planning, or the Secretary of Statefor Scotland as the case may be, should rely upon consultations cwith oneMinister responsible for all mdc minerals, in any case where an appeal against.conditions of working is made under the Acts, especially as in manycases the safeguarding of other &quot;-lajid fuses, surface restoration and other conditions, will - increase the cost of producing minerals. &quot;Atpresent;),^ieMinister of Town and Country ^according; to the mineral concerned, because of the divided ,prqductiohresponsibilities. .:^* &amp;v;;\ sd&apos;The Development Charge &apos;&apos;&apos; -v^rno-j356. One of the principal features of the Town and Country Planning Acts,so far as we are concerned, is that the acquisition of the development value inminerals by the State and the payment by all operators after July, 1951, of a development charge to the Central Land Board, effectively removes all incen-tive from mineral, owners to get their minerals developed. Mineral owner-ship, therefore, will, be little more than nominal, because permission; is.required before development can take place, and owners have-no power toprevent development if it is deemed to be,in the; national interest. Moreover,the development charge will replace all existing royalties, and as the charge is calculated as one hundred per cent, of the difference between the existing use value of minerals (which is, of course, nil) and the development value, the mineral owner receives no further payment by way, of royalty if the mineralsare worked, other than such provision as is. made&apos;for compensation, m respectof surface damage or disturbance if mineral rights and surface, rights are notsevered. It would also appear that-other than;any payment received underPart VI of the Act in respect of depreciation of his interest in minerals, the mineral owner will not be left with any payment sufficient to meet the costs of management arising out of ownership, such as the upkeep or fencing of old shafts, and the storage of mining records. ;;[       &apos; &apos;357. As yet there is little information about the method to be used in fixingdevelopment charges. The only tangible expression of the development value of mineral properties is that determined by. the scale of: royaltiespreviously paid, which represented, a bargain between a willing&apos; mineraloperator and a willing mineral owner: in consequence, development chargesmay be expected to be roughly of the same order ; in amount as existingroyalties.     ; &apos;-  &apos;     f, -      &apos;&apos; ; &apos;/&quot;&apos;;,sv&apos;: &apos;r&apos;: ; &apos;       l&apos;&apos;f!0&apos;l358. The application of the Act in regard to development Charges onmineral workings is likely to be much moire rigid and inflexible than thatgoverning the terms of mining leases and royalties: under the old system.  In
principle, the development charge is a purely financial control. It seems clear that from its constitution the Central Land Board will be primarily a revenue-collecting body : while it will clearly try to avoid "killing the goose that lays the golden eggs" it will not be in the same position as a private mineral owner who could, if need be, so adjust the level of royalties laid down in the leases to meet changed conditions, or to reduce or suspend them where necessary to counterbalance the degree of the initial risk. He thereby exercised a measure of technical control over working efficiency and development.

359. The mineral owner will no longer be interested in such matters and we certainly could not regard it as a proper function of the Central Land Board even if they wished to undertake such control, which seems hardly likely. It would also be inappropriate, in our opinion, for such responsibilities to be exercised by Local Planning Authorities, who are best suited to safeguard local land use and amenity considerations.

360. Under Section 81 (2) (c) of the Act, the development charge can be related to the amount of minerals got. Although the Regulations allow the charge to be assessed by other methods recognised as appropriate to the minerals concerned, there is no direct provision for the development charge to be assessed either wholly or partially as a percentage of annual profits, as distinct from a charge on output. It may sometimes be the case in mining certain types of minerals that such a method might be more logical and more equitable to all concerned. It is a method which, with suitable modifications to meet particular cases, should be available for use if required in conjunction with a general policy of mineral development, whereas the development charge in its present form could not be so used.

Control of the right to work minerals

362. Assuming that an area in which minerals occur has been scheduled for mineral working on a development plan by the Local Planning Authorities, the different steps which a prospective mineral operator will have to take in future may be summarised as follows:-

(a) Permission must be obtained from the Local Planning Authority (para. 355). Permission may be subject to conditions of working and there is a right of appeal to the Minister which, it may be anticipated, will be frequently invoked.

(b) A lease must be negotiated with the mineral owner (or owners). As a mineral owner will have no incentive to have his minerals worked this would probably be refused.

(c) The prospective operator will then have to take action to have the right to work minerals compulsorily assigned to him which will mean application to:-

(i) The High Court, under the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act, 1923 or to

(ii) The Local Planning Authority or the Central Land Board to get an order for the compulsory acquisition of the land concerned. This may be unnecessary use of such powers merely to enable some MDC minerals to be worked underground, when all that is required is rights over a small surface area for mine buildings, etc.


N.B. If mineral rights and surface rights are severed (often :them case with mdc minerals) both steps (i) and (ii) will be necessary,unless freehold of the surface is subject to a reservation of rights for mineral working or agreement can be reached I with the surfaceowner ; if no severance, the right to work could be secured by (ii).id) Negotiations have to be opened with, the Central Land Board to fix a development charge.    : ; n .o     -        \mp.363. It is clear that as a consequence of the Act, both parties concernedin mineral development, that is the mineral owner and the prospectiveoperator, have a reduced incentive to reach agreement as to. the basis onwhich work could be started. Alternatively, where a prospective mineraloperator is anxious to work minerals and wants to avoid /the, process&quot; of attempting to secure his rights compulsorily, he may even be tempted toenter into private arrangements with the mineral owner which must, ineffect, add to the cost of the mineral undertaking.    -&apos;.//// ;:,        ;364. Obviously it is premature to attempt to draw safe conclusions, butit does seem that the effect may well be Virtually to stop exploration./; Itwill certainly discourage it. Prospective mineral operators would be [deterred from initiating action for compulsory acquisition or the grant of wprkingrights against an unwilling mineral owner when the first objective wa/s to explore and not to work. Previously, the risk was wbrth; taking when/itwas Comparatively easy to get prospecting licences from willing owners., oftenon favourable terms for the first two or three years/. Section 103 (9); ofthe Act gives power to &quot;search/and bore for the purposeof ascertaining thenature of the subsoil or the presence of numerals therein&quot;. While this jthayhelp in the case of some surface mineral deposits, it does not seem to be designed to cater for exploration which for most mdc minerals involvesextensive and prolonged mining operations as well as boring:     . V ..-)&apos;Nationalisation of Mineral Rights.365. There are strong technical arguments in favour of nationalising themdc mineral rights and dealing with.them by way of new administrativepowers which will act more directly to ensure adequate exploration, develop-ment and efficient working. The Town and Country Planning Act does notaim at removing the present complexities of mineral ownership and tenurewhich must be simplified if development is to be encouraged on a soundtechnical basis. On the contrary, as we have already indicated, it introducesboth financial and other complications which may tend to restrict develop-ment and production.366. At the present time mineral ownership is defined by long-establishedsurface boundaries which have no relation except by accident to the shape and distribution of the mineral deposits underneath. The way in which some deposits can be worked, therefore, is determined by an artificial surfaceline and not by the shape and conditions of occurrence of the mineral. Amineral deposit, or an area containing several mineral deposits, which oughton technical grounds to be worked as a unit is often split up betweenseveral mineral owners. There are innumerable examples covering many different minerals throughout the country where a number of small mines have been opened on a deposit or on a group.of deposits where one under-taking would have been more economic and would undoubtedly have sur-vived longer than any one of the smaller mines. It is not unreasonable to suppose that had mineral rights been unified a century^ ago, whenmetalliferous mining in this country Was approaching its hey-day, and hadlarger leases then been granted, certain areas of the country where miningis extinct, or practically extinct todays would have been still operating.
The. premature, closing j Ismail; nunes - which ,haye not had the resources to -carry exploraiion further than;a,certain limited, distance from their, shafts,either laterally or in depth, has.almost certain^y/;meaht that new deposits of minerals have remained undiscovered which it.&apos;, will be.JEar,.more&apos; costly to search for today. 0Jf,;---/-.,:,-:h&apos;&apos; h t&apos;r ifew^as&apos;-C^ip^h&apos;.//367. In our,; account of nnperal resourcesj; we have indicated that, incertain mineral areas of the country jjje instaliatipn,,ofcental-treatoentplants should be considered which might serve several small mines within reasonable&apos; accbss-w^^ a plant of their owm  /&apos;.368. The treatment of large^ areas as units for exploratory purposes hasalready been mentioned as/a necessity in future .bn technical grounds ifnew resources Of certain minerals are to be discovered. There is no doubtthat at the present time one of the difficulties in encouraging private firms to embark pri schemes of this kind is that negotiations with several differentmineral owners are often involved, and that complex legal, questions arise which are not necessarily resolved by co-operative and collective action ,onthe part of mineral owners, however willing, and negotiations are inevitablytedious and costly. On&apos; the whole We believe that up tb the time of thepassing of the Town and Country Planning: Acts a large majority;; of mineral owners&apos;! would have been anxious to! co-operate, and difficuties dueto those few who might have proved to be recalcitrant could have been overcome by applying to the High Court under the Mines (Working Facilities)Acts. An : alternative P method is now avaUable-.thr;Qughi:the;.machmery of compulsory acquisition of land under the Town and Country Planning Acts,1947, add the scope of the Mines (Working Facilities) Acts: has been iextended.The real point to be made, however, is that even assuming full co-operation by mineral owners and the use, where necessary, of such compulsory powers that exist, the complexity of the procedure involved, its cost, and. the ,delaytb which it must inevitably give rise, are substantial deterrents, to the prospective mineral operator, and mineral prospecting wifl haVe little attractionin futures unless something more simple all be substitutedlm       ^. 369. Mention might be made in this connection of -the results.&apos; which followed the Petroleum ,(Prpduction) Act, 1934, when the! State acquiredownership of the rights in petroleum in the United Kingdom. The Actempowered the Minister to grant prospecting licences and to fix the con-ditions as to the size and shape of the areas in respect of which licencescould be granted, and large-scale exploratory schemes based oh the modernscientific investigation. oflarge areas were immediately started which, it is safe to assume, would not otherwise have been considered.   .jj n .370. Perhaps the most illustrative example Of a problem arising from thepresent system of mineral ownership is provided by the china clay industryin the St. Austell district of Cornwall. Reference was made in the recently published Report of the Board of Trade Working Party on china clay *to the need for the unification of mineral rights in that area. Two main reasons are given with which we are in full agreement. The first is that owing to the limited size of existing mineral leases and the large superficialarea occupied by a china-clay pit, there is often insufficient room, withinthe boundary of the lease on which to deposit waste material without, usingground under which china clay may have to. be worked at some future date- Secondly, the Report points to the need for integration of undertakingsas a matter of long-term policy in order that larger productive units canbe established Which will ensure that the remaining deposits of china claycan be worked more efficiently and to a greater depth.* Board of Trade Working Party Reports China Clay.

371. The incentive to search for and work minerals can only be restored by re-uniting the development value in minerals with the ownership. The alternative ways of doing this are that either the development value could revert to the mineral owner, wholly or in part, or the ownership (the "fee simple") as well as the development value could be acquired by the Nation. In both cases an amendment to certain provisions of the Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947, is involved.

372. We have not been able to devise a suitable amending formula whereby mineral owners could retain a sufficiently high percentage of the development value in minerals to restore incentive which would not at the same time undermine completely the general principle of the Acts. Moreover, it seems to us for technical reasons, to which we have already referred, that if the method of dealing with minerals in the Town and Country Planning Acts in future is to be amended, it should be in the direction of securing powers for some unification of mineral ownership which will facilitate the introduction of a policy to encourage the effective exploration, development, and utilisation of our mineral resources in future.

373. With regard to further compensation, if any, to be paid to the mineral owners, this should only arise in those cases where the "fee simple" ("lordship" in Scotland) could be proved to have a residual value, and providing the mineral owner had successfully claimed compensation for loss of development value under the Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947. If residual value can be proved, the amount of compensation is likely to be very small. It could be assessed as a global sum and divided on the same basis as claims admitted under Part VI of the Act in respect of loss of development value of MDC minerals.

374. Whilst our terms of reference have precluded us from making recommendations concerning other minerals of more widespread occurrence we are of the opinion that the arguments that have led us to recommend the nationalisation of mineral rights for MDC minerals are equally valid for the other minerals, which, in our view, should be dealt with in the same manner. This matter is referred to again in Chapter XI in connection with our recommendations as a whole.

CONCLUSIONS

375. In order to secure the unification of rights of those minerals covered by our Report, the development value must be reunited with the ownership. We propose that this should be effected by the transfer of the "development value" from the Central Land Board and of the "fee simple" from existing mineral owners, to a new organisation ("Mineral Development Commission") to be set up by the Minister of Fuel and Power (see chapter XI).

376. The Commission should deal with all administrative matters concerning mineral leases and, so far as possible, all official contacts between mineral operators and the Government should be centralised through it. Existing procedure will then be replaced by an ordinary arrangement as between landlord and tenant; and should the need for compulsory powers to acquire surface rights for mineral working arise, the Commission should state the case to the Ministry of Town and Country Planning.

377. The preparation of development plans covering areas containing known or suspected MDC minerals of economic importance should continue to be the responsibility of the Minister of Town and Country Planning


and of Local Planning Authorities providing that the technical information on which they are based is provided by or on behalf of the Minister of Fuel and Power.

378. The Minister of Town and Country Planning should continue to be responsible for scheduling areas and giving planning permission for the working of MDC minerals. Once the Commission is set up, permission to work, which must include not only land planning but also technical and mining considerations, should be given only by the granting of a lease.

379. The fact that (a) an area has been scheduled on development plans for mineral working and (b) the Commission is prepared to grant a lease should ensure that development permission is not withheld, but compliance with conditions of working imposed by the Local Planning Authority should remain a responsibility of the mineral lessee.

380. In order to prevent the danger of the dispersion or accidental destruction of mining records which have now lost any actual or intrinsic value to mineral owners, immediate arrangements should be made, in advance of the setting up of the Commission, for their collection, registration, or safe-guarding. This applies more particularly to records other than mine plans (for which there is already statutory provision), for instance to historical records of mining operations and to bore-hole journals. In view of the many different kinds of individuals and firms who are likely to hold such records a voluntary appeal might be the most effective.

CHAPTER IX

PRINCIPLES OF FUTURE POLICY

381. The records of mining in this country over many years have convinced us that the promotion of mineral development and of a healthy and prosperous mining industry can only be achieved through a positive long-term policy which will remove some of the uncertainties and difficulties at present facing the industry and restore incentive and confidence. This applies particularly to the need to revive exploration for minerals such as fluorspar, barytes, the non-ferrous ores and haematite. Absence of such a policy has undoubtedly been at least partly responsible for the piece-meal, hand-to-mouth type of development characteristic of certain sections of the industry in the past, with the ultimate result that mineral reserves have been lost to the Nation or mines have been closed prematurely and trained labour and technicians dispersed. More recently the effects of the absence of a long-term policy have been intensified as a result of the production needs of the War. This has meant that essential development and plant maintenance or renewal have suffered.

382. With regard to the efficient working of our known mineral deposits, or those which may be subsequently found, the Nation cannot afford to neglect to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the extent and value of the resources is determined so far as practicable, so that future production is safeguarded where necessary and proper provision made in planning schemes for mineral working.

383. Over large sections of the mineral industry today working is generally as efficient as conditions permit. Nevertheless, the Nation can no longer afford to allow any new mining operations to start, or existing operations to


continue, if the object is only &quot;to pick out the eyes-&apos;-thatis, the best1 ormost easily got mineral-to make&apos;(quiek prbfits. Premature&apos;abandonment of mines wastes reserves. The aim must be to obtain adequate knowledgeabout the mineral occurrence so that the mpst efficient and,most economicmethod of working, can be ascertained in order to make the best use of the occurrence as a whole, particularly where it containsi Ijpwer-grade pprtiphswhich would otherwise be left as upprpfitable. / :    ,,Yf&apos; 1       - .384. The principles underlying those measures which Will &quot;be necessary to overcome the difficulties and deficiencies referred to above, and to secure,&quot; thecpTordihated, orderly and ecpnorruc development&quot; of our mineral resources infuture can best,be described under the following four headings:-      f(1) Exploration and development. * :;-&apos;&apos;&quot;&apos;0&apos;&apos;\ f&apos;: ;   ^i-(2) The adequate financing and good management of mining under-takings and efficient exploitation.                              - i(3) Mineral tenure. -&quot;&apos;&apos;&apos;* :    . &apos;&apos; &apos;J(4) Strategic considerations. , ;f&apos;,&apos;; .&quot;&apos; &apos;\Exploration and Development     ,      ; .  V   .,:u385. This concerns new mineral discoveries. It thus applies more particurlarly (but not entirely) to the iode minerals and other minerals of restricteddistribution and limited quantity where the question of the continuation ofproduction after a comparatively short time is entirely dependent on newdiscoveries being made.386. The chief problem is to find a way of encouraging the search for andthe development of new mineral deposits&apos;in face of the knowledge that riskswill be greater than in the past because the better known and more accessibleresources of economic minerals are either exhausted or. are approachingexhaustion. Our accounts of the various minerals will have shown that,while the prospects of making new discoveries are by no means lacking, thefield is growing smaller; exploration in future will have to be planned onthoroughly scientific lines, and will usually haVe to be undertaken on a larger scale, over larger areas, and at greater depths: It will thus taike longer, bemore costly, and the risk therefore correspondingly greater/387. The crucial factor in considering the financing of exploration is thehigh degree of mining risk in relation to the potential profit. Generallyspeaking, and from the nature of the case, we cannot suggest any practicable steps which could be taken which would eliminate this risk from the calcula-tions of mining undertakings. While our recommendations would allow theconsideration from time to time of meeting special cases of difficulty bymeans of subsidies, we believe that this would be a wrong approach inprinciple. Similarly, it would be inappropriate to grant special taxationconcessions to the mining industry (see Chapter VII). Both these measures would tend, in the long run, to encourage a &quot; short-term &quot; outlook with too much emphasis on production.388. We have concluded, however, that there is little or no prospect of starting new exploration of the kind and on the scale needed without theinitiative and assistance of the Government in some form, and that tP achieve the best results it will be necessary to be able to discriminate so that thoseprojects can be assisted which show the best promise of leading to worthwhile discoveries. Clearly, the Government interest must be related closely to the merits of, individual cases, and in practice this must mean an interestin the establishment Of a technically sound prima facie case for exploration;
389. We have come to the conclusion, therefore, that the Government must take an active part in the discovery, delimitation and assessment of new mineral occurrence when this cannot satisfactorily, or should not, in the national interest, be undertaken by private enterprise. The main object must be to obtain preliminary information which, when made available to private enterprise, would encourage exploration or the expansion of existing operations in those places and on the scale most likely to produce successful results. This work should form the most important part of the general Government responsibility for obtaining, by means of a mineral survey, a comprehensive picture of the mineral occurrences and mineral industries as a whole (see Chapter X).

390. The acquisition of the development value in minerals from private owners through the Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947, has removed previous objections to the Government giving direct assistance for mineral development, and if mineral rights are nationalised in the manner we propose, it is entirely logical for the Government to assume responsibility for this kind of work.

391. No hard and fast lines can be laid down as to the point to which the Government should carry the quest for information ; obviously each case will vary and must be considered on its merits. Generally, the aim should be to obtain information sufficient to indicate where further exploration or even development could reasonably be started, or existing production continued with some chance of success. In some cases, however, Government responsibility for exploration must be carried far enough for a definite decision regarding the possibilities of working to be taken. By this means some part at least of the mining risk could be removed, where necessary, when the risk of the initial stage would otherwise prevent exploration or development from starting.

392. The question of the finance of Government-sponsored exploratory schemes, and of the possibility of the recovery of part or all of the cost from the profits of subsequent operations is discussed later (see Chapter XI). One principle should be that revenue obtained as royalties from the working of nationally-owned minerals should be used to foster future mineral development. Priority of examination should be given, therefore, strategic reasons apart, to those areas from which profitable results would be most likely to be obtained.

393. In the case of existing concerns where production or increased production is limited because of insufficient funds to undertake further development, it should be possible for the Government to assist in obtaining essential information by providing loans under favourable terms. The justification would be the prospect of proving sufficient reserves to encourage an undertaking to continue or increase the scale of operations.

394. Mines have had to be closed in the past and workings have become flooded because the operating company had not the necessary finance to carry on, even though the development prospects were reasonably good. In some cases this has been due to factors over which a mining concern has had no control, such as falls in world prices. In others, however, managements have clearly not resisted the temptation to curtail exploratory development in order to pay dividends, and powers should be provided to prevent this happening in future. The closure of a mine, if that would prevent or hinder access to unproved and potentially mineral-bearing ground, should not, in the national interest be countenanced in future until it has been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt, and if necessary (and under


suitable safeguards) at.

Once extraction starts, moreover; a mining company must&apos; be pre-pared for wide and sometimes violent fluctuations of the commodity: market(particularly metals see figures, pages 87-88), and unless adequate financialreserves are available it will find itself forced to concentrate on the richeror more easily mined sections of the ore-body, and to curtail expenditureon development and.exploration. K, the mine is heavily watered, pumpingis a substantial overhead cost. ]: The inevitable result, of such a,, procedure,if unduly prolonged, is the closure of. the mine and the abandonment ,qfresources which, with better financing,a might have been made available.More important, perhaps, is the fact that such failures destroy,.the.4incentiveto start new projects and tend to discredit mining in the area in whichthey occur. ..-   t - u . i\ , &apos;   .,it     , .-, i397. When considered in conjunction with mining risk the economic fae-tors which give rise to uncertainty in ordinary business have an added sighi-significance in mining. The chief of these is instability of selling prices, whichhas always been much more marked in the primary products of industry than in those nearest to consumers&apos; markets. Jn, mining, non-ferrous metalprices over the last fifty to sixty years provide an outstanding example (seefigures, pages 87-88). The highly fluctuating trends ,qf. prices and their effect on the development of such minerals as the ores of tin, tungsten,lead and zinc in the U.K. are too well known to need repetition. It is a factor which tends to increase the degree of divergence between the long-term national interest and the more immediate interest of the mining under-taking to secure profits, a divergence much more likely to occur in miningthan in other industries. Developmentsjudged to be! profitable at a givenselling price for the product, and which normally take two or three years to reach production, may be found to be uriremuherative because prices have fallen in the meantime. : Existing concerns have to cut development expenditure and work bn ahand-to-mbuth basis&apos;&apos;: without sufficient ihfdrma-tion as to what theirmineral resources, are. likely- to amount to or whatpractical difficulties of working. may, arise and haveto, toe.. circumvented.Too often in, the past, also, mining companies have not taken the dppor-tuhities, of developingahead and&apos;-modernising plant ^hen..timies have been;prosperous and funds ayaUable, so that. when economic \or, technical diffi-culties were met with the. lee-way could not be made up and prematureclosure resulted.       ].&apos;..,^&apos;&apos;t&apos;:i &apos;      j-;&apos;.&apos;-, &apos; v&apos;-; n; \ ^u\^&apos;-i&apos;:-: M &quot;i-i3.98. As in the case df encouragement for exploration, cthere !is, little that can be done to remove entirely1 the future uncertainty attaching^ tb mining&apos;operations; whether this is due to technical or&quot; econdmic causes. There&apos; isno question, however, that in certain cases, particularly new undertakings,
LEAD AND ZINCYEARLY AVERAGE OF METAL PRICES [LONDON]POUNDS STERLING

a great deal can and should be done to ensure that all reasonable precautions are taken to guard against the hazards of the future. This is particularly important when the lack of adequate precautions - for instance, insufficient exploratory information or lack of adequate finance - leads to the establishment of technically unsound developments, premature closures, and loss or misuse of resources. There have been too many instances in the past where too much money has been spent on flotation expenses and surface installations, and too little on finding out first the extent and value of the mineral deposit to be worked.

399. The foundation on which Government policy should be built up in this respect must be adequate technical information, and this can only be obtained in a large proportion of cases by systematic exploration of favourable areas selected with due regard to geological and other considerations. Once the information is available, then most questions become a matter of what is, or is not, good mining practice. In principle there should be no conflict between the desire of the Nation, having the ownership of the minerals, to secure efficient development and proper utilisation, and of private enterprise to extract the minerals at a profit. In practice, of course, it would be necessary for the Government to have powers, additional to those at present provided by the Town and Country Planning Acts, for use when necessary in the national interest to secure the ends in view, exercised directly by the Minister responsible for mineral development, through an appropriate technical organisation. Such powers must include the right to prevent the flotation of technically unsound or insufficiently financed projects, the approval of mining development plans, and the authority to secure amalgamation of undertakings or of mineral tenures or leases if desirable for technical or economic reasons. It would be necessary also in certain cases for arrangements to be possible whereby temporarily uneconomic undertakings could be maintained in production, for instance, by the provision of new plant, or by the Government contracting to purchase output at an agreed figure for a specified period. Such arrangements would normally be justified on strategic grounds, but might also be in the national interest if for any reason premature closure prejudiced future development of minerals in the immediate vicinity.

Nationalisation of Mineral Rights

400. It will be apparent that the proposals we have discussed above are hardly compatible with a continuation of the functions normally exercised by mineral owners in regard to mineral leases, or by mineral owners working their own minerals. They give added support, on the other hand, to the recommendation already made in Chapter VIII to nationalise the MDC mineral rights and vest them in an organisation responsible for the administration of all questions of mineral tenure and with the additional technical function of securing the "co-ordinated, orderly, and economic development" of minerals. The acquisition of the mineral rights, in fact if not in substance already accomplished under the Town and Country Planning Acts, should be completed, in a manner similar to that already effected in the case of petroleum (Petroleum (Production) Act, 1934) and coal (Coal Act 1938). This will secure the unification of all questions concerning mineral development under a properly qualified and largely technical organisation which will act, in effect, as a national landlord for minerals.

Strategic Considerations

401. Experience during wartime has made most nations realise that it is quite impossible to revive quickly or to increase the mineral production of industries which do not contain at least a nucleus of sound, efficient and


prosperous concerns, out of. which new developments can. grow.... When amining industry decays,1 the local ^knowledge/ and&apos; /wperience/ of; M&amp;ers&apos; goeswith it; locally, ancillary services&quot; and faculties5 are/ lostV/ all lRp  which,perhaps, could not be replaced or re-establishea&quot; Within a decade, if subsequentevents made it necessary to work mineral deposits previously &quot;thought to beuneconomic.   &apos;&apos;.///&quot;-,.&apos;&apos;&quot;&apos;//! &apos;&quot;u &apos;/&apos;:&apos;&apos;, UlU&apos;&apos;,J,f:iL &apos;-&apos; &apos; &apos;/ j&apos; :,:&apos;-:i&quot;;&apos;-:;-. rj pu.  tft**J a/.!,-. sio: .     .;5&apos; ?UO?.s1 ip o.;:-m.; -(?, Raoi Dflfi402. Similarly,-the&apos;&apos;last War proved that a great deal of valuable.timeand usually fruitless effort is wasted in conducting emergency exploratorywork in an endeavour to develop quickly resources/ of q strategic mineralsuneconomic to Work in peace-time and about the occurrences of which littleinformation is available. The records of exploration financed by the-Govern-ment in both the World Wars show how difficult it is under war conditions to resist pressure to investigate every,potential ^source of supply,-howeversmall, and; how much better and, quicker results could have been ^obtainedhad. the necessary, preliminary information been -1 available beforehand:;. / Itmust not be&apos; forgotten: in this connection that often it.may take at least two.and; perhaps three or four years, to bring to the production stage a. newmine of the size likely to contribute materially to wartime needs.?;-^     ;j; niq403. Clearly, particular, attention should be paid in peace-time to resourcesof such minerals as tungsten and tin ores, fluorspar and mica, ail1 ofwhichhad considerable strategic value during the last War. / It may even &quot;bedesirable in certain circumstances to carry the investigation up to the point at which all essential operating data, is obtained, so that when requiredproduction can be&apos; safely put in hand with the minimum of delay.CHAPTER X : 1^THE NEED FOR /TECHNICAL INFORMATION404. Our examination of the different mineral resources of the country,summarised in Chapters III and IV, has drawn attention to the fact that overthe greater part of the field which we have,,epyeredsthereis,^of the kind necessary for a proper assessment to be made of the futureimportance and economic potentialities of the resources. A/great deal of detailed information about the economics of, individual mineral occurrencesis in.the possession of private persons and firms. Some Departments, also,with wartime and present-day production responsibilities have collected acertain amount of information about particular minerals, mainly concerningproduction statistics,.and this is genexahy obtained from the industries direct.In/ some cases a small number of technical /staff of consultants are&apos; (or have been during the War) employed by such Departments to advise ohparticular questions of mineral production. We have / already referred(para. 351) to the steps being taken/by the Ministry of Town and country planning in regard to the collection of information, and (para. 335) to thefunctions of and the type of information collected by the Geological Survey.405. So far there has been no systematic attempt; on the part of theGovernment to collect technical information on a comprehensive basis, and covering the whole country, regarding such questions as,reserves of minerals,the rate of depletion, and the economic assessment of mining&apos;and develop-ment probabilities in relation to new mineral occurrences/ Ana&quot; yet this type of information should surely provide the essential foundation to any
realistic mineral development policy. Although one of the functions of the Mines Department of the Board of Trade (Mining Industry Act, 1920) was to secure the most effective development and utilisation of the mineral resources of the United Kingdom, the collection and assessment of information of this kind, a great deal of which could have been obtained from the industry and from the Geological Survey, never seems to have been attempted.

406. In some respects MDC minerals have undoubtedly suffered from lack of official attention because of their much lesser importance in comparison with coal. Nevertheless, the supplies of some MDC minerals provide the whole of our industrial requirements with, in certain cases, substantial margins for export. All are important in times of war, even when the output of some is small in relation to the total needs of the country. At the present time increased production of domestic mineral raw materials represents import savings, in many cases from hard currency areas, this is particularly true of the non-ferrous metal ores and haematite.

407. In both the World Wars demands have suddenly arisen for increased production or new production of certain minerals which it has been impossible to meet in the time available because of the lack of information or of the necessary preparatory work. Such demands should be foreseen and all appropriate measures taken in advance so far as is reasonable and practicable.

408. In this country operations over many years have largely exhausted the more accessible deposits of some of the minerals of more restricted distribution to the point at which proved reserves amount to only a few more years&apos; supply. The chief minerals in this category are the non-ferrous ores, haematite iron ore, fluorspar, barytes and witherite. These are the minerals where strategic considerations sometimes become important. It is true that geological information suggests that in certain places new deposits may be found, but present information is totally inadequate for estimates to be made of the future contribution to the country&apos;s need which might be made by mineral deposits of this kind.

409. With regard to minerals such as salt, gypsum and anhydrite, china clay, ball clays and fullers&apos; earth, while in general large reserves have been proved, the need for additional information about the limits of deposits and their variations beyond the boundaries of existing undertakings is becoming essential. This is because the absence of any cause for anxiety about reserves, even if we look as far ahead as, say, fifty years, is contingent on working being efficient, properly planned and co-ordinated with other industrial developments and land uses.

410. Output has increased so much in recent years that, in spite of still considerable 

reserves, the effects of the rate of extraction on the future working of these minerals must be a matter of national concern and should no longer be ignored. Badly sited or inefficient workings of these minerals during the next few years, or planning decisions taken without the essential information about the available resources, could easily result in important parts of future reserves being sterilised for all time or rendered more costly to extract. The chief way in which bad planning can be avoided is by obtaining sufficient information about the distribution and nature of the deposits as a whole so that workings can be planned in relation to the shape and extent of the mineral occurrences and the economic size of the individual undertakings determined irrespective of any limitations imposed by the artificial surface boundaries of mineral ownership.

411. Generally speaking, within this group of minerals, the need is for more knowledge about the extensions of existing deposits. Nevertheless, the possibility of making new discoveries must not be overlooked. The


recent, discovery of potash minerals and salt in N.E. Yorkshire .(page, 44)is a case in point and, taken in Conjunction with geological evidence hotyet confirmed by boring, suggests&quot; that the possibilities. Of discovering othernew importaht/deposits, of minerals of this kind in different parts of /thecountry musi hot be pyerlbOkedV&apos; Similarly in the case&quot; of china * clay,: areas are known where hew &quot;deposits may be.&apos; found but which have not yet been properly explored. Although the industry already has substantial reserves,the prospect of disclosing better quality - deposits or deposits which ; are ^easier tO work, must nOt be disregarded/ ?y   &apos;      ^; - / -:ir&apos;&apos;-&apos; .!,?::v&apos;&apos;    ^Low-grade and Marginal Mineral: Deposits uii&amp;m412. A great deal more preliminary information is necessary in regardtb another class of miherai deposits^ that of the&apos; lOw-^grade ores and^ other ^mineral deposits which are not at present economic. It has been.&apos; saidthat the waste of yesterday frequently becomes the -&quot;sub-marginal reserve of today and the ore of tomorrow; innumerable examples can be given inillustration of this, several from our own country. Similarly, new,uses havebeen found for mineral products Which have revolutionised previous ideasabout mineral, economics; new methods of Working or of treatment -havebeen developed which have turned useless deposits into valuable minerals.The form in which the mineral deposit is found is sometimes more impor-tant than the tonnage or the grade. Above all variations in market prices and in industrial demands are constantly changing our conception of whatis or is not worth working. .&apos;,&apos;.&apos;...,&apos;./. ...413. Information of this character was occasionally sought&apos;by mineralowners who Were anxious to have their minerals worked; necessarily, how-ever, it was limited to the narrow confines of individual mineral ownerships.To sOme extent also, the collection and publication of data of this&quot; kind forms part of the work of the Geological Survey. What is required in futureis the comprehensive assessment of all data available from the economicstandpoint, and the initiation of further exploration and research into prob-lems of mineral dressing and processing, so that new development Can be encouraged if and when justified, or full information about the conditions under which the working of low-grade or marginal deposits would becomeeconomic is obtained and made ready for use at the appropriate time. ,Inthe British Commonwealth countries and in the U.S.A. research work onlow-grade ores and minerals is an important function of the GovernmentDepartments responsible for mining. hi414. In this connection the strategic factor may be&apos; of considerable im-portance. Past experience has shown that in an emergency there is hptime to start collecting data, let alone to carry out all the preliminary worknecessary to set in train mining operations which can produce a significant contribution to national needs in a short time. On this account alone therewould seem to us to be a Strong case for1 the proper and systematic investi-gation of some of the. occurrences of certain minerals of possible strategicbut not at present economic importance, even when only small tonnagesare available relative to national needs as a whole. Obvious examples of minerals in this category are wolfram, tin ore, mica, felspar and fluorspar. :415. It is impracticable for the Government to attempt to exercise ppsirtive functions in regard tomineraldevelopment which would have any lastring value without.at the same time providing the means whereby reliableand essential information can be made available. We therefore recbmmendthe establishment forthwith pf a mineral resources survey as an essentialfunction of the new mineral development organisation already proposed.
One of the objects would be to carry the work of the Geological Survey in the mineral field a stage further, and where justified to test geological conclusions from the economic standpoint. Another would be to provide adequate information for the planning and conduct of new exploration schemes. This should apply not only to large-scale, Government-sponsored exploration, but also to prospecting generally. The chances of important discoveries being made by the old-time type of individual prospector with limited funds are fast disappearing in this country, if they have not already long since passed in many districts. Nevertheless there are still places where prospecting in a small way may prove to be of great value. A mineral survey should assist in defining such places, and by providing information, encourage the genuine prospector and stimulate his enterprise by advice and assistance based on up-to-date technical knowledge.

The Meaning of a Mineral Resources Survey

4l6. Comprehensive information about mineral resources can be broadly described as covering quantitative and qualitative information of resources or potential resources together with such knowledge of their distribution and of other technical considerations necessary to encourage future development and enable it to follow a profitable, efficient, and properly-organised plan.

417. In regard to a particular mineral area or mineral occurrence a survey to obtain sufficient information to decide whether economic operations were possible would normally be split up into three stages. In some cases the first would indicate that no further work was justified; in others Government interest might be extended to the completion of the second stage, or even the third, if necessary, to obtain sufficient information to enable private enterprise either to complete the exploration or to commence development or production.

418. The first stage is the examination of geological evidence. This would normally provide information about the situation, structure, mode of occurrence and mineralogical composition of mineral deposits, together with such geological conclusions, as can be drawn about their relationship to the rocks in which they are found, their extent, variability and other matters which might affect the economics of their extraction. Where mineral deposits were not proved but only suspected then the evidence would deal mainly with those geological factors, favourable and unfavourable, on which information had to be obtained and correlated with adjacent or neighbouring known deposits. A great deal of information of this kind about most of our mineral deposits and the mineral districts of the country has already been collected and examined by the Geological Survey and has been published, or is available for reference.

419. The second stage is the direct application of geological conclusions to mining possibilities. It involves the detailed and comprehensive study of all the mining data available from old workings, plans and other records, so that the information can be assessed and a plan of further exploration prepared.

420. The third stage covers actual prospecting and exploration which may include geophysical, work, boring, shaft sinking, driving tunnels, sampling, testing and other kindred matters. It is work which covers the field of many experts and specialists, chiefly, of course, that of the mining engineer. At every stage, full liaison would have to be maintained with the Geological Survey so that new geological information obtained in the work could be used to the best advantage.


421. A comprehensive survey of resources, such as we propose above, could not expect to reach finality. It would be a continuing process, subject to review from time to time, because one of the unavoidable difficulties of certain types of mining is that full details about a particular mineral deposit are obtained only as working proceeds and uncertainties may continue until the deposit is worked out. Conclusions built up from details available about individual mineral workings, therefore, would have to be applied to mineral districts as a whole, so that where need be steps could be taken to obtain further information where important gaps in the overall picture remained to be filled. It will be obvious that the task is one on which private enterprise and the Government would have to co-operate, since some of the information would have to be supplied by individual mineral undertakings.

Confidential Information

422. In the past, when conditions were highly competitive, mining companies were generally reluctant to disclose information about ore reserves and other matters concerning the properties they controlled. In recent years, however, particularly with companies operating abroad, the position has substantially changed and it is now the exception rather than the rule for companies to withhold information about development results and ore reserves, particulars of which are usually given in their annual reports. In this country there are still instances of both large and small mining concerns who do not willingly disclose information of this kind for publication.

423. The Geological Survey can require geological information about mineral deposits to be disclosed by mining companies, but, if requested, such information has to be kept confidential and used only to assist in drawing general geological conclusions.

424. It would seem to us that in future it will be completely illogical for any information of the kind required in connection with a mineral survey not to be made readily available and, if necessary, published. It should be possible to devise a suitable arrangement whereby details about mineral deposits and their working which may affect the interests of any particular firm could be made available on a confidential basis and not disclosed. We believe, however, that generally in future such a necessity for non-disclosure should be a rare occurrence; it should be avoided whenever possible.

Official Statistics

425. We have noted that when publication of mineral production statistics was resumed by the Ministry of Fuel and Power after the War, it was in a much more condensed form than was the practice by the Mines Department prior to 1939. In our opinion this is a retrograde step. We consider that if the publication of statistics is to have any real value to the mining industry under present conditions, more detailed information is required to be given. This should be a matter for the Commission but it should be examined irrespective of whether or not our recommendation for the setting up of the Commission is adopted.

CHAPTER XI

THE FUTURE ORGANISATION OF MINERAL DEVELOPMENT

426. Although the various functions and duties we have described as being necessary for the Government to assume in regard to mineral development are both technical and administrative in character, the background is


essentially technical, so that applied and specialist knowledge and experience must provide the basis of any permanent arrangements made.

427. The need for the whole of the work to be centralised under one permanent organisation, properly constituted, with the requisite staff, and with specific aims and functions, is overwhelming. Each of the steps we have proposed are inter-dependent, and form an integral part of a unified and positive policy. It would not be practicable, in our view, otherwise to secure the proper co-ordination of effort throughout the various mineral industries we have examined; neither could adequate technical direction and efficiency be achieved if the responsibilities were divided between different Departments.

428. The specialised nature of work of this kind has long been recognised in the British Dominions and other countries abroad where mineral industries of national importance are in existence, and central organisations essentially similar to that we are proposing have long been established. The constitution and functions of the various organisations naturally differ considerably in detail, but the principle of general responsibility for looking after the country&apos;s mineral raw materials, securing their best use, and fostering their development is common throughout. The relevant sections of the United States Bureau of Mines may perhaps be regarded as an example of the type of organisation we have in mind, although the size and importance of the mineral industries of the U.S.A. (the Bureau covers all minerals and mineral substances, including coal and petroleum, and has other functions, e.g., health and safety responsibility) far exceeds that of the minerals with which we are concerned in this Report, and any arrangements in this country must be on a correspondingly smaller scale.

429. The fact that the proposed organisation will own the mineral resources of the country on behalf of the State, and the general nature of its duties both suggest that it could perform its task better as a properly constituted Commission with appropriate powers, rather than as part of, and from within, a Government Department. The functions of the "Coal Commission", set up under the Coal Act, 1938, to acquire and manage the property and rights in unworked coal and mines of coal, and of the Forestry Commission, both concerned with the conservation and development of natural raw materials, indicate that a constitution on somewhat similar lines is required. The analogy with the "Coal Commission", with extended functions in certain respects, is perhaps the closer, but as this body is no longer in existence, the Forestry Commission is now the nearest parallel.

430. From the administrative point of view the Commission cannot operate satisfactorily unless it is responsible to a single Minister, and having considered possible alternatives we have come to the conclusion that the present statutory position should be maintained and that the Minister should be the Minister of Fuel and Power. The Minister should be specifically answerable in Parliament for the Commission for laying down the broad lines of the policy to be pursued and, among other things, for the appointment and conditions of service of its members.

431. We have reached these conclusions in full knowledge that if accepted they will involve an adjustment of present Government administrative arrangements due to the division between different Departments of statutory responsibilities for mineral production on the one hand and end use control on the other, while responsibility for mineral development, as set out in the Ministry of Fuel and Power Act, 1945, rests with the Minister of Fuel and Power. Without giving some consideration to these matters, it


is not possible to set out clearlypur ideas of how&quot;the Commission should work, and our obser v ations and conclusions i^^y^^^^^V-&apos;^&quot;^^^convenient, however, first to set out the constitution and functions of&apos; jtheCommission.  . ;: ;: &apos;;] &apos;Vu      &apos; &apos;Z^.&quot; J^&apos;J432. Our proposals may be summarised as follows:  &apos; -   j &apos;    -u  i w.-(i) The Minister should establish a new organisation&apos; responsible tohim on matters of policy, but with certain specific executive powers,&apos;to be known as the &quot; Mineral Development Commission&quot;, the&quot; con-.&apos;   stitutiph of which shouldV.h:e ;oh kihtflar^JmeV-to ^nfcf of the Cosd; Commission (see Coal Act; 1938).   r -     &apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;     ff,. ;;&apos;n:^&apos;:&apos;.;&quot;(ii) The ownership (&quot; fee simple&quot;) in certain specified minerals shouldbe acquired, and together with the&quot;&quot; development value &quot; hi-thesame minerals (at present vested in the Central Land Board) shouldbe transferred to the new Commission; !-&apos;433. The chief functions of the Mineral Development Commission should(a) General responsibihty: for the management of the property rights inminerals on behalf of the Nation, for fostering, mrneral discoverydevelopment, efficient working and research.(b) Establishment and operation of a national mineral resources sur-vey. This should include the preparation of comprehensive and up-to-date mining maps,, reports and estimates relating to knownor potential mineral occurrences and to mineral reserves.(c) Subject to the consent of the Minister, the fixing of conditions ofworking in respect of existing leases where this is deemed to benecessary in the national interest.      , &apos;-&quot;&apos;-&quot;.(d) Administration and supervision of all matters concerning mineralleases. This should include the grantingofprospecting licences andleases over such areas, and under such conditions, financial or other-wise, as may, be deemed expedient, provided that the area concernedhas been scheduled by Local Planning Authorities.for mineral work-ing and development permission has beenpbtained.;, -Z]/.&apos;i(e) Extension of the mineral survey where necessary to include explora-tion to obtain information essential for a; proper&apos;assessment of mineral resources and their efficient development, or to encouragenew or expanded mining operations.

(i) Setting up of appropriate organisations, with the approval of the Minister, to operate mineral projects where this expedient in the national interest.

(j) To make recommendations to the Minister in those cases where the Commission considers that the amalgamation of undertakings is necessary in order to secure the most economic or most efficient development of mineral resources.

Relationship to other Departments

434. With regard to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the relationship of the proposed Commission is clear, whether it is direct, or through the Minister responsible for mineral development. First, and most important, the Commission will need to maintain the closest possible relationship with the Geological Survey &amp; Museum (D.S.I.R.) since it will rely on that Institution mainly for the provision of fundamental geological data, not only in the early stages of the mineral survey, but continually as the work proceeds. One of the deficiencies of national policy in the past has been that there has been no means of carrying the work of the Geological Survey in the mineral field beyond the stage of geological deductions, or of testing its possible economic, as distinct from scientific, importance.

435. Secondly, on the question of research generally, the Commission should in all cases examine with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research the possibility of using or extending existing research facilities, whether within that Department or outside, to cover investigations into any particular mining or mineral development problems. It should be noted here, however, that the research problems of the Commission will often be directly related to investigations in the field, and that almost certainly the Commission will need to be equipped with some research facilities of a specialised kind under its own control.

436. Relationship with, the Ministry of Town and Country Planning has already been discussed (see Chapter VIII). The position may be summarised by saying that development plans, where they must include provision for existing or potential mineral workings, should be prepared or amended after information has been supplied by the Commission, as distinct from Production Departments as at present (see below). The scheduling of an area for mineral working should normally imply that development permission will not be withheld providing that the Commission is prepared to grant new prospecting licences or leases, or to confirm or renew existing leases. If conditions of working fixed by Local Planning Authorities to development permissions are contested, either by the mineral undertaking or by the Commission, the Minister of Town and Country Planning should consult with the Minister of Fuel and Power, who would then act in the same capacity as existing Production Departments for this purpose.

437. We have already referred (para. 351) to the steps which are at present being taken by the Ministry of Town and Country Planning to secure information about mineral undertakings and mineral occurrences for the purposes of exercising their responsibilities in connection with the mineral workings provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947.

438. In, our opinion some at least, if not all, of the functions of that Ministry in respect of obtaining technical information about MDC mineral deposits should be assumed by the Commission, as they are logically part


of the responsibilities tq be assigned, to, itand would cpme naturally withinthe ambit of the proposed comprehensive survey of resources.;. A greatproportion of the information obtained is a result ;pf&apos;.. the ftr,e^W arranger ^ments of the Ministry of Town and Country Planning bah1 only&apos; come direct from me industry, whereas1 the Commission will have more specific and positive duties and powers in^ respect1 of exploration, testing-and research, to supplement existing knowledge because of production needsi -This is in itselfan indication that our recommendations are likely to lead ffiOte usefuland fundamental results from the long-term point of view. There can beno question that a mineral survey will aBJ^Sr.^Brafe. %ift^?--1^fii?^tf5iltebcountry unless it is comprehensive in the sense described: in jShaptef X, and clearly this must be the responsibility Of a technical l body; properly con-stituted for the purpose. Close. liaison between: the Commission and theMinistry of Town and Country Planning will be essential,, but; so far aspossible; the work to be undertaken by the Commission should replace any independent departmental arrangements now in existence,?:and departments should rely upon the. Commission for all-technical advice and;information.439. The^Conhnission should ai&apos;so work in&apos; coliabpfiitibh with the CentralLand Board on any. question where the use of land for mineral workingmake it desirable that agreement should be reached between these two bodies.Government administrative arrangements -a.-::i^\I 440. The proposed responsibilities of the Minister of: Fuel and power,exercisable through the Commission, and those of Departments with functions in regard to mineral/production are not easy to reconcile. For One thing,it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, toodraw; a satisfactory\hlinebetween one set of responsibilities and the other. Furthermore, the divisionof responsibility as at present is bound, to impede the work:of the-Gom-mission. Production ^responsibility arose out of wartime needs /when lit was essential to relate home production closely to &quot;end-use&quot; requirements andto strike a practicable balance with imports. The wartime arrangements are continuing, in principle unchanged, due to the necessities of a con-trolled economy, but they may perhaps be expected gradually to diminishin degree of application, especially in the case Of, say, the Hon-ferrous metalores (Ministry of Supply) where home production is small.441. We understand that at the moment the duties of production authori-ties, while necessarily variable in detail according&quot; to the; particular circumstances-stances of each industry, are in general; concerned with,the allocation ofraw. materials, for instance, sted/and^bmldihgmaterialsrand me preparationof investment programmes. In the case of the Board of Trade,, exportconsiderations are also included in respect of china clay, ball, clays, salt, andfullers&apos; earth. 7:,       ,&apos;   7-V,.,,;&apos;7&apos;&apos;.V;- ;&apos;.-:.&apos;7442. It will be obvious that responsibilities of this kind; which havejustifiably to be related mainly to present-day or relatively short-term con-siderations, must inevitably conflict sooner or later with development questionsof a long-term character. Equally obvious is the fact that it would be im-practicable for the Commission to perform the,functions we have describedwithout it becoming directly interested in production. The natural solution,bearing in mind that the direct and day-to-day responsibilities of prO-duction authorities in relation to individual mihiq^ firms may be expected in the normal course of events to: decrease rather than&apos;increase, wouldbe to transfer production responsibility wholly to the Minister of Fuel and power, who is already responsible for coal, which amounts to 87 per cent,of the country&apos;s mineral mdustry.   This would be clean-cut.   It would
have the great advantage of setting up one channel between the industry and the Government. One Department only would be concerned, instead of several at the moment. In practice, moreover, it is comparatively easy thus to draw the limit of production responsibility at the point at which the mineral product is ready for sale at the mine. An obvious analogy at the present time seems to us to be the relationship between the Ministries of Food, and Agriculture and Fisheries.

443. Such an arrangement need not in our view prejudice the special responsibilities of Departments for procuring adequate supplies of mineral raw materials to meet end uses, which would continue unchanged. Having regard to the relatively small size of the MDC mineral industries concerned, the amount of duplication of effort, if any, between the "user" ministry on the one hand, and the Ministry of Fuel and Power on the other, particularly when the latter is already responsible for similar "production" questions in respect of coal, would be amply compensated for by the centralisation of all mineral questions, with their natural technical background, under one authority. We have not attempted to examine the details of this proposed transfer of responsibilities but the arrangements might include the following:-

(i) Production and development policy to be agreed between the Ministers concerned, for a long period ahead, preferably at least five years. If possible it should include maximum and minimum production targets.

(ii) In setting policy, the Ministers should take account of the need for agreement regarding strategic development questions, and of any necessity temporarily to assist financially uneconomic production, the maintenance of which was necessary to safeguard or assist future production and development, or to insure against sterilisation of resources.

(iii) Within the agreed policy the Commission should be given the additional responsibility of acting as the "production authority" and dealing with such day-to-day matters as this involves.

(iv) For applications for steel, building materials and licences, the Commission should act as sponsor and should transmit applications, with the necessary technical advice, to the Minister of Fuel and Power, or through him to the Department concerned.

Organisation of the Commission - England and Wales

444. For the purposes of its own work and to assist in liaison with Local Planning Authorities, the Central Land Board, and Officers of the Geological Survey and Museum, the Commission will have to set up regional offices at an early stage. This is particularly necessary in order that it can at once establish contact with offices of existing mineral owners so that records of mineral properties can be transferred and other arrangements completed. Even as things stand at present under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, the removal of incentive from mineral owners, consequent upon the acquisition of development value in minerals, may result in the destruction of valuable records in certain cases unless immediate steps are taken to prevent it.

445. The need for the establishment of regional offices does not necessarily imply that a large permanent organisation is needed. One difficulty, of course, is the scattered nature of the industries concerned. While we have


not attempted detailed,estimates,, we believe that administratively the work would not be large, and that three pr four regional bffiees; each whh^a staff of three or four, might meet the demands Of England and Wales.446. The size of the permanent technical staff is m6st difficult to estimate,and could only be determined after a full examination&apos; of policy by-allconcerned. It should not be large; although initially the work would be heavy. - &apos;      &quot;       &apos;--Ji-&apos;-^-&apos;:Z/&apos;447. One of the first tasks of the Commission should be to plan the exploration and; approve reasbhable ^proposals relatirijl5 to the - proper de-velopment of the new; discovery of potash in Yorkshire-(page 44). Anotherwould be to arrange for the transfer of mining records from mineral owners.Organisation of the Commission-Scotland448. The Commission should have a separate organisation;in Scotland,which, while it formed part of the Commission as a whole, should.be directly responsible to the Secretary of State in his capacity as Minister for theeconomic development of Scotland. For instance, provision will have tobe made for the special requirements of Scotland as regards the develop-ment of its scattered and generally small resources as part of a generalrehabilitation policy. This applies particularly to the Highlands and islands where it will undoubtedly be necessary to attempt to integrate somemineral development projects, perhaps only of small size, with other develop-ment schemes for specific.areas, as a matter of general policy of the Secretaryof State designed to arrest depopulation. , ...; &apos; ^     &apos;449. A precedent for an administrative&apos; arrangement Of this kind isprovided by the Forestry Commission. ;     7. 7 ^450. The duties of the Commission in Scotland would be similar to those for England and Wales. Specially important, however, would be the duty to secure the provision of research facilities to investigate the possibilityof processing, or raising the grade of certain minerals of which large ton-nages exist but which at present cannot be worked economically. We have in mind especially diatoniite, felspar, talc and olivihe. Th this connectionour attention has been drawn to existing facilities which might1 be more fullyused at Scottish Universities and Technical Colleges who would be willingto consider giving active assistance in such matters. The commission should also maintain close liaison, as in England and Wales, with the geological Survey and Museum (Scottish Office), and with the Scottish Council (Development and Industry).Financial Arrangements451. The functions which we have assigned to the Commission will neces-sitate the expenditure of considerable sums, particularly during the first few years of its existence, oh exploratory work undertaken as part of the mineral survey. While the objective in view should always be to secureresults in the form of specific information about the existence of mineral resources of economic importance which will ultimately prove to be a source of revenue, the Commission will obviously have to risk expenditure from time to time on many projects which will produce negative results.It is generally recognised that in mmeral exploratiqn successes,-though oftenhighly profitable when achieved, are far outnumbered by failures. Theextent to which the Commission should risk capital, expenditure of this
kind is a matter which falls largely outside our terms of reference,although &apos;our technical: enquiry prompts; us; to, put forward&apos; the following generalcomments:^      ; .!; tiiiv/ lodj^corporation ,bnE ,g:sbj3 sin      birilpp: s .sd^(a) Urgent and&apos; in some cases strategic, national considerations willdemand the acceptance of a higher degree&quot; of risk by the Commissionin endeavouring to extend vthe..apparently iimited iife^oJ.vjnjnej!alresources such as tin, and tungsten ores,, fluorspar ^:-/-?-&apos;-!

The^Commission; must\-.nbt,necessarily be expected to become entirelyself-supporting out of revenue it: receives from:royalties;. The financing of the work it wiil be required to do could not have been borne by mineralowners out of royalty receipts and the rates of the latter must obviously notbe increased. ; The Commission will have failed in its task of promoting the national interest in mineral development, therefore, if the scope of workjustified on technical grounds is limited by financial considerations of thiskind. !::V-.f, y .vW&apos;\c;-e, \y-i-&apos;&apos;:\. mvi&apos;2&apos;&apos; &apos; 453. We recommend, therefore, that as soon as the Commission is con-stituted the Treasury should make an advance to it of a sum in accord with general economic considerations, ; and within the national investment programme. The Commission should prepare an Annual Report and accounts to be submitted to the Minister of Fuel and Power who shouldlay them before both Houses of Parliament. The financial arrangements ofthe Commission should be reviewed before the first five years of its existencehave elapsed.   -      m\ jo? - :.;  &apos;od -CHAPTER XIISUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.

Unless our recommendation for the nationalisation of mineral rights (above) is to be implemented in a very short time, the mineral rights in specified potash-bearing minerals should be nationalised seperately, in the same manner as petroleum minral rights under the Petroleum (Production) Act, 1934.

APPENDIX II

MINERAL DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE REPORT

Reservations by Mr. Peter Thorneycroft, M.P.

1. I disagree with what I take to be the two main conclusions reached by my colleagues - namely:-

(a) To nationalise the minerals included in their terms of reference.

(b) To establish a Mineral Development Commission to which the fee simple in these materials would be transferred.

I wish to state shortly the reasons for my disagreement and the alternative proposals I would put forward.

2. The weight of evidence which has been given before the Committee has certainly been to the effect that the Town and Country Planning Act is, insofar as it applies to minerals, unworkable. In such circumstances there are three courses open - namely:- to nationalise the minerals; to amend the Town and Country Planning Act, or to remove minerals from the Act altogether. I deal with these different courses below.

To nationalise the Minerals.

3. This course is the one preferred by my colleagues. They appear to agree that in practice a decision to nationalise the minerals actually within their terms of reference would lead to a decision to nationalise other minerals of more common occurrence. At the start of our enquiry I was inclined to the view that the nationalisation of these minerals might possibly provide the answer to some part of our problem. The more I attended our Committee meetings and listened to the evidence, the more satisfied I became that nationalisation, at least in the form recommended by my colleagues, would increase rather than diminish the problems of mineral development.

The arguments in favour of nationalisation are that it would bring the ownership of the minerals and the right to develop them into the same hands. It would, of course, leave the land and the minerals in separate ownership unless and until someone came along and suggested that it would be administratively convenient to assimilate those two. All incentive would be taken from the landowner to explore or encourage others to explore the minerals on his property or to encourage the development of those minerals in any way. Indeed, the incentive would be negative one - i.e. he would be actively concerned to preserve the amenities of his property by discouraging exploitation on his land. A new and probably expensive Mineral Development Commission would be established which would be yet another Board to which application would have to be made before private exploration or development could take place.

To amend the Town and Country Planning Act.

4. I understand that the possibility of such amendment is or has been under consideration. It might be possible to amend the Act so as to restore some part of the incentive to the owner to sell and the prospector to explore. Presumably any amendment along these lines would be upon the basis of the State purchasing part of the development right only and allowing the remainder to be dealt with upon a market value basis. I doubt whether any amendment of this kind would really work.

It would certainly raise complex problems as to the amount of compensation mineral owners should receive for their existing development rights under present legislation. In any event, it could not get over the difficulty that insofar as you take away development rights, you take away incentive also.

To take the Minerals with which we are concerned out of the Town and Country Planning Act.

5. This would restore incentive to both the owner and the prospector. The argument, and indeed the only argument which I have heard advanced against this course is the difficulty which may have arisen in the past where mineral ownership is divided into a number of different hands thus complicating the problem of large-scale development. No evidence has been given to the Committee - although I have asked for any that was available - to suggest that any such obstacle is holding up development at the present time. Indeed, such evidence as we have had is all the other way.

New Organisation.

6. I see no purpose in establishing a new Mineral Development Commission. The responsibility for the development of these minerals was placed upon the Minister of Fuel and Power by the Act of 1945. He should discharge that responsibility and not pass it to another body. I think he might well consider strengthening and expanding


the section dealing with this particular type of work, but he should keep the responsibility for seeing that it is carried out firmly in his own hands and be answerable directly to Parliament for what is done.

The establishment of a Mineral Development Commission which would admittedly have to be upon a Regional as well as on a National basis would certainly be a costly undertaking. The cost of exploratory work upon the scale contemplated by my colleagues would be, to say the least, considerable. I am not impressed by the argument that this work is too speculative for private enterprise and therefore should be undertaken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. If I were Chancellor of the Exchequer I would think a long time before using public funds in a gamble of this character. I also bear in mind the possibility that some industrial interests and land-owners would be quite happy to watch the Government do the exploration at the public expense rather than spend their own money.

I hold the view that the best explorers are often the industrial concerns themselves. They know what it is that they are looking for.

7. In these circumstances it seems to me that a solution should be sought along the lines set out below. It will be seen that I draw no doctrinaire distinction between private and public ownership but seek to combine the advantages of large-scale development in certain areas with the advantages of continued initiative and exploration by private people over the country as a whole. My solution would be as follows:-

(a) Remove all minerals from the compensation and betterment provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act. The ownership of the mineral and the right to develop it would both remain in the same private hands.

(b) The effect of removing minerals from the Town and Country Planning Act in the sense described above would be to leave the Minister of Town and Country Planning with the power to permit or refuse permission to develop but to deprive a private owner who had been refused permission to develop of any right to compensation. This may seem harsh on private owners. I would, however, point out:-

(i) that they will probably get little under the existing provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act.

(ii) No Minister is likely to refuse permission to develop valuable mineral deposits if he can possibly avoid doing so.

(iii) It has been suggested to us in evidence that it may be possible in the case of some minerals for the owners to arrange a compensation scheme among themselves.

(iv) In the event of his mineral being worked he will get a fair price for it.

(c) In cases where development is clearly desirable (Yorkshire Potash would be an example) and difficulty arises owing to the separate ownership of the minerals, steps should be taken to ensure development. The prospective developer could put forward a scheme to the Minister for development of the area as a unit, and the Minister should be empowered after full public enquiry at which all interested parties could give public evidence, to take over the mineral concerned at a price and on such conditions as appeared just. This seems to me a practical form of nationalisation. It requires a case to be proved and is done for a specific purpose. It can proceed at such a pace as the economic condition of the country and the resources and activities of industrial enterprises permit. Above all, it can proceed while at the same time not hindering prospecting work by private individuals over other minerals and in other areas. 

8. I conclude that it is possible to further mineral exploration and development in the United Kingdom by reducing the general level of taxation and the removal of the complex administrative barriers which at present hamper and restrict it. I would, however, advise any Government (particularly in existing economic circumstances) to think well before it ventures public funds upon so hazardous and speculative a form of enterprise.
