CU9) 179 COPY NOIph AUGUST, 191+9CABINETSTERLING BALANCES OF THE STERLING AREANote by the President of the Board of TradeI circulate, for consideration by my colleagues, amemorandum prepared in the Treasury on the problem of the sterling balances of the sterling area.     This question is certain to beraised in the forthcoming Washington talks, and I recommend mycolleagues to endorse the policy put forward by the Treasury.H. W.ard of Trade, S.W. 1,2J+TH AUGUST, 19^-9.STERLING BALANCES OF THE STERLING area memorandum by the treasury under Section 10 of the Anglo-American financial agreement of December, 19h53 the text of which is reproduced as annex *A&apos; to this memorandum, we undertook to seek settlementson certain lines with holders of sterling balances, and inparticular with the sterling area countries, so as to provide some adjustment of those balances, i.e. partial cancellation.We may expect that this general subject will be raised in theforthcoming Washington discussions.     Our general reply must bethat Section 10 bound us to attempt to make every endeavour tosecure settlements by agreement.     While we have failed to reachsuch agreement with anybody (except that Australia and New &apos;-Zealand have made gifts to us), we have not given up our rightto reopen the question in future.      The various agreements whichhave been made are interim in character without prejudice tothis particular issue.     While, therefore, we cannot be accused of being in default under Section 10, we certainly cannot claim,that we have achieved the objects set out in it.     Above all, weshould not say that we have abandoned all hope.2. Recent conversations with H. M. Ambassador in Washingtonsuggest that it is not impossible that these talks might lead toconstructive suggestions for the future in which the UnitedStates, the holders of the sterling balances and ourselves might reach an overall settlement jvhich would make a substantial con-tribution to the success of the talks, which would be very greatly helped by a step which would remove one of the greatburdens to the security of the future stability of sterling.The following paragraphs therefore deal v/ith certain suggestions which have been canvassed from time to time, that the UnitedStates might be persuaded in suitable conditions to take over a liability to meet part of the sterling balances in dollarsagainst a cancellation of a further part by the present holders.

This idea, which may be susceptible of many variations, has suchadvantages that in spite of difficulties which we feel bound toset out, the efforts involved are well worth making.3. It is obvious:-(a) that the United States would expect a very considerablecorresponding sacrifice from the existing holders of sterling balances.     But the sacrifice could not extend over the whole area of the balances since the external assets of the countries concerned are, tosome extent, backing for their currency:    it would therefore be necessary to exclude from any settlement by way of cancellation a reasonable amount to be used as a currency reserve and to provide in some way thatthese amounts could not be used to recreate theproblem we are now trying to solve.(b) Whether or not their balances are arbitrarily reduced,it must be assumed that the external assets of the holders would continue to fall, i. e. they are likelyto continue to run a deficit as long as they can afford to do so.     There must, however, come a time at which they would in any case have to stop runninga deficit:    a whole new set of problems would arise if the effect of the scheme were substantially to advance that time or to reduce the currency backingbelow danger point.&apos;(c) The swollen volume of United Kingdom trade with thecountries concerned and the employment dependent upon it would certainly fall.     This is a necessary con-dition of increasing exports to more desirable marketsbut a sudden stop would cause great dislocation and consequent unemployment.     Provided that a settlement is based on tapering off, as were the recent agree-ments with India and Pakistan, the adjustment for united Kingdom industry should and must be manageable.4. Taking first the United States attitude, this will nodoubt reflect the philosophy which led to Section 10 of theFinancial Agreement of December, 1945.     This had its originpartly in the feeling that, had Lend/Lease principles been extended over the whole of the sterling area, the great bulk ofthe sterling balances would never have arisen, and partly in thequite genuine feeling that a substantial alleviation was essentia3to. United Kingdom recovery.     Equally the Americans feared that,as indeed has happened, the easy spending power in sterling flowinfrom the existence of these huge balances would lead to great advantages for British exports to the countries concerned, at atime when dollar shortages would be restricting the field for american exports and so enabling us to establish ourselves more to their detriment.     We can only guess what they would now think;but it is reasonable to suppose that they would expect any dollarsplaced by them at the disposal of holders of sterling balances to result in a diminution of the sterling balances by at least twice the equivalent of the dollars to secure an equivalent sacrifice(i. e.  cancellation of  2 in exchange for  1 worth of dollars).Since they could not deal-with the whole of the balances in thisway, there would be a volume of sterling balances still remaining in the treatment of which they would demand a. considerable say.It is almost certain that they would expect the holders and theUnited Kingdom to agree upon schedules of releases of the remaininsterling balances and might seek to add the proviso that amountsso released (possibly together with current sterling earnings)should be available in whole or in part for spending in anycurrency area.      Finally, the amount of dollars made available forthe scheme would undoubtedly be strictly limited by Congress.

5* Prom the point of view of the present holders of sterling balances, acceptance of the scheme will depend, on theirassessment of possible alternatives.     The offer of a lump Assuming dollars (possibly over a period of years) in return for the surrender of more than the equivalent in sterling may not on examination seem altogether attractive - unless they think thatit is the only way to get dollars.      It may be assumed that thescheme would have no future unless India were brought in.     Theattitude of India may therefore be considered as typical partly of the reaction of the holders as a whole, and partly as showingparticular handicaps which would have to be surmounted.      In thefirst place it ought to be borne in mind that India would neveraccept a scheme of this sort unless she saw concrete advantages in it to herself.     There is no possibility that she could bebrought to admit that her sterling balances were not entirelyhers to dispose of as she wished.6.      (a)    It is clear from recent negotiations that India would need to keep substantial sterling balances whatever happened.India&apos;s sterling programme is very considerably above herprobable income over the next few years, and it would be singu-larly unterupting for India to accept dollars at a sacrifice toherself of sterling, and before long to be forced to sell thosedollars to us as the only means of providing for her sterlingneeds.(b) Allowing for the fact that some sterling would remainuntouched, the offer to India would be equivalent to selling hera given amount of dollars at a rate of (say) $2 for  1.     this might be attractive to her if the sterling balances were sofirmly locked up that their realisation appeared hopeless exceptover a very long period, say 50 or 100 years j   but the whole driftof recent settlements with India has been of such a nature that,between the current deficits and the financing of their bigcapital schemes, the Indian Government might hope to have securedrepayment in a matter of 5 years or so of all save enough toprovide a respectable cover for the currency (say  300 millionsout of the present figure of about  600 millions).(c) Prom the Indian point of view, the effect of partcancellation of the sterling balance would mean that India wouldhave to put an end to financing current deficits and reconstruc-tion programmes out of her foreign assets very much sooner than is now contemplated.     No doubt some alleviations might besecured by revaluing at current prices India&apos;s small gold holding and obviously there would in any case have to be an increase inthe fiduciary issue.     But such expedients would not take Indiavery far and she would be brought up sharply against the dangers of financing herself, as in the past, out of a reserve whichwould have been seriously decreased by the measures proposed.(d) Finally, it may be assumed that India would seek assur-ances that comparable treatment would be applied to other sterliniarea holders of sterling balances.     This would raise serious problems with Australia and New Zealand, who have made us giftsof  20 millions and  10 millions&apos; respectively, as well as withthe Colonies (see further below).7.      (a)    Our own attitude cannot disregard American exigenciesand Indian difficulties.      It would be essential for us tosecure that any sterling balances &quot;cancelled&quot; were in factcancelled and that the Americans retained no hold over them inany shape or form.     In effect sterling now held by, for example,India would have to be paid into the Exchequer (and used for thereduction of debt), no benefit remaining for,any third party.We must not accept any American conditions regarding the use out-side the sterling area of the remaining sterling balances or ofthe current earnings of India and other holders.        While itmight be true that the former holders would find themselvesshort of sterling on current account, so that there would in fact be nothing available for spending outside the sterling area, it

is highly undesirable to accept convertibility obligations so tospealc by a backdoor.     We must not be led into this sort ofbargain apart from a settlement of the convertibility problem- assuch. .    .(b) While we need not be unduly sympathetic with India&apos;s&apos;problems, we must consider our own problem of&apos; dislocation and unemployment if the settlement involved a severe and sudden stopin part of our export trade.     The recent agreement with Indiainvolved us in as steep a tapering off of our exports as was thought to be prudent.     There is no reason why we should not accept a further tapering offi    indeed it is to our advantage todo so, since (i) it will assist us in diverting our exports to more desirable markets and (ii) it is better to continue to taperoff in the near future rather than face a stop imposed by events,as will happen if we acquiesce in India&apos;s continuing to run heravailable balances down to exhaustion.(c) Nor could we wholly disregard the unfortunate politicaleffects in India itself of being suddenly &quot;reduced to poverty&quot;with the inevitable dislocation following the upsetting of suchplanning already entered upon.(d) On the other hand we should not accept any Indianargument to the effect that she is unable to make the sacrificesinvolved in this sort of formula, and that on the contrarygreater assistance should be given to the United Kingdom in orderthat -we may continue on our present path of unrequited exports toIndia.(e) We should find some difficulty at this stage in deter-mining how the principle of Section 10 could be applied equitably.Had action followed immediately in 1946 we could have dealt v/ithfigures as they then stood and it might not have been difficultto disentangle war-time accumulations from/to^ar-time holdings.Now, however, the balances have varied up and down in variouscases ,since the war.     There could be for example, no justice incutting increases in sterling balances which have taken place since the war and little logic in asking for a diminished sacrifice*-fice from India because she has already had a considerable amountrepaid (including repatriation of debt during the war).(f) Finally,&apos; from our point of view the choice of &quot;victims11for this formula is extremely difficult.      It would have to applyto India, Pakistan and Egypt if any useful purpose were to be served.      It v/ould raise great difficulties v/ith the riouthernCommonwealth countries;    and v/ith the Irish Republic (the built of whose holdings are in the hands of private individuals).     from our own point of view there seems little object in dealing inthis way v/ith the sterling balances of the Colonies (other thanPalestine).     We are committed to assist them in vast develop-ment programmes, and insofar as the sterling balances are a source of finance for such programmes we should merely have to re-providethe money turned in by them for cancellation. .   The effect wouldbe that the -Americans would have been persuaded into making a straight dollar gift to the Colonies and might well have subse-quent cause for complaint if immediately thereafter we showedour intention of reinstating the Colonies in their previousposition.8. Nevertheless, we sum up by saying that the objective of getting rid of a great block of the sterling balances is sowell worth while that we ought not to be deterred by the obstaclesset out above from pressing forward with whatever form of these suggestions may seem most acceptable to the Americans.      Successv/ould take the sting out of one of the most difficult aspects of anglo-American financial relations and be worth much more than theactual cash involved (an American contribution of $1 billion v/ouldat present rates of exchange &quot;kill&quot; say  500 millions of the balances).      It may well prove that the Americans v/ould be easier to deal with than the Indians (and other holders).     But if there

were a joint Anglo-American approachj holders might find itdifficult to resist, even if it meant a considerable revisionof existing sterling release agreements.      It could indeed be argued, and with much force, that a plan of this kind is to their long-term advantage.      If it calls a halt to the squandering offoreign assets, it also substitutes two debtors one of which provides otherwise unattainable dollars, while the other ismaterially helped back to a solvency which can only be threatenedand perhaps destroyed, by the continuance of unrequited exportson anything like the present scale.conclusions* The sterling balances question will be raised at theWashington talks.     We are somewhat vulnerable.2. But a positive approach might be really beneficial, andmight enlist United States support.3. We must recognise that the contributions to the kindof returns suggested come wholly from the Americans and the holders of the sterling balances,k* Our contribution could not be either in cash or in theacceptance of new obligations.     But we can -(a) use all our influence with the holders of sterling;(b) consider whether we are willing to reopen existing agreements;(c) use any other means open to us of bringing pressure to bear, including the threat of very harshfinancial terms in future.5. If the above is accepted, we should endeavour to enlist the sympathy of the Canadians, whose interests run withthose of the United States and ourselves, and who should there-fore help us both in the Washington talks and in any subsequenttalks with the Commonwealth balance holders.asury Chambers, S.W. 1 *23RD AUGUST, 1949.

ANNEX &apos;A?EXTRACT FROM FINANCIAL AGREEMENT BETWEENTHE GOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES ANDTHE UNITED KINGDOM. DATED&quot;5TH DECEMBER.1945 (Omd.  6708)10.    Accumulated Sterling Balances(i)   The Government of the United Kingdom intends to makeagreements with the countries concerned, varying according tothe circumstances of each case, for an early settlement covering the sterling balances accumulated by sterling area and othercountries prior to such settlement (together with any futurereceipts arising out of military expenditure by the Governmentof the United Kingdom to the extent to which they are treatedon the same basis by agreement with the countries concerned).The settlements with the sterling area countries will be on thebasis of dividing these accumulated balances into three categories:(a) balances to be released at once and convertible into any currency for current transactions;(b) balances to be similarly released by instalments overa period of years beginning in 1951;   and(c) balances to be adjusted as a contribution to thesettlement of war and post-war indebtedness and in recognition of the benefits which the countries concerned might be expected to gain from such asettlement.The Government of the United Kingdom will make every endeavour to secure the early completion of these arrangements.(ii)    In consideration of the fact that an important purposeof the present line of credit is to promote the development ofmultilateral trade and facilitate its early resumption on a non-discriminatory basis, the Government of the United Kingdom agrees that any sterling balances released or otherwise available for current payments will, not later than one year after the effec-tive date of this agreement, unless in special cases a later date is agreed upon after consultation, be freely available for current transactions in any currency area without discrimination.
