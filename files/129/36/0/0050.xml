THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1949314SECRETCP. (49) 200ltith October, 194931CABINETTHE COUNCIL OF europe memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate to my colleagues herewith (see Annex) a factual report on the workof the Council of Europe at its recent Session in Strasbourg from 8th august to 8th September, to which is appended (Appendix A) the text of the letter whichthe President of the Consultative Assembly has addressed to the Chairman ofthe Committee of Ministers transmitting the recommendations and resolutionsapproved by the Assembly.2. These recommendations and resolutions of the Assembly are summarised in the Annex as follows : &apos;3. These summaries are followed, in paragraphs 63 to 66, by two general observations concerning the recommendations and resolutions and by an outline of the provisions of the Statute under which the Committee of Ministers will haveto consider them. Finally, in paragraphs 67-73 will be found a general commen-tary on the result of this meeting of the Council as a whole.4. The present paper does not make any recommendations as to the attitude which His Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt towards the various proposals,or as to the line which I should take at the meeting of the Committee of ministers in November. The following comments may, however, be of use to my colleagues in considering the report.5. In the opening debate in the Assembly on the political structure ofEurope several speakers gave expression to very far-reaching ideas, such, forinstance, as the federal solution for Europe, the.creation of a European political authority, the endowment of the Committee of Ministers with supranationalpowers, and the creation of a European Civil Service. These ideas were referredto the General Affairs Committee of the Assembly, and have therefore figured inthe report of that Committee and in the resolutions of the Assembly summarised in paragraph 41 of the attached report. It should be noted, however, that theseresolutions do not do more than recommend that the General Affairs committee or the Standing Committee of the Assembly should study these matters and reporton their implications. The ideas themselves have not in any way been formallyendorsed by the Assembly, and the Committee of Ministers will not be called uponto take action on them in November. By the time the Committees have completed their studies and made their report in April 1950, it is quite likely that the lesspractical proposals will have been eliminated. The Assembly will then have tomake its recommendations for the later consideration of the Committee ofMinisters.ParagraphEconomic Questions   ...      ...General AffairsCultural and Scientific QuestionsSocial QuestionsProcedural Questions......      ...Human Rights ...      .........European Patent OfficeNationality Laws and European PassportRefugees49-50384144475255575937682a
6. In my view the recommendations and resolutions, though greatly improved by the efforts of the Labour members of the British Delegation, still laythemselves open to severe criticism. In particular, they show an excessivereadiness to endorse superficially attractive proposals, paying too little heed tothe practical implications. They often fail to take into sufficient account thework of other existing international bodies both on the governmental and on thenon-governmental plane. Moreover, it is evident that the general mood of theAssembly was one of far greater readiness to embark on some definite scheme fora unified Europe in the near future than is likely to appeal to Governments orto find justification in the Statute itself. The point is well summed up by thestatement in one of the resolutions of the Assembly that it &quot; considers that the aim and goal of the Council of Europe is the creation of a European political authority with limited functions but real powers.&quot; This compares with the very different phraseology of Article 1 (A) of the Statute of the Council of Europe,which states : &quot; The aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unitybetween its members for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic andsocialprogress.&quot;7. It is clear, therefore, that the various resolutions of the Assembly requirethe most careful study, and I propose in a subsequent paper to set forth myconsidered views as to the attitude we should adopt in regard to them at the next meeting of the Committee of Ministers. Great care will clearly have to be takento see to it that none of the Assembly proposals that we may agree to would affect unfavourably decisions taken elsewhere and notably during the tripartiteconversations in Washington; and we must also beware lest the Assembly shouldbe used as a means of putting political pressure on us in such organisations asthe o:e.e.c8. The Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and the Chief Whip agree generally with this paper and the annexedreport.E. B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1,10th October, 1949.
v ;  ,   &apos; ANNEX   ....REPORT ON THE FIRST SESSION OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE8th August to 8th September, 1949I. introduction the Preparatory Commission for the establishment of the Council of Europe,set up on 5th May, 1949, at the same time as the Statute of the Council of europe was signed, met from May to July in Paris. A meeting, at which all the foreign ministers concerned were represented, was held in Paris on 5th and 6th August,1949, to prepare the way for the Committee of Ministers, and reached agreement on the less important points in the Preparatory Commission^ Final Report. ThisFinal Report, with the work done on it by the preparatory meeting, formed thebasis for the discussions of the Committee of Ministers at their meeting atStrasbourg from 8th to 13th August.2. The Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe met from10th August until 8th September.   Its work proceeded in three stages : (a) general debate in the Assembly;(6) detailed work in the committees set up by the Assembly;(c) second debate in the Assembly on the reports prepared by the committees,resulting in resolutions or in recommendations to the Committee ofMinisters.       ,3. These recommendations have now been transmitted by the Chairman ofthe Consultative Assembly to the Chairman of the Committee of Ministers (seeAppendix A), and the latter body will consider them at their next meeting atthe beginning of November.II. Work of the Committee of Ministers4.   The A genda before the Committee of Ministers was as follows : Part I&apos;  (1) Admission of new members.(2) Report of the Preparatory Commission : (a) Draft rules of procedure for the Committee of Ministers.(b) Draft rules of procedure&apos; for the Consultative Assembly.(c) Draft agenda for the Consultative Assembly.(d) Draft budget for 1949.(e) Financial and administrative regulations.(/) Preliminary report on the staff requirements of the Secretariat.(g) Draft General Agreement on the privileges and immunities of theCouncil of Europe.(h) Draft Special Agreement between the Council of Europe and theGovernment of the French Republic concerning the seat of theCouncil of Europe.(i) Contributions from each of the Members to the expenses of theCouncil for 1949.(3) Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to the Assembly forthe nomination of the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General.(4) Statement to the Assembly under Article 19 of the Statute.Part II(1) Examination of items proposed by the Assembly for inclusion in itsagenda.(2) Dissolution of the Preparatory Commission.(3) Any other business.(4) Date of the next meeting.37682 b
\ jf-First two ^meetings5. Part I of the Agenda was dealt with by the Committee of ministers at sittings on 8th, 9th and 10th August.6. On item (1) (the admission of new members) the Committee of ministers decided to invite the Governments of Greece, Turkey and Iceland to join theCouncil of Europe, their representation in the Assembly being 8, 6 and 3 seats,respectively, and their contributions to the Budget being regulated by the samemethod of calculation as that employed for fixing those of the existing members.The Greek and Turkish Ministers for Foreign Affairs and delegations to the consultative Assembly in the event took their places from 9th August onwards,but for constitutional reasons Iceland was not represented (see paragraph 16below). No member of the Committee of Ministers raised the question of thepossible admission of either Germany, Austria or the Saar at that time.7. On item (2) (a) (rules of procedure for the Committee of Ministers), theCommittee approved the draft Rules with the exception of Article 12, concerningthe right of the Members of the Committee of Ministers to speak in the Assembly.It was finally agreed first that Ministers could speak in the Assembly on behalfof the Committee of Ministers collectively, secondly, that Ministers should beentitled to intervene individually on any subject on the Assembly&apos;s agendaprovided that they obtained the consent of the Committee, which would be givenby simple majority; and thirdly, that these two proposals should go forward tothe Consultative Assembly for their observations in accordance with Article 27of the Statute.8. On item (2) (b) (draft rules of procedure for the Consultative Assembly),the Committee agreed to transmit the draft rules of procedure unamended to theAssembly with the suggestion that a joint committee of the Assembly and theCommittee of Ministers should discuss those rules which were of common concern to both bodies.9. On item (2) (c) (draft agenda for the Consultative Assembly), the Com^mittee had before them a list of fourteen items drawn up by the PreparatqryCemmission. It was finally agreed that this list contained items which, although they might be suggested by the Assembly itself for discussion, should not be listedas items on which the Committee of Ministers requested the opinion of theAssembly under Article 23 (a) (i) of the Statute, and that these should be confined to-(a) The role of the Council of Europe in the economic field, taking account ofexisting international organisations.(b) The role of the Council of European the field of social security.(c) Methods by which the Council of Europe could develop cultural co-opera-tion between its Members.The necessary procedural items should in addition be included.10. Items (2) (d), (e), (/), (g), (h) and (i) (budget, financial and administrativeregulations, staff requirements, agreement on privileges and immunities, agreementwith the French Government, and financial contributions) had been considered bythe preliminary meeting of the representatives of. the Foreign Ministers and sub-stantial agreement had been reached on any amendments which were necessary.It sufficed for the Committee of Ministers formally to approve the documents.11. On item (3) (appointment of the Secretary General and Deputy secretary general), the Committee agreed to recommend M. J. C. Paris and Mr. A. S.Halford for each post respectively.12. On item (4) (report to the Assembly), the Committee approved the termsof a letter from the Chairman to the President of the Consultative Assemblyinforming him of the decisions of the Committee affecting the Assembly and trans-mitting to him the provisional rules of procedure for the Assembly and the pro-visional agenda for the session.   (See Appendix B.)Subsequent Meetings13. The Committee of Ministers reassembled on Friday, 12th August, toconsider with M. Spaak, who had in the meantime been elected President of the consultative Assembly, difficulties which had arisen in the Assembly with regard
to the interpretation of Article 13 of the provisional rules of procedure for theAssembly, which laid down a time limit of three days within which requests fromthe Assembly to the Committee of Ministers for the inclusion of additional ques-tions on the agenda must be submitted. It was agreed that such requests mustreach the Committee by midnight on 13th August, and that if, after this date, theAssembly should decide by a majority of two-thirds to make other proposals con-cerning questions to be added to its agenda, the Committee would give a reply tosuch proposals within five days from the date of their receipt.14. In accordance with the previous decision, and with Part II of itsagenda, the Committee reassembled on Saturday, 13th August, to consider theadditional items proposed by the&apos; Assembly for inclusion on its agenda. these had been transmitted to the Committee by a letter dated 13th August from the clerk of the Consultative Assembly to the Chairman of the Committee ofMinisters. After discussion the agenda proposed by the Assembly was approved.A copy of the Chairman&apos;s letter conveying this approval to the Assembly is at appendix C.15. At the same meeting it was suggested that some provision should bemade to take into account the strong wish expressed in the Assembly that theCommittee of Ministers should not be the sole judge of the admission of new members to the Council of Europe. On the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal, however,this suggestion was not pursued.16. At the same meeting the Preparatory Commission was formallydissolved, a committee of financial experts was appointed to consider the budget,and note was taken of a communication from the Icelandic Government to theaffect that they highly appreciated the friendly invitation to join the Councilof Europe and that this would be submitted with a recommendation for acceptanceto the Icelandic Parliament later in the year. Finally, it was agreed in principlethat the next meeting should be held at the end of October,* it being understoodthat the Chairman of the Committee should remain in close touch with thePresident of the Assembly in the meantime, and that, if necessary, he should be present in Strasbourg during the last two days of the Session of the Assembly.In the event he did attend the last two meetings of the Assembly.III. Analysis of the Decisions Reached by the Committee of Ministers17. The Committee of Ministers thus, in their various meetings before and during the first sessions of the Consultative Assembly, approved the formal steps necessary for the establishment of the Council of Europe, settled the immediate question of new admissions and, finally, in consultation with the President ofthe Assembly, reached agreement on, the Assembly&apos;s agenda and certain points of its rules of procedure. *18. The conciliatory attitude adopted by the Committee, particularly in approving without amendment the inclusion on the Assembly&apos;s agenda of all the items which the Assembly had itself proposed, and the presence of M. Van Zeelandin Strasbourg at the end of the Assembly&apos;? session did much to remove the feeling of antagonism between the two bodies which had made itself felt in the earlydebates in the Assembly.*IV. Work of the Consultative AssemblyOpening of the Assembly and Election of the Officers19. On 10th August, M. Herriot, who had been appointed provisionalPresident&apos; of the Assembly by the Preparatory Commission, formally opened theAssembly by an inaugural speech in which he traced the history of the idea ofEuropean Union and emphasised the importance of the Council of Europe&apos;ssucceeding where so many earlier efforts had failed. The only point affectingthe debates of the Assembly which he mentioned concerned the question ofGermany, on which he sounded a note of caution. The meeting was thenadjourned in order that further discussions might take place about the candidates for the Presidency of the Assembly.* Subsequently altered to early November.&apos; j      37682 b 2
20. On 11th August the Assembly unanimously elected M. Spaak as president, he being the only candidate put forward. The Assembly then electedfour Vice-Presidents : M. de Menthon (France), M. Jacini (Italy), M. Kraft(Denmark) and Lord Lay ton (United Kingdom). The only other candidates hadbeen Mr. Whiteley and Mr. De Valera, both of whom were out-voted,-Mr. Whiteleyby the narrow margin of five votes between him and Lord Lay ton, after anacrimonious argument, initiated by Sir R. Ross on a point of order which thePresident rejected, continued by Mr. Churchill, and answered by Mr. Morrison,to the effect that a member of His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be impartialas between the Assembly and the Committee of Ministers. There can be no doubtthat Mr. Whiteley&apos;s defeat was due to these interventions by the BritishConservatives.21. On the afternoon of 11th August the Assembly, on the recommendationof the Committee of Ministers, nominated M. Paris and Mr. Half ord as Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General respectively, after some debate had takenplace in which a number of Representatives, including Mr. Norton (irish republic) and Mr. Boothby and Mr. Churchill (United Kingdom) pressed for theestablishment of a separate Secretariat for the Assembly. The Assembly thenadopted its provisional rules of procedure, drawn up by the Preparatory Corn-mission, pending their final revision and adoption.Agenda22. On the same day, 11th August, the Assembly considered its agenda,consisting of procedural items and the three subjects referred to the Assemblyby the Committee of Ministers on the Council&apos;s role in the economic, social security and cultural fields. Strong opposition was shown to the article in the provisionalrules of procedure which made it necessary for the Assembly to choose and submit to the Committee of Ministers within three days the additional subjects whichis wished to place on the Agenda. It was agreed that the President should informthe Committee of Ministers of the strong feelings on this subject held by theAssembly and report further.23. On 12th August the Assembly approved a report from the Presidentof his consultations with the Committee of Ministers on this subject (see para-graph 13 above) and invited the Bureau to draw up a list of additional items forthe agenda for approval by the Assembly and submission to the Committee ofMinisters by midnight on 13th August.24. C*n 13th August the Assembly considered the report of the Bureau and finally approved the list of additional items for its agenda for submission to theCommittee of Ministers that evening.24a. On 16th August the Assembly adopted its final agenda as approved bythe Committee of Ministers on 13th August (see Appendix C).General Debate on Political Structure of Europe25. The Assembly then proceeded to the general debate on any necessary changes in the political structure of Europe to achieve a greater unity between members of the Council of Europe and to make effective European co-operation in the various spheres specified in Article 1 of the Statute. This general debatelasted throughout 16th and 17th August.26. There were no less than forty-five speakers, divided, very broadly speaking,into three main groups : the out and out Federalists, the functionalists and a thirdgroup concerned principally with suggestions for amending the Statute. The first group, surprisingly small, made no secret of their desire for a federal constitution in the near future, although even the most ardent accepted the need for further study of the problem. In the second group there were a number of what may becalled &quot; crypto-federalists &quot; such as Mr. Boothby and Mr. Macmillan, wishing tosee the Committee of Ministers and the Assembly built up into an internationalexecutive and legislative body with an international Civil Service; this group didnot, however, urge the transfer of specific powers to a federal authority as such.Mr. Churchill stated that he was not committed to a federal solution. The mainpart of the second group, which comprised the majority of speakers, while payinglip-service to the vague conception of European unity, seemed content for thepresent to press for closer co-operation through existing organisations under the
eye of the Council of Europe. The third group, also considerable, ur^etllmend-ments to the Statute to give the Assembly greater freedom, in particular completeliberty to settle its own agenda, the possibility of having at least two sessions ayear, and the right to set up standing committees to work between sessions.Several speakers mentioned the importance of avoiding antagonism between theCommittee of Ministers and the Assembly, and Mr. Morrison emphasised that progress towards greater unity must be based on the consent of each of the peoplesconcerned through their Parliaments, no Government being in a position to signaway sovereignty without a mandate from the electorate.27. In addition to the general discussion of structural changes, the debateranged over a wide field, including economic co-operation, the admission ofGermany and even the partition of Ireland. There seemed to be a general feeling that organisations such as O.E.E.C. were not going fast or far enough and lackedpolitical control. On Germany, the balance of opinion, but probably not a two-thirds majority, seemed to be in favour of her admission as soon as possible, this line being strongly supported by Mr. Churchill and by some other United Kingdom,Scandinavian and Italian representatives. M. Bidault, on the other hand, sup-ported by other French representatives, including M. Mollet (Socialist), arguedagainst her admission until the German Government had proved its good inten-tions and democratic character, and urged that the admission of the Saar shouldnot be postponed until after a decision on Germany. An exchange of recrimina-tions between the representatives of the Irish Republic and Sir Ronald Ross was,not for the first or last time, strongly disapproved by the Assembly.28. To sum up, there was a unanimous desire on the part of the assembly to do something to achieve greater unity in Europe, but certainly no unanimityas to what should be done. It was clear, however, that there would be increasing pressure to amend the Statute, particularly as regards the settlement of theAssembly&apos;s agenda, and that the various federal solutions had not been thoroughlythought out. To rectify this last point the United Kingdom Labour Party repre-sentatives proposed that a Commission of the Assembly should undertake a fulland objective study of all the proposals put forward for a closer political union in Europe.Constitution of Committees29. On 18th August the Assembly discussed procedure and the constitutionof committees. It was agreed that the normal procedure should be for an itemon the agenda to be the subject of a general debate in the Assembly, then to bereferred to a committee for a report, and for there then to be a further debate onthe report with a view to formulating a resolution. Certain technical subjectscould be referred by the Bureau direct to committees. The Assembly set upcommittees on the following subjects : (1) General Affairs.(2) Economic Questions.(3) Legal and Administrative Questions.(4) Rules of Procedure and Privileges.(5) Social Questions.(6) Cultural and Scientific Questions.The first three of these Committees consist of twenty-three members and theother three of eighteen members each. In the 23-member Committees France,Italy and the United Kingdom nominate three representatives, Belgium, Greece,the Netherlands, Sweden and Turkey two representatives, and Denmark, the irish republic, Luxembourg and Norway one representative. In the 18-memberCommittees France, Italy and the United Kingdom nominate three representatives and the other members one representative each. A proposal by a French Sengaleserepresentative for the establishment of a Committee to study questions relating to overseas territories was narrowly defeated. The question of substitutes sitting in Committees while the representatives for whom they were acting were inStrasbourg was remitted to the Committee on Rules of Procedure. Nominationsto the various committtees were agreed at a subsequent sitting on 22nd August.General Debate on Human Rights30. On 19th August the Assembly had its first general debate on measures for the fulfilment of the declared aim of the Council of Europe in accordance with
Article 1 of the Statute in regard to the maintenance and further realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The general view was that membersof the Council of Europe offered their people more and better human rights than any other countries, but that in view of the threat of totalitarian encroachmentthey should take action to prevent any possibility of these rights being whittledaway in any country. There was strong support, led by M. Teitgen (France) andSir David Maxwell-Fyfe, for proposals previously circulated by the EuropeanMovement to the effect that a Convention should be signed by all membersguaranteeing basic human rights, defined in very general terms, that a Commissionand a Court of Human Rights should be set up under this Convention which states or individuals could petition and, finally, that a more detailed schedule of human rights should be drafted to which all members should subscribe. In the debatesome speakers also emphasised the need for a definition of economic and socialrights as well as political. The problem of European displaced persons was alsotouched on.General Debate on Economic Questions31. On 23rd and 24th August the Assembly held its two-day general debate on the role of the Council of Europe in the economic field, taking account, inaccordance&apos; with Articles 1 (c) and 23 (b) of the Statute, of existing international organisations. The principal speakers on the first day were Mr. Mackay andMr. Dalton, M. Reynaud (France), Mr. David Eccles, M. van der Kieft (Holland),M. Bonnefous and M. Andre Philip (France) : on the second day, Lord Lay ton,M. Bertil Ohlin (Sweden), Mr. Lee and Mr. Harold Macmillan. On the diagnosisof Europe&apos;s ills there was little disagreement: they were due to the change inEurope&apos;s economic position brought about on the one hand by the materialdestruction of two major wars and the loss of overseas. investments, and on theother hand by the fact that the United States had become at once by far theworld&apos;s greatest producer and the world&apos;s greatest creditor nation. Mr. Daltonquoted figures to show that, contrary to much current propaganda, the UnitedKingdom had the best record of all the countries represented at Strasbourg in increased production and exports as compared with pre-war, and in the increasein the proportion of its dollar imports paid for by its dollar exports. Some- speakers showed that the United States tariff policy ran completely counter tothe Americans&apos; constant exhortation to the countries of Europe to sell more goods to the dollar area. MM. Bonnefous and Andre Philip made specific reference tothe problems of the Ruhr, calling for a real international authority, which should deal not only with the Ruhr itself but with European heavy industry as a whole,thus providing a starting-point for a general co-ordination of heavy industry,irrespective of whether industry in each country concerned was conducted on acollectivised or a private enterprise basis. There was a large measure of agree-ment that O.E.E.C. was not succeeding in its primary task of co-ordinating theseveral economies : as a body of experts &apos;&apos; without a political head,&apos;&apos; in the words of M. Bonnefous, it could not succeed. Finally, a number of speakers took theview that steps must be taken to enable the Council of Europe to represent theinterests of Europe as a whole vis-a-vis the United States, and to confer directly with the United States Government.Procedure and Privilege32. At the close of the debate on 24th August, Mr. Dalton raised a point of order in connexion with la resolution which had been circulated to the press witha statement that it had been &quot; inspired by the European Movement,&quot; and movedthat for an outside body to claim that it was inspiring the activities of theAssembly was a breach of privilege. The matter was referred to the Committee on procedure and Privileges.33. On 24th August the Assembly also adopted a revised draft for article 36of the provisional rules of procedure for the Assembly concerning substitutes,though Mr. Morrison and others warned the Assembly of the dangers to a Parlia-mentary institution of the indiscriminate use of substitutes. This provided thata member prevented from attending a meeting of the Assembly or of a committee might be replaced by a substitute of the same nationality, or in the case of aCommittee by another representative or. by a substitute of his own nationality,provided that the President or the Chairman of the Committee was warned. This
t 3ibrepresented a considerable relaxation of the provisional rules of procedure. Sub-sequently, however, the Assembly changed its mind about substitutes and recom-mended their abolition as unparliamentary. (See paragraph 41 below.)General Debate on Social Security34. On 26th August the Assembly had its general debate on the role of theCouncil of Europe in the field of social security (including such proposals as a european housing policy and the possibility of granting to individuals employedin other countries than their own the same rights to social benefits as those enjoyed by the nationals of those countries.) This was thinly attended and produced nostriking results except an excellent account by Mr. Whiteley of the progress of social security in the United Kingdom and a reminder by M. Serrarens (Nether-lands) that full use should be made of the accumulated experience of the Inter-national Labour Office. Italian speakers referred to the problem of the emigrantworker in connexion with social security.General Debate on Cultural Co-operation35. Also on 26th August the Assembly held its general debate on methods by which the Council of Europe can develop cultural co-operation between its members. No point of particular interest was raised and the short debate con-cluded with the reference of various resolutions to the Committee on Cultural and scientific Questions, which was instructed also to consider an item on the agenda,proposed by Miss Herbison, concerning the closer collaboration in scientific research and technical development between the constituent countries of theCouncil of Europe and the maximum pooling of material resources and technicalman-power for that purpose.Committee Stage36. During the week from 28th August to 3rd September the Committeesestablished by the Assembly worked in private on the motions and resolutions which had come forward to them from the general debates in the Assembly or on particular technical items on the Assembly&apos;s agenda which had been referred tothem direct without prior debate in the Assembly. The Chairman of each Com-mittee informed the press each evening of the day&apos;s proceedings. The Committeesremained in being until the end of the Assembly&apos;s session, since even afterpreparing their reports for the Assembly they had in some oases to revise themin the light of the Assembly&apos;s discussions.Report of the Economic Committee37. On 2nd and 3rd September the Assembly considered the report of theEconomic Committee. On 5th September the report was approved in its finalamended form by 88 votes to 2, with 11 abstentions.38.   The following is a summary of the report as approved: I. The Committee of Ministers are requested : (1) To invite their Governments to intensify the spread of economic information through existing channels, and to provide facilities for theCouncil of Europe to bring home to the peoples of Europe the peril of theirsituation and the advantages of uniting their resources;(2) To take all practical steps to establish a multilateral system ofpayments, and to restore inter-convertibility of European currencies;(3) To create machinery for consultation between central banks on creditpolicy;(4) (a) To follow up and extend the work of O.E.E.C. on theliberalisation of inter-European trade, and all studies nowbeing made on the economic relations of Europe and associatedoverseas territories;(b) To take preliminary action for the establishment of a european economic union;(c) To study the development of production in Member States inorder that their import requirements can be met as efficientlyas possible from their combined resources;
(d) To study the possibility of removing obstacles to the free move-ment of manpower;(e) To study the possibility of encouraging investment in Europeof American and other non-European capital;(/) To extend and develop a system of guaranteed markets;(g) To call an economic conference to study the above proposals;(5) To call industrial conferences, representing employers, workers and consumers, as well as governmental services, to make concrete proposals tothe Assembly for the organisation of the main manufacturing and agricul-tural industries and the increase of productivity;(6) To draw up a draft European convention for the control of inter-national cartels.II. The Committee of Ministers are also requested : (a) To submit to the Consultative Assembly proposals to meet the recom-mendations above and a report on progress since the last session;(&amp;) After the proposals have been considered, to nominate a delegation fromthe Council of Europe to negotiate with the United States Govern-ment, or any other Government concerned, regarding modifications in existing agreements and in United States tariff policy.III. The Assembly further propose : (1) (a) That the Economic Committee may sit in the interval betweensessions;(6) That it may split into specialised sub-committees;(c) That the latter may hear evidence from experts on their ownsubjects.(2) The President of the Assembly shall make contact with the Secre-tariat of U.N.O., O.E.E.C. and the Bank for International Settlement, witha view to securing access to their documents, and arranging for their inter-national and national officers to be heard by the Economic Committee if thisis desired.39. The debates were characterised by a feeling, even among some of itsauthors, that the report was an unrealistic and poor document; in the absenceof anything better and in the interests of unanimity, most representatives were,however, prepared, after it had been somewhat improved by amendments, to vote for its adoption. Attempts made in Committee and in the Assembly to discussthe devaluation issue were heavily outvoted, as was a proposal to transformO.E.E.C. into a permanent body under the direct supervision of the Council ofEurope. Omissions such as the importance of full-employment and of guaranteedmarkets were rectified. But it did not prove possible to do very much to bringthe report into more manageable form, in spite of the attention drawn by severalspeakers to its obviously unreal proposals (such as that for a Council of Europedelegation to negotiate with the United States Government) or to those which seemed unnecessary (such as the calling of a new economic conference).Report of the General Affairs Committee40. On 5th September the Assembly considered the report of the GeneralAffairs Committee. On 6th September the report was approved in its finalamended form by 88 votes to none.41.   The following is a summary of the report as approved: I. The General Affairs Committee is instructed to examine andreport on : (a) the general position of Member States considered as a whole;(b) the present situation with regard to inter-governmental organisa-tions;(c) the various proposals for extended collaboration;(d) the political and constitutional modifications which (c) above would entail;(e) federal and other proposals for the future political development ofEurope; and(/) the effect of such measures on each Member State.
The. Committee shall have power to appoint sub-committees, to obtainthe assistance of experts, and to hear witnesses. The report is to be sub-mitted to the President of the Assembly by 30th April. It will be debatedat the 1950 session, and the Assembly request that the recommendations thenadopted will immediately be discussed by the national Parliaments.II. A Standing Committee consisting of the President, the four Vice-Presidents, and 23 members of the Assembly is set up. It will meet notless than four times a year.Its duties will be (a) to co-ordinate resolutions of the Assembly and reports or recom-mendations from the Committees;(&amp;) to prepare the Assembly&apos;s programme of work;(c) generally to facilitate and expedite the work of the Assembly.The President, acting on behalf of the Committee, will consult theCommittee of Ministers about convening an extraordinary session and any matters arising out of the last session.III. Other Resolutions(1) Proposals already made for an extraordinary session of the assembly to be referred to the Standing Committee. The Assembly regards such an extraordinary session as inevitable.(2) If a simple majority of members of the Consultative Assembly ask the President for an extraordinary session, the President should convey this request to the Committee of Ministers.(3) Secretary-General to request the Committee of Ministers to providefunds for the Standing Committee.(4) Standing Committee to study proposals (i) that the Committee of Ministers should urge their Governments to instruct the peoples of Europe in the dangers of isolation andthe advantages of union;(ii) that Article 13 of the Statute (laying down that the Committeeof Ministers is the organ which acts for the Council) should be.  amended;(iii) to create a European political authority;(iv) to endow the Committee of Ministers with supra-national powers;(v) to create a European civil service.(5) Proposals for amendment of Article 20 of the Statute (dealing withthe voting procedure in the Committee of Ministers) to be referred to theGeneral Affairs Committee and covered in the report to be submitted by30th April, 1950 (see I above).(6) General Affairs Committee to draw up by 30th April, 1950, for submission to the Assembly, a binding European Agreement defining the basic principles of the Council and outlawing war between members.(7) The Assembly considers that the aim of the Council of Europe is&quot;the creation of a European political authority with limited functions but&apos;real powers.&quot;IV. Recommendations to the Committee of Ministers(a) In regard to the amendment of the Statute: A articles 4 and 5. (Accessions to membership and associate member-ship). Amendment to make admission to the Council subject to theapproval of a simple majority of the Consultative Assembly.A rticle 23. Amendment of which the effect is to remove the control by the Committee of Ministers over the agenda of the consultative assembly.Articles 25 (c) and 26. Amendment to double the number of repre-sentatives and abolish substitutes.Article 36. Amendment to provide for two Deputy Secretaries-General, instead of one as at present, one for the Committee of ministers and the other for the Assembly.37682 c
II s vvst i. %article 37 (&amp;). Amendment to make the Secretary-General responsi-ble to the Committee of Ministers &quot; and to the Consultative Assembly.&quot;The two Deputies to be responsible to the bodies they respectively serve.Article 41 (d). Amendment to enable the provision for easy amend -ment of certain articles of the Statute to apply immediately instead of only at the end of the second ordinary session of the Assembly.Certain consequential amendments(b) That before the next session of the Assembly, the Committee ofMinisters should consider the question of new admissions, and that thisquestion should be on the agenda of the next session.42n In the Debate, the Committee&apos;s report proved to be generally acceptableand there were few amendments down. In particular the proposal concerningthe establishment of a Standing Committee to co-ordinate the work of the Assemblyas a whole and control its tendency to run wild, and the suggestion that theGeneral Affairs Committee should study all the proposals, some of them irresponsi-ble, which had been put forward in the first general debate for structural changes and federalism, commanded general agreement. The purposely vague formularegarding the consideration of new admissions to the Council was criticised byan Italian representative, with some support from others, for not specificallymentioning Germany. This argument was disposed of rapidly by the UnitedKingdom and French representatives. There was little or no opposition tothe proposal made in debate and incorporated in the final report, that a further amendment to the statute should be recommended to abolish substitutes and double the number of representatives. It is possible, however, that the Assembly wouldbe content with an increase of about 25 per cent, in its number of representatives,since this figure was mentioned by Mr. Mackay in moving the amendment andwas not objected to by any subsequent speaker.Report of the Cultural and Scientific Committee43. On 6th September the Assembly considered the report of the Culturaland Scientific Committee. On 7th September the report was approved in its finalamended form by 89 votes to none with two abstentions.44.   The following is a summary of the report as approved : I. Recommendations to the Committee of Ministers (a) to establish a system of cultural conventions between Member States;\b) to promote free circulation and exchange between Member States of books, papers, works of art and documentary films;(c) to consider closer collaboration, and the pooling of material and man-power, in scientific research and technical development;(d) to provide for aid to private organisations working to promoteEuropean culture;(e) to invite Ministers of Education of Member States to meet and.draw up a European plan for cultural co-operation for submission to theAssembly;(/) to invite the responsible authorities of Universities to meet;(g) to institute a European Cultural Centre.II. Resolutions(a) The Assembly considers that the question of a European Universityshould be discussed next session.(b) Attention of Ministers of Education is drawn to plight of displacedteachers.(c) Assembly expresses hope that effective liaison will be established with.N.E.S.C.O.45. The debate consisted of a long and meandering discussion, although fewamendments were down. An attempt to raise the question of secular versusclerical education was firmly squashed. An amendment by Mr. de Valera,designed to show that the Assembly regarded culture as an end in itself and not as a means of propaganda for European unity, was defeated.
Report of the Committee on Social Questions46. On 6th September the Assembly also considered the report of the Com-mittee on Social Questions. On the same day the report was approved in its finalamended form by 85 votes to none, after a very short debate in which no points of substance arose.47.   The following is a summary of the report as approved : .I. The following recommendations are made to Member States : Social Security(i) To perfect their social security legislation to a standard not neces-sarily uniform, but equally high in all countries,(ii) To examine the possibility of a general ratification of international conventions of social security.(iii) To prepare, in the light of experience already gained throughbilateral and regional agreements, a multilateral agreement makingthe social legislation of Member States completely applicable toother nationals.(iv) To note the importance of the problem of emigrant workers, andthat countries accepting workers from other countries should give them the same social rights as their own nationals.(v) To ratifv as soon as possible the International Convention adoptedby the I.L.O. in June 1949.II. The following instructions are issued by the Assembly to the Committeeon Social Questions : (i) to continue to examine the question of social security after the session, entering into contact with I.L.O. and any other organisa-tions which may seem desirable;(ii) to organise interchange of information on housing between member states;(iii) to undertake a complete study of emigration.Report of the Procedure Committee on Breach of Privilege -48. On 7th September the Assembly considered a report of the Committeeon Rules of Procedure on Mr. Dalton&apos;s motion (paragraph 32 above) concerningthe possible breach of privilege Which was constituted by the circulation of aresolution by the European Movement during the general debate on economic questions. The report also dealt with a motion by Mr. MacKay to the effect thatany action or attempt made by persons not members of the Assembly, with a viewto influencing the Assembly representatives on questions concerning the internal affairs of the Assembly and election to its high offices in particular, should be con-sidered as an infringement of the priviliges of the Assembly, and that personsguilty of such a breach of privilege might be denied access to the building.49. The resolution approved by the Assembly in fact finds that no breach of privilege had taken place, but the body of the report made it clear that theprotection of the prestige and independence of the Assembly against unwarrantedintervention and unseemly confusion, which organisations outside the Councilof Europe might attempt as part of their propaganda or for their own specialends, was of great importance. This is a clear warning to organisations suchas the European Movement not to interfere improperly in the work of the Assembly.Report of the Procedure Committee on the Provisional Rules of Procedure50. On 7th September the Assembly considered a report from the Rules ofProcedure Committee on their revision of the provisional rules of procedure. Thereport showed that the Committee had only reached Article 7 of the provisionalrules, and asked for more time to complete their task. The Assembly approved the following resolution : &quot; The Assembly approves the formation of a Sub-Committee of theCommittee for Procedure and Privileges consisting of six members includingnecessarily the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and rapporteur of the said com-mittee, whose task shall be to compile by means of any necessary contacts, adraft for final rules of procedure which will be submitted to the Assembly.&quot;37682 c 2
The reference to &quot; any necessary contacts &quot; was inserted to ensure that thesub-committee took advice from experts in Parliamentary procedure.Report of the Legal and Administrative Committee on Human Rights51. On 8th September the Assembly considered the report of the Legal andAdministrative Committee on the maintenance and further realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The same day the report was approved in its final amended form by 65 votes to 1 with 20 abstentions.52.   The following is a summary of the Report as approved: (1) The Assembly recommends that the Committee of Ministers shall as soonas possible cause to be drawn up a draft Human Rights Convention;a draft giving the general lines of this Convention forms the body ofthe Report.(2) In order to ensure the observance by Member States of the provisions ofthe Convention, there shall be established a European Commission for human Rights and a European Court of Justice.(3) During the next session, the Assembly shall have a report from theCommittee of Ministers on the steps taken to follow up this recom-mendation.53. The debate lasted almost all day and late into the evening, producinglively discussion. As expected, the main proposal in the Committee&apos;s report wasa draft convention listing personal and political rights and freedoms based onthe United Nations Declaration. These should be guaranteed collectively throughmachinery consisting of a European Commission of Enquiry and conciliation and a European Court. Both in Committee and in the Assembly Mr. Ungoed&quot;Thomas and M. Rolin (Belgium) urged the deletion of any reference to a court,on the grounds that a court would not be able to administer such a vaguely phrasedlist of human rights and that, in any case, the international Court of Justiceat The Hague could, if need be, be adapted to serve the purpose which theAssembly had in mind. They also took grave exception to the proposal thatindividuals could call in question decisions under their own democratic lawsby appeal to an international authority. These speakers and their supporterswere however, out-voted. A dangerously vague definition of the right to property and the right of parents to decide the education to be given to their children,both included in the list of human rights, were the occasion of considerablecontroversy between Left and Right, this being one of the very few occasions on which the Assembly tended to split on purely party lines. These two points were in the end not included in the report but referred back to the Committeefor further study. The same action was taken, largely for technical reasons, ona motion by Mr. Cocks declaring that any use of torture was a crime againsthumanity. The abstentions were made up almost entirely of United KingdomLabour representatives, the Turks, and a number of French and Belgian Catholics,the latter objecting to the omission of the right of parents to decide the education of their children.Report of the Economic Committee on the Creation of a European Patent Office-54. On 8th September the Assembly considered a report of the EconomicCommittee advocating the creation of a European Patent Office, an item on theAssembly&apos;s Agenda which had been referred direct to the Committee withouta prior general debate in the Assembly. The report was approved after minoramendment but little debate, by 78 votes to. none, with 7 abstentions. Therewas no discussion of the draft Convention annexed to the report.55.   The following is a summary of the report as approved:: The Assembly (1) Transmits to the Committee of Ministers an annexed proposal for thecreation of a European Patents Office.(2) Requests the Committee of Ministers to inform the Standing Committeeof any objections they may have.(3) Instructs the Committee on Economic Questions to submit a definitivedraft in the course of the next session.
Report of the Legal and Administrative Committee on Nationality Laws and a european Passport56. On 8th September the Assembly considered a report of the Legal andAdministrative Committee on the progressive unification of the law of member states with respect to the legal status of foreigners, with the ultimate object of creating a common European nationality and a European passport (an item onthe Assembly&apos;s Agenda which had been referred direct to the Committee without prior general debate in the Assembly).57. The following is a summary of the report, which was approvedunanimously without debate : (1) The question of a common European nationality is referred for studyby the Standing Committee of the Assembly or any other committeewhich the Standing Committee may suggest.(2) The Assembly recommends to the Committee of Ministers that each member State should ensure that the question of a European passportshould be studied by its appropriate Department of State.Report of the Legal and Administrative Committee on Refugees58. On 8th September the Assembly considered a report by the Legal andAdministrative Committee on the question of European Refugees, a subject whichhad been raised in connexion with the general question of European human rights.59.   The following is a summary of the Report as approved : The Assembly instructs the Secretariat (i) to collect all necessary data on the question of European refugees andto this end to establish contacts with U.N.O. and the various Govern-ments and private institutions concerned;(ii) to investigate the following questions: the juridical status of displaced persons, the re-employment in Europe or emigration of displaced persons, the disposal of &quot; hard core &quot; displaced persons, and whether any part of the field is not covered by the work of existing organisations.Close of the Session60. The Session of the Assembly was closed at 12-30 p.m. on Friday,9th September, by a moving speech by the President, in which he reviewed the achievements of the Assembly, expressing the strong conviction that the Assemblyhad every reason to congratulate itself on its labours. He thought that the experiment had been worth while and that it was indeed possible to create a parliament of Europe. Referring to the presence of the Chairman of the Com-mittee of Ministers, he spoke of the close co-operation between the Committee ofMinisters and the Assembly and the responsibility which the Assembly had shownin its debates and recommendations.First Meeting of the Standing Committee and transmission of recommendations to the Committee of Ministers61. On 8th September the Assembly approved a proposal by the Bureauthat the Standing Committee, set up in accordance with the proposals of theGeneral Affairs Committee, should consist of the President, the. four vice-presidents and 23 other representatives. The United Kingdom representatives on this Committee are Lord Layton (as a Vice-President), Mr. Crawley, Mr. Lee,and Sir D. Maxwell Fyfe.62. The Committee held its first meeting on 9th September and approvedproposals made by the President for submitting the resolutions of the Assembly,and the future budgetary arrangements for the Assembly, to the Chairman of theCommittee of Ministers. The Committee also made it clear that it should consist-ordinate and keep in close touch with the activities of the other committeesand sub-committees set up by the Assembly, which should not meet without theStanding Committee&apos;s agreement. This control would, however, be administra-tive and would not cover the work of the Committees. The next meeting of theCommittee is to be immediately after the next meeting of the Committee of
Ministers. A copy of the letter of 9th September from the President to theChairman of the Committee of Ministers transmitting the Assembly&apos;s recom-mendations and resolutions is attached at Appendix A.Y. General Points concerning the Work of the Assembly as Transmitted tothe Committee of Ministers and Position under the Statute63. The reports of the various Committees, as approved by the Assembly,consist of preambles, resolutions for internal action by the Assembly, andrecommendations to the Committee of Ministers for action, except in certain caseswhere a Committee has not found it necessary to report in more than one of these three ways, usually by resolution for internal action. In almost all cases whererecommendations are made to the Committee of Ministers, the Assembly asks fora report on the action taken. The Committee of Ministers will presumably becalled on to express an opinion and take action only on the recommendations madeto it by the Assembly, and not on the preambles or resolutions for internal actionin the Assembly, which are sent to it for information. Since, however, a numberof the resolutions for internal action deal with the establishment of committees to work between Sessions, the Committee of Ministers will be asked to make available any necessary extra funds over and above the existing budget(Article 38 (d) of the statute).64. It may be relevant to recall that the Committee of Ministers can take action under the Statute in two ways : (a) Under Article 15 (a) of the Statute they may reach &quot; conclusions &quot; whichare communicated as such to member Governments and require a two-thirds majority of the Committee.(b) Under Article 15 (b) of the Statute they may make &quot; recommendations &quot;to member Governments with the additional possibility of requestingeach member Government to inform the Committee of the action taken;such recommendations require a unanimous vote.This distinction, while being largely a matter of form and laid down in-order to secure agreement in the last stages of drafting the Statute, has somesubstance in that the &quot; recommendations &quot; are a stronger form of action thanthe &apos;&apos; conclusions.&apos;&apos;65. In dealing with the Assembly&apos;s recommendations the Committee ofMinisters may therefore either (a) decide to take no action at all and report the fact to the Assembly (see below), or(b) &quot; reach conclusions &quot; under Article 15 (a) of the Statute, or(c) make &quot;recommendations&quot; under Article 15 (b) of the Statute, or(d) decide to take some alternative action to that proposed in the Assembly&apos;srecommendations, either on their own authority or after reference tothe Assembly : this decision would require either a two-thirds majorityor a unanimous vote according to whether the action falls under15 (a) or Article 15 (b) of the Statute.The Committee&apos;s proposals, or report on the action taken, will presumably be embodied in a report to the Assembly under Article 19 of the Statute. This report will have to be unanimous under Article 20 (a) (ii) of the Statute, but there is nothing to prevent the Committee deciding unanimously to report a dividedopinion, undesirable as that would be. On the great majority of the reoommenda-tions put forward, it is not of course necessary for the Committee of Ministers toreach final decisions at their meeting in November. In most cases a final decision is not required till a report has to be prepared for the Assembly either at an extraordinary session (if one is approved) or at the next ordinary session in ayear&apos;s time.66. The second general point is that the Assembly did not have time to givemuch thought to the form in which its various reports are presented, or to makemuch attempt to co-ordinate them. This is shown particularly in the different ways in which the Assembly suggest that action should be pursued. For instance somereports recommend that subjects should be studied and action taken on a Govern-menfal level by the Committee of Ministers, others intend the Committees of the
Assembly to continue their studies (in some cases concurrently with Governmentalaction) on a non-governmental level, while some instruct the Secretariat to makestudies. This state of affairs will clearly improve when the Standing committee set up by the Assembly to co-ordinate the work of the Assembly gets into its strideunder the chairmanship of the President of the Assembly. It is a problem chieflyfor the Assembly itself to tackle, but the Committee of Ministers may well beable to guide its decisions.VI. General Assessment67. Given the vague conception of the Assembly&apos;s functions and the grave difficulties with which it was faced, the Assembly may be said in fact to have ful-filled many of the more modest hopes which could reasonably have been placed init and to have avoided some of the likely pitfalls.68. When the Council met, it had only the Statute to guide it on the relation-ship between its two organs. This document laid down that the Assembly shouldbe a consultative body with fairly closely circumscribed powers. This was inevitable, since it would have been, and still is, impossible to give it wide powerswithout deliberate decisions of the responsible Parliaments of the countries con-cerned, based on the views of their national electorates. At the same time theStatute was by design a flexible document susceptible of amendment in the lightof developments. The individual representatives of the Assembly when arriving at Strasbourg may have had their own ideas how the Assembly would work withinthe stipulations of the Statute, but they only had the barest indications whetheror not these views were shared by others; It is, therefore, hardly surprising thatthe end of the Assembly still found this problem unsolved, although solid work had been done on it and plans laid for its further consideration in future, includ-ing recommendations from the Assembly for the amendment of the Statute tostrengthen its own position.69. The difficulties confronting the Council, and in particular the Consul-tatiye Assembly, were sufficient to make some people wonder whether it wouldfunction at all. The individual representatives, a certain number of internationalfigures apart, did not know one another personally and had never worked together.There were two official languages, but seven of the twelve countries representedhad neither of these as their mother tongue. There was no strictly party line of demarcation between the representatives, (though broad party divisions did mani-fest themselves from time to time), and there was a danger that national viewswould colour each representative&apos;^ action. In addition the representatives onlyreceived their provisional rules of procedure just before the meeting; in theabsence of a Leader of the House or a Government Front Bench, there was no authority to guide or organise their work; and they did not know who theirPresident was to be. On the other hand the Council started with the great advant-age that all concerned wished it to succeed, even if their ideas how success shouldbe achieved were very different. There was no purely negative element, like thepresence of the Soviet Union in so many other international organisations.70. In the relationship between the Committee of Ministers and theAssembly there had been widespread, but largely artificially inspired, fears thatantagonism would arise from the start. This was belied in the event, and it canbe said that the comparative moderation shown by the Assembly and the tactand flexibility shown by the Committee of Ministers in agreeing that the Assemblymight discuss all the matters which it wished to place upon its agenda have paid a good dividend.71. The Assembly itself began, even in this first session, to develop aco-operative parliamentary personality. National points of view in the main tooksecond place to what may be described as a European point of view, in howevermany different forms that may have been expressed. This co-operative parliamen-tary personality, which should grow still further if the recommendation to abolishsubstitutes is approved, showed itself not only in the almost unanimous opinionof representatives that the Assembly&apos;s powers vis-a-vis the Committee ofMinisters should be increased, but also in the development of the Assembly&apos;sown methods of procedure and debate.   At first there was a tendency towards
set speeches; this rapidly developed, however, into a debating procedure of muchcloser cohesion, with argument centering round the particular point before theAssembly at any given moment. As was perhaps natural, the Assembly tended tocarry out its work more on the lines of continental than&apos; English parliamentarypractice. Nevertheless, certain important fundamental points have been taken from the British tradition such, for instance, as the fact that the representativesspeak from their places and address the Chair. The Assembly in addition provedwilling to learn from the British tradition in the matter of its privileges, and showed commendable independence in resisting any too blatant interference bythe European Movement.72. Little of this would have been possible had it not been for the excellenceof M. Spaak as President of the Assembly. His personal qualifications, his knowledge of the English and French languages and of almost all existing inter-national organisations, as well as his own parliamentary position, made him the ideal, and indeed the only, candidate for this post. Some may have found thathe was too dictatorial or that, instead of following a fixed procedure, he tended to improvise to meet the needs of the moment. But there is no doubt that withouthim the Assembly would have proceeded with its work in a very much less orderlyfashion and with much greater delay, if indeed it had functioned at all.73. If it is remembered that the recommendations are not the pronounce-ments of a parliament with power to see that its decisions are executed, andwith the sense of responsibility which such power brings with it, nor even thework of a representative organisation, the results of the work of the Assemblymust clearly command respect. When the Standing Committee established bythe Assembly has got into its stride some of the present deficiencies may wellbe corrected. In the meantime the present session has shown that, although still very much in the formative stage, the Assembly is a live force which can even now focus public opinion and direct some useful criticism towards governments and existing Governmental international organisations. It is therefore not without some reason that, in the Press conferences held by leading representatives at the close of the Session and by the Press of the majority of the countries represented, the Council was held to have made a successful start, in the Taceof many initial uncertainties and difficulties, in this experimental form of theconduct of international relations.APPENDIX ALetter from President of Consultative Assembly to Chairman ofCommittee of Ministers transmitting Recommendations and Resolu-tions of the assemblyCouncil of Europe,9th September, 1949Your Excellency,I have the honour to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Committeeof Ministers of the Council of Europe, the texts of the Reports adopted by the consultative Assembly during the course of the Session which closed on 8th September, 1949.The Assembly referred the various items on its Agenda to six Committees : (1) Committee on Rules of Procedure.(2) Committee on General Affairs.(3) Committee on Economic Questions.(4) Committee on Cultural Questions.(5) Committee on Social Questions.(6) Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions.Each of these Committees has submitted one or more reports containingrecommendations to the Committee of Ministers.
17323The Committee on General Affairs has proposed, and the Assembly has approved, the setting up of a Standing Committee of the Assembly for the co-9ordination of the work of the Assembly and its Committees.   The committees have also drawn up their programmes of work to be done before the next Session.I will comment briefly on the above-mentioned documents in this order.The Chairman,The Committee of Ministers of theCouncil of Europe.I. Recommendations to the Committee of Ministers(a) Proposed amendments to the Statute. These proposals are to be foundin Part III of Document 87.With regard to Articles 4 and 5, the Consultative Assembly requests that itmay be consulted on the admission of new Members and new associate members to the Council of Europe.A modification of Article 23 is suggested, whereby the Assembly would beempowered to fix its own Agenda independently of the Committee of Ministers.It is also proposed that the system of Substitutes should be abolished and thatthe number of representatives should be doubled (Articles 25 and 26).With regard to the Secretariat-General, there is a recommendation that twoDeputy Secretaries-General be appointed, under the authority of the Secretary-General, one responsible for the Secretariat of the Committee of Ministers, andone for the Secretariat of the Consultative Assembly.The modifications proposed call for certain changes in other Articles of theStatute, some of which are already mentioned in Part III, B, of Document 87.It will, in any case, be necessary to examine the Statute as a whole to see whereother consequential modifications are necessary.(&amp;) The Assembly requests the Committee of Ministers to examine the2uestion of the admission of new Members and of new A ssociate Members to thelouncil of Europe and to include this question in the Agenda of the next ordinaryor extraordinary Session of the Assembly (Part III, C, of Document 87).It seems clear from the Assembly&apos;s debates that this recommendationenvisages more particularly the possibility of the admission of Western Germany,but it also affects the Sarre and Austria.(c) Document 71 (Parts I and II) describes the economic questions whichthe Assembly requests the Committee of Ministers to examine.The Assembly has particularly emphasised the necessity of impressing the gravity of the present situation upon the peoples of Europe by all possible information media.These recommendations are directed towards the establishment of a systemof multilateral payments, including the re-establishment of the convertibility ofEuropean currencies, the creation of a permanent body responsible for theco-ordination of credit policy, the development of the work started by the O.E.E.C.for the promotion of inter-European trade and for the study of economic relationsbetween European and associated countries and territories, the preparation of a european Economic Union- by maintaining and developing existing preferentialsystems, the study of the development of production in Member States with theobject of satisfying mutual requirements as regards imports, the movement ofpersons, the investment of foreign capital, the extension of a system of guaranteedmarkets, the calling of an economic conference and of industrial conferences inwhich employers, workers and consumers would be represented with the object of organising the industries concerned and of increasing their productivity, and thepreparation of a convention for the control of international cartels.The Assembly hopes that the Committee of Ministers will agree to submitits proposals, based on these recommendations, to the next Session of the Assembly,in order that the Council of Europe, as soon as these proposals have been accepted,by the Assembly, may enter into negotiations with the Government of the UnitedStates and with any&apos;other interested Government (Part II, a: b :).The Assembly also asks the Committee of Ministers to let the StandingCommittee know, as soon as possible, through the intermediary of the Presidentof the Assembly, of any objections that might in due course be made to the creationof a European Patents Office (Document 110).37682 d
(d) With regard to cultural affairs (the whole of Document 101), the AssemblyJaas submitted a number of recommendations to the Committee of Ministersconcerning cultural agreements, the free circulation and exchange of publications,co-operation in scientific research and assistance to cultural organisations. Itfurther suggests that the Ministers of Education of Member States, assisted bythe university authorities, should draw up together a plan of cultural co-operation on a European basis, the broad lines of which are given. It is suggested that thequestion of the creation of a European University ought to be discussed duringthe next Session. The institution of a European Cultural Centre is also proposed and the objects of such a Centre are set out.(e) As regards social questions, the Assembly recommends (Document 79 Part 1) to Member States the reform of their respective systems of social legisla-tion with the view of achieving, by the methods appropriate to each country, acommon standard of social security, of studying the possibility of a generalratification of international social security conventions and of drawing up a multilateral agreement on social security.(/) The safeguarding and development of human rights and the fundamentalfreedoms. The steps to be taken for the achievement of the declared object of theCouncil of Europe, in Article I of the Statute, are dealt with in Document 108.In this connexion the Assembly recommends to the Committee of ministers that it should prepare as soon as possible a draft convention of collectiveguarantees which would assure to all persons residing in the territories of member states the effective enjoyment of the fundamental rights and freedoms which are set out in Article 2 of Part I of the Universal Declaration on Human Rightsadopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations. The Assembly has submitted to the Committee of Ministers a draft of suggested Articles for theproposed convention.The Assembly wishes to recommend to the Committee of Ministers that theCommittee does everything possible to ensure that each Member State takes thenecessary action to see that the question of a European passport be studied by theappropriate Ministerial authorities. -Finally, the Standing Committee of the Assembly which met this morninghas expressed the desire that the replies from the Committee of Ministers to the-recommendations transmitted to it should be communicated to the Assembly as andwhen decisions are taken on them.The above are the recommendations which I have the honour to transmit toyou on behalf of the Assembly, in accordance with Article 23 of the Statute.II. Organisational problems the Assembly has discussed the question of the organisation of the work ofits Committee in the interval between sessions.(a) It was felt, as a result of the study undertaken by the Committee on general Affairs, that a Standing Committee should be set up (Part II, Docu-ment 87) which should be responsible for the co-ordination of the resolutions ofthe Assembly and of the reports and recommendations of its Committees, for thepreparation of the work of the next session and for the adoption of any measurescalculated to facilitate and accelerate its work.This Standing Committee will be composed of the President, the four Vice-Presidents and twenty-three representatives to the Assembly. The chairman ofthe six Committees will be ex officio members.The Committee will meet at least four times each year and whenever thePresident of the Assembly shall consider it&apos; necessary. The President of theAssembly, on behalf of the Standing Committee, will consult with the Committeeof Ministers on the desirability of calling at any time an extraordinary session ofthe Assembly, or in connexion with any matter arising out of the agenda of theprevious session.(b) The Assembly has decided further that the six Committees appointed by it might meet in the interval between sessions. In general, the Committees, withthe approval of the Assembly, have assigned themselves the task of continuingduring the coming months, the study of the questions referred to them.(c) the development of the work of the Committees of the Assembly entailscertain expenditure not originally included in the budget approved by the Com-mittee of Ministers.   This matter is taken up in the Report of the Committee on
General Affairs which has been approved by the Assembly (paragraph 3 of Part iv of Document 87), but only in so far as that particular Committee is concerned.Ill-Programmes of Work of the Committees of the AssemblyBefore separating, most of the Committees drew up, in broad outline, their programmes of work up to the next session of the Assembly.(a) The Standing Committee of the assembly in addition to its general tasks as outlined above, the Standing Committee ofthe Assembly is charged by the Committee on General Affairs with the study ofa resolution recommending, to the Committee of Ministers the systematic instruc-tion of the masses concerning the undeniable advantages of European unity(paragraph 4, Part IV, Document 87).(b) Committee on Rules of procedure Committee on Rules of Procedure was unable to complete the verydetailed work entailed in the transformation of the Provisional Rules into thefinal Rules of Procedure. The Committee has therefore proposed, and theAssembly has approved, the setting up of a Sub-Committee of six members withthe task of establishing, by such means as may be necessary, a draft of the finalRules of Procedure to be submitted to the Assembly (Document 100).(c) Committee on General AffairsPart I of Document 87 sets out the task of the Committee on General Affairs.This Committee, after having examined the general position of the Member States,the present situation as regards existing inter-governmental organisations andthe proposals for the establishment of closer collaboration in the economic, social and cultural fields, has undertaken to study the changes in the political and con-stitutional structure of Member States which may be necessary in order to ensuresuch closer collaboration, proposals for federation and so forth, and the effects which changes of this kind would have in each Member State. The Assembly hascharged the Committee to formulate clear-cut proposals and to , report to thePresident in time for the Session of 1950, so that members of the Council ofEurope should be in a position to submit the recommendations adopted as soon aspossible for discussion by their respective Parliaments.The Assembly has also instructed its Committee on General Affairs to draft a European agreement defining the guiding principles of the Council of europe and forestalling possible conflicts between participating countries by confirmingtheir intention to outlaw war (paragraph 7, Part IV, Document 87).The same Committee will also examine two draft amendments to the Statutewhich would provide for any case where the Committee of Ministers might feelitself unable to take into consideration the recommendations of the consultative assembly (paragraph 6, Part IV, Document 87).(d) Committee on Economic questions the Committee on Economic Questions has set out the general plan of its work (Part III, Document 71 and annexes). It has provided for the setting upof four sub-committees, each with its own programmes of work. This Committeehas proposed, and the Assembly has approved, that the President of the assembly should establish contact with the Secretaries of the United Nations, the O.E.E.C.and the B.I.S. with the object of gaining access to the publications Of these bodies and of allowing Committees to hear the views of the national and internationalexperts of these different organisations.(e) Committee on Cidtural questions the Report of the Committee on Cultural Questions only contains recommen-dations to the Committee of Ministers.(/) Committee on Social questions the Committee on Social Questions has decided to continue its work on social security and to study itself the questions of- the housing and emigrationof workers (Parts II and III of Document 79).37682 d 2
IV. Conclusions(1) Establishment of a European Political authority the Assembly, by adopting paragraphs 5 and 8 of Part IV of Document 87,has shown that it considers one of its aims and objects to be the establishment ofa European political authority with limited functions but real powers. Thisquestion has been referred to the Standing Committee.(2) Convocation of an Extraordinary session the Assembly considers that it would be right to meet in extraordinary session in the early part of 1950. The Standing Committee will take the necessary stepsat the appropriate moment.The Assembly has also resolved that if its members decide by a simple majority vote to ask the President to call a special session, the President shallcommunicate with the Committee of Ministers on this matter (paragraphs 1 and 2of Part IV of Document 87).(3) Reports of the Committee of MinistersFinally, the Assembly has requested that Reports of the Committee ofMinisters, as provided for in Article 19 of the Statute, shall be as detailed aspossible and shall contain clearly defined proposals on the various questions trans-mitted by the Committee to the Assembly for an opinion. This recommendation is the result of the feeling of uncertainty which pervaded the Assembly at thebeginning of the session, when it was faced with requests for opinions which,by reasons of the short notice given for the convening of the Assembly, it had proved impossible to formulate very clearly. The Assembly attaches the greatest importance to receiving detailed and complete reports from the Committee ofMinisters, in accordance with Article 19 of the Statute.It would appear that, in general, these Reports should be the first item onthe Agenda of the Assembly at each session. They will facilitate the establishmentof confident relations between the two organs of the Council of Europe. TheAssembly is convinced that it is expressing the sentiments of the Committee ofMinisters also, when it affirms that the continuance of the confident relationship which has marked this first session of the Council is a vital necessity for the futureof the organisation.I have the honour to be.
