&quot;HIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS government confidential // [ \S    ; ,    \:  Copy Noi-3 1CP, (49) 171      l;q:- 0^S^Mf^8th August, 1949 ,cabinet internation NORTH-WEST ATLANTIC FISHERIESCONVENTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries :   .In,accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on 17th.January (CM. (49)^4th Conclusions, Minute 4), the United Kingdom was. represented at the Inter-national North-West Atlantic Fisheries Conference convened by, the UnitedStates Government which opened in Washington on 26th January. At the finalmeeting of the Conference on .8th February the British delegates signed the FinalAct of the Conference and a North-West Atlantic. Fisheries Convention. TheFinal Act and the Convention have been published in Crhd. 7658, acopyof whichis annexed/ &apos;;&apos;&apos;&quot;&apos; &apos;.&apos;\, &quot;    &apos;.&apos;       .;&apos;; \ /f^,&apos;. X&apos;.2. The Convention provides for the setting up of an Commission for the-purpose of the investigation, protection, and conservation ofthe fisheries in theareas defined in Article I.3.   The Commission, with headquarters in North America,: at a place yet to.be decided, will be composed of not more than three Commissioners appointedby each of the contracting Governments, assisted by experts, and advisers.   Apermanent Secretariat will be appoihtea and will be headed by ah&apos; Executive-Secretary. -     1 1 - 1&apos; -c, 4. The Convention area,is to he. divided/into,five sub-areas with a Panelfor each.&apos; The members of each Panel will represent the countries with coastlinecontiguous to. the panel area, or with substantial fishery/interests, therein. TheUnited Kingdom is represented on&apos;the panels for sub-areas 1 (West Greenland)and 3^ (Newfoundland), which are of actual or potential importance to the british fishing industry. &apos; ) &apos;&apos;     &apos;5;The Commission will&apos; be responsible for the scientific investigation of the fisheries in the Convention area and for obtaining and collating-the informationnecessary for maintaining stocks of fish. Article VI of the Convention specificallyprovides for the Commission&apos;s investigations,being carried out through the agency of the contracting Governments or other public or private bodies. The object ofthis provision isitb^iavoid!the establishment of a;new research organisation (whichcould only draw&apos;upon the scientists of the&apos; participating I countries) and to limitdollar expenditure.&apos;   , - - nil In mid      -&apos;.- j-yy\6. The Commission is also empowered, on the basis of scientific information and on the recommendation of a Panel,-to make proposals to the contracting-Governments for joint action by those Governments designed to conserve stocksof fish. These proposals may deal with such matters as the fixing of open and close seasons, plosing spawning grounds to fishing, fixing size limits, and limits to-the over-all catch, of any species of fish, and prescribing types of gear which maybe used.Any such proposals do not take effect unless agreed to by all the governments represented on the Panel for the sub-area in ^question; they then become binding on all participating Governments and each Government is responsible for theirenforcement in respect of its own nationals.The Commission may also put forward proposals affecting the area as a wholeafter consultation with all the Panels and a similar procedure applies to anysuch proposals.37405
L: &quot; f 7.   It will be seen that the proposals originally put forward by the UnitedStates Government that the Commission should be endowed with powers of regu-lating the fisheries of the North-West Atlantic were drastically altered by theConference and that neither the Commission nor any of the Panels will have anyregulatory functions. The only regulatory action which can be taken under theConvention depends on the agreement of those Governments represented on the panel concerned (or if it affects the whole area, of all the participating Govern-ments). This procedure may involve the surrender of some rights by governments which are not represented on the Panel for a sub-area; no difficulty should arise in practice, however, as each Panel will include representatives from the Govern-ment of every country with any substantial interest in that area.8. Article X provides for full co-operation with other international bodiessuch as the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the Food and agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and other public or privateagencies with related interests. .   , .  ,   ,   ai. i., ,9. The Conventioii^whioh waa ratified by the United Sfeatca Government onI7n- rrwa,^rH9Ui May, 1040/ comes into force when it has been ratified by four signatory&apos; Governments and is to remain in force for ten years from that date. Govern-ments which do not ratify before that date may do so subsequently and theConvention is not binding upon them until they do so. Provision is made forthe adherence of other Governments which did not participate in the Conference;during the period of operation of the Convention any Government may withdrawby giving one year&apos;s notice.10. British fishing vessels already operate in the Greenland sub-area andhave very great potential interest in the Newfoundland sub-area, which includes the Newfoundland Banks, and we believe British interests will best be protectedthrough. participation in the proposed Commission, which provides a usefulinstrument for keeping under review the fisheries in the area concerned and for establishing the scientific facts on which any necessary action to conserve thosefisheries can be taken.11.   We recommend, therefore, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should (1) Accept the recommendations contained in the Final Act;(2) Ratify the Convention.This will involve the acceptance of the following obligations : (a) The payment of expenses of representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment on the Commission.(6) The pro rata payment in United States dollars of the expenditure of theCommission. Article IX provides that each Government shall paytowards the administrative expenditure 500 United States dollarsglus a contribution based on the number of Panels on which thatrovernment is represented. The Conference estimated that during its first year the probable cost of the Commission would be 40,000 dollars;on this basis the United Kingdom contribution to the administrative expenses would be about 1,000 United States dollars.(c) The transmission to the Commission of statistical information relating tothe current conditions and trends of the fishery resources of the North-West Atlantic Ocean.(d) Taking any legislative or other action required to enforce in respect ofBritish nationals proposals for the conservation of fish stocks whichbecome effective under the provisions of the Convention.A.

Schuck, Secretary.The final session was held on 8th February 1949.As a result of the deliberations of the Conference the International Con-vention for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries (hereinafter referred to as theConvention) was formulated and opened for signature on 8th February, 1949,to remain open for signature for fourteen days thereafter.The following resolutions and recommendations were adopted and thefollowing statements were received : IThe International Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Conference resolves:I. To express its gratitude to the President of the United States ofAmerica, Harry S. Truman, for his initiative in convening the present conference and for its preparation;
2. To express to its Chairman, W. M. Chapman, and its Vice-Chairman,Klaus Sunnanaa, its deep appreciation for the admirable manner in whichthey have guided the Conference and brought it to a successful conclusion;3. To express to the officers and staff of the Secretariat its appreciationfor their untiring services and diligent efforts in contributing to the fruitionof the purposes and objectives of the Conference.IIThe International Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Conference resolves:That the Government of the United States of America be authorised to publish the Final Act of this Conference, the text of the Convention, and tomake available for publication such additional documents in connection withthe work of this Conference as in its judgment may be considered in the publicinterest.bill the International Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Conference recommends:That in establishing and maintaining the International Northwest atlantic fisheries Commission the Contracting Governments give careful considerationto the following conclusions reached at the Conference:  1. finance the probable cost of the Commission during its first year would bein the region of 40,000 dollars.This estimate is to some extent based upon the present expenditure incurred by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, butit must be recognised that the cost of that organisation cannot be used as an accurate guide to the possible cost of the new Commission on accountof the rather specific and long-standing nature of its set-up. The preciseamount would necessarily depend upon various considerations such as the location and cost of the office of the Commission for which certain facilitiesmight be available either in the United States or in Canada.2. Staff(1) It is desirable that the Executive Secretary of the commission should be a biologist. At the same time it is still more important thathe should be a man with great administrative and statistical ability. Itshould also be understood that after the Commission had begun to functionnormally it would probably be necessary at an early date to increase thestaff by the addition of, for example, a statistician.(2) The responsibilities of the staff of the Commission shall beexclusively international in character and they shall not seek or receiveinstructions in regard to the discharge of their functions from any authorityexternal to the Commission. The Contracting Governments should fullyrespect the international character of the responsibilities of the staff andnot seek to influence any of their nationals in the discharge of suchresponsibilities.3. Scientific Investigation(1) In the field of scientific investigations the Commission should be primarily responsible for: (a) arrangement for and co-ordination of work by agencies, and (b) establishment of working relationships with inter-national agencies. It is important, for the purposes of the Convention,that enlarged and co-ordinated scientific investigations should be carriedout and such investigations in so far as possible should be conducted by
agencies of the Contracting Governments or by public or private agencies(e.g., universities or private marine research laboratories). If investigationsnecessary to the purposes of the Convention cannot be arranged throughexisting Government, public, or private agencies, they should bt under- $taken by the Commission, but only in accordance with approved budgets.It is not contemplated that any such investigations conducted by Corn-mission personnel or equipment would include field operations.(2) The need for thorough consideration of the problems facing theCommission is paramount, and considerable time will be needed forassembling the material required for a determination of those problems.An informal interim committee of biologists might well be asked to assemble such material in advance of the coming into effect of the Con-vention, and the Government of Canada might take the initial measuresto this end.4. StatisticsIt is important, for purposes of the Convention, that improved statistics of the commercial fisheries in the Convention area should be collected andthe Commission should have responsibility for the compilation and distri-bution of the fishery statistics furnished by the Contracting governments in such form and at such times as the Commission may require.iv the International Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Conference requests:That as soon as possible after entry into force of the International Con-vention for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries the Depository Governmentinitiate steps for the holding of the first meeting of the International Corn-mission for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries at some place in North America,without prejudice, however, to the determination of the ultimate location ofthe seat of the Commission.VThe International Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Conference received:The following joint statement from the French and Spanish Delegations:  &quot; In the course of the Conference the French and Spanish Delegationshave requested that the definition of coastal limits in the Convention areabe put in said Convention.&quot; The Conference did not meet their request, considering that any discussion on this subject would lead to a definition of territorial waters and this matter was formally declared by the Conference out of itscompetence.&quot; The French and Spanish Delegations had to yield to the above decision.&quot; Consequently they cannot agree to paragraph 2 of Article I, which,in their innermost belief, is a meddling of the Conference in the aforesaidmatter.&quot;vi the International Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Conference records:That, the Italian Delegation, not having received from its Governmentspecific instructions on the text of paragraph 2 of Article I, as embodied inthe Second Interim Draft of the Convention, abstained from voting onacceptance of that paragraph.
In witness whereof the following representatives have signed this FinalAct.Done in Washington, this Eighth day of February, 1949, in the english language, the original of which shall be deposited with the Government of theUnited States of America. The Government of the United States of Americashall transmit certified copies thereof to all the other Governments represented at the Conference.Here follow the signatures in respect of:  Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom and the Government of Newfoundland inrespect of Newfoundland, Norway, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdomof Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America.Observers Here follow signatures in respect of: The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations andthe International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.CLARKE L. WILLARD,Secretary-General.36681c
