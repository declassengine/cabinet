THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. 92It is issued for the personal use top SECRET Copy No.CP. (k10) 19323RD SEPTEMBER. 1 9U9CABINETWAGES policy memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand, the Minister of Labour and National service the main purpose of the change in the value of sterling, viz. to increase the competitive power of our exportsby cheapening them to dollar buyers, will be frustrated ifthere is any serious rise in sterling costs here.     Wages arethe largest element in the costs of manufactured goods, and ifa cycle of wage increases started in consequence of the changein the value of sterling, it might in a short time nullify theoriginal purpose of that change.2. The situation -as regards wages was already dis-quieting before the decisions   announced on the 18th instant.There was unrest on wage matters among important bodies ofworkers and several large claims had been formulated and werein various stages of negotiation.     The change in the value of sterling, bringing with it a rise in the price of bread and flour and the possibility of other rises in the cost of livinglater, though they should not be serious, increases the diffi-culty of holding our present wages policy.     Yet the require-ments of the /time are such that not only must we hold that policy but v/e must make it more effective in the future than ithas been in the past.3. We feel that, subject only to the one exception asregards low-paid workers dealt with later in this memorandum, v/emust now do our utmost to secure that for some time there is atemporary standstill on wages.     This object, will not be easilyattained and it can only be secured &quot;by consent.      It cannot been forced.      It follows that there must be an appeal by theGovernment, couched, in the strongest and most urgent terms,addressed to employers and workers.      Such an appeal would haveno hope of a favourable response by&apos; the Trades Union movementunless the T.U.C. are ready to support it.     Equally essentialis the support of the employers.&apos;k. &apos; We think that the &quot;standstill11 should be for a periodof nine months, subject to the T. TJ. C. being able to ask for a review at the end of three months.      It must apply to allincreases of whatever kind which, but for the suspension, wouldbe granted or proposed after the 18th September, 1949* exceptincreases which have been the subject of agreement or of a formal award or announcement before that date although notcoming into effect until- afterwards.      In particular, it mustapply to increases awarded or recommended by statutory bodies,e.g. wages councils, industrial courts and arbitration tribunals,increases negotiated through the normal wage-fixing machinery.

5* It must also apply to increases payable under existing wages agreements which link wage movements with. movements in the cost-of-living index.     This particular classof case is one of special difficulty, as suspending theseautomatic wage increases involves, an agreement to vary existingwage agreements.     Wage agreements of this character cover some-2 million workers in important and widespread industries suchas building.      If these wages are allowed to rise automaticallyif the cost of living should increase, whether by reason of thechange in the value of sterling or for other reasons, it willbe difficult, if not impossible, to hold to a suspension of wage increases over the rest of the wages field.      Our sugges-tion is that the Government should request the representativesof the employers and workers concerned to agree to a temporary suspension of the operation of the agreements in the presentperiod of difficulty, or at least to eliminate that part ofany increase in the cost-of-living index due to devaluation.6. We think that the standstill should not include anygeneral escape clause, but if there were pressure for something of the kind, an arrangement might be made for a review in theevent of a substantial change in circumstances, but such review should not be linked with any specified rise in the cost-of-living index.7. We now examine how we can incorporate in a generalstandstill arrangements permitting consideration of proposalsfor wage increases for the lowest paid workers.8. In our view, the principles of the White Paper aselucidated in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s speech in theHouse of Commons on 12th February, 1948 (copy-of an extractabout low-paid workers annexed to this memorandum), should be strictly and strongly adhered to, with a fresh emphasis upon their urgent necessity to preserve the advantages and not towaste the sacrifices brought about by the alteration in exhange rates.      The White Paper and the Chancellor^ speechwould allow increases to the lowest paid workers in exceptional circumstances, but the strict application of the principles ofthe White Paper which we now advocate would clearly imply thatany increases permitted to such workers must not be made theground for increases all up the line.9. This is, of course, a matter of the greatest diffi-culty as it at once brings in the question of the wage-differentials between unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled workers.     Nevertheless we must insist that the present stateof our economy does not permit of overall increases of wagesthroughout industries.     The only legitimate case that can bemade is that in which it is shown that the present wage doesnot provide a decent minimum standard for the family-of the wage-earner.10. - The greatest problem is how to distinguish such casesfrom others and where to draw the line. &apos;    It was formerlysuggested that a national minimum wage might be introduced oracknowledged up to which wages could be brought.      This raisesquestions of great complexity and moreover in addition to thep-reat cost may set a standard for pensions, insurance payments,etc., which would prove ruinous.     We must, however, find some means by which, while avoiding the establishment of a national minimum wage, we secure that for a period&apos;of time all demands for increased wages are judged by this one criterion only andwe must arrange that such a limitation is introduced into allarbitral or other proceedings for wago increases.

If &quot;the T.U.O. would agree to such a provision it ispossible that we could proceed by agreement.      It might leadto a number of strikes but those we should have to fight- through and win; we could not afford to give way.12&apos; The precise manner in which to secure our objectiverequires careful consideration.      Clearly we must withoutdelay make an approach to the T. U. 0.  on the lines that for- aperiod of not less than nine months the only factor that is tobe taken into account in any negotiations or arbitrations for wage or salary advances is the question of whether the existingwage or salary provides the necessary minimum standard ofliving for the recipient and his family.13. As regards the method of adjudicating on claims forincreased wages, there seem to us to be two possibilities.The first possibility would be to mark the wholly exceptionalnature of the departures which it was intended to allow fromthe general standstill by arranging by agreement that any claims for increased wages in respect of these workers should bedecided not by the ordinary negotiating machinery of industry but by some machinery specially charged with that duty.      Ifthis principle is agreed, the Minister of Labour would proposeto consult his National Joint Advisory Council on the detailsof the proposal, including the Tribunal which might be used forthe purpose and the procedure to be followed in order to bringsuch claims before the Tribunal, and on the precise terms ofreference to secure that the Tribunal was not driven, as a con-dition of admission of claims for consideration, to laying down a general standard of adequate wages by which it would be guided. The second possibility is that discussions on wagesclaims should continue to be carried on through the existing machinery.     This method of giving effect to the policy has the disadvantage that, by leaving the determination of what consti-tutes an adequate wage to a large number of adjudicating ornegotiating bodies, there is unlikely to be any real uniformity in the criteria they adopt and disparities of standard between different industries and different parts of the country maymake the policy progressively more difficult to hold.      But ithas the advantage that it relies on existing machinery and thatthe disparities, if they are not such as to undermine thepolicy, are, in another way, a form of flexibility.     Forthese two reasons, this method has possibilities of longersurvival than a more rigorous approach such as would be secured by charging a special tribunal with the duty of determining theclaims now in question.15. We suggest that we should open negotiations with the    iT. U. C. with both these methods of approach in mind, with the       Iobjective of securing, either by one or the other, or in someother way, a method of procedure which will enable the generalstandstill on wages, subject only to exception for low-paid workers, to have the longest possible prospect of operationsubject to its being effective for its purpose.16. We feel, however, that if we are to insist - as wemust - upon the absolute and critical necessity of thisrestraint by the workers at the present time, we must make j.some gesture of sympathy which vail make them feel that they       iare not alone suffering while profit earners as a whole benefit Ias a result of the increased profits which there will undoubted-!ly be, in some cases as a result of the change in the value of    Isterling.      We doubt whether it is practicable to identifyprofitsJspecifically within this category and indeed whether itwould be wise to try, having regard to the need for maintaining the greatest possible inducements to secure dollar earnings.

But we think that it would not be unfair, taking profits as awhole, to require some general sacrifice out of profits, and wesuggest that the rate of profits tax on distributed profitsshould be moderately increased.     This change v/ould take effect as from 1st October- and any distribution of profits attributable to the period after that date v/ould bear the higher rate.     iisin the case of the increase of profits tax in the Autumn budget of two years ago, an appropriate safeguard would be included toprevent any avoidance of the intention of the clause in respectof the distribution of dividends after the 13th September.The intention to make this change v/ith effect from 1 st Octoberwould be announced immediately, but whether the necessary legis-lation would have to be undertaken in the near future or couldbe postponed, e. g. until next year&apos;s Budget,, requires further examination which is being undertaken immediately.17- It will be appreciated that the proposal to increasethe profits tax v/ill have to be mentioned to the T.U.C. when we meet them, i. e. before it has been announced in the House ofCommons.     This involves a risk of premature disclosure, whichwe must take, and v/ill almost certainly mean that v/e shall haveto go ahead with this proposal v/hether or not the response to theproposal for a standstill on wages (v/ith the exceptions mentionedin this paper) is satisfactory.R. S. 0.G. I.23rd September, 19^-9.AN18EXEXTRACT FROM SPEECH BY THE CHANCELLOR OF   1THE EXCHEQUER OH 12TH FEBRUARY,  19^8&quot;It may be that, even at the present time, someexceptional case exists where wage rates are not up to what might reasonably be regarded as a national subsistence levelowing to some very special time-lag in their adjustment.      Insuch a case, though it is difficult to imagine one, it v/ould bejustified from a national point of view to raise the wage level.It is not possible to state precisely what- thenational subsistence level is, but it must obviously be deter-mined by the levels of wages ruling at the bottom end of thescale at any given time.      Since, as I have said, we cannot afford any general increases of wages, it v/ould only be in some very special and particular case that such an increase could   1fall within the exceptions stated in the White Paper. 11
