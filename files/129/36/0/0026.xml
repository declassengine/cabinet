(49) 176ISth August, 1949CABINETOIL AND DOLLARSMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power in E.P.C. (49) 71 of 29th June I set out the dollar deficit expected to be incurred on oil for the whole of the sterling area in the fiscal year 1949-50 andexamined the possibilities of effecting economies in the various items. The Com-mittee agreed on 1st July that the issues raised in my paper should be discussed by officials before they were considered by Ministers (E.P.C. (49) 25th Meeting,Minute 2).2. A Working Party of officials had already been set-up as a result ofthe decision to make a comprehensive enquiry into the whole oil position (E.P.C.(49) 17th Meeting, Minute 2 (3) ), and subsequently this Working Party was askedto prepare a brief on oil for the forthcoming talks in Washington. It was accordingly decided to combine the preparation of this brief with the discussionof my earlier paper. I now attach as an Annex the Working Party&apos;s report, whichis also intended to serve as a brief for the Washington talks. Paragraphs 49-59of this report contain a summary of the conclusions.The problem. The Working Party have re-examined the estimates on which the calcula-tions made in E.P.C. (49) 71 were based. As a result, they expect that the dollar deficit on oil in 1949-50 will be 580 million dollars compared with the figure of600 million dollars given in my earlier paper. They have also estimated the dollar deficit for 1953, by which time the major part of the British oil companies&apos;expansion plans should have been completed. A year ago, it was thought that the dollar deficit in 1953 would be reduced to 359 million dolTars,* but it is now thoughtthat it will still be 500 million dollars. The main reason for this change for the worse in the forward estimates is the fall in oil prices (averaging 30 per cent, forrefined products and about 20 per cent, for crude oil) which nas occurred duringthe past year.In calculating this deficit it was assumed that the present restrictions onthe use of oil in this country would be maintained, except that the basic petrolration would be restored to the 1947 level of 270 miles motoring a month by 1953.It was also assumed that British companies would produce oil to the maximum extent that their physical resources would permit, and that the United states companies would maintain their present share of trade in the sterling area.* This represents the  55 million (222 million dollars) given in the table annexed to E.P.C. (48)72 plus 137 million dollars for sales to the Western Hemisphere countries which are no longer regardedas equivalent to dollar sales.37457 B
4. But on these assumptions it is also expected that the British companies will have a substantial oil &apos;&apos; surplus &apos;&apos; above what they require to meet theirsales in the sterling area and to third countries. The surplus in 1949-50 isestimated by the Working Party at no less than 4 million tons, most of whichis fuel oil, and in a few years&apos; time the surplus would be enough to enable all restrictions on consumption in the sterling area to be removed. Because of thenon-discrimination provisions of the Anglo-American Loan Agreement, however,we should not be able to consume this oil without at the same time buying aconsiderable additional amount of dollar oil and so increasing the dollar deficit.Alternatively, if oil consumption in the sterling area remains restricted thesesurpluses could be used to displace imports of dollar oil and so reduce the dollar deficit by amounts varying from 50 million dollars in 1949-50 to about 125 million dollars in 1952 onwards; but, again, action of this kind would almost certainly be regarded as an infringement of the non-discrimination obligations we have assumed.   This is the main problem on oil that we have to face.5. Our object must be to reduce the dollar deficit on oil as much as possiblewhile maintaining a reasonable standard of consumption in the sterling area and involving ourselves in as little trouble as possible with the American oil companies and the United States Government.The British Oil Companies&apos; Expansion programme. The Americans will probably suggest that we should cut back our oilexpansion programme and so avoid producing the &quot; surpluses&quot; referred to inparagraph 4. The American authorities are known to be anxious about whatthey feel to be an over-expansion in refinery capacity, particularly in Europe,and E.C.A. has for the time being refused to finance refinery expansion in Europebeyond an arbitrarily selected figure (see Annex, Appendix VIII). We embarked on our oil expansion programme for both strategic and economic reasons. Itwas designed to enable us to maintain and develop our share of world trade inoil so as to maintain our concessionary rights (i.e., our production of oil), todevelop an export for which there is an assured and expanding market in theinterest of our overall balance of payments and to reduce the dollar drain involvedin the present dependence of the United Kingdom and the rest of the sterling area on the dollar oil provided by American companies. It was originally con-templated that the dollar drain would be reduced not so much by reducing the purchases of dollar oil as by increasing the sales of sterling oil to dollar and hard currency countries. But, as I have, indicated in paragraph 3, owing to the fallin the price of oil and the quantity that can be sold, prospects for sales of sterlingoil for dollars in 1953 are not as good as was previously expected. We can onlyreduce the dollar drain, therefore, by substituting for dollar oil in the sterling area the increased production of sterling oil which our expansion programme(and especially the refinery programme) will provide.7. The Americans may argue that, since our own production of oil involves a substantial dollar cost, there is little benefit to be gained from displacing theiroil by ours. Although the dollar element in the cost of Anglo-Iranian production is low, it is very much higher in the case of the Shell Company&apos;s operations inSouth America. But this is precisely the area where on strategic grounds it is most important to maintain and expand British-controlled production of oil;moreover, the oil produced by Shell in South America is being sold in increasingquantities for dollars and other hard currencies in the United States and theWestern Hemisphere generally. And our balance of payments position will obviously benefit from the substitution of oil costing a proportion of dollars in place of oil imported into the sterling area by American companies, the whole cost df which has to be paid in dollars.8. I suggest, therefore, that we should resist firmly any suggestion by the americans that we should curtail the expansion of British oil companies&apos;production in order to guarantee to the Americans their present share in the increasing oil trade in the sterling area. At the same time, the British oil companies should do everything possible to reduce the dollar costs of theirexpansion programme. The Working Party consider (Annex, Section Hi-paragraphs 39-43) that a saving of the order of 50 million dollars in theexpenditure originally estimated for 1949-50 could be made without any reductionin oil production, and I shall certainly press the oil companies to do everything possible to achieve this saving.
The American Share of Trade in the Sterling Area9. If, however, we are to get the full benefit of the British oil companies&apos;expansion, we must take vigorous action to achieve a substantial reduction in the dollar cost of the American share of trade in the sterling area, since this accounts for 60 per cent, of the dollar deficit in, 1949-50 and 77 per cent, in 1953. ways of doing this are examined in Section It of the Annex (paragraphs 22-38).10. I fully agree with the conclusion (paragraph 24) that there would beno advantage to be gained by endeavouring to oust United States oil from the sterling area by a price war. In the first place, it is most unlikely to succeed-there is no evidence to suggest that we can permanently sell oil in the sterling area at an appreciably lower price than the Americans and as we sell so muchmore oil than we buy, the general reduction in prices that would result from aprice war would have a markedly adverse effect on our general balance of payments position.11. In view of this, discrimination against American imports of oil intothe sterling area is the only way of reducing the dollar cost of the American shareof trade without drastic curtailment of consumption, which is dealt with inparagraph 13 below. The Working Party examined. three possible ways ofdiscriminating.(a) By pegging American imports at the 1948 figure and using the&quot;unallocated surpluses&quot; of British companies to provide for thewhole of the increases in consumption in the sterling area which havebeen allowed for in the previous calculations. This is estimated to save at the annual rate of 20 million dollars in 1949-50 and 60 million dollars in 1953.(b) By reducing A merican imports to 90 per cent, of the 1948 figure. Thiswould save at the annual rate of 42 million dollars in 1949-50 and68 million dollars in 1953.(c) By reducing American imports to the full content of the British companies&apos;unallocated surpluses. This would save at the annual rate of 50 million dollars in 1949-50 and 116 million dollars in 1953.12. Method (a) would not absorb the whole of the potential surplus ofBritish Companies and the balance could be used to remove some of the restrictionson consumption in the sterling area without additional dollar cost. The Americanscould hardly maintain a serious resistance to this. Even they should appreciate that it is politically impossible for us to continue restrictions on the use of .oilindefinitely on the grounds that we cannot use the oil we produce ourselvesbecause, while non-discrimination is in force, we should have to allow a propor-tionate increase in imports of dollar oil which we cannot afford!Methods (b) and (c) will be more difficult to get the Americans to accept;for the American oil companies would find it difficult to secure other markets for the oil displaced and might have to cut back production. Moreover theAmerican oil imports into the United Kingdom are at present financed withE.R.P. dollars and any reduction in them might cause a corresponding cut inthe allocation of E.R.P. dollars. Proposals (5) and (c) would also add to thedifficulties in getting E.C.A. to finance a part of our refinery expansion pro-gramme; for the American oil companies will argue that American aid shouldnot be used to finance British companies in taking away their oil trade.Consumption in the Sterling Area13. Under a policy of non-discrimination, it is useless to try to save dollarsby cutting sterling area consumption; for to save 1 ton of dollar oil, consumption would have to be cut by 3J tons in the United Kingdom and 2\ tons in therest of the sterling area. There would also be no point in cutting consumption inaddition to pegging the level of American imports (method (a) above). For,once the level of American imports was settled, any cuts in consumption would merely fall on sterling oil. If, however, we were to pursue a fully discriminatorypolicy, any cuts in sterling area consumption would serve to increase british companies &quot; unallocated surpluses &quot; and so enable more dollar oil to be displaced.The Working Party are examining the extent to which further economies in consumption in !the United Kingdom and the rest of the sterling area are37457 B 2
possible (Annex, Appendices Yla and VI6) but it does not appear likely that thescope for economy is very great unless drastic cuts involving considerable political difficulties are imposed.14. I do not think that we need yet make up our mind which of the threemethods of reducing the American share of trade in the sterling area we shouldadvocate. The best course to adopt in the Washington talks seems to me to presentthe problem as we see it to the Americans, and try to get their agreement to our negotiating a solution with the American oil companies direct which, whilesecuring for us the dollar savings that we must have, will damage them as little as possible. Under this procedure we should not press the discussions on oil too far in Washington but would aim at securing a firm understanding that theprinciple of non-discrimination should not apply strictly to oil in the UnitedKingdom and the sterling area. The subsequent negotiations with the Americanoil companies, which are bound to be highly technical, should, I suggest, be con-ducted Dy the Treasury and my Department in London in close touch with theForeign Office and the American Embassy.Summary15.   I recommend: (a) That the British oil companies should be encouraged to proceed with theirrt i* ,1&apos; i t r*     * * . .the same time cutting the dollar cost of their 1949-50 operatingexpenses by 50 million dollars.(b) That we should, in the Washington talks, present our problem on oil tothe Americans, endeavour to obtain their agreement that the principleof non-discrimination should not apply strictly to oil in the sterling area and suggest that a solution to our problems that will damage theAmerican oil companies least should be sought by negotiations inLondon between the British Government and the American oil companies.I should hope that the outcome of the measures recommended above would bea reduction in our dollar deficit on oil in 1949-50 of the order of 70 million dollars.The Discussions in WashingtonH.

ANNEXOIL AND DOLLARSReport by a Working Party of OfficialsSection I. Introductory(i) The problem the Sterling Area is at present finding a net sum of nearly $600 million ayear on account of oil. This paper examines the ways by which this dollar draincan be reduced whilst, on the one hand, maintaining a satisfactory level of consumption within the Sterling Area of what is a basic and essential rawmaterial, and, on the other hand, arousing the least antagonism in the UnitedStates of America or in other countries who are dependent on oil supplies fromBritish-controlled companies.*(ii) The Trading background. British and United States oil companies are the main competitors in theinternational oil trade, a position that arises as a matter of history from the enterprise of British and American nationals. At one time certain of these companies came to an arrangement establishing their relative positions inparticular markets, but no such arrangement any longer exists. The international trade had, however, reached a certain degree of stability before the war and thevarious major companies had achieved relatively settled market positions. Duringthe war these relative positions were in most areas preserved on Governmentinitiative by the establishment of rigid pools, such as the Petroleum Board in theUnited Kingdom, or through more flexible arrangements which preserved thecompanies&apos; identities. The majority of these arrangements have continued inone form or another into the post-war period, but are gradually being eliminated.In the United Kingdom the Petroleum Board was dissolved in June 1948, but under the terms or the inter-company agreement which set up the PetroleumBoard, the companies maintained tneir existing share of trade for twelve months.Now the importing of oil is handled under normal import licensing procedure.3. As a result United States companies market oil in the Sterling Area inthe same way that the Shell Group and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.)both sell considerable quantities of oil to United States companies. Oil is, there-fore, a commodity that the Sterling Area buys from dollar sources at the sametime that British companies, in effect, export although geographically, their main production is outside the Sterling Area for dollars as well as for other currencies.4. Table I shows the physical requirements of petroleum products by the sterling Area in 1949-50 and 1953 and how far those requirements are expectedto be met by United States companies, and how far by British. It also shows the disposal of sterling oil to other markets. It is expressed in terms of refined products as far as the Sterling Area is concerned, but sales of crude are included as such in the tonnages of sales to other countries.5. For the United Kingdom requirements, the Ministry of Fuel and Powerhave provided estimates of consumption assuming the continuation of present restrictions except in the case of motor spirit as regards which it is assumed that by 1953 the basic ration for private motorists will have been restored to the 1947level. For the rest of the Sterling Area, the figures are derived from British and united States oil companies&apos; estimates and for foreign trade from british companies&apos; estimates.* The British-controlled companies, which are hereafter referred to as British companies, includefor balance of payments purposes the Shell/Royal Group.
6. The availabilities of British companies&apos; production are based on the implementation of their expansion schemes as presently notified to us but see section III. In particular, they assume that the Haifa refinery will, as seems probable, be reopened in January 1950, and that the present delay in O.E.E.C.approval to the European refinery programme will not adversely affect the dateof completion of present plans.TABLE I1949-50 1953Tons Tons       Tons       Tons000 000        000          000A.

Unallocated supplies        ............ 4,016 3,6797. The British companies&apos; unallocated supplies in Line E represent onlymarginal quantities and they will not be produced if the oil companies can findno profitable outlet for them. They include in 1949-50 relatively small quantitiesof aviation spirit, motor spirit, gas oil and bitumen, for which outlets wouldcertainly be found, but nearly 3 million tons of fuel oil for which no immediatemarket exists. In 1953 the position is reversed. The possibility of using these to reduce our dollar deficit on oil is discussed later (Section II).(iii) The Sterling Area Oil Balance of Payments8.   The Sterling Area dollar outgoings in oil arise from (a) imports of dollar oil by United States companies;(&amp;) purchases of dollar oil by British companies to meet their trading deficit;(c) the dollar element in the cost of producing so-called &quot; sterling &quot; oil arisinglargely from purchases of specialised American equipment and from local costs in countries whose currencies are the equivalent of dollars.Against these can be set-British companies&apos; earnings of dollars and the capitalcontributions by United States oil firms to projects in the Sterling Area.9. Table II compares estimates of the position in 1949-50 and 1953 on thebasis of prices as at April 1949. A more detailed statement for these yearsand for 1948 is contained in Appendix I.

In return for this dollar deficit the Sterling Area receives oil to thevalue of $1,072 million in 1949-50 and $1,262 million in 1953. Moreover theUnited Kingdom balance of payments should receive net (i.e., after deductinglocal expenditure) in sterling from the rest of the Sterling Area or in currencyother than dollars $458 million in 1949-50 and $665 million in 1953 as the net receipts from oil.II. Calculations made a year ago put the Sterling Area dollar deficit ona comparable basis at $621 million in 1949 and $359 million in 1953, whilst theUnited Kingdom was expected to receive $806 million from the rest of the Ster-ling Area and from non-dollar countries in 1949 and $1,044 million in 1953. Thereasons underlying the changed outlook are analysed in detail in Appendix IIIbut the main reason is the reduced value of oil sales. This is due to a com-,paratively small reduction in estimated volume of sales but primarily to the fallin oil prices. Since last summer the average price of petroleum products has fallen by 30 per cent., whilst the price of Middle East and Venezuelan crudes has fallen by 15-25 per cent, according to specification.12. On the other hand the local costs of production are increasing. InVenezuela this is offset by an expected reduction in taxation as gross profits fallaway from the high level of the immediate postwar years : but, as regards Persiaallowance has had to be made for an increased rate of royalty owing to the present negotiations.13. Nevertheless, the above figures may show a bias to pessimism. TheVenezuelan Oil interests are at present preparing a joint approach to theVenezuelan Government with a view to securing a revision of the royalty terms and they are not unhopeful of results since the Venezuelan Government is knownto be concerned about the possibility of increasing competition from middle east oil.14. As regards future movements of oil prices a general reduction is tothe disadvantage of the overall balance of payments, since we sell much moreoil than we buy. As far as dollars are concerned, there would be, at the moment,some advantage from a fall in oil prices, since the value of dollar imports of oilexceeds the value of sales for dollars by a margin (in terms of value) that is,however, expected to be insignificant in 1953. A general rise would, obviously,have the opposite effect. In fact, however, oil prices do not necessarily rise andfall as a whole. During the last year the relative movement in prices has been particularly damaging. Motor spirit prices have fallen by 10 per cent, only,while fuel oil prices have fallen by over 50 per cent. As we are net buyers of motor spirit for dollars and net sellers of fuel oil, this has seriously affected our dollar position.  For example, if motor spirit prices were to fall by 10 per cent.
and fuel oil prices were to rise by 10 per cent, the dollar balance of payments would benefit by $10 million whilst the non-dollar balance of payments would only show a loss of f 1 million.15. The general conclusion, therefore, is that on the whole forces already at work should lead to some improvement in the above picture of the Sterling Areadollar balance of payments (though not necessarily in the balance in other currencies), but that this improvement in the dollar balance will hot make any major change so far as we can forecast at the moment in the 1949-50 or 1953position.16-. This memorandum therefore examines the scope for positive action toreduce the dollar drain on oil not only in the context of the immediate dollarcrisis of 1949-50 but also with regard to long-term considerations.(iv) The Possibility of Increasing Dollar Receipts17. Everything possible is already being done to maximise sales for dollars,but, in view of the extraordinary swings that occur in the United States ofAmerica domestic oil position, it is not felt that it would be wise to assumehigher sales than those which have been taken in the estimates and of which infact about 80 per cent, are covered by contracts or are with purchasers with whomthe British selling companies have historical or financial connections. Last yeara more optimistic view was taken.18. The question of dollar invoicing of oil has been re-examined and foundto be unlikely to yield any substantial net gain to the dollar balance of payments as a whole (Appendix IV).19. It might also be possible to draw some immediate benefit by acceleratingthe drawings on the Shell Caribbean Loan (Appendix V). Any action of thiskind would aggravate our position in later years.(y) The Possibility of Reduced Dollar Expenditure20. Possible ways of reducing dollar expenditure on each item shown inTable II have been considered together with the probable repercussions of such reductions.   The courses that have been considered are: (a) Reducing the Cost of Dollar Imports by United States Companies1. Reduction of United Kingdom Consumption. Under present trading conditions of non-discrimination a cut in consumption only reduces UnitedStates companies&apos; dollar imports by the proportion of their share of trade which, overall, amounts to one ton in three and a half in the United Kingdomand one in two and a half in the rest of the Sterling Area. There is therefore no major dollar saving to be obtained from this method on its own. Further-more, any reduction of consumption in the United Kingdom would raiseconsiderable difficulties and there is no reason for thinking that oil is anyless an essential raw material to the rest of the Sterling Area (Appendix VI).2. Discrimination. It is possible, however, that to some extent dollaroil could be replaced by &apos;&apos; sterling &apos;&apos; oil now that British companies, owingto the expansion which they have already carried out, are likely to havesurpluses instead of the deficits which they have had to meet in the past bybuying from United States companies (see next paragraph). Apart fromthe remote possibility of ousting dollar oil by a price war, discrimination against United States companies is the only way of reducing dollar imports:A detailed examination of the scope and consequences of discrimination isset out in Section II, where it is also shown that a price war is not likely toimprove the dollar balance significantly and would have a serious effect onthe United Kingdom&apos;s earnings of other foreign currencies.(b) By Reducing British-Controlled Companies&apos; Purchases of Dollar OilThese purchases are already at a minimum and consist of oil boughtunder contract at a time of shortage, of crude oil bought as part of anarrangement whereby the resulting products are sold at a dollar profit or of specialised products which British-controlled companies do not produce all or in sufficient quantity (see Appendix II). In 1949-50 the possibility ofA.I.O.C. negotiating the earlier termination of their contract for thepurchase of motor spirit and gas oil is under consideration and may save
$3 million. In any case the dollar cost is expected to fall from $56 million to $16 million by i953.(c) By Redticing the Dollar Costs of Production and Expansion. This possibility is examined in paragraphs 39-43.(d)- By Reducing the Dollar Cost of Tanker Hire and FreightThis is examined in paragraphs 43-^46. &quot;.&quot;(e) By A ction in certain Special CasesThis is considered in detail in Appendix VIII. The special cases are :-1. Britmeos, an American-controlled bunkering company. Bydiscriminatory action some saving might be made in the coming year anduntil 1953, when it is estimated that almost its entire needs will be met by the production at Fawley.2. Bahrein Petroleum Company, an American-controlled companyrefining oil in the Sterling Area but operating largely on dollar crude.The substitution of sterling for dollar crude does not appear a practical proposition in the light of the considerations discussed in Appendix VII.The supplies by this company can, however, be treated as part of theAmerican companies&apos; dollar imports into the Sterling Area, and this isthe assumption adopted in Section II.21. It was clear that dollar savings on any significant scale could only beachieved by some form of limitation of American companies&apos; imports or by reducing the rate of dollar expenditure by British-controlled companies on production and expansion. These two possibilities are examined in the following sections.Section II. Replacement of United States Companies&apos; Imports of Dollar Oilinto the Sterling Area22. The f .o.b. cost of imports of dollar oil into the Sterling Area by UnitedStates companies is estimated to rise from $322 million in 1949-50 to $383 million in 1953* As pointed out in paragraph 20 (a) (1), so long as present trading conditions in the Sterling Area continue, a reduction in the dollar cost can onlybe obtained by a larger reduction in total imports, i.e., by reducing total consump-tion by the larger amount, United Kingdom and United States companies reducing their imports proportionally.23. This position might, of course, change from normal commercial develop-ments, but any major change is unlikely. Governmental action to produce anychange would involve discriminatory measures of some kind. It has never been settled exactly how far the non-discrimination provisions of the Loan Agreementapply to the oil trade. Since a large part of the United States companies&apos;imports of dollar oil are, for the convenience of suppliers, shipped from sourcesoutside the Continental United States, they may be held not to be subject tothese provisions, and certainly the Dominions are not bound by them. Nevertheless,any discrimination against oil anywhere in the Sterling Area would undoubtedly be held by the Americans to involve important questions of principle that couldnot be settled on technical grounds. The Argentine Agreement has alreadyprovoked unfavourable American comment even though we nave been able to pointout that it was Argentina and not the United Kingdom that chose to discriminate.Some of Commonwealth countries may, indeed, be already preparing to dis-criminate of their own accord, but it would be difficult to convince the americans that they were doing so without prompting from the United Kingdom, especiallyafer the publicity accorded to the meeting of Commonwealth Ministers last July.24. It has been suggested that British companies could drive United states companies out of their Sterling Area market by price-cutting. The suggestionassumes that British companies can produce oil at lower cost than United states companies. While there is no direct evidence available, there seems to be noreason for thinking that British companies have any advantage over United States* These figures differ from the Table II estimates because they exclude $20 million in 1949-50and $4 million in 1935 for purchases of dollar oil by Britmex referred to in paragraph 20. (e) 1.37457 c
companies since United States and British companies are both producing incontiguous areas in Venezuela and in the Middle East so that it may be assumed that local operating expenditure is at the same rate. The question thereforedepends largely on the relative efficiency of the British and American oil companies, and here, again, there is no reason to assume any great difference.Furthermore, in a price war selling prices are not related directly to costs and inthe. past the oil companies have been prepared to accept heavy marketing lossesfor short periods in order to retain the physical volume of their trade. The net result would probably be that each company would sell the same quantities of oil in the same markets but at lower prices. Since, as is pointed out in paragraph 14,lower prices do not substantially improve the dollar balance of payments and cause a large deterioration in our balance in other currencies, it appears that a policyof price cutting would be a dangerous expedient from the United Kingdom pointof view.25. Any decision to attack the level or growth of the American-controlledoil companies&apos; trade in the Sterling Area must therefore be regarded against thegeneral background of the issue of discrimination which is dealt with else wherein the brief. A further difficulty peculiar to oil is that the American oil companies, with the encouragement and often the active support of the state department, have built up a large investment in crude oil production and refiningin the Middle East, from which to a large extent they draw their supplies for their sterling Area markets.26. Clearly, the general questions of discrimination and of- Americanparticipation in the Middle East requires some estimate of the quantities andvalues of the oil involved. These are set out below on the assumption that onlythe quantities of oil described in paragraph 7 as British companies&apos; unallocatedsupplies are used for discriminatory purposes.27. Below are given the dollar savings that would arise from three methodspf replacing dollar oil with British-controlled companies&apos; unallocated supplies.These calculations must only be regarded as a rough estimate of possible savings in view of the lack of adequate data on the past trade of the American companies in the Sterling Area. Any scheme involving other Commonwealth countries will obviously have to be cleared with them after discussion with the United States.28.   The three methods are r (I) Limiting United States companies&apos; dollar imports into the Sterling-Area to the amount of their dollar imports in 1948-49.(II) Cutting their dollar imports to a given percentage of their 1948-49dollar imports.(Ill) Replacing United States companies&apos; dollar imports with the full amount of British companies&apos; unallocated supplies, as and when they arise.29. Only the replacement of the main petroleum products has been con-sidered. We shall not for some time produce enough of some grades of lubricantsand other special products even to meet British companies&apos; own trade, so that noquestion of replacement can arise.Method I. Limiting Dollar Imports by United States Companies to Present Level30. Table III sets out the future increment over the 1948-49 level of dollar imports by United States companies into the Sterling Area assuming pro rataincrease of business done by them and compares it with the British companies&apos;unallocated supplies in each year. In each year British companies&apos; unallocatedsupplies are, in the aggregate, sufficient to replace the net increment over 1948-49.This statement conceals differing positions with regard to individual products;for example, there is a slight deficit in kerosenes even at the present level oftrade, whilst in the long run there appears to be a deficit in fuel oil. But smallshortages in the immediate future can probably be met by drawing down stocks,whilst, in the long run, shortages of fuel oil can probably be made good at theexpense of other products. The last column therefore shows the full value ofthe increment as a potential saving under this method of discrimination.

The reason for the fall in the increment in dollar imports into the United Kingdom after1951 is the assumed completion of United States-owned refineries in United Kingdom in 1952. Thiswill not, however, eliminate imports of all dollar products by United States companies.3. Some United States companies already buy part of their supplies from British companies.These sterling supplies are excluded from the above calculations.Method II. Cutting Dollar Imports by United States Companies to 90 per cent.of 1948-49 Level31. To replace a cut of more than 10 per cent, in white products would beimpossible in 1949-50 as we have already assumed the maximum stock reductionthat would seem to be practicable; and, in fuel oil in the later years it may bedifficult to provide British oil to replace even as much as a 10 per cent. cut. on balance, however, it is felt justifiable to show the full value of the increment asthe potential saving under this method of discrimination.TABLE IV	000 Tons Net increments in dollar imports by U.S. companies over 90% of 1948-49 level			000 Tons British companies&apos; unallocated supplies* (iv)	$ Million Potential saving Method II Rvalue of (iii)) (v)	To U.K. (i)	To R.S.A.

The potential &quot; discriminatory &quot; outlet for fuel oil in the special case ofBritmex could be met out of these excluded quantities up to 1952, by which time Britmex is expecteddirectly or indirectly to draw its requirements from the Fawley refinery.Method III. Replacing Dollar Imports with the Full Amount of british companies&apos; Unallocated Supplies32. This method assumes the use of all British companies&apos; unallocatedsupplies as at present estimated to replace dollar oils, but the actual quantitiesavailable may in the event prove to be less or more.37457 c 2

The potential &quot; discriminatory &quot; outlet for fuel oil in the special case ofBritmex could be met out of these excluded quantities up to 1952, by which time Britmex is expecteddirectly or indirectly to draw its requirements from the Fawley refinery.33. The amount of British Companies&apos; unallocated supplies and, therefore,the scope for discrimination under Methods II and III would of course beincreased if consumption in the Sterling Area were reduced or if supplies toother areas could be cut. The practicability of making reductions in sterling area consumption is examined in Appendix VI and though there may be somesavings possible in consumption they are not likely to be large. The saving of250,000 tons a year in United Kingdom motor spirit consumption which has beenspecifically suggested as the possibility would increase the amount of the british companies&apos; unallocated supplies available to replace dollar oil. Under Method this would make it possible to peg imports at 85 per cent, instead of 90 per cent.It would make no difference under Method I, since the United States Companies&apos;dollar imports are based on the 1948-9 level. It would, of course, be possible,though obviously commercially distasteful, to restrict supplies to these countries to current levels or to check the rate of increase, but it must be remembered thatof the increase of over 10 million tons in sales of oil to other than dollar or hard currency countries shown in Table I as expected to occur between 1949-50 and1953, nearly 7 million tons is in respect of crude oil and would not thereforeincrease British companies&apos; supplies of refined products. Moreover any such restrictions would be liable to raise political issues which might result in thematter being raised at United Nations on the grounds that we were deprivingpeople of an essential raw material. On balance it was, therefore, felt wise to treat such possible additional available supplies as a margin of safety.34. Administratively Methods I, II and III would all throw up problems.These would be more troublesome under Method III owing to the inherent uncer-tainty that there will inevitably be about actual availabilities and demand (as opposed to forward estimates) which would make the planning of movements of oil in which both United States and British companies would be involved a difficult operation.35. Further, we shall have to ensure that other Commonwealth countries&apos;systems of control over dollar oil import is effective there has already been considerable confusion over imports from Bahrein, which is in the Sterling Areabut whose oil is in effect 90 per cent, dollar oil (see Appendix VII). Moreover,even if it may not prove necessary to have a Commonwealth allocation schemefor British companies&apos; oil under Method I or II, it would certainly be necessary under Method III.     &apos;36. The potential savings shown in Tables III-V are at an annual rate.In fact, the machinery for operating any of the methods of discrimination wouldtake time to set up and retrospective restriction on United States Companies&apos;imports would probably not be practicable, t   As a working hypothesis, it wouldt For this reason, the possibility of the Haifa refinery resuming operations before January 1950 which is the date assumed would be unlikely to enable any additional saving to be made.
probably be wise to assume a potential saving of only half the amounts shown for 1949-50 to be derivable from the three methods of discrimination examined.Probable American reactions37. While to date nothing has been said in America about discrimination in the Sterling Area there has, of course, been a great deal said about &quot; unfair competition &quot; in markets outside the Sterling Area since lack of dollars has alreadyencouraged some Governments to insist on oil companies importing sterling oilrather than dollar oil. The Anglo-Argentine Trade and Payments Agreementcaused a considerable stir. We must, therefore, expect adverse reaction to any suggestion of further &quot;discrimination &apos;&apos; though some people in the United StatesGovernment service if not United States oil companies have certainly envisaged the possibility of our being forced to do something to reduce our dollar outgoingson oil. It is because of this that there has been so much trouble regarding theUnited Kingdom&apos;s and European countries&apos; plans to build refineries. broadly speaking, the Americans feel that there is a serious risk of over-expansion ofrefinery capacity and crude production and that this constitutes a threat to american oil interests. What has happened on these two questions is set outin Appendix VIII. It is mentioned here since any emphasis on availability, of sterling oil to oust dollar oil will exacerbate the refinery trouble.38. Methods I and II would certainly be less objectionable to them thanMethod III, though it must be noted that there is a fundamental differencebetween pegging at current levels and pegging at something lower. In the formercase we are in effect telling the Americans that they must not expand any furtheruntil the world&apos;s currency position has been corrected; in the latter case, theymust actually cut back since there is little hope of the Americans being ableto find new outlets for any displaced oil. Method III would probably be particu-larly repugnant to them since the inroad on the American companies&apos; business would be progressive as British companies&apos; expansion proceeded. In point of fact, there would appear to be little point in broaching Method III at themoment. It would not produce in the first years a much bigger saving thanMethod II and it could always be introduced later if our position necessitated suchdrastic action.Section iii the Possibility of Saving Dollars by restricting  the British Companies&apos;Expansion Schemes39. The direct dollar cost of expanding the production and refining of oilconsists of payments for dollar equipment and designers&apos; fees. Where, however,the expansion is taking place, physically, within countries whose currencies arethe equivalent of dollars in addition to these items, account has to be taken of local expenditure on wages and materials.40. It is in any case difficult to distinguish between expenditure onexpansion and expenditure required to maintain production at the current leveleven as regards refineries. Where crude oil production is involved it is virtually impossible since new wells have to be drilled even to maintain production.41. Moreover, the expansion of refinery capacity achieved in any one year isthe result of expenditure over a number of years and work on a considerable partof the expansion programme has already been undertaken. In fact, out of a total estimated dollar expenditure on equipment and fees during the period 1949-1954of $116 million only $33 million is in respect of projects which have not yet been started. Any reduction above $33 million in current dollar expenditure must therefore involve delay in completing plans which have already been started.42. In these circumstances, it was felt that the only way of assessing theeffect of a cut in expenditure was to put direct questions to the oil companies.Accordingly, we have asked the major oil companies concerned what effect specifiedcuts in dollar expenditure would have on their future operations. They have notbeen able to give very specific answers at the moment, since, to do so, involvesre-working their whole plans. But, it seems that a reduction of about $50 million on the figure at present taken to cover dollar operating expenses and purchases of equipment may be achieved in 1949-50 largely due to Shell&apos;s hopes regarding
a revision of the basis of calculation of the value of royalty crude, to theirpresent expectation that outgoings for 1949-50 on royalties and for taxes willin any case be lower than was estimated last September, and to postponements ofcapital expenditure. A saving of more than $50 million could only beachieved by:- (a) Shell reducing current production, for example Shell have indicated thatto save an additional $40 million might involve a shutting back ofproduction in Venezuela by 6 million tons or nearly 30 per cent, oftheir current Venezuelan production. But as, broadly speaking, thevalue of oil produced is greater than the total costs of production, theloss in value of oil produced would be substantially more than the saving in dollar expenditure. Moreover, any suggestion of a largecut in production would be very badly received by the VenezuelanGovernment.(b) Slowing up the construction of refineries that have already been started.43. It would be theoretically possible to eliminate expenditure on explora-tion, but this would be deplored by Shell (which dollarwise, is the only companyinvolved) since the work will have to be done some time and, it must be remem-bered that exploration work has its disappointments as well as its successes andit is more satisfactory to operate a steady programme of exploration work than to find oneself one day in the position of having to do more exploration work than can conveniently be handled at one time. Shell &apos;s estimated expenditure onexploration work is $10 million in 1949-50.Section IYTanker Hire and Freights44.   The increase in the dollar expenditure on tanker hire and freightbetween 1949-50 and 1953 is largely on account of freight on United States Com-panies shipments of oil into the Sterling Area and reflects the increase in imports&quot;by them during this period.45. The dollar expenditure of the British-controlled oil companies on tankerhire is rigidly supervised, and is at present confined to period charters enteredinto in 1947-48, at a time of great tanker shortage. It is unlikely that they willrequire to charter additional tankers for dollars during the period under review.46. The main dollar expenditure on tanker hire so far as the UnitedKingdom is concerned is by the Anglo-American group and discussions are inprogress to see what reduction in dollar expenditure under this head is possible,e.g., by chartering soft-currency instead of dollar tankers.47. The freight on oil shipped by American companies into the rest of the sterling Area also costs us dollars. The methods of reducing their dollar importsof oil considered in Section II did not necessarily envisage a reduction in their total imports, since it may be agreed to allow them to import sterling oil in placeof dollar oil.48. A dollar saving would be achieved if this substituted sterling oil weresold c.i.f. to the United States distributing companies and carried in non-dollartankers. As regards dollar oil in the United States distributing subsidiaries inthe Sterling Area might be persuaded to change their existing practice and to buy f.o.b. from their parent companies and to transport their oil in non-dollartankers directly chartered by the subsidiaries themselves. It is not certain whether the nondollar tonnage available would be sufficient to displace all dollartankers now employed in the Sterling Area programme and the United states companies would doubtless offer considerable opposition to the suggestion thatthey should alter their trading practice on these lines.Summary49. Present estimates are that the Sterling Area dollar deficit on oil willbe $580 million in 1949-50 and that by 1953 it will still be $500 million in spiteof the oil companies&apos; very large expansion plans.
50. These estimates are based on normal expansion of consumption in therest of Sterling Area and the maintenance of restrictions on the consumption of petrol and fuel oil in the United Kingdom where, however, it has been assumed that the basic petrol ration will have been restored by 1953 to the 1947 level.51. The estimates also assume what are regarded as being maximum sales for dollars which can reasonably be expected in the light of current circumstances.These are put at $225 million in 1949-50 and $370 million in 1953.52. It would be possible to achieve a cut of $50 million in the dollar expenditure involved in the production of sterling oil in 1949-50 without serious effects on the current rate of output. Any further cuts would have an immediate effect on production.53. As regards dollar expenditure on freight some small savings, to theextent of a few million dollars at first but more in the long run, may be possible if United States companies can be persuaded to use non-dollar tankers to importoil into the Sterling Area.54. Purchases of dollar oil by British companies are already expected to fall from $56 million in 1949-50 to $16 million in 1953.55. Dollar expenditure on oil which United States companies import intothe Sterling Area can only be reduced by (a) reducing Sterling Area consumption and so long as the United states companies are allowed to meet their share of trade with dollar oil the reduction on consumption to achieve any given reduction in dollar imports will have to be 2^ and 3^ times as much in the rest of the sterling Area and the United Kingdom respectively;(b) using British companies&apos; supplies to replace United States companies&apos;imports of dollar oil.   Three methods have been examined : (I) Limiting American companies&apos; dollar imports into the Sterling-Area to the amount of their dollar imports in 1948-49.(II) Cutting their dollar imports to a given percentage of their1948-49 dollar imports. A cut to 90 per cent, could be putinto operation by using British companies&apos; supplies at presentunallocated and this is illustrated below; a cut to 85 per cent.Avould be possible if United Kingdom consumption of motor spirit can be reduced by the suggested 250,000 tons a year.(Ill) Replacing American companies&apos; dollar imports with the full amount of British companies&apos; unallocated supplies as andwhen they arise.56. Savings under these three methods are estimated as below. (In 1949-50the saving has been calculated on the basis of six months&apos; effective operation) : $ million1949-50       1951 1952 1953Method I     ......      11 46 41 55Method II   ......      21 68 56 68Method III......      25 95 134 11657. Any of the three methods would be distasteful to the Americans and method III particularly so since it would involve the prospect of progressivereplacement of dollar oil to an undefined extent; it would certainly accentuateour present difficulties with the Americans over the United Kingdom oil com-panies&apos; refinery expansion plans. The Americans regard these as excessive andtherefore likely to aggravate the difficulties of American companies selling oil ina world that is short of dollars.58. Apart from discrimination on United States oil imports into the sterling Area there is the special case of Britmex (an American-owned butBritish-registered bunkering company) on which an additional dollar saving mightbe achieved at the expense of arrangements that have been in force for 30 years.59. By adopting discrimination on the lines of Method II outlined in para-graph 56 assisted by the cuts in consumption referred to in paragraph 55 anda parallel reduction in the dollar cost of Britmex&apos;s operations a saving of
$ 80 million to $100 million would be achieved in 1953. To achieve a comparablesaving without discrimination would require a combination of drastic cuts in consumption (both of dollar and sterling oil) throughout the Sterling Area;a very severe shutting back of Shell &apos;s Venezuelan production, which would havepolitical repercussions in both Venezuela and Holland, and a curtailment ofBritish companies&apos; oil expansion programmes everywhere with consequentrestriction of foreign sales.

APPENDIX IIPurchases of Dollar Oil by British CompaniesBritish-controlled companies before the war regularly purchased oil fromother producers and refiners in order to fulfill their own marketing needs.Refinery operations were hot flexible enough to ensure that the product outturnof a particular company equalled its product demand and, in any event, there wasoften considerable profit in petroleum &quot; jobbing.&quot;2. Since the war the freedom of purchase has been restricted to sterling oilor to direct exchange of oil and, to a considerable extent, the deficit companiescan balance out their needs with the surplus companies. Nevertheless, permission to purchase oil for dollars has been given to meet short-term deficiences or long-term requirements. In addition certain purchases are made as part of reciprocal arrangements whereby other products are sold for dollars.Contracted Purchases3.   The contracted purchases are : (1) By A.I.O.C. from Socony Vacuum of motor spirit and gas and dieseloil. These contracts were made at a time of great shortage and werefacilitated by offering concurrently a contract for substantially larger quantities of products from Abadan. The contract to purchaseceases at the end of 1950, but the sales contract continues until end1952.(2) By Shell of Casinghead. Casinghead gasoline is liquefied from natural gas given off at wellhead. It is used for blending, with low gradenaphtha in the proportion of 1 in 3 to yield commercial grade motor spirit and in the production of aviation spirit. The present contractends in December, 1949, but Shell have intimated that they willprobably want to continue to make this purchase in 1950.(3) By Shell of gas oil and crude oil from Mexico. This purchase was made ata time of acute shortage and at an advantageous price. The contractends in December, 1950.(4) By Trinidad Leaseholds Ltd: (T.L.L.) of crude oil. In return productsare sold back for dollars at a profit. The contract is being renegotiatedbut covers a period of some years.(5) By Shell and A.I.O.C. of a proportion of that crude oil which Mr.Gulbenkian receives from his 5 per cent, interest in the Iraq petroleum company.(6) By Manchester Oil Refinery (M.O.R.) of crude oil of special specificationfor the manufacture of lubricating oils that would otherwise only beavailable for dollars.(7) By Berry Wiggins of special grade crude.The contracts for the last three are on an annual basis.Lubricants4. Certain basic grades of lubricants can only be bought in United Statesand British companies have not finalised plans for producing them.The bulk of the present sales to countries outside the sterling area are fordollars as part of F.E.24 trade and so are not a net dollar cost. No allowance is made for the. continuation of this trade in 1952 and 1953-Certain purchases are, however, to supply the sterling area and this deficitwill be wiped out by 1952.Other Products5. Petroleum coke of a suitable grade for electrodes is bought for dollars and minor quantities of special grade waxes and petroleum chemicals.

The 1953 dollar deficit on oil is, on latest estimates, expected to be $500million. A year ago it was calculated that with the oil companies&apos; plans as thenenvisaged our deficit with the Western Hemisphere on oil would be $220.At that time we looked at the Western Hemisphere as a whole and took credit for sales to South American countries. It is now felt desirable only to take credit for sales for actual dollars and to American account countries (Canada, Venezuela,Colombia, Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Panama, Philippines, Ecuador and central America. Expenses in any of these countries are taken into account as representing dollars. The E.P.C. (48) 72 figure for 1953 should, in fact, beincreased by $137 million to bring the two estimates into line. The reasons forthe changed position are as follows : Improvement in 1953 dollar position Reduced purchases of dollar oil by British companies  ... 4Reduced value of the United States share of trade in Sterling Area(due to price changes) ...     ...     ...     ...     ...        61Reduced net dollar expenditure on equipment ...     ...        56Deterioration in the 1953 dollar position Reduced value of sales (partly as the result of a reduction in quantity (3  million tons (mostly crude) value $65 million)partly as a result of lower prices)............       230Increased cost of tanker freight  ...     ...     ...     .....     ...        -20Increased operating expenses      ...............     ...        12Net Deterioration........................$ million121262141
Non-Dollar Balance of Payments Position2. There has been a similar change for the worse in our 1953 position.E.P.C. (48) 72 showed a credit balance of f1,028 million. Adjusted for south american sales this becomes $1,165 million. Current estimates show a credit of;&quot; million.  The change is due to the following causes -.r-*Improvement in 1953 non-dollar position  -$ nullibnReduced net expenditure on oil equipment     ...      ...      ...        28Miscellaneous receipts       ..................        28Deterioration in 1953 non-dollar position Reduced value-of oil sales (due largely to the fall in prices, butpartly to the fact that no receipts of foreign currency arenow claimed for British companies&apos; production at presentunallocated to any particular market. A year ago it was assumed that $150 million worth unallocated production would be sold in this way)  ......     .........       391Increased expenditure on tanker hire    ............        44Increased operating expenses (due largely to increased royaltypayments in the Middle East)       ......     ...     ...       13756572Net Deterioration.........      .........      ...      ... 5163. As regards expenditure on equipment, this is now estimated lower thanit was a year ago. In the estimates of expenditure on equipment made thenallowance was made for continued expansion at an increasing rate after thecompletion of the schemes then included in the programme. The change in theworld oil position and indications of reduced business activity have caused the oil companies to postpone some/plans which they had in mind. This does not imply that no further expansion is expected when present schemes are complete,but, oh present indications, the rate of new capital investment will slacken.It is now estimated that the peak of expenditure will occur in 1951 and it is alsoestimated that the bulk of the dollar expenditure on the Middle East pipelineschemes will be offset by contributions from the American shareholders. In thecase of non-dollar equipment the previous estimates are now thought to have been too high. A year ago Belgian currency was nothing like as hard as it is to-day and the purchase of considerable quantities of Belgian steel was allowed for.APPENDIX IVDollar Invoicing of British Oil Companies&apos; Customers in Non-Dollar,Non-Sterling AreasThis proposal&apos; has prima facie the attraction of being a means of recoveringfrom our customers some or all of the dollar costs which we incur for their benefit in obtaining the oil that we sell to them.Technically, we could invoice for dollars all oil supplied above a certain basicamount for each country, this would be difficult to justify convincingly now thatour oil-producing companies no longer make large marginal purchases of the major refined products from dollar sources. Alternatively, we could invoice in dollars all shipments not originating from Sterling Area sources, such as trinidad and Sarawak. The sterling element in the cost of our so-called &quot;sterling oil&quot;from, e.g., Curacao (N.W.I.) may be small, but in so far as we fail to give ourcustomers the benefit of it we should, to say the least, invite retaliation and give an impetus to dollar invoicing by any country which considers herself as animportant alternative source of supply to the United States of America. It may also lead to a demand for dollar royalties from Middle East countries, and it isnot possible at this stage to estimate what effect such a payment of royaltieswholly or, partly in dollars would have on the net amount of dollars which we are having to make, available to these countries. Lastly, we could adopt proportionatedollar invoicing for crude oil and products shipped from sources outside the sterling Area. The proportion chosen is to a certain extent arbitrary and so the less justifiable. That which could best be defended is that of the net dollarcost of oil to ourselves plus the payments of gold or dollars to Curacao and Iran(which are largely attributable to the operations of the oil industry) in relation37457 d 2
to the total value of British-controlled companies&apos; production. This gives a figureof 40 per cent, in 1949-50 and 20 per cent, in 1953. Although we might succeed in justifying such a policy as a mere modification of our existing &quot; dollar fordollar &quot; principle in the merchanting trade, even this method might lead to strongprotests from our customers if at the expiry of present agreements or even earlierthey were faced with a request for at least some dollars for oil which our companies had hitherto supplied for sterling. Theoretically, however, the amounts of dollarsinvolved, taking 1949-50 for purposes of illustration, are :-$ million from hard currency non-dollar countries     ...      ... 63From the countries where British oil companies ownconcessions or wayleaves or hire tankers 57From O.E.E.C. countries not included above ....... ...       104From others       .........      ...      ...      ...&quot;       42266In the case of hard currency countries such as Belgium and Switzerland,there would be no advantage in switching to dollar invoicing, since sterlinginvoicing equally reduces our balance of payments deficit, which is settled ingold. In the case of certain other countries which do not cost us gold, such as theArgentine, dollar invoicing would increase pressure for settlement in dollars orfor a dollar ration. If these countries are exempted from dollar invoicing, there might well be protests from others on grounds of discrimination. There is nodoubt that we would meet with the strongest opposition from E.C.A. if we adopteddollar invoicing for oil. They have recently been pressing for the elimination ofthe dollar sign from inter-European trade, and they have urged United Statesof America-owned companies in France and Italy to sell for local currency insteadof dollars. We on our side have been pressed to abandon dollar invoicing of sugar and nickel. - Moreover, if we included the dollar cost of refinery equipment in ourpercentage calculation (as is done above) we should reduce still further the alreadydoubtful possibility of obtaining E.R.P. financing for many of our purchases ofsuch equipment.The broad conclusion, therefore, remains, that quite apart from the obviousundesirability of extending the dollar sign further into the trade of the non-dollar world, while we still reserve the right to resort to dollar invoicing of oilif our dollar difficulties force that course upon us (in particular, if the Divisionof Aid is not settled to our reasonable satisfaction) we should only adopt that course as a last extremity as it would involve major political repercussions inour relations both with the United States of America and with the non-dollarworld, including particularly the other O.E.E.C. countries. It is for this reasonvery doubtful whether in the end an attempt to dollar invoice oil would resultin any net gain to the United Kingdom overall dollar balance of payments.APPENDIX VShell Caribbean Petroleum Company&apos;s Dollar LoanLast year, with the agreement of the Treasury, the above company, an american company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Shell-Royal DutchGroup of companies, borrowed $250 million in New York. Under the terms ofthe loan this money must be invested in capital projects in the western hemisphere. One way and another it was expected that these dollars would be expended over a three-.to four-year period, and they will relieve the UnitedKingdom Treasury of a considerable part of the dollar demands that Shell arelikely to put forward on capital account.It is currently estimated that Shell Caribbean will spend in new projectsa further $8 million during 1949-50 the big expenditure will not come until later. Credit has been taken for this in making out the Balance of Payments.Purchase of Western Hemisphere assets is allowed as well as investment in new projects, and one transaction of this kind has already been completed viz., thePurchase from another member of the Group of a 60 per cent, share in Shell ofanada for about $20 million.   A similar transaction is under consideration,

Total inland consumption of petroleum products in the United Kingdom-(excluding ships&apos; bunkers and petroleum industry&apos;s own use) in 1949-50 is now estimated at 13,915,000 tons; The main components of this figure are as follows^figures for 1948 and estimates for 1953 are included for purposes of comparison):- &apos;&apos;&quot;(Figures in 000 tons):&quot;;    &apos; &apos; . &quot; &apos; 1948&apos;Aviation spirit     ...      ...      ...Aviation turbine fuel     ..;      ...Burning oil ...Vaporising oil     ...      ...m / Gas/Diesel oil (exc. DERV)Fuel oil     ...      ...      ......Motor spirit        ...      ...      ...DERV fuel ...      ........2. The following remarks on the end uses of these &quot;products are confined tothe immediate 1949-50 position since the long-term trends are still under&quot;investigation.Aviation Spirit3. Out of the estimated consumption of 373,000 tons in 1949-50, over200,000 tons is attributable to the fighting services. The balance is accountedfor by the three air corporations, charter aircraft, foreign airlines flying to andfrom the United Kingdom and by engine manufacturers for bench and flighttesting of new machines or machines being overhauled. In addition there is asmall consumption by private fliers and flying clubs, which are strictly rationed.Any attempt to limit foreign airline services might well lead to retaliation against british airlines abroad, while economies by the British corporations could onlybe achieved by reducing services, thus weakening their competitive position vis-a-vis foreign operations. Enforcement of cuts on the engine manufacturers would interfere with development work or reduce standards of testing of enginesbefore they go into service. The private flier and flying-club use is already verysmall and strictly rationed, and the complete abolition of the ration would be a severe discouragement of an activity which is considered by the Ministry of CivilAviation to have considerable value.Burning Oil (including Air Turbine Fuel)4. All the consumption of air turbine fuel (estimated at 124,000 tons) is accounted for by&apos; the services and the engine manufacturers. Consumption of normal burning oil is estimated at 590,000 tons, of which approximately two-thirds is consumed for domestic heating, lighting or cooking. The balance isprincipally consumed in industry, agriculture and the railways (for signal lamps)!Deliveries to dealers and to industrial consumers are restricted to maxima laiddown on control cards, which each consumer must hold. How far cuts could beapplied to domestic consumers, without intolerable hardship, cannot be assessed,but it will be appreciated that for the most part those using burning oil for
lighting, heating or cooking do so because they either do not have other sources-,of fuel or are too poor to use them.Vaporising Oil       ** (5. Of the estimated consumption of vaporising oil (885,000 tons) over840,000 tons is accounted for by agricultural tractors and stationary engines.The small balance is used in fishing vessels and miscellaneous tractors. any immediate cut in consumption could only be achieved by limiting the use&apos; of machines in agriculture, which would afiect production proportionately. Thevaporising oil tractor is, by comparison with the diesel tractor, uneconomical in.fuel consumption. There is likely to be a long-term trend towards the use ofdiesel tractors, but at present the extra initial cost of these tractors makes themuneconomical for the average farmer. Even with the adoption of special financial measures to encourage a. turnover to diesel engines, it is not thought that anysubstantial result could be achieved on less than two or three years as extensiveretooling of factories (possibly involving dollar expenditure) would be necessary.Gas/Diesel Oil (excluding Road Transport)6. Inland consumption of gas/diesel oil is estimated at 1,591,000 tons. Thelargest single item is the gas oil used by gas works j where it is used in earburettedwater gas units mainly in order to cope with demand at peak periods. Suchplant could be replaced by coal-using plant, but this would be expensive and takea long time to carry out owing to the existing commitments of coke oven andfas works plant manufacturers. It would also involve a very large extra demandor gas coal. Industrial power units of various kinds are the other big item in consumption of this product, including auxiliary generating sets installed to helpovercome the present shortage of generating capacity : a prohibition of the useof these sets would save about 115,000 tons of gas oil, but would increase theestimated gap in winter electricity supplies by about 25 per cent. The balanceof consumption is accounted for by coastal and inland vessels, agriculture,bakeries, pottery and glass kilns, industrial furnaces and central heating, for themost part individually small.Fuel Oil &apos; / t   n    .7. Inland consumption of fuel oil is estimated at 2,920,000 tons (excludingoil used in refineries). The greater part of this consumption is for industrialfurnaces and steam raising (2,200,000 tons) and principally is used by firms who-converted from coal to oil burning as a result of the Government-sponsoredcampaign to save coal. The compulsory reconversion of these firms back to coal would clearly be open to very serious criticism and raise difficult issues Ofcompensation. Moreover, in certain processes, particularly in steel and othermetal industries, the use of fuel oil has considerable technical advantages over theuse of coal. Reconversion would, moreover, require the provision of coal-burningequipment which would take a considerable time to obtain. New applications toUse fuel oil are only permitted when there is exceptional economic advantage tothe country or where the use of an alternative fuel is impracticable. One Otheritem in fuel oil consumption is central heating, which accounts for 200,000 tonsa year, nearly half of which is consumed in schools, hospitals, factories and green-houses and only a small proportion in private houses. The supply of oil;to new plant is only allowed now in most exceptional cases, but existing users are onlylimited by an arrangement of some years&apos; standing made with the oil companies,to restrict supplies to the minimum required for efficient operation. more stringent restrictions could only be enforced by the; institution of an elaboratesystem of rationing by the Ministry, involving increased use of man-power and government expenditure. How far it would be possible to restrict consumption&apos;without excessive hardship is impossible to estimate without a detailed assessment of individual cases.8. The above analysis indicates the fields of consumption which would beaffected by cuts in oil supplies. The effect on industrial and agricultural activitywould depend upon the extent of the cuts and also where they fell. At present,apart from burning oil, there is no rationing system controlling the allocation ofthese oils to various users, and it would therefore be difficult to apply selectivecuts intended to hit hardest the least essential undertakings or to ensure that,available supplies Were evenly distributed.
9. In the, view q  the Mi^st^y of Fuel and Bower, significant cuts in the(estimated consumption by these users would be undesirable and impractical.Motor Spirit and Diesel Oil for Road Vehicles ,10. In the case of private, commercial and passenger vehicles, a strictrationing system is enforced- Arrangements for colouring commercial petrol havebeen introduced which have virtually eliminated, the black market. The privatemotorist receives only a small ration sufficient for 90 miles motoring a month(doubled for three months in summer). Supplementary allowances are onlygranted for essential use. .Private Motoring11. The Minister of Fuel and Power has suggested that the most that can reasonably be achieved in the field of private motoring would be a saving of100,000 tons. It would be difficult to obtain the whole of, this saying in 1949-50.12, If it were nevertheless decided to abolish the standard petrol ration andsummer bonus, this would give a saving of about 350,000 tons m a full year, or.200,000 tons in 1949-50 To achieve a comparable saving by cutting supple-mentary petrol allowances, would require an effective cut of 30 per cent, (and amuch bigger initial cut to allow for appeals).13. Past experience in the abolition of the basic ration and also in theapplication of percentage cuts to, supplementary allowances suggests that any action to obtain savings on a large scale would lead to a flood of appeals fromthe public and thus to ^erjous administratiye difficulties, necessitating increaseduse of man-power in the Civil Service, and that the saving would not be&apos;permaherit.There would also be a serious danger of the re-establishment of the black market.&apos;ComrtiereialTmw&amp;sport.14. The Ministry of Transport consider that a saving at the rate of150,00Q tons per annum on the current rate of consumption could be achieved inthe ease of commercial goods and passenger vehicles by (a) a general icut of 15 percent, in the issues to goods vehicles, with restoration in part or in whole (whereneed is ,shown giving a net saving of approximately 7^ per cent, in cpnsumption,and (6) reimpqgition qf the 12i per cent, cut (at present per cent.) in allowances for excursions and tours and private parties, with a distance limit for privateparties of 70 smiles (rpund trip), except with special permission qf  he RegionalTransport Commissioners.   The full rate pf saving would not be realised until-&apos;3 months after the date of announcement pf the cuts.15. Further saving could be made by a return to austerity in the use of fuel. It wpuid create material hardship, involve considerable changes in presentmethods of transportation and distribution, and could not be justified for cpmmer-cial vehicles unless tlie standard ration for private cars were abolished witjh &amp;drastic pruning pf supplementary issues. Fpr goods vehicles, there would be-a net put of IP per cent- This would involve a consideration of individual traffjpsand facilities as well as a general cut- It would mean considerable reorganisation of wholesale distribution and some reduptipn in retail deliveries which wpvildhit the still harrassed housewife. For passenger service vehicles there would haveto be a pruning of ordinary bus and short-distance coach services, as well as a cut in long-distance express services. The cut on excursions and tours and privateparties would be increased to 20 per cent. The further saving so realised might amount to some 70,000 tons a year.16. Further cuts could be imposed, but these would mean virtually a returnto war-time conditions in the use of oil fuel and, as then, could only be achievedwith the co-operation of industry and the public, who would have to be convincedthat the hardships involved were necessary and were being shared equitably byall users. The net cut on goods vehicles would be increased to 15 per cent. Thiswould necessitate the reintroduction (under the aegis of the Departments con-cerned) of war-time schemes for the zoning and rationalisation of wholesaledistribution and a heavy reduction in retail deliveries. For road passengervehicles, there would have to be a material pruning at off-peak hours of ordinarybus and short-distance coach services, without disturbing essential, e.g., workers&apos;services. ^ Long-distance express services would be eliminated except where noother facilities exist. The cut on excursions and tours would be increased to&apos;25 per cent.  These cuts could be expected to yield a further saving of 120,000 tons,
making a total saving under all the cuts referred to above of about 340,000 tons,in a full year.17. The Ministry of Transport considered that action on the lines set out above can only be undertaken successfully if (i) the public are convinced that the savings are necessary, that road transport is not being singled out, and that comparable cuts are beingmade in other dollar purchases (e.g., other consumption of oil fuel,films, tobacco, &amp;c.);(ii) the necessary staff both in numbers and in quality can be made availableto enable the cuts to be adjusted so as to avoid a hold-up of traffic;(iii) additional coal including a proper proportion of large coal is madeavailable to the railways to enable them to carry the additional traffic,including additional passenger excursions to replace tours and excur-sions and private parties by road; and(iv) the standard ration for private cars is abolished with a further pruningof supplementary allowances should a cut on commercial transport inexcess of 150,000 tons per annum be imposed.18. The Ministry of Fuel and Power do not accept that conditions (iii)and (iv) are a necessary prerequisite of reductions in commercial consumption.APPENDIX VI(6)Possibility of Savings in Oil Consumption by the Rest of the Sterling Area1. At the conclusion of the Conference of Commonwealth Finance ministers the other Ministers went away with an undertaking to seek to limit their totaldollar expenditure on imports to 75 per cent, of the expenditure during the calendar year 1948. In addition the Commonwealth Finance Ministers wereaddressed by the Minister of Fuel and Power on the need to save dollar oil, but were told at that time that our policy regarding possible discrimination againstoil imports from dollar sources had not yet been settled.2. The United Kingdom has had no detailed information yet from theCommonwealth about the cuts and indeed the other members of the Common-wealth are not bound to tell us in detail how they propose to achieve the cut.As regards oil we have had a communication only from the Government ofAustralia who say that their consumption programme for 1949-50 is below thatfor which the oil companies programmed. This almost certainly is not due todeliberate post-conference cuts.3. The self-governing territories of the Commonwealth, not being bound by the Anglo-American Financial Agreement of 1945, might find it easier thanthe United Kingdom to discriminate against dollar oil, but if they all sought tomake a 25 per cent, cut in imports British oil companies could not in total replacemore than about a 10 per cent, reduction in dollar imports. Further replacement of dollar imports could therefore only be made in conjunction with cuts in con-sumption in the Commonwealth countries; it would be unrealistic to count at thisstage on obtaining any very substantial saving by this means.APPENDIX vii the Dollar Drain Arising from Certain Activities of United states companies in the Sterling Area   .Apart from the dollar liability arising on imports from dollar sources somedollar liability arises from United States oil companies&apos; own activities in the sterling Area or from their subsidiaries&apos; activities in the United Kingdom. two cases that call for comment are : 1.   American-owned Bunkering CompaniesAmerican-owned bunkering companies registered in the United Kingdomconduct a soft currency trade which, to a considerable extent, they have taken overbecause their customers abroad could no longer provide dollars for dealing direct with the American parent companies, as used to be the case.
i It is for consideration whether these companies should be limited not to a figure of dollar oil purchases based on past performance as has /been the case in1.948 and 1949, but rather to a figure equal to. their sales of oil to dollar shipping.In as far: as this-policy relates to bunkering stations owned by those companies in the * United Kingdom itself, it is merely a part of the general discriminationissue. ,-r:As - iegards xthe; companies&apos;; bunkering stations outside the UnitedKingdom, such restrictions might, even be imposed without the possibility of beingeffectivelycchallenged,under.Article 9 of the Anglor American Agreement of 1945,since this-Article relates only to Sports into,the United, Kingdom. The possiblesaving could he of the, order of $13 million a year, but the American, companies&apos;reaction is likely t,o be unfavourable particularly as the principal company con-cerned-Tf-British Mexican Petroleum (Britmex) has been in business for 30 years.2.   Bahrein Petroleum company the position of the wholly American-owned Bahrein Petroleum Company isspecial. This&apos;company produces some oil at Bahrein but in addition purchasescrude oil for dollars in order to keep fully occupied the Bahrein refinery, whosecapacity is about three times the crude oil production in that Sheikdom. Atpresent we find dollars ($44 million net ihT948 against which the sterling areagot oil worth $60 million c.i.f.) for the company&apos;s crude oil purchases, expenses and profits on the understanding that they do not invoice oil to non-sterlingterritories in sterling. ! To treat this company wholly as a sterling company would immediately involve a request from these American interests to sell their oiloutside thei sterling area for sterling and to convert the profits from such thirdcountry sales into dollars at our expense. The alternative would be to treat thecompany as a United States company and this is how it has been dealt with inSection III.Representatives of the California Texas Group, to which the BahreinPetroleum Company belongs, are about to have discussions with United Kingdom-officials.   Until these are completed no action is necessary.:   . APPENDIX VIIIUnited States Present Attitude Towards Dollar/Sterling ProblemThere are, at the moment, two interrelated oil questions which have been receiving much American attention recently and which are closely bound up with the question of discrimination. These are (i) European and United Kingdomoverseas refinery expansion plans, and (ii) the displacement of dollar oil by sterlingoil which is already taking place in non-sterling area countries, e.g., Argentinaand Egypt. . 1&quot; Overeapansion &quot;2. The Americans feel that the refinery plans may aggravate the positionof the American oil companies and E.C.A. has, for the moment, refused to finance European countries&apos; refinery expansion plans-beyond an arbitrarilyselected amount-on the grounds that anything in excess of this would represent an overexpansion of world refinery capacity. The oil people in E.C.A. had evenhinted that they would like to stop the use of free dollars for &quot;unagreed&quot;refinery projects, though this would raise a point of general policy which E.C.A-might not wish to advocate. In any case, as the result of difficulties in ParisO.E.E.C. asked the British, Dutch and American Governments to make a reviewof their overall refinery position. The Americans were asked to join in sinceAmerican companies are not only concerned in the building of refineries inEurope but also have plans for non-European areas as have the British companies.3. The review has just been completed and though no report has yet beenissued it is likely to show that in 1953 the plans for erecting refineries would show a theoretical surplus of 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, over what is likely tobe the demand for oil on the basis of normal expansion. To decide where theoverexpansion is taking place is, however, a different matter owing to the conflict of different interests. The European countries assert that as it is cheaper in37457 v
foreign currency to import crude oil than refined products expansion of theirOwn refinery capacity up to their total consumption requirements is not onlyjustified but necessary to achieve viability. In view of this both the UnitedStates and United Kingdom oil interests plan to build refineries in Europe inorder to protect their market positions. On the other hand, the big oil interests have certain concessional obligations to erect refineries in the countries where the oil is actually produced. The position is also complicated by the fact that some european countries favour the establishment of locally-owned refineries arid as these are likely to want to operate on sterling crude-which is likely to be avail-able this is again a matter of concern to the Americans and is leading them to blame us not only in connection with our refinery plans but also with our plans for the expansion of the production of crude oil. Any suggestion that this&quot; over-expansion&quot; should be directly or indirectly financed by the United states is naturally somewat galling to them.,4. The position is also confused by the fact that, while we have as yet no precise figures, it is clear that some companies are pruning their plans in thelight of the present outlook for oil demand. A year, ago, when most of the refinery projects were drawn up, the world envisaged a shortage of oil that might go on tor years and would certainly be very acute in the winter of 1948-49. The1948-49 winter shortage never occurred, largely owing to an exceptionally mildwinter in the United States, and since the spring, given the currency to pay for it, there has been no difficulty in buying oil. It is quite possible, therefore, thatthe figures of availability on which the view that overexpansion is likely is basedmay prove to be excessive. It is also very difficult to assess world demand three or four years ahead.Displacement of Dollar Oil5.   The possible effect of the world shortage of dollars on their overseassales has been on the American oil companies&apos; minds for some time.  It was not,however, until the Anglo-Egyptian Financial Agreement and the Anglo-Argentine Trade and Finance Agreement that the issue came to a head.   The* former, which was an exceptional case, has been settled more or less to american companies&apos; satisfaction in that the United Kingdom subsidiaries of american companies are being allowed to put in oil to meet their Egyptian associates&apos;requirements.   Since, at the moment, we allow United Kingdom subsidiaries of American companies to buy oil from their parents for dollars, this arrangementnot only protects the American companies&apos; distributive position in Egypt, butalso the outlet for the oil which they produce.  This arrangement was only madebecause at the time of the agreement additional sterling oil products of the kindrequired by Egypt did not appear to be available to supplement what british companies will in any case be putting into Egypt to meet their own commercialdemand. With the expansion of British companies&apos; production which has already taken place, this situation will not continue.  British companies are likely to have,even in 1949-50, &apos;&apos; unallocated supplies &apos;&apos; of oil see paragraph 7 of text.   TheAnglo-Egyptian arrangement, in fact, represented a concealed way of providingEgypt with more dollars.   The Anglo-Argentine Trade and Finance Agree-ment was different.  We undertook to make available-at any rate for 1949-50 against sterling payment quantities of fuel oil and crude oil which would coverArgentina&apos;s entire import requirements.  And, as British companies are likelyto have the additional quantities of fuel oil and crude oil needed, there wouldbe no point in our making an arrangement such as was made in the case of Egypt.The American companies therefore lose the outlet for the oil that they could produce and would in ordinary circumstances sell to Argentina.    We have,however, endeavoured to make arrangements whereby the American companies&apos;Argentine subsidiaries would themselves buy the additional British companies&apos;oil and therefore retain their position as importers, partly because we do not wish to create unnecessary difficulties for the American oil companies, and partly because we feel that if Y.P.F., the Argentine Government-controlled oil company,were to take over the importation of oil for the American distributors in argentina they might then be inspired to try to do the same with Shell.6. Somewhat curiously, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, which isthe principal American company involved in Argentina, has decided againstavailing themselves of the opportunity that we fiave offered them-and have
APPENDIX IXUnited States Oil Interests in the Middle east the major United States oil companies with interests in the Middle Eastarea are the Standard Oil Company (S.O.C.) of California and the Texas Cor-poration, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, Socony-Vacuum and theGulf Oil Corporation. Certain of the smaller United States oil companies arealso directly concerned.2. The United States Government own no part of the capital of these companies, and indeed in 1944 decided that it was contrary to national policy for a pipeline from Arabia to the Mediterranean to be built and operated by theGovernment Petroleum Reserve Corporation. But, although not directly financiallyinvolved, the United States Government consult closely with these American oil37457 vdisclosed to the Argentine Government--of defending at least their position asimporters. This is probably due to fears about their situation elsewhere. while no one has yet openly talked about the possibility of M discrimination &quot; in the sterling area, Standard have, no doubt, said to tnemselves that if they agree to buy sterling oil for their Argentine market, what is to stop them from being forced to buy sterling oil for their sterling area markets.American Companies and the Dollar element in Sterling Oil7, The American oil companies now charge us with behaving in adiscriminatory manner in not allowing them to sell for sterling outside the sterling area while we allow British companies to do so in spite of the fact that there is,by our own admission, a considerable dollar element in sterling oil. They cite,of course, Shell&apos;s production in Venezuela where there is, obviously, a veryconsiderable dollar element, and suggest that they would be prepared to ask usto convert into dollars the sterling they would receive from the non-sterling areabuying countries only to the extent that we should have had to provide Shellwith dollars if they had supplied the oil. Standard Oil of New Jersey hasspecifically approached the Treasury on this, point and a memorandum detailingtheir suggestions is expected shortly. Pending its receipt, all that can be saidis that their suggestion is most unlikely to prove acceptable or even workable.What the American companies overlook, is j[i) that the Anglo-Iranian is also a potential supplier with a much lower dollar element in its oil and though this company&apos;s potential outlet in the Western Hemisphere must to some extent belimited by geographical i.e., freight-considerations, in so far as crude oil isconcerned they may well be prepared to accept a low price for marginal quantities,and, the dollar element in A.I.O.C&apos;s production of crude oil is very much lower than Shell &apos;s Venezuelan production, (ii) Shell sell considerable and increasingquantities of oil for dollars so that the net cost to us in dollars of Shell&apos;sVenezuelan operations is only about 45 per cent, of the gross cost, whereas the americans obviously have in mind a gross percentage of 60 per cent, to 70 per cent.Any arrangement with American companies on the lines of the american companies&apos; ideas would, therefore, have to be on a &quot;horse trading&quot; basis.With the intercompany relationship of A.I.O.C. and Shell joint marketing inmany areas, and very large purchases of Shell from A.I.O.C. no one can stateprecisely what is the real dollar content of sterling oil.8. Caltex, too, are thinking on somewhat similar lines and are talking oflargely increasing their expenditure in the sterling area and in Europe, when itsuits them to talk O.E.E.C. rather than &quot; our &quot; close relationship to help our dollar position, as they put it. This is a development which merits serious con-sideration since any new outlet for United Kingdom produced oil equipment andother goods is presumably to our advantage. The other side of the picture must,however, be closely examined since American oil companies will not buy over herewhat they can buy more conveniently and often more cheaply, in America without some kind of a guarantee that they will be allowed to accept sterling (even if only partially convertible) for sales tp countries in the sterling area.
companies and have done much to promote their interests; thus, it was due toState Department pressure that the Iraq Petroleum Company in 1927 agreedto allow an American group to participate in its eapital.3. The chief Middle East countries in which American oil interests areconcerned are :- (a) Saudi Arabia, where an exclusive concession is jointly held by S.O.C.of California, S.O.C. of New Jersey, the Texas Oil Company andSocony-Vacuum.(b) Bahrein, where the S.O.C. of California and the Texas Oil Company holdexclusive concessions.(c) The^Saudi Arabian-Kuwait &quot; Neutral Zone,&quot; where the American Inde-pendent Oil Company and the Pacific Western Oil Company holdexclusive concessions.(d) Kuwait, where the Gulf Oil Company hold a 50 per cent, interest.(e) Egypt, where Socony-Vacuum is an equal partner with Anglo-EgyptianOil Fields in the Western Sinai venture.(/) Iraq, Syria, Israel and Jordan, by reason of a 23f per cent, share of thecapital of the Iraq Petroleum Company held by ah American group,chiefly S.O.C. of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum.(g) Persia, where S.O.C. of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum have an indirectinterest by reason of an agreement with Anglo-Iranian to supply them with crude oil on a long-term basis.4. The extent of these United States holdings can be judged by the -iactthat the American share in Middle East proved oil reserves in 1948 was 41 percent., and the estimated American share in Middle East oil output by 1956 is43 per cent. The Middle Easfs proved reserves now greatly exceed those ofthe United States (which were 3,600 million tons in January 1949), and itsunproved reserves are estimated at still higher figures (20,000 million tons forthe Persian Gulf area alone, according to a Texas Oil Corporation estimate).5. For an analysis by countries of the American share in Middle Eastoutput and proved reserves see the Table as the end of this Appendix.6. Whatever may have been the case in the past, there can now be no doubtthat from a political and strategic point of yiew it is in the interests of HisMajesty&apos;s Government that the United States should have a large financial interest in the safety and prosperity of the Middle East. At present, this interest is almost wholly derived from the commitments of the American oil companies(though, e.g., the United States airways companies also have Middle Eastinterests and there is one American representative on the Board of the suez canal Company).7. It is therefore a matter of concern- to His Majesty&apos;s Government that measures designed to reduce the dollar drain of the Sterling Area&apos;s oil supplies should not be such as to cause any major reduction in United States oil investment in the Middle East. The danger of such &quot;a reduction is the greater since, ifcommercial factors alone were to operate, any marginal decrease in the UnitedStates companies&apos; total oil output would, for geographical reasons, probably allfall on their activities in the Middle East. (It is just possible that the UnitedStates Government might bring pressure on the companies to maintain middle east production at a higher level than commercial policy would dictate, so asto husband oil reserves of the American continent, but this line of reasoning seemsto have lost some of its potency in recent years and may be utterly invalidatedif Canadian oil reserves prove to be of anything like the size at which they arenow tentatively estimated.)8. Discrimination on the scale, assumed in method (iii) of Section II might lead the United States companies to close down their operations in a particular area of the Middle East or to reduce their production evenly throughout the whole area. But in view of the likelihood of a constantly rising world oil demand inthe foreseeable future it is, in fact, much more likely that the United states companies would react to a reduction in demand as a result of discriminationby suspending their present expansion programmes than by actually withdrawinginvestments already made.
9.   The conclusions to which these considerations lead would thus seemto be (a) that any reduction in demand incurred by the United States oil companiesas a result of discrimination against them by the Sterling Area wouldprobably lead them tb revise their programmes in the Middle East;(b) that such a revision would be more likely to result in the suspension of expansion programmes and some shutting back of production over their Middle East ventures as a whole than in the complete abandon-ment of any one of them.10. It might therefore appear that there is no reason to avoid a policy of discrimination on the ground that it might lead to such a reduction in UnitedStates investment in the Middle East as would be politically and strategicallydangerous to British interests should that policy of discrimination be on balancedesirable from all other points of view. These preliminary conclusions are,however, derived only from study of the problem from the technical angle ofUnited States oil investment commitments, and they require to be re-examined in the light of future Anglo-United States relations as a whole.11.   A discriminatory policy would presumably be adopted by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment either (a) as part of an agreement with the United States Government; or(b) as part of the measures of a more desperate nature taken independently,if no satisfactory conclusion emerges from the Washington discussions.12. In the first case the policy of Anglo-United States co-operation in theMiddle East would presumably be covered by the agreement, and would not beaffected by some contraction of activity by the American oil companies. In thesecond case, discrimination would be only one of many steps we should haveto take which would prejudice Anglo-United States relations, so that a generaldeterioration in those relations would in any event threaten Anglo-United Statesco-operation in the Middle East.13. There is, however, one final consideration which must weigh in the scales. So long as United States exports exceed United States imports, the onlylong-term solution to the problem of balancing trade may be the encouragement of United States investment overseas of both Government funds and private capital. Such investment could hardly fail to be discouraged by a policy of discrimination on oil that results in a considerable decline in the profits derivedfrom the largest of all existing United States overseas investments, the interestsin the Middle East of the American oil companies.14. On balance, however, provided the general question of United Statesoverseas investment is borne in mind, a policy of discrimination, if acceptableon other grounds, need not be rejected because of possible repercussions on united States policy in the Middle East.
