THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OP  HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  September 1949SECRET Copy No.3 1CP. (49) 19629th Septemberi 1949CABINETSOCIAL AND MEDICAL ASSISTANCE : reciprocal arrangements WITH OTHER countries memorandum by the Minister of National Insurance1. In CP. (49) 190 the Minister of Health refers to a Convention on thissubject (reproduced at Annex) which has just been drawn up by a technical sub-committee of the Brussels Treaty Permanent Commission. He points out thatthis Convention only covers indigent nationals of any of the contracting countries who are normally resident in one of them, and leaves untouched the wider problemof medical treatment for resident aliens who are not without resources, andforeign visitors. He proposes that we should try to widen the present negotiationsso as to cover both these classes, or at least visitors, on better terms.2. I agree with this proposal on the assumption that it is not intended tohold up the signing of the Convention whilst these new negotiations are being pursued. Apart from its medical aspect the new draft Convention containslimited but valuable provisions for reciprocity in the matter of financial assistance.In this country such assistance is available to anyone in need, irrespective of hisnationality. Unfortunately the other countries are not so broad minded, with theresult that the position of our nationals becoming destitute in, say, France, is often very bad indeed. They may be refused assistance on nationality grounds and left to private charity or referred to our Consuls. The latter may have toarrange for their repatriation at public expense, and when they reach thiscountry they have to be cared for by the National Assistance Board. Particularlyhard cases occur where the person, though technically of British nationality, has lost alJ his connections with this country and may even be unable to speak English.Nor is the present situation in any way fair to the British taxpayer. The draftConvention dbes hot impose on the other countries obligations quite as wide asthose which we have already voluntarily assumed, but it is a start, and I am anxious to get it adopted whilst the going is good. For the first time it opens theway to the payment of public assistance to persons of British nationality who maybe in need in any of the contracting countries.3. No doubt a good of redrafting will be Wanted to put the Sub-Committee^ wording into proper diplomatic form and I understand that it isnow being examined from that point of view by the Foreign Office experts. I hopethat it may be possible to get a suitable revised version agreed by the Othercountries in time for signature at the next meeting of the Consultative Councilin November.J.
