J..     53HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)S E C R_E T .;kNO.  3 /0. P. (49) -151 COPY15TH JULY, 1949CABINETTHE DOCK LABOUR INDUSTRY AND-   THE NATIONAL DOCK LABOUR board memorandum by the Minister of Labourand National service think it advisable that when considering the mernorandum by the Minister of Transport (CP. (4?) 145) the cabinet should have before them my views on the issues raised in that paper,2. I am in general agreement with the description of thepresent situation in the industry given in paragraphs 1 - 8 ofthe Minister of Transport&apos;s paper.      I am, however, in disagree-ment with the implication in the remainder that the disrupting-condition of unrest in the industry can in any way be related to the organisation of the National Dock Labour Board.      one has only to look at Annex &apos;B&apos; of the Minister of Transportspaper to see that of all the many irritating disputes whichhave arisen, only a very few have anything whatever to do withthe Dock Labour Scheme.     Nearly all the disputes are on questions of rates of pay and similar matters which are nothing to do with the National Dock Labour Board but are entirely amatter of normal industrial negotiations under the aegis of theNational Joint Council for the Port Transport Industry.      Itis true that there are a few disputes which have arisen out of disciplinary action taken under the Dock Labour Scheme and someon questions of allocation of work and on the reduction of the registers.     To suppose that if all the suggestions made by theMinister of Transport about the organisation of the Decasualisa-tion Scheme had been in operation any one of these disputeswould have been avoided, .1s really making an assumption forwhich there is no evidence.-3. In paragraph 9 the Minister of Transport appears tosuggest that the industry would have worked more smoothly ifthe trade unions had been kept entirely out of the administra-tion of the Scheme and if its administration had been entrustedsolely to the Port Authorities.      I am quite certain that ifthe Government had attempted any such arrangements we shouldhave found the organised workers solidly against us and if wehad enforced it by Government action, the friction and disputeswould have been multiplied.4* In paragraph 11 the Minister of Transport says that a modification of the present arrangements of the Dock labour scheme is urgently needed if we are to avoid a succession of unofficial strikes.      In my view it is entirely wrong to suppose that some modifications of the Dock Labour Scheme can possiblyremove the underlying causes&apos; of this recurring unrest in theindustry.      It is true that the Dock Labour Scheme as at presentorganised has not succeeded in inculcating the proper spiritof co-operation and loyalty amongst the dock workers in general.It is equally true in my view that without this Scheme the unrest would have been far worse than it has proved to be.

5. With regard to the specific proposals made in para-graph 12 of the Minister of Transport1s paper, I have noobjection to. these being examined, although I ought to say atonce that I strongly dissent from proposal (i),     I should,of course, be glad if out of these proposals- some improvementin the administration of the Scheme could be achieved, but Iam quite sure that these minor improvements in the administra-tion of the Scheme would have no substantial effect on the underlying causes of unrest.      I should expect the examinationto show that after two years&apos; experience some small improve-ments in such matters as the relationship between the national board and the Local Boards and in the disciplinary arrangements might be suggested.     On the question of independent representa-tion on the National and Local Boards, I should not expect tofind that friction in the industry could be cured by, ineffect, taking the administration:of the Scheme out of thehands of the industry itself and handing it over to independentrepresentatives.       The Scheme, if it is to succeed, mustsurely be run in a way acceptable to both sides of the industryand from experience I know well that neither side of theindustry would accept the idea that they should be placedvirtually in the hands of independent management.6* If these matters are examined I would suggest thatthey should be considered in the first place by officials ofthe Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Transport in consul-tation with officials of the National Dock Labour Board.     I donot agree that at this stage the employers and the trade unions,the British Transport Commission and the Port Authorities shouldbe, brought in.     Before that is done, it seems to me essentialthat the Minister of Transport and myself should reach agree-ment as to the lines on which we think some improvements mightbe pursued.      In suggesting this I have in mind the PrimeMinisters Directive, C P. (M-9) 95 of 29th April, 1949, underwhich we are enjoined to ensure that matters of this kind should first be thoroughly examined at the official level before they are referred to Ministers and that before such matters are referred to the Cabinet, if there is disagreement, there shouldbe personal discussion between the Ministers concerned.      ishould much have preferred that the Minister of Transport&apos;sproposals had been examined interdepartmentally on the official level before specific proposals were submitted to the Cabinet.7, In short, therefore, I would suggest that the workingof the National Dock Labour Scheme be remitted for officialexamination by the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry ofTransport who may, as necessary, bring into consultationofficials of the National Dock Labour Board.      Thereafter Ishould hope that the Minister of Transport and myself would boable to agree on the next step to be taken.8. Any improvements effected in the National Dock labour scheme in this way will, in my judgment, be comparatively minorones and, as I have said, will have little effect on the under-lying causes of unrest in the docks.      What is wanted is some method of ascertaining what these underlying causes are.     Thisis something that cannot be done in the course of a week or two.It means a close and detailed study of the conditions in the docks and of the feelings and reactions of the dockers.     this can only be done by a group of people with social welfareexperience making a thorough investigation.      I accordingly

suggest that, in addition to the official examination of theworking&apos;of the National Dock Labour Scheme, the Governmentshould, as soon as the present strike is over, appoint a body, consisting of employers, trade union officers and1social welfare workers, to make a thorough investigation into the causes of unrest in the docks.     I have not con-sidered the names of the possible members of this body, butI think a person like Sir Frederick Leggett would be theright kind of Chairman.G. A.
