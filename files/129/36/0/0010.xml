(k10) 160 COPY NO. ^/21 ST JULY.  19U9CABINETMEETING OF COMMONWEALTH FINANCE minister&apos;s memorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Commonwealth Finance Ministers met in london from Wednesday, 13th July to Monday, 18th July, and officialsare continuing to meet during this week to discuss a number of detailed points.     The conclusions of the Meeting took the formof recommendations by the Ministers, which are subject to approval by their Governments,      A copy of the recommendationsis annexed. ,f2. The Meeting was notable for the identity of views which was eventually reached, even on such a controversialmatter as the necessity for immediate action in the for n of,or equivalent to, cuts in dollar imports.to the extent pf 25per cent.     The Canadians naturally dissociated themse&quot;&quot;resfrom the recommendations about&apos; cuts in dollar imports,   aid theSouth Africans, too, not being members of the sterling;!%re,a^dollar pool, were in a different position from the rest.   - &quot;but all appreciated the necessity for drastic action immediately,and for a constructive approach to the long-term problemj   andthere Was a unanimous determination to do whatever was possibleto maintain the&apos; strength of the sterling area.3. Section I of the recommendations (paragraphs 1-9)deals with the long-term objectives of economic policy.     TheMeeting agreed that the aim must be the achievement of a pattern of world trade in which the dollar and non-dollar countries could operate together within one single multilateral system.In general, Ministers welcomed the talks with Mr. Snyder andMr. Abbott, though the Australian Government felt some mis-givings, possibly because they had not been consulted about them beforehand.     This part of the recommendations will form part of the general brief for the talks that will take place in washington in September, and it did not give rise to any sub-stantial division of opinion.      Special emphasis was placedduring the discussions on the obligations of the dollar area tomake a multilateral system work, particularly by means of investment in under-developed and other territories.k* Section II of the recommendations (paragraphs- 10 and11) deals with the positive steps that should be put in handimmediately for the purpose of increasing the dollar earnings of the sterling area and reducing its dollar expenditure bydiversions.      The degree to which this can be done will depend to a considerable extent on what resources, particularly steel,can be made available to the Commonwealth by the United Kingdom,and it is clear that, unless there is a substantial increase inour exports of steel and some selective increase in our exportsof steel capital equipment to the Commonwealth, we shall runinto difficulties both on this part of the programme and on theemergency measures to cut sterling area imports.     We shall haveto balance very carefully the advantages and&apos; disadvantages ofsuch action.     The Economic Policy Committee decided on 12thJuly (E. P. 0.(1+9) 28th Meeting, Minute 3) that we should not

take the initiative in trying to persuade Australia and NewZealand to divert butter and meat from the United kingdom market. .   This possibility was, however, raised by the NewZealand and Australian Ministers themselves, and officialswill discuss what action can be taken.5. Section III of the recommendations (paragraphs12 - 1k) deal with the emergency action which must be takento reduce the:drain on the reserves in the immediate future.It was natural that this section should give rise to thegreatest difficulties.     At the beginning of the Meeting, inspite of the lead given by the United Kingdom and the Colonies,every delegation was inclined to say that,  either because ofits essential needs, its low standard of living, or its out-standing commitments, no substantial reduction in dollar importscould be made in 19k9/50.      As the meeting proceeded, Ministersbecame increasingly av/are of the seriousness of the situationand of the necessity to make substantial reductions immediatelyif the sterling area was to continue to exist.      They finally agreed, unanimously (with the exception, of course, of canada and South Africa) to the recommendations contained in thissection, and we can regard them as being satisfactory.      Itwill be seen from paragraph 1k that &quot;Ministers agreed to informeach other within one month of the measures which their Govern- .ments have resolved to take in the light of these recommenda-tions&quot;.6. The last section of the recommendations (paragraph15) deals with machinery for continuing consultation between governments on these matters.      The creation of new machinery would have given rise to serious difficulties, and it wastherefore agreed that the existing Commonwealth liason committee, which was set up primarily to keep the commonwealth governments,informed on European Recovery Programme matters,should be adapted for the purpose of those consultations.This means that the Canadian Government will participate fully as a member of the Committee and will not be represented merely by an observer, which was the suggestion they made at one stage.7. Ministers agreed to consult their Governments on thequestion of showing the recommendations confidentially to membersof the United States Administration, and undertook to notify us of the decision on this point by 30th July.      My own view, whichis shared by the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer, is that we should so inform the Americans of therecommendations, though the document itself would, of course,not be published.8. I therefore recommend:-(i)   that my colleagues should approve the recommenda-tions contained in the Annex to this memorandum;(ii)   that, subject to the approval of the other Common-wealth Governments, the recommendations should be shown confidentially to members of the ;UnitedStates Administration. ,.H.

ANNEX95Meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers, July 1949Te-oot of Agreed Recommendations to GovernmentsIThe Meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers welcomes the discussions which have taken place between United Kingdom, Canadian and United StatesMinisters and agrees that the aim must be the achievement of a pattern of world trade in which the dollar and non-dollar countries can operate togetherwithin one single multilateral system. The Meeting notes with satisfaction that further discussions are being arranged to take place in Washington early inSeptember to consider the action required to carry out this aim for the mutualbenefit of the dollar and sterling countries.2. The Meeting considers that the achievement of this aim will requireaction by all countries concerned, which may involve important modifications in policy. The objective conditions in which a single multilateral system of world trade and payments is practicable do not at present exist. To establish them will require action by all countries both in concert and individually. Theresponsibility falls both on surplus and on deficit countries.3.   Accordingly the policy of all countries should be directed&apos; towards (a) implementing their obligations under international agreements to take steps to promote full and productive employment, without which ahigh level of international trade cannot be sustained;(&amp;) facilitating the establishment of a world-wide pattern of production and international trade such as to make possible a system of internationalpayments which is self-balancing;(c) developing the agricultural and industrial resources of under-developed countries in order to increase their levels of production and consump-tion and to enable them to play their full part in the system ofmultilateral trade, and so contribute to full employment;(d) exploring further the conditions, and the machinery, for the organisationof an adequate flow of international investment for all forms of productive development;(e) &quot;restoring international monetary reserves generally to levels which canaccommodate reasonable fluctuations in international balances ofpayments;(/) collaborating in arrangements designed to ensure reasonable and stableprices for primary products.4. A major aspect of the present disequilibrium in world trade is the lackof balance between the dollar countries and the countries of the sterling area.In the past few years substantial financial aid from the United States and Canadahas been necessary in order to balance the sterling area&apos;s dollar accounts. Theobject of policy is to achieve balance, without this extraordinary aid, on the basisof a high level of transactions and the normal working of the multilateral pattern of trade. 05. The achievement of a more reasonable balance between the dollar and sterling area countries can be facilitated by the development of trade between these two areas and other countries. Nevertheless, any such development willnot of itself relieve the sterling area countries of the necessity to take directmeasures to secure such a balance.6. This balance in the sterling area&apos;s dollar account at a high level of tradetherefore requires a large expansion in the dollar earnings of the sterling area countries, and the development in the sterling area of production at competitiveprices which will reduce the need for abnormally large imports from the dollar countries.37292
7. This suggests the following course of action by the sterling area countries :  -(a) To increase the supply of manufactured goods and primary products,competitive in price and quality, (i) to dollar markets, (ii) to appropriate sterling area and other markets at present abnormally-dependent upon supplies from the dollar, countries;(6) to increase the supply of dollar earning services, including touristservices;(c) to promote such adjustments in the pattern of production as are necessaryto achieve (a) and (b);(d) to promote reasonable conditions designed to facilitate investment bythe surplus countries.8. In order to sell at competitive prices sterling area countries should, where necessary, take measures to reduce their costs of production and should (a) bring any remaining inflationary elements in their countries under control;(b) bring the claims upon their productive resources both for investment and for consumption into line with the resources currently availableto them, including external borrowing;(c) encourage action designed to increase efficiency in production.9. Action by the sterling area countries alone cannot create the conditionsnecessary to establish a multilateral trading system. This requires that allcountries should carry out the policies in paragraph 3 above and all deficitcountries should carry out the policies on the lines indicated in paragraphs 7 and above. Moreover, the surplus countries should make their full contribution tothe building of a multilateral system by (a) maintaining a high level of employment, income and demand;(&amp;) assisting and encouraging the purchase of goods and services from othercountries;(c) encouraging international investment by their nationals and throughnational and international institutions, particularly under conditionswhich do not impose limitations on the area within which the fundscan be spent;(d) promoting the gradual transfer of resources within their territories fromforms of production in which their costs are relatively high comparedwith those of other countries.II10. Emergency measures to stem the current drain on the sterling area&apos;reserves are perforce negative and unconstructive. It is, therefore, all the more necessary to take, in the immediate future, any positive and practical steps thatwill lead towards the agreed long-term objectives. In this connection care shouldbe taken to concentrate upon measures which would fit into the permanent pattern of world trade.11.   The Meeting considered that these steps should include (i) the speediest possible increase in the efficient and economic productionwithin the sterling area of those commodities which can earn dollarsor which the sterling area would otherwise have to purchase fordollars;- (ii) co-operation to secure the most effective use of the resources availableto the sterling area in the interests of the area as a whole, even where this involves some measure of sacrifice on the part of individual countries such as doing without sterling area goods that, in the common interest, should be-sold for dollars;(iii) the expansion of sales of sterling area goods in dollar markets, withspecial attention to prices, selling methods, and market requirements;(iv) an intensive effort to increase the sterling area&apos;s dollar earnings fromthe provision of services of all kinds, including tourism.The Meeting decided to set on foot immediately a detailed examination ofthe application of the policy outlined above.
Ill12. There was a full discussion of the developments which had led to therecent serious drain on the central reserves of the sterling area, and the gravity of the position was recognised by all the representatives present. With the reserves standing at 30th June, 1949, at a figure of approximately  400 million,it is clear that if they continue to fall at the present rate they wouid be completelyexhausted within about a year. This would mean the collapse of the sterling area with incalculable consequences to all countries concerned. The sterling areamembers of the Commonwealth agreed that, in the first instance, they must checkthis decline in the reserves by every practicable means and that immediate actionto this end was vital to the very existence of the sterling area. With the foregoingconsiderations in front of them they examined the immediate prospects of the sterling area in full detail.13. The sterling area representatives present reached agreement on theprobable level of dollar earnings of the sterling area (excluding South Africa) in1949-50, and examined the additional gold and dollar resources likely to beavailable from grants and loans to the United Kingdom and from receipts by theUnited Kingdom of newly-mined gold. They agreed that the amount whichcould be made available from all these resources for their aggregate expenditureon dollar imports in 1949-50 could not exceed $2,000 million.14. In the light of these circumstances they agreed to recommend to their governments that each should reduce their demands in respect of dollar importson the above-mentioned resources in 1949-50 by a proportion equal to that already announced by the United Kingdom. To the extent that it has not already beendone the representatives present agreed to recommend that their governments should achieve this objective by immediate action comparable with that already taken by the United Kingdom, by way of stand-still measures, by reprogrammingof imports, and, where appropriate, by other means. Ministers agreed to informeach other within one month of the measures which their Governments had resolved to take in the light of these recommendations. They also agreed that the situation should be kept under constant review so that further consultations could takeplace immediately developments appeared to make necessary any adjustment inthe measures contemplated above. They further agreed that the rebuilding ofthe sterling area reserves as quickly as possible was of paramount importance,and that they should all make the maximum practicable contribution to this end.IV15. It is important that there should be arrangements for continuing cqn-sultation between the Governments concerned to ensure that the most effective measures are taken at each stage to secure the objective in view. It is suggestedthat existing machinery.should be used to study the problems which arise fromthe recommendations of this meeting and that officials at present in London should-continue discussions during this week [i.e., the week beginning 18th July, 1949].
