JTHIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1949.-276CONFIDENTIALCP. (49) 18914th September, 1949CABINETNINTH SESSION OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCILOF THE UNITED NATIONSNote by the Prime minister circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a report on the Ninth Sessionof the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. The United kingdom delegation was led by the Minister of State (Mr. McNeil) for the first seven days and thereafter officers of the Ministries concerned conducted the business.Report on the Ninth Session of the Economic and Social Council,Geneva, 5th July to 15th August, 1949The Ninth Session of the Council dealt with an Agenda of 49 items,of which 3 were deferred until the next session. A good rate of progress was maintained, but owing to the amount of time necessarily spent on the two dominantitems, namely, the Technical Assistance Programme and Forced Labour, theCouncil was obliged to sit for two days beyond the scheduled closing date.2. This Session was in fact more satisfactory than previous Sessions of theCouncil. It gave detailed conideration to a number of questions and in generalreached decisions satisfactory to the United Kingdom. This success was largely due to an unusual restraint shown by the Soviet Delegation during the openingweeks. Unfortunately, this restraint later deserted them in the discussions onforced labour, slavery and unemployment.3. Mr. Thorn (New Zealand)- successfully concluded his term of office as president, and sincere appreciation of his services was widely expressed at theconclusion of the Session. The first vice-Chairman was M. Skorobogaty(Byelorussia) who took over the Chairmanship of the Social Committee, whileDr. Santa Cruz (Chile) was elected to take the place of Dr. Stolk (Venezuela) assecond vice-Chiairman. Dr. Santa Cruz proved to be an able Chairman of theEconomic Committee and enhanced his claims to be the next President of theCouncil.4.   The following are some of the more important features of the Session : Technical Assistance for Economic Development of Under-Developed Countries5. Consideration of the Secretary-General&apos;s plan for a programme of technical assistance for under-developed countries was recognised as the most&apos; C. R.

important task yet undertaken by the Council. The following is a summary ofthe results of three weeks of intensive Committee work : (a) A Technical Assistance Conference will be held during or immediately following the Fourth Session of the General Assembly with repre-sentatives from each of the members of the United Nations and from each Government with members of the Specialised Agencies partici-pating in the programme. This Conference will ascertain the, total amount of contributions available from participating &quot;governments for the first year&apos;s operation of the programme. It will also reachfinal agreement on the proportions of the total available funds to be allotted to the United Nations, the Specialised Agencies and theReserve Fund.(b) Meanwhile, the Council has recommended the following ratio for distri-bution in the first fiscal year of the first $10 million made available : Per cent.United Nations   ...      .........      ...... 23United Nations Educational, Scientific and cultural organisation         ...      .... 14Food and Agricultural Organisation ...      ...      ... 29^        The World Health Organisation       ...      ...      ... 22LeNtox-   International&quot; J&amp;Eftde&apos; Organisation    ...      ...... 11International Civil Aviation Organisation   ... 1(?) The Council agreed that this programme, should be administered through a Technical Assistance Bpar$, consisting of &quot; he repr^sent;atiYies o! the participating Specialised Agencies Meeting under tlpe&apos; C^aj^a^aftipof the Secretary-General. The Council will be kept informed of theactivities of the Board through the Technical Assistance Committeeof the Council. This Committee will be authorised to sit while theCouncil is not in session and will be required to npake an annual report to the Council.6. It is worthy of note that the Soviet bloc, although abstaining on thefinal resolution adopted by the Council, made no appreciable attempt to exploit the possibilities of obstruction latent in these discussions, and, in general, the degree of agreement reached has given the Council confidence in the possibilityof achieving concrete results in the near future. Indeed, in private conversationwith the Minister of State M. Arutiunian, head of the Soviet Delegation,displayed such an interest in the project that the Minister of State thought it possible that the Soviet were anxious not to cut out the satellite countries fromthe operation of the scheme. This, of course, has not been confirmed by any public declaration by the Soviet.Regional Economic Commissions7. The debate on the Annual Report of the Economic Commission for europe gave the United Kingdom Delegation an opportunity to point to someof the more objectionable extravagances of the Commission and to stress the heedfor&apos; economy and a sense of proportion. This, for the first time, was well receivedby most delegations.Forced Labour. Replies made  by  Governments to the Secretary-General&apos;senquiries as to the extent to which they would be prepared to co-operate in an impartial enquiry into the conditions of forced labour.8.   There was special interest in the debate on this item since the UnitedKingdom Delegation had focussed public attention on the text of the SovietCorrective Labour Codex.   The debate developed along lines similar to the eighth Session debate on Forced Labour.   The Soviets reintroduced a resolutionrejected at the Eighth Session, proposing the establishment of an international trade union commission to investigate working conditions throughout the world.The Slav bloc, did not attempt to deny the existence of. the corrective labour system,but pointed out the educationalaspects of their system in comparison with thepunitive prison systems of capitalist countries.   There is no doubt, however, thatthe publicity received by this debate seriously worried the Soviet Delegation.An attempt by the United States Delegation to establish a Commission ofEnquiry into&apos;the existence of forced labour, irrespective of whether&apos; or not the
Slavs co-operated, was defeated on the grounds that the replies received to theSecretary-General^ enquiries did not provide sufficient information for theestablishment of a Commission of Enquiry.Unemployment and Full Employment9. The debate on these items provided a suitable opportunity for the soviet bloc to put forward their usual thesis of decadent capitalist economies anddeclining workers&apos; standards throughout the Western World, in contrast to theever-increasing prosperity of the new democracies and the Soviet Union. the debate was most acrimonious. The Secretary-General was eventually instructedto appoint an ad hoc group of experts to prepare a study for the next session ofthe Council on methods of maintaining full employment.Study of Statelessness10. The impending dissolution of the International Refugee Organisation(I.R.0-) gave the problem of statelessness a new urgency, and the Council requestedGovernments to provide the necessary legal protection for refugees after the dissolution of the I.R.O. It also requested the Secretary-General to submit a plan for the international protection of refugees to the Fourth Session of theGeneral Assembly. In addition, an ad hoc Committee of representatives ofthirteen Governments is to consider the advisability of preparing a revised andconsolidated Convention on the international status or refugees and statelesspersons and, if considered necessary, to draft a Convention for the elimination of statelessness.
