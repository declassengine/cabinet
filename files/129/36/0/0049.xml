(*9) 1998th October, 1949CABINETGOLD COAST, constitution memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the Committee which has been considering constitutional reform in the gold coast has now reported and decisions are required on its recommendations. TheCommittee was appointed in the following circumstances.2. Under the present constitution of the Gold Coast there is a LegislativeCouncil with an unofficial majority and an Executive Council, which is advisoryto the Governor, with an official majority. There are three unofficial african members of the Executive Council, but these have no executive responsibility fordepartments of Government. The Watson Commission of Enquiry into the disturbances of February and March 1948 was impressed by the need to giveAfricans a greater share in the forming and execution of policy and made recommendations with this object in view. His Majesty&apos;s Government in August1948 welcomed these recommendations in broad outline arid suggested that a fullyrepresentative local committee should be set up in the Gold Coast to examine them.We stated that, if the recommendations were acceptable to local opinion, wewould regard them as broadly acceptable, subject to certain reservations, andwould be prepared to make arrangements for their early implementation.3. The local Committee, which started work in January, consisted entirely of Africans under the chairmanship of an African judge, Mr. Coussey, and wasrepresentative of all parts of the Gold Coast and of all sections of opinion,including the nationalists, although not the extreme nationalists. Their report is unanimous except on three points, two of which are mentioned below. It is a balanced and reasonable document and the somewhat bold experiment of appoint-ing an all-African committee has proved successful.Local government. The Report makes comprehensive recommendations for the reform of&quot;indirect rule,&quot; the development of local government on modern lines, and thebuilding up of regional administrations in the Colony, Ashanti and the northern territories. These are broadly in accordance with our general policy and can beaccepted, although the details will need further working out locally. It is highlysatisfactory that the Committee has devoted so much attention to local governmentand has recognised its importance to sound political development.The Legislature5. The Committee propose a bicameral system, with a Senate consistingof Chiefs and &quot; elder statesmen &quot; and a House of Assembly consisting almostentirely of members elected directly or indirectly by popular vote. The Committeeonly decided in favour of a bicameral system by one vote and therefore submittedalternative proposals for a single chamber. It would be difficult to make abicameral system work in the Gold Coast at this stage of political development.I propose, therefore, to reject the idea of a bicameral Legislature and to acceptthe Committee&apos;s alternative proposals for a single chamber, in which, however,a third of the seats would be reserved for Chiefs and &quot; elder statesmen.&quot;37681
The Executive;6... &apos;The main questions for decision arise with regard to the Executive. Onthis subject the most important recommendations of the Watson commission were : (1) that there should be a majority of African members drawn from theLegislature on the Executive Council;(2) that African members of the Executive Council should have responsibilityfor the administration of departments;(3) that the Governor should retain his reserve powers;(4) that the Executive Council should cease to be advisory tb the governor and should become a board of Ministers with collective responsibility to the Legislature and should initiate policy.7. In the Statement published with the Watson Commission^ report we accepted the first three of these recommendations. With regard to the fourth,we stated that, while agreeing that the Executive Council should be the body whereall major questions of policy should be discussed, at this stage it would be prefer-able to retain ^the formal arrangement in the constitution under which the councils advisory to the Governor.8. The Coussey Committee have recommended that the Executive council should consist of the Governor as Chairman; three ex-officio members (the chief secretary, the Legal Secretary and the Financial Secretary); a Leader of theHouse of Assembly elected by that House; and seven Ministers drawn from theLegislature (five with portfolio and two without portfolio). A minority reportopposes the inclusion of ,ex-officio. members. , Under, the .,Cpmm\ttee&apos;.s recommenda-tions the Ministers would beappointed by the !Go&apos;vernor.;ihcoi)islultation with the leader of the House and wpuhi.be required to resign collectively on a vote of hoconfidence in the Leader by twoTthircjs of all the members of the House of assembly. The Executive Council would be the chief instrument of policy andwould be collectively responsible &quot;to the House of Assembly and hot responsible to the Governor. The Committee, has recommended that the , Governor shouldhave the usual reserve powers, although a minority report has opposed theretention of the Governor^ power of veto.9.   There are two points in these proposals which I feel are unacceptable.In the first place, I do not think that we can accept the proposition that theExecutive Council should not be responsible to the Governor.   By proposing thatthe Governor should have reserve powers, the Committee-have themselves in effectaccepted the yiew that    must retain ..ultimate, responsibility, and they have there-fore been inconsistent in recommending that the: Executive Council should not beresponsible to,him.   The, Governor&apos;s ultimate responsibility for the administra-tion of the Territory must be. retained until the stage of internal self-governmentis reached.   We can, however,, safely concede that, -provided the ,Governor&apos;sultimate responsibility is secured, the Executive Council sbjould hp longer be a purely advisory body.   I propose that it should, be &quot;described in the constitution as the main instrument of policy (as it is in Jamaica and will be in Trinidad) andthat decisions should be taken by a majority vote, subject to the,safeguard that-the Governor would be empowered to act, against the. majority, decision, with theSecrqtary of State&apos;s prior&apos;ap.prov^ is one falling,withip the scope of his. reserve powers. Equally,. (pf - course, the Governor wouldhave the usual reserve powers in relation to the Legislature.10. Secondly, there are &quot;difficulties about the Committee&apos;s proposal that aLeader of the House of Assembly should be elected by that House. In the absenceof any group or party system in the Gold Coast such an elected Leader could notbe sure of retaining the support of a majority of the House of Assembly and,without it, continuity in the conduct of public business could not be maintained.In practice, however, it will be necessary to have a Leader of the Government side in the House of Assembly, and I propose that the members of the ExecutiveCouncil, ex officio and African, should select one of their number to perform thisfunction.11. As regardsthe composition of the Executive Council, I propose, in agree-ment with the spirit of the Watson and Coussey Cpinniitltee&apos;&apos;s reports, that itshould have an unofficial majority. A Ministerial system would be introduced,and at this stage the Ministers would be selected by the Governpr and appointedby him subject to a favourable resolution by the House of Assembly.
Colonial Office,8th October, 1949.12. The proposed arrangements are similar, in their main essentials, to those already in force in the Sudan and to those shortly to be brought into force inTrinidad, which were approved by the Commonwealth Affairs Committee on29th October, 1948 (OA. (48) 8th Meeting, Minute 1). Thev are also in accord-ance with the views of the Governor and his official advisers, three of whom flew toLondon to discuss the report in detail. The Governor is satisfied that the pro-posed scheme is workable and best calculated to provide political experience forAfricans by pinning responsibility on to- them and to promote the orderly progressof political development in the Gold Coast.13. During the past eighteen months there has been considerable politicalagitation in the Gold Coast and the extremists have been conducting a campaign for immediate responsible government, which has attracted support among the lessresponsible elements. There is, however, a large body of moderate opinion which,while recognising that the country is not yet ready for full responsible government,is convinced, as the Governor and I myself are, that immediate constitutional advance is necessary. I think that it is important that the Governor should beplaced in a position to rally behind him this moderate opinion. The CousseyCommittee is recognised by the public in the Gold Coast as having been a widely representative body and its report is undoubtedly a victory for moderate opinion,If we accept the report broadly, subject to the reservations set out in paragraphs and 10 above, as I feel sure we should, the Governor hopes to have moderate opinion behind him, although the extremists will not of course be satisfied. Ifwe are not prepared to accept it broadly, moderate opinion will be alienated andthe extremists given an opportunity of gaining further and weightier support andof making serious trouble. I am satisfied that at the present stage of political development in the Gold Coast no system would be workable which did not provide,as my proposals do, for a very considerable degree of African participation in thecontrol of policy, while preserving the Governor&apos;s ultimate responsibility.14. The Committee&apos;s report is known to have been submitted to the Governoron 29th August. We have handled it since its receipt with great expedition, as indeed was publicly promised by the Governor, with my authority. The public in the Gold Coast is anxiously awaiting its publication and, in the view of theGovernor, which I share, it is important that it should be published without delay.It is important also that His Majesty&apos;s Governments views on the report shouldbe published simultaneously with it, since otherwise there would be a period of uncertainty and speculation on the intentions of Government, of which the extremists would undoubtedly take advantage for their own ends.15. Subject to the concurrence of my colleagues, I therefore propose to publish the report on 26th October, and at the same time to issue a statement of theviews of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the form of a despatch to the Governor.I also propose to make an announcement in the House of Commons on that day inreply to an arranged question.A.
