3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y * S&apos; GOVERNMENTSJ C R E T,P. (49) 165   .?TH JULY. 1949CABINETTHE DOLLAR CRISISInterim Measures which might be taken either by the United States or Canada &apos;Memorandum by the President of the Board of trade .    UNITED STATESWe have already raised the following points with theUnited States- (a)   More flexible administration of E.R.P.     This was raised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer with Mr, Snyder, whosuggested that it should be discussed&apos; with Mr. Hoffman on his forthcoming visit to Europe.     The points which we wish to raisehave already been studied by United Kingdom Departments here and preliminary representations on them have been made both tothe E, C. A.  Mission in London and to certain of Mr. Hoffman&apos;ssenior officials who have recently been visiting Paris.      much the most important question is that relating to E. R. P.financing of Canadian wheat, on which representatives of E. C.A.continue to see serious difficulties.     Their general attitude is that wheat, though not formally declared surplus by theUnited States Department ot; Agriculture, is in fact a surpluscommodity and must be treated by E. C. A.  as such.     arrangements are being made to press our representations on Mr. Hoffman whenhe comes to London for conversations at the beginning ofAugust.(b) Stockpiling.     This, too, was raised by the Chancellorof the Exchequer with Mr.  Snyder, who said that in princ., )le hewas in favour of the resumption and, indeed, intensification ofstockpiling purchases, but that action over a large part/ . f thefield was dependent upon the voting of the necessary appropriate :pria-tions by Congress.     The necessary Appropriation Bill is-, sti&apos;11before Congress and it is suggested that the Chancellor^representations should be followed up by our Embassy in washington as soon as the Bill has been passed.(c) Drawings from the International Monetary Fund. (I. M. P. )In recent months the United States have made a determined stand against the grant of drawings to countries (such as India)which they consider to be in a state of fundamental dis-equilibrium.     We have contested the basis of the United states attitude, and in addition it was suggested to Mr. Snyder that,without prejudice to this underlying difference of view, theUnited States ought to be prepared to reconsider their policyin the light of the special and additional disequilibrium whichhas now arisen.      Mr. Snyder promised to instruct the UnitedStates Executive Director on the Fund to re-examine thisquestion (which, incidentally, becomes of greater importance tothe sterling area as a result of the possibility that Australiaas well as India may wish to submit an application to drawdollars from the Fund).      It is doubtful if the United StatesCOPY NO.

will change their attitude before the September conversations,,but it is suggested that we should now enquire whether theUnited States are prepared to take a more sympathetic andco-operative line.(&amp;)     International Bank.     Mr.  Snyder indicated that theUnited States were prepared to support a liberal use of theresources of the.International Bank, e.g* as regards the grantof *loans to India for the purposes of capital development.Our latest informatipn is that the Bank are likely to grantsubstantial loans of between $100 and  150 millions to Indianbut there is one special point in connection with the Indianapplication which it might be worth while for India and ourselves to press at this stage.      Certain expenditure on capital develop-rnent projects was incurred in I9I+8/u10 and was one of the reasonsfor India&apos;s heavy drawings on the central reserves in thatperiod.      India endeavoured to persuade the International Bankto grant loans with retrospective effect;    in that event, india would have been able to repay to the central reserves a propor-tion of the amounts drawn from those reserves in 1948/49.     TheInternational Bank, after careful consideration of this sugges-tion, has indicated that it does not feel able to grant loans to cover expenditure already incurred.     This decision may well have to stand, but if it could be amended there would be adirect benefit to the central reserves.      It is suggested,therefore, that one further attempt should be made to persuade the International Bank to change its present decision, t(e)     Administration of United States tariff.,    I madestrong representations to Mr, Snyder regarding certain features of United States tariff administration which were hampering our export drive.      I am supplying detailed information which hepromised to have considered.     This is a long-standing contro-versy and it would probably be as well to defer any furtherformal representations on it until the September discussions,.2, There are a number of other interim measures whichmight be examined here with a view to their being raised inSeptember.      None of them would appear to involve Congress.They are:-(a) Synthetic Rubber.     The present use of syntheticrubber as against natural rubber is, I understand, substantially in excess of the statutory minimum laid down by Congress.      Itwould clearly be helpful if in September it were possible,without provoking reactions in Congress, to persuade the UnitedStates Administration to use their administrative powers to lower the&apos;&apos; quajfit^ of synthetic rubber required to be used by industry 4^3--ihe--United States to the minimum provided for bythe Act,      In this way we should avoid raising the major issueof the current United States domestic legislation, which deesnot expire until the summer of 1950, and with which it would be unwise for us to appear to be interfering.(b) Export-Import Bank.      It would be useful to explore inSeptember the possibility of loans from this Institution to sterling area countries like New Zealand which are now membersof the International Monetary Fund or the International Bank,but which may wish to ease the strain on the central reservesby some form of borrowing from the United States.(c) The International Monetary Fund and E.R. P. countries,including the United ii in-dom.      Under a decision of the I. M, F.Board, based &quot;on recommendations made by the United States,countries in receipt of E. R. P.  assistance were debarred fromdrawing from the Fund in 1948/49, save in exceptional circum-stances.     Consideration ought to be given between now and september to the question whether we should seek either to have this ruling abrogated or to apply for drawings founded uponexceptional circumstances.

B.     CANADA   &apos;3. We have already raised the following points:-(a) Active encouragement by^Canada of United Kingdom and sterling area imports,, -particularly as regards United Kingdomcapital goods.     These are somewhat general issues on which itis difficult to visualise further specific progress before september, when we expect to be talking to Canadian representa-tives not only in the tripartite conversations but subsequentlyat a meeting of the Anglo-Canadian Continuing Committee in ottawa.(b) Freer use of the Canadian Credit.     The presentassumption is that we shall draw  12.0 millions in 1949/50.That would leave a balance of $55 millions.     The Canadianattitude is that, given their own general balance of payments position and the likely effect on them of our contemplated importcuts, they are unlikely to be able at the most to do more thanconfirm a willingness to allow us to draw  120 millions in1949/50.      It is doubtful if it would be wise to press thispoint any further before. September.(c) Canadian stockpiling of certain strategic raw materials.Mr. Abbott promised to have this examined on his return toOttawa, but he made it clear that available Canadian funds were extremely limited (about $8 millions in total) and that theprospects of the Canadian Government being able to ask for anincreased vote were very slender.     This, too, can best be pursued in September.(d) Co-operation in avoiding any liability on the UnitedKingdom to repay Newfoundlands interest-free loan.     As aresult of the financial arrangements made between Canada and newfoundland, there is a real danger that Newfoundland may askfor repayment of the interest-free loan of approximately 8 millions.     Ways and means of avoiding this unwelcomeadditional liability were discussed with Canadian officials,who promised to send us a considered reply after discussionwith Ministers in Ottawa.      They were not very hopeful and wemay have to deal with the matter by accepting the liability topay interest against an undertaking by Newfoundland not to call the loan for a given period of time.(e) Easement of the arrangements, for repayment of the1942 interest-free loan.      This loan is being repaid by thesale of United Kingdom/Canadian securities.      The original suraof  700 millions has been reduced to.about $300 millions.Current repayments have,however, been reduced to a negligible   -level Toy arrangements to offset against the sale of securitiesrequirements for United Kingdom investment in Canada and for thepurchase price of Canadair aircraft. For the moment these commitments absorb practically the whole of the proceeds fromthe sale of securities.      It is proposed to discuss the matter again in September.(f) Co-operation in evolving a scheme designed to relieve the United Kingdom of the heavy drain of emigrant remittancesto Canada.      On our figures this liability is about  27 millions per annum.      The Canadian figures are a good deal lower and the

Canadians have also pointed out that much the greater part ofthe liability relates to commitments undertaken to allowemigrants who have already gone to Canada to transfer funds of limited amount over a period of four years.     They did,however, undertake to examine,whether there was any way inwhich Canada could help.On the whole it would seem better to leave most,if not all, of these Canadian points to be pursued inSeptember.H.W.Board of Trade, S.W. .1.27TH JULY, 1949.
