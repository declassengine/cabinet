THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. ,i:Augustitl$4$SECRET4th August,m-   cabinet government expenditure memorandum by the Prime Minister&apos; Atthe time of the last Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer stressed theimportance of preventing the expansion of Government expenditure from out-running the increase in national production; and in the Treasury circularT.C. No. 2/49 of 6th April Departments were warned that supplementary estimates would not be allowed unless they were necessitated by a major changeof policy or similar exceptional circumstances.2: The Cabinet have recently held a comprehensive review of the economicsituation, ,in the course of which they have had before them an estimate(E,P*C.. (49) 76) of the prospective increase of Government expenditure in thenext two/years, arid-they are satisfied that the present economic circumstancesmake it necessary, not only to avoid new increases in expenditure, but to introducemeasures of retrenchment if only to offset the increases which must automaticallyfollow from the expansion of policies already approved.- 3. 1 therefore ask all Ministers in charge of Civil Departments to undertakeforthwith a searching scrutiny of the expenditure for which they are responsible,with a view to finding measures of ^economy under the following two heads : (a) Curtailment of services which are not essential; to major government policy. I am satisfied that there are many such services which, though they may have seemed useful and promising when they were started,must now be regarded as luxuries which in present circumstances wecannot afford. Some could be cut out entirely, without, prejudice to major Government policy/The development of others could beretarded and spread over a longer period in order to reduce current expenditure.*   37392 :&apos;Copy No.
(b) More economical administration of policies which must be retained.Under this head I am confident that there is room for a reallysubstantial reduction in the numbers of Government staffs. I look to Ministers to take a personal initiative in overcoming the traditionalreluctance of Departments to effect any reduction in their numbers.4. Circumstances differ from one Department to another and Ii^affidnottherefore proposing a uniform percentage cut in the expenditure of each;,Departrment. What I ask is that the maximum practicable economy shallbe vigorouslyenforced in every Department. It may help Ministers, however- in preparingtheir proposals, to know that my general aim is to secure a reduction bi about per cent, in the total rate of Government supply expenditure. I intend thatthe detailed measures necessary to secure a result of this magnitude shall be reviewed, and final decisions taken, by the Economic Policy Committee. I thinkit would assist the Committee to reach decisions which would be fair all roundif any Minister who is unable to offer means of reducing his rate of net expenditure by 5 per cent, by measures within 3 (a) and 3 (ft) would also indicate what further action would have to be taken if his rate of expenditure had to be reduced bythat figure. Any measures affecting Government policy would have to be treatedas strictly confidential at this stage.5. The position of the Defence Departments differs from that of the civil departments in several ways and the terms of&apos; the two preceding paragraphs arenot entirely appropriate to them. I am issuing a separate instruction to theDefence Ministers.6. I have asked the Permanent Secretary of the Treasury to ensure that this review of current expenditure goes forward in all Departments with the necessaryspeed and on a comparable, basis; and he will be getting into touch with thePermanent Secretaries of all Departments- for this purpose.It is my desire that final decisions should, be take it by the Economic PolicyCommittee in September. For this purpose I shall be glad if vou will let me haveyour proposals by the middle of September.;;: C. R. A. ;10, Downing Street, S. W. 1,1th August, 1949.
