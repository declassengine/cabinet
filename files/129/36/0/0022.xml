US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.x^(u10) 17211&apos;JH AUGUST. 19^9CABINETTHE DOLLAR SITUATION;    CANADANote by tho Prime minister on 29th. July the Cabinet &quot;agreed that an approach should be made to the Canadian Government before theWashington talks in September about the basis of Canadafslong-term trade relations with the sterling area and thatthe United Kingdom High Commissioner in Ottawa should be recalled to London to advise on the manner in which the approach should be made&quot; (C.M.(l4-9) 51st Conclusions, Minute 2).I have now had an opportunity of discussing thisquestion with Sir Alexander Clutterbuck.   For reasons whichI will explain orally to ray colleagues he strongly advisesthat no approach should be made to the Canadian Governmenton this long-terra problem in advance of the washington disscusions.   He -considers that any immediate approach shouldbe confined to the current difficulties arising from theadministration of the European Recovery Programme by theUnited States Government.I recommend that the High Commissioner should beauthorised, immediately upon his return to Ottawa, to take up this particular question with the Canadian Government and to hand to them an aide memoire in the terms of the attached draft.The long-term problem of Canada&apos;s future trade relations with the sterling area should, in my view, bediscussed further with the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellorof the Exchequer when we consider with them later in themonth the general conduct of their forthcoming negotiations in Washington. ,C.R.A.10 Downing street, S.W.I.,11th August, 19^9*COPY NO. 3 f

DRAFT MEMORANDUM TO BE HANDED BY SIR ALEXANDER CLUTTERBUCKTO THE CANADIAN AUTHORITIES -1. The dollar difficulties of the United Kingdom show no signs of easing:    the standstill on new dollar imports which was, regrettably, forced on the United Kingdom and the &apos;other members of the sterling area is at best a form ofemergency action and cannot take full effect for several months.In the meantime, as the following figures show, the positioncontinues to be one of increasing gravity.April     May;        June      July mGold and dollar deficit 37 56 63 57*Decrease in gold and 11 31 23 37dollar holdings^ProvisionalThus, the United Kingdom gold and dollar holdings fell from 1+71 millions at the end of March to  369 millions at the endof July.2. It was recognised in the meetings with Mr, Abbott andMr. Snyder that the present difficulties could not be resolved by unilateral action by any one country alone, and that each ofour three countries has a part to play in overcoming them.   Inthe subsequent Commonwealth meetings recommendations were madeto Governments outlining in broad terms the objectives at whichdebtor countries on the one hand, and creditor countries on theother, should aim.   The United Kingdom Government for their partfully endorse these recommendations and are giving urgent consideration to the best means of implementing them.   They are determined to play their full part in the solution of thepresent difficulties and they have no doubt that, in the samespirit, the Canadian Government will be considering, in preparatifor the forthcoming discussions what measures can be taken inCanada to relieve the present strain.

5* - Meanwhile,  this preparatory work, . in conjunction withthe continuing dollar drain outlined in paragraph 1 above, hasdemonstrated that quite apart from the fundamental question ofthe level of trade which can in the long run be sustained bctvreenthe dollar and the sterling areas, the ineligibility forE.R* finance of certain major United Kingdom purchases from canada presents a major obstacle to the maintenance of currentUnited Kingdom/Canadian trade at a reasonable level, and is ofcrucial importance to tho whole complex of United Kingdom/Canada trade relations.k. Last March, on the urgent advice of the Economic Co-operation Administration (E.C.A.)?  the United Kingdom v/lthdrow itsrequest for the further use of E.R.J?. funds for Canadian whe at.Had this step not been taken we were advised that the UnitedStates Secretary for Agriculture would have formally declaredwheat a surplus commodity ineligible for off-shore purchasesunder E.R.--1.    It was then hoped that it would be possible forthe United Kingdom to re-arrange its purchasing programme sothat E.R.xJ. dollars could be expended on other essential commodities, while wheat could be bought from the free dollarsthus released.5. Since April E.C.A. have also refused to finance theUnited Kingdom/Canadian che*ese contract and as from Octoberthere is a strong probability that Canadian bacon will beineligible.   In addition E.C.A. have felt unable to financeexisting contracts for pulp, paper and timber, unless they havebeen thrown open to competition with U.S.A. producers.   Duringthe last quarter of this year there may also bo difficultyin financing off-shore purchases of non-ferrous metals.6, In all, this means that some $500 millions may beineligible for E.C.A. financing, of which Canadian purchases

under existing commitments total 0395 millions, made up asfollows:-Canadian wheat and flour 309Canadian cheese 15Canadian &quot;bacon 13Canadian eggs 17Canadian pulp and paper .    . 10Canadian timber 23Canadian tobacco _8Total 195.There is also expenditure of 0101 millions- on non-Canadian items which, are either ineligible or which cannot be documentedunder existing procedures, making a grand total of 0496 millions,7. It is necessary to draw a distinction in these itemsbetween those on which a decision lies with E.CA. and theagricultural commodities which are,- or may be, declared surplusby the Secretary for Agriculture,   The major item in the lattercategory is wheat.   Here, if the Secretary for Agriculturedeclares wheat surplus, E.CA. have no option under existingleglslatjon;    they must refuse it for E.C.A. financing.    Ofthe other items, cheese, bacon, eggs and tobacco (totalling053 millions) are in the same category.8, As stated in paragraph 4 above it had been hopedthat it would be possible to re-arrange the United Kingdompurchasing programme so that E*R,I5. dollars could be expendedon other essential commodities while wheat could be bought fromthe free dollars so released.   This, however, is not possible,&apos;9. On the basis of present estimates there should be at best 69 million free dollars available for purchases by theUnited Kingdom made up as follows:-0m .United Kingdom exports 4. 620Net invisibles - 197Rest of Sterling Area - 188Gold and dollar settlements - 243Capitol transactions *   I4.2Imports that can be paid for fromearned dollars 34Invisible expenditure eligible forE.C.A. finance (say) 35Total &quot;5*9

But as stated above (paragraph. 6), Canadian items on the .programme amount to  395 millions.10. This position is, therefore, one of extreme gravity.Its gravity is increased by the fact that the United Kingdomcannot by any operation on its own import programme increasetho number of free dollars available.   All eligible items whichcan bo documented are already financed from E.R.P.:    even if wocut theso to nothing there would be no more froo dollarsavailable.   Relief can only come,  therefore, by real savings on the items listed in paragraph 9 above.   It is true thatthis figure of 063 millions is a provisional estimate   the true figure may be higher, for the other Commonwealth countries may make bigger not dollar savings than we have assumed.   Butit may be worse, for the present rate of deficit is very much larger, than the forecast used for this calculation.    It would be wrong, therefore,  to base any hopes of a solution of the problemon these grounds.11* The general position has been put to E.C.A. who havenot been able to hold out any hope that they could take action.to change the legislative position which binds them on allagricultural commodities if they are declared surplus.    Ofthese by far the major item is wheat.    On this the only solution which they can see is that wheat crops in the U.S.A. might be such that the Secretary for Agriculture can say that it is nota surplus commodity.    This is doubtful.   But unless it happensthe. United Kingdom will have E.R.13. funds which it cannot&apos;spendon essential needs.    In a word, the whole purpose.of the ForeignAssistance .Act is defeated.   For, if this state of affairscontinues, it is evident that the volume of purchases from canada which would require to be financed from free dollarswould far exceed the amount of these dollars available to theUnited Kingdom and we would only be able to pay for our importsfrom Canada by using dollars from the reserves.

12. Slaving regard to. the necessity for preserving these .reserves at (and indeed re-building them to) a reasonableworking level, the United Kingdom Government considor that this further drain on them must not be allowed to occur.   As stated above, representations to the E.C.A. authorities about the urgonand importance of this problem have already been made, but itis clear that it is one which will have to be raised at high levels in Washington.   It is hoped that the canadian government, appreciating its gravity and its crucial effecton the United Kingdom&apos;s purchasing power in Canada, will feel able to assist the United Kingdom Government in whatever wayswould seem to be most effective to secure a solutionsatisfactory to both Governments,10th August, I9h9
