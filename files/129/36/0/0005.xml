Owing toSeretse having been a minor when his father died, his uncle Tshekedi has been for a considerable time the Acting Chief of the Tribe and has achieved the positionof being one of the most prominent Africans in South Africa. Under the localnative custom the Chieftainship is hereditary, descending from the father tothe eldest son, but the local Native Administration Proclamation provides that,upon the occurrence of a vacancy in the Chieftainship, the tribe must designatethe former Chiefs successor according to native customs and cause the name tobe submitted to the Resident Commissioner, with a view to seeking the high commissioners recognition and the Secretary of State&apos;s confirmation of suchdesignation.2. Seretse, who is now a man of 27, has had an unusually prolongededucation, which was arranged for him by Tshekedi at the cost of tribal funds.He was sent two years ago to England, where he spent a year at Balliol College,Oxford, and afterwards became a law student at London University. When inLondon he met an English girl- Ruth Williams at some social function for colonial students, and they were married last year, in spite of vigorous warningsgiven to both parties by interested friends that such a marriage would be resentedby the Bamangwato tribe. Ruth Williams is, apparently, a fairly well educatedgirl, interested in Church matters, and there is nothing against her characterpersonally.3. Shortly after the marriage, Seretse proceeded by air to South africa to discuss his position with the tribe. A series of meetings took place and thelocal Resident Commissioner reported that, although there was no opposition toSeretse&apos;s claim to be chief, there was almost solid disapproval of the marriageamong the Bamangwato. This disapproval was based upon the following grounds: &apos;(a) General racial bias.(&amp;) Seretse&apos;s neglect to conform to the formalities required in an Africanmarriage.(c) Aversion to a possible half-caste heir.The result Was that Seretse returned to England to complete his law studies andthe position remained unresolved.4.   Last month Seretse went out again by air to the Bechuanaland Protec-torate and further meetings were held. Tshekedi and his chief followers reiteratedtheir strong objection to the marriage which Seretse had made.   At the finalmeeting, however, Seretse made an emotional appeal, which resulted in a very37285SECRETCP. (49) 15519*A July, 1949
large majority of those present acclaiming him as the hereditary heir to theChief tainship. The High Commissioner states that it would appear that consti-tutional questions regarding the marriage were rather submerged in the processand that the implications of the marriage were not defined. Tshekedi subsequentlymade a formal statement to the effect that tradition was being so severely flouted,j il and native law and custom so abused, that he proposed, having wound up his administration, to leave the Bamangwato Reserve, and he declared that he would never concur in acceptance of a white woman as the Chiefs first or principalwife.5. In the ordinary course, the signification of approval by the majority ofthe tribe would be regarded as an adequate ground for proceeding to recogniseSeretse. It appears, however, that the recent meetings were not very fully repre-sentative of the tribe as a whole, since those present included more than halfthe men of the tribal capital, but only about one-fiftieth of those in the country districts. There had also evidently been a good deal of propaganda by certain members of the tribe who nurse various personal grievances against Tshekedi.Nevertheless, it is surprising that there should have been such a sudden reversal of the opinion expressed by the great majority of the tribe last year. The HighCommissioner states that the local administrative aspects are such that he feelsgreat hesitation about the immediate recognition of Seretse. In his opinion, the doubts cast upon the representative character of the assembly, the indefinitenature of the decisions taken at it, the obscurities relating to the status and position of Seretse&apos;s wife and any children of the marriage, and the dangers of a split in the tribe and of a breakdown of native administration, are sufficientreasons for holding some further enquiry, which would allow time for aconsideredverdict.,    .6. There are, moreover, other wider considerations involved. The suggestionthat we should recognise a chief who is married to a white woman has causedintense feeling among Europeans, both in the Union of South Africa and in southern Rhodesia. Representations have been made to me by the High Commis-sioner for the Union in London, on behalf of his Government, to the effect thattho repercussions in the Union of a white woman becoming the Chief tainess inan African tribe will be extremely grave. Similar views have also been expressed to our High Commissioner, Sir Evelyn Baring, by the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia. Sir Evelyn Baring reports that information which he has received,from such a reliable authority as the Secretary of the Department of external affairs, has convinced him that this matter is the gravest which has faced ussince he first went to South Africa. It is suggested that the more extremeNationalists will argue that the recognition of Seretse would demonstrate thefolly of allowing the existence side by side in Southern Africa of two systems of native administration diametrically opposed to one another. They would say that South Africans should not and cannot remain associated with a country which recognises officially an African Chief married to a white woman, and theywould make Seretse&apos;s recognition the occasion of an appeal to the country forthe establishment of a Republic, and not only of a Republic, but of a Republicoutside the Commonwealth. Sir Evelyn Baring states that the South AfricanPrime Minister is desperately worried and feels that he could not successfullyoppose an extremist offensive on these lines. It must be remembered in thisconnection that the Union Government have a particularly close interest in the bechuanaland Protectorate, since this is one of the territories which, in view ofthe provisions in the South Africa Act of 1909, they look upon as due to betransferred to the Union. The question of such transfer has been frequentlyraised by the Union Government and, quite apart, therefore, from the graverpossibilities indicated above, the demand for the transfer of the High commission territories might clearly become more insistent if We disregarded the UnionGovernments views in a matter of this kind in relation to one of these territories.The fact that Dr. Malan is feeling extreme anxiety, rather than jubilation, atthe present development, is evidence that the threat to the Commonwealth relation-ship must be taken seriously. Indeed, we cannot exclude the possibility of an armed incursion into the Bechuanaland Protectorate from the Union if Seretsewere to be recognised forthwith, while feeling on the subject is inflamed.7. In all these circumstances it seems clearly important that a decision infavour of Seretse&apos;s recognition, if it is ever to be taken, should not be rushed, and
that there should be due time for reflection, and enquiry. In the bechuanaland protectorate Native Administration Proclamation there is a provision to the effectthat, if any doubt arises whether a person designated as chief is worthy or capableof exercising that office justly, or for any other sufficient reasons is a fit and properperson to discharge the functions of chief, the High Commissioner may direct thata judicial enquiry should be held to enquire into the matter and to report thereonto the High Commissioner, who shall then decide the matter. The High Com-missioner accordingly proposes that use should be made of this provision and thatan enquiry should be held, presided over by the Judge of the High Courts of theHigh Commission Territories, to investigate Seretse&apos;s suitability for the Chief-tainsbip and the true views of the tribe. During the interval the present Regencywould continue. It is proposed that the Judge should be assisted by two other officers, one of whom might be the Government Secretary of the bechuanaland protectorate and the other possibly a retired administrative officer from one ofthe other two High Commission Territories.8. There appear to be two possible courses of action. We could declarenow that we could not recognise Seretse in view of his disregard of the nativecustom in the matter of his marriage. The Local Administration, indeed, feelthat if we are ever to take this line, it would be better to do so now. Sir EvelynBaring has, however, explained that he has assumed that the United KingdomGovernment would not be prepared to declare forthwith that Seretse cannot berecognised as Chief simply on the ground that an African married to a Europeanwoman cannot successfully perform the functions of a Chief. The other courseof a judicial enquiry, which Sir Evelyn Baring has advocated as an alternative to immediate refusal to recognise Seretse, would at least demonstrate, both in theUnion of South Africa and in Southern Rhodesia, that the Protectorate author-ities and the United Kingdom Government were mindful of the gravity of the issues involved. It cannot, of course, be assumed that the enquiry would resultin a report unfavourable to the recognition of Seretse. But the eventual decisions would still remain with the High Commissioner and a careful enquiry into allthe issues should have resulted in the presentation of a report which would set outfully the pros and cons, and would provide clearer material for a decision thanexists at present.9. I am still in communication with the High Commissioner on various aspects of the matter, and I will shortly be able to present a further report to mycolleagues. This preliminary paper has been prepared in advance of furtheradvice from the High Commissioner, since it is important that a decision shouldbe announced as soon as possible. Seretse&apos;s wife is likely to leave for SouthAfrica within a short time, and, if she joins him there before we have made any announcement, the position will have become much more difficult, since the presswould sensationally represent this as the arrival of a white &quot; Chieftainess.&quot; Itwould be very difficult to overtake the implications of this, and any subsequentannouncement would look like a harassed rear-guard action. The High Com-missioner is anxious therefore to be authorised to make an announcement by23rd July, when he is visiting Mafeking, and will be able to see both Seretse andTshekedi, and so could first inform them personally.10. In the light of the above, and of the further report which I hope to make,a decision has to be taken between (i) declaring now that Seretse is not recognised,and (ii) announcing the appointment of a judicial enquiry.P.
