1 Jt/f/fifHIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY*S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1949SECRETCopy No. 31CP. (49) 190Uth September, 1949CABINETNATIONAL HEALTHSERVICEUSE OF THE SERVICE BY ALIENS IN THIS COUNTRY ANDPOSSIBILITIES OF RECIPROCAL ARRANGEMENTS IN OTHERCOUNTRIESThe Cabinet, at a meeting on 30th June, 1949 (CM. (49) 43rd Conclusions,.Minute 8 (2)) invited the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Health toconsider what might be done to improve reciprocal health service facilities withthe Brussels Powers. I prepared a draft paper for prior discussion with theForeign Secretary, but he has been unable under present pressure to considerit. I therefore submit this paper alone, and I must emphasise that it has not beenagreed with the Foreign Secretary.Application of the Health Service to Aliens2. The National Health Service Act, 1946, extends all its provisions to anyalien, while in this country, without charge. There has been some criticism ofthis, in two forms 3. As to (a), there seems to be no real doubt. It is true that Section 1 speaksof the Minister promoting a service designed to improve the health of the&quot; people of England and Wales.&quot; But it goes on to require the effective provisionof all the services to be later explained in the Act. Then the Act sets out everyservice hospitals, local authorities, doctors, &amp;c. and for each creates a dutythat it is not limited to our own people at all. Most opinion agrees that the aliensare covered, and that any doubt of legality can be discounted. People coming tothis country are told this, in a leaflet handed to them on arrival. The onlyexception is that we do not extend the facilities of the service to anyone whom we know to have come over merely to obtain them. There cannot be a completecheck but my officials have an arrangement with the immigration officials of theHome Office, which is designed to identify cases, for example, where the purposeof visit is a surgical operation or similar purpose.4. As to (b), has it been right to extend the Act to aliens ? First, it wouldhave been difficult not to. In a universal free service, not dependent on insuranceor other qualification, it would have involved a mammoth organisation to check the nationality of every patient arriving in hospitals, or at the doctonor dentists&apos;surgeries, the optician, or elsewhere. Second, and more positively, it is surely avery worth-while gesture, and an inexpensive piece of practical propaganda at atime of the furthering of good relations with the Western European countries.It is a unique service, which interests other countries, and which it pays us to memorandum by the Minister of Health(a) does it do so lawfully, and(b) ought it to do so ?37578
encourage them to follow. A good way to fertilise the idea among them is to lettheir nationals not only see, but use it.] 5. What of the cost? It is important to differentiate between the residentalien who is an ordinary citizen here, paying his contributions and dues andthe visiting alien, who is our real concern.6. In 1948 there were 633,000 foreign visitors to the United Kingdom, and95,000 stayed more than six months. The rest were holiday visitors (335,000),business visitors (90,000), and those in transit (65,000). The great majority wouldmake little use of the service compared with our own use, being here for only avery short time. The average stay of all is probably less than a month, so thattheir total is equal to anything up to 50,000 fixed population, while their callon the service would be minimal compared with that of a settled population.Allow it, however, to be rather more than one-half of the normal call, this estimatewould suggest about  200,000 (probably very much less) during 1949-50.Possibilities of Reciprocal Arrangements7. This all supports the policy of making no general restriction againstthe alien visitor. But, at the same time, we should clearly endeavour to get what-ever we reasonably can from other countries by reciprocal arrangements, and discussions to that purpose should be pressed.8. Already some discussions have taken place, in a special Sub-committee set up from the Social Security Sub-Committee and the Public Health Committeeof the Official Committee. This is mentioned in paragraph 10 of the Reportappended to OP. (49) 131 dated 7th June, 1949. A draft Convention being con-sidered between the Brussels Treaty Powers provides broadly that each country will provide for nationals of the other countries in the same way as for theirown if (a) they are normally resident in that country and (6) they are indigentand without resources. There is provision for repatriation if assistance is likelyto be long and costly and the person has been in that country less than five years,or has no close family attachments there.9. Thus the present negotiations have only been dealing with residentaliens, not visitors, and then only with the indigent; and they have not reallybegun to tackle the main &quot; visitor &quot; problem. Nor, in the case of residents, arewe likely to get much more from other countries as, to go beyond &quot; indigence,&quot;would be to give our resident nationals more than their own which would be too much to expect. For the same reason, if we start similar discussions on&quot; visitors,&quot; who are our real concern, we are probably not likely to get very muchat present, as these &quot; indigence tests &quot; would automatically exclude the ordinaryvisitor, who would not be without resources.10.   Yet I still suggest that we should do whatever we can to widen thef)resent negotiations and endeavour to cover both residents and visitors or at East visitors on terms more favourable than we have yet reached. There is not much ground for optimism, perhaps, as it would be asking a country to do more for our visitors than they do for their own people, and it may well be that we get little as a result except some principle of reciprocity established. But the big thing is to keep the discussion going and to create a situation in whichf\pssibly some small concession might be obtained and might later lead to a moreruitful agreement.11. It may be thought desirable also to open discussions with other western countries not in the Brussels Treaty group, but this may follow more appropriatelya little later. The best vehicle of discussion seems to be in the Public HealthCommittee, or its Sub-Committees, of the Official Committee. Already a meetingon other items is arranged for October in Luxembourg, which my officials areattending and at which they could, if desired, propose the inclusion of this subject in the next following meeting.12.   To sum up, it is suggested (a) that there should be an endeavour made to achieve some degree of reciprocity with the Brussels Treaty Powers (and other western powers in due course) by opening discussions on the subject throughthe existing organisation under that Treaty; that my officials should conduct any such discussions in the first place, on a &quot; brief &quot; agreed with the Foreign Secretary;
(6) that discussions should give most emphasis to the visitor, and not the resident, and should press the point that as the visitor can get so muchover here, other countries ought to try to offer some quid fro quo toour visitors to them;(c) that no attempt be made to introduce any element of fee charging on our side, as a make-weight for the better services which we oner.13. Frankly, I expect little or nothing at the moment from such discussions.But they would have the value of helping to keep in view the quality of our ownservice and the inequality of what others had to offer; and they might becomein time the basis of pressure to improve some of the services in the west ofEurope with which we shall be most in contact.14. If this is agreed in principle, I suggest that the more detailed aspectsof method and machinery might be left to the Foreign Secretary and myself tosettle.A.
