THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1949Copy No.CABINETINVOLUNTARY ABSENTEEISM IN THE ROYAL ORDNANCEFACTORIESMemorandum by the Minister of supply at the meeting of the Cabinet on 2nd June (CM. (49) 40th Conclusions,Minute 3), I was invited to circulate a paper oil the recent increase in the rate ofinvoluntary absenteeism in the Royal Ordnance Factories.2. The scheme of paid sick leave for Government industrial employees,which came into operation on 1st September, 1948, and which is subject to review at the end of two years from that time, provides, in brief, that, after a qualifyingperiod of service of six months, employees may, in any period of one year, begranted sick leave with full pay up to a maximum of thirteen weeks, less anyNational Insurance benefit. Full pay means the employee&apos;s ordinary time rate,,but the first three days of sickness are not paid for unless absence extends to five days. After five years&apos; qualifying service a further period of leave on half paymay be given. The issue of pay is conditional upon production of medicalevidence of incapacity furnished by a qualified medical ^practitioner, and, inpractice, there is accepted for purposes of the Scheme the same certificate as isissued by the private doctor (normally National Health Service doctor) for national insurance purposes.3. The percentage of working days lost by industrial employees of the royal ordnance Factories on account of absence covered by medical certificate in eachof the months following the introduction of the Scheme, with comparable figuresfor the preceding five years, is shown in the following table : Month	1948-49	1947-48	1946-47	1945-46	1944-45	1943-4	Per	Per	Per	Per	Per	Per	cent.	cent	cent.	cent.	cent.	cent.September	3-5	2-5	3 0	4-7	5-7	6-2October	5 1	2-8	3-2	5-2	5-8	6-4November	6-0	2-9	3-4	5-3	5-4	7-4December	6 1	2-7	2-9	51	5-3	&apos;7-6January	7-6	3-2	4-5	6 1	6-7	7-2February	8-1	3 1	50	5-5	61	6-5March	9-0	2-7	4-3	4-8	5-3	61April ...	7 1	2-4	30	3-6	4-7	5-34. Even allowing for some variation in the incidence of sickness from yearto year, these figures show, that, taking the Royal Ordinance Factories as a whole,there was a marked increase in absences due to certified sickness compared withthe year preceding the introduction of the Scheme. The increase is not so markedif a comparison is made with earlier years, but the years 1943-45 were war yearswhen many of the employees were on a three-shift system, were suffering theeffects of fire-watching, black-out, long hours and difficult transport, and there37291SECRET       .CP.

was considerable employment of married women with domestic responsibilities.These factors no longer operate and, in addition, a five-day 44-hour working week was introduced in January 1947.5. Some rise in sickness absence rates was expected on the assumption thatjprior to the introduction of the Paid Sick Leave Scheme some workers could not afford to be away sick when their income in such circumstances was largelygoverned by the rates of National Health Insurance benefit in operation prior to july 1948 (a maximum of 18s. weekly for a man and less for women). These rates were increased in July 1948 (when the National Insurance Act, 1946, came intooperation), but the gap between sickness benefit and full wages is still considerable.6. Enquiries have produced no evidence of any marked increase in thegeneral level of sickness in industry at large since September 1948, nor could anyconsiderations peculiar to Royal Ordnance Factories be discovered which wouldaccount for an increased rate of sickness absenteeism in those Establishments.The conclusion is, therefore, reached that the rise in sickness absence in these factories is almost wholly due to the introduction of the Paid Sick Leave Scheme,of which employees were taking the fullest possible advantage.7. It is estimated that annual expenditure at the rate of  600,000 is beingnow incurred as a result of the Paid Sick Leave Scheme for no return in work.Apart from the cost, the high rates of absence are having an effect on the productivity of the various Royal Ordnance Factories which may be more markedthan the actual rates of sickness absence suggest, because there is considerabledislocation of group working arrangements.8. There is little doubt that the present rate of sick absence in the Factoriesis closely linked with the morale of the workers and their environmental conditions,and with their general sense of responsibility towards the privileges conferred by the Scheme. Thus, in the Royal Ordnance Factory, Glascoed, in South Wales,sickness absence since the introduction of the Paid Sick Leave Scheme has risensharply from about 4 per cent, to a peak of 17J per cent, in the case of maleworkers. (The figures for women were 7 per cent, and 20 per cent.) On theother hand at Woolwich, which is a long-established factory, situated in an area in which employment has been good and where there is a settled tradition amongthe workpeople, the increase in sick absence, while noticeable, has been much lessmarked i.e., from about 2 per cent, to 4^ per cent.9. There are many financial inducements which now encourage sick absence.It can attract worthwhile rebates and even repayment of income tax, and, underthe new Budget arrangements, National Insurance Sickness Benefit is itself nowfreed from tax. While the amount must vary widely in individual cases accordingto personal circumstances, such as prior earnings and the marital position, it isestimated that it could be of the order of  1 or more a week. To this must beadded savings in travelling expenses, and the combination of all these factors(including possible receipt of sick club benefits) may mean that the worker is better off financially when sick than when at work. This is not only an obviouschallenge to his honesty but it also raises a sociological question which has not hitherto become acute in Government industrial employment.10. I have no doubt that many Royal Ordnance Factory employees areremaining absent sick for as long as their doctors will certify them as unfit for duty. It is not unreasonable to assume that, in these days when increased work is being thrown on the individual doctor, normally the National Health Servicedoctor, much of the initiative for prompt return to duty (and for that matterrefraining from going off sick at the slightest pretext) must necessarily rest withthe employee himself.11. Although the factors influencing sick absence within the framework of the present Scheme &apos;can thus be assessed, it is not so easy to determine andapply a remedy. Since in present circumstances little or nothing can be done inthe way of tighter medical certification, the broad lines of approach would appearto be (a) some regularised system of welfare visitation which in addition to securing the earlier return to work of an employee who is doubtfully &apos;&apos; unfit&apos;&apos;might also bring to light cases where the &apos;&apos; unfit&apos;&apos; employee is undertaking privatework on his own account during sick absence and (6) the longer term policy ofeducating workpeople to a better sense of their responsibilities.
12. The problem has recently been considered on the Ministry of Supply-Joint Industrial Council and the matter is also coming up for re-examination at thenext meeting of the Joint Co-ordinating Committee for Government industrial establishments, due to take place on 28th July next. In addition, the joint parliamentary Secretary (Mr. Jack Jones, M.P.) who is Chairman of the Ministryof Supply Joint Industrial Council, and the Trade Union Vice-Chairman will beaddressing a number of meetings of the workpeople in the Factories on this matter.13.   Any amendment of the Scheme at the end of the two years&apos; trial period-either to secure that the total receipts (including any income tax concessions) of an employee when sick should not exceed his normal earnings when at work or toimprove the Scheme in other directions would be a matter for consideration by the-Joint Co-ordinating Committee for Government Industrial Establishments.G.
