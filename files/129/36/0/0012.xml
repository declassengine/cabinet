Whales becomefatter as the season advances and the later season shouldhave the effect of increasing the production of whale oil.The Commission had evidence before it that in December ofthe 19U8/u10 season the yield per blue whale unit averagedbetween 80 and 90 barrels, whereas in March it rose to1 q.O/150 barrels.Resolution 112,     That the regulation forbidding&apos; the taking of humpbackwhales by Factory Ships south of UO0 South latitude be amended so that a maximum of 1 ,250 humpback whales may &quot;betaken in this region during each of the pelagic whalingseasons 1949/1950 and 1950/1951.Explanatory NoteThis embargo came into force before the last war.     Atthe 1946 Conference held in Washington the United kingdom delegation had protested against its continuance, and, as. aresult, paragraph V of the Final Act of the Conference wasinserted to enable the Commission to consider the advisability of either the removal of the prohibition after the 1948/U9season and the southern-winter season of 191+9, or alternativelylimitation of the number of humpback whales to be taken bothin the Antarctic and tropical areas.Resolution 153, That, for clarification purposes, the following newpara, 10 be substituted for the existing para. 10 in theSchedule to the 19u7 Convention:-&quot;10. (a)    It is forbidden to use a land station.under the jurisdiction of a Contracting Government,and whale catchers attached to such land station, forthe purpose of taking or treating baleen whalesexcept as permitted by the Contracting Government inaccordance with sub-paragraph (b) of this paragraph&quot;.&quot;(b) Each Contracting Government shall declarefor all land stations under its jurisdiction, and whalecatchers attached to such land stations, one open seasonduring which the taking or treating of baleen whales

shall he permitted.     Such open season shall he for aperiod of not more than six consecutive months in any period of twelve months and shall apply to all landstations under the jurisdiction of a ContractingGovernment;    provided that a separate open season mayhe declared for any land station used for the takingor treating of baleen whales which is more than 1,000miles from the nearest.land station used for the takingor treating of baleen whales under the jurisdiction ofthe same Contracting Government1&apos;.&quot;(c) Notwithstanding the prohibition in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, the treatment ofwhales which have been taken during an open seasonmay be completed after the end of such open season&quot;.&quot;(d) The prohibitions contained in thisparagraph shall apply to all land stations as defined in Article II of the Whaling Convention of19h6 and to all factory ships which are subject to theregulations governing the operation of land stationsunder the provisions of paragraph 17 of this Schedule .Resolution lij.That the following new paragraph 17 be substituted forthe existing paragraph 17 in the Schedule to the Convention.&quot;17.(a)   A factory ship which operates solelywithin territorial waters in one of the areasspecified in sub-paragraph (c) of this paragraph, bypermission of the Government having jurisdiction over those waters, and which flies the flag of thatGovernment, shall, while so operating, be subject tothe regulations governing the operation of landstations and not to the regulations governing theoperation of factory ships&quot;.&quot;(b)    Such factory ship shall not, within a periodof one year from the termination of the season in which she so operated, be used for the ptu&quot;pose of treatingbaleen whales in any of the other areas specified in sub-paragraph (c) of this paragraph or south of k00South latitude&quot;.!,(c)   The areas referred to in sub-paragraphs(a) and (b) are:-(1) on the coast of Madagascar and itsdependencies;(2) on   the west coasts of French Africa;

(3)    on the coasts of Australia, namelyon the whole of the east coast and onthe west coast in the area known asShark Bay and northward to NorthwestCape and including Exraouth Gulf and king George&apos;s Sound, including thePort of Albany&quot;.Explanatory note the Commission considered that these paragraphs were capable of differing interpretations by the contracting governments and they have been re-drafted in order tosecure uniform interpretation and application of theprovisions of the Schedule.

To express its gratitude to the President Of the United States of America,Harry S. Truman, for his initiative in convening the present Conference andfor its preparation;2. To express to its Chairmah/Remington Kellogg, its deep appreciationfor the admirable manner in which he has guided the Conference;3. To express to the officers and staff of the Secretariat its appreciationfor their untiring services and diligent efforts in contributing to the attainment of the objectives of the Conference.II    &apos;The International Whaling Conference &quot;-resolves:That the Government of the United States of America, be authorized to publish the Final Act of this Conference, the text of the Convention and of
the Protocol, and to make available for publication such additional documents in connection with the work of this Conference as in its judgment may beconsidered in the public interest..&apos; hi       &apos;     &apos;The International Whaling Conferenceresolves:That all signatory Governments should draw the attention of theirinspectors and of the whaling companies operating under their jurisdictionto previous cases of taking baleen whales in the closed season on the pretextof providing fenders for the bunkering of whale catchers. The Conferencedesires to emphasize that this practice constitutes an infringement of paragraph  of the Schedule, annexed to the Convention and recommends that if it is desired to send whale catchers long distances in the open stea before thecommencement of, or after the-end of the whaling season, suitable arrangements must be made for bunkering them without the use of carcasses of baleenwhales.iv -      ;The International Whaling Conferencerecommends:That the chart of Nomenclature of Whales annexed to this Final Actbe accepted as a guide by the Governments, represented at the Conference.VThe International Whaling Conferencerecommends: ;.. .That the International Whaling Commission provided for in Article iii of the Convention (hereinafter referred to as the Commission), should review the prohibition on the use of factory ships, or whale catchers attached thereto,for the purpose of taking humpback whales in any waters south of 400 SouthLatitude after taking into consideration the biological&quot; and other data available and consider the desirability of either the removal of the prohibition afterthe 1948-49 season and the southern winter season of 1949, or alternatively a limitation of the number of humpback whales to be taken both in the Antarticand tropical areas.VI    *The International Whaling Conferencerecommends: /That the Commission should keep under constant review the questionof the limits of the Antartic whaling season and also the maximum numberof blue-whale units as defined by paragraph 8 (b) of the Schedule permitted;to be taken during the season.VII.The International Whaling Conferenceconsiders:That the conditions relating to the use of factory ships within territorial waters of Contracting Governments as provided by paragraph 17 of the^Schedule should be kept under review by the Commission so as to insurethat these operations are conducted on an economic basis.
- .    VIII .vThe. International Whaling Conferencerecommends: &apos;.&apos; -  -   .: That when adequate: information becomes available concerning the migration routes and seasons in localities where land stations are maintained and operated, specific annual open periods for whaling should be prescribedinstead of the regulation included in the Schedule as paragraph 10. It isthe view of the Conference that the Commission should endeavour to obtainat the earliest possible time scientific information as a basis for prescribingspecific seasons during which land stations shall be permitted to operate inthe various areas.At the request of the Delegation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,the following statements are included: -1. Owing to unforeseen circumstances the Soviet factory ship will be unable to reach the whaling grounds by the commencement of the 1946-47.season in waters south of 40 0 South Latitude. Accordingly the delegation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics request that this ship&quot; be permitted to operate with a full complement of catchers for a continuous period of four months from the date on which it is able to commence operations in that area. Note, is made that a similar concession was made to other governments for the season 1945-46.2. The Delegation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics also requeststhat the factory ship be permitted to conduct operations in that area for thefour-month period during the season 1946-47, without regard to the sixteenthousand blue-whale unit catch limitation.The Conference supports these requests and considers them justified inthe special circumstances. It is understood that support by the Conferenceof these requests shall not be regarded as a precedent for future seasons.-    &apos;        X       &quot;    &apos; . &quot;The International Whaling Conferencesupports:And considers justified the request of the Delegation of the Union of soviet Socialist Republics that the taking of gray whales in the Bering andChukotsk seas should be permitted when the meat and products of such whalesare to be used exclusively for local consumption by the aborigines of theChukotsk and Korjaksk areas.XI &apos;The International Whaling Conferencerecognizes:The desirability of achieving a large measure of uniformity among thevarious Contracting Governments with respect to the nature and severity ofpenalties imposed, for contraventions of the Convention, upon persons orships operating under their jurisdiction. It recognizes that even under themost favourable management and with the most conscientious and experiencedgunners and crews, it is inevitable that some whales will be taken illegallyand that a certain latitude should be allowed in assessing penalties for suchunavoidable taking. It may be that legal and administrative differencesamong the Contracting Governments will prevent the adoption of a uniformsystem of penalties, but it is the view of the Conference that it is desirable
that the Governments should provide for the imposition of penalties sufficientlysevere to discourage the illegal killing or taking of whales. .The Conference accordingly recommends that the Commission shouldstudy the reports regarding infractions made to them in accordance with theprovisions of Article IX, 4, of the Convention, with a view to making recom-mendations to Governments as provided for in Article VI of the convention for the purpose of achieving the greatest possible uniformity in the penaltiesimposed for contraventions of the Convention. &quot;In witness whereof, the following representatives sign this Final Act.Done in Washington, this second day of December, 1946, in the&apos; english language, the original of which shall be, deposited in the archives of theGovernment of the United States of America. The Government of the UnitedStates of America shall transmit certified copies thereof to all the OtherGovernments represented at the Conference.- [Here follow the signatures of the Plenipotentiary and Observer Delegates;]

ADDENDUMAs a result of the discussion of certain matters raised at the Conference,the Netherlands Delegate invited the Conference to include in its Final Acta resolution in the following terms:&quot; The Conference recommends that in the interest of effective con-sefvation and development of whale stocks the Governments - represented1 at the Conference refrain from taking any measures which might prevent any country adhering to the principles of the international whalingagreements from ratifying or entering into the international regulations&quot;&quot;for the preservation of whale stocks.&quot;This resolution was, however, defeated by nine votes to three, someDelegates disagreeing with the substance of the resolution and others con-sidering that it contained implications outside the purview of the Conference.At the express request of the Netherlands Delegate these facts are recorded in this addendum to the Final Act.
