C^jJLUai    12-114IS DOCUMENT IS   THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 194926SECRET-----sa -.....&apos;(49) 18?7th September, 1949CABINETDISCUSSIONS WITH THE MALTA government memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies my colleagues may like to have for information a note on the recent discussions with representatives of the Malta Government.Background to the Discussions2. Malta is self-governing in internal matters and the Maltese Ministers have complete constitutional responsibility for the Colony&apos;s finances and economy; Itis fully recognised that the economy of the Island, being largely dependent (as theWoods Report of 1945 Colonial No. 196-made plain) on invisible exports in theform of labour for the United Kingdom Service Departments, constitutes a long-term problem which in a few years time may present the Malta Government with serious difficulties; The rapidly increasing population, which continues to over-take the current rate of emigration, is a major factor in the problem.3; On the information available to the Colonial Office, however, there is no immediate financial crisis. The reserves of the Malta Government stood at nearly 2 million (annual revenue about  5 million) at the end of the last financial year;and most of Malta&apos;s allocation under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act( 1 million) together with two-thirds of the grant of  31 million from HisMajesty&apos;s Government under the Malta Reconstruction Act, remain unspent.4. The Malta (Labour) Government, which took office in 1947 when self-government was restored, are; however, committed by their election programme to large measures of social improvement. They have introduced an Old Age pensions scheme, costing  365,000 a year, and wish to have a National Health and InsuranceScheme on the lines of our own. To help pay for these measures, they have success-fully increased indirect taxation and introduced Income Tax. They have never-theless grown increasingly concerned about finding the financial means to imple-ment their programme. Against this background, Mr. Mintoff, the Deputy PrimeMinister, conceived the idea that a solution to Malta&apos;s difficulties lay in *(a) claiming direct participation in the benefit of Marshall Aid on the grounds that Malta is a European territory with a war-shattered economy; and(b) seeking a continuation of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s contribution towards the cost of food subsidies in Malta.5. These ideas were tentatively put to the Colonial Office in June byMr. Mintoff, Who was then attending the Colonial Office Supplies Conference.Dr. Boffa and Mr. Mintoff returned towards the end of July to take up discussion on these and other points. The delegation chose their own time to come, submittedno papers on the major subjects (with the exception of food subsidies) and broughtno expert advisers with them. The real substance of the delegation^ request wasto obtain financial aid from His Majesty&apos;s Government; the means they suggested for obtaining such aid were, in any case, inappropriate; moreover, any request for aid could be considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government only against detailed information regarding Malta&apos;s financial arid economic needs.37550 B
Food Subsidies6. A total of  1,650,000 has been given by His Majesty&apos;s Government since1946 towards the cost of subsidising food and other essential commodities. It was announced in 1946 that these contributions would end with the financial year1947-48, but a further and final grant of  300,000 was made in 1948-49 in response to representations by the Malta Government. The delegation were warned before they came in July that His Majesty&apos;s Government had given their final answer onthis point and, in agreeing to extend the contribution last year, had already gonebeyond the period and amount originally determined. The Maltese Ministers now suggested that the contribution should be continued by the United KingdomService Departments, on the grounds that as a result of the policy of subsidisationthe latter obtained labour at artificially low wage rates. They were told at ameeting on 29th July that this was virtually a request for financial assistance, ina form which could not be considered appropriate, particularly in view of the con-stitutional position in Malta; and that, if subsidies were lowered or removed in malta, the Service Departments would continue to be guided by the general wagelevel in the Island. The delegation did not pursue their demand after receivingthis reply.Marshall A id7. The difficulties in regard to the request for Marshall Aid were firstexplained to Mr. Mintoff at a meeting at the Treasury on 3rd August, and subse-quently set out in the form of a memorandum which I handed to Dr. Boffa on15th August. Mr. MintofiE wished to finance with Marshall Aid dollars a pro-gramme of capital works, including an electric power station and other utilities;and to be able to use the counterpart sterling, which would be deposited by Maltaagainst these dollars, to finance emigration and new social services. Malta&apos;sessential dollar needs, however, are already met from the central dollar pool; she would therefore get no more dollars under Marshall Aid arrangements, as the samestandards of essentiality would have to be applied to requests for finance from theUnited Kingdom share of Marshall Aid appropriations. The use of counterpartsterling (in addition to requiring the approval of the Economic Co-operation- Administration) would involve a vote of Parliament. This in turn could only beconsidered against the background of a thorough examination of Malta&apos;s economic position, and in these circumstances there would be no real advantage to Malta in seeking assistance from this rather than from other sources of public funds.Financial and Economic Situation of Malta8. His Majesty&apos;s Government^ views on the financial requests were thusmade available to the Malta delegation at an early stage in the talks. BeforeDr. Boffa and Mr. Mintoff returned to Malta on 5th August to consult their colleagues, I told them that on their return to this country I would make availableto them further information regarding the conditions governing Marshall Aid.If they wished, I would also discuss the finances of Malta and the problem ofits future economic viability; but I again asked for further information aboutthe financial situation as without it His Majesty&apos;s Government could not forman adequate picture of the situation in Malta. Despite my continued references to this point, no effort was made to present factual information to me.until10th August when Mr. Mintoff put in a memorandum to the Colonial Office.This, however, merely renewed the request for Marshall Aid and did not provide adequate background material.9. When, therefore, Dr. Boffa took up the talks himself after Mr. Mintoff&apos;resignation on 15th August, I again reverted to the general financial and economicissues which lay behind all the representations which the delegation had made tome. I made it plain that I had no wish to prejudice in any way the constitutional position under which finance lay within the complete responsibility of the malta government; but I added that if Malta was in difficulty His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would be glad to study the situation with the Malta representatives on thebasis of factual information provided by them.10. Dr. Boffa recognised that there was no immediate financial or economiccrisis; but he took the view (which I share) that the longer-term outlook is not good and requires attention. The grants under the Malta Reconstruction Actand the Colonial Development and Welfare Act will be exhausted within four or five years; Service employment is also likely to fall; with the removal or reduction of food subsidies, the cost of living will probably rise; the population
continues to increase, and the search for new economic activities (which in any event the Woods Report concluded could only slightly modify but not radicallychange the dependence on the invisible export of labour) has so far producedlittle results. The economic situation will be strained unless new enterprisescan be started and, above all, the population reduced by emigration.11. I suggested to Dr. Boffa that ways of meeting the present and futuresituation could only be properly considered after a careful examination of thewhole economic and fiscal structure of Malta. It was for the Malta Governmentto institute such an enquiry if they wished; but such an objective study seemedto me to be a prerequisite if it were their desire to ask His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto assist in improving Malta&apos;s financial and economic position. Dr. Boffa there-fore proposed, subject to consultation with his colleagues, to invite an indepen-dent expert to carry out this examiation and advise on means of strengtheningMalta&apos;s finances and of improving its economy. I said we would gladly lendour good offices in finding such an expert.12. This position was reached with Dr. Boffa as early as 18th August; andcomparatively little time or attention has been devoted by him in the talks tothe fundamental economic and financial issues. He has throughout remainedentirely preoccupied with the Dockyard discharges and his own political position.Service Employment13. The Malta Government were informed in mid-July that discharges ofworkers in the Royal Dockyard would take place at the rate of 35 per week from29th July onwards, to a total of 1,200-1,300 during the financial year. this announcement brought tension locally, and on 27th July Dr. Boffa and Mr. Mintoffasked in London for deferment of the discharges pending examination of Malteseproposals for modifying their effect. After urgent consultation with theAdmiralty, they were informed that action could not be delayed while theseproposals were being examined. At a meeting on 3rd August I offered to arrangefor the delegation to meet the First Lord; but it was not until after the delega-tion&apos;s visit to Malta and Dr. BofiVs resumption of negotiations on 15th Augustthat further talks were possible. Since then the First Lord and myself have hadmany meetings with Dr. Boffa at his request.14. It was made plain to Dr. Boffa from the outset that the admiralty could not accept an obligation to maintain the present level of employment without regard to naval requirements or their own finances; and that any request for indefinite suspension of the discharges in fact implied that the economy ofthe Island should be artificially supported by subvention from Admiralty votes.This was an unacceptable and inappropriate way of providing United Kingdomassistance, if such assistance were in fact needed. Dr. Boffa accepted the cogencyof this view, but remained exercised by the immediate political difficulties which arose from continuation of the discharges. The Admiralty also examined the maltese suggestions for increasing the private work in the dockyard and other methods of modifying the effect of the discharges; but these did not afford any practical solution.15. In an attempt to meet Dr. Boffa&apos;s difficulties, I suggested to him many times that I would be prepared to ask the Admiralty to consider suspending thedischarges temporarily for two months or to reduce the rate of discharges in theearlier period, if this would be of help. Dr. Boffa always rejected this suggestion as being of no real value. On 23rd August, the First Lord again explained theinsuperable difficulties which prevented the Admiralty from agreeing to. anyindefinite suspension of the discharges and, later the same day, I informedDr. Boffa that no alteration of the Admiralty decision to reduce the personnel in the dockyards was practicable.16. After seeing the Prime Minister on 25th August, Dr. Boffa had a furtherinterview with me on 26th August, at which I confirmed that the War Office had now intimated that they could offer employment in Cyrenaica without delay for1,000-1,300 workmen from Malta, of a variety of skills. In addition, the AirMinistry had found it possible to review their programme of work in the island and hoped as a result to be able to stabilise the present level of employment up tothe end of the financial year and thereby avoid approximately 100 discharges.His Majesty&apos;s Government were also seeing in what way the facilities needed formaltality&apos;s emigration scheme might be expedited. Despite these developments andthe proposed arrangements for a financial enquiry, Dr. Boffa still saw no ground37550 b 2
for considering the earlier suggestion for suspending the discharges for a limited period, but insisted on "suspension until the proposed financial and economic enquiry was completed." I informed him that the latter could only be regarded as a proposal for indefinite suspension, and that the implication that there could be some direct connection between the results of the enquiry and the discharges was completely misleading. Dr. Boffa on 27th August made a final appeal on this point by letter to the Prime Minister. In his reply dated 29th August the Prime Minister made it clear that there could be no indefinite postponement of the discharges, which was the substance of Dr. Boffa&apos;s demand.

17. Dr. Boffa again saw me on 30th August and intimated that, although his view in regard to the value of the suggestion remained unaltered, he now desired an approach to be made to the Admiralty asking that discharges be postponed for two months. I held out no hope that the proposition could be reopened at this late stage, particularly after he had repeatedly rejected the suggestion and the Admiralty had proceeded accordingly. The First Lord agreed, however, that, provided the Malta Government were prepared to assure us that it would be of material assistance to them in handling the situation in Malta and that the Malta Government would stand firmly by this and the other arrangements resulting from the talks, an eight-weeks&apos; suspension could be granted, as a maximum concession-on the understanding that when discharges were resumed they would be at an increased rate to attain by 31st March, 1950, the same reduction in the level of dockyard employment that had been provided for in the original programme. Dr. Boffa at first refused to come and discuss this point with me but he subsequently relented and agreed to lay the proposition on this basis before his colleagues. The offers to assist in regard to employment in Cyrenaica and to the financial enquiry also remain open and await the results of Dr. Boffa&apos;s consultations in Malta. Dr. Boffa left for Malta on 6th September : in the last few days he withdrew from the position of constantly threatening his resignation which he had adopted throughout the talks, and seemed to be prepared to fight his political opponents in Malta. Up to the end, however, he continued to give unhelpful statements to the press, calculated to prejudice the discussions.

Political Situation

18. The discussions were complicated by the friction between Dr. Boffa and Mr, Mintoff, who has long been the leader of the more extreme wing of the Malta Labour Party. He advocated "toughness" in dealing with His Majesty&apos;s Government and attempted to keep his Prime Minister out of the talks. He was chiefly responsible for persuading the Maltese Cabinet to send the "ultimatum," a document signed by all Ministers (except the Minister of Justice, who was ill) which he presented to me on arriving back in London on 8th August I attach a copy (Annex). It had been preceded by an earlier statement, threatening negotiations not only with the United States but also with "another power," which I had refused to accept. I decided, with the Prime Minister&apos;s concurrence, that this second document must also be withdrawn before the talks continued Dr. Boffa, with whom I communicated in Malta through the Acting Governor, immediately came to London and with the unanimous support of his Cabinet, except Mr. Mintoff, agreed to withdraw it. Mr. Mintoff at once resigned from the Cabinet and returned to Malta, where he has since been busy with a political campaign against Dr. Boffa&apos;s handling of the negotiations.

19. Mr. Mintoff has undoubtedly succeeded in splitting the Labour Party, and the outcome remains uncertain. If Dr. Boffa&apos;s Government do hot feel able to stand firm on the results of the recent talks, or meet with strong opposition in the House of Assembly and collapse, a difficult political situation will result. There would then be a possibility that Mr. Mintoff&apos;s wing, of the Labour Party, in unholy alliance with the pro-Italian nationalists, would contest a general election strongly on an anti-British basis.

20. These developments, have, given some cause for disquiet about internal security in Malta. I have kept the Minister of Defence informed, and appropriate precautionary arrangements have been made.

Colonial Office,

7th September, 1949.


annex note presented by Malta Government on 8th AugustIn the course of all the various and prolonged conversations held at all levelswith the Colonial Office, the sorry plight of Malta as a result of the war and ofthe neglect of successive Colonial administrations has been made clear to theAuthorities in Great Britain. The British Government must realise the impossi-bility of the Maltese people solving their overwhelming economic difficulties withtheir own unaided resources. But the only response from the British government so far has been their unilateral decision to accelerate the impending disaster bythe discharge of 1,200 men from His Majesty&apos;s Dockyard in Malta.Careful and earnest consideration of all the points at issue has led the MaltaCabinet to resist all further postponement and cavilling by making known to theBritish Government their intentions.Should the British Governments decision on Malta&apos;s claim for direct partici-pation in Marshall Aid (a question first raised in September 1948) be postponedto a date later than 22nd August, 1949, or should an inadequate reply be givenby that date to Malta&apos;s just representations, the Government of Malta will lay thewhole dispute before their people, who will be asked to state in a nationalReferendum whether in the changed circumstances they wish to submit Malta&apos;scase to the United States of America with a view to Malta receiving economic aid and, as a &quot; quid pro quo,&quot; the United States making use of Malta as a base.
