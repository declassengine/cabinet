THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(u10)  15U15TH JULY, 19U-9CABINETTHE BERLIN AIRLIFTMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsThe Problem.When it became apparent at the recent Conference ofForeign Ministers that a limited agreement would be concluded,providing for the maintenance of the New York Agreement andan improvement in the land communications between Berlin andthe Western zones, I gave careful consideration to the future^of the Berlin airlift.      It seemed to me that it would be imprudent to liquidate the organisation until the situation was clearer and until we had accumulated in Berlin sufficientstocks to see us safely over the winter in the event of thereimposition of the blockade.      I calculated that for thispurpose five months1 stocks would be required (i.e. to cover the period from 1st November, 1949, to 1st April, 1950), andI instructed the Military Governor to prepare an estimateshowing what target figure would be required for this purpose.General Robertson replied that approximately 1,100,000 tons of stocks represented about five months&apos; supplies for the city of berlin.     I accordingly approached the United States Secretaryof State and secured his agreement to the continuance of theairlift on a sufficient scale to ensure stock piling of 1,100,000tons of supplies in Berlin before 1st November.      It was estimated at the time that an airlift of about 50 per cent ofthe maximum capacity would be sufficient to attain our ends,but after further discussion it was felt that it would be more practical and more economical in the long run to take advantageof the fine summer weather to maintain a maximum airlift and soto bring stocks up to the required level before the target dateof 1st November,      In accordance with this policy the airlifthas been importing about 8,000 tons a day into Berlin during thelast month, and stocks have already risen to approximately600,000 tons.2. In these circumstances the British and United states military Governors have reviewed the situation, and I annexthree telegrams from General Robertson, in which he estimates that the target stock pile will be built up within approximately35 days, and recommends that immediate orders should be givenfor the reduction of the airlift by phases, and the re-deployment of the air forces on a proportionate basis.      He also recommends,that two Troop Carrier Groups of the United States Air Force,and two Heavy Transport Squadrons of the R. A.F. , should remainin Germany, and that the United Kingdom and United states government should take steps to ensure that the airlift can be built up again so as to attain the full scale within a periodof 90 days.      To this end each Air Force in Germany should ensure that installations within its control are maintainedsufficiently to ensure that the airlift can be built up againwithin this period.COPY NO.

Recommendation.3* I recommend that General Robertson should be informedthat his proposals are approved.The Considerations.k* As General Robertson points out, there is a limit to the amount which can physically or economically be stockedin Berlin.      I regard a five months&apos; stock asisatisfactoryfor our purposes, on the assumption that stocks are well-balanced.     The existence of such stocks in Berlin will notonly tend to discourage the Russians from interfering withour communications,, but it will give the inhabitants of Berlina sense of security and will enable us to prepare in good timefor the resumption of the airlift in the unlikely event of thereimposition of the blockade.     On the other hand, the con-tinuance^ of the airlift for a day longer than is necessarycould not be justified.     Not only does it impose a serious financial and economic burden on this country and tie up alarge proportion of our carrying capacity, but also it increasesconsiderably the financial and economic difficulties of theGerman administrations both in Berlin and the Western zones,particularly as regards requisitioning of services, billets,etc.      There is therefore a strong case for reducing the scale of the airlift as speedily as possible, provided always thatan adequate margin is left to cover our basic security require-ments and to ensure that the successful stand which we have,thanks to the airlift, been able to make in Berlin is notimperilled.5. It will be seen from the calculations set out inGeneral Robertson*s telegrams that we shall have during september and October a reserve carrying capacity, both by rail and barge and, if necessary, in the air, which should suffice to cover any additional requirements which may arise.No allowance has been made for the carriage of raw materials for industry nor for miscellaneous consumer goods which are largely brought in by road.      Road transport does, however,furnish an additional reserve capacity in case of need, but ithas been excluded from the present calculations.      The twoMilitary Governors intend to observe the position carefullyfrom week to week in order to make any necessary adjustmentsif deliveries fail to come up to expectations.      They will alsodecide how best to employ any reserve carrying capacity whichmay become available.6. Although I should hope that the arrangements for building up and maintaining the stock-pile in Berlin, whichhave been recommended by the British and United States military governors, would be sufficient to deter the Russians from,attempting to re-impose the blockade, we must clearly take steps to see that there is an adequate organisation left onthe ground in Germany to enable the airlift to be built up again swiftly if the need should arise.      To this end the twoMilitary Governors have in particular recommended that twoTroop Carrier Groups of the United States Air Force and twoheavy Transport squadrons of the R. A, P.  should remain inGermany.      I strongly support this recommendation, which appears to be a modest and reasonable insurance against furthertrouble.      From the general political point of view I attach great importance to the retention by the United States Govern-ment of some of their heavy aircraft in Germany.      This canonly be ensured if we play our part.      If, therefore, theUnited States Government are prepared to keep two CarrierGroups, I strongly recommend that we should contribute twoTransport squadrons.

767. If the recommendations made by General Robertsonare approved there will be a number of consequential matters which will require to be settled, such as the respectiverates of reduction between R. A.P. machines and civilianaircraft.      I recommend to my colleagues that these matters should be left to be settled by the existing inter-Departmental machinery.E.

annex.     Telegram from Berlin (Military Governor) to ForeignOffice. No.  1011, dated 1kth July, 19U9.      &apos;In accordance with instructions received from their governments the United States and United Kingdom military governors with their Air Force Commanders discussed today thefuture of the Berlin airlift.2. In their instructions the Military Governors havebeen told to plan for a stock pile in Berlin of ii- to 5 monthsestimated at 1,100,000 metric tons.     The question as towhether this figure of 1,100,000 metric tons actually representsU to 5 months1 stock depends upon the bases of calculationassumed for consumption of various commodities.     For examplean important difference would be introduced by varying thequantity of domestic fuel to be allowed during the winter.However the Military Governors are agreed that a figure of the magnitude of 1,100,000 metric tons can be-regarded as themaximum that is practicable from the point of view of storage and finance,3. Stocks in Berlin today are approximately 600,000metric tons.      The intake by all means of transport except roadis approximately 19,000 tons.     Consumption is 5,000 tons.Therefore there is a daily gain of approximately 1k,000 tons.At this rate the target stock pile will be built up withinapproximately 35 days,h* The Military Governors therefore consider that immediate steps to reduce the airlift by phases are necessary.According to the advice given them by their Air ForceCommanders the fastest practicable rate of phase-out would havethe effect of reducing the available airlift to 5*000 metric tons for one month, 3,000 metric tons during the second month and 1,800 metric tons thereafter.     This shows the need for an urgent decision for re-deployment of the air forces.5. The Military Governors therefore recommend that ordersfor re-deployment should be given forthwith in accordance withthe maximum practicable rate as proposed by the Air ForceCommanders given in paragraph k above.     They calculate that ifthese orders become effective from 1st August the target stockpile will have been achieved by 31st August and it will be unnecessary to make use of the airlift during the second phase of re-deployment.      However they undertake to observe theposition carefully from week to week in order to make anyadjustments that may be necessary due to the forecast of deliveries not coming up to expectation.6. In the above calculations no allowance has been madefor the carriage of raw materials for industry nor for consumer goods.      On the other hand no credit has been taken for road transport and it is by this means that most of these commodities are reaching Berlin at the moment.      Nor has any credit beentaken for supplies being received direct into Berlin from theEastern Zone.      Moreover the figure assumed for tonnage by railexcludes two rail paths which are being used for express freighttrains for non-stock-piles items.7* The Military Governors recommend that re-deploymentshould affect the United States Air Force and the R.A. F.proportionately, details to be worked out between the AirForce Commanders.

8. When the stock pile has been completed there wi?:$still be a surplus of intake capacity by rail and barge overrequirements of some 6,000 tons daily..    The utilisation ofthis surplus will depend primarily upon the possibilities offinance.     Towards the end of the year the surplus will be greatly reduced through increased winter consumption andcessation of barge traffic due to freezing of canals.9, With regard to the question of the possible resumptionof the airlift in the event of the reimposition of the blockadethe Military Governors have the following recommendations tomake:(A)   That two troop carrier groups U.S.A.P.  and two heavytransport squadrons R. A. F. remain in Germany.(b)   That their Governments make appropriate arrangements to ensure that the airlift can be built up again so as to attain full scale within a period of 90 days.(0)   That each Air Force in Germany shall ensure thatinstallations within its control are maintained sufficiently to ensure that the airlift can be built up again at the rategiven in (B) above.10. The Military Governors ask-.for a very early decisionof the above recommendations.     They are also of the opinionthat when approval has been received they should make a joint statement to the press of their intentions regarding the futureof the airlift without going into much detail.2,     Telegram from Berlin (Military Governor) to ForeignOffice. No.  1012, dated 14th July. 1949.My telegram No.  1011 is an agreed telegram withGeneral Hays who is despatching an identical telegram to hisGovernment.2. There is some argument between our staffs about thefigures in paragraph 3 particularly as regards the maximumquantity of coal that can be received and handled in Berlin.This argument does not affect the conclusion of the telegramviz. that the air forces should now be re-deployed at thefastest practicable rate.3&quot; We will watch the stock position carefully and haveplenty of margin for safety in the fact that there will be anavailable air-lift during the second phases of re-deployment of 3,000 tons per day which we are not expecting to require.4. Liquid fuel stocks are already adequate to coverrequirements to March, 1950. Allied requirements are cateredfor separately.3.     Telegram from Berlin (Military Governor) to ForeignOffice. Ho.  1014. dated 1Uth July. 1949.My telegram 1011.      United States/United kingdom military Governors&apos; recommendations on the future of the airlift.2. If the reductions in lift recommended in that signalare accepted, a progressive reduction in numbers of British air-craft will be possible.     Air Officer Commander-in-Chief is in communication with the Air Ministry on this point, with particular!reference as to which types of aircraft should be released.      Itis requested that you will discuss the question of release ofcivil dry freighters with Air Ministry, as it is understood theymay wish for the early release of certain R.A.F. machines.-5-
