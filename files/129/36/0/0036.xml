(49) 185, I circulate, for theinformation of my colleagues, a note, prepared in the Treasury, estimating thevalue of the various short-term measures which the United Kingdom representa-tives at the forthcoming Washington discussions will press on the United Statesand Canada. Any attempt to quantify the benefits which we might hope toreceive as a result of these measures is extremely speculative, and it would bevery dangerous to give currency to any figure arrived at by adding up all the.separate items set out.R.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited, it is issued for the personal use of ........ .....................................................TOP SECRET CdpyNo.22WASHINGTON DISCUSSIONSEstimates of the Relief the United Kingdom might get (in the year ending30th June, 1950) from the Various &quot; Short-Term Measures &quot; to be Discussed1. E.R.P. Administration Greater FlexibilityThis covers two sets of questions : (a) the eligibility of certain commodities services for E.R.P. finance; and (b) documentation difficulties.The importance of these figures is that the refusal of the United states authorities to regard certain commodities and services as eligible for E.C.A.(Economic Co-operation Administration) financing, or their insistence on docu-mentation conditions with which we cannot comply, means that we have to pay for them out of our free dollars. This means that these costs are literally a loss toour reserves, for our earnings of dollars are barely enough to cover our dollar expenditure other than on imports into the United Kingdom. If these commodities services can be transferred to E.C.A. financing, this immediately eases the pressure on our reserves, for it reduces our free dollar expenditure forthwith.Greater flexibility in E.R.P. administration does not provide us with any additional dollars. But it prevents loss in our reserves, by enabling us to use our E.R.P. aid in order to buy the things we really need instead of having to usesome of it for the purchase of less-essential goods which we cannot really afford.In short, it enables us to cut our coat according to our cloth.(a) Eligibility questions. The main items are : *Canadian wheat and flour*Canadian cheese*Canadian bacon* Canadian eggs*Canadian pulp and paper*Canadian timber*Canadian tobacco$ million(1949-50)30915131710238395Miscellaneous manufactures      ...      ...      ...      ...       21Oil   ...      ...............      ...      ...        12* These are all existing commitments.In addition there are : 428$ millionCertain dollar freights (mainly on tankers employedby British oil companies)   ...      ...      ....      ... ? 10Proportion of ships&apos; dollar disbursements     ...      ..&apos;. 30Oil equipment      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...... 7537521
On the main item, Canadian wheat, eligibility depends on whether the UnitedStates Department of Agriculture determines United States wheat to be in surplussupply,, and the Department will not consider this until after the 1st Septembercrop returns. It is impossible to forecast how the decision will go, but the favour-able August crop report is discouraging to our case. Even if the decision were favourable for the future it is very doubtful whether it would apply retrospectivelyto expenditure in the third quarter of 1949, which accounts for $84 million outof the year&apos;s total of $309 million. At the most, therefore, we are not likely toget relief of more than about $220 million.There is little or no hope of relief on Canadian cheese, bacon, eggs ortobacco. Prospects are better for pulp and paper and timber and possibly forthe ineligible oil imports ($45 million together) and we might get, say, half ($10million) of the miscellaneous manufactures.On the second group of items we might perhaps get the freights ($10 million)and, say, half the oil equipment ($37 million).Excluding wheat, the totals suggested above come to about $100 million.(b) Documentation. Imports amounting to $68 million come to a largenumber of small, private importers and complexities of documentation havehitherto been held to make it necessary to omit them from E.R.P. financing.By simplifying the system we might get relief on perhaps $25 million.2. Resumption and Intensification of United States StockpilingOn certain assumptions about the amount of the United States appropriationand the sterling area share of the materials to be bought, the Board of Tradeestimate, with all possible reserve, that purchases which benefit us might beanything between $50-$150 million in a full year say, $100 million.(Canada is also to be asked to increase her stockpiling. The possible benefit,however, is not thought likely to exceed, say, $15 million, so the round figureof $100 million above is taken to cover Canada as well as the United States.)3. Revision of United States Policy on Drawings from the International MonetaryFundThe countries with the main drawing rights are the United Kingdom,Australia and India. The rule is that 25 per cent, of the quota may be drawn inany period of twelve months, at a rate not exceeding 5 per cent, of the quota ineach month. Assuming that each country could draw up to its full entitlement,the amounts available to be drawn are as follows : United Kingdom. -$325 million in the twelve months following the first newdrawing.Apart from anything else, the United Kingdom is at present pre-vented from drawing because it enjoys E.R.P. Aid. Assuming that this and other difficulties were removed, the United Kingdom might draw$325 million before 30th June, 1950.Australia. $50 million in the twelve months following the first newdrawing.Australia intends to draw, when possible, as an alternative, in part,to reducing her dollar imports. Her 25 per cent, reduction of dollar&apos;imports amounts to about $50 million, but unofficially we understandthat the cut will probably be only about $30 million. Assuming that australia drew the full $50 million and that $20 million was in replace-ment of part of import cuts due, the net benefit to the central reservesover and above that already assumed from import cuts would be$30 million.India. $100 million in the twelve months following the first drawing.For present purposes it is assumed that India draws the full$100 million.4. More Liberal Use of the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopmentNo credit to the reserves is taken for this item, because there is a strongprobability that we shall have to allow any borrowing Commonwealth countryto spend its borrowings on capital items over and above its reduced import programmes.
5. More Liberal Administration of the United States TariffIt is impossible to say how far any arguments we put forward on this willmeet with opposition from &quot; pressure groups &quot; in the United States, or, if we are successful, now soon our exporters will take advantage of relaxations. TheBoard of Trade suggest, with every reserve, that the benefit in a full year mightbe between 5 and 10 per cent, of our export trade, i.e., between flO and $20million, say $15 million.6. Reduction of Proportion of Synthetic Rubber to Natural RubberThe Board of Trade have approached this as follows, all the figures being fora full year. The minimum Use of synthetic rubber required by the statute is225,000 tons per annum. To this a departmental order added 50,000 tons. Overand above that 275,000 tons, consumers voluntarily used a further 166,000 tons,making the total 441,000 tons. It is assumed that the new statutory minimumneed be only the difference between the present statutory minimum (220,000 tons)and the voluntary consumption (166,000 tons), i.e. (generously written up) 75,000tons. Add the existing voluntary consumption and another 100,000 tons on general grounds, and the total consumption of synthetic rubber would be 341,000tons, a saving of 100,000 tons. Of this saving, to be replaced by natural rubber the amount of which is obviously very speculative indeed the sterling area might hope to gain 70 per cent., worth $25 million.7. Loans from the Export-Import BankNo credit is taken for this item in view of the absence of any information about possible applications and about length of time which cases take to come tofruition.Treasury, 2Ast August, 1949.
