THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1949SECRET Copy No. 31CP. (39) 1S3l&amp;th July, 1949CABINETCHANNEL tunnel memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of LancasterOn 5th May, 1949 (CM. (49) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 3), the cabinet agreed that the Government should define their present attitude on the ChannelTunnel question, in case the matter should be raised by European Governments,either in the&apos;Council of Europe or otherwise; and the intention, then was thata Committee should be appointed for this purpose. Subsequently, the PrimeMinister decided that it was not necessary to appoint a formal Committee, andthat it would be sufficient for the interested Departments to put their views inwriting.  He asked me to arrange this, and the following is my report.. I invited those Ministers who, departmentally, are most closely concernedwith this question, to give me their views in the light of present conditions,military, political and economic. All these conditions have changed considerablysince 1930, when the proposal for a Channel Tunnel Vas last carefully studied.My colleagues, whom I have consulted, are unanimous against the early construc-tion of a Tunnel, and their general opinion is against it, even as a long-termproject. In addition to the summary of their views; which is contained inparagraphs 3-6 of this paper, I attach as appendices (1) An appreciation by the Chiefs of Staff (Appendix A).(2) A memorandum by the Foreign Office (Appendix B).(3) A memorandum by the Board of Trade (Appendix C).(4) A memorandum by the Minister of Transport (Appendix D).2. Historical. A proposal for the construction of a Tunnel under theChannel was first made by a French mining engineer named Mathieu. Thisproposal was made in 1802, a year when we had a few months&apos; respite in our longwar with France lasting from 1792 to 1815. Mathieu&apos;s proposal was made toNapoleon, and was supported by Charles James Fox. Since that time there havebeen many studies and discussions on this subject, including five inquiries bythe British Government in the present century, in 1906-07, in 1914, in 1919-20,in 1924 and in 1929-30. On this last occasion economic opinion was divided,but Service opinion was, as it has consistently been, against the construction ofthe Tunnel. In the House of Commons on 30th June, 1930, a Private Member&apos;motion in support of the Tunnel was defeated, on a free vote, by 179 votes to172.Among past Prime Ministers and other leading political figures who haveexpressed an opinion on this subject from.time to time, there has been a very heavy majority against the Tunnel, its chief supporter having been Mr. Churchill.The history of past discussions is summarised in Committee of ImperialDefence Paper No. 164-A of January 1929, and reference may also be made toC.I.D. Paper No. 174-A of May 1930, to the Report of the Channel TunnelPolicy Committee of the Economic Advisory Council of March 1930, and tothe Report of the Channel Tunnel Committee (Cmd. 3513) of March 1930.3. Defence Arguments. In their new appreciation the Chiefs of Staff pointout that in 1930 the conclusion of their predecessors was that no important
military advantage would be found in the construction of the Tunnel and that,indeed, it would involve a heavy new military commitment without any corre-sponding advantage. The main military changes since 1930 which have a bearing on the matter are the development of weapons of mass destruction, advances, in mining and submarine warfare, airborne forces, increased weight of modern: h equipment and fifth column activity.Some of these developments strengthen the case for the Tunnel. It would,for example, provide an additional means of reinforcing armies on the Continent,and for sending heavy military equipment by a route not subject to attack bymines or submarines. But, after taking into account the vulnerability of theTunnel to air attack, and the problems involved in defending the exits and making arrangements for the Tunnel to be put out of action at snort notice, the Chiefsof Staff now conclude &quot; that the military advantages are outweighed by themilitary disadvantages. However, the military considerations are of minor importance relative to any strong political and economic arguments for or againstthe project, always provided adequate means of putting the Tunnel out of actionare incorporated in its construction.&quot;4. Political Arguments-The Foreign Secretary.&apos;s view is that, &quot;while there is no political objection to the scheme, the matter is purely academic, since in present circumstances, when there are so many other projects involving capitalexpenditure which must have a prior claim both from the political and from other points of view, we could not possibly justify the dissipation of our limited resources on a.scheme of this nature.&quot; A detailed examination is made in aForeign Office memorandum which concludes that, although important short-termpolitical advantages would flow from the construction of the Tunnel, there arealso strong long-term objections, largely arising from the uncertainty of Frenchpolitical developments.5. Economic Argtiments. The view of the Chancellor of the exchequer is that over a period of years the necessary money (possibly about  90 million)and other resources for the Tunnel could be made available as part of ourcapital investment programme. It would, however, be necessary to squeeze outother large projects and &quot; it would not be sensible to devote so large an amountout of our resources to this project unless it was thought to have substantialadvantages, economic, political and strategic.&quot; The Chancellor also thinks that developments since 1930, including the growth of air travel and the introductionof the train ferry, together with the experience of the last war, may well besaid to have diminished the attractions of the Tunnel rather than increased them.The President of the Board of Trade considers that the commercial successof the Tunnel must depend upon (a) a reduction in the cost of cross-Channeltransit compared with existing services and (6) the development of new traffic.It appears that comparatively little would be saved by the abandonment ofexisting services (e.g., ships, ports, rolling stock, &amp;c). Against this must be set the cost of upkeep of the Tunnel and the high capital charges that would be incurred. The economic case must, therefore, rest largely on the additionaltraffic that would be developed by the Tunnel. As regards passenger traffic, theprospects of a large increase are very speculative, and it would be hard to justifyheavy capital expenditure to meet so uncertain a demand. Increased traffic ingoods would probably consist mainly of imports of perishable agricultural produce and luxury goods, and it is most unlikely, on balance of payments grounds, thatthis could be allowed to go very far. The direct stimulus to British exports wouldprobably be very limited.The Minister of Transport considers that a through route between thiscountry and the Continent might have great psychological value for european unity, but doubts whether the Tunnel would be more effective, from this point ofview, than an improvement in the existing cross-Channel services. These services are maintained by a fleet.of specially constructed vessels and are capable of greatdevelopment, particularly the train ferry. If the Tunnel were built, these services would wither away. The Tunnel would tend to monopolise. the cross-Channeltraffic and we should, therefore, be relying on one highly vulnerable means ofcommunication, instead of having our communications spread over a large numberof ports and routes. The maintenance of the present shipping routes, and par-ticularly the improvement of the train ferry service, is the right transport policy
for us to pursue. It is doubtful whether the Tunnel would be a greater attractionto tourists than improved sea services, since it would not do away with customs and other formalities.The Minister of Civil Aviation does not think that the Tunnel would necessarily be detrimental to the expansion of air traffic. Some air traffic,particularly to Paris, might be diverted to the Tunnel, but this would not seriously affect the demand for more speedy transit than can be provided, by surface routes.If, however, it were proposed to construct the Tunnel while there are still severelimitations on the national investment programme, the Minister would prefer tosee money and resources devoted to the construction of civil aerodromes and otheraviation purposes.6. Summary. The general view of Ministers is, therefore, unanimouslyagainst the construction of a Tunnel at an early date or, indeed, so long as wehave seriously to restrict our investment plans. And that is likely to be along time.In addition to the military objections, there are strong economic objectionsto providing the necessary resources in men, materials and money for thisparticular project in preference to many others which would be of greater nationaladvantage. And this applies even in the field of competing transport projects.Improved civil aviation and train ferries are much better, and quicker, value for money than a Channel Tunnel. If it were proposed, as part of a programme for improving European transport, that other nations should find part of theresources required to improve communications between this island and theContinent, it would still be true that a Channel Tunnel would be a second-bestinvestment of these resources. And it seems likely that the technical inferiorityof the Tunnel to other means of cross-Channel transport will become more andmore marked in the future.7. I, therefore, recommend that the Cabinet should record a decision againstthe construction of a Tunnel. It is for consideration whether any public statement to this effect should be made, either in the House of Commons or, if the questionis raised at Strasbourg, in the Council of Europe.H.

APPENDIX A[C.O.S. (49) 21821st June, 1949.]CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEECHANNEL TUNNELAppreciation by the Chiefs of StaffIn this paper we review, in the light of modern developments, the military-implications of a Tunnel under the English Channel.Existing proposals. We assume that the present proposals for the construction of a Tunnelinvolve no substantial departure from plans put forward by the Channel TunnelCompany in 1930. These contemplated the construction of a tunnel 36 mileslong, of which 24 miles would be under the Straits of Dover. The Englishmouth of the tunnel would be about one mile west of Folkestone and the Frenchmouth some ten miles south of Calais. There would be two independent traffictunnels, of 18 feet 6 inch diameter, each containing a single line of electric railway.There would also be a pilot tunnel of 10 feet diameter for drainage and ventilation.It was estimated in 1930 that the whole project would be completed in ^ to 7 years.3. The tunnel, if started now, is not likely to be completed before 1957 andwould, therefore, have no bearing on our short-term strategy. Once finished, how-ever, it would remain one of the principal peacetime means of communication withth6 Continent in the forseeable future. Any strategic review of the project must therefore take account of the possibility of a radical change in our present relation-ship with the French Government.Historical4. Since 1882 the proposal to build a Channel Tunnel has periodicallyengaged the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government. On each occasion it has been rejected because, quite apart from political and economic considerations, it hasbeen deemed militarily undesirable. The principal military argument has beenthe fear that the tunnel would provide a means of invading this country.5.   Early views were exemplified by Lord Wolseley in 1882 when he wrote : &quot; The danger is briefly this, that the French, or whoever for the timebeing held the Calais end of the Tunnel, could by a coup de main seize ourend of it, and the very moment they had done so Dover would become a tetedu font for their army, from which they could issue forth with any large army they chose to bring through the Tunnel. In other words, from that moment we should cease to be an independent Power, as we have no army inEngland, nor could we raise any army that would have the slightest possible.chance, under any circumstances whatever, short of the direct interpositionof God Almighty, of enabling us to withstand a French Army of thecharacter that could be poured into (this country.&quot;6. Although military opinion subsequently modified this extreme view ofthe potential danger to the country&apos;s security, the objection was still consideredvalid enough in 1924 to prohibit the scheme on the grounds that &quot; the existenceof a Tunnel (particularly in the event of an international crisis) might lead toa public demand for measures, whether of naval, military or air defences, whichwould tend to concentrate an undue proportion of our limited defensive resources in the region of the Tunnel to the detriment of the general defence of the country.&quot;
Views of the Chiefs of Staff in 19307. The last occasion on which proposals for a Channel Tunnel were re-viewed by His Majesty&apos;s Government was in 1930. The views then given by theChiefs of Staff (C.I.D. Paper No. 176-A) can be summarised as follows :-(a) LogisticOwing to the increased impediments of military formations (comparedwith 1914) the Tunnel would be unlikely to offer any advantage as com-gared with sea transport for the move of an Expeditionary Force to theontinent, even from the point of view of time.(b) StrategicThere would be grave disadvantages in the Army being dependent forits main line of communications on a submarine tunnel, since this might. have an adverse influence on strategy in an Allied withdrawal; either theBritish Army would become separated from its Ally in order to fall backon the Tunnel, or, falling back in conformity with its Ally, it would becomeseparated from its base. Any Commander-in-Chief would, therefore, prefer to be dependent, as in the past, on the adaptable and well-tested system of sea communications.(c) Cross Channel services the existence of the Tunnel would mean a reduction in Cross Channelsteamer services, involving the disappearance of some steamers and the siltingup and deterioration of the ports of Newhaven and Folkestone. On the out-break of war we should wish to use these ports and steamers for military purposes.(d) Risk of CaptureAn enemy might be prepared to take very considerable risks in an attemptto capture the Tunnel by a coup de main. Adequate provision would, there-fore, have to be made both to protect it and to put it out of action ifnecessary. The defence of the northern end of it would become a military commitment of the first importance, for which additional regular forces would need to be retained in the United Kingdom in peace. This might bea serious embarrassment in an emergency; it would also add considerably tothe annual maintenance cost of the Tunnel.8.   The Chiefs of Staff therefore concluded that (a) no important military advantage was to be found in the construction ofthe Tunnel;(b) from the point of view of Imperial defence it would involve a heavymilitary commitment without any corresponding advantage.Military Developments since 19309. The main military developments since 1930 which have a bearing on this problem are: (a) The power of weapons of mass destruction and the enhanced ability to deliver explosives by means of rockets and aircraft;(b) advances in mining and submarine warfare;(c) airborne forces;(d) the increased weight of modern Army equipment and the increasedlogistic support required for land and air forces.(e) fifth column activity.We examine below the views of the Chiefs of Staff in 1930 in the light ofthe above developments.Strategic10. In modern war, particularly if weapons of mass destruction are used,the need for dispersion will be of even greater importance. The Tunnel could,therefore, only be considered as one of several lines of communication to theContinent and not necessarily the main line.   It would, however, be a most
valuable alternative to shipping, since current developments in mining and sub-marine warfare constitute a greatly increased threat to sea communications.Logistic11. Modern Armies and Air Forces require considerably more logistic support, particularly as regards oil fuels. The petrol Pipe Line laid under theChannel during the last war was operated successfully but its capacity was limited.If the Channel Tunnel is built there would appear to be no technical difficulty inconstructing a Pipe Line to go through the Pilot Tunnel or in one of the maintraffic tunnels.. Such a Pipe Line would ease the problem on petrol and oil supply, although,as in the case with administrative support as a whole, alternative plans wouldhave to be made in case the Tunnel should be destroyed. Furthermore, the weightand size of modern equipment, particularly tanks, heavy artillery and radarapparatus, make loading in. the normal cargo ships difficult and there- are very fewspecially fitted ships available. The proposed tunnel would be able to handleexpeditiously much of this equipment, although it is unlikely to be able to takethe largest items.So long, therefore, as the Channel Tunnel and its rail connections at eitherend can be kept in working order, it would form a most valuable line of cpmmunica-tion, although it could never meet our full requirements. It would be particularlyvaluable for rapid movement of personnel and heavy equipment and would beunaffected by mining and submarine warfare.Cross Channel Services12. The existence of the Tunnel would reduce the use of ports on both sides of the Channel for passenger and freight traffic. This, in turn, would lead todeterioration of the ports and disappearance of Cross Channel steamers.Although the ports of Dover, Folkestone and Newhaven are not indispensablemilitarily for the support of forces on the Continent, the Belgian and FrenchCross Channel ports will almost certainly be required. Moreover the loss of the cross Channel steamers would be serious.Liability to Capture13. The use of airborne forces and the developments of fifth columntechniques has increased the danger of the ends of the Tunnel being captured by surprise. Adequate arrangements will therefore be required both in peace andin war for the protection of the Tunnel and, if necessary, to put it out of action.As regards the defence of the Tunnel exits, this should not involve a largecommitment in peace, although we are placed at some disadvantage in that wecannot be responsible for the protection of the French exits.    &apos;Scientific developments should enable us to put the Tunnel itself out of action should we so desire, although this will add to the cost of construction. The decisionto do this, which must be made on a Government level having regard to all the factors, might be a difficult one to make in certain circumstances and, therefore,there is the danger that such a decision might be left until too late.DeductionsAdvantages14.   The Tunnel would have the following military advantages: (a) it would provide an additional means of communication to the Continentwith the valuable asset that it would not be subject to the dangers of submarines or mines;(6) it would offer the most convenient means of transporting certain heavymilitary equipment to the Continent;(c) it would increase the speed with which available reinforcements could besent to the Continent.Disadvantages15.   It would have the following military disadvantages: (a) the Tunnel would be only slightly less vulnerable to air attack than otherCross  Channel  Lines of  Communication.   It  is,  however,  more
. . vulnerable to sabotage. It cab, therefore, only be considered as one. ;;: .       of several Lines of Communication;(b) it would entail a small additionaldefenee commitment in peace;(c) there is a danger that a hostile Power might capture it intact.   the likelihood of this would be considerably increased if France were tocome under Communist influence;(d) the Tunnel would, in peace, take.much of the traffic now handled by the- Cross Channel ports. This would result in deterioration of the ports and a reduction in the number of Cross Channel steamers available.These ports and steamers are required in war.(e) the decision to put the Tunnel out of action might be a difficult one tomake in certain circumstances.Conclusions16. We conclude that the military advantages are outweighed by the militarydisadvantages. However, the military considerations are of minor importancerelative to any strong political or economic arguments for or against the project,always provided adequate means of putting the Tunnel out of action areincorporated in its construction.(Signed) TEDDER,FRASER,W. J. SLIM.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,21st June, 1949.APPENDIX BMemorandum by the Foreign office. This is the first time since 1929 that the Government has undertakenan enquiry into the merits of a Channel Tunnel. It is also the first time since1924 that the Foreign Office has been called upon to formulate a view. Thedepartment has accordingly attempted in this memorandum to review all the argu-ments both old and new and to assess their cogency on a strictly objective basis.The problem is one of vast implication, which merits full consideration from afresh start.2. The memorandum deals mainly with the political aspects of the problem;short passages have, however, been included on the economic and strategic aspects,since, although these are the primary responsibility of other departments, theynevertheless have a certain Foreign Office interest and must also influence con-sideration of the problem as a whole. It is, in fact, probable that the Govern-menfs attitude to the scheme will be decided on economic and strategic and noton political grounds.Historical Background3. The idea of a submarine tunnel connecting England with the continentis about 150 years old. It was first thought of, we are told, by an ingeniousFrenchman in the year 1800 as a means by which his master Napoleon couldinvade this island. More respectable motives inspired later studies of the idea,and in 1865 Sir John Hawkshaw undertook geological surveys of the english and French coasts. Further surveys were made in 1875 by the newly-formedFrench Tunnel Company. In 1881 experimental shafts were sunk near Doverby the South Eastern Railway Company. Military fears and opposition were then aroused and have ever since that time held back the project.4. Attempts to revive the scheme in Parliament were regularly defeateduntil the year 1929, when Mr. Baldwin was obliged to set up an Economic Com-mittee of Enquiry. In 1930 this committee published its report which, briefly,held the scheme to be physically feasible and economically justifiable; Mr. ramsay macdonald&apos;s Government, however, rejected it on physical, economic and military
grounds. In the subsequent debate in the House the Government only secured the defeat of the scheme by the narrow majority of seven votes. In the house to-day 200 Members have put their names under the motion.Past Foreign Office Views5. Our archives show that opinion in the Foreign Office, both official and ministerial, has always been heavily against the tunnel.The Political A rguments in Favour6. The construction of a tunnel under the Channel promises certain political advantages which are both substantial in themselves and easily perceptible tothe public at large.   They can be summarised as follows : (a) The Effect on our European A HiesMany of our European allies in Western Union and the Atlantic Pactare still unconvinced that we have really abandoned our traditional policyof retaining our freedom of action by avoiding entagling continentalalliances. It would go far to convince our sceptical allies if the BritishGovernment should now, after firmly opposing the construction of a Channeltunnel for over seventy years, give support to the project, which would bea symbol of the new relationship which we are trying to set up among thecountries of Europe in other words, the &quot; Spirit of Western Union.&quot; Ifwe can give the lead, we shall be taking a really big, imaginative and con-structive step towards the recovery and integration of Western Europe.There is reason to believe that the French, who, of course, have nothing to lose politically or strategically, would welcome the project.(b) The Effect on the U.S.S.R.. The project should discourage Soviet hopes of driving a wedge betweenthe nations of Western Europe. It should also impress the Kremlin with theinitiative, co-operation, wealth and mechanical skill of the Western Powers.,(c) The Effect on the United states the tunnel should appeal to those elements of governmental and publicopinion in the United States which desire to see material evidence of closer -operation and self-help amongst the countries of Europe. Generallyspeaking, it is the kind of project to strike the American imagination, both because of its technical nature and because of its appeal to the sentimentsof human brotherhood and neighbourliness.(d) The Effect on British Public opinion the project should help to bring home to public opinion in this country the importance and permanence of recent changes in British foreign policy.It should create a more real appreciation amongst English people of the factthat the security and prosperity of France and of Western Europe generally are essential to Britain&apos;s security and prosperity and that we are now inevery sense a part of Europe.(e) Freedom of MovementA Channel Tunnel would increase the freedom of movement and the speed and comfort of travel between the Continent and the United Kingdom,and should thus, by encouraging travel in each direction, be an instrument for greater understanding and sympathy between the nations. Cultural,social, sporting and political contacts should be amplified by it.(/) The Council of europe the project would be a most suitable practical subject for discussion bythe Council of Europe when it is set up and would give it just the sort offillip which it will need to establish itself as an organisation capable ofdealing with large-scale practical European problems.The Political Arguments Against7. Against these attractions of the project must be set the objections whichhave been advanced against it for the past half century and which may he held,to a greater of lesser degree, to be valid to-day.
(a) Commitment to the French AllianceThe existence of a Tunnel would tend to commit us to one nation France and to destroy or at least diminish that freedom of action which we have always striven to maintain. It is too early to be confident that our traditionalpolicy of detachment may in no circumsances have to be revised. And noone can answer for the long-term friendship or political stability of France.Apart from the general danger of Communism there is always the risk of specific rifts in Anglo-French amity, such as the Fashoda incident or the ruhr crisis.(b) Danger in War-TimeSupporters of the Tunnel scheme used in the past to argue that we couldrely on international instruments, such as the Covenant of the League ofNations, the Kellog Peace Pact or the Locarno Treaty, to ensure peace. Theresults of that reliance were disappointing. To-day our strategy is based onthe slender assurance of the United Nations and on alliances which includeFrance. We hope that these alliances will remain intact; but we cannot be certain. It is quite on the cards that France may fail to recover spiritually,economically, politically and militarily; and that she will succumb to Com-communism, The present grouping of Western Union would then lose its value to the other partners, who might seek to avert further disaster by form-ing other alliances. The Channel Tunnel might then prove to be a serious embarrassment and liability unless infallible security precautions could betaken : the potential efficacity of these precautions is a moot point. lord balfour observed on this subject: &quot; As long as the ocean remains our friend,do not let us deliberately destroy its power to help us.&quot;(c) The Basic change the existence of a Tunnel, with its undoubted military vulnerability,would tend to create a certain nervousness in this country, against which those few miles of salt water have always, perhaps illogically, protected us.Although the aeroplane has already done much to destroy the conception ofthe Channel as a &quot; moat defensive to a house,&quot; there is still an obvious signifi-cance, for the British people, in inhabiting an island having no land com-munication with its neighbours. An important element in the character ofour national life would be altered by the creation of a land connection.What the precise effect would be is difficult to judge, and the point needsmuch thought; but one effect might for example be the weakening of thatunquestioning sense of superiority over the peoples of the continent which forms an essential element in British self-confidence and which has proved its value in recent times. The preservation of our physical detachment isclosely allied to our consciousness of security. Anxiety to avoid the drasticstep of blowing up the tunnel might moreover inspire policies of expediencyand near collaborationism.(d) Do close contacts between peoples necessarily breed friendliness?It has been argued that in the long run closeness of contact betweenpeoples does not necessarily improve relations and may even do the opposite.History is full of illustrations. In face of the Communist menace it is, ofcourse, important for all Europeans to widen their knowledge of the range of the culture which they have to defend, and our policy is to destroy thebarriers which impede personal and social intercourse between the nations of the West. This old objection, however, cannot easily be dismissed, andat the least we must hold it doubtful that increased opportunities for travelreally contribute a positive advantage of great importance.(e) American ReactionsIt has been argued (in paragraph 6 (c) above), that the Tunnel wouldappeal to the Americans. Conversely, may it not move them to demandwhether it was for such ends as this that Marshall aid was given? Suchlong-term enterprises of unproven necessity, the more isolationist Americansmight argue, are a luxury that Europe cannot yet afford; and if she has so
much free capital available she had better use it for modernising her industry or re-equipping her armed forces.(/) Is the Tunnel necessary?An analogy has been drawn on commercial and social grounds betweenthe Channel Tunnel and the St. Gothard, and the argument has been advancedthat the building of the Tunnel is necessary to increase trade and othercontacts between Britain and the Continent. This analogy is basicallyfallacious. Tunnels provide the only satisfactory passages through the Alps,which are an otherwise insurmountable barrier. The English Channel onthe other hand, provides a broad highway for shipping, the most economicalof all forms of transport. Many critics will undoubtedly argue that thevast capital required could be far better employed on other, more immediatelyprofitable exercises.(g) Delayed EffectDuring the seven long years of its construction, the Tunnel might, more-over, lost much of its popularity. Money will pour down it, whilst no visibleprofit will emerge: loans will be floated and taxation perhaps increased:there may be accidents and interruptions. After four or five years the Tunnelmay come to be regarded as a white elephant.The most important political considerations in favour of the Tunnelare predicated on the immediate psychological effect. This effect, however,can only be of a token nature for at least the first seven years: by the endof that period many things may have changed.Summary of Political Arguments8. The Department is not attempting to strike a balance of the political considerations for and against the scheme. There are important short-termadvantages : there are strong long-term objections. The project is not the only means to the accomplishment of the ends envisaged and there may be other lesscosfly and less risky methods of furthering the same objects. Vital elements inour national life and character, deriving from the consciousness of living on an island, will inevitably be affected if a land connection with the Continent iscreated whether for better or for worse is a matter for conjecture.9. If a conclusion based solely on the immediate political advantages ofthe project had to be reached at this moment, it might be that the answer wouldbe favourable. But if, as seems probable, economic or strategic considerationsprevent a start from being made for some years to come, it may be better to defer final assessment of the political factors until the need for a decision becomesmore actual. The political balance sheet may look very different in a few years&apos;time. It would be embarrassing if, after giving its blessing to the scheme to-day,His Majesty&apos;s Government were forced to raise political objections at a later stage when the economic possibilities were more favourable. It might, accordingly,be wisest for the Foreign Office to maintain a non-committal attitude.Economic Considerations10. We are not called upon to put forward economic arguments, and this paper does not therefore go into such obvious points as the increase in the tourist traffic, but these arguments are bound to influence our views, and there may be certain politico-economic considerations to which we should draw the attentionof the economic Departments.11. Those Departments will doubtless be revising the estimates of cost andprofit which were drawn up in 1930, but meanwhile it may be useful to make someremarks based on the calculations then made and on recent figures supplied by theChannel Tunnel Parliamentary Study Group.12.   There were two outstanding features in the conclusions drawn in1930 :-(a) Until a pilot tunnel had been constructed it could not be said with cer-tainty that the project was practicable; there might in particular befissures or faults in the &quot; Lower Chalk &quot; stratum under the sea bed;
(b) although the Channel Tunnel Committee, appointed by the Governmentin 1929, believed that the project offered a net economic advantage, itwas unable to quote convincing evidence to that effect and the economicMinistries, who afterwards commented on the report, were sceptical.13. Engineering knowledge is presumably more advanced to-day, and itshould therefore be possible to gauge the technical chances of success with greateraccuracy and less expense than in 1930. Some of the economic arguments thenused may also be no longer ^applicable; others may need to be revised. Thebalance of long-term economic advantage may not be the same as it was in 1930.At that time the whole cost of the project was to be borne, in the first place, atleast, by private British interests; to-day we should be able to count on substantialcontributions from France and perhaps from other European countries. On theother hand it must be appreciated that the decision now required of the Govern-ment is a far more serious one than it was in 1930. Then it was only a questionof allowing private investors to risk their own money; to-day- the Government hasthe responsibility of deciding whether the British taxpayers&apos; money is to be usedfor the project a project to which, incidentally, many a British taxpayer may be most emphatically averse, particularly as at least seven years must elapse before he can hope to see any return on his money.14. According to the 1947 estimate of the Channel Tunnel Study Group,the pilot tunnel would take about five years to build and would cost about  12-Jmillion. The main tunnels would take a further three years and cost about 53 million. Other capital expenditure would be about  3 million. The annualnet profit would be somewhere between  300,000 and  1 million, after allowing for interest.15. These cost figures must certainly be revised upwards; a safe minimumfigure would probably be not less than  75 million. The cost is therefore highand the profit moderate, especially since the Study Group ignores possible losses(e.g., to British Railways) due tb disuse of other cross-channel facilities. Butif other countries can be persuaded to bear some of the risk the picture is changed.Yet another possibility is that the United States might make a special contributionwithin the European Recovery Programme without detriment to other allocations;this, however, seems highly improbable.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,10th June, 1949.APPENDIX CMemorandum by the Board oe trade.   introduction in 1872 the Board of Trade welcomed the idea of a link between the Britishand Continental railway systems, provided that the cost was met from privatefunds and that there was no monopoly. The Board did not suggest activeencouragement. Since then there have been five enquiries into the merits of the project-in 1906, 1914, 1920, 1924 and 1929-and on three occasions-in 1906,1914 and 1929 the Board of Trade has submitted a full memorandum on theeconomic aspects of a tunnel. On no occasion has the Board shown muchenthusiasm for the project and several times the conclusions reached have beenunfavourable. In 1914, for example, the Board agreed that a tunnel &quot; would probably have but little effect on the foreign trade of this country.Indeed, the question of passenger traffic is alone important, and by it theTunnel scheme as a commercial enterprise must stand or fall .... the route thus provided would afford only an expensive mode of travel,and . . . the saving of time involved would be small.&quot;The Board added that &quot;financially there is serious reason to doubt whether the scheme would be successful.&quot;
In 1920 the President of the Board of Trade (Sir Auckland Geddes) took theview that it was unnecessary to review the economic considerations bearing&quot; on theproposals for a tunnel, since &apos;&apos; the encouragement of such an undertaking duringthe financial stringency which must continue for some years to come would be entirely unjustifiable.&quot; Four years later/the then President (Mr. Sidney Webb)said that he did not think that there were &quot;any new reasons which I should urge, in the interests of the country&apos;strade, why obstacles to the construction of the Tunnel should be over-ridden.&quot;When the project was last reviewed, in 1929, the Board of Trade did notsubmit a separate memorandum, and the joint memorandum to which they con-tributed made no specific recommendation. The general outcome of /the estimates in the memorandum was that the main source of revenue would be from passenger traffic and that the gross return on. the capital cost (before allowing anything forcosts of operation, upkeep and depreciation) would be unlikely ito exceed 6 percent.2.   Economic Aspects(A) The commercial success of a Channel Tunnel must rest upon: (a) A reduction in the cost of providing existing services.(6) The development of new traffic.-  (a) Reduction in Cost of Existing services the less existing services cost, the less the saving from discontinuingthem, the weaker is the case for a tunnel. There is no sense in spending afortune to save a bagatelle. So far as can be judged, comparatively littlewould be saved by the abandonment of existing services (such as ships, ports,rolling stock, &amp;c.) displaced by the construction of the Tunnel. Nothing atall would be saved on account of the fixed installations (e.g., at ports) for&quot;which no other use could be found. The total shipping involved is not morethan about 8,000 net tons. More, not less, rolling stock would be required.Against this must be set the costs of upkeep of the Tunnel and the high&quot;capital charges that would require to be incurred because of the constructionof about 35 miles of tunnel and marshalling sidings, interchange stations, &amp;c,at each end of the Tunnel.(b) Development of New TrafficIf the transfer of existing cross-Channel traffic to a tunnel would involvehigher and not lower current charges, the economic case for a Channel Tunnelmust rest on the additional traffic that would be developed. (This additionaltraffic could not be simply the traffic passing by other cross-Channel routes,since this should be taken into account under (a).)The expectation of additional traffic must now be weaker than in 1929.It has always been recognised that the major source of revenue would bre from passenger traffic and that goods traffic would bring in only a small proportion of the total revenue. But passenger traffic is being carriedincreasingly by air; and there is no longer the same case for building a tunnel in order to allow the journey to Paris to be made faster, or by night in order to save time, and the argument against the air is mainly one ofdependability.The calculations made in 1929 suggested that the traffic likely to be diverted tothe Tunnel might amount to 230,000 tons of imports plus 30,000 tons of exports andre-exports. The increase in trade likely to result from the construction of theTunnel, together with the probable growth during the period of construction, was put, very speculatively, at a third. It was emphasised that the induced increase would be mainly in perishable agricultural produce and valuable luxury goods,and that &quot;the direct stimulus to British exports would be very limited.&quot; Inpresent circumstances it is most unlikely that a large increase in imports ofperishable food-stuffs and luxuries would occur and doubtful whether it wouldbe permitted. Moreover, the experience of the past twenty years does not point to any steady increase in goods traffic through the Channel ports. In 1927 the weight of imports through Dover and Folkestone was 184,000 tons; in 1938 itwas 152,000 tons; in 1947 it was 139,000 tons* These figures hardly supportthe expectation of a secular expansion of traffic.   There is less traffic to be
-diverted to the tunnel than twenty years ago, and it is no longer likely that this traffic would be augmented either with the passage of time or because of the.greater convenience of the tunnel as a means of transport.The 1929 estimate of passenger traffic was a maximum of 3 million singlejourneys. This estimate was obtained by aggregating the 1928 total forjourneys between Dover or Folkestone and Calais or Boulogne, adding a further200,000 for passengers diverted from other routes, 200,000 for Americans induced to come to Britain instead of going straight to the Continent, and an allowance for &quot; some further stimulation of travel.&quot; At the time when the estimate wasmade, the number of air passengers between Britain and Europe was 48,000 perannum. By 1938 it had risen to about 170,000; and in 1948 it was over 600,000.The number of cross-Channel passengers using Folkestone and Dover rose from1 - 5 million in 1929 to 1 - 8 million in 1937, but by 1948 was down again to1-1 million. The main effect of air services has probably been to reduce trafficvia Tilbury and Southampton; but it is inconceivable that traffic via Dover andFolkestone has not also suffered. The rate at which air transport is expandingmakes it extremely difficult to estimate passenger traffic via the Tunnel at ahigher rate in ten years&apos; time than would be likely if the Tunnel already existed;and the traffic would certainly be much less now (perhaps by nearly half) thanthe maximum of 3 million suggested in 1929. It is hard to justify heavy capital-expenditure to meet a demand that has fallen below expectations and is tending to decline. .(B) Other objections arise from the present shortage of capital. Theconstruction of a tunnel might cost about  100 million and take ten years tocomplete. Although the current rate of interest to the Government may be only a little over 3 per cent, the true cost of capital to the country is far greater.The provision of, say,  100 million of capital for ten years without any returnrequires the prospect of a very large return at a later date. No such return islikely.Moreover, the project would represent a large outlay on transport at the verymoment when the Investment Programmes Committee have just reported that:it will be necessary to curtail capital expenditure on the transport system overthe next few years. Many valuable schemes, which are undoubtedly necessaryin the interests of economic development, are already held up and will be held upindefinitely. Would the Channel Tunnel take precedence over the Severn Tunnelfor example? Or over improving communications between the Midlands andSouth Wales?  Or over extensions to the London underground system?The last occasion when the Channel Tunnel was reported upon was in 1930,when it seemed possible that it might be justified as a means of providing employ-ment. No such justification can now be offered. If the unemployment to be countered is of a cyclical kind, it would be preferable to treat schemes like theChannel Tunnel independently of employment considerations, since the periodof their construction exceeds the normal length of a trade cycle. If, however,continuing large-scale unemployment has to be faced, the Channel Tunnel shouldbe considered alongside other alternative projects on which the economic returnto be expected is small.3. Quasi-Military AspectsThe attitude of the Government to a Channel Tunnel has depended more on military than on economic considerations. On the military aspects of thescheme the Board of Trade is not called upon to express a view. It cannotdisregard, however, that a vast amount may be spent on something that mighthave to be extensively damaged or completely destroyed in the event of a war.If military considerations are paramount, there must be many other holes inthe ground that it would be more advantageous to dig. Or if money must be spent to make cross-Channel voyages faster with an eye to eventual militaryadvantage, what more obvious source of strength than an expansion in air traffic ?* These figures may not be comparable as the two later figures come from the Ministry of transports enquiry into the turn round of shipping while the earlier figure is from the Board of&apos; Trade.Board of Trade, S.W. 1,lbth June, 1949.
APPENDIX DMemorandum by the Minister of transport the project for a channel tunnel has been examined on a number of occasions-over many years, and in a White Paper (Cmd. 3591) issued in June 1930 the-Government of the day announced that: &quot;Having regard to the element of doubt as to the feasibility of con-struction, the weakness of the economic case, the great cost, the long period before which capital expenditure would fructify, and the small amount ofemployment provided in comparison with expenditure, the Government have come to the conclusion that there is no justification for a reversal of the policypursued by successive Governments for nearly 50 years.&quot;Employment conditions and the European political background were, ofcourse, very different in 1930, but most of the objections of 1930 still hold good.2. The 1930 scheme was for twin railway tunnels. More recently there hasbeen talk of adding a road tunnel as well. If a traffic tunnel of any sort werefeasible, the inclusion of a road tunnel in it would be a practicable engineeringproposition but would greatly increase the cost.3. In 1930, the tunnel was estimated to cost some  30 million. This didnot include approaches, stations or electric locomotives. It would be necessary at least to double this figure to allow for present costs, and to add to it a largebut undetermined figure for the road tunnel. If sums of this magnitude areavailable for transport works, there are many which would make a far higher;economic return for the outlay.4.   The idea of a through route between this country and the Continent isattractive, and the psychological value of such a work to the unity of Europe?would be great.   But I doubt whether the tunnel would really serve even theinterests of United Europe.  At present we are linked to Europe by a network of short-sea services working from a number of well-equipped packet ports on.both sides of the Channel.   The services are maintained by a fleet of vesselsspecially constructed for cross-channel traffic.   Except for the Belgian-ownedDover-Ostend service (operated jointly by the Southern Region (British Railways)and the Belgian Marine), a Dutch vessel shortly to re-open the Flushing route,five French vessels sharing the Newhaven-Dieppe services with the SouthernRegion, and one of the three train ferries on the Dover-Dunkerque night ferryservice, all these continental services are British owned.  A railway-owned fleet of 46 vessels totalling 100,000 gross tons and 48 vessels of 36,000 gross tons-owned by eight independent liner companies maintain regular passenger andcargo services.   These vessels include train and car ferries which are capable-of development.If the tunnel were built it would seriously damage our merchant shipping;it would monopolise cross-channel traffic, and shipping services would of necessitywither away.  In war we should be forced to rely upon one highly vulnerable andnecessarily inadequate tunnel, instead of having our communications spread over -a large number of ports and routes capable of handling a very large traffic.5. The maintenance of the present shipping routes and particularly theimprovement and development of the train ferry services (at an infinitely lesscost than a tunnel) are probably the right policy for us to pursue. There has been an attempt on the subordinate bodies of the Economic Commission for europe to make the proposed international network of roads an argument for urging theconstruction of a channel tunnel. The existing cross-channel ferries, suitablyimproved, should provide the&apos; links between this international network on theContinent and its projection in this country.6.   We are now of course as we were not in 1930 making great efforts to?attract tourists, but how far a tunnel, which could not do away with the customs and other formalities, would prove a greater attraction than improved sea services-is very doubtful.
Ministry of Transport, W. 1,June, 1949.7. If a Channel Tunnel were available for road traffic, we might well find that the advocacy now being given in international transport meetings to theview of the &quot; Freedom of the Road &quot; carried embarrassing practical implications for us. Our present Carriers&apos; Licensing system is not conducive to &quot; Freedom ofthe Road,&quot; but if we had a Channel Road Tunnel we should have to amend ourlegislation or we should be accused of deliberately preventing traffic using theTunnel.8.   I make no comment on any influence the Tunnel might exercise on theifiow of imports and exports, which is not my primary concern, beyond sayingthat I know of no transport hindrances to our exports to the Continent.
