(49) 15821st July, 1949CABINETTHE DOLLAR situation memorandum by the Prime minister in E.P.C. (49) 66 of 22nd June the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave an analysis of the dollar position on the basis of such information as was available at the time..................   i. .. .....2. I feelthat my colleagues should have an opportunity of considering thelatest information now available.   The main facts are as follows: -3. The Reserves. -Our reserves of gold and United States and Canadiandollars at 30th June amounted to  406 million compared with  471 million at1st April, representing a decrease of  65 million during the second quarter. the decrease would, in fact, have been much larger but &quot;for the receipt in the closingdays of June of considerable sums of money in the shape of reimbursements fromthe Economic Co-operation Administration of expenditure already incurred byus. These large receipts were the result of special measures taken by our repre-sentatives in Washington to reduce the amounts still owing to us by E.C.A.and they have been followed by a sharp reduction in further reimbursements sincethe beginning of July. As a result of this and of the continued heavy gold and dollar deficit, our reserves have continued to decline rapidly and by 20th Julyhad fallen to  372 million. In other words; they have fallen by  21 million in about half a month or at a rate of over  120 million a quarter.4/ E.R.P. Receipts. E.R.P. aid in all forms during the second quarteramounted to  85 million (including  8 million received by the Irish Republic)compared with  81 million in the first quarter. But for the heavy reimbursements-already mentioned, the figure would have been a good deal less than in the first quarter. It is not possible to forecast with any accuracy what the total E.R.P.assistance in the third quarter is likely to be, but it can hardlv be much in excessof  70 million.5. Gold and Dollar Deficit. The monthly gold.and dollar deficits duringthe second quarter were as follows : $ millionApril............      ...      ... 149May    .................. 228June    ...       ...      ...      ...       ...      ... 255632(or  157 million)The figure of  157 million is to be compared with the following quarterly deficitssince E.R.P. began at the beginning of April, 1948 :  107 million,  76 million, 93 million,  82 million.37302
6.   The course of the deficit in recent weeks is shown below : $ millionWeek ending                                         . v4th June    ...............11th June    ...       ............ -on18th June    ............... ?l&apos;fi25th June    ............... &apos; i ^2nd July     ............... 68-b9th July    ...    ............. 116th July (provisional)The present week (ending 23rd July) will be a heavy one, as we shall have topay f 18 million to Belgium and $11 million to Switzerland for the settlement ofthe sterling area deficits with these countries in June.7. The deficit is still, therefore, running at the rate of over $50 million aweek which is equivalent to over  600 million a year. At this rate, even if we assume that we are allotted over  200 million in E.R.P. assistance during 1949-50and can continue to draw on the Canadian Credit on the same scale as recently(i.e., $10 million a month), the whole of our remaining reserves would disappearwithin about a year.8. Some provisional details of the make-up of the sterling area gold and dollar deficit in the second quarter have been compiled and are shown in theAppendix, together with figures for the first quarter and the forecasts for thesecond quarter which were&apos;made early in April.9. These estimates show that though United Kingdom purchases in theUnited States were larger in the second quarter than in the first, they fell a gooddeal short of the original forecasts. This was due partly to lack of availability of some items and partly to action which was taken to cancel purchases duringthe quarter.10. United Kingdom export proceeds were not very much less than in thefirst quarter, but very substantially below what was expected. It should benoted that since the figures given relate to export proceeds they do not fully reflect the reduction in actual shipments to the United States which has taken place.These continue to decline. In June they were only  3-0 million compared with 3 - 7 million in May,  3 - 4 million in April and a monthly average of  5-8 million in the first quarter. Exports to Canada were also lower in June than in May,but very little less in the second than in the first quarter as a whole. It is too soon to say whether the drop in June denotes the beginning of a new downwardtrend and we shall have to watch subsequent figures with great care.11. During the second quarter, there was a sharp deterioration in theposition of the dollar invisibles. This is partly the result of unexpectedly heavy expenditure on certain items, such as dividend transfers and the outlays of british oil companies. There was also a reduction in our receipts from oil sales. Finally,a large conversion of American sterling balances took place in April and is reflected in the figures. Since April, however, these balances appear to have been reasonably stable.12. Dependent overseas territories (D.O.T.s) and the countries in theindependent rest of the sterling area (R.S.A.) all fared worse in the second quarter in comparison both with the first quarter and with our earlier expecta-tions of the second. As far as the D.O.Ts. are concerned, this was the resultprimarily of a sharp reduction in United States purchases of rubber, cocoa and tin. Receipts from all colonial exports to the United States in the second quarterare provisionally estimated at $64 million compared with $115 million in thefirst quarter. The increased deficit of the independent R.S.A. countries withthe United States is also, in part, the result of lower income, particularly fromsales of wool and jute. But some increase in expenditure has also taken place,particularly by Pakistan.13. Our settlements with Switzerland and Belgium were much heavier thanin the first quarter, and large payments will also have to be made to both thismonth. There is no evidence at the moment that the position with regard tothese countries is improving, and although the new intra-European paymentsscheme in 1949-50 should reduce the drain to Belgium, any excess in our deficitover that agreed between us in advance will still have to be met in gold.
38914. Our gold losses to other countries, particularly Persia, were lower inthe second quarter than in the first and even lower than we had expected. Butthere is no reason to believe that this is more than a temporary respite. In june the Persian loss had again increased to about $10 million.15. The above facts bring the story of our gold and dollar position as upto date as possible. All the evidence suggests that expenditure both by theUnited Kingdom and the rest of the sterling area is still on a heavy scale, and thatsome time must elapse before the measures taken here and those recommended toother Commonwealth Governments as the result of the Finance Ministers&apos; Meetingcan begin to take effect. Meanwhile there are few signs of any recovery in our dollar income (apart from a resumption of United States purchases of tin towardsthe end of June, which is the only favourable development that can be reported).Gold and dollar settlements to non-dollar countries are likely to remain high, atleast until the arrangements with Belgium come into operation.16. The general conclusion, therefore, must be that for some time ahead thecurrent heavy deficit is likely to continue and with it a continued drain on thegold and dollar reserves. It is impossible at this stage to forecast with any assurance what the extent of this drain is likely to be over the next month or two.But it would be over-optimistic to hope that our reserves at the end of the currentquarter will stand much above  300 million.C.
