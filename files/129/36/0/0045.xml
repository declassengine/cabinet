THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT-    299Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1949SECRET Copy No, 31CP. (49) 19528th September, 1949CABINETIRON AND STEEL BILL:   HIVING OFFMemorandum by the Minister of Supply1. At the meeting of the Socialisation of Industries Committee on27th. July last my Memorandum (S.I. (M) (49) 42) on the proposed splitting upof Dorman Long &amp; Company, Limited, with a view to the retention by privateenterprise of the structural engineering and chemical activities, was considered(S.I. (M) (49) 10th Meeting, Minute 4), and there was agreement that the issues raised were of such importance that they should be settled by the Cabinet.2. The Bill takes over the 96 named companies (together with their sub-sidiaries) which are most extensively engaged in the basic sections of the industry,but the activities of these companies and their subsidiaries range extensivelyinto end- and by-products. The Bill contains complex provisions to secure that each entity which passes to public ownership is reasonably comparable with that existing in October 1948.3. It was always our intention that certain of the activities of these com-panies, which were far removed from what is normally understood to be withinthe iron and steel industry, could be hived off either by the new Corporation or,with my consent, before they vested in the Corporation. I stated the Government&apos;policy in the following terms on Second Reading: &quot; The Government have no desire to stand in the way of the normaldevelopment of the industry, and if any company has sound plans for dividingitself up between iron and steel and related activities on the one hand and clearly unrelated activities on the other, I shall be prepared to consider such proposals sympathetically if, and only if, it can be shown that the two parts are independent of each other, that each will be a viable unit and thatthere are good economic reasons for separation.&quot;4. In general, the industry has set its face resolutely against the breaking up of integrated undertakings where that integration had taken place for soundtechnical reasons, and in the relatively few applications which I have receivedit has generally been possible to reach a solution which is fair to the shareholdersand would not be embarrassing to the new Corporation.5. The Dorman Long application is in a different category, both because ofthe size of the company itself, and the relative importance of the business whichit is proposed to split off and retain in private ownership. By a series ofamalgamations during the last two generations, the company is now the largestsingle producer of pig iron and of steel ingots and of rolled steel products; ithas extensive iron ore and limestone interests, and chemical by-product activities in association with the National Coal Board and LCI. In addition, the company,both under its own name and through its subsidiaries (Teeside Bridge and engineering Company, and Redpath Brown &amp; Co.), is responsible for some 25 percent, of the structural engineering industry in Great Britain. 12 per cent, to15 per cent, of the group&apos;s structural output is now being exported to various37634
parts of the world for erection in the name of the parent company- There aresubsidiary structural engineering companies in Africa and in South America, and while the parent company can exercise control, a minority of the equity capitalis held locally; the company operating in South Africa is particularly flourishing,and while most of its steel is purchased locally from the nationalised SouthAfrican Steel Works, it can draw upon the experience of the parent company.6. The structural engineering and chemical sides are physically distinct,and I am satisfied that there would be little difficulty in agreeing an appropriatedivision between them and steel-making proper. Roughly the proposal involvestwo-thirds of the business passing to public ownership, and one-third remaining in private ownership. I am satisfied, too, that the reason why the company is inthe structural engineering business at all was its desire in the 1920&apos;s and 1930&apos;sto obtain an assured outlet for its own steel products in a highly competitivemarket open to the whole world; for example, the company, without any previous experience in bridge works, tendered for and obtained the Sydney Bridge contractprimarily to keep its mills going. Its success with the Sydney Bridge and subsequent contracts has given the firm a world-wide reputation which rests inthe eyes of foreigners on its credit as engineers rather than as steel makers.7. The arguments in favour of authorising the split may be summarisedas follows : (a) Structural engineering is not commonly regarded as part of the ironand steel industry, which it is the purpose of the Bill to nationalise,and refusal of this application might invite the criticism that theGovernment Were using the Bill to secure public ownership of asubstantial proportion of quite a different industry.(b) The economic and competitive factors which induced a private firm ofsteel makers to obtain an assured market would not apply when theindustry is publicly owned; in so far as the hew Corporation gaveany preference iii supplies tb the Dormah Long group, there would beinfringement of the non-discrimination provisions in the Bill.(c) There is some risk that the overseas business of the group, and particularlythat of the African subsidiary, would suffer through prejudice against an agent of His Majesty&apos;s Government operating in competition with local enterprise. There is little advantage in public ownership ofthe overseas companies as an outlet for British steel, as they now buythis steel only when it is locally competitive with foreign supplies.(d) Structural engineering contracts, both at home and particularly overseas,where civil engineering work is frequently included, are speculative,and require flexibility, devolution of managerial responsibility and freedom in negotiation; the new Corporation might not wish, or be best fitted, to be involved in the complexities of public workscontracting in many parts of the world.8.   The arguments against approval are (a) In the rehabilitation of our economy at home, the structural engineering industry is of importance and ownership of one-quarter of that industry would enable the Corporation to exercise a powerful influence over its policy, in price, design, and economy in steel consumption.(b) New developments in steel design are constantly taking place, and therewould be some technical advantage in maintaining a close liaison between the steel producing and steel consuming activities of theDorman Long group (but common ownership is not imperative t6 thisend).(c) The Bill deliberately seeks the acquisition of companies as they stand;the Dorman Long organisation has proved itself good for privateenterprise, and there is no doubt that some damage would result frombreaking up this well integrated and smoothly working organisation.9. While Dorman Long&apos;s control 25 per cent, of the structural steel industryin this country, other steel companies between them control a further 5 per cent.If the Dorman Long proposal were approved, similar approval would probably have to be given in respect of some of the remaining 5 per cent.
300a    *Ministry of Supply,Shell Mex House, W.C. 2,28th September, 1949.10. I have given serious consideration to whether it would be practical toauthorise a split merely of the overseas interests of the company, but I havereached the conclusion that this would not be feasible. The only sound economic or technical line, if a line is to be drawn, is between steelmaking on the one handand structural engineering (whether for home or abroad) on the other.11. The arguments on both sides are nicely balanced and no great harmwould accrue to the new Corporation whether the proposed split is approved ornot. My own view is primarily influenced by the advantages which I shouldanticipate in a wider sphere from the public ownership of an important element in the constructional field; and I have therefore a bias in favour of rejection; butI recognise that there are good arguments in favour of approval and I submit thecase for the decision of my colleagues.G.
