(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (49) 15720TH JULY,  1949CABINETBECHUANALAND PROTECTORATESUCCESSION TO THE CHIEFTAINSHIP OF the bamangwato TRIBEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth RelationsSince circulating CP. (49) 155 I have given further serious consideration to the problem presented by SeretseKhama&apos;s marriage and have come to the conclusion that itmight be best, before deciding either to refuse recognitionor to set up a judicial enquiry, to propose to the HighCommissioner that Seretse should be asked to return to thiscountry for discussions at the Commonwealth Relations Office.I feel that there is some hope that if we can have a frankdiscussion with Seretse and his wife, they may both decide that it would be undesirable that Seretse should take up the chieftainship of the Tribe.     The reasons which haveinfluenced me in making this proposal are set out in theattached draft telegram which, if my colleagues concur, Ishould like to send to the High Commissioner...   85COPY NO.   3/P. J.  N. -B.Commonwealth Relations Office,S.W. 1.20TH JULY, 1949.&apos;   annex draft TELEGRAM TO UNITED kingdom high COMMISSIONER.  PRETORIANo. Secret and Personal.I have been considering further the difficult problem presented by the Seretse affair.     While I agree thatthere is much to be said for your x^proposal for a judicial enquiry we cannots it seems to me, ignore the possibility thatsuch an enquiry might resxilt in a report favourable to the  &apos;recognition of Seretse on. the ground that there is nothingagainst his personal character and suitability and that themajority of the Tribe appear to have definitely accepted him as Chief as a result of the proceedings at the recent meetings.Further discussions with the Tribe might in fact merelyconfirm this verdict.2. If this should be- the result of the enquiry weshould still be faced with the grave political difficulties to which you have called attention and it would have become allthe more difficult to refuse to recognise Seretse.      I note infact that you say that the local administration feel that ifwe are ever to go against Seretse we should do so now.

3. My present feeling is that Tshekadi is so highlyesteemed by pro-native opinion in this country that a refusal to recognise Seretse would not necessarily cause any serious political embarrassment here.      But the consideration whichmainly weighs with me is the grave danger that Seretse&apos;srecognition might lead to an insistent demand for the transferof the Bechuanaland Protectorate to the Union and indeedpossibly forcible action on the part of extremists in theUnion.      The final result might therefore be disastrous notonly to Seretse himself, but to the entire native populationof the Protectorate.k* Paced with this dilemma I have been wonderingwhether it might not be desirable to ask Seretse to return toEngland for discussion of his position at this Office.      there seems to me a certain chance that he might be prepared to with-draw his claim to the Chieftainship, if he appreciated thedifficulties felt by the United Kingdom Government, though I realise that we should have to proceed very diplomatically.We should presumably have to offer some financial assistance by way of a yearly allowance.      I think that there might be acertain advantage in asking him to return here rather thaninstructing you to conduct the discussion with him, and itwould presumably be helpful in deferring the departure of his wife to join him in South Africa.5&apos; This proposal does not of course rule out thepossibility of our eventually having&apos;to set up a judicial enquiry if as a result of the talks with Seretse it becomesevident that this will be the best course.     -But a certainamount of delay will not be disadvantageous, assuming that thetribal&apos; administration can function satisfactorily in the mean-time.      I assume that Tshekedi still remains as Acting Chiefuntil you have recognised a successor.6. As you have already had some discussion with Seretseyou. will be able to judge better than I can. what his reactionis likely to be to the above proposal.      If, however, you findyourself in agreement with my suggestion I should be glad ifyou would, when you visit Mafeking, tell him that I should likehim to return here for a discussion at the Commonwealth RelationOffice regarding his position and suggest that he should proceed by air as soon as possible.      You would presumably agree thatthe cost of his journey, and if necessary a subsistence allow-ance while he is here, should be paid from bechuanaland protectorate fund.7* This telegram has been prepared in consultation with my Ministerial colleagues.
