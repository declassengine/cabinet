MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES

On 23rd June (C.M. (49) 42nd Conclusion, Minute 5) the Cabinet invited us to submit proposals on long-term policy in respect of Hong Kong. As our colleagues are aware, the United States authorities have asked us for information about our policy towards Hong Kong (telegram No. 113 of 8th June from the United Kingdom Delegation to the Council of Foreign Ministers, Paris, at Annex A). There is also outstanding a considered reply to the telegram No. 385 of 1st June (at Annex B) from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Australian outlining the attitude of the Australian Prime Minister towards the situation in Hong Kong.

2. At Annex C we give some factual information about Hong Kong, some notes on the value to ourselves, to the local inhabitants, and indeed to China itself, of the maintenance of the British connection and on our ability to maintain our position there in the face of Chinese hostility. Annex D is a summary of assurances given by His Majesty&apos;s Government since 1948 about the future of Hong Kong: and a map of the Colony is also annexed.

3. Our consideration of the problem of Hong Kong has led us to the conclusion that, since it is not possible to predict with any certainty how the situation will develop in China, it is not at present either possible or desirable to attempt to determine a long-term policy for the future of Hong Kong. In some respects the situation we are faced with in Hong Kong is similar to that which faced us--and to some extent still faces us--in Berlin. Just as we cannot ? with certainty how the future of Berlin will develop but are convinced of the ? of remaining there, so we are impelled to remain in Hong Kong without any clear indication of the extent or duration of the military commitment involved. In both cases the threat of Russian and Communist expanssionism ? holding what we have and not withdrawing.

4. In the case of Hong Kong there are (over and above our ? legal right to be there) other urgent reasons for our remaining. These reasons are summarised in paragraph 3 of Annex C.

5. The weakness of our future position in Hong Kong arises from the fact, which we must accept, that both Nationalism and Communism in China are likely to have as their aim the eventual recovery by one means or another not only of the ? Territories but also of the ceded areas of the Colony. Such recovery would be attempted by the threat or actual use of force; by pressure, or by potential ?

Threat or Actual Use of Force

6. We have already taken steps to meet the threat or actual use of force, and, the position being thus safeguarded, it may well be found that no threat will develop. We have indicated clearly that we are not prepared to allow interference by the Chinese Communists in our own territories, and this indication of


Policy has strengthened local morale. Were we, however, to withdraw our forces, and thus allow it to be implied that we are not prepared to stand our ground, the results throughout South-East Asia would be disastrous. There is no doubt that the successes of the Chinese Communists have already had a profound effect is this region where there are very large Chinese populations. It is a characteristic of Chinese, wherever they may be, to come to terms with the Government in being in China proper. There are already signs, for example in Siam, that this process has begun. Unless it is made unmistakably clear that the Governments of South-East Asia territories are firmly determined to fulfil there obligations and to suppress Chinese Communist interference in their affairs, there is a very real danger that Chinese communities in these areas will support the Communist cause, not so much from conviction as from a traditional tendency to give way to the inevitable.

7. We cannot afford to allow South-East Asia to become dominated by Communism. Apart from our historical obligations towards Malaya and the fact that it is our most important dollar earner, South-East Asia is a provider of food-stuffs and raw materials which are essential to the economy of the West as a whole. From the economic point of view alone, the loss of this region would be a disaster. Politically and strategically the consequences would be equally grave.

8. The fact that Asian peoples tend as a rule to swing in the direction of greater power makes it essential that we should not weaken at Hong Kong. For weakness there would be interpreted without any doubt as the beginning of a general retreat, and the Asian peoples would immediately begin to turn their thoughts towards making terms with the new power of Communism as the only viable alternative.

9. It can be argued that in our straitened circumstances we cannot afford to remain so extended so far from the centre of our own activities and commitments in Europe and the Middle East. But the preceding paragraphs provide evidence that we cannot afford to abandon our position in South-East Asia. Nor shall we be entirely alone and without support if we decide to stay. The United States Secretary of State is reported as having said at a recent press conference that, if any action were taken against Hong Kong which the United States considered a violation of the Charter of the United Nations, then the United States would fully meet its obligations under the Charter. If support of our position in Hong Kong is to be maintained, it is important to explain it fully to our friends and in particular to the other members of the British Commonwealth and the United States.

The Use of Pressure

10. The same considerations as those mentioned above apply to attempts by the Chinese Communists to render our position in Hong Kong untenable by stirring up internal unrest, strikes, &amp;c. Only the evidence that we are prepared to deal with these attempts will convince the Chinese population of Hong Kong that stable government under British aegis will continue. Given that conviction, they will prefer British law and order to Chinese chaos and disorder, even though they will not admit this in public; if they lack that conviction they will come to terms with the Communists even though they may fear and dislike them.

Peaceful Negotiation

11. There remains to be considered an attempt by a Chinese Government to recover Hong Kong through peaceful negotiation. The Chinese Government of the day raised the question of the termination of the lease of the New Territories at the time of the surrender of our extra-territorial rights in China in January 1943. They were told that in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government it was a matter for consideration "after victory was won." The "Hong Kong problem" was raised again by Chiang Kai-shek in 1946 and also by Dr. Wellington Koo, then Chinese Ambassador in London, but it was not pressed. It is hardly a live issue any longer with the National Government of China.

12. If and when a Communist Central Government of China is set up, it is conceivable that they may seek to initiate discussions with the United Kingdom about the future of Hong Kong. This presupposes that we, together with other Powers, have entered into diplomatic relations with the new Government. For


our part, however, we must postulate that in addition we should not be prepared to discuss the future of Hong Kong with the new Government unless it were friendly, democratic, stable and in control of a united China.

13. We cannot agree to negotiate about Hong Kong with a Government which is unfriendly, since we should be negotiating under duress. We should equally refuse to discuss the future of Hong Kong with a Government which is undemocratic, since we should not be prepared to hand the people of Hong Kong over to a Communist regime. Finally, we should be unwilling to discuss Hong Kong with a China which is not united, because its future would be likely to become a pawn in the contest between conflicting factions. Unless there were a stable Government we could not rely on it to preserve Hong Kong as a secure free port and place of exchange between China and the rest of the world.

14. On the basis of present information a Communist Government of China, when it is set up, is unlikely to fulfil any of the conditions enumerated in the preceding paragraph. The question of discussing the future of Hong Kong is therefore likely to be academic for much time to come, and no useful purpose should be served at this stage by trying to estimate how we should meet a hypothetical situation.

15. The lease of the New Territories is due to expire in 1997. It does not seem likely that when that time comes any Chinese Government will be prepared to renew the lease. Without these territories Hong Kong would be untenable, and it is therefore probable that before 1997 the United Kingdom Government of the day will have to consider the status of Hong Kong. But we are surely not justified some two generations in advance of the event in attempting to lay down the principles which should govern any arrangement which it may be possible to reach with China at that time. In the intervening years there will be developments of one kind or another in China, and it is upon these developments that the willingness or otherwise of the United Kingdom Government of the day to reach an accommodation will probably depend.

Conclusion

16. The conclusion which we reach is therefore that, while we should be prepared to discuss the future of Hong Kong with a friendly and democratic and stable Government of a unified China, the conditions under which such discussions could be undertaken do not exist at present and are unlikely to exist in the foreseeable future. Until conditions change, we intend to remain in Hong Kong and should so inform other Commonwealth Governments and the United States, while refraining in public from pronouncements which exacerbate our relations with China.

Recommendations

17. We recommend -

(i) that the Foreign Secretary be authorised to communicate to the United States Secretary of State for his confidential information the conclusion of this paper and the reasons which have led to it, and that he should seek the support of the United States Government;

(ii) that the Lord Privy Seal should similarly inform other Commonwealth Governments.

The people of Hong Kong are very sensitive to the slightest suggestion that His Majesty&apos;s Government might be contemplating negotiations with China about Hong Kong and the merest hint at present that this possibility was being even considered, let alone discussed with other Governments, would destroy the confidence which it has taken considerable military reinforcements to build up. Every precaution should therefore be taken to guard against any leakage and the importance of this should be stressed in the approaches to other Governments.

ANNEX ATelegram No. 113 from Council of Foreign,- Ministers,. Paris (UnitedKingdom Delegation), to the Foreign :office.-    Bth June, J949.Following from Secretary ofStateAt Mr. Aobeson&apos;s suggestion, I arranged for Mr. Barclay to call on him thismorning to hear some points which the State Department wished to put to us aboutHong Kong. -&apos;-        - -   \(   *; &apos; *&apos;        J,.2. Mr. Acheson said that in the view of the United States Government itwas unlikely that the Chinese Communists would launch a full-scale militaryattack on Hong Kong. If they did, the position would be clear and the UnitedStates would certainly back us in every Way they could. What seemed muchmore likely, however, was that the Communists wodld in due course demand theretrocession of Hong Kong or at any rate the surrender of the new territories.If we refused, they would probably apply an economic boycott or blockade and create the greatest possible amount of disturbance by infiltration. Mr. Achesonmentioned that the State Department view was that the Communist authorities would back their demands by quoting the assurance given to the Chinese Govern-ment in 1942 that His Majesty^ Government would be ready after the war todiscuss the terms of the leases of the new territories.3. In the circumstances, the United States Government were anxious toknow how we would propose to act if the Communists used all measures short of armed attack. What would be the extent and the possible duration of the jpro-tectvve measures which might be necessary on our part arid how far would Britisheconomic interests in Hong Kong be willing to play their part?4. The State Department also wished to know what we hoped might comefrom an appeal to the United Nations, particularly in view of the fact that theChinese Communists are not represented there and are not even an establishedGovernment.5. Mr. Acheson said it would help to clarify American thinking on thiswhole problem if we could give him some sort of answer to these questions.ANNEX BTelegram No. 365 from the United Kingdom High Commissioner inAustralia1st June, 1949.Following is text of reply from Mr. Chifiey to Mr. Attlee&apos;s message in yourtelegram No. 409 as supplemented by oral explanations on lines of your telegramNo. 407:--1. I have received your personal message about Hong Kong and have dis-cussed with your High Commissioner at Canberra your assessment of the military position there and the factors which have persuaded you to send additionalreinforcements.2. It is obviously of the highest importance that the colonies [sic&apos;] shouldbe protected against any irregular or regular attack which might develop in thenear future. The United Kingdom Government has, an obligation in this respectby reason of the fact that it is the administering authority. With this in mind,the Australian Government supports your recent decision to reinforce the HongKong&apos; Garrison.3. Any requests now or in the future from the United Kingdom Governmentfor material support in the form of any army, naval or air force personnel and munitions for the defence of Hong Kong would have to be considered by Cabinet.I feel Cabinet would not be prepared to send material support to meet a full-scale attack on Hong Kong, for this would most likely involve full-scale war with theChinese Government.
4. However, in considering .the matter&apos;my coUeagties.and.1 would be influenced by the immediate steps&quot; that&apos;the tJnited IQfigdbm Governrhen&apos;have taken to preve^rthe-development.of an attackwithin the, csxt fewby means of direct, negotiation and;. agreement with-the Communist autnow in control of the large area pf, China. It-seems,to us that.even thaattack which might develop within Jhe: next few. months could be metreinforcements at present proposed, and even though the presence, oreinforcements were sufficient to prevent the attack developing, holdingKong by. force in the years to come may not be possible, and an attempt 1may easily lead to a major conflict. . In our view the main endeavour to the  future of Hong Kong should be by positive means based on relations Ithe seemingly new Government and the Western countries.- - 5. This raises the general questions of recognition and trade relaticwere dealt with in my message to the Foreign Secretary of 25th May. Asit we shall he forced ultimately to recognise seme kind of Communistin China, and we would hope to be able to carry on normal relations witba Communist-dominated China should deoide to withdraw from all contaWestern countries and turn its face towards Soviet Russia, this majimpossible. But until it is shown to be impossible we consider that nothingbe done which might tend to discourage the Chinese Communists from preand cultivating China&apos;s normal contacts with Western countries.6. So far as we are aware, the Communists have not yet issued any ]threat against the integrity of Hong Kong. We understand that they have that their attitude towards Hong Kong will be determined by the tof Western countries towards Formosa. If this, in fact, represents ICommunists&apos; policy^ there would seem to be everything in favour of trreach a clear understanding with them on the future of Hong Kong asSjsible. There should be little difficulty in convincing them that, so far asmmonwealth countries are concerned, the formal restoration of. FontChina as envisaged at Cairo and again at Potsdam only awaits the cosof a peace treaty with Japan, and that we already regard Formosa for all pipurposes as Chinese territory and would not wish to interfere there in ai7. In addition, we would like to feel that everything possible waidone to allow Hong Kong to perform its rightful function as a commerctrade centre. The accumulated experience and unrivalled facilities oiKong as a trade entrepot provide m our view the best hope that the (Communists will not wish to disturb it. There is already evidence that tbmunists are prepared to give preferential.treatment to well-established iithat can provide them with the goods they need. The more they are enccto enter into commercial dealings with Britain and American enterpriseslikely they are to seek to integrate the Chinese economy entirely with :Soviet Bussia. In Hong Kong they would find a reari^made and efficient (through which they could trade andwhich could deliver the goods they neshbrt, we consider that more attention to the normal commercial functHong Kong and less to its defence may be found not only to provide tsafeguard for the security of Hong Kong, but also to offer the best chtestablishing a practical working relationship with the Chinese Comiagainst the day when they are in control of all China;8.  We would like to think that these possibilities have been very caconsidered.  In our view they provide a basis for a positive approachproblem of Hong Kong and, indeed, China as a whole, as distinct from the a one of sitting back and awaiting developments. If the Communists sboul* to the point of deciding &apos;to gain control&apos; of Hong Kong, we are dubious ab1 deterrent effect of a reinforced- garrisonl Even if the Communists decideB risk a direct attack, they might well succeed in undermining British (particularly in the leased territory, by insisting on their transit rights urn1888 Peking Convention. *   -        -o o9.

This raises to general questions of recognition and trade relations totwere dealt with in my message to the Foreign Secretary of 25th May. As we see it we shall be forced ultimately to recognise some kind of Coauaunistt regime in China, and we would hope to be able to carry on normal relations wiB&amp; it.

But until it is shown to be impossible we consider that nothing afiaaMhe done which might tend to discourage the Chinese Communists from preserving,and cultivating Cnina&apos;s normal contacts with Western countries.6. So far as we are aware, to Communists have not yet issued any positive-threat against the integrity of Hong Kong. We understand that toy have feintedthat their attitude towards Hong Kong Will be determined by to attitudeof Western countries towards Formosa. If this, in facfi^ represents chinese communists&apos; policy, there would seem to be everything in favour of trying toreach a clear understanding with torn on to future ox Hong Hong as coon aspossible. There should be little difficulty in convincing them  bat, so far as British:Commonwealth countries are concerned, the formal restoration of Formosa to china as envisaged at Cairo and again at Potsdam only awaits to conclusionsof a peace treaty with Japan, and that we already regard Formosa for all practical purposes as Chinese territory and would not wish to interfere tore in any way.7. In addition, we would like to feel that everything possible was being done to allow Hong Kong to perform its rightful function as a commercial; anatrade centre.

In Hong Kong toy would-find a ready-made and efficient channelthrough which toy could trade and which could deliver to goods toy need. Insnort, we. consider, that more attention to -the normal commercial Junctions of hong Kong and (less to its defence may-be found not only to provide to Bestsafeguard for the security of Hong Kong, but also to offer to best chance ofestablishing a practical working relationship with, to Chinese Communistsagainst to day when toy are in control of all China.&apos;8- We would like to think&apos; that these possibilities have been very carefully considered. In our view they provide a basis for a positive approach to toproblem of Hong Kong and, indeed, China ias a whole; as distinct from the negativeone of sitting back and awaiting developments. If the Communists should cometo the&apos;&quot;point of deciding &apos;to gain control of Hong Kong, we are dubious about the deterrent effect of a reinforced&apos; gamsoh: Even if the Communists decide not to risk a direct attack, toy might well succeed in undermining British control,Pf^^fpy w the leased territory, by insisting on their transit rights under to1898 Peking Convention. 69. It seems undesirable that attempts to reach an understanding with theuornmunists on Hong Kong:and to-enter into commercial dealings with them should be left until a Communist Government is duly established and recognised.Un the contrary, there would seem to be every advantage in undertaking discus-swns witn them as soon as possible in those areas where toy are in controTrfe facto
at the present time. The United States Government should, if possible, be persuaded to associate itself in any such discussions.

10. We would like to emphasise that Australia&apos;s interest in the future of Hong Kong is in the strictest sense incidental to our interest in the future of China, and particularly in its long-term relations with the Western Powers. From Australia&apos;s point of view, Hong Kong might be regarded as a potentially valuable link between a Communist China and the West.

ANNEX C

SOME ASPECTS OF THE BRITISH CONNEXION WITH HONG KONG

The Colony

The Colony consist of :-

(i) the Island of Hong Kong (approximately 32 square miles),

(ii) part of the Kowloon Peninsula (approximately 3 square miles), and

(iii) the New Territories (approximately 359 square miles).

(i) and (ii) were ceded outright to Great Britain by China in 1842* and 1860† respectively; (iii) was leased to Great Britain by China for 69 years in 1898‡ To meet the Colony&apos;s defence needs.

Inter-relation of New Territories and ceded areas

2. Besides their importance as providing for defence in depth, the New Territories are essential to the viability of the Colony in other ways. In them are the main water reservoirs and the existing airfield of Kai Tak. The city of Kowloon has also extended into them, so that the boundary between the mainland ceded area and the New Territories now runs through a heavily built-up area. The site of the projected modern airport is in the New Territories and further adequate reservoir capacity (needed because of the insufficiency of the present water supply) can be found only in the New Territories.

Reasons for retention

The real interest and wishes of the inhabitants

3. At the time of its ceeding in 1842 Hong Kong was a desolate island with no inhabitants except a few ?. The present Chinese population of the Colony (about 1,800,000) except for the comparatively small numbers in the villages of the New Territories are almost entirely persons, or the descendants of persons, who have come to the Colony from other parts of China with the intention of living and working in British territory and under British administration. There is no reason to doubt that it is to their general advantage that the British connexion should be maintained and there is equally little reason to doubt that this is their real wish. (A plebiscite, however, would almost certainly give the opposite answer, the very fact that one was to be held would imply a possibility of return to China and very few Chinese would dare take the risk of being noted as having voted against that.)

The proposition that the population of Hong Kong, being predominantly of Chinese race, must necessarily wish to be, and ought to be, under Chinese rule is implicit in the views of ? criticism of the United Kingdom position in the Colony is based on a general dislike of the Colonial system. The attention of these critics might be ? to Formosa as an example of an island, also populated almost entirely by Chinese, which has recently been restored to Chinese rule. When Chinese forces landed in Formosa at the time of the Japanese surrender they were welcomed as liberators. But disillusion followed rapidly, and gross misgovernment by the island&apos;s new Chinese Administration led to serious discontent which culminated in a bloodily repressed revolt in 1947. In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Council in Tamsui an overwhelming majority of Formosans now desire independence from China and would even welcome a Western trusteeship in preference to continuance of the present regime.

(b) The value of a British Hong Kong as a safe, free and efficiently-run port and place of exchange for international trade in the Far East.

Every month about £20,000,000 worth of goods is handled, Hong Kong providing storage, insurance, banking and shipping facilities for this trade. In addition Hong Kong provides at present the only shipbuilding and repair facilities between Singapore and Japan. In 1921, at the peak of its prosperity, entrances and clearances were 43,500,000 gross registered tons (g.r.t.) and after the war these had recovered to 22,000,000 g.r.t. by 1948. The contrast between Shanghai under international control before the war and under Chinese control after it, and the further contrast between Hong Kong and Shanghai after the war point to the loss of security and efficiency and the increase of corruption which are likely to result if Hong Kong were to pass under Chinese control. These results would not only seriously damage international trade, but would cause grievous losses to British commercial interest, by whose exertions and enterprise the Colony has during the pass 100 years been raised to its present position.

(c) The strategic value of Hong Kong

Without entering into discussion of wider questions of general Pacific strategy, certain obvious strategic advantages of Hong Kong may be noted, viz :-

(i) it is a base from which to exert political influence in China;

(ii) it is base from which offensive operations could be conducted in China;

(iii) it is a base which would contribute to control of communications in the China seas; and 

(iv) it has the important negative strategic advantage while in our hands that its harbour and dockyards, valuable for extending the range of naval operations are denied to an enemy.

(d) The expressed or implied undertakings given by His Majesty&apos;s Government since the war that no alteration of the status of the Colony was contemplated (see Annex D).

The confidence with which British firms have gone ahead with rehabilitation and development was undoubtedly based on the ministerial pronouncements in 1944 and 1945 recorded in Annex D. If there were any question of early rendition of the Colony to China not only would such firms suffer serious material loss, but His Majesty&apos;s Government would certainly be accused of bad faith.

Tenability of Colony in face of Chinese hostility

4. Attempts on the part of a hostile China to make our position in Colony untenable might take several forms. As regards open attack (combined or not with other methods) the latest appreciation of the Chiefs of Staff is that the effectiveness of the Chinese Communist Government is not such that, even if the Communists control the whole of China, it could be classed as a major Power and that therefore Hong Kong could be held unless we are engaged in a war with Russia. (The position of Hong Kong in the event of war with Russia involves considerations of general Pacific strategy which, as indicated in paragraph 3 above, are outside the scope of this paper.) As regards methods of coercion other than open attack - e.g., blockade, boycott and instigation of internal unrest - the Governor of Hong Kong has said that these and the measures required to counter them would result in the Colony&apos;s losing all its trade with China and in reduction of its trade with other countries. It is not possible to forecast how long such pressure would be kept up against the Colony, but in the Governor&apos;s opinion with a garrison at the strength to which the recently ordered reinforcements will bring it, we could hold our position indefinitely, though this would involve feeding the population by sea-borne supplies (in such circumstances however much of present swollen Chinese population would probably have left). On a lifting the blockade and boycott and cessation of internal unrest economic recovery would probably be rapid.


(b) The value of a British Hong Kong as a safe, free and efficiently-run port and place of exchange for international trade in the Far East.

Every month about £20,000,000 worth of goods is handled, Hong Kong providing storage, insurance, banking and shipping facilities for this trade. In addition Hong Kong provides at present the only shipbuilding and repair facilities between Singapore and Japan. In 1921, at the peak of its prosperity, entrances and clearances were 43,500,000 gross registered tons (g.r.t.) and after the war these had recovered to 22,000,000 g.r.t. by 1948. The contrast between Shanghai under international control before the war and under Chinese control after it, and the further contrast between Hong Kong and Shanghai after the war point to the loss of security and efficiency and the increase of corruption which are likely to result if Hong Kong were to pass under Chinese control. These results would not only seriously damage international trade, but would cause grievous losses to British commercial interest, by whose exertions and enterprise the Colony has during the pass 100 years been raised to its present position.

(c) The strategic value of Hong Kong

Without entering into discussion of wider questions of general Pacific strategy, certain obvious strategic advantages of Hong Kong may be noted, viz :-

(i) it is a base from which to exert political influence in China;

(ii) it is base from which offensive operations could be conducted in China;

(iii) it is a base which would contribute to control of communications in the China seas; and 

(iv) it has the important negative strategic advantage while in our hands that its harbour and dockyards, valuable for extending the range of naval operations are denied to an enemy.

(d) The expressed or implied undertakings given by His Majesty&apos;s Government since the war that no alteration of the status of the Colony was contemplated (see Annex D).

The confidence with which British firms have gone ahead with rehabilitation and development was undoubtedly based on the ministerial pronouncements in 1944 and 1945 recorded in Annex D. If there were any question of early rendition of the Colony to China not only would such firms suffer serious material loss, but His Majesty&apos;s Government would certainly be accused of bad faith.

Tenability of Colony in face of Chinese hostility

4. Attempts on the part of a hostile China to make our position in Colony untenable might take several forms. As regards open attack (combined or not with other methods) the latest appreciation of the Chiefs of Staff is that the effectiveness of the Chinese Communist Government is not such that, even if the Communists control the whole of China, it could be classed as a major Power and that therefore Hong Kong could be held unless we are engaged in a war with Russia. (The position of Hong Kong in the event of war with Russia involves considerations of general Pacific strategy which, as indicated in paragraph 3 above, are outside the scope of this paper.) As regards methods of coercion other than open attack - e.g., blockade, boycott and instigation of internal unrest - the Governor of Hong Kong has said that these and the measures required to counter them would result in the Colony&apos;s losing all its trade with China and in reduction of its trade with other countries. It is not possible to forecast how long such pressure would be kept up against the Colony, but in the Governor&apos;s opinion with a garrison at the strength to which the recently ordered reinforcements will bring it, we could hold our position indefinitely, though this would involve feeding the population by sea-borne supplies (in such circumstances however much of present swollen Chinese population would probably have left). On a lifting the blockade and boycott and cessation of internal unrest economic recovery would probably be rapid.


ANNEX D

SUMMARY OF ASSURANCES GIVEN BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT SINCE 1942 ABOUT THE FUTURE OF HONG KONG

October, 1942

The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Law), in reply to a question in the House of Commons asking whether the contemplated renunciation of British rights in China included also the transference of Hong Kong back to the Chinese nation, said:-

"No, Sir. The proposed agreement with the Chinese Government relates only to the surrender of extra-territorial rights in Chinese territory."

In answer to a further question whether a good impression would not be created we renounced our position in Hong Kong, Mr. Law replied:-

"That is another problem which has nothing to do with the declaration made in Washington and London the other day."

January 1943

In reply to a further question whether Hong Kong&apos;s status as a Crown Colony had been altered by the agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Republic of China, the Secretary of State for the Colonies replied that it had not.

November, 1944

Mr. Attlee, replying as Lord President of the Council to a question by Mr Astor whether Hong Kong or any other part of the Empire was excluded from Mr Churchill&apos;s declaration that it was not proposed to liquidate the British Empire, said:-

"No part of the British Empire or Commonwealth of Nations was excluded from the scope of the declaration referred to."

Mr. Astor went on to ask whether all encouragement would now be given to British firms to prepare plans for re-establishing themselves in Hong Kong and getting on with British export trade in this area.

Mr. Attlee replied:

"That is obviously so."

May, 1946

In a letter from the Colonial Office, the terms of which were agreed with the Foreign Office and which was sent in reply to a request from the China Association for a reassurance of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s intention to retain Hong Kong, it was pointed out that the reply given by the Foreign Secretary in answer to a question in the House of Commons on 6th March, to the effect that the status of British Colonies would not be altered without consultation with such Colonies and the sanction of the House, included Hong Kong. The letter went on to draw attention to Mr. Attlee&apos;s reply to Mr. Astor on 8th November, 1944 (above), and concluded with a reference to a statement made by Mr. Churchill to the effect that matters affecting British Colonial territory were not to be discussed at the San Francisco Conference or at any other meeting in connexion with that Conference.

August, 1945

Mr. Bevin, in the course of his first speech to the House as Foreign Secretary after referring to the circumstances in which Hong Kong was loss, said:-

"We have now taken steps to receive the surrender of the Japanese forces in Hong Kong. There may still be difficulties, but they will be overcome, and I am sure that in agreement with our Chinese and American Allies our territory will be returned to us"


23rd August, 1945

Arising out of Mr. Bevin&apos;s statement, Mr. Attlee, as Prime Minister, in reply to an arranged private notice question by Mr. Churchill whether His Majesty&apos;s Government were taking action to restore British administration in Hong Kong as soon as they received the Japanese surrender in the Colony, said :-

"Yes, Sir. As stated by the Foreign Secretary on Monday, arrangements are being made for the Japanese surrender in Hong Kong to be accepted by a British Force Commander. Place for re-establishing British administration in the Colony are fully prepared."

Mr. Churchill then went on to ask :-

"While expressing gratification at the answer of the Prime Minister, may I presume that my Right Honourable friend recalls that on numerous occasions, and particularly at the Cairo Conference in 1943 His Majesty&apos;s Government had made it plain that they do not contemplate any modification in the sovereignty of His Majesty&apos;s territories in the Far East?"

The Prime Minister replied :-

"Yes, Sir. I have a very full recollection of those statements and I will bear them in mind."

The Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Hall) in reply to a question by Air Commodore Harvey whether he was in a position to make a statement concerning the future of the New Territories in Hong Kong, replied: " No, Sir."

19th November, 1945

The Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Hall), in reply to a question by Mr. Callaghan as to His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s intention regarding the future administration of Hong Kong, said :-

"A Military Administration has been established in Hong Kong under the Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Harcourt, and the Chief Civil Affairs Officer, and many of his staff are experienced officers of the pre-war civil administration. As soon as conditions in the region permit, it is His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s intention to restore full civil government."

7th July, 1948

In reply to Mr. W. Fletcher, who asked if, in view of the change of naval base from Hong Kong to Singapore, an assurance could be given that no change was contemplated in the status of Hong Kong as a Crown Colony, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Rose-Williams) said :--

"Yes. I would like to add also that there will be no change in the character of Hong Kong as a naval base; as has been recently announced in the press, Hong Kong will remain the operational and training base of the Fleet in the Far East."

10th December, 1948

Replying to observations by Mr. Churchill, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Mayhew) said in the House of Commons:-

"The Right Honourable Gentleman this morning raised several questions outside Europe, one of them Hong Kong, in which he asked for a statement of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. I think there is no need to make any formal or long statement. I will merely state that it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to maintain their position in Hong Kong. We entirely appreciate the importance of Hong Kong as described by the Right Honourable Gentleman. Indeed, we feel that in this particularly troubled situation the value and importance of Hong Kong as a centre of stability will be greater than ever."

3rd February, 1949

The First Lord of the Admiralty (Lord Hall) reiterated in a debate in the House of Lords the statement made by Mr. Mayhew on 10th December, 1948.
