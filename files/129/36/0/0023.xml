HIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.- August 1949SECRET Copy No, 3 ICP. (49) 1738th August, 1949CABINETRETAIL TRADE wages memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service the Wages Councils which have recently been set up for certain branchesof the retail distributive trades have either submitted wages regulation proposals to me or have published proposals which they intend to submit to me. The wages councils in question are the following: Councils which have submitted proposals to me Retail Food (England and Wales).Retail Drapery, Outfitting and Footwear (Great Britain).Hairdressing Undertakings (Great Britain).Retail Bookselling and Stationery (Great Britain).Retail Food (Scotland).Retail Newsagency, Tobacco and Confectionery (Scotland).Milk Distribution (England and Wales).Councils which have advertised proposals but have not yet submitted themto me Retail Newsagency, Tobacco and Confectionery (England and Wales).Retail Furnishing and Allied Trades (Great Britain).2. In Appendix A is a summary of the position on the various proposals,indicating how they have been dealt with so far and showing also the increases in the rates now proposed as compared with current rates fixed by Joint industrial councils (J.I.C.) or otherwise. All the proposals contain minimum rates in excessof those fixed by current J.I.C. agreements, but it will be seen that in most casesthe J.I.C. rates were fixed some time ago. Moreover, we have no certain evidence as to the extent to which these J.I.C. rates are actual current rates; it is possiblethat in many establishments the actual wages being paid are above the agreedrates. All the proposals have been put forward with the agreement of both theemployers&apos; and workers&apos; sides of the respective Wages Councils. Some of them were first submitted to me several months ago; in the case of four of the trades(i.e. Food (England and Wales), Drapery, Outfitting and Footwear (Great Britain),Hairdressing (Great Britain) and Bookselling and Stationery (Great Britain)),I referred the proposals back to the Councils for reconsideration, and in the first two of those cases proposals have been re-submitted to me. I am now being pressed by the trades concerned to confirm the proposals. Before I reach a decision on thisquestion I feel it desirable to obtain the views of my colleagues in view of the repercussions of granting wage increases to such a large section of the retaildistributive trades.3. The proposals of the various Councils are substantially in step with eachother and so long as the rates of wages proposed are not in themselves unreasonable(and I think it would be very difficult to argue that they are) I do not feel thatI could draw a distinction between the various branches of the retail distributive trades as to how I should treat the various proposals.  The decision I take whether37410 &apos; B
tto confirm the proposals or not must, I feel, be applied over the whole field andmust have regard to the general economic position of the country.4. Detailed figures of the number of workers covered by the various wages councils cannot be given. It is estimated that the number employed in retail food, distribution, etc., as a whole in July, 1948, was 678,000, but this figure includesworkers not covered by the Retail Food Wages Council, e.g., those engaged inmeat and milk distribution. The estimated number of workers employed in retail distribution of non-food goods at July, 1948, was 794,00; and this figureagain includes workers (e.g. workers in hardware) not covered by the wages councils with whose proposals this paper is concerned. In the absence of infprma-tion as to actual wages being paid at present, it is difficult to estimate the increased wages cost resulting from the proposals. If, however, the increases now proposed are accorded to all workers in the trades concerned, including those who at presentreceive wages in excess of the J.I.C. rates, and if the whole of the 1,500,000workers in the retail distributive trades referred to above ireceive increasescomparable to those proposed for the trades under consideration, the increase overthe whole field is likely to be between  15 and  20 million per annum.5. When the Retail Food Trades Wages Council (England and Wales)originally submitted their proposals on 14th April, 1949, they were asked to reconsider the wage rates contained in them. On 14th July they re^submitted the same proposals without modification of the wage rates. The establishmentof these new statutory minimum wage rates may be made the occasion by theemployers for pressing still more strongly their existing claim for increasedmargins. It will be remembered that the margins provided by current retailfood prices were not large enough to permit a price cut such as has been effected in the retail prices of utility clothing, footwear and household textiles. If these new wages rates come into force retail food distributors may submit that theywill not be able to absorb them within their present margins. If that be the casethe cost will have to be passed on to the public and will have to be borne in theform either of higher subsidy payments or of increased food prices. It is difficultto estimate the total cost to employers of these proposals, as we do not know the actual rates now being paid. The date and nature of any necessary price- increases and consequently the effect on the Index of Retail Prices cannot beestimated in advance.6. The Retail Drapery, Outfitting and Footwear Trades Wages Council(Great Britain) met on 3rd August to reconsider their wage proposals, whichhad been referred back to them. The workers&apos; side and the independent members were in favour of re-submitting the rates without amendment, but the employers&apos;side asked for more time to consider the effect of the recent 5 per cent, price cut in utility lines. The Council has adjourned for three weeks. If the present proposals are re-submitted and confirmed by me we shall face difficulties in defending the policy of first compulsorily cutting prices and then confirmingincreased wages within a period of a few weeks. The pressure on the Boardof Trade to reverse the recent price cut will certainly be increased. In thisconnection I have received the strongest representations from the President ofthe Board of Trade against the proposals of this Wages Council and, indeed,against any increase in wages in any section of retail distribution at the presenttime. In his view a substantial increase in costs of distribution cannot bewarranted in the present economic situation, increases in wages in retail distribu-tion would be an incitement to workpeople in the manufacturing and other tradesto put in wage claims, the present proposals have no justification in the provisionsof the White Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices, and the proposed increases would be entirely irreconcilable with the Chancellor of the Exchequer^repeated declarations about the crucial importance in the present situation ofpursuing vigorously the Governments policy as set out in that White Paper.7.   There are certain further considerations which I should mention at thispoint: (i) The proposals now made would bring wages in the retail distributive trades above wages in the generality of Wages Councils&apos; trades andmight thus give rise to further claims in respect of other wages councils&apos; trades.(ii) The increased wages now proposed might have the undesirable result of attracting still more of the available supply of workers into the retail
distributive trades; alternatively, if the retailers, as is alleged, would find it impossible to carry the increased wages, these might lead to large-scale dismissals and consequent unemployment of workers in retail distribution.8. The foregoing paragraphs set out the arguments in favour of refusing to confirm the proposals. There are, however, equally strong arguments in favour ofconfirming the proposals.9. Refusal to confirm the unanimous proposals of a Wages Council is a drastic step which, in my view, should be taken only if the national interest sorequires. Wages Councils are the machinery established by Parliament to settleconditions of employment in those trades Or industries where voluntary jointmachinery is either entirely lacking or is not sufficiently strong for the purpose.There is no doubt that Parliament would expect that, in general, the Minister ofLabour would confirm the unanimous proposals of a Wages Council. Moreover,to refuse to confirm might well deal a serious blow at the authority of the statutorywage-regulating machinery as a whole and might impair public confidence in that machinery. Worse still, we should be bringing the Government into the contrb-versial field where actual rates of wages are fixed, a situation which we have always been at pains to avoid. Against this it must be admitted that, if it was intended that all proposals submitted by Wages Councils should be automaticallyapplied, it is.difficult to see why Parliament should have brought the Minister ofLabour into trie matter at all; and, indeed, as my colleagues will be aware from this paper, I not infrequently refer proposals back to the Wages Councils both on questions of wages and on other matters.lOv As regards the merits of the various proposals, Appendix B is a state-ment showing the rates proposed By the different Wages Councils and now underconsideration. It will be seen that, with the exception of Retail Bookselling andStationery, none of the rates for men outside London exceed  5 a week. The ratesfor men shop assistants in the food trades in London are 92s. at age 21, rising to102s. at age 24, and for men &quot; other workers &quot; 90s. at age 21, rising to 96s. at&apos;age 24. In the case of the drapery trades the London rates for men shop assistantsare 93s. at age 21, rising to 104s. at age 24, and for men &quot; other workers &quot;90s. stage 21, rising to 96s. at age 24. I do not regard any of the proposals as providingexcessive wages for the workers in question and the present J.I.C. rates were inmost cases settled two years ago. The observations of the President of the Boardof Trade, to which I have referred iii paragraph 6, need, I feel, to be weighed against the background of these considerations. For myself I could not subscribe to the view that the. increased costs of distribution consequent upon the acceptanceof these proposals would be unreasonable; and I cannot agree that the increases proposed are in conflict with the principles set out in the White Paper on personal incomes, Costs and Prices. Accordingly I feel that a refusal to confirm the pro-posals on the general economic grounds I have mentioned above would be regardedas discrimination against a particular group of workers.11. I have discussed these problems with representatives of the T.U.C. Theyhave informed me that in their view confirmation of the proposed increases wouldnot prejudice their policy aimed at achieving stability in the wages field.&quot; Thispolicy has always envisaged scope f pr increases in wages below a reasonable level(as did the White Paper) and it is clear from my discussion that the T.U.C. would feel that existing wages in the retail distributive trades are in that category andthat the proposed increases would hot conflict with the principles of the white paper. The representatives of the T.U.C. expressed the opinion in fact that, irrdefending, at Congress at Bridlington in September, the Government^ policy andtheir own support of it, they would be more embarrassed if I refused to confirmthese proposals than if I did confirm them.12. Whichever course we adopt will cause difficulty and will no doubt be severely criticised. Considerations of fairness are, in my view, in favour of con-firmation, and after weighing carefully the general economic arguments I am satisfied that I ought to confirm the proposals, subject to any modifications whichthe Councils concerned may suggest in those proposals which have been referred back to them.G.

The J.I.C. has not negotiated wage rates since the Award of the national arbitration Tribunal in 1944, which fixed the following rates: London Provincial A Provincial B   . .Shop Assistants-                    s. d.            s. d, s. d.Men    ...      ...      ...      76   0 73  0 71   women ... 51   0 48   0 46   0(5) Retail Food Trades Wages Council (Scotland)10th May, 1949 : Proposals advertised by Council.30th June, 1949 : Proposals submitted for the making of wagesregulation orders.The proposed rates, which are the same for shop assistants and &apos;&apos; other workers,&quot; are higher for men by 5s. and 7s. per week and for women by 5s.and 3s. per week than those in the National A greement for the Scottish Groceryand Provisions Trades of September 1947.It is proposed to refer these proposals back to the Council for reconsideration of the proposed rates, which are higher at the age of 24 years than those proposed for similar workers by the Retail Food Trades Wages Council (England andWales).(6) Retail Newsagency, Tobacco and Confectionery Trades Wages Council(Scotland)10th May, 1949: Proposals advertised by Council.30th June, 1949: Proposals submitted for the making of wages regu-lation orders.The proposed rates, which are the same for shop assistants and &quot; other workers,&quot; are at about the same level as the rates proposed for shop assistants bythe Retail Food Trades Wages Council (England and Wales) but the latterCouncil proposes lower rates for &quot;other workers.&quot;There is no information as to the rates actually being paid beyond the award of the National Arbitration Tribunal in April 1948 of 66s. per week to certainfemale shop assistants in the Scottish Retail Confectionery Trade. The proposedrates for women in areas of (roughly) 10,000 population are 68s. per week and,in smaller areas, 64s. per week.B. The following Wages Councils in the Retail Distributive Trades haveadvertised proposals but have not yet submitted them for the making ofwages regulation orders: (1) Retail Newsagency, Tobacco and Confectionery Wages Council (Englandand Wales); and the(2) Retail Furnishing and Allied Trades Wages Council (Great Britain).C. The following Wages Council, which operates in relation to certain shop assistants, has submitted proposals for the making of a wages regulationorder : Milk Distributive Wages Council (England and Wales)17th June, 1949 : Proposals advertised by Council.5th July, 1949 : Proposals submitted for making of a wages regulationorder.This Council is not one of those recently established in the retail trades. Itwas formerly a Trade Board and wages have consequently been regulated for manyyears. The Wages Council fixes rates for those shop assistants who fall within its scope and it has now submitted proposals for increases for all workers, amountingin the case of adult males to 4s. per week and in the case of adult females to 3s.per week. These increases if made effective would yield to shop assistants weeklyrates as follows : Area A, Area B.
