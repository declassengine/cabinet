DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENT&quot;T-236Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1949CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 3JCP. (49) 18224 A August, 1949CABINETINTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE-GENEVA,JUNE-JULY 1949Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service the 32nd Session of the International Labour Conference was held at Genevafrom 8th June to 2nd July, inclusive. The Governing Body met on 3rd and4th June, but as it did not complete its work on these dates a number of meetingshad to be held during the Conference.The Minister of Labour&apos;s Address to the conference Owing to the industrial troubles at home I was, unfortunately, able to spend only two days at this year&apos;s Conference. The Parliamentary Secretaryalso attended for a short time. While I was there I addressed the Conferencejust before the Director-General replied to the discussion on his report. Myspeech, which was very well received, is appended as an Annex to thismemorandum.President and Vice-Presidents3. It was, I know, a source of great satisfaction to my colleagues that, onthe proposal of the Brazilian Government, Sir Guildhaume Myrddin-Evans,Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, was unanimously elected President of the Conference. This is the first time since1926 that the Conference has had a President from the United Kingdom and thefirst time in the history of the I.L.O. that a serving civil servant of any country has been elected President. It is,T feel, not only a recognition of the firm support which this country has consistently given to the I.L.O. since its foundation, but is also an outstanding tribute, of which we can be justly proud, to the british civil Service.4. The Vice-Presidents of the Conference were M. Pierre Dupong, PrimeMinister and Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, Luxembourg (Government),M. Pierre Waline, France (Employer) and M. Ibanez Aguila, Chile (Worker).The Chairmanships of the various committees were distributed broadly on ageographical basis.General5. Delegations from 50 States Members attended the Conference. Inaddition there was a tripartite observer delegation from Japan, who were accompanied by a representative of the Supreme Commander for the AlliedPowers. A proposal put by the British Government to the Governing Body thata tripartite delegation from Germany should also be invited to attend theConference in the role of observers, was supported by the Governments of theUnited States, France and other countries and unanimously by the employers&apos;and workers&apos; groups. Some Western European countries, however, particularlyBelgium, whose Prime Minister, M. Spaak, was at that time being attacked both from the Right and from the Left as being too friendly to Germany, regarded the proposal as premature and it was not pursued. This matter is referred to37489 B
later in paragraph 22. Representatives were present from the United nations and the Specialised Agencies. In addition a number of non-governmental organisations, including the World Federation of Trade Unions, sentrepresentatives.6. In the three and a half weeks available the Conference accomplished agreat volume of exceedingly useful work in the field of international labourlegislation. The spirit of co-operation which I noted in connection with lastyear&apos;s Conference was again in evidence and there was a general desire to reach agreement on instruments which would be regarded as widely acceptable andwhich were not merely the embodiment of distant ideals. United KingdomGovernment delegates to International Labour Conferences have for many yearsconsistently pressed the view that International Labour Conventions, and to asubstantial extent Recommendations as well, should be regarded not merely asdeclarations of ideals but as practicable instruments capable of reasonably rapid and widespread implementation. This line has been supported both by the UnitedKingdom employers&apos; and by the United Kingdom workers&apos; delegates, and thereare signs that our views are making a substantial and increasing impression upon other delegates, with the result that, as noted in my report on last year&apos;s Session,the instruments adopted by the International Labour Conference in recent years are tending to be more realistic than formerly. A notable example of the greaterrealism now being displayed by the Conference is the way in which theyapproached this year the question of the revision of the Convention on Fee-Charging Employment Agencies. This Convention, which was passed in 1933,provided for the abolition of Fee-Charging Employment Agencies. In the courseof sixteen years it has attracted ratification from only six States. When revisingit this year, accordingly, the Conference reconstructed it and included provisionfor the alternative policies of abolition or regulation of such agencies either ofwhich could be adopted by a ratifying State. It was further provided that aratifying State which chose to ratify on the basis of the regulation of agenciesmight subsequently adopt abolition, but that a State which once adopted abolitionmight not, within the terms of the Convention, go back and adopt regulation.My colleagues will recall that on 14th January (L.P. (49) 1st Meeting, Minute 2)the Lord Presidents Committee agreed that the United Kingdom Governmentshould support the policy of regulation. Despite the opposition of the Frenchand Belgian Governments the Convention was adopted by the Conference in itsrevised form by an overwhelming majority and with the strong support of theworkers&apos; group.7. The United Kingdom Delegation Government, Employers and workers played its usual leading part in the Conference and the results are,except for one or two details, acceptable and in accordance with the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government. The United Kingdom Government Delegation againreceived the most wholehearted co-operation from the British employers&apos; and workers&apos; representatives, led as last year by Sir John Forbes Watson andMr. Alfred Roberts respectively, although naturally these representatives didnot always vote the same way as the Government delegates. I wish again toexpress my gratitude to those of my colleagues whose officers formed part of theGovernment Delegation. The high quality of this representation was largelyresponsible for the generally favourable result (from the British point of view)of the proceedings and envious tributes to our team were to be heard from all quarters. Foreign representation was well up to standard without, however,any particularly outstanding personality disclosing himself in either of the three groups.8. The Conference on the whole passed off quietly. The exchanges inPlenary Session were not, however, without a certain acerbity. Thus, the repre-sentatives of the &quot; Iron Curtain&quot; countries (Poland, Czechoslovakia, bulgaria and Hungary) made a series of what were obviously planned and- concertedattacks on the policies of some countries, the conditions in other countries, the alleged under-representation of workers in the composition of national delega-tions to the International Labour Conference, and other matters. These attacks,while pungent in form, lacked a certain conviction and reality in expression.Nevertheless, by acting as a &quot;team&quot; and by cleverly spreading their speakersover the whole of the two weeks&apos; discussion on the Director-General&apos;s report, therepresentatives of the &quot; Iron Curtain&quot; countries were able both to launch attacks
from different quarters and on different countries and also to reply to counterattacks or replies by other delegates which had been evoked by earlier attacksfrom other members of the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; team. In this way they werecollectively enabled to overcome the disability from which the ordinary delegatesuffers by not being able to speak more than once. A striking example of this occurred when the United States employers&apos; delegate, ill-advisedly as most dele-cates thought, stated in answer to earlier speeches from some of the &quot;iron curtain &quot; representatives-&apos;&apos;  to our friends across the iron curtain we must, and I am sure we will,be prepared on a moment&apos;s notice to defend, with arms if necessary, thefreedom and the liberties of the Old World that we and our forefathershave loved and fought for.&quot;As might have been expected, this brought forth from M. Levcik, one of the czechoslovak Government delegates, a devastating reply which was all the more effective for being very restrained.9. Generally there was rather more of a tendency than has previously beenthe case to use the platform of the Conference for the purpose of makingpolitical declarations. Thus, there were some controversial exchanges betweenthe Dutch workers&apos; delegate and one of the Dutch Government delegates aboutthe action of the Roman Catholic Church in prohibiting Catholics from belongingto the general Dutch trade union movement (the Netherlands Federation of TradeUnions); the Government delegate from the Philippines attacked what he called the &quot; White Australia &quot; policy; the Minister of Industry and Commerce of theIrish Republic made a reference to the partition question; and the argentine government delegate protested once more against the description of the falkland islands as a British possession. There was no sting, however, in this lastincident and the Argentine delegate in friendly fashion informed us in advance that he was going to do this so that we might not be taken unawares and could make our answering protest which we duly did with firmness and brevity.10. This tendency to bring controversial issues to the platform of the Inter-national Labour Conference, which happily has hitherto been reasonably free from such incidents, is a development which can only be deplored. I referred toit with deep concern in my address, and at the same time I pointed out in replyto the Minister of Industry and Commerce of the Irish Republic that the boundary between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic exists because of the clear desire for it expressed at successive Parliamentary elections by the people of -Northern Ireland.Co-operation with other Commonwealth Representatives11. We maintained our usual close contact with the other Commonwealthdelegates and advisers, including the sole delegate from Ceylon, which was repre-sented for the first time since obtaining membership last year. They were allmost anxious to co-operate and our relations were of the happiest, although theAustralian delegation sometimes took an awkward line a not unusual occurrencein international meetings.The Director-General12. This was the first Conference since Mr. Morse took office as Director-General last September and he can be well satisfied both with the results achievedand with his own standing in the Organisation. He confirmed earlier impressionsas to his sincerity and ability. He has been himself receptive to new ideas andat the same time realistic in his approach to a consideration of their practicability.He should prove a very successful executive head of the Organisation.The Agenda of the Annual Conference13. In common with other organisations, the I.L.O. is faced with anaccumulation of urgent questions which interested parties or States press uponthe attention of the Conference. The result is that the agenda, although stillmodest when compared with those of some other international organisations, istending to make demands upon Governments, employers and workers in the wayof representation which all parties are finding it increasingly difficult to meet.
Speaker after speaker referred to this question during the discussion on theDirector-GeneraPs report, calling attention, among other disadvantages, to thefact that an unmanageably heavy agenda could only lead to inefficient work and unacceptable conclusions. The &apos; International Labour Conference is generallyscheduled to last 3^ weeks and the time allotted is strictly adhered to. A heavieragenda could only be undertaken if more time is allotted to the Conference whichis both difficult and expensive or by an increase in the size of delegations which,besides being expensive, would be impossible for many States. The matter isengaging the attention of the Governing Body, but the Government members ofthe Governing Body will need to act with great firmness and restraint if, againstthe increasing pressure from all parties to add items to the agenda,, they are to succeed in keeping the agenda within manageable limits.The Work of the 1949 Session of the Conference14. I shall be communicating to my colleagues in due course the usual white paper containing the detailed account of the proceedings of the Conference. Inaddition I shall submit to them my proposals regarding the action to be taken on the various measures adopted by the Conference. In the meantime I appendthe following brief notes on some of the principal subjects discussed.Finance15. The Conference adopted the expenditure Budget for 1950 at$5,983,526 as compared with $5,185,539 in 1949. The figure for 1950 is nothigh compared with the essential work which has to be done, particularly whenrising prices and automatic salary increases are taken into account, and it shouldbe noted that the discussions in the Governing Body resulted, mainly on proposals made by the British Government representatives, in reductions of approximately$650,000 on the estimate presented by the Director-General. After allowing forthe balances available from previous years, the amount to be provided by contri-butions from member States in 1950 is $5,725,697, of which the United kingdom share is $719,241. The I.L.O. has not yet adopted a permanent post-war scale of contributions. The general inclination of most members is in favour of theadoption of the United Nations scale when that is finally established, although there is a strong feeling in some quarters against a per capita adjustment basedon population. The United States are resisting the early adoption of the united nations scale since they will not in any circumstances agree to pay to the specialised Agencies on the same scale as they pay to the United Nations(39-89 per cent.). It will indeed be difficult to persuade them to go above25 per cent., and there are at present ceilings fixed by Congress on the amounts which may be contributed to the I.L.O., the World Health Organisation and theFood and Agricultural Organisation, which in the case of the I.L.O. would not permit them even to approach 25 per cent. In the meantime some relief will be afforded to other members of the I.L.O. in 1950 by the decision to raise the UnitedStates contribution from approximately 18 per cent, to 22 per cent., but even this latter percentage will bring the United States contribution substantially above the existing ceiling fixed by Congress, which the latter are being askedto remove.Industrial Relations16. In supplementation of the Convention on Freedom of Associationadopted at San Francisco last year, the Conference adopted a Convention onthe Application of the Principles of the Right.to Organise and to BargainCollectively. This is a short but important convention. It is designed to pro-tect workers against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employ-ment and provides other guarantees designed to protect the right to organiseinto trade unions and employers&apos; organisations. Further, it provides, amongst other things, for encouraging and promoting the full development and utilisation-tion of machinery for voluntary negotiation. The Convention was agreed only after long, hard and patient negotiations. There were some votes cast against it, including that of the British employers&apos; delegate. It represents a furtheiimportant advance on the international plane towards the aim of freedom of association. Its provisions are acceptable to the British Government and, sub-ject to examination of details, I think we shall be able to ratify it with theinclusion of Northern Ireland.
Wages17.   Building on the foundations laid last year, the Conference (1) adopted a Convention and a Recommendation on labour clauses in publiccontracts. The provisions of the Convention are broadly on the linesof our fair wages clause and we should be able to ratify the Conven-tion. The Recommendation is unacceptable because it provides thatactual rates of wages and details of other conditions of employmentshall in certain circumstances be written into the contract:(2) adopted a Convention and a Recommendation on the protection of wages.These instruments contain a series of safeguards relating to thepayment of wages which are based, to a considerable extent, on theprovisions of the Truck Acts. The British Government delegates were able to vote for both the Convention and the Recommendation.Migration for Employment18. Following upon much preparatory work carried out by the InternationalLabour Office and by the Permanent Migration Committee of the governing body, the Conference revised the 1939 Convention on this subject, which hadbeen ratified by no single State. The main purpose of this Convention is theprotection of the migrant, a matter of particular importance at the presenttime in view of the contribution which migration can make to the redistribution of the world&apos;s manpower and to a proper development of the economic resourcesof different countries, especially those which are under-developed. The 1939Convention failed to attract ratifications largely because it went into too great detail, much of which was unacceptable to one or more of the receiving countries.The revised Convention also goes into detail, but the body of the convention is largely confined to general principles, the detailed measures being relegatedto three Annexes, and it is provided that any State can ratify the Conventionwith or without all or any of the Annexes. This is a novel feature of I.L.O.Conventions and, like the question of Fee Charging Employment Agenciesreferred to above, is an example of the Conference^ new and more realisticapproach to the difficult problem of drawing up international instruments whichwill help rather than hinder progress in the social field. The Conference alsoadopted a Recommendation, to which was annexed a draft Model agreement on temporary and permanent migration for employment, including migrationof refugees and displaced workers. The subject of migration, incidentally, isan outstanding example of co-operation between the United Nations and the specialised Agencies; agreement has been reached as to their respectiveresponsibilities in regard to this question and, under this agreement, the I.L.O.takes the lead over a considerable area of the field.Other Instruments19. (1) The Conference, with a view to removing obstacles in the way of ratification, revised three of the Maritime Conventions adopted at Seattle in1946, dealing respectively with holidays with pay, crew accommodation and wages and hours of work.(2) The Conference adopted a detailed Recommendation on vocational guidance.(3) Reference has already been made in paragraph 6 above to the revision,of the Fee Charging Employment Agencies Convention.Technical Assistance for Under-Developed Countries20. This matter was discussed at length both in the Governing Body and inthe Conference, and a resolution was adopted by the Conference authorising the Governing Body to make, as necessary, interim arrangements to initiatean expanded technical assistance programme as part of the co-operative pro-gramme contemplated by the Economic and Social Council, pending the submission of more detailed proposals to the 1950 Session of the Conference.Resolutions21. A number of other resolutions were brought before the Conference,which adopted two of them.

A number of other resolutions were brought before the Conference,which adopted two of them. One of these requested the Governing Body toconsider giving instructions for the preparation of a comprehensive report on
the problem of unemployment and to consider the desirability of placing thequestion of unemployment on the agenda of an early session of the Conference;the other requested the Governing Body to instruct the international LabourOffice to prepare reports on the law and practice of States Members governingannual holidays with pay and on physical and cultural recreational facilities for workers.Relations with Germany22. In paragraph 5 above I mentioned the attempt made by the BritishGovernment member of the Governing Body to have Germany invited to theConference in the role of observers and tb the fact that against the reluctance of some Western European countries (amounting in the case of Belgium to opposition) this proposal was not pursued. The desirability of associatingGermany as soon as possible with the work of the I.L.O. was, however, admittedand as the result of considerable discussion the following resolution was foundto be generally acceptable and was passed by the Governing Body on 1st Julyagainst the opposition of the Czechoslovak Government and with the abstentionof the Australian and Chinese Governments :-&quot; The Governing Body (i) takes account of the steps already taken by the Office with a view to establishing regular contact and exchange of information withGermany;(ii) emphasises the desirability of bringing German representatives into closer association with the work of the Orgianisatiop;(iii) instructs the Director-General, in consultation with the officers of theGoverning Body, to take all appropriate steps, consistent with theconstitution and practice of the I.L.O., to associate representatives from Germany, including representatives of employers and workers,with those meetings and activities of the Organisation in 1949-50which are of interest and concern to Germany.&quot;It is expected that, following on the resolution, tripartite delegations fromGermany will be present as observers at many I.L.O. meetings during the coming year.G. A. I.Ministry of Labour and National Service^ S.W. 1.,24th August, 1949.ANNEXSpeech by the Minister of Labour and National Service to the InternationalLabour Conference, June 1949When I had the pleasure of addressing the Conference last year, I referredto two events which I felt made that year one of particular significance in thehistory of the International Labour Organisation. The revised Constitution had come into force, and the new Director-General had been elected by the governing body.While it is early yet to attempt to gauge the full effects of the new Constitu-tion, it is clear that, in his first year of office, the new Director-General has lefthis characteristic imprint upon the Organisation^ work.The Report which is before you presents a most illuminating picture of theworld in which we live tp-day. It is a picture of a world still striving to overcome the material and moral effects of nearly six years of a devastating world war.It is a record of determination and of considerable achievement; it reveals,nonetheless, many underlying dislocations and tensions and numerous problems which vary in their nature, in their impact and in their urgency between thedifferent countries and the different regions of the world.In the introduction to his Report, the Director-General shows that he has given close thought to the place of the Organisation in this highly complicated
and rapidly developing world situation. Before, however, I turn to this subject,perhaps I may pause for a moment to say a few words on the position of my own country in relation to some of the problems to which the Director-General hasdrawn attention. .Economically, the year 1948 was for us a year of steady progress. We were successful in improving our general balance of payments position, and, althoughour labour force increased by only 2 per cent., industrial production as a wholerose by about 12 per. cent, above the 1947 level. At the present time the numberof persons in civil employment in Great Britain stands at almost the highestpoint ever recorded. These include a large number of workers from othercountries whose help we have appreciated. The figures of unemployment represent only 1  per cent, of the total number of insured workers and Unemploymentcontinues to go down. The demobilisation of the wartime armed forces lias beencompleted.It is now likely that the civilian working population will remain at about itspresent level, and that the present pattern of employment will become stabilised subject, of course, to the normal changes that necessarily occur in an economy which is adaptable and alert. With this relatively stable labour force Our presentobjective is to improve still further our productivity while maintaining our financial stability.  Our primary aim is to solve the problem of our dollar deficit.We have received most timely assistance from the United States under theEuropean Recovery Programme and in the form of credits from Canada. this assistance is temporary and we are determined to stand on our own feet as quickly as possible. We are working in close co-operation with the commonwealth countries. We are also working closely with other European countries throughthe Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, which is based upon aconception of a common effort to solve common problems.   ,In fact, British recovery is Only part of an almost world-wide problem andour tasks must be seen in the framework of international effort in many fields. Itis for this reason that I welcome the comprehensive survey contained in the Report&apos;before the Conference.No praise is too high for the work of the International Labour organisation in its efforts to establish fair standards of living and to improve conditions oflabour in all countries. But I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the increasing attention given by the International Labour Organisation tothe efforts of Member States to promote improvements in the,material and social conditions of the people in non-metropolitan territories. This interest is reflected in the report of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions.His Majesty&apos;s Government are deeply sensible of their obligations, not onlyin regard to the provision of information on the application of Conventions to non-metropolitan territories, but also to ensure that the necessary labour and inspection services are available to secure the effective implementation of thesocial legislation enacted by colonial Governments.Since the war progress has been made in building up colonial labour depart-ments. In all but the very smallest territories there are now very active labourdepartments which have done and are doing a great deal towards securingimproved working conditions and fostering the growth of good relations between employers and workers.While I am on the subject of non-metropolitan territories, there is one particular point I must make. I regret that, in discussing the question of remuneration in colonial territories, the Director-General should have placed somuch emphasis on and should have attached so much credence to certain state-ments by the Trusteeship Council Visiting Mission to Tanganyika. Leaving asideany question of fairness and impartiality on which this Organisation has alwaysprided itself, I am sure that on reflection the Director-General will agree with me that in the long run it will do the Organisation little service for it to publish,with complete approval and without awaiting the comments of the party criticised,allegations which the I.L.O. itself has had no opportunity to check and whichthe authority attacked has been given no opportunity to answer.It is therefore necessary for me to say here, for the purposes of record, thatthe comments of the administrative authority, which wez^e communicated to theSecretary-General on 10th May and released to the press on the following day,and therefore were not available when the Director-General signed his report,show that the observations of the Visiting Mission are open to question on several important points.
I would like now to turn to some of the ideas which the Director-General has expressed on the future development of the Organisation^ work, ideas whichhave, to some extent, already been translated into action in the course of the past year. This year has seen a new and growing emphasis upon the operationalfunctions of the Organisation.My Government welcomes this development, believing that in the rapidlyevolving world in which we live to-day there is a real need to assemble and provide for those who need it most the fullest information and the best availableadvice and assistance on their current practical problems. This year has, in fact,seen the development of the Organisation^ operational work in Europe, theFar East and, more recently, in Latin America. I feel that it was most happilysymbolic of our time that it should have fallen to the lot of a representative ofthe great Asian country of India to open, as Chairman of the Governing Body,the recent Conference of American States Members of the Organisation.The conception of promoting a truly world-wide application of the Organisa-tion&apos;s influence through the decentralisation of its activities is not, of course, anew one. The system of regional conferences, for instance, has its origin in thepre-war years. This showed an appreciation of the fact that, although the idealsof the Organisation were common ideals, they had to be considered in a numberof special contexts if they were to result in world standards based on the greatestmeasure of common agreement.So with the evolution of the Organisation^ operational work, the particular problems of different regions and different countries must be closely studied if theprogramme as a whole is to embody a realistic appreciation of practicalrequirements.My Government particularly welcomes the reference by the Director-general to the relationship between these new developments and the I.L.O. the operational work of the Organisation should, in fact, be regarded as the comple-ment of the functions of the Conference as a deliberative and legislative assembly.The provision of technical advice and assistance should not only make assured the practical implementation of international standards, but should also resultin the progressive improvement of those standards. Before I leave this subjectthere are two further points I would like to submit.First, I should like to express my Government^ appreciation of the initiativetaken by the President of the United States to promote an expanded programmeof technical assistance for economic development through the United nations and the specialised agencies. The views of the International Labour organisation on the relationship between economic and social development are well known and long established, for they are embodied in the Constitution and in the Declarationof Philadelphia. I am sure that this Organisation has an important contributionto make to the development of this far-reaching scheme, and I hope that it will-operate to the full in those fields which fall within its competence.Secondly, I should like to stress that not only must co-operation with other international agencies be developed and strengthened, as the Director-Generalrightly says, but that we must all, as States Members of the International LabourOrganisation, co-operate actively with the Organisation and with each other. AsI see it, an international organisation such as this can only help individual countries to help themselves. It cannot do the work for us. Perhaps I may beallowed to illustrate this by reference to the problem of migration for employ-ment which is on the agenda of the present Conference. While the Conferencemay adopt international regulations, and while the Organisation may arrangespecial conferences to discuss practical migration problems, the ordered develop-ment of migration can, in the last resort, only be effected upon the basis of concreteplans and agreements worked out between the countries concerned.I would like now to turn for a few minutes to some of the items onthe agenda of the present Conference. I have briefly referred to the subject of migration for employment, and I feel that it is peculiarly apposite that the revisionof the current regulations should fall for discussion this year. The developmentof migration is of the first importance if the world&apos;s man-power is to be fullyutilised, and it is, therefore, all the more essential that migrants should be assured of all proper safeguards. I would, however, like to suggest that the problems with which we are faced are detailed and complex. Not all may be suited to international regulation. In the case of some, provisions which might be suitablefor one category of migrant might not necessarily be applicable to others. my government feel that it is essential that the regulations adopted by the Conference
should be such as to permit the widest possible acceptance arid implementation.They shbuid, while sacrificing no essential safeguards, be drawn tip in a formsufficiently flexible to permit, in the iritereSts of the inigrahts themselves, the widestmeasure of cbriimoh agreement.The question of vocational guidance is one which is closely linked to lastyear&apos;s disctissidns on the orgariisatiori of the employment service. The formula-tibri of international regulations ori these two subjects well illustrates the truththat the iriihimum standards established by the Cbiifferehce arid the Organisation&apos;sOperational Work should complement each other. It also illustrates the necessityof integrating national and international efforts in the inah-power field. It is hardly possible tb exaggerate the importance Of ari adequate employment exchangeservice as; the foundation of national scheines to secure the effective distributionof hian-power. so  also; a system of vocational guidance properly corieeived and organised should secure that talents arid capabilities are fully utilised in theinterests1 both,of the individual worker arid of the community at large.The Corifererice sets the standards; it is for the&apos; individual countries-aidedand advised if need be by the Organisation itself-tb impleiuerit those standards.I am glad to be able to announce that my Gbverniheht proposes to ratify theConvention adopted last year concerning the orgaiiisatiori of the employment service; It also proposes to accept (with one reservation) the associatedRecommendation.Last year the Conference adopted another Convention which may properly be regarded as one of the most important in the history of the Organisation.I refer to the Convention on freedom of association arid the protection of the rightto organise. It was indeed an impressive achievement that the Conference was able to adopt without a dissentient vote a Convention on a subject of suchdifficulty and complexity. The principles dealt with in this Convention lie atthe very root of the Organisation^ work. May I express the hope that thisConvention will be widely ratified and that all States Members will co-operateiri providing the Director-General and the Governing Body with the fullest possible information on their law and practice in regard to the matters covered bythe Convention;So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the Conference is alreadyaware that my Government has announced its intention to ratify this convention in respect of Great Britain where the law and practice are fully in accord with the Convention^ requirements. The instrument of ratification has nowbeen deposited and was received by the Director-General this morning.The work which was begun last year at San Fraricisco with the adoptionof this Convention is being continued this year with the consideration of a proposed Convention on the application of the principles of the right to organiseand to bargain collectively and with a first discussion on industrial relations.This constitutes an impressive programme of international legislation on matters which during the last years have been the centre of much attention, and even of controversy. Particularly on matters such as these, international regulations to be effective must be such as are capable of widespread acceptance andimplementation. I therefore sincerely nope that this year and at the nextConference it will be possible to secure the wide measure of agreement which was obtained at San Fraricisco.As a lifelong trade unionist, and with a family history of active participa-tion in the trade union moveriient df my country, I can speak with knowledge andfeeling of the fundamental value to the workers of the positive rights of associa-tion and collective organisation. In some countries, these rights have only been assured after many bitter struggles. It is how for us to do all we can to assurethese basic rights to alb It may be that iri certain countries, particularly iiithose with a long history of collective organisation, the full exercise of freedomof association and the right to organise may in its turn have raised other problems of its own.My Government considers that such matters are the proper responsibilityof ^ the two sides of each individual industry. It does not consider that they are suitable for national or international regulation. I would urge that the Confer-ence should not be diverted from the task of ensuring to all those positive rightsof association which are the basis of sound relations between employers and workers.37489 c
This year has been marked by close co-operation between the InternationalLabour Organisation and the United Nations on a number of matters of impor-tance and mutual interest. I only intend to refer to one which, although not onthe agenda of the present Conference, is an integral part of freedom of associa-tion, the right to organise and the development of sound industrial relationsgenerally. I refer to the question of the protection of trade union rights.Allegations have been made that, in various parts of the world, trade unionrights are being infringed, and this is a problem which, during the past year,has engaged the particular attention both of the United Nations and of theInternational Labour Organisation. It is a problem to which part at least ofthe answer is the widespread ratification and implementation of the convention on freedom of association. The problem, however, lies deeper than the ratifioa-tion of Conventions, important though that is, or indeed than any formal action under the terms of the Constitution of the I.L.O. I would like to stress the needfor finding means to ensure that allegations of the infringement of trade unionrights can be examined upon the international plane authoritatively, impartiallyand without bias, and at the same time consistently with national sovereignty.The International Labour Organisation in particular should, in matters ofthis kind, properly reflect the common conscience of its Members, arising from theobligations which they have in common freely accepted. How can this moralinfluence be brought to bear where necessary without improper interference inthe domestic affairs of individual States ?The whole problem of trade union rights, their protection and enforcementis, in fact, one in which this tripartite Organisation has special interests and special responsibilities. It is a problem regarding which the eyes of the worldturn naturally to the International Labour Organisation, and I therefore feelthat no apology is needed for drawing the attention of the Conference to aquestion which, in the months and years to come, will call for the exercise ofclear thought and practical statesmanship.Before I conclude there are two matters bearing on the future work of this organisation to which I should like to refer quite shortly. In the course of the debate, a number of speakers have expressed misgivings at the increasing weightof the agenda of the annual Conference and at the potentially bad effect this development may have upon the quality of the work performed. I understandthat this question has been referred by the Governing Body to its officers for examination and report, and I would not at this stage, therefore, wish to express a view in one direction or the other. But I would say that this is a matter ofthe highest importance for the future effectiveness of the work of the Organisa-tion. There are many important problems waiting to be dealt with by inter-national regulation, and I appreciate to the full the need to deal with thesematters with the utmost urgency. Nevertheless, in the field of legislation, withwhich the Conference is mainly concerned, quality is of greater importance thanquantity, and it is better to build well and soundly than merely to build quickly.Both the speeches at the present session and the record of the Conference in thelast few years indicate, I think, your support for this view. In the field ofConventions and Recommendations we need above all instruments which willcommand general acceptance, general ratification and, most important of all,general implementation. It may well be that we shall have to give more attention,in planning our legislative programme, to questions of priority in order to allow ourselves time to draw up instruments which will fulfil the objectives I have mentioned.The second matter is one of perhaps even greater importance. But before i come to the main issue, I want just to refer to the remarks made on 21st Juneby the representative of the Irish Republic about the boundary between his country and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Iwas very sorry to read those remarks and I must point out that the boundaryin question exists because of the clear desire for it expressed at successiveParliamentary elections by the people of Northern Ireland. I could say muchmore on this topic. Let me return, however, to the more general question whichI want to bring to your attention. I have noticed in recent meetings of theOrganisation (not confined to sessions of the Conference) the beginnings of atendency to import into this Organisation a practice which has grown up in other organisations of using these debates for purposes of political propaganda and,in some cases, for the making of bitter attacks upon fellow Members of the
Organisation. I cannot find words sufficiently strong in which to condemn this tendency. It is a legitimate exercise of the rights of this platform for repre-sentatives to present an account of the conditions in their countries and toemphasise the favourable aspects of those conditions. We could wish that someof the tales of freedom and advanced social conditions which we have heard from this rostrum tallied more closely with the observations of impartial visitors to, and the accounts of some of the refugees from, some of the countries concerned.We have no desire to stifle debate, for in common with other Western democracieswe believe in freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of speech,as anyone may find who wishes to visit our country, to which he may freely come.But the tendency which I have noticed goes far beyond these legitimate usesof this platform. At present, as I have said, it is in its early stages so faras the I.L.O. is concerned. But, if it is allowed to continue, the atmosphere willbecome poisoned, our debates will be sterile, our attention, which should be givento other matters, will be diverted into paths of mutual recrimination, our workwill be stultified, and we shall suffer from a sense of frustration and bitternesswhich may well mean the end of the Organisation^ usefulness as a force for social progress. With all the strength at my command I would urge upon allrepresentatives that we should stop this pernicious practice at the very beginning.It has not been possible within the time at my disposal to do more thantouch upon a few outstanding issues which face us to-day. May I concludeby reaffirming the faith of my Government in the ideals of the Organisation andin its capacity to demonstrate to the world the practical efficiency of international co--operation? As the International Labour Organisation moves forward to itsdestiny we wish it God-speed and pledge it our continued support.
