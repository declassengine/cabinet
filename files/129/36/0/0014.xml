*a . m[IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (49) 164 COPY NO. 3/25TH JULY. 1949CABINETDEPORTATION OP BRITISH SUBJECTS PROM THE UNITED KINGDOM    &apos;Memorandum by the Home Secretary1.     At their meeting on 18th July, (CM. (1+9) 46th Conclusions,Minute 7) the Cabinet invited me to submit a memorandum onthe question whether powers should be taken to enable theGovernment to deport British subjects who, not being citizens of the United Kingdom, engage in subversive activities in thiscountry.     on 21st July, in Supplementary Questions about the dock strike, Mr. W. J. Brown, M.P. , and Mr. Eden, M.P. , asked why the Government did not take power to deport the Canadiancitizens who were fomenting the strike; and Mr. Brown has now put down the following Question for answer on 28th July:-&quot;To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department,whether he has given consideration to the question of seeking, by legislation or otherwise, powers to deport totheir country of origin persons seeking to disrupt thenormal industrial life of Britain; and what conclusion hehas now reached.&quot; 12.     My existing powers of deportation are contained (i) inthe Aliens Order, 1920, which enables me to deport any alien:-(a) if he has been convicted of an offence for whichhe could be imprisoned without the option of a fine (or of one or two other specific offences)and the court has recommended his deportation;(b) if a court of summary jurisdiction certifies withintv/elve months after his last entry to theUnited Kingdom (i) that he has within the precedingthree months been in receipt of poor relief or&apos;found wandering without visible means of subsistence,or (ii) that he has been sentenced in a foreign country for an extradition crime; or(c) if I deem it to be conducive to the public good tomake a Deportation Order against him.3,     I also have certain powers under the Prevention of violence (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1939, to expel from great Britain any person, whether an alien or a British subject,who has not been ordinarily resident in Great Britain throughoutthe prceding twenty years or, if he is under 20, throughout hislife.      These powers can be used only &quot;with a view to preventing the commission in Great Britain of acts of violence designed to influence public opinion or Government policy with respect toIrish affairs&quot;, and, before making an expulsion order against any person I must be reasonably satisfied that he is concernedin the preparation or instigation of acts of violence designed

to influence public opinion or Government policy with respectto Irish affairs, or is knowingly   harbouring a person soconcerned.     If the person against whom the order is madeobjects that no   sufficient ground exists, I am obliged,unless the objection is frivolous, to refer it to an independentperson for inquiry.     The Act, which is renewed from year to year, was designed to deal with the exceptional conditionscreated by the I.R,A. bomb outrages and 190 expulsion orders have been made under it.     No orders have been made since theend of the war.q..     During the war British subjects who came to Great Britainfrom Ireland were admitted subject to certain conditions as to employment and time of stay imposed under Defence Regulation18(2A) and there was power to send back to Ireland any person who failed to comply with the conditions imposed on him.Defence Regulation 18(2A) has been revoked.5.      The position as regards deportation of British subjects from independent Commonwealth countries is as follows.      InCanada, Australia and South Africa there is power under the immigration Acts to deport any person who falls within the definition of a &quot;prohibited immigrant&quot;, which includes personswho are classed as undesirable on various grounds.     TheAustralian Government have, in addition, power to deport anyperson not born in Australia who, on proclamation of industrialdisturbance or within three years thereafter, is considered asinjurious to peace, order and good government by hinderingtransport of goods, conveyance of. passengers or provision of services.     The New Zealand Government have power under an act of 1919 to deport any disaffected or disloyal person or one likely to be a source of danger to peace, order and. good government, who is not permanently resident or has not beenpermanently resident for twelve months.     The Government of ceylon under an Act of 19U8 have power to deport any person who is not a citizen of Ceylon where it is considered conductive to the public interest to do so.     The Government of india have no general power to deport a British subject.     Theyhave, however, a Public Safety Act under which it is possiblefor a rule to be framed whereby a United Kingdom citizen or aBritish subject can be deported.      In Pakistan the power to deport British subjects applies only to persons without meansof support.     The position in India and Pakistan is a survivalfrom the period of British rule and it may well be that beforevery long these Governments will take powers similar to thosepossessed by the older Commonwealth countries.There are also in a number of Colonial Territoriesstatutes authorising the Colonial Government in certaincircumstances to deport British subjects who do not belong to the Territory.6,     The possibility of taking power to deport Britishsubjects from the United Kingdom has been considered from timeto time over the past thirty years:-(a) In 1919 the then Home Secretary considered aproposal that legislation should be introduced to give himpowers to deport undesirable British subjects who had cometo the United Kingdom from overseas.     The grounds for theproposal were that Indians and negroes with revolutionarytendencies were using the United Kingdom as headquarters fortheir propaganda, and that other Commonwealth countries (e.g.Canada) had taken or were taking such powers.     It was, however,decided not to introduce the proposed legislation.

(b) In 193k the Cabinet considered possible measures toreduce the influx from Ireland of persons who were seeking the better social services in the United Kingdom, but no action was taken.(c) Both before and since the war the police have represented that certain Cypriots and Maltese who make a practice of living on the immoral earnings of women shouldbe deported.      Representations have also been made in favourof restricting the admission of, and returning to their country of origin, coloured persons from British colonies who cometo this country as seamen, stowaways or ordinary immigrantsand congregate in certain areas such as East London, liverpool and Cardiff, where they live, in squalid conditions.      Inagreement with the Colonial office, however, the view hasalways been taken that it would be impossible to deport such persons.7.      It might be argued that to take power to deport Britishsubjects from the United Kingdom would not be inconsistent with the new conception of Commonwealth citizenship underwhich a person is first a citizen of an individual commonwealth country or of the United Kingdom and Colonies, and by virtue ofthis achieves the status of British subject.     And, on the face of it, we may seem to be handicapped in not being ableto deport from the United Kingdom a citizen of some other commonwealth country for stirring up trouble here, when allindependent Commonwealth countries and some Colonies have thepower to deport United Kingdom citizens.      My own view,however,  is that at the present critical stage in thedevelopment- of the Commonwealth it would be a serious mistake to depart from our traditional policy of giving all Britishsubjects the right to enter the United Kingdom and to enjoy the same rights and privileges as are given to United kingdom nationals.      It is important that the status of being aBritish subject should have a real meaning, and freedom toenter and remain in the United Kingdom is one of the mainpractical benefits that British subjects enjoy.      We have notin fact such good grounds as most of the other commonwealth countries for taking paver to deport,  since we are not a country of immigration, and whatever changes may have takenplace in citizenship law, the United Kingdom is still regardedas the home land by people in all parts of the Commonwealth,and I am convinced that&quot;anything we might gain by taking powerto deport British subjects would be immeasurably less than the damage which would be done by a departure from the principlethat all British subjects should receive equal treatment inthe United Kingdom.      I think that the reception given tothe reply which I gave to the Supplementary Questions on21st July shows that the majority of Members of all parties would on reflection share my view.8.     Apart from the general objections.to the taking of powerto denort British subjects, I would draw the Cabinet&apos;attention to two serious difficulties which would arise if we were to propose legislation in the sense suggested:-(a) The Commonwealth Relations Office would, I understand,regard it as anomalous to take power to deport from theUnited Kingdom citizens of independent Commonwealth countriesif we did not also take power to deport citizens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies whose ordinary place of residenceis a Colony.      On the other hand, the Colonial Office considerthat to take power to deport citizens of the United Kingdomand Colonies is inconsistent with the single citizenshipwhich the United Kingdom shares with the Colonies.

(b) It seems clear that Parliament would never agreeto give me -power to deport any British subject against whom deemed it conducive to the public good to make aDeportation Order, and that it would be necessary to specifythe grounds on which a British subject could be deported.On the other hand, it would not be effective to limit theexercise of the power to persons convicted by the courts of offences under the existing law, since, as the recentdock strike has shown, a citizen of a Commonwealth country can create industrial unrest without doing anything thatwould render him liable to prosecution.      It would, therefore,be necessary to define certain action (e.g. action designedto foment industrial unrest, or to prejudice the economy of the country or the maintenance of essential services)which, if taken by a British subject who is not a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies, would render him liableto deportation, though if taken by a citizen of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies it would not be an offence.It seems to me extremely doubtful whether Parliament would approve a provision of this kind.9.     I accordingly recommend that we should not seekpowers to deport British subjects from the United Kingdomand that I should reply to Mr. W.J, Brown1 s parliamentary question on 28th July as follows&quot;I already have power to deport any alienagainst whom I deem it to be conducive to thepublic good to make a Deportation Order and I havenot hesitated to exercise this power.      I have considered very carefully whether I should seekpower&apos; to deport British subjects from the United Kingdom,but I have come to the conclusion that it would bev/rong to depart from the traditional policy of giving. all British subjects freedom to enter and remain inthe United Kingdom. &quot;J. C. E.Home Office,Whitehall, S.W. 1.25TH JULY, 1949.
