litTHIi DOLLAR SITUATION;   - CANADA 1 S ATTITUDENote of a Meeting held at Chequers on10th August.  1949,  at 5.1.5 p.m.vPRESENT:The Rt. Hon. C.R. Attlee, M. P. ,Prime minister the Rt. Hon. Viscount Ad-dison, The Hon.  Sir Alexander Clutterbuck,Lord Privy Seal &apos; United Kingdom High Commissionedin CanadaSir Norman BrookTHE PRIME MINISTER began by asking whether the Canadiansyet realised that, in present conditions of world trade, theycould not expect to maintain an economy based on selling their-primary products to the United Kingdom and importing theirmanufactured goods from the United States.      If not, ought wenot to force them to face this issue - for example, by proposing that, for part at any rate of their exports to this country,they should accept payment in sterling?THE HIGH COMMISSIONER said that the. Canadians were notyet in a mood to face this issue.      They had not given up all &apos;hope of restoring the pre-war triangular pattern of trade .between canada,  the United Kingdom and the United States.      They hopedthat,  in consultation with the United States Government, some means might eventually be found of securing an economic collaboration between the three countries comparable to the political collaborationI which had already been achieved in the Atlantic Pact;    and thatthrough this Canada might find a way of avoiding too drastica disruption of her traditional economy.      These long-term problems, however, they regarded as essentially a second stage in any economic discussions with the United States Government.The first stage was to find means of overcoming the immediate difficulties of the sterling Commonwealth;    arid,, until some temporary solution had been found for the pressing problems ofthe moment, they would no&apos;-, be anxious to consider the long-Iterm situation.      They would be most reluctant to alter the wholepattern of their trade, and would not be willing to attempt thisuntil they were satisfied that no other course was practicable.And they could not be so satisfied until they had seen what[solution of the short-term difficulties could be devised inconsultation between the three Governments. &apos;    The nature of thatSolution would inevitably affect their attitude towards the long-term problem;    and for that reason they would be unwilling to facejhat they regarded as essentially the second stage of these&apos;liscussions until the results of the first stage were known.

The High Commissioner proceeded to outline the attitudeof the Canadian Government towards the forthcoming discussions in Washington.      The Canadian Administration were better informed about the economic situation   than the Canadian public, and inconsequence were more sympathetic towards the difficulties ofthe United Kingdom.     They realised that the current dollarproblem could not be solved by one Government alone., butonly by the three Governments in consultation.      But, even so, theCanadian Government - and still more the Canadian public -approached this problem on the basis that, of the three partiesto the discussions, it was the United Kingdom Government(on behalf of the sterling Commonwealth) that was in immediate difficulties.      They and the Americans therefore felt entitledto expect that the United Kingdom Government would open thediscussions by indicating what measures they were prepared totake to help themselves out of those difficulties.      If we could show that we had a plan for helping ourselves, thiswould elicit a favourable response from the Canadians and americans, who would be anxious to find a means by which theycould contribute.      In this atmosphere it should be possible,not only to find some way out of the immediate difficulties, butalso to approach the long-term problems.      If, on the other hand,we opened the Washington talks by asking what the otherGovernments were prepared to do to help us    their response wouldbe unfavourable and it was unlikely that the discussions would lead to any useful practical results.THE PRIME MINISTER asked what kind of proposals the canadians expected us to put forward.THE HIGH COMMISSIONER explained that, in the view of .the Canadian Government, our dollar difficulties were leading toloss of confidence in Britain&apos;s capacity to pay her way.Hitherto- there had been a widespread belief in the western hemisphere that the United Kingdom would overcome her economic difficulties.      Doubts had now set in.      Werews tackling thetask of economic recovery in the right way?     Certainly we had made great progress in increasing our production and our exports;but had this been achieved at the expense of building up a high-cost structure which was now making it difficult for us to sell our exports in a buyer&apos;s -market?     Public opinion in Canada and theUnited States believed that this was so, and therefore expected usnow to be applying corrective measures, including measures tocurb public expenditure and to reduce production costs.      If weshowed that we were willing to apply such measures, both canada and the United States would be anxious to give us all the helpthey could.      If, on the other hand, we declared that therewas nothing wrong with our economy, or that there was nothingthat we could do to make our products more competitive and that itwas rather for others to help us, Canada and the United States   ,would be reluctant to offer-further help.      The Candians wouldnot of course presume to suggest what remedies might be appliedto adjust our internal economy.      But they did expect that weshould take the initiative, in the Washington discussions,  mannouncing what measures we proposed to apply for this purpose.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was not clear to himwhat form such proposals should take.     The advantages to hegained from a modification of exchange rates were -debatable, .As regards public expenditure, he would welcome any reasonableeconomies which could be made;   but it should not be forgotten that a substantial part of our expenditure was incurred on defence^ and the Americans had never shown any signs of willingness to see us reduce our defence commitments - indeed, their pressure upon us in this matter had been in the opposite direction.     Asregards production costs he could not accept the view that&apos; our -export prices generally were non-competitive.     For capital goods and engineering products we were still able to find markets inthe Western Hemisphere:.    it was only in consumer goods that ourprices seemed to be out of line with those of our Americancompetitors.In further discussion the following points were made :-(a) The greatest single contribution towards the solutionof the short-term problem would be the resumption of economic co-operation Administration (E.C.A.) financing of our purchases of Canadian wheat.     This had been suspended because E.C.A.had feared that wheat might be declared surplus in the UnitedStates, with a fall in domestic wheat prices below the Canadiancontract price of $2.      In fact, however, this had not happened;and there was some hope that the United States Government might agree that E.C.A. dollars might again be made available for our purchases of Canadian wheat, at any rate up to the ceiling of$1 .80, prescribed by the International Wheat Agreement.     TheCanadian Government had not given up hope of this - indeed they felt very strongly on the matter - and it was most important that they should be persuaded to join with us in pressing the americans to give a favourable decision on this point.(b) The United States Government, while urging othercountries&quot;to apply the principles of free trade, insisted on maintaining their policy of price support for Americanagriculture.      Should it not be argued that what was fair for wheat was fair also for the primary products of the sterling commonwealth e.g. tin, rubber, cocoa and wool ?     Much of our difficulties could be met if the prices of these commoditiescould be maintained at reasonable levels.(c) Public opinion in Canada and the United States tended to assume that our current, difficulties were due to a drop in exports of United Kingdom manufactured goods to dollar markets,and further to assume that this was due to the high cost ofthose exports.     In fact, our difficulties were more largely due to a drop in the volume and value of exports to dollarmarkets of primary products from the rest of the sterling area..It would be useful if it could be brought out in the course ofthe Washington discussions (i) what proportion of our loss indollar earnings was attributable to decreased earnings onprimary products from the rest of the sterling area;    (ii) what proportion of the dollar earnings of the sterling Commonwealthwas represented by exports of United Kingdom manufactured goods,and (iii) within the total of United Kingdom exports, what wasthe proportion (e.g. of.consumer goods) whose prices were not fully competitive with those of the United- States.

(&amp;)   The Secretary of the Canadian Cabinet had recentlypaid a visit to the United States in the course of which hehad held some helpful conversations on the course of theforthcoming discussions in Washington.     He had found thatthe Agenda which the Americans were proposing for those discussions placed excessive emphasis on the action whichmight be taken by the debtor countries;    and he had urgedthat the Agenda should preserve a better balance betweenpossible action by debtor countries and possible action bycreditor countries.     He believed that these representationshad been effective.(e)   The Secretary of the Canadian Cabinet had 1alsofound an opportunity to represent to the United states authorities the importance of their taking some early actionto encourage a new up-swing in the United States economy.There was a tendency in Washington to regard as normalanything up to 5% of unemployment;    to regard unemploymentfrom 5% &quot;to 10$ as a cause for anxiety;   but to defer anyremedial action until the total of unemployment passed above10$.      He had urged that, if the United States Governmentcould introduce remedial measures now with a view tore-introducing an atmosphere of boom conditions within theUnited States, this would not only bring immediate benefitto world trade hut would, also create within the United Statesa climate of public opinion more favourable to any proposalsinvolving further financial assistance to foreign countries.At the end of the meeting, THE HIGH COMMISSIONER I said that, while he would deprecate any early approach to the ECanadian Government on the long-term problem, he was in Ifavour of making an immediate approach to them on the short-     Iterm problem, with a view, particularly, to enlisting their        Ifull support of an effort to persuade the United StatesGovernment to authorise the resumption of E.C.A. financingfor our purchases of Canadian wheat.     He had been preparing,in consultation with the Treasury, the draft of an aidememoire on this subject which he might present to theCanadian Government on his return to Ottawa.     He would bein a position to submit&apos; a final draft of this document to thePrime Minister on the following day.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would be glad,to have this and would take an opportunity of discussing it with some of his colleagues when he was in London on Friday, I12th August. &apos; I
