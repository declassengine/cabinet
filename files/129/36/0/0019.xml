IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)SECRET war . (1+9) 169 COPY NO.  g   /27TH JULY. 191+9CABINETTRADE REW.TIONS V/ITH CANADA.Memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI was invited (CM. (1+9) k&amp;th Conclusions, Minute 2)to circulate a paper on the question of Canada1s future trade relations with the sterling area.2* I accordingly attach a memorandum by the Treasurywhich examines the 1949/50 situation v/ith special referenceto the proposal that Canada should accept sterling for that part of her exports to the sterling area not covered bycurrent earnings or by existing forms of financial assistance.My own view is that this is a question the Canadians will haveto face up to sooner or later.     The conditions under which wewere able to finance their United States dollar expenditurethrough the dollars obtained by sterling area sales to theUnited States and by other means no longer exist, nor are theylikely to exist.     The Canadians therefore cannot expect usindefinitely to be responsible for financing their (largelyuncontrolled) United States dollar expenditure.      Sooner or later they must be confronted with this situation, and certainlyas part of any &quot;general settlement&quot; this question must be tackled.At the same time we are faced with a difficult problem of timing,-3, - The problem before us is, I suggest, to ensure thatCanadian Ministers come to the discussions in Washington in amood to assist us. and not to side v/ith the Americans.     On theone hand* it would produce the worst possible effect if we wereto come out with these proposals in the middle of the washington disscusions without any preliminary warning to Mr. Abbott.      Onthe other hand, to put them crudely to him forthwith would, i suggest, create an equally bad impression.     No mention was madeof them during the recent London discussions, except by Mr. Nash,who merely elicited a most unfavourable reaction from Mr. Abbott.1+. I conclude, therefore, that towards the end of Augustwe should take the most convenient opportunity of having ourthoughts conveyed to the Canadian Government, either by the HighCommissioner or, as I&apos;would prefer, and I.think could arrange,by&apos; such unobtrusive and high level official meeting as can bearranged without giving the appearance of ganging-up againstthe Americans.H.

ILLATIONS WITH, CANADA-Memorandum by the Treasury *Sterling Area Balance of Payments with Canadaf&quot; ,,,,,, hPJL^81^1?8 ?rea balancq of payments with Canadaincluded in our original programme for the Organisation for european Economic Cooperation (o.E.E.0. ) in May is set out in annex A.     This provided for United Kingdom imports of $691millions.     Of this, $285 millions would be financed by earnedCanadian dollars and $120 millions by the Canadian Credit,leaving $286 millions to be financed otherwise - either from our reserves or&apos; by dollars indirectly provided by the economic co-operation Administration (E.C.A.).2t On our latest estimates of earnings which provided thebasis for our supplementary memorandum to O.E.E.C., indicatinga deficit with the dollar area as a whole of $1,518 millions,our net earnings of Canadian dollars are reduced from $285millions to $177 millions.     This arises from the lower expecta-tions of earnings both by ourselves and by the other sterling area countries.     This would mean that if we and the other sterling area countries made no cuts in our imports from Canada,and if the Canadian&apos;Credit remained at $120 millions, we shouldhave to find nearly $1+00 millions (691 minus 177 minus 120) from our reserves or indirectly from E, C A. financing.3t Ministers are aware of the complications which arise from E.C.A. financing of Canadian produce.     These are being actively discussed with E. C. A.     We should like to arrange mattersso that we cover the bulk of our Canadian import programme withE. .C.A, finance, thus releasing some of our earnings in Canadafor&apos; purchases in the United States which are ineligible forE. C. A. financing under any conditions.     But at the very leastwe want to cover our Canadian deficit with E.C.A.  finance, forotherwise the money has to be drawn direct from our reserves.It must be regarded as most unlikely, however, that E.C.A. willbe able to help us effectively in this;    they have legal diffi-culties with which to contend.     We cannot work on the assump-tion that we shall be able to f-finance more than, say, $150millions of our Canadian imports with E.C.A. finance and thiswould leave $250 millions to be C-vmm from our reserves.U* Ministers are now working on the basis of cuts of$400 millions in our total dollar import programme as submittedto 0. E.E.C.  in May.      About $100 millions of this would fall onCanada (bacon, timber, pulp, non-ferrous metals).     The colonies and the rest of the sterling area may save about $30 millions by cutting their imports.      But this covers only one half of the deficit of $250 millions and it also assumes that Canada will be willing to go on allowing us to draw on the Credit in spite ofthe fact that we shall not be buying the goods they like to sellto us.      The scale of the problem is, therefore, very large.Payment in Sterlinp;5. It has been suggested that Canada should be willing toaccept unconvertible sterling in settlement for the uncoveredpart of the sterling area&apos;s deficit with Canada.      In the shortrun this would have the same effect for Canada as an additionalloan to us, inasmuch as for a substantial proportion of her exports to the sterling area she would receive payment inunconvertible sterling not available to finance her dollar imports.      In the long run Canada ought to.be able,  at the costof considerable discrimination against the United States, to use this sterling substantially to increase her imports from theUnited Kingdom and the rest of the sterling area;   to the extent that she did so in substitution for dollar imports, the actualgrant of further credit to us would be reduced.

6* rfe believe there to be little prospect that the canadians-would in fact accept such a proposal.     A similarproposal was made to Mr. Abbott by Mr. Nash during theMeeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers and he rejected it out of hand.      Canada&apos;s direct deficit with the United states is now running at about $700 millions a year (it has lately been rising).      In order to provide us with our requirementswithout payment in dollars, they would either have to cutdown their imports from the United States further or draw upon their reserves.     Their reserves now stand at $980 millions,which are not large in relation to the scale of their tran-section with the United States.      Their exports to theUnited States in 1949/50 are estimated at $1,400 millions -they are substantially.larger than those of the entiresterling area to the United States - and they are subject to just the same sort of fluctuations as the sterling areaexports,7. The Canadian Government are at present taking a rather more optimistic view of the prospects of Canada&apos;sexports in the United States in the coming year than we aretaking of our prospects.     But their position is certainlyvery vulnerable.      It would no doubt be possible- for them toreduce their United States imports to an extent which would permit them to extend to us more credit than they are nowdoing.      In the long run, if they discriminated greatly infavour of the sterling area against the United States, theycould substitute sterling area imports in v/hole or in partfor the United States imports thus given up.      All the indications which- we have received, however, suggest thatthey would be most unwilling to extend more credit to usexcept as part of a general settlement.8. It seems most unlikely, therefore, that if weapproached the Canadians now we should receive a favourable response;    indeed, if we put the point too baldly we mightwell prejudice their attitude in the forthcoming tripartitetalks.Import Cuts and Contracts9. We cannot make Canada hold sterling against herwill.      If we take delivery of the goods, we have to pay forthem.      Our only means of avoiding a net payment of dollarswould be to reduce our import programme from Canada to thepoint at which we could finance it with our earnings from canada, eked out by E.C.A.  dollars for offshore purchases.10. Our uncut programme from Canada is set out in annex A.      Out of this uncut programme of $691 millions, weare already contracted for over $500 millions.-     The wheat iscontracted for the full year;    the bacon, eggs and cheese arecontracted up to the end of 1949;    raw materials are substan-tially contracted only to the end of 1949.      Certain of our supplies from Canada must be purchased in any event;   forexample, if we did not buy more ferro-alloys, we should be faced with a catastrophic decline in steel production.      Ofthe uncommitted part of our programme - the difference between$691 millions and $500 millions - it would probably be physically impossible to make cuts of more than the $100millions which Ministers are already allowing.      The resultof this is that we should be forced to cancel contracts if we wished to reduce our imports from Canada to a point at whichwe did not have to pay them dollars from our reserve.11. Refusal to pay in dollars, even if accompanied bywillingness to make payment in inconvertible sterling, wouldnot save us from the consequences of repudiation of the contracts.      The contracts^inevitably provide for payment in

a form^ acceptable to the supplier.      It is clear, moreoverthat, if we cancelled contracts, we should have no hope of*continuing to draw on the Canadian Credit and we should not getthe assistance of the Canadian Government in our export drive.It is,very doubtful indeed whether we should actually savedollars by this process.      Indeed,&apos; we should probably losedollars as well as creating a complete breach between ourselves and the Canadians.12. On the other hand, the Canadians would certainly have great difficulty in disposing of their exports for dollarselsewhere.     The United States has a substantial wheat surplusand other countries would much sooner buy United States wheaton E. R.P.  terms than buy&apos;Canadian wheat for free dollars.The other Canadian agricultural products have no overseasmarket except the United Kingdom.      In timber and pulp, similar considerations apply.      The Canadians will be much less able tosell their non-ferrous metals in the United States than theywould have been some months ago.     The Canadians&apos; difficultiesin these conditions would certainly be very great.13. It is impossible to predict the outcome of a tug-of-war of this kind in which we were announcing our determination to repudiate contracts and to cut ourselves off from Canadaif the Canadians refused to accept payment in sterling.     Weconsider it unlikely, however,&apos; that the Canadians would beprepared to yield to our point of view.     Admittedly, theirown difficulties would be considerable if we cut off supplies from Canada.      But it is most unlikely that they would,be so great as to force the Canadian Government to make this further contribution to the solution of current difficulties, partic-particularly in the intensels^ hostile atmosphere which will exist ifwe were cancelling contracts to which His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave repeatedly announced their intentions to adhere.     TheCanadian Government would, of course, have to go to itsParliament for the funds, either for a further direct creditor for dollars to pay the Canadian exporters.      There hasalready&apos; been sufficient bad blood about the Canadian wheatcontract and our successive cuts in imports to make it highlydoubtful that the Canadian Parliament would agree to action,to help us in these circumstances.1k, If the Canadian Government reacted violently against our attitude they might, with the support of the canadian parliament, demand that we liquidated investments in Canada inorder to enable us to continue to meet our contracts.      Theseinvestments are still large and total about $900 millions -their liquidation would be more than enough to loo:: after thisparticular situation in the next year or two.      The canadian government and the Bank of Canada have been extremely unwilling to have us liquidate our investments and we have had no pressureat all from them to do this.      But in the sort of circumstances which we are here considering, their attitude might well change.15. In that event, at the end of the day we might find thatwe had cut ourselves off from supplies which are essential to us and which would cost us the equivalent of dollars elsewhere.We should probably find we were still paying the Canadianssome dollars.     We should have lost access to the CanadianCredit.    We might well find ourselves making forced sales ofour investments in Canada.      To precipitate any of these -possible dangers would produce an effect upon the discussions in September which would be catastrophic and the political consequences would be incalculable.
