fHIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT    /Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1949CONFIDENTIALCopy No.3 1CP. (49) 16625th July, 1949CABINETCONDITIONS OF LABOUR IN NON-METROPOLITAN TERRITORIESInternational Labour Conventions adopted at the 30th Session of theInternational Labour Conference, Geneva, 1947Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Ministerof Labour and National service. This memorandum contains our recommendations for action by HisMajesty&apos;s Government in respect of the following five International labour conventions adopted at the 30th Session of the International Labour Conferenceat Geneva in 1947, concerning conditions of labour in non-metropolitan territories : Convention  No.  82,  concerning  social  policy  in  non-metropolitan territories.Convention No. 83, concerning the application of international labour standards to non-metropolitan territories.Convention No. 84, concerning the right of association and the settlementof labour disputes in non-metropolitan territories.Convention No. 85, concerning labour inspectorates in non-metropolitan territories.Convention No. 86, concerning the maximum length of contracts ofemployment in non-metropolitan territories.2.. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have always play a leading part in the framing and implementation of International Labour Gventions for the improvement of labour conditions in. Colonial territories, and united Kingdom Delegations played a prominent part in the proceedings at i ?various Sessions of the Conference which eventually led to the adoption of thet,new Conventions.   We propose that His Majesty&apos;s Government should ratify allfive Conventions and that the ratification should in each case be accompanied bya Declaration of the kind required by the Convention showing : (a) The territories in respect of which His Majesty&apos;s Government undertakethat the provisions of the Convention shall be applied without modification.(&amp;) The territories in respect of which His Majesty&apos;s Government undertakethat the provisions of the Convention shall be applied subject tomodifications, together with details of the said modifications.(c) The territories in respect of which the Convention is inapplicable,.and insuch cases the grounds on which it is inapplicable.(d) The territories in respect of which His Majesty&apos;s Government reserve their decision.37333b
3. There is at Appendix I a short historical note on International labour conventions relating to non-metropolitan territories, together with a briefdescription of the five Conventions on this subject listed in paragraph 2 above and a summary of the extent to which they can be applied to the Colonial terri-tories. At Appendix II there is a more detailed statement on the applicationof these Conventions in the different territories under the headings of theDeclaration required by each Convention., 4. The constitutional position in many of the territories is such that thepractical application of the Conventions lies within the control of the local legis-Legislatures and Cannot be directed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom except by special Act of Parliament. Though much can be done bypersuasion, it would be contrary to our Colonial policy to take any steps whichwould weaken the constitutional position of Colonial Governments for the purposeof securing the introduction of legislation for which the territories concerned arenot yet ready. It is considered, moreover, that the proposed action on the fiveConventions shows that the Colonial Governments not only recognise the principles on which they are based but are making determined and successful efforts to put them into practice.5. We recommend that Declarations in accordance with Appendix II shouldbe communicated by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Director-General of theInternational Labour Office. If these proposals are approved we would propose,in accordance with practice, to make known the Government^ intentions by meansof a White Paper which would incorporate the whole of Appendix II.A. C.

APPENDIX IInternational Labour Conventions relating to Non-MetropolitanTerritoriesDescription of Conventions adopted at 30tfA Session of International LabourConference and Summary of Extent to which they can be applied to ColonialTerritoriesDuring the ten years preceding the war four Conventions specially affectingColonial territories were adopted by the International Labour Organisation, viz.,the Porced Labour Convention, 1930, the Recruiting of Indigenous WorkersConvention, 1936, the Contracts of Employments (Indigenous Workers) Conven-tion, 1939, and the Penal Sanctions (Indigenous Workers) Convention of the sameyear. The United Kingdom Government ratified these four Conventions andfurnishes the International Labour Office with annual reports showing the steps taken by British Colonial Governments to give effect to them.2. The 26th and 27th Sessions of the International Labour Conference, heldrespectively in Philadelphia in 1944 and in Paris in 1945, discussed labour conditions in Colonial territories in connection with proposals put forward by theInternational Labour Office for the establishment of minimum standards of social policy in dependent territories. These discussions resulted in the adoption at each Conference of certain Recommendations.3. The 29th Session of the Conference held at Montreal in 1946 consideredwhat parts of these Recommendations could be suitably transformed into aConvention or Conventions and decided to put before the next Conference theconclusions reached by its Committee on Minimum Standards of Social Policy inDependent Territories. These conclusions stated the main subjects for three.Conventions, the first concerning social policy, the second the application of certaininternational labour standards and the third concerning the maximum length of contracts of employment. In each case the conclusions stated the provisions tobe taken into account by the International Labour Office in preparing the drafts of these Conventions.4. The final stage was reached at the 30th Session of the Conference, heldin Geneva in 1947, when it was decided that the subject matter of the threeproposed Conventions could more conveniently be split up into five Conventions.The following five Conventions were then adopted : Convention No. 82, concerning social policy in non-metropolitan territories.Convention No. 83, concerning the application of international labour standards to non-metropolitan territories.Convention No. 84, concerning the right of association and the settlementof labour disputes in non-metropolitan territories.Convention No. 85, concerning labour inspectorates in. non-metropolitan territories.Convention No. 86, concerning the maximum length of contracts ofemployment in non-metropolitari territories. .The line taken by the United Kingdom Delegation to the Conference is set outin Cmd. 7437, presented to Parliament in July, 1948, which also contains the texts of the Conventions in question. A brief account of their general provisionsfollows.5. The Convention on Social Policy covers a particularly wide field. In thewords of Article 4 of the Convention &quot;all possible steps shall be taken by appropriate international, regional, national and territorial measures to promoteimprovement in such fields as public health, housing, nutrition, education, the welfare of children, the status of women, conditions of employment, the remunera-tion of wage earners and independent producers, the protection of migrantworkers, social security, standards of public services and general production.&quot;Special provisions refer to the protection of the rights of migrant workers, the encouragement of collective bargaining for. the purpose of establishing minimum37333 b 2
wages and non-discrimination on grounds of race, colour, sex, belief, tribal assoeia-tion or trade union affiliation. The Convention was adopted by 103 votes for to one against.6. The Convention on the Application of International Labour Standardsprovides for the application of certain existing Conventions to non-metropolitan territories for which Member States have responsibility in such matters. the conventions in question form an annex to the Convention. This Instrumentrepresents a new departure in International Labour Organisation practice sincethe Conventions may, in certain cases, be ones which have not been ratified onbehalf of the metropolitan territory concerned; the form of the Conventionnevertheless enables consideration to be given by the State Member concerned tothe extent to which such Conventions may be applied to the non-metropolitan territories for which that Member is responsible. The Convention was adoptedby 95 votes for to 20 votes against.7. The Convention on the Right of A association and the Settlement of labour disputes seeks to protect the rights of employers and employed to associate forlawful purposes, and in particular the right of trade unions to conclude collective agreements with employers&apos; organisations. It also proposes that conciliation machinery for the rapid settlement of industrial disputes should be encouraged.The Convention was adopted by 121 votes for to none against.8. The provisions of the Convention on Labour Inspectorates relate tp thestatus, duties and rights of such inspectorates. The Convention was adoptedby 120 votes for to none against.9. The Convention on Maximum Length of Contracts provides for the regulation by agreements of the maximum periods of service for single workers and for workers accompanied by their&apos;families. It was adopted by 99 votes for to none against.10. The views of Colonial Governments have been obtained by the Colonial-Office on the extent to which the five Conventions may be applied to their territory-ries. Appendix II reflects the replies of Colonial Governments. It shows that,with few exceptions, the three Conventions concerning the Right of Association,* Labour Inspectorates and the Maximum Length of Contracts of Employmentcan be applied without modification to Colonial territories. (The extent to whichthe Conventions are applicable in the case of the self-governing ConstitutionalMonarchy of Tonga and in the Anglo-French Condominium of the New Hebrideshas not yet been established, and, in consequence, these territories are not coveredby the present memorandum.)*11. With regard to the Social Policy Convention, the most important of thefive Conventions, eighteen territories agree that the Convention can be appliedto them without modification. Twenty-three other territories agree to its applica-tion to them subject to the exclusion of one or more of the Articles (14, 15, 16, 17)dealing with the remuneration of workers and related questions, and /or Article 19concerning the school-leaving age. There are no objections in principle to theterms of these Articles, but they lay down requirements necessitating the introduc-tion of legislation which at this date the Colonial Territories in question wouldnot be able to implement. It is desired to reserve the position in respect of sarawak, but only until such time as all the necessary legislation can be enactedand all the requisite staff can be provided.12. The replies on Convention No. 83 on the possibility of applying to non-metropolitan territories certain existing International Labour Conventionsdisclose a not unsatisfactory position. There are thirteen Conventions in the annex to this Convention, including those concerning the Night Work of YoungPersons (Industry), 1919, and the Night Work of Women (Revised), 1934 (bothof which Conventions have been recently denounced by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentbecause of the too inflexible definition of &apos;&apos; night&apos;&apos; for technical reasons and have. been replaced by revised Conventions), and the Marking of Weight(Packages Transported by Vessels) 1929, and the Medical Examination of YoungPersons (Industry) 1946 : these two last-named Conventions have not been ratified by His Majesty&apos;s Government. We propose that for Colonial territories theposition should be reserved in respect of these four Conventions included in the annex to Convention No. 83.
