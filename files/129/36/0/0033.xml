(49) 18325th August, 1949CABINETSECRET Copy No..t3;;;i:.MIDDLE EAST policy note by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs have recently reviewed our whole policy in the Middle East with HisMajesty&apos;s Representatives in most of the Middle East countries. I should liketo give the Cabinet a complete picture of our interests and objectives in that area as I see them as a result of these discussions. I circulate herewith a paperdrawn up for this purpose.This does not contain any striking innovation. It is mainly a reaffirmationof the policy pursued hitherto, which is itself the result of a progressive develop-ment since this Government took office.If the general lines of the paper are approved, I shall regard it as a generaldirective for all Middle East questions.E.

secret copy &quot;No.MIDDLE EAST POLICYGENERAL PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMSImportance of the Middle East1. In peace and war the Middle East is an area of cardinal importance tothe United Kingdom, second only to the United Kingdom itself. Strategically theMiddle East is a focal point of communications, a source of oil, a shield toAfrica and the Indian Ocean, and an irreplaceable offensive base. Economicallyit is, owing to oil and cotton, essential to United Kingdom recovery.British Position and Responsibilities2. In addition to these vital strategic and economic interests, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have weighty responsibilities towards the peoples of the middle east by history, tradition and in some cases by treaty. Our influence is greaterthan that of any other foreign Power. It is essential that we should maintain our special position and carry out our special responsibilities.Dangers3. The main threats to the Middle East and to our position there arise from: (a) the danger of disintegration due to the backwardness of many middle east countries and the instability of their relations with each other;(6) the tension between Israel and the Arab States;(c) the opportunities which (a) and (&amp;) provide for Communist penetration;(d) the possibility of Russian armed aggression.Objectives4. Our general task must be to help Middle East Governments and peoplesto develop in such a way as to avoid the above dangers, and to maintain and increase our influence. Our help must be directed to strengthening defence andto social and economic development. It should consist of guidance, example,technical expertise, co-operation for defence and, subject to the limits of our resources, material assistance. To obtain success we must retain the initiative and, once our policy is decided, carry it out confidently and vigorously in spiteof possible criticism from individual States or interests.Outer Fringe5. While the central problems lie in the Semitic world, we must by no meansleave out of account the great importance of the outer fringe of Greece, persia and particularly Turkey.Co-operation with the United States6. In a major war the active partnership of the United States would beof supreme importance. In peace, economic development and refugee resettlementare impossible without large-scale United States participation. Alignment ofpolicy with the United States is accordingly essential. This need not necessarily involved the loss of our special position.France and other Western Powers7. There is a tradition of rivalry between the United Kingdom and france in the Middle East. It must be our aim to allay this without sacrificing anyessential British interest. There ought not to be any conflict of interest in theMiddle East between us and any Western Power except to some extent with italy and France over the disposal of the former Italian Colonies. We should2? 0^ ,,,sti0 convince the Western Union Powers of the necessity of holdingthe Middle East as well as Western Europe.37492
Israel8. Our aim must be that the whole of the Middle East, including both theArab countries and Israel, should have close and friendly relations with theWest, but if we were to gain the friendship of Israel at the expense of losingour position and influence in the Arab countries, we should lose more than weshould gain.   We must therefore hold the two if we can.Specific Tasks and Methods9. The following points are applicable to all or most of the area, subject tostated exceptions. Notes on some of the more important tasks and problems in individual countries are given in the Annex.Social and A administrative Reform10. The standards of administration are lamentably low by Westernstandards and in many cases declining. Except to some extent in Israel, Turkey,and to a lesser degree in the Lebanon and Jordan, social conditions are mostinequitable and provide an obvious field for Communist propaganda. Althoughthe present regimes are in most cases unsatisfactory, we are obliged to deal withthem in current affairs and there is usually no possible alternative regime whichwould not be under Communist or quasi-Fascist influence. We are often accused of deliberately supporting reactionary and corrupt regimes. One of our principaltasks must be to use every possible means to encourage the emergence of progressiveand honest governments and efficient administrations. Our means of carrying out this task are (a) Constant advice to Governments.(b) The supply of social and labour experts.(c) The supply of information about social developments in the UnitedKingdom.(d) Whenever we are able to give material or other assistance, we should seek to make use of it to secure an improvement in the local administrative and social conditions.(e) While being scrupulously careful not to join in any intrigues againstexisting regimes, we should lose no opportunity of maintaininginformal contact with progressive individuals or groups who seemto be genuinely working for administrative and social reform.11. Where drastic constitutional changes occur, as recently in Syria, weshould be ready to establish our influence with the new regime in order to makethe most of its plans for reform. But there can be no certainty that such changes will always be for the better, and in special cases, e.g., Iraq, there may well bespecial dangers.12. We should be particularly careful to ensure that social reform keepspace with economic development, e.g., that the reform of land tenure does not lag-behind the increase of irrigated land.Education13. In the long run progress towards more progressive and honest govern-ment will depend largely on education. Outside pressure on Governments towardsreform can never achieve the same results as pressure from an educated nucleuswithin. One of our most important general tasks must therefore be the encourage-ment of education on the right lines. Such encouragement can best be given in practical form by British Council advice to local educational authorities, by themaintenance and expansion of British schools and by the offer of scholarshipsin the United Kingdom. We should be prepared to devote increasing attention and resources to the creation and development of this nucleus in each country, evenperhaps at the expense of some other forms of expenditure.Economic Development14. The countries of the Middle East vary greatly in their resources. the populations are by no means commensurate with these resources (over-population in Egypt; under-population in Syria and Iraq; the greatest proved oil resources in the world in Kuwait with 150,000 inhabitants).   The standard of living is,
however, almost universally far too low except for a few people at the top, whosestandard is far too high. In most cases a redistribution of existing wealth wouldnot be enough to remedy the dangerously low standards of the masses. Thedevelopment of potential resources proportionately to the financial possibilitiesof each country must go hand in hand with social reform. &quot;Various schemes havebeen surveyed, e.g., the control of the Nile waters, irrigation and flood control inIraq, extensive agricultural development in North-Eastern Syria, and the com-Erehensive Seven-Year Plan in Persia. (A paper by the Middle East Officialommittee containing a selective list of projects is being considered by the official committee on Economic Development in relation to other calls on available resources from the Colonies, the Commonwealth, &amp;c.)External Finance15. Plans for economic development pose two extremely difficult financial problems -the provision of internal and external finance. It has been estimatedvery roughly that the projects whose early realisation the Middle East (Official)Committee believe to be desirable would call for an internal expenditure of about 70 millions over the next 10 or 15 years and external expenditure in foreigncurrencies of about  90 millions over the same period. Tp the extent that middle east Governments cannot meet external finance requirements from their ownearnings, the primary source for such finance is the International Bank for reconstruction and Development, in which the United States Government and HisMajesty&apos;s Government are major participants. There may be calls on the UnitedStates Government and on His Majesty&apos;s Government in addition. The attitude to be adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government in dealing with these requirements is discussed in paragraph 29 below.Internal Finance16. Difficult as the provision of external finance may be, the provision byMiddle East Governments of adequate internal finance is likely to be, if anything,a more intractable problem. It cannot be found without improved collection ofrevenue and higher taxes. These demand major administrative and politicalreforms, of which no Middle East regime has yet shown itself capable, but whichare absolutely essential if the objectives of our policy are to be achieved. Evenin advance of decisions about external finance, much can be done by His Majesty&apos;representatives to bring home to Middle East Governments the gravity of thedecisions with which they are faced in this internal field. We must continuallypress them not only to bring development plans to more advanced stages byexpediting technical study and preparation, but, more important still, to faceimmediately the administrative, political and social problems involved in theprovision of the necessary internal finance and in the creation of social conditionsin which the maximum benefit may be derived from the economic plans.British Middle East Office (B.M.E.O.)17. One of our most effective agencies for bringing about improved social and economic conditions and for co-ordinating British political, strategic andeconomic interests is the British Middle East Office, which was set up in 1945.Its tasks are to give expert guidance to,Middle East countries in economic and social matters, to make recommendations on political questions affecting theMiddle East as a whole and to give political advice to the Middle East defence -ordination Committee. The B.M.E.O. should receive every encouragement and possibly increases in staff.Communist Activities18. The above paragraphs deal largely with the creation of conditions inwhich Communist penetration will fail. Middle East Governments are slow to take the necessary action in this field, but are usually readier to deal withthe manifestations of Communist activities which come to their notice. Wecan and should give valuable assistance in this matter also both as regardspublicity and security measures.   We should at the same time be careful to37492 b2
watch for signs that reactionary Governments use anti-Communist measuresto repress genuinely progressive opposition.External Relations19. Arab Unity. We desire that Middle East countries should become increasingly strong and prosperous and should compose the quarrels and differ-ences which have in the past so weakened them. We do not wish to express an opinion about the form which Arab unity should take as between, e.g., theexisting Arab League, the proposals for the unity of the Fertile Crescent (Iraq,Syria, Lebanon and Jordan) or the Greater Syria plan (the unity of Syria andJordan). We are strongly opposed to the use of force by one Arab country against another to bring about changes of their relative status. But if closer relations between any or all of the Arab countries, leading even to some kindof union, grew up organically and constitutionally, by the free consent of the peoples concerned, and without hostile intentions against other Arab States,we should see no reason to oppose, this and, indeed, such a development mighthave advantages, though we should have to consider carefully how it affectedour treaty relationships. The Arab League has not been as beneficial as was hoped. Its main function has been as a forum for nationalist propaganda,though it may well have had some value as a safety-valve. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment cannot take any steps to bring it to an end but we should not regretits demise. If it continues in being we should hope it would concentrate more on social and economic problems.20. Israel. The developments in Palestine since the end of the Mandate,resulting in the emergence of the State of Israel, have been one of the most disturb-ing elements in Middle East policy. It is largely owing to them that the presentreview of our Middle East policy is being held. We must never under-ratp thepolitical and psychological preoccupation of all Arab Governments and peopleswith the Palestine question. They will, for instance, refuse to respond to ourguidance on social and economic matters if they find us differing too widely from them over Palestine. His Majesty&apos;s Government accept Israel as an establishedfact and intend to grant her de jure recognition at the earliest suitable moment.They regard it as a matter of high importance that she should be orientatedtowards the West and play her part in the defence of the Middle East againstCommunist penetration and Soviet aggression. For this purpose they will use their best endeavours to have friendly and mutually profitable relations with her.At the same time they are bound to have regard to their existing friendships andalliances with the Arab States, particularly as the latter are at present morewilling than Israel to commit themselves to the anti-Communist camp. It wouldbe too high a price to pay for the friendship of Israel to jeopardise, by estrangingthe Arabs, either the base in Egypt or Middle Eastern oil. Subject always tothese interests being safeguarded, His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to pro-mote not merely peace but friendly relations between Israel and the Arab States.They would see no objection to the development of normal trading relationsbetween Israel and her Arab neighbours on a basis of complete independence.But His Majesty&apos;s Government would not regard it as in their interest that Israelshould acquire more Arab territory without a quid pro quo or that she should carryher economic exchanges with the Arab States to the point of dominating themeconomically and so politically, and thus perhaps imposing her own ideas of neutrality on the Arab world. They would not lend their assistance to the f ur-therance of any such ambitions and would indeed support the Arab States in resisting them.21. This being our general policy, we should judge on their merits all ques-tions arising in our relations with Israel and we should be ready to take suchopportunities as occur of improving these relations in such ways as do notendanger our position in the rest of the Middle East and the Moslem world. Wedo not at present dispose of such influence with the Arabs, however, that we can safely press them to make friendly overtures to Israel.22. We should continue to co-operate as closely as possible with the UnitedStates Government and the Palestine Conciliation Commission of the united nations to bring about a final settlement of all Palestine questions, includingparticularly the Arab refugees, the territorial settlement, Jerusalem and Haifa.
Defence23. If progress is made in the tasks described above we can have some assurance that Russia will not gain marked success in the cold war in the middle east. It is necessary also to consider how we may best prevent Russian success in a shooting war ixi that area. There is no doubt whatever that the middle east must be defended, on account of its value as an offensive base, as a source!of oil and as a focal point of communications. The forces. of Middle EastGovernments will never be adequate tb make any appreciable contribution tothis task, though the Turkish forces and the Arab Legion will be able to play a useful role in the early stages. In order to enable our forces to undertakesuccessful offensive and defensive operations in the Middle East, it is necessaryto have bur main base in Egypt, the assurance that Turkey is both able and determined either to safeguard her neutrality or to impose effective delay oilRussian forces, adequate subsidiary strategic facilities in Jordan, Iraq andOyrehalca. and preferably some additional facilities in Saudi Arabia, Syriaand the Lebaribii. It will also be essential iii time of war for our forces to beable to operate in and through Israel, We do not at present desire strategicfacilities in Israel in peace-time, largely, because of the political pressure tbwhich this might expose us. Brit the method of obtaining access to ports;airfields and communications in Israel must be constantly reviewed. It ispossible that it may be easier for the United States than for the United kingdom to obtain the necessary agreement from Israel., 24. Middle, East Pact. In order to be assured of the above facilities, ourultimate object must, be to. see the whole Middle East area covered by a systemof defence agreements. Thought is being given to the desirability of, a generalMiddle East Pact complementary to the Atlantic Pact. But it is unlikely thatthe United States would be willing to join in such a;pact in the near future, andwithout United States participation it.would be of doubtful value.. Moreover,the prospect of the Arab,countries and Israel joining together,in such,a pactis remote. Finally^ a Middle East pact qh the lines of the Atlantic Pact wouldnot assure us of the strategic facilities which we possess or require. , We should,therefore, still wish to retain.and reinforce ,our bilateral agreements. If, theArab States wished, however, we should not object to some kind of general Arab1League endorsement of bilateral agreements..25. Supply of A rms- In attempting tb consolidate our strategic positionand to build up a defence system throughout the Middle East, we shall constantlybe faced with pressing requests from Middle East Governments for extensivesupplies of war material. In some cases we have treaty obligations to make these supplies. Some of these requirements may be unrealistic and it may sometimesbe better for the Governments concerned to spend more oh. economic development and less on arms. But the building up of independent armed forces is a matter to which Middle East States attach such prime importance that we miist be careful to recognise it in all our dealings with them. If they cannot get whatthey want from us, they will certainly turn to other sources of supply, e.g.,particularly Czechoslovakia. Our task must be to obtain the fullest arid mostdefinite statements of requirements of Middle. East countries and at the sametime to examine ways and means of meeting these requirements in the UnitedKingdom, including examination of the possibility of new production.26. United States Strategic Facilities. The United States has airfields at Dhahrari in Saudi Arabia and at Mellaha in Tripolitania, She also wishes to obtain a fighter base. The strategic presence of the United States in theMiddleEast is to our advantage. In time of war action should be on an Anglo-Americanbasis.Turkey27.. Turkey sits astride the entrance to the road along which Soviet forces would have to advance in order to reach the Canal, and it is therefore very important that the Turks should be in a situation to delay such an advance aslong as possible. The Americans have taken over from us the main burden ofarmingand training the Turks, though we still supply instructors, and.given time;the Turkish army inight.be made capable of major defensive: operations.But it is never likely to be so strong as to make it worth our while that Turkey37492 b 3
should come into a war on our side if she had not been attacked. Our treaty of alliance with the Turks, which requires us to come to their aid if they are attackedbut does not require them to come to our aid if we are independently involvedin war with Russia, is therefore not at all disadvantageous to us though prima facie one-sided. The Turks set great store by this treaty, whose validity we haverecently reaffirmed, and it helps to keep up their morale in face of Russian threats.We should continue to contribute what help we can to the modernisation of theTurkish armed forces and we should continue to bolster Turkish resistance to russian encroachments by moral and political support.Anglo-American Co-operation28. Co-operation between London and Washington in regard to the middle east is extremely close. Divergence of policy over Palestine has now been verylargely narrowed. In other matters there is virtual agreement, which is perhapscloser than in regard to any other area. Now that our differences over Palestinehave been largely removed and, we nope, will not recur, it is our primary taskto convince the Americans of the importance of a constructive Middle East policy on the lines of the present paper in the fields of defence, resistance to Communistpenetration, economic development and social reform, and by constant co-operation in London, Washington and in the field to give practical effect to this programme by joint or concerted action. The United States do not wish to supplant our special political position in the Middle East. Although a large material contribu-tion both for defence and economic development ought to come from them, wehave so much greater experience and expertise that we can justifiably claim tomaintain this special position even if there are limits on our own materialcontribution.Calls on His Majesty&apos;s Government29. The need of Middle East countries for the provision of external financefrom outside sources in order to carry out their development projects has been referred to in paragraph 15 above. Their need for guidance and technical advice from outside is no less great. If these are not provided by the West, they maysooner or later be provided by Russia. In these circumstances His Majesty&apos;governments first task is to decide, in the light of the Middle East projectsunder examination and of various other competing claims, what are the general lines of economic development in the Middle East which they can support and encourage and, secondly, what is the nature and extent of possible UnitedKingdom assistance. Our contribution may be one or all of the following :  (1) allocation of United Kingdom production;(2) support for loan applications by Middle East Governments to the Inter-national Bank;(3) larger sterling releases;(4) direct cash loans;(5) technical assistance.Our present very limited resources will make it difficult for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to consider any direct financial advance save in exceptional circum-stances. (In the case of Iraq, for instance, the internal financial situation is such that pressure for a direct cash loan from His Majesty&apos;s Government seems boundto increase, and in the case of Jordan the country&apos;s financial resources are solimited that it has even been found necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government toprovide a credit for internal expenditure.) The claims on available resources areworld-wide. Our own resources are very limited. The decision will thereforebe difficult. But even in advance of any further consideration one point isperfectly clear. If we have to refuse all participation in Middle East economic development, not only shall we lose our own position and influence there, butthis will have a disastrous result for our political, strategic and social objectives,since in that case either development would not take place at all or it would takeplace under other and dangerous auspices.Current liabilities of His Majesty&apos;s Government30. Apart from the question of participation in general economic develop-ment in the Middle East, there are a number of current liabilities which HisMajesty&apos;s Government have undertaken in the course of day to day dealings
with the Middle East or which it is being recommended that they should under-take. The most important of these, so far as can at present be foreseen, are : (a) Jordan. Our present annual contribution to Jordan in the form of asubvention to the Arab Legion is  3^ millions. This is based on a force of 7,000 men. The Chiefs of Staff consider that the size of force required to defend Jordan is 25,000. This would probablyinvolve an increase in our annual subvention to  5^ millions.(6) Cyrenaica. Cyrenaica at present receives a grant in aid of some f-fil-1 millions per annum. The future grant in aid required bythe territory is hard to estimate because the territory&apos;s economy will receive considerable help from the sums to be expended on military installations, which, of course, are a charge on His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, and by means of which some employment might be found forArab refugees.(c) Arab Refugees. In 1948^49 His Majesty&apos;s Government contributed 1,100,000 to the relief of Arab refugees. The Foreign Office have recommended that in 1949-50 His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldbe willing to make a further contribution for temporary relief whichmight be in the neighbourhood of  1,000,000. We are also making an interest-free loan of  1,000,000 to Jordan to assist in the permanent settlement of Arab refugees.id) Military Mission and Civil Air Training Mission in Saudi Arabia. The present cost of these Missions is about  90,000 a year.(e) Levy force in the Persian Gulf. A recommendation will shortly be madefor the establishment of a small local force under British command in the Trucial Coast area of the Persian Gulf with the primary objectof stopping the trade in slaves, which has recently increased. A very rough estimate of the cost is  40,000 a year.(/) Provision of Experts. Foreign experts of the necessary calibre canonly be obtained if salaries and conditions of service are such as to attract first-class men. Middle East Governments cannot alwaysafford to pay adequate salaries, in which case it may be impossibleto appoint the right men unless some means can be found to make upthe difference. Arrangements are also required to ensure that Britishexperts and others who take service in a Middle East country do notsuffer for having done so on their return to the, United Kingdom,and it is essential to have an efficient organisation in the UnitedKingdom for the recruitment of experts.ig) Training. His Majesty&apos;s Government could usefully extend facilitiesfree or at reduced rates for technical training either in the middle east or in the United Kingdom.Foreign Office, London, S. W. 1,ZOth July, 1949.
ANNEXSome of the Specific Tasks of British Policy in individual Middle EastCountriesEgypt.(1) The establishment of a stable Government which, while friendly to thiscountry, is more representative of Egyptian opinion than any of the previousPalace Cabinets. Only such a Government will be in a position to tackle the vastsocial and economic problems facing Egypt and to reach a settlement on out-standing political issues with His Majesty&apos;s Government.(2) Progressive social reform and economic development. The principaleconomic project is the development of the Nile Waters, without which Egyptwill be unable to support her growing population. Without her co-operation,moreover, economic and social development would be retarded in the Sudan and uganda.(3) The settlement of the Treaty issue and the question of the status of theSudan. The first problem is much the most important and it is possible thatthe question of the Sudan can be left dormant for the time being.Some progress towards the achievement of all these three aims has been made.A Government of national union, at any rate for the duration of the elections,has been created. The Egyptian Government have in principle agreed toco-operate in both the Equatorial and the Blue Nile schemes. Technical militarytalks have progressed extremely well so far and offer at any rate a chance of amore permanent modus vivendi giving us the facilities we need to meet the threat of war in the Middle East.IraqEstablishment of financial stability.Reform of the Administration.Broader political basis for the regime.Active progress with economic development through an Economic Develop-ment Board, accompanied by the necessary social reform under the guidance ofa British labour expert.Resumption of full supply of war material.When some progress has been made with the above, the question of a new defence Agreement can be reviewed.Discouragement of provocative measures against other Arab States.Re-opening of Haifa pipeline.Saudi ArabiaSettlement of eastern and southern frontiers.Continuance of efforts to improve relations with Jordan and Iraq.Continued evidence of British interest through, eg., Military Mission, civil air Training Mission, Reconnaissance Mission and the supply of arms.Financial guidance should be given where possible but there is not muchhope of early social progress.   Commercial opportunities should be developed.JordanMaintain the viability of Jordan, with particular reference to refugees.Extension of Arab Legion to fulfil the tasks laid down for it bv the Chiefsof Staff. 3Early absorption of Arab Palestine with extension of Anglo-JordanianTreaty. &amp;Maintenance of existing relatively satisfactory social conditions.LebanonIntensification of anti-Communist measures with the help of British securityexpert.Expedite establishment of social insurance scheme and other socialmeasures.
Lebanese overtures with regard to a defence treaty should be kept in playwithout definite commitments for the time being.Possible action by Lebanese Government to mediate between rival groups of Arab States.SyriaThe new regime should be given such guidance and technical assistance as ispossible.War material should be supplied.Overtures with regard to a Treaty should be met in the first instance by thedispatch of the proposed British Reconnaissance Mission to study sites forairfields.Economic development of the Gezira, with particular reference to refugeeresettlement. Improvement of relations with Jordan and Iraq, possibly assisted by assurances of His Majesty&apos;s Governments friendly intentions.Persian GulfFinancial guidance, particularly to Kuwait about the best use of oil revenues.Similar guidance to other states as their oil revenues increase.Local administration should be continually reminded, as may be appropriate,of the need for social progress and equitable distribution of wea. Ith.Emphasis to be laid on education.The slave trade must be stopped.A Levy Force should be created for this purpose in the Trucial Coast.IsraelEstablishment of normal friendly relations with the United Kingdom.Efforts to consolidate israels western orientation.Great care to be exercised about the role of Israel in the Middle East.Early settlement of outstanding Palestine questions, including particularlymaximum Israeli contribution to refugees.Reopening of Haifa refinery.
