(49) 53rd Conclusions,Minute 1) my colleagues will recall we discussed our non-discriminationobligations. I am circulating for information a note prepared by officials, partly because I think my colleagues will find it a useful memorandum on the non-discrimination point, but mainly because I think it will be of use in summarising the development of Anglo-American relations in the field of commercial policy since the end of the war.H. W.Board of Trade, Millbank, S.W. 1,12th September, 1949.THE  FUTURE  OF MULTILATERAL  international economic CO-operation. The nature and causes of the present world balance of payments situation,and the possible major remedies which might be applied, are not dealt with inthis paper. Its object is to examine the effect of that situation on the plans formultilateral international co-operation in the field of payments and (moreparticularly) trade which have been worked out as a result of joint Anglo-American initiative.2. After a long and arduous series of private United Kingdom-United Statesdiscussions, we and the United States put forward at the end of the war a numberof projects amounting to a rough blue-print for a new and saner era in the conductof economic policy throughout the world.  Its keystones were :-(i) The United States Loan. This big injection of dollars into the heart of world trade, supplemented (it was hoped) by substantial reconstruc-tion loans to Europe through the Export-Import Bank, was intendedto prime the pump and thus get dollars circulating on a scale sufficientto restore the multilateral flow of currencies ana trade on a basis ofconvertibility and non-discrimination. The pump once primed, any subsequent smaller-scale fluctuations could be dealt with through theInternational Bank and the International Monetary Fund (I.M.E.).(ii) The Bank. -Convertibility and confidence once restored, this, it was hoped, would stimulate and canalise more effectively than ever beforethe international capital flow, primarily from the United States,needed to compensate for the long-term unbalance between the dollarand non-dollar worlds and finance the economic development in thenon-dollar world necessary to correct this unbalance.Copy No.
(iii) The International Monetary Fund. This would provide a stabilisationpool to cover short-term fluctuations in international payments on current account, in return for which countries would accept come degree of international control or influence with regard to theirexchange rates and the convertibility of their currencies.(iv) The International Trade Organisation. The financial foundations thuslaid, the Intetnational Trade Organisation (I.T.O.) could be createdas an international club directed to the reduction of trade barriersand the avoidance of discrimination (i.e., the optimum internationaldivision of labour), the maintenance of a high and steadily growinglevel of demand, and of adequate stability for primary commodity prices (i.e., the avoidance of slumps), and the encouragement of sound economic development (ie., ensuring that the long-term changes inthe pattern of world production are in the right direction, and thatthe consequent problems of adjustment are properly foreseen andhandled). ,     &apos;To these, when it became evident that the existing pump-priming was inadequate, and, in particular, that the burden of reconstruction in western europe was far greater than originally envisaged, was added the further pump-priming of-(v) European Recovery Programme aid.3. These five projects amounted, in effect, to a programme under which theUnited States made a very large contribution in dollars to post-war recovery,seeking in return certain benefits mainly guarantees of action by ourselves andothers to move quickly towards the multilateral system which it is our commonobjective to rebuild. Thus, under the Loan Agreement, we undertook to makesterling convertible by July 1947, to attempt to secure satisfactory sterling balancesettlements and refrain &quot;(in general) from discrimination against the UnitedStates in our import restrictions; and it was an implied condition of the Agree-inent that we should join the I.M.F. and join with the United States in furtheringthe I.T.O. project which we and they had worked out during the Loan Agreementdiscussions. Under the I.M.F. A greement, member countries are required not to change their exchange rates without T.M.F. concurrence, and to maintain con-vertibility (except where I.M.F. permits otherwise) once the post-war transition period is over; they are allowed to keep their existing exchange controls during a post-war transition period of undefined length, subject, however, to the right ofthe Fund after March 1952 to require them to desist. Under the I.T.O. Charter,member countries are required to enter into negotiations for &quot; the reduction of thegeneral level of tariffs and the elimination of preferences ......on a reciprocaland mutually advantageous basis,&quot; and to observe a modified form of non-discrimination (dealt with more fully below); the first rounds of tariff negotiationscontemplated in the Charter have already been carried out (at Geneva in 1947and in Annecy this summer), and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(G.A.T.T.), which incorporates their results and is at present in the stage of provisional application, also includes non-discrimination rules identical withthose of the Charter.4. United States aid to post-war world reconstruction has thus been tiedto three major strings action towards convertibility and non-discrimination and towards the reduction of tariffs combined with the &quot;elimination &quot; of imperial preference. Action towards convertibility, non-discrimination and the reductionof tariffs is in pursuance of common objectives. Action towards the &quot; elimination -tion &quot; of Imperial Preference is a concession to United States political views which, we frankly consider unjustified; but we have secured agreement withthe United States that we are required to reduce or eliminate preferences onlyto the extent that others offer us a fully satisfactory quid pro quo in tariff reductions and are not seeking to go back on our bargain.o.   At the same time as insisting pn these strings, the United states authorities have conceded one safeguard, viz., the &quot;scarce currency&quot; clause.. It was agreed at an early stage of the discussions leading to the formation ofthe I.M.F. that some means should be found to bring pressure to bear on countries whose policies led to their having a persistently favourable balance of payments,
to encourage them to rectify this tendency. This led to the evolution of the&quot;scarce currency&quot; clause (Article VII of I.M.F.), whereby, if a country&apos;scurrency becomes scarce to a point which threatens I.M.F.&apos;s ability to supply itto other countries, it may be formally declared scarce and rationed out by I.M.F.to its members. This automatically gives countries the right to apply exchange restrictions to the scarce currency; and there are specific let-outs both inSection 9 and in the G.A.T.T. I.T.O. non-discrimination rules giving very widefreedom for open discrimination against the United States if the dollar is in factdeclared scarce.6. &quot;Why is it that the results of this post-war economic planning have been so relatively disappointing? The major reason is obvious-the inherent size ofthe world&apos;s post-war reconstruction problem has been consistently under-estimated, and has been further increased by the split between the Russian andthe free world. The pump needed far more priming than we thought; and,though the contribution the United States have made to priming it has beenunprecedently large, it has, through no fault of theirs, proved inadequate. Butan important contributory factor to the disappointment created, and in come degree to the inadequate practical results achieved, has been the consistenttendency of the United States to expect too large or too quick a return for the contribution they have felt able to make, and in some cases to require of countriesdefinite commitments or time-schedules which have in fact proved unattainable.Thus, for example : (i) The amount of the 1945 Loan was $3f billion as against our original estimate that we needed, preferably by way of gift, about $6 billion.(ii) As part of the price of this, we were required to undertake, withina fixed period of one year from ratification of the Loan Agreement,the premature 1947 experiment in convertibility which, in fact,resulted in the wasteful dissipation (e.g., in imports of United Statesluxuries into Belgium) of a substantial part of the loan which would otherwise have been available for expenditure on reconstruction.(iii) We were further required to give the non-discrimination undertaking in Section 9 of the Loan Agreement. . This was conceived by theUnited States authorities as requiring us merely to give them theirfair share of the benefit of the increased purchasing made possible bythe Loan, on the assumption that the Loan would in fact be sufficientto tide us over the immediate post-war reconstruction period; andwe had to accept it, despite some doubts on this assumption. On this assumption, it was only a paper concession, as it represented no more. than what we would have readily done of our own free-will. On thecontrary assumption, which has in fact proved true, of severe dollarshortage, Section 9 makes complete nonsense; since, as the UnitedStates authorities have readily recognised, we cannot be expected to gowithout essential non-dollar supplies in the name of non-discrimina-tion, we have been faced with the alternative of formally throwingSection 9 overboard (which the United States have so far been anxiousto avoid), or of putting up with the acquiescence of the United states administration a somewhat disengenuous facade (which is now an obvious sham) of compliance with it. It has, in fact, done the UnitedStates no good, and has served only to cause us and them a good dealof anxiety, to threaten us both with recriminations from United Statesexporters which would serve only to bedevil United Kingdom-UnitedStates political relations, and to hold up our scheme, which could do alot of real good, to free intra-European trade by import licensingrelaxations.(iv) United States policy over the I.M.F. has consistently been too rigidand cautious. First, the size of the Fund was cut down, as a resultof the discussions with the United States in 1944, considerably below what was originally contemplated in our &quot; Clearing Union &quot; proposals(though it is not this which has hitherto rendered the Fund of suchlittle value). The Fund was not intended (Article XlV(l)) to financereconstruction or war debts; but this cutting-down is not withoutsignificance as a symptom of United States caution.  More important,Owing to Russia&apos;s not joiningb 2
the Fund, the weighted voting system has given the United States30 per cent, of the total votes, i.&apos;e., virtually complete control overthe Fund&apos;s decisions. This has been used, especially of late, to bring pressure on other members of the Fund far beyond what was intendedby the Fund&apos;s Articles. The provisions of Article XIV, allowingcountries to &quot; maintain and adapt to changing circumstances&quot; theirexisting exchange controls in the post-war transition period, subjectto the Fund&apos;s right to pull them up &quot; in exceptional circumstances,&quot;have been read by the United States to mean that countries may main-tain their exchange controls, but may adapt them to new circumstanceswith the Fun&amp;s prior approval; this despite Article XIV(5), whichrecognises the difficulties of post-war adjustment and requires memberlegitimacy of what they are doing. Similarly, the United -states representatives in the Fund have of late been seeking to establishcriteria, for which the Articles of the Fund give no justification, whichcountries would be required to meet in regard to the acceptability oftheir exchange rate and of their general financial policy before theycould exercise their drawing rights.This is, in fact, just the same kind of administrative narrowingof other countries&apos; rights which United States representatives have sought also in the I.T.O. field over non-discrimination. It is a perfectlynatural kind of chiselling deriving from impatience; and the UnitedStates may understandably regard our resistance to it as chiselling inthe reverse direction. Which attitude is right on the wording of therules may be arguable (though we feel that United States lawyershave argued too far); but what matters is which attitude conformsto the needs of the.world as it is.1 particular, United States policy in the Fund has been directed,though possibly without this specific intent, to making the &quot; scarce currency &quot;&apos; clause a dead letter. We thought originally that this clausemight give some real protection against a dollar shortage; indeed,Lord Keynes&apos; conviction that this was so was one of the main factors which led His Majesty&apos;s Government and Parliament to accept the LoanAgreement.  Once the clause comes into operation, it gives wide free-dom for discriminatory exchange and trade controls against the scarce currency; and there is then real pressure on the country concerned toplay its full part in putting the scarcity right, e.g., by drastic actionsuch as we want the United States to take to stimulate imports.   Inpractice, however, the clause has so far been completely ineffective.This is due to the attitude of the United States in the Fund, combined with the structure of the quotas.   The clause operates only &quot;if it is becoming evident to the Fund that the demand for a members&apos; currencyseriously threatens the Fund&apos;s ability to supply that currency.&quot;   Ifthese words are read in a spirit of common sense, they are clearly truenow; obviously dollars are so scarce that the Fund cannot supply them on the scale on which other countries need them.  The United States,however, has taken the line not only of interpreting the clause in an arrow technical sense but of removing any chance it has of operating.Their conception appears to be that it should operate only when theFund is unable to supply dollars against the limited annual drawingrights of other countries. Since the United States quota is 30 per cent,of the total of quotas in the Fund, and countries may not draw more from the Fund annually than 25 per cent, of their quotas, it wouldtake about two years with every other member of the Fund drawingUnited States dollars as fast as possible before the dollar could becometechnically &quot; scarce &quot; in this sense.  To make matters worse, however,the United States have insisted on a Fund ruling which debars recipientsfrom E.E.P. aid from drawing United States dollars from the Fund;in this way, the possibility of the &quot; scarce currency &quot; clause operatinghas been completely banished to the remote future.  This may not havebeen the intention; but the result is that, in a world of acute dollarscarcity, the &quot;scarce currency&quot; clause, which would otherwise dealautomatically with the discrimination difficulties dealt with below, isprevented from working.countriesreasonable doubt about the
7. This United States attitude has been conspicuous also in the discussions with I.T.O.-G.A.T.T. project, where non-discrimination has been a leading topic.Throughout these, there has been the greatest difficulty in reconciling UnitedKingdom and United States points of view United States pressure for tightcontrol over discrimination and United Kingdom desire for latitude. Thus, when we had secured in the evolution of&quot; the Original 1945 &apos;&apos; Commercial PolicyProposals&quot; an understanding that there should be reasonable latitude for dis-crimination in the post-war period, the United States in the concurrent LoanAgreement discussions insisted on forcing Section 9 on us. At the first sessionof the Preparatory Committee on the I.T.O. project (London, 1946) we, beingbound by Section 9 and still hopeful of being able to observe convertibility andreal non-discrimination, made the mistake of going somewhat too far in agreeing to rules which would have given the I.T.O. a rather tight control over discrimina-tion. When, at the next stage (Geneva, 1947), we foresaw conditions calling forwider latitude, we had great difficulty in persuading the United States to acceptsomewhat more flexible rules on the lines of those now incorporated in the charter and G.A.T.T. as the &quot; Geneva option.&quot; These were written into both the charter and G.A.T.T.; then, as the nature of the dollar crisis became clearer and no one could promise any degree of non-discrimination until it was known whetherMarshall aid would become a reality, the United States reluctantly agreed to a clause in G.A.T.T. (but not the draft Charter) completely suspending the non-discrimination rules for the period until the end of 1948, with provision for apossible extension.At the beginning of the Havana Conference, we proposed on strongMinisterial instructions the extension of this period of suspense until the endof 1952. This the United States representatives flatly rejected; over and above this, they put forward novel and narrow interpretations of the non-discriminationrules agreed at Geneva which caused a large number of European countries to insist,that they could not now accept these rules. To meet this, the United Statesproposed a completely new set of rules, which eventually became the &apos;&apos; Havanaoption,&quot; allowing countries to &quot; maintain and adapt &quot; their existing discrimina-tory measures, on the analogy of I.M.F. Article XIV. This we could not accept,as our existing discrimination was closely circumscribed by Section 9; eventually,after extreme difficulties with the United States delegation, a compromise waspatched up under which countries were allowed to choose between the &quot; Havanaoption&quot; rules and a clarified version (&quot;the Geneva option&quot;) of the previousGeneva text. This we accepted, making, however, at the final Plenary the state-ment that we could do so only with the intention of making full use of thelatitude provided by the rules. At Annecy, however, when the question of SouthAfrica&apos;s new import restrictions system came up, we encountered in full force the usual United States resistance to reasonably wide interpretation of the rules and pressure for narrowing them down by interpretative or procedural devices.(This was backed up by the representatives of the I.M.F. who have through-out the discussions on the I.T.O. project used every endeavour to establish thatI.M.F. should play a leading role in the interpretation and application of theI.T.O. non-discrimination rules.)8. The moral of this long history is abundantly clear. So far the combinedefforts of the United States, the sterling area and other countries to get theformer system of convertibility and non-discrimination going again have notbeen successful. As to the basic reasons for this lack of success, it may be saidthat: (i) The primary cause is that the essential condition for the working ofthis system, viz., the-existence of an approximate condition of balance in world production and trade, is lacking. Given this approximatebalance, the multilateral flow of trade and payments can function asan automatic regulator to ensure exact balance and to effect the constant adjustments in production and trade throughout the worldnecessary to maintain this balance. But the fact is that the necessaryapproximate balance has never really existed since 1914. This is due in part to the failure of the major non-dollar countries to achieve a pattern and value of production in which their external trade is inoverall balance, so that their balance of payments can be maintainedwithout abnormally heavy United States investment or United Statesgifts and loans; but immeasurably the main factor has been the deter-
urination of the United States (largely unconscious), to maintain a verylarge favourable balance,of trade. The 1914-18 war first threw the multilateral system but of balance, by dealing ah immehse Blow ph. the productive capacity arid the gold reserves and foreign investments.-ofEurope, and at the same time stimulating ah equally inunerise develop-ment of production in the United States. After 1918, the UnitedStates was not unnaturally reluctant to see the balance restoredthrough a large increase in her imports or a decrease in her exports;her balance of payments was therefore maintained, first by gifts, and loans for post-war reconstruction in Europe, and later by privateoverseas investment on a vast scale. The cessation of this investriientfrom 1929 onward revealed clearly the lack of real balance in world trade; hence the economic convulsions of the early &apos;30s, after whichpartial equilibrium was slowly recovered only by major economicadjustment (with political consequences, we, all know), and by a,eori-siderable measure of biiateralisiri in world trade. The economic effects of the second. World War repeated the pattern of 1914-18, but chancellor even moi-e immehse senile; and it is essentially with the.resultantunbalance that we are all trying to cope. \y*e are in trouble becausethe.pattern of world production is right out of balance. The resultspf this can be masked as long, as the United States are prepared to finance their huge favourable balance of trade by loans and gifts-andwe must on no account underrate the world&apos;s need-for these, loans andgifts after the war and the far-sighted generosity which suppliedthem; but in so far as the flow of United States aid is reduced as time goes on, the lack of real balance becomes evident and has to be overcome by a decrease in United States exports or an increase inUnited States imports. ( Tb achieve a real balance is, a task whosemagnitude has been, consistently underrated; the primary need now isto recognise and tackle it-and to realise that, until it has been carriedout, there will remain a state of imbalance.   ,(ii) As long as, this unbalance remains, convertibility and non-discriminationjust will not work. Nbri-discrimination follows from convertibility,and without it is nonsense. Convertibility will not work until thereis and is known to be an approximate state of balance, so that the reserves of the noh1dollar world, i.e., in effect, the reserves of the sterling area, are adequate tb take the strain of a plunge into con-yertibility. And here it must be remembered that reserves whichwould fee adequate to take the day-to-day strain, of maintaining an existing, state of convertibility would not be adequate, tp; initiateconvertibility at one stroke; for this one needs reserves which areat the same tiriie large enough to take the strain of any conversionresultihg from lack of confidence in pne&apos;s ability to maintainconvertibility, and to create sufficient confidence to ensure that thereis not too much conversion. Banks in normal operation need, only a relatively small margin of cash reserve; but a bank which is reopeningafter a run on it needs to have, arid tb be known to have, a verylarge cash reserve indeed. If we are to return to convertibility and non-discrimination, we must be allowed-unless the United States areprepared to give us virtually unlimited backing-to do so iri our owntime. Indeed, it is fair to say that premature United States insistence* on convertibility and non-discrimiriation as a condition of aid aswitness the 1947 experiment. in convertibility has to some extentforced us.to dissipate this aid and has thus postponed the day when,,,,      we can return to the full multilateralism which we and they desire.(iii) The United States may claim that part of the trouble is due to our own, failure to improve our efficiency and productivity rapidly enough, andto the general internal policies of His Majesty&apos;s Government.To lay undue stress on this is to miss the main point, e.g., thatwe are faced with a world-wide state of unbalance, dUe iri considerable part to failure ori the part of the United States to adopt a sufficientlyliberal import policy, and which happens to have becdirie apparent inthe United Kingdom through its position as the repository of themain monetary reserve of the non-dollar world.   Nevertheless, it is
a criticism which we must meet in a spirit of readiness to examine themeans by which we can do better. As against this, we can fairly point to the very substantial achievements in post-war reconstruction,of our country, made by a people which has borne for ten years the burdenof our unprecedentedly large per capita effort of war-making and war production under fire, and for whom after this effort it was essential,if fundamental social upheavals were to be avoided, to provide in alarge degree (though the exact degree may be a matter of political controversy) improved social services and working conditions.The essence of the situation, in short, is that we are faced with a state ofunbalance which will take long and arduous efforts on the part both of the UnitedStates and of the non-dollar world to overcome; and until this is done, the multi-lateral system cannot be got once again into full operation. A great effort and agreat measure of patience are called for; and the less there is of either, the morethere will have to be of the other.9. The most immediate consequence of this arises in regard to non-discrimination -nation, and particularly in regard to our attitude towards the I.T.O. Charter and .A.T.T. The present position is that action throughout the world on putting the charter into effect is waiting on the decision of the United States; the Adminis-tration had hoped to get the Charter, which they are continuing to back strongly,through Congress this summer, but Congressional consideration has been deferredowing to the congested timetable until the next session, when it cannot be regardedas by any means certain that Congress will approve ratification of the Charter.Meanwhile, we, the United States and most other major trading countries are continuing to apply the G.A.T.T., which contains non-discrimination rulesidentical with those of the Charter, on the provisional basis, i.e., with the right towithdraw on two months&apos; notice. His Majesty&apos;s Government stated at the endof the Havana Conference (March 1948) that they hoped in due course, if circum-stances were then favourable, to recommend the Charter to Parliament, but havetaken no final decision on the matter. Whether we finally ratify the G.A.T.T.must of course depend on whether we ratify the Charter; the two instruments form part of the whole I.T.O. project. On the assumption, therefore, that Congresswill ratify the Charter (if not, we all have to reconsider our commercial policyab initio), we shall be faced before long with the decision whether or not ourselves to ratify. If we do so all the other leading trading nations except Russia and theArgentine are likely to follow suit, if not, the I.T.O. project will certainly be killedoutright. &apos;10. The primary factor in our decision must clearly be whether or not we cancommit ourselves, and, equally important, encourage other countries, especially those of the Commonwealth, to commit themselves, to abide for at least the next three or four years by the modified non-discrimination rules of the Charter and .A.T.T. If the outcome of the Washington discussions is so highly encouragingas to remove effectively our current anxieties about the world balance of paymentssituation there seems no reason why we should not go forward with the I.T.O.project; what we have to consider is what we should do if the outcome is not sohighly encouraging.11 The I.T.O. non-discrimination rules have been analysed in detail in other papers (distributed to officials). That, analysis makes it clear that both sets ofrules, the &quot; Geneva option &quot; by which in particular we, Canada, South Africa and ceylon are governed, and the &quot; Havana option &quot; rules which govern virtually allother countries (see paragraph 7 above), are somewhat ill-defined, and dependgreatly on interpretation in the case of the &quot; Geneva option &quot; the interpretation of how far particular bilateral arrangements are justified by the concent ofexchanges of &quot; additional imports &quot; and in the case of the &quot; Havana option &quot; theinterpretation of how far the I.T.O. are entitled to press countries to give up theirdiscriminatory measures as balance of payments conditions improve. It is im-possible to tell in advance how much latitude the rules would allow in practice;everything depends on the spirit in which I.T.O. would interpret them and inthis connection it must be remembered that I.T.O. would operate on a one-countryone-vote basis &quot;____and that the United States (though it would not have the pre-ponderant influence assured to it in the I.M.F. by the weighted voting system
might be able, through, e.g., its political pull with the numerous small Latin-American countries and (until 1951 at least) the recipients of E.E.P. aid, to exer-cise a very powerful influence.&quot;   What is quite clear is that (a) The discrimination in South Africa&apos;s import restrictions consequent onthe proposed gold guarantee arrangement, though entirely justifiableon grounds of necessity, is exceedingly difficult to justify under theterms of the &quot; Geneva option &quot; rules. Some sort of technical justifi-cation could be devised; but unless their attitude can be fundamentallychanged, the United States (who have objected strongly at Annecy tothe import restriction system previously proposed before the goldguarantee arrangement, which would make the discrimination muchmore severe) are likely to regard the South African import restrictionsas going so far beyond what the rules should allow as to make itimpossible to enforce the rules in any future case.(b) While we cannot at present foresee any other comparable case, we maybe compelled,, if the dollar crisis is not overcome, to go in for other arrangements to protect our position which would go well outside anyfair interpretation of the rules. The rules, in short, were devised tomeet a situation in which the world dollar situation is improvingslowly but steadily; this can hardly apply to-times like the present.(c) Nothing that has happened so far could encourage us to hope that theUnited States Government would agree to a really wide interpretation of the rules, or would be politically able to do so even if they so desired.12. It would seem to follow inevitably that we cannot bind ourselves, and encourage others to bind themselves, to observe these rules in present circum-stances. We have had ample experience over the Loan Agreement provisions,both about convertibility and about non-discrimination, of taking on reluctantlyobligations which we could carry out only if highly favourable expectations werefulfilled; we have reached a stage where we feel it difficult if not impossible to regard it as honest to take on further non-discrimination obligations.13. What therefore is to be done ? It would be political folly of a high orderto jettison the whole I.T.O. project, on which we, the United States, and the restof the free world have worked so long and pinned, such hopes, because of this one serious but not insuperable difficulty. The success of so many countries ingoing so far as to agree on the Charter the most ambitious plan for international economic co-operation ever thrashed out between Governments has been, in thetroubled times of the last four years, a very real sign of hope to progressive and constructive opinion throughout the free world; to jettison it would be tragic.14. The only solution we can see is the one we put forward at Havana, andwhich the United States then rejected, of a suspension of non-discrimination rules for a period of, say, two or three years, with provision for subsequent extensionif need be. Meanwhile, we would be ready to see it provided (subject to agreement on an appropriate formula) that the I.T.O. should have some degree of power tocall a halt to discrimination which could not be justified on grounds of common-sense and necessity, and that discrimination should throughout be subject to study,discussion and review but not prohibition by the I.T.O. On this basis, wewould be enabled to recommend acceptance of the Charter, and with real confidence.15.   Suspension might be effected in several different ways, viz. :-(i) Ad hoc agreement to this end, which, if we and the United States were agreed on this, could be negotiated with other countries concerned.(ii) An agreement recognising (as is already recognised in regard to theUnited Kingdom-Colonies monetary area) that the sterling area is tobe regarded as a single monetary unit within which trade should nothave to be restricted on non-disdrimination grounds would probablygo far enough to meet us, if the United States could be brought to agreeto it.(iii) Despite the technical obstacles to the application of the I.M.F. scarce currency clause, it might be possible for I.M.F. to take action whichwould be equivalent to this.
16. To get the United States to accept this is a tall order, but we havereached a stage at which a conflict of outlooks in this field is coming toa head, and must be resolved. &quot;We entirely agree with the United States on objec-tives we ourselves cannot live for ever in a world of bilateralism but we differas to the pace at which we can move towards multilateralism. We must seek to convince them on the highest level that patience is essential. For this, we havethe following1 arguments : (i) Non-discrimination must follow convertibility, not precede it.   In a world where we are not able, as we were before the war, to convertour favourable balances of trade with non-dollar countries into dollars to finance our trade with the United States, non-discrimination isnonsense. If we cannot convert our favourable balances, we mustspend them where they are spendable; if we cannot afford to pay for goods which we need and others are anxious to sell except in inconvert-ible sterling, i.e., in our goods, we must pay in sterling. All thisinevitably means discrimination.(ii) In a world where one currency is acutely scarce, non-discrimination,in fact, entails a vicious circle of contractionism. It means that Ais prevented from buying goods from B because he cannot afford to buy similar goods from G; if he accordingly cuts down his imports and so on.(iii) Pressure on one part of the sterling area not to discriminate defeatsits own end, for it increases the total amount of discrimination in theworld. The pooling of dollars by the sterling area may offend UnitedStates prejudices, but it represents a rough and ready way of allocat-ing dollars among several major countries according to their needs.To interfere with this allocation according to need results only in increased dollar expenditure by one sterling area country which is relatively better off for dollars at the cost of an equal increase in the dollar expenditure of another country which is relatively worse off,and this decrease in the worse^ff country necessitates more discrimina-tion than that which is avoided in the better off one.(iv) The root fact is that the United States can only have an export surplus to the extent it finances it by loans or gifts. If the supply of dollars to the non-dollar world falls, United States exports must fallcorrespondingly; the only question is how the adjustment is to beeffected. If, while the underlying disequilibrium persists, the UnitedStates press successfully for non-discrimination or too littlediscrimination in one country, all they do is to shift the incidence of the adjustment as between different United States exporters, andat the same time possibly force an excessive burden of adjustment on articular sectors of industry in other countries who have smallerome markets and are less favourably placed to endure drasticadjustments. Nothing is done to increase the total dollar supply tothe non-dollar world, except possibly by forcing the non-dollar world to get their costs down and compete more effectively, or endureunemployment. As for this, no one will deny that a stimulus to more effective competition is healthy; but it would clearly be unwise to applyto Europe at the present time so violent and ill-distributed a stimulusas to cause-unemployment and thus to weaken democratic forces.Board of Trade,September, 1949.
