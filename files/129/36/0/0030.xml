felS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC MJUESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1949SECRET Copy No. 31CP. (49) 18023rd August, 1949CABINETCHINAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs invite my colleagues to consider certain developments which have takenplace in China since this question was last considered by the Cabinet, and to concur in the recommendations made in this paper.2. The United States Ambassador called on me on 21st July and statedthat the United States Secretary of State had expressed a desire to consult with me about China. I told him that I would be prepared to do this when I visitedWashington in September and that meanwhile I was quite willing that conversa-tions should take place at the official level. Certain departmental views on the china situation, which will be found at Annex A, have been communicated tothe American Embassy in London for transmission to the State Department in fulfilment of this undertaking, and on the understanding that they were without commitment to Ministers. I concur in these views and consider they should nowbe endorsed.3. The position is thus that Lam under an obligation to discuss our policy towards China during my forthcoming visit to Washington. It is complicated by the fact that, as will be shown below, United States policy has tended inrecent weeks to diverge from the policy outlined in CP. (48) 299 of 9th Decem-ber, 1948, and approved by the Cabinet on 13th December (CM. (48) 80thConclusions, Minute 3).Present Situation in China4. The Communist advance in China continues. The port of Foochow, inthe province of Fukien opposite Formosa, has fallen and it is suspected thatCanton will be overrun by the Communists in September. There is evidence thatthe authorities of the province of Kwangtung in which Canton is situated aremaking arrangements to come to terms with the Communists. In addition to the southward drive, there is a drive westwards towards Chungking, which may alsobe expected to fall before very long. In the province of Yunnan, which adjoinsBurma and Indo-China, the position is confused, but there is a distinct prospect that this province too will go over to the Communists in the comparatively nearfuture. To all intents and purposes, therefore, the Communists will shortly bein control of the greater part of China and will have extended to the borders ofthe New Territories of Hong Kong.5. The political future is still obscure. In broadcasts and public pronounce-ments the Chinese Communists reiterate the orthodoxy of their Marxist-Leninistideology, their support of the Soviet Union and the Cominform and their opposition to British and American &quot; imperialism.&quot; In the field of practical politics, little has been done to remedy the ills of China to which the Communistshave become heirs, and there is as yet no evidence of a co-ordinated economic policy. It appears probable that a Central Government will be set up in theautumn. A message from a high Communist authority to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, received at third hand after some delay, suggests that there is a conflict37485 B
between those Communists who are fanatical supporters, of the Soviet Union,and, believing in the imminence of a third world war, consider it not worthwhile to seek an arrangement with the Western Powers; and those who, while100 per cent. Communist, consider that the consolidation of their position mustbe a slow process and that it is necessary to enter into relations and to trade withthe West. The extreme faction is said to control the propaganda machine, andthis is said to explain why Communist publicity is wholly hostile to the western powers. That there is a conflict within the Chinese Communist Party is believed to be a fact; for the rest it remains to be seen how a Communist Central Govern-ment, when it is set up, will behave towards the Western Powers.Position of British Trading Interests in Communist China6. The position of our trading communities in Communist China givescause for serious concern. There has been no physical molestation on the partof the Communists, though their attitude has on the whole been unco-operativeand aloof. The threat of crippling taxation is already causing British trading interests to wonder whether they will be able to continue in such circumstances.The Communists continue to have no dealings with our Embassy at Nanking or with our Consulates in Communist China.Nationalist Blockade7. The chief cause for the present serious situation has, however, been theNationalist blockade of Shanghai and Tientsin. The latter may now becomeineffective as a result of the occupation by Communist forces of some of the MiaoIslands at the entrance to the Gulf of Pechili. But the blockade of Shanghai hasbeen effective in preventing the entry or exit of merchant vessels (with theexception of one small ship which managed to run the blockade). The Blue FunnelSteamship Anchises was bombed and machine-gunned by Nationalist aircraft and became a casualty for which compensation is being claimed.8. The result of this blockade now is that British firms in Shanghai are ina parlous condition. The exchange is entirely fictitious and is tied to the priceof rice. Firms are without funds to pay wages, and in order to avoid labourtroubles it is proving necessary, according to the China Association (which represents the London offices of British firms in China), to remit sterling from london to the extent of some  350,000 or more a month. It has been represented to me that this drain cannot continue and that many firms will be forced to closedown before long. Some of them who have stocks can carry on until these areexhausted, but even of these some have decided to close down if the situation doesnot improve.9. This very serious situation could be at any rate alleviated if it were found possible to send ships to Shanghai which could bring in relief supplies (e.g., Inter-national Refugee Organisation stores, household and medical supplies). As onemeans of doing this, an approach was made to the United States Governmentsuggesting that parallel representations be made to the Nationalist Governmentto permit the passage of ships for relief purposes. The United States Govern -ment at first returned a negative reply to this suggestion, but eventually agreedto make a parallel approach on the understanding that their emphasis would beupon the evacuation of their nationals rather than upon relief. Since shipsbringing in supplies could be used for evacuation, we saw no reason to argue thispoint, and representations were accordingly made by the United Kingdom and united States representatives at Canton on 15th August.10. The United States Government have now received a reply to the effectthat the National Government agree in principle to ,a repatriation vessel callingat Shanghai. They would not permit carriage of cargo which might be of direct value to the &quot;Communists, but would allow other inward cargo provided it is &quot; limited to the minimum amount regarded as essential to secure Communistpermission for the ship&apos;s entry.&quot; They will not permit the carriage of anycargo from Shanghai. No reply has yet been made to the United KingdomGovernment.The National Government&apos;s reply to the United States Government doesnot appear to meet the requirements of British merchants in Shanghai, since a single ship will not be sufficient for the purposes of relief. It may, on the otherhand, meet United States requirements for evacuation.   If United States needs
are satisfied, it is. not improbable that:the National Government will decline tolift the blockade any further in order to meet United Kingdom needs.il.: In the meantime the Shanghai situation continues to deteriorate, andthe attitude of the British community there is indicated in Shanghai telegram! No. 69,4 of 18th August (Annex B). I consider that the time has come when wej must make up our minds to follow one of two Courses. The first would be to reverse the policy we have so far &quot;adopted and indicate to the British communitiesj in Communist China that they can count on no support or relief and shouldmake up their own minds whether in the circumstances they will remain. Thesecond would be, if the Nationalists fail to meet our request to give safe-conductto our ships to proceed to Shanghai with relief supplies, to decide to escort shipsthrough the blockade. As a first step we should inform the United StatesGovernment of our intentipn and express the hope that even if they felt unableto subscribe to this pplicy, they  wpuld not publicly oppose it. Haying alreadyrepresented formally to the Nationalist Government our view that the blockadewhich they are conducting is illegal, we should then proceed to carry put our intention to escort ships. Before doing so, it would of course be necessary tosecure an undertaking pf safe-conduct and speedy turn-round from the Com-munist authorities at Shanghai, which should not prove impossible. The viewsof His Majesty&apos;si^nhfissadpr in Cfyina on the blockade will be found at Annex C.Divergence between the United Kingdom, and United States Policies in China12. It is desirable to consider here the extent to which United kingdom policy is tending to diverge from that of the United States. The United StalesGovernment were informed in December last year of the general sense of the view which the Cabinet then took of the situation in China (CP. (48) 299 of9th December, 1948) and were invited to consult with us. Since then, consultationhas taken place between His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Washington and the state department, but beyond indicating their anxiety about the control of the flow of strategic raw materials tp Communist China the United States Government havenever given any cfear indicajtipn of their policy, though on the whole they haveseemed disposed to concur in our view that our nationals should remain in Chinaand that we should jointly follow a policy of keeping &quot;a foot in the door.&apos;&apos;13. Recently, however, without any prior warning, United States policyseems to have taken a sharp turn jn the direction of retreat. While on the onehand the State Department issued a White Paper of some 1,100 pages which sought to justify the past policy of the United States in China and liberallycastigated the Nationalist Government of China, on the other they appear tohave decided that it is no longer desirable that they should keep a foot in the door, and to be desirous of evacuating their nationals from China as soon aspossible (it is fpr this purpose that they want ships to pass through the blockade).The State Department have decided to close their Consulates at Canton, Kunming,Chungking and Tihwa, and drastically to reduce their staffs at Nanking andShanghai. They have asked His Majesty&apos;s Government to take charge, not only of their consular properties, but also of American interests. To this I haveagreed, since, in spite of the embarrassment which it may cause, the resentmentwhich would be aroused in the United States were we to refuse would be likelyto affect our relations adversely at this critical time.14. The fact that the United States have asked our Consuls to take chargeof their interests suggests that they do not intend to quarrel with our intentionto remain in China. It is difficult to understand what the present trend of american policy denotes, but there is understood to be a school of thought whichconsiders that Communist China should be allowed to relapse into complete chaos,which will encourage the Chinese people to overthrow the Communist regime.This is diametrically opposite to our own view as outlined in Annex A to thismemorandum, namely, that if we are not to drive Communist China into the arms of Moscow we must do our utmost to maintain Western contacts.15. It is easier for the United States to cut their losses in China than forthe United Kingdom to do so. Their trading interests are fewer and not sodeep-rooted and their communities are smaller. Moreover, the total loss of theirtrading interests means less tp the United States than a similar loss means to theUnited Kingdom in our present economic and financial condition.37485 b 2
16. We are faced with the dilemma that unless we can persuade the UnitedStates authorities to agree with us we must either agree to differ and pursueour own policy in China of keeping a foot in the door, or abandon the whole ofour interests in China in order to follow in the American wake. The fact thatthe United States have asked us to take charge of their interests in; Chinasuggests that they are not unwilling that we should adopt a different course fromtheir own,&apos; and in the circumstances I recommend that we should adhere to thepolicy of remaining in China as long as we can.The Extent of our Commitments17. It is necessary to examine whether, by adopting a different policy fromthat of the United States, we are entering into commitments which are in excessof our capabilities in our present straitened circumstances. The answer, I think,is that we should, in fact, be entering into no major commitments. The only step which His Majesty&apos;s Government are being asked to take at present is to ensurethat merchant vessels are able to enter the port of Shanghai in order to bringrelief to our merchant communities. If, in the event, there is no relief and british firms decide to close down, we shall be asked to provide facilities for evacuation,and this we should be prepared to do. Apart from the fact that the escorting ofBritish merchant ships might entail a clash with the rapidly disintegratingNationalist Government of China, we are not likely to be called upon to accept any major risks or to incur any vast expenditure. If in the event our policy of keeping a foot in the door proves to be a failure and we have to withdraw from china altogether, we shall be no worse off than if we withdraw now.Position of His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Ambassador in China18. I pass now to the position of our Ambassador in China. The UnitedStates Government, who at one time advocated that like-minded Powers shouldtake concerted action, withdrew their Ambassador from Nanking for consultation* without waiting for other Powers. The French Ambassador, who is ill in shanghai, has received instructions to return as soon as he is fit to travel. TheNetherlands Ambassador, who has reached retiring age, has been recalled. TheIndian Ambassador at Nanking has recommended that he should be recalled to new Delhi for consultation before the formation of a coalition Government. the lack of shipping and air transport renders it unlikely that any heads of foreignmissions at Nanking will be able to leave for the time being.19. Sir Ralph Stevenson remains at Nanking. But when it appears likely that a Communist Central Government is about to be set up, I consider it wiilbe desirable to withdraw him for consultation. For if he then remains at nanking the Communist Government may demand either immediate recognitionor his immediate withdrawal, which might place us in an embarrassing positionand force us to make a decision before we are ready to do so. As indicated in annex A, the question of recognition of a Communist Government is closely connected with the question of Chinese representation in the United nations organisation, and it will clearly be necessary to consult Avith other commonwealth governments and with the United States and France before deciding upon an act of recognition.20. In the above circumstances I propose to authorise Sir Ralph Stevensonto withdraw when it appears likely that a Communist Central Government isabout to be set up. On present information this may be in September or Octoberof this year. We should notify other Commonwealth Governments and the UnitedStates of our intention.Control of Strategic Materials21. At their meeting on 22nd July (S.A.C. (49) 6th Meeting, Minute 1) the china and South-East Asia Committee decided the terms of the reply to bemade to the United States Governments representations on the subject of thecontrol of the flow of strategic materials to China. This reply did not satisfy the United States Government, and a memorandum on the subject, which willbe found at Annex D, was handed to the Minister of State on 3rd August.22. Though it is not clear that the United States have any grounds fortheir apparent anxiety on this question, it is clear that they attach great
importance to it, and I have been warned that the matter will be raised duringI my forthcoming visit to Washington.   I recommend that I should be authorisedto reply in the terms of the draft which will be found at Annex E.Summary of recommendations i recommend that:-       i(1) If a satisfactory reply is received from the Nationalist Government about,the passage of relief ships, immediate steps should be taken to arrange.for their passage to Shanghai with the necessary relief stores.(2) If, as appears probable, the Nationalists only agree to the passage of- single vessels for repatriation purposes, the decision be taken inprinciple to escort British merchant vessels past th&apos;e blockade to shangai; and that the United States Government be informed ofthis decision, which should not be put into effect until their reactionis known.(3) I be authorised to discuss our policy towards China with Mr. Achesonon the basis of this paper and in particular of Annex A; that Ishould seek to persuade him that this policy is the right one; but thatif the United States do not feel able to follow it themselves, they shouldnot criticise us for so doing.(4) His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Nanking be instructed to withdraw for consultation when it becomes apparent that a Central communist government of China is about to be set up; and that the other-members of the Commonwealth, the United States, France and other friendly Powers be informed of our intention.(5) I be authorised to reply to the State Department on the lines of Annex Eon the control of the flow of strategic materials to China.(6) Other Commonwealth Governments also be informed of our intentions asregards recommendations (1), (2), (3) and (5).E. B.2Srd August, 1949.ANNEX AChina : Report by OfficialsGeneralThere do not seem to be any further grounds for hope that the Communistswill fail in their bid for complete power in China. Effective or prolonged resistance-tance cannot be expected from the discredited Nationalist Government, whichcan no longer hope for large-scale outside assistance, nor, a fortiori, from anysplinter factions into which the Nationalist Government may disintegrate.Planning must therefore be on the assumption of Communist domination of thewhole of China in the near future.2. There is no doubt that the present leaders of the Chinese CommunistParty are orthodox Marxists-Leninists and that their present strongly pro-soviet policy constitutes a serious threat to Western political and economic interestsnot only in China but also in South-East Asia.3. As regards South-East Asia, it would appear of cardinal importance;to encourage the establishment of an effective anti-Communist front to preventpommunist encroachment beyond the borders of China. As regards China itself,jit is considered that at the present stage any outside attempt to prevent the Com-punists from attaining complete power would not only be bound to fail but would rally the traditionally xenophobe Chinese behind their new rulers, and[that to display a general and avowed hostility to the new regime is calculated to drive it further into the arms of Moscow.4. It is therefore considered that the only hope of encouraging the emergencen China of a less anti-Western tendency is to give the new regime time to realise)oth the necessity of Western help in overcoming its economic difficulties, andthe natural incompatibility of Soviet imperialism with Chinese national interests\e.g., in Manchuria).r
Every opening for emphasising that Moscow&apos;? designs are incompatible witha strong and independent China should be seized. In general, we wish to avoidas far as possible head-on conflict with the Communists at present,&apos; though wehave no intention of pursuing a policy of appeasement on major issues.Economic5. For the following reasons it is considered that Western commercial and financial interests should endeavour to maintain themselves in China for as long as possible : (a) If and when the Communists begin to realise the necessity for tradewith, the West in&apos;overcoming their economic difficulties, it is to be presumed that their first advances will be made hot to Governmentsbut to private concerns, and it is therefore/important that there shouldbe Western concerns in China which can be approached. If at alater stage the Communists wish to make an approach to Governments,it is cpnsiderejd that their proposals should be considered on their merits. His Majesty&apos;s Government have, pf course, ho intention ofmaking official advances to the Communists, but&apos; they equally do not wish to show open hostility by dissuading British commercial interestsfrom entering into normal commercial relations with them.(6) Although there can be no doubt about the fundamental hostility of chinese communism to foreign mercantile committees, it neverthelessremains possible that experience may induce a more realistic attitude in ttie Communist authorities, who are at present themselves to someextent prisoners of their own propaganda&apos;. There may fee few grounds for optimism as to the future; but we should be unwise to abandonwhat remains of pur position in China until it becomes abundantly clear that it is untenable. It is of course practically certain that long-established and (^eep-rppted commercial&apos; establishments &quot;and conhec-tions, once abandoned, could never be restored.(c) In view of its position in Hong Kong and South-East Asia, the UnitedKingdom has, of course, every reason for being anxious to avoidmercantile transactions of a kind which mighl result in increasingthe military strength of Communist China. It is not considered,however, that the continuance of normal trade in civilian require-ments need result in any perceptible accretion to the war potential ofa Communist administration in China, while any hardships resultingfrom the cessation pf trade would fall, in the major industrial townsat any rate, on the population as a whole. These would, of qourise,be represented by the Chinese Communists as entirely ,due tp the hostility of the &quot;Imperialist&quot; Powers.&apos;(d) It is recognise^ that foreign economic&apos; interests in China are likelysooner or later to be f aped Mt)i tjh/e threat pf expropriation. &apos; ProYidedthat the norma^ channels of coinmeWp are still Open the Communistdesire  or trade witn the West may conceivably be strong pnbugh forsome sort of trade and compensation&apos;&apos; agTeement &quot;to&apos;, ije $ curedeventually.(e) But perhaps more important than the foregoing considerations is thefact that foreign trading communities constitute a major element in western influence in China. We consider that it is of the first importance to maintain for as long as possible the maximum Westerncontact and influence behind the Asiatic Iron Curtain, particularlybearing in mind that it may conceivably prove (that b^e of jthe tasks- most beyond the powers of the Communist regime may be that ofregimenting and controlling the deep-rooted trading propensities ofthe individual Chinese. So long as hope remains of exploiting theChinese instinct to trade to the detriment of the jCoihmunist causecomplete abandonment of our position in China would appear fp be premature, to say the least.(/) Finally, in the long term, the potentialities of China under a strong and efficient Government as a source of raw material and foodstuffs and as an export market should not be forgotten; It would be amisfortune should at some future time these potentialities be realisedif the Western world were then cut off from what might become avail-able.  It must still be our hope that opportunities will eventually arise
for co-operation by the Western world with an effective ChineseGovernment for the economic development of the country for thebenefit of the Far East and the world as a whole: The severance ofexisting commercial links with China would run entirely counter to such an objective, however remote it may seem for the present.6. For the above reasons, although our merchants in China may eventuallyhave to cut their losses and leave, it is considered&apos; that it is neither in bur politicalnor in our economic interests that they should dd this if it can b^.avoided; andwe do not share the view, which we gather to be that of the U nited states authorities, that foreign merchants who have stayed behind have put themselvesin the position of hostages in their search for private gain arid are thereforedeserving of little sympathy. Moreover, it must be remembered that the british firms in China are private traders, The decision whether it is worth while forthem to continue to try to keep alive their activities must still primarily be theirs.His Majesty&apos;s Government would not in existing circumstances feel justified in seeking to prevent those who are willing and able to go on trading and wouldcertainly not wish to be responsible by such prevention for any ensuing losses.7. This does not, of course, mean that British mercantile communities inChina would be advised to continue indefinitely to do business on humiliatingand unequal terms. It is intended that British concerns in China should be encouraged to cb-ojierate fully with each other, and with the commercial com-munities of other friendly Powers, so that as trade opportunities offer they willbe in a position to take advantage of Communist needs to secure improvements in the conditions under which they are permitted to operate.Evacuation8. As indicated above, His Majesty&apos;s Government are not in favour of a premature abandonment of British interests in China, and they consider that the longer British merchants and British missionaries (the two main elements of theBritish communities in China) are able to maintain a footing in China the morehope there is of maintaining British political and economic interests.9. Broadly speaking the British communities in China are still determined to maintain themselves if they can, though of recent weeks there has been somefeeling in favour of evacuation. If British nationals want to leave His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will certainly furnish such assistance as they can to enable them todo so, but it is not proposed, at present at least, to advise them to do so wholesale.Recognition10. The Charter of the United Nations (Articles 23 and 27 (3)) appearsto be so framed that unless there is a Chinese representative the Security Councilcan take decisions only on procedural matters. It therefore seems essential thatde jure recognition should not be withdrawn from one Chinese government until de jure recognition can be accorded to its successor.. The question of continuing to recognise the Nationalist Government and of according recognition to the Communists thus appear to be two facets of the same problem.11. No question of according de jure or de facto recognition to the Coih-munists can arise until the Communists form a Government claiming to be ofnational character. However, there are various indications that the Communistshope,by their present offensive southwards to acquire so much territory as to be clearly the effective rulers of China. They will then probably set up a Government,to which Soviet recognition will doubtless promptly be accorded. The Communistsapparently hope that this stage will be reached, by mid-autumn 1949.12. It is thus likely that the recognition question will become acute in thenext few months. There are, however, still too many undetermined factors for detailed consideration of the action to be taken in all possible contingencies tobe profitable at this stage. The issues therefore can be usefully discussed only ingeneral terms.13. At the worst, the relations, of the British Commonwealth and north atlantic Powers with a Communist Chinese Government after recognition mayfollow the pattern of their relations With Soviet satellite States in Eastern Europe.There is, however, the possibility that the pattern will eventually develop along
the lines of our present relationship with Yugoslavia, and it is therefore considered that the Western Powers should be careful not to prejudice futurepossibilities by developing an openly hostile attitude towards a Communist regimefrom the outset.14. The political objections to precipitate recognition of a Communist regimeare obvious. On the other hand, to withhold recognition from a Government ineffective control of a large part of China is legally objectionable and leads tograve practical difficulties regarding the protection of Western interests in China.It is most unlikely that the fulfilment of any special conditions can be exacted inreturn for recognition of the Communist regime, and it is therefore probable thatafter a certain stage delay in proceeding with recognition might seriously prejudice Western interests in China without any compensating advantages being obtained. The Chinese Communists themselves are unlikely to be seriously incon-venienced by the withholding of recognition. For their part they will probablydecline to enter into diplomatic relations with any Power which continues torecognise the Nationalist Government.15. Since the Nationalist Government is not considered to be any longercapable of maintaining effective resistance, the question of its continuedrecognition by the Powers should be considered on a basis of practical conveniencerather than of sentiment. If there is Nationalist control in Formosa and /or in western China, it may be considered sufficient to regard the authority there asthe de facto authority in control. The most important factor governing continuedrecognition of the Nationalist Government will, however, be the question ofUnited Nations representation.16. As regards Chinese representation in the United Nations Organisation,it seems probable that, according to the Communist timetable as far as it can beestimated, the National Government will continue to represent China during theforthcoming session of the Assembly. But the possibility cannot be excluded thata change of China&apos;s representation will become a live and controversial issue evenwhile the Assembly is in session. It is impossible to determine in advance whatthe attitude of the Commonwealth and North Atlantic Powers should be in suchan event, but clearly it will be desirable that there should be close and continuingconsultation between them.Foreign Office, 15th August, 1949.ANNEX BTelegram from Shanghai to Foreign Office(Secret)(No. 694) 18th August, 1949.The British Emergency Planners&apos; Policy Committee has taken note ofmessage conveyed in your telegram No. 472 to me. They made two comments:that it makes no reference to ships which are essential both for those who remainand for those who must leave, and that there is no mention of wider considerations of British policy in the Far East.2. I have accordingly given the committee as much information as isnecessary to enable them to realise what is being done to get ships here, and Ihave assured them that His Majesty&apos;s Government has so far approved the policyof keeping a foot in the door here in China. They remain, however, deeplyconcerned not only about the future of the British community in Shanghai, butalso about the whole of this country with which they are associated in the far east. They are particularly worried about the effect of the two external factorsover which they have no control, namely, American policy, particularly its supportof the blockade, and recent trends in Hong Kong.3. As regards American policy, while British business men agree that newChinese authorities are Communist in ideology, they are not prepared to agreewith the Americans that refugee Communists are the tools of Moscow, that nocompromise is possible with them and that there is no future for foreign business.On the contrary, they still believe the Chinese will maintain their independence and that given time they will realise their need of help from Democrats and turnincreasingly towards them.
4. So far as the blockade is concerned British business men deplore asentirely fallacious the American view that the blockade can have an early anddecisive effect on the political situation. Chinese: economy was, already iiidesperate straits without the blockade, They see no reason to doubt that theCommunist, military machine will remain in military control for years.8. , As regards Hong Kong the committee fears, the point made byMr. Alexander has been forgotten, namely, that the future of the colonies is linked:by friendly relations with the Government of China. Seen from here the emphasisseems to be increasingly on the military aspect and the impression derived is thatHis Majesty^ Government is resigned to a clash over Hong Kong. In thesecircumstances the committee wish me to say (a.) The British business community is by and large willing to remain here and to continue its efforts to reach a, modus vivendi with the new regime, but they heed.a definite reassurance that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-,ment Still desire and consider it safe for them to do so.(b) The establishment of communications with Hong Kong is vitally urgent and that in the committee&apos;s view the Nationalists will not agree to any arrangement which would be a real help to the British. They ask whether His Majesty&apos;s Government is prepared to re-establishcommunications without Kuomlntang approval. &apos;(c) They hope it may be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to develop and promulgate a policy which will maintain the British position herewithout offence to the Americans, committed as they are &quot;to evacuation.6. The Committee ask me to emphasise that a number of managers of tradingand industrial concerns in Shanghai have discretion to close down, if necessary,giving first consideration to the safety of their staffs, who, of course, constitute alarge part of the community. They want to hang on ,put have now reached a point where they must decide not to do so unless they can be assured of support fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government.ANNEX CTelegram from Nanking to Foreign Office(No. 1234)(Confidential) - 13th August, 1949.Shanghai situation.My three Commonwealth colleagues have just returned from Shanghai wherethey had Opportunities for examination of the situation and for full discussions with representatives of all Commonwealth interests.2. Their general conclusion, with which I am in agreement, is that withnoSalleviation of the &quot;blockade &quot; and an intensification of the difficulties dueto the artificial exchange rate, foreign commercial and industrial interests aredangerously near the end of tfheir tether. In our opinion the position has nowdeteriorated from that described in my telegrams under reference to a point where some remedial action is urgently necessary.3. Much disappointment is apparent at the lack of progress in arranging for measures to alleviate the blockade (e.g., relief ships and &quot;Air Venture Com-pany &quot;) and there is a tendency to become discouraged despite the fact that thefears of continued victimisation of foreigners (paragraph 2 (d) of my telegramNo. 1031) have not been fulfilled. Community interests sttch as the hospitals,the schools, the churches, the clubs, &amp;c, as well as important businesses, are facingcumulative troubles which if not soon alleviated, wili lead to their drasticcurtailment or extinction. It is no longer a question of individual losses (seeShanghai telegram No. 666). &quot;4. I am of the opinion that having rightly taken the decision to &apos;&apos; keep a foot in the door &quot; in China we should have the courage of our convictions andshould now do all we can to help our people to hold on. On the one hand weshould not be too fearful of Our honest difference of opinion with the UnitedStates Government and on the other hand We should not let too meticulous regard37485 c
for the feelings of moribund Nationalism (which it should be, remembered hasshown itself consistently unfriendly to us in the past) prevent us from protectingour own interests.5. There is apparently no useful action which can at present be taken inregard to artificial&apos;exchange rates. But something can and should *be done to alleviate the blockade which is merely injuring foreign interests and not to any appreciable extent the interests of the Communists. It can have no conceivableeffect on the outcome or even on the progress of the war.6. In this connexion the attitude of the United States Government regardingboth the scheme for relief ships and the proposal for an &quot; Air Venture Company &quot;is the first obstacle to be surmounted. I suggest that representatives in Washing-ton of the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and India should make a combinedapproach to the United States Government (supplementing the message containedin your telegram No. 7581 to Washington) pointing out that the fundamental difference between the nature of the Commonwealth interests in China and thatof American interests makes it inevitable that we should pursue different methods to attain our common goal of keeping China open to democratic influences and urging the United States Government to support as strongly as possible our request to the Nationalist Government to agree to the despatch of relief ships(see my telegram No.. 1187, paragraph 4). Our representatives in washington should ,at the same time, try to prevail upon the United States Government towithdraw their objections to the proposed &quot;Air Venture Company.&quot;7. Apart from the question of Shanghai I consider that there is much to besaid from a political point of view for an increase in contacts by sea and airbetween Hong Kong and the Communist occupied territory before the fall ofCanton and the arrival of Communist troops on the frontier of new territories.8. Should support of the United States Government not&apos; be forthcomingwithin a reasonable time I consider that the Commonwealth Governments should themselves approach Nationalist Government making it clear that the latter&apos;sclosure of Chinese ports, which we do not recognise as valid, is destroying our interests (without incidentally advancing their cause) and that we are thereforecompelled to relieve the discomfitures of our communities so far as we can by sending supplies to them by sea and removing those of our nationals who wishto go.9. I would be in favour of our presuming (not asking for) the concurrence of the Nationalist Government and of making immediate arrangements for thedespatch of periodical relief ships to Shanghai and, if that should later prove necessary, to Tientsin. The worst that could happen to a relief ship (apart frompossible Air Venture bombardment) would be to be turned back by Nationalistnaval patrol in the Yangtse estuary and I think there is a fair chance of itsgetting through without serious challenge.10.

Although it is recognised that the final form of the United Kingdomsreply to the United States proposals regarding the control of trade with china is .still subject to confirmation of other interested British Departments, theDepartment of State has read with disappointment the tentative British response,which the Foreign Office recently communicated to the Embassy.2. During the meetings held in the Foreign Office beginning 21st July, 1949,the United States representatives stressed on several occasions their belief that itwas highly important that the Western Powers demonstrate their bargainingstrength vis-a-vis the Chinese Communist regime for protection, if necessary, of
western interests in China, and that those Powers be in a position possibly to influence the orientation of that regime through the concerted control of selectedexports of key importance to the Chinese-economy. The Department of State,consequently, is seriously concerned that the proposed United Kingdom responserepresents far less than the absolute minimum requirements for joint protectivemeasures in view of the present Chinese situation.3. Any failure to demonstrate effective western control over selected keyimports would represent the abandonment of the most important single instrumentavailable for the defence of mutual vital western interests in China and the far east generally. Yet the proposed United Kingdom response would appear to implythe desirability of a completely passive role by the Western nations in their economic relations with China. Such a role would extend not only to all strategicaspects of the China-problem, but would cast serious doubt on the possibility of arriving at an effective joint approach towards the mutually agreed objective ofcombating the spread of communism throughout Asia.4. In regard to the specific implementation of a positive approach, theDepartment of State has the following comments : 5. The Department understands that the United Kingdom is prepared tokeep the flow of 1A strategic goods and materials to Communist China andNorthern Korea under control, since it is, of course, necessary to prevent possibletranshipments via China to the Soviet orbit. It also appreciates the importance which the United Kingdom attaches to securing, before the United Kingdom canextend its export controls over 1A items to cover transhipment in Hong kong and Singapore, prior assurance from the Belgian, French and Dutch governments that these Governments are prepared to take similar action covering both theirmetropolitan and Far East colonial territories. The Department is pleased, inthis connection, to assure the United Kingdom Government that S.C.A.P. is nowcontrolling strategic exports to China in accordance with the proposed UnitedStates-United Kingdom policy and that, furthermore, the United States Govern-ment is prepared to obtain Philippine co-operation.6.&apos; The Department agrees that joint control of petroleum shipments isimportant, but regards it as only one aspect of a common general control pattern.7. Although the Department of State and the Foreign Office thus appear tobe largely in accord regarding the above two types of controls, and although theDepartment hopes that the United Kingdom Government may be able to extendcontrol over the transhipment of 1A items through its Far Eastern colonies,1A and petroleum export controls alone would not be adequate to permit theWestern Powers to demonstrate their bargaining strength vis-a-vis the chinese communist regime, to influence the orientation of that regime, and therefore to combat the spread of communism throughout Asia. The reasons for this are that(a) China depends relatively little upon imports of 1A items, and (6) petroleumcontrols not only would be effected largely through informal arrangements with private companies rather than through governmental export licensing, but inaddition Chma&apos;s petroleum purchases over the foreseeable future are likely to be far below normal civilian requirements.8. The Department therefore believes that it is principally through theinclusion of selected IB items in the present pattern of the United Kingdom&apos;s1A licensing system that the Western Powers can secure leverage in dealing withthe Chinese Communists. More exchange of information would not be sufficient for this purpose.9. The selective character of the IB items which might be included under1A controls was evident in the discussions between United Kingdom and UnitedStates representatives acting as a subcommittee of the United Kingdom-UnitedStates group. It will be recalled that this subcommittee selected five categories of goods in the IB category which might be suitable for control in respect ofChina: All essential types of mining equipment.Essential power generating equipment.Really essential transport equipment.Steel mill equipment.PetroleUm products. &apos;37485 i)
for the feelings of moribund Nationalism (which it should be remembered hasshown itself consistently unfriendly to us in the past) prevent us from protectingour own interests.5. There is apparently no useful action which can at present be taken inregard to artificial&apos;exchange rates. But something can and should be done to alleviate the blockade which is merely injuring foreign interests and not to any appreciable extent the interests of the Communists. It can have no conceivableeffect on the outcome or even on the progress of the war.8. In this connexion the attitude of the United States Government regardingboth the scheme for relief ships and the proposal for an &quot; Air Venture Company &quot;&apos;is the first obstacle to be surmounted. I suggest that representatives in Washing-ton of the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and India should make a combinedapproach to the United States Government (supplementing the message containedin your telegram No. 7581 to Washington) pointing out that the fundamental difference between the nature of the Commonwealth interests in China and thatof American interests makes it inevitable that we should pursue different methods to attain our common goal of keeping China open to democratic influences and urging the United States Government to support as strongly as possible our request to the Nationalist Government to agree to the despatch of relief ships(see my telegram No. 1187, paragraph 4). Our representatives in washington should ,at the same time, try to prevail upon the United States Government towithdraw their objections to the proposed &quot;Air Venture Company.&quot;7.   Apart from the question of Shanghai I consider that there is much to be -said from a political point of view for an increase in contacts by sea and airbetween Hong Kong and the Communist occupied territory before the fall ofCanton and the arrival of Communist troops on the frontier of new territories.8. Should support of the United States Government not&apos;be forthcomingwithin a reasonable time I consider that the Commonwealth Governments should themselves approach Nationalist Government making it clear that the latter&apos;sclosure of Chinese ports, which we do not recognise as valid, is destroying our interests (without incidentally advancing their cause) and that we are thereforecompelled to relieve the discomfitures of our communities so far as we can by sending supplies to them by sea and removing those of our nationals who wishto go.9.

The Department agrees that joint control of petroleum shipments isimportant, but regards it as only one aspect of a common general control pattern.7. Although the Department of State and the Foreign Office thus appear tobe largely in accord regarding the above two types of controls, and although theDepartment hopes that the United Kingdom Government may be able to extendcontrol over the transhipment of 1A items through its Far Eastern colonies,1A and petroleum export controls alone would not be adequate to permit theWestern Powers to demonstrate their bargaining strength vis-a-vis the chinese communist regime, to influence the orientation of that regime, and therefore to combat the spread of communism throughout Asia.

The Department therefore believes that it is principally through theinclusion of selected IB items in the present pattern of the United Kingdom&apos;s1A licensing system that the Western Powers can secure leverage in dealing withthe Chinese Communists. More exchange of information would not be sufficient for this purpose.9. The selective character of the IB items which might be included under1A controls was evident in the discussions between United Kingdom and UnitedStates representatives acting as a subcommittee of the United Kingdom-UnitedStates group. It will be recalled that this subcommittee selected five categories of goods in the IB category which might be suitable for control in respect ofChina : All essential types of mining equipment.Essential power generating equipment.Really essential transport equipment.Steel mill equipment.Petroleum products.37485 u
In addition there were a number of miscellaneous items in these categories whichwere regarded as of key importance to the Chinese economy.10. The Department wishes therefore to reopen with the Foreign Office thematter of controlling these items, and suggests that the following factors be takeninto account: The Foreign Office has already indicated its desire to control the exportof petroleum products. The same reasoning would appear to require controlof the other categories studied by the subcommittee.The difficulties of including IB items in the present pattern of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s 1A licensing system are recognised. It is not understood, however,why the control of selected IB exports to China could not be effected throughthe creation of a new list under which licences would be required in effectonly for exports to China and adjacent areas. This would limit proceduraldeterrents on Britain&apos;s general export trade to a marginal scope.The question of discrimination seems hardly relevant. Not only does the present pattern of United Kingdom export licensing involve open dis-crimination as between broad areas of the world, but, as maintained success-fully in G.A.T.T. and E.C.E. conferences, the present world situationobviously justifies discrimination on security.In connection with Asia restricting the spread of communism is clearly a security matter for the Western Powers. Control over the export of selected IB items vis-a-vis Communist China is as important for the mutualsecurity interests of the western world as is the control of 1A items to eastern Europe. Certainly as far as Asia is concerned the mutual securityinterests of the western world must be considered at least as much in termsof political and economic strategy as in terms of direct military factors.11. In conclusion, it is difficult for the Department of State to understand what &quot; political and administrative difficulties &quot; might be so great as to outweigh the importance of solidarity in the adoption of a strategy for the maximumprotection of United States-United Kingdom mutual, vital long-range interests.American Embassy,___London, 3rd A ugust, 1949.ANNEX EControl of Trade with ChinaDraft Reply to Avierican Embassy Aide-memoire of 3rd AugustUpon receipt of the American Embassy&apos;s Aide-memoire of 3rd August, theUnited States proposals regarding the control of trade with China were once- again made the subject of careful study by the interested Departments of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.2.   The objectives of the United States proposals appear to be (a) to ensure that Western trade with China does not have as a directconsequence an increase in the military strength of the chinese communist administration; and(b) in the words of the American Embassy&apos;s Aide-memoire, &quot;to influence the orientation of that (the Chinese Communist) regime, and therefore to combat the spread of Communism throughout Asia.&quot; Itappears to be the United States view that this end might be achieved by demonstrating to the Chinese Communists the economic bargainingstrength of the West through the concerted control of selected exportsof key importance to the Chinese economy.3. It is perhaps unnecessary to emphasise that there is no difference between his Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government as to theimportance of these aims. Indeed, His Majesty&apos;s Government, because of their position in Hong Kong and South-East Asia, have immediate and compellingreasons for being anxious to secure the achievement of both objectives.
4. His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that, as far as the first of these twoobjectives is concerned, they have already taken steps which safeguard theposition. They have, for example, not only effectively prohibited the export fromthe United Kingdom of weapons of war of any kind destined for the ChineseNational Government, but have refused to permit the transshipment in hong Kong of military equipment so destined irrespective of its country of origin. They have done this because experience has shown that such shipmentsusually eventually result in an accretion to the military strength of the chinese communists. In any case, the fact that the American Embassy&apos;s Aide-memoireunder reference lays almost exclusive stress on the importance of controls, not from the narrower and more direct security point of view, but in the light ofbroader political considerations, suggests that it is to this latter aspect of thequestion that the United States Government now wish to draw especial attention.5. It has already been stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government fully share the United States Governments anxiety to take such steps as may be effective and practicable to influence the Communist regime in China in the direction ofmore moderate and co-operative courses. Indeed, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentnoted with gratification that the United States Aide-memoire implies the praticability of the exertion of Western influence on the Chinese Communists,since it is because they share this view that His Majesty&apos;s Government do not favour a general policy of evacuation but on the contrary believe it important that the maximum Western influence should continue to be exerted in China.The basic difference between the two Governments on this issue appears to bethat His Majesty&apos;s Government see no grounds for believing that the imposition-tion of export controls of the kind proposed is likely to produce this desirableresult.6. It is understood that the United States proposals do not contemplate any immediate interference in the export to China of the list IB items whichhave been suggested for control, and that the powers which it would be necessaryto assume would, in fact, be held in reserve; the argument being that the mereassumption of these powers would provide an effective demonstration of Westernbargaining strength and might also have the desirable political consequencesmentioned above.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government find it difficult to see the force of this argument. The Chinese Communists are presumably aware that a sovereign state has the power to control its own exports. The assumption of controls forthis purpose would be regarded as a threat to impose economic sanctions andit is hard to see why such a step should be any more effective than an announce-ment designed to remind the Chinese Communists of the economic bargaining position of the West.8. In any case, experience has shown that Communist Governments regardcommercial relations as being entirely dissociated from political relations : theyhave consistently shown themselves to be unwilling to modify their politicalprinciples for the sake of commercial advantages, but they have at the sametime demonstrated their willingness to trade freely, in so far as it is advantageous to them, with capitalist countries with whom they are in acute politicaldivergence.9. The American Embassy&apos;s Aide-memoire refers to the subject ofpetroleum products in the following terms : &apos;&apos; The Foreign Office has already indicated its desire to control theexport of petroleum products. The same reasoning would appear to requirecontrol of the other categories studied by the sub-committee.&quot;There is, however, an important difference between the United Kingdom objective in regard to petroleum products and the United States objective in regard tothe other categories proposed for control. The United States proposal is thatthis latter group of items should be controlled, not because of its immediatesecurity importance but because of the general political bargaining strength which it is asserted that such controls would bestow. As has already been stated,His Majesty&apos;s Government are sceptical of the efficacy of export controls aimed at a modification of the political alignment of the Chinese Communist regime,and are not disposed to institute controls for such a purpose.   In the case of
petroleum products, however, there is an obvious security interest. It is clearlyof direct security importance to prevent the Chinese Communists from acquiringsubstantial reserves of petroleum products. Although the military operations of the Chinese Communists within China have not involved any substantialconsumption of petroleum products, plans must be made on the assumption thatsooner or later they will endeavour to expand beyond the frontiers of China.For such a purpose substantial quantities of petroleum products might wellbe indispensable. His Majesty&apos;s Government have to give particular considera-tion to the case of Hong Kong. It is considered that any overt attack on HongKong from the Chinese mainland could be successfully resisted unless the aggressor were able to acquire, at any rate temporarily, command of the air and sea. It was because of considerations of this order that the communicationrecently made by the Foreign Office to the American Embassy laid particularstress on the importance of petroleum products.10. His Majesty&apos;s Government have indicated to the United States Govern-ment in another context that they see important advantages in the continuedmaintenance in China for as long as possible of Western commercial and financial interests. It is precisely because they are anxious to secure the second of the twoobjectives referred to in paragraph 2 above that they do not wish to show openhostility to the Chinese Communists by dissuading British commercial interestsfrom entering into normal commercial relations with them. This does not mean that their policy in this regard can be considered as purely passive as is suggestedin the United States Aide-memoire. On the contrary, they consider it to be ofimportance to maintain their general position in China for as long as possiblein order to permit the carrying out of a flexible policy of exerting influence andpressure whenever opportunity offers. They do not, however, consider that themeans proposed by the United States Government are likely to lead to the desiredresult.
