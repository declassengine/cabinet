Inparticular I should Y/ish myself to make a much&apos; morethorough investigation of the prospective timberposition before any conclusions can be drawn about its effect on various parts of the capital investment programme.In my view, however - and this is the onlyimmediate relevance of the report - the broadconclusion can be drawn that there is no easy wayof reducing inflationary pressure by cuts in invest-ment without major changes in Government policy.H.W.1Board of Trade, S.W%1*,24th August, 1949*
INTERIM REPORT BY THE IimSTMMT PROGRAMMES COMMITTEEPART I;   General considerations1* 1 The object of this note is to examine very broadly the possibilities of curtailing investment in order to relieveinflationary pressures.2. In 19^8 gross fixed investment reached the high level of  2,000 millions.   It absorbed no less than one-fifth ofthe total national resources available for use at home. Forthe current year the approved programme, at the same prices,is  2,100 millions, though the actual out-turn may prove to be somewhat lower.   For 1950 a still higher programme of  2,130millions has been provisionally endorsed by the production committee.3. Programmes of this size clearly make a heavy draft onour total resources and inevitably compete powerfully in one way or another with our export effort.   Moreover, with consumptiondemand and Government expenditure both running strongly, theselarge programmes present a constant threat to the stability ofprices, unless enough purchasing pov/er is held back throughsavings by the public and the Government to pay for them. to reverse or at least halt the growth of investment would, bylimiting competition for available resources, help to reduce the pressure on prices and also permit resources to bo used morefreely for other purposes - notably for export.k*   ,        The present position differs from that of two yearsago when an attempt v/as made to cut investment.   Then the principalaim was to reduce the amount of investment in progress and pro-jected within the limits of the resources then employed on it.By now we have succeeded in bringing about a rough, overallbalance between work in hand and the resources currently employedon it.   The numbers engaged in the building and civil engineering-industries have been stabilised and indeed a re to-day the sameas they were a year ago.   It may well be that a moderate scalingdown of the volume of new work allowed to start would stimulategreater mobility within the industry and in the end. give a fillipto productivity.   But it cannot be said that for this limitedpurpose any drastic adjustment of the amount of work in progress is required.5. There is, hov/ever, a new factor.   The cut in importsfrom the dollar area will reduce the total volume of resources available for use at home and will have a two-fold effect onthe investment programme.   First, some supplies needed for investment will be reduced - notably softwood.   Secondly, the cut in imported raw materials generally will impose a check on thegrowth of industrial activity and, therefore, of the national product available for investment and consumption.   We shall thus be in a weaker position to support the present growth of ourinvestment programme, and it will be more difficult to keep the investment attempted within the limits of private savings andthe budget surplus.6. ^ In the following analysis it is assumed thatisinflationary measures would be taken simultaneously in otherields.   Such measures would affect the level of investment inarious ways.   A cut in Government expenditure, for example,ight automatically eliminate some investment that is wholly^r partly financed from Exchequer funds *   In the face of generaldeflationary measures industrialists might elect to postponeome of their investment projects.   Likewise private&quot;individuals
might feel obliged to limit their outlays in the miscellaneouscategory of investment, e*gi the repair and maintenance of houses and expenditure on durable consumer goods.   It is impossible to predict what reductions of this sort might amount to, but it isimportant to remember that specific cuts in investment deliberatelyenforced by administrative action may well be supplemented byspontaneous cuts induced by a deflationary policy.7. Secondly, it is assumed that adjustments of investment programmes should not require either the stoppage of worksalready in progress or the cancellation of existing contracts.This would only cause confusion and waste disproportionate tothe savings likely to be achieved.8. Thirdly, if cuts are to be made with certaintythey must be made where they can be enforced.   This turns on themeasure of control, exerciseable by central Government. Itshould be easier to secure compliance with a change-of investmentpolicy in the public than in the private sector.  About 55 percent of the construction work lies in the public sector, but only25 per cent of the plant and machinery.   Moreover, building work,which is subject to licence and authorisation, is moresusceptible of adjustment than investment in plant and machinery,which is not directly controlled.   Some 60 per cent of total investment is in construction and 40 per cent in plant and machinery^9% Fourthly, those parts of the investment programme which are likely to make a significant contribution to our economic recovery and to the reduction of costs should beaffected as little as possible.10. But a warning is necessary.   Fixed investment is the product of two quite distinct groups of industries - theengineering industries on the one hand and the building and civil engineering industries on the other.   The engineering-industries have a very large stake in the export market whichthey must preserve if they are to remain prosperous.   If the homeinvestment demand for their products is curtailed, the labourand other resources released can in many cases be switched overin a very direct fashion to serve the industries&apos; export market,given that the operation is carried out in an orderly way and an effective overseas demand for their products continues. Butthe building and. civil engineering industries are almost whollydependent on the home market and much of the building materialsindustries is in a similar position.   Resources released by a restriction of building work would, therefore, have to move outof the industry in which they are now employed or the rate oftheir replacement would have to be scaled down.   The releaseof resources would,therefore, be indirect, slow to mature andmore doubtfully effective, though incomes in the building industry would be cut, thus reducing the pressure of consumers1 demandgenerallyB  For the same reason the advantages would not be soobvious nor so readily demonstrable to those in the industriesaffected, and it would be necessary to face the fact that therewould be something more than merely transitional unemployment.Clearly more harm than good would be done by bringing about sucha situation unless the Government were firmly resolved to limit the scale of building activity and were able to keep it limitedfor some time ahead.   If in the event relaxations were introduced to minimise the resulting unemployment, the onlyeffect would be to strike a blow at tho confidence of theindustry, and drive resources away from the more essential tothe less essential kinds of building work.

11* It must also be recognised that the use of buildingcontrols to reduce the volume of work below the level of theresources actually available to and in use by the buildingindustry would be a new departure*   Hitherto the buildingcontrols have been employed solely to adjust the load to theresources of the industry and to alter the character of thework done within this total.   It will be recollected that anattempt two years ago to reduce the size of the building-industry proved completely abortive.   One of the reasons forthis failure was the unwillingness to restrict the amount ofnew work below the capacity of the building industry and to keep it restricted long enough to compel a transfer of resourceselsewhere.   In any event it would certainly be necessary to suspend the arrangement, which is at present in force, wherebyless  essential building works within the licenseable limitmay be authorised wherever a surplus of building labour islikely to arise.   Otherwise the Government would merely bereducing the more essential works with one hand andstimulating less essential works with, the other.   There is afurther difficulty to-day because the licensing limits havebeen raised.   One immediate result of restricting licensed orauthorised building would probably be the expansion of less essential work within the !;i&apos;ree1: limit, combined with some increase in black market building,12, The positive line of attack would, therefore, beto limit the demands made on the building industry and the strainsput on the licensing system by reducing the demand for investment in those sectors where demand can be speedily and effectively influenced by the Government, i,e, in the public sector and the social services.   It would be necessary by a simultaneous tightening up of the licensing system to.ensurethat the gains achieved in this way were not lost through an equivalent expansion of less essential building operations,PART II:    Detailed Analysis13* The rest of this report deals with the prospects of restricting total investment in the years 19*4-9/50 and 1950/51*It is now too late to alter in any effective way the level of investment for the current year 1949, since resources are alreadytoo far committed,lk* Likewise for 1950 a large part of the work due to becarried out has already been started or committed.   Thus in thecase of the electricity generating programme contracts havealready been entered into&apos; for the entire programme up to 1952and for part of the 1953 programme, and work lias already started on most of it.   Even in regard to investment with a shorterproduction cycle freedom of action is limited.   All houses, forexample, due for completion by next spring are already under construction and commitments have been entered into with localauthorities for a large part of the 1950 housing programme,though work may not have actually started.   At the other end ofthe scale much of the agricultural investment programme consists -of relatively small jobs begun and finished within the year.It Y/ould, nevertheless, still be possible .to adjust the voluraeof investment for 1950 by limiting new commitments yet to be entered into and by slowing down the rate at which new work is put in hand.   But it would be necessary to start doing soalmost at once and the full effect would not begin to be feltuntil the second half of next year,15* Some savings in 1950 could be made by adopting a morerestrictionist policy in the licensing of miscellaneous works,but no significant reduction of total investment can be achievedexcept by putting a brake on expansionist plans for 1951 and 1952,

By scaling down these -rising programmes sane jobs which would,otherwise get started in 1950 would not he put in hand.16* The nature and scale of the problem can &quot;be seen fromthe Table in.the Appendix to this report, which shows thotrend of investment as brought out by the last review made bythe Investment Programmes Committee *   It will be notedthat Departmental estimates suggested an increase over the levelachieved in 1948 of no less than  300 millions in 1950 rising to  500 millions in 1952.   The pressure of demand comes mainly from the public sector, as is shown by the following figures:-i	1948	1952	1952	1952		Depart-	as per	I.P.C.

It is by this approach and by allowing only a modest increase in the provisionfor        manufacturing industry that the Investment programmes committee in their recent report recommended cuts of  200 million for 1950 and  300 millions for 1952.   Tho. outs for 1950 havebeen provisionally approved with minor increases for education and certain Home Office services, thus reducing the prospectivetotal investment for that year from  2,326 millions to  2,123millions.   Final decisions on the recommendations for&apos;1952,which would reduce the proposed programme from  2,526 millions to  2,206 millions, have yet to be taken.17* The prospects of reducing the volume of investment for 1950 and later years below these levels turns on thefollowing factors:-(a)   The extent to which private firms and individuals -and also the public corporations - would be inducedspontaneously to limit their investment plansas a result of any general deflationary measures that may be adopted (paragraph 7 above).   no estimate can be placed on this.

(c)&apos; (a)(e)18.The consequential effects of the cuts in dollar imports which have yet to bo roprogrammed.    Iftimber imports from tho dollar area were cut by30 per cent, it is estimated that a reduction of thohousing programme by some 25,000 houses a yearcould be averted only by drawing down theemergency timber reserve by 50 per cent-   This,however, would be a temporary expedient and a cutwould have to be made eventually unless future. timber supplies improved.   Even so the positionwould be precarious and would depend, among other -things, on the substitution of inferior grades of timber in-order to get greater quantity, and onthe lowering of national timber stocks to a dangerouslevel.   Other import cuts will reduce supplies ofmachinery - directly to the extent of some 7 millions of imported equipment in 1949/50, and indirectly through the effect on engineering outputof the restricted supplies of steel and non-ferrous metals.Sizeable reductions, however, could come only from further retrenchment of the forward programmes of the socialised industries and the social services belowthe reduced levels already recommended by the investment Programmes Committee.   This wouldrequire (i) the postponement of some part of the major reorganisation and re-equipment schemes onwhich these industries are embarking, and (ii) some modification of existing policies in the social service field from which the investment programmes are merely derivatives.It..is assumed that no substantial savings should besought from investment in agriculture, shipping, ironand steel, and manufacturing industry in view of the direct and relatively quick contribution thatinvestment in these fields can make to our economic recovery.In parallel with the foregoing it would be necessaryto reimpose restrictions on the licensing of works in the category of miscellaneous building.The broad conclusions of this analysis are, therefore,as follows:-(i)   Cuts of the order of  300 millions in the investment programme for 1952 (as has already been recommendedby the Investment Programmes Committee in their last Report but not yet approved) will have to bemade, if the reduced level of investment alreadyprovisionally endorsed for 1950 is not to be exceeded.(ii)    If it is desired to cut the total volume of investment in 1950 and thereafter still furiter,some postponement of major re-organisation andre-equipment plans of the socialised industries will &quot;be necessary, and also sane modification ofexisting policies in the social service field,particularly in those services where rapidly expanding investment programmes are being contem-plated.   Ho detailed recommendations about the

incidence of such, further cuts can be made without full consultation with Departments, and before this is undertaken it would be necessaryto secure a prior decision in principle by theGovernment that a substantial total cut mustbe imposed, even if it involves consequences of the kind indicated above,(iii)   At the same time it would be necessary to ensurethat any savings achieved by these methods werenot frittered away by authorising less essentialworks in the interests of avoiding unemploymentin the industries which were immediately affectedby the cuts.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeW.
