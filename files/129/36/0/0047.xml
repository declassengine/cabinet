THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1949 .ASECRET Copy No. 31CP. (49) 197Qth October, 1949.CABINETTHE ECONOMIC SITUATION: PUBLICITY TO industry memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at the invitation of the Production Committee, I am circulating herewitha memorandum of proposals for a publicity campaign directed towards both sides of industry.2. When these proposals were considered by the Production Committee on 4th October (P.C. (49) 21st Meeting, Minute 1), it was not possible to reach afinal decision, because of a difference of view on the value of the proposed meetings with employers. Against the proposal, it was suggested that such meetings were unlikely to produce constructive and beneficial results, and would merely providea platform on which industrialists would be free to criticise Government policy,to the detriment of the productivity campaign. I myself, however, feel that to refrain from entering into discussions with the employers because of difficultiesof this kind would be to risk the charge of having abrogated our responsibilities.Moreover, our appeal to the Workers to co-operate in the measures required willbe very much diminished if any grounds are given for the belief that they aloneare being called upon to make special exertions and sacrifices.3. I therefore hope that the Cabinet will approve the proposed programme and authorise me to go ahead with the arrangements.R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1,Qth October, 1949.37671
SECRET[P.C. (49) 10329th September, 1949]ANNEXProduction Committee .PUBLICITY ON THE ECONOMIC situation memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer we are all agreed that steps must be taken quickly to rouse both sidesin industry to a full realisation of the present emergency and the actions it requires.To this end the Foreign Secretary, the President of the Board of Trade andI propose to address two national meetings, one of employers and the other of trades Unionists, in London, on two consecutive days, as soon as the foreign secretary returns.These meetings will be preceded by another with senior Civil Servantsconcerned with production.2. These national meetings can, and in my view should, become forerunnersof an intensive series of private conferences between Production Ministers andthe two sides in a substantial list of industries, some engaged in export and otherswith considerable influence on the general level of costs. This series was planned,and considered by officials, in August and plans were then deferred until theresult of the Washington talks was known.3. The officials concerned took the view that it is essential for such a driveto be preceded by a frank statement of the Governments attitude towards thenational emergency, the main issues of policy involved, and the measures required of both sides in industry. This has now been amply done in the three days&apos; debate in the House of Commons which has just taken place. The speeches at the twonational meetings will further serve this purpose. They can, if desirable, bepublished at the time, and then printed and distributed to the delegates at the later private conferences.4. Some of the officials have taken the view that any substantial improvementin productivity in the industries for which their Departments are responsiblewould result either in some general redundancy in these industries, or in the needfor greater mobility between one section and another. This matter has been dealtwith explicitly in the House of Commons debate. It is felt by some that anyfurther general statement by the Government on redundancy and mobility mightcreate or reinforce the impression that improved productivity was evidentlyassociated with increased unemployment and that the. better course would befor Ministers to deal with the question frankly and fully in private conferenceswith appropriate industries. In view of what has already been said I think thatthis matter should be dealt with in public, but I should be glad to know the viewsof my colleagues.5.   I would add the following further points : (a) Whatever earlier discussions with industry on these lines have takenplace, further action is now necessary. Devaluation has not altered the fundamental nature of the productivity problem, but it does createfor many industries new circumstances, new immediate tasks, anda new and greater need for speed. In this situation there are freshthings to be said. The report of the steel foundries&apos; group, whichrecently visited America shows how much there is to be done and how important it is to break through the complacency of British industry.(6) The socialised industries must be included in the scheme, both on merits and for obvious tactical reasons. There would be fully justifiedcriticism if we confined ourselves to energising the private sector ofindustry.(c) The prospect of some retrenchment and redundancy in a particular industry is no reason for not including it in our propaganda. Theneed for higher productivity in such industries is just as great, inthe national interest, and the need for frank discussion of the problemsof industrial mobility and redundancy is all the greater.  This is not
less true if the prospect of retrenchment arises from administrativeactions or policy decisions by the Government itself, such as cuts inthe investment programme.(d) The need for cost reduction applies not only to the industries in the fore-front of the export drive, but to many others, especially those indus-tries and services whose costs and prices play a large part in deter-mining the general level of industrial costs.6. The conferences with industries should get down to bedrock, and shouldnot be allowed to develop into a recital of reasons why nothing can be done. Thereis a good deal now to be said about costs, labour problems, market openings and methods of sales promotion. Special difficulties and individual cases can be examined in a spirit of determination to find a solution to the problems involved.I am sure that my colleagues will find means, in their addresses, to present thesituation so as to carry full conviction and convince their hearers of the needfor urgent action.7. At employers&apos; conferences the aim should, I suggest, be to get them to resolve formally to set up self-help panels or committees&apos;for the spread of technicalknow-how, and the sharing of information about matters like cost control, labourmanagement, &amp;c.8. At Trade Union Conferences, Ministers will be able to speak very franklyon the issues involved. They may be able to induce their audiences to set upTrade Union productivity committees with the immediate aim of implementing the resolution passed at the T.U.C.&apos;s conference with Union Executives on18th November, 1948. The education of the rank and file towards wholeheartedacceptance of the need for increased productivity has still far to go. It will be helpful if as a result of these conferences workers receive more active encourage-ment from their unions to co-operate with management in their own factories,works or mills in order to achieve higher productive efficiency. The need forrestraint in claiming increased personal incomes can also be emphasised, withchapter and verse.9. Conferences should be on the basis of works&apos; representation as far aspossible. They will need to be organised by Trade Associations and TradeUnions, and those bodies must, of course, sponsor the suggested self-help panelsand committees. But it is on the floor of the factory, works or mill that the policies advocated will be applied, and the closer we can get to the people ultimatelyresponsible, the more fruitful our discussions are likely to be.10. The whole of this programme must be carried through before the endof November at the latest as we must impress upon people the great urgency ofthe situation.R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1,29th September, 1949.
