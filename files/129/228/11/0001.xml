VERNMENTAL CONFERENCE ON POLITICAL UNION



YHfemorandum by the Secretary of State

&lt;Ytor Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs



1. The  Intergovernmental  Conference  on  Political  Union opens



formally in Rome 0   5) December. The negotiations will begin in

earnest early in Jantrij!wymd continue probably into the second half

of 1991.    OPD(E) and OPDj^n^ve discussed the key issues.



 



Handling the negotiations



2. The  United  Kingdom mu



constructive   part   in   the IG

changes which would produce real

changes where we have real intere

play our hand with skill,  not alway

can satisfactorily do so, and forming



ay  -  and be  seen  to  play  - a

We   should   propose   or support

while opposing undesirable

stake.     We shall need to

ing the lead where others

alliances as we can with

eas and fend off those we



other member states to promote our own

dislike. Our hand will be strengthened by the need for unanimity

to change the Treaty - but only if others believe that it is worth

negotiating seriously with us to achieve atav33Qtcome which all

member states can accept.



3. The Political Union T3C will be a leading^^teme at the

European Council on 14/15 December. Our preferred qj^m^tive, for

which we have lobbied hard, is to secure unanimousv^Mn&amp;lusions

which do not pre-empt the IGC itself. There remains ^??^?? risk,

however, that the Italians may persist in pushing for unacicra^ably

prejudicial conclusions, and that other members states may nqfc/frold

out  against  them.   If  so,   we will  need to  enter  a  short geri^aj

reserve,  together with a positive statement of our own approach to

e IGC.



are  four main  areas where we want  improvements  in the

unity arrangements to be agreed at the IGC.



of the Gulf crisis, US experience there will

:w debate about burdensharing; if we are to

the US commitment to European defence,

ed in Europe, we need to show that the

contributing   more    coherently and

agreed that we should maintain the

we should pre-empt the emergence

defence   structure   which would



W^r^^e a strong interest in strengthening European foreign

policy c^caS^ration and ensuring that it develops in a way that

strengthens/the European voice on the world stage without

undermining M:he Atlantic Alliance. There will be pressures in

the IGC to develop a European defence and security identity.

Whatever the outcitfiif

inevitably lead t

maintain the stren

including US troops

Europeans themselves

effectively. Colleagues

central role of NATO;

of   a   separate Community



weaken rather than strengtl^^^ie Alliance. We can make a

constructive contribution to the&lt;^irebkte by advocating greater co-

ordination of foreign and secutf? tej ) policy issues among the

Twelve, while building up the Westem^&amp;ropean Union as the focus

of the European defence identity witr^,n the Alliance, with links

to the Twelve. The WEU is our preferred forum for European

defence cooperation including independenjKx European military

activity outside the NATO area. I intendVJd^veloping these ideas

in discussion with EC colleagues.

b. We want better implementation and enforcement:\&lt;or&gt; Community

legislation by the member states, and more effect^YB^ineans of

. ensuring compliance with member states&apos; legal oo^Laations,

including compliance with European Court j udgment^O^^ ins t

them. The United Kingdom has a very good record iny^itese

respects, and it is in our interests to bring others up co/3em

mark. If progress can be made on these issues in the e^*^

stages of the negotiations,   it may get us on to some high*

ground and may just help dampen other member states&apos; enthusiasm

for far-reaching changes in other areas.



We want to insert in the Treaty a tight definition of

Ldiarity. with the aim of forcing the Community to confront

p^ri^v choices over what really needs to be done at Community

lev%&amp;//pnd what is much better left to the member states.

0 11^2 ^ ^&gt; are agreed that the objective is well worth pursuing,

providec^^^at a satisfactory definition of subsidiarity itself

can be ingratiated. There are more mixed views over the most

appropriate^ procedural mechanism for enforcing any Treaty

provision. OPD(E) will be considering the options in more

detail.  



  



d. We also wantY^tdA tighten control over the Commission, in

particular over how^amiaunity money is spent. We have some good

ideas for strengtheni^w^the role of the Court of Auditors in

investigating the Commxs^oja&apos;s financial performance, and giving

the European Parliament a^jstr^pnger role in calling the Commission

to account. ^&quot;^^^



5. OPD agreed that United King^^?%Toposals in these areas should

be tabled early in the IGC. &lt;?//&apos;?&gt;



%



Areas of difficulty (///



6. The areas where the negotiations are likely to be most

difficult for us are:



a.      Proposals  for extension of Community



ience in a wide



variety of areas, eg health, social polia#/// ftd education.

Colleagues have agreed that we should continue &lt; &lt;3^tkke the line

that we have not been persuaded that there is&lt;/ py\ case for

extending existing Community competence, while beircgx^eady to

examine the merits of specific proposals.



b.    We shall be under pressure to agree to extension of au^i^jed

majority   voting   and  here   too   colleagues   have   agreed th^ ^3

should  say  that  we  have  yet  to  be  convinced  of  the need



CONFIDENTIAL




CONFIDENTIAL



change,    though   we   shall   obviously   need   to   look   at specific

proposals on their merits.    The crucial question is whether, in

y  given  area,   a  move  to  qualified  majority voting would be

ely to operate to our overall advantage,  as has been the case

e Single Market,  agriculture and external trade issues, in

^like  taxation  and  social  questions,   we  have  always been

cle&quot;^^ijat majority voting would be against our interests.



c. Sonj^/^her member states will press hard for an enhanced

leqislat for   the   European   Parliament.    There   is a



widespread&lt;Rerception in the Community of a &quot;democratic deficit&quot;,

leading to arguments that this can only be filled by the European

Parliament. We have always argued that, while the European

Parliament has /af $ole to play, democratic accountability is

ensured by a CouSdilV) composed of Ministers who are personally

accountable to tS^r respective national governments and

parliaments. Most/Either   member   states   simply   do   not see



accountability to tneir) own parliaments as an effective

substitute for greater tratiocratic control through the EP. We

shall need to consider rhesfe\ issues more fully once it has

become clearer in the negotiations what the realistic options for

change might be, taking full a^p6m^t of the implications for our

domestic parliamentary traditidi*^/&gt; Meanwhile OPD(E) will be

looking at ideas for increasin^-^ involvement of national

parliaments, which we could put forK2(r^in the IGC.
