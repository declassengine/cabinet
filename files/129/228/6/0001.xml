ECONOMIC PROSPECTS



The UK economy

excessively fast?

continued through

and   supporting thi



Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer



still    suffering   the   after-effects    of the

h in domestic demand that began in 1986 and

d 1988.    By tightening   monetary policy,

a   fiscal surplus, we have succeeded in



restraining the growth ^H^temand more recently and the current

account deficit has beqj^^to fall modestly as British producers

have switched sales from domestic to foreign markets. But the

adjustment has not been as rapid as we - or others - expected and

inflation has continued to r * s^^anc* ^as now reached quite

unacceptable levels.



2.      The    large   current account de

contributed to nervousness in financ

over   the   past   year.    The firming of

welcome;    provided it persists, it will



(and rising inflation have

s at   various times

ing in recent weeks is

heU^inf lation   over the



next year, offering the prospect in due cEudi ? of some reduction

in interest rates. But confidence is bound to remain fragile for

some time, and we must make sure we do nothing that exacerbates

anxieties about either the performance of the UK economy or the

determination of the Government to achieve its obje^C



3.     One   important   reassurance for markets in the lal

has been the strength of our fiscal position and the emel

a   public    sector   surplus - coinciding of course with abc

economic growth.    But after a number   of   years   when the

position   was stronger than expected we may now face a period&apos;

it will be difficult to avoid a deterioration and a   rapid return

either to borrowing or to tax increases.

economy



ft world economy is emerging from a period of exceptionally

stro!^|ie^vity. G7 GNP grew in 1989 at 3*5 per cent, with US

growth ^^ing somewhat in response to the Fed ? s tight monetary

stance while growth in Japan and Germany was very strong.



5. The indicators for the first half of 1990 show these trends

continuing. In particular, while there has been a further easing

of   pressures    i^^fee   US,    a   recession   there   seems unlikely.



However, the

should lead to a

in   1990   to about 3

of potential output.



of   relatively   sluggish growth in the US

fall of G7 (excluding the UK) GNP growth

nt, close to our estimate of the growth



6. With pressure on capacity at a very high level in some

economies there is little chance of a significant reduction of

inflation in the G7. Indeed therejaust be a risk that in Japan

and Germany underlying inflatioAej^l drift up and it is possible

that there could be further incre^^ in short

rates.



7.     The   dramatic   events    in Eastern&apos;

particular, will have only a limited

perhaps   boosting   growth of world trade in&apos;



and in Germany in

the   short run

actures, which is



crucial for British exports, by h per cent in 1990. Overall,

world trade growth in 1990 is likely to be less than in the

previous three years, though faster than in the lat&lt;=. 1970s and

early 1980s.



The     economy



8.     We   have   maintained a very tight policy stance for tl

now with a budget surplus and real short term   interest rati

over   7 per   cent.    This has had a marked effect on the econoi

The latest figures show that after growing at 7 per cent in

real domestic demand has grown slowly since the end of 1988.

re upon capacity has eased and   unemployment   has   begun to

recent months.



?A



Ic^e%eless the adjustment has proceeded far more slowly than

we expected and the indicators for the first half of 1990 give

conflicting signals. Some indicators suggest that the necessary

slowdown in grov^h may have halted or even gone into reverse. On

the other hancAm^ryeys of company and personal sector intentions,

in particular, s^ppt only weak growth.

through 1989, picked u!



against previous expecta^^^^ The latest figures (for June) show

some fallback, though too much should not be made of one month&apos;s

data.



11. Elsewhere there are more definite signs of a slowdown in

consumer demand. Personal sector new car registrations have been

on a steep and uninterrupted downfc^^^trend since mid-1989, the

largest and most sustained fall sinc^^^B. Since early 1988,

consumer credit growth has slowed down and consumer confidence has

slumped to historically low levels. Distributors themselves see a

weak immediate outlook and their general opt^^%n regarding future

prospects has deteriorated noticeably. So, too, has the optimism

of manufacturers of consumer goods, as reported by

Industrial Trends Survey.



the CBI



12.    The prospects for companies are also uncertain,

sector   has   been running a very large financial defied

years.    In the past this would have led to a rapid adjus

;ion for early 1990 was unexpectedly buoyant. Taking 1990

a1&lt; ^?fee it looks as if fixed investment will be about the same

last^^^r, and that there will be only modest destocking. This

would imply a somewhat higher level of company spending than

expected at the time of the Budget. Nonetheless we cannot rule

out markedly lower company expenditure in the near future if

financial distress becomes more widespread and if companies take

more aggressiv^^^^sive measures to improve their finances.

and company sectors together the prospect

domestic demand in 1990, rather than the

time.    Total GDP is    still expected

thin the total domestic demand looks



stronger and net exports weaker than expected. Once again

estimates of North Sea production for this year have been

significantly reduced and this accounts for some of the weakening.



14.    With   domestic   demand strori

very encouraging particularly in maifiJR^uring, where we have

increased our share of world trade, but imports have also

continued to grow. Estimates of invisible ^^^ings have recently

been revised up, and the expectation is that for the year as a

whole the current account deficit will, at  16 billion, be only a

little above the FSBR forecast.



15. The strength of activity so far this year has coincided with

a further rise in inflation. Pay settlements have ris^^^fccongly,

though their effects on earnings have been offset so far^fc3?fc alls



in   overtime   working   and   bonuses.     CBI evidence shows

lation,    which   has risen strongly in recent months, so that we

well see a further rise in settlements later in the year.



acceleration in earnings has coincided with a downturn in

^ty growth, which is normal at this stage of the cycle,

suit there has been a sharp rise in the growth of wage

This, together with last year&apos;s fall in the exchange rate,

has led to a rise in underlying inflation. While there is no

unique   measure ^of   underlying inflation, the evidence is that it

17. Headline RPI inflation has risen to 9.8 per cent, boosted in

particular by mortgage interest rate rises and the very high

community charges set by local authorities. Both headline and

underlying inflation could rise further in the months ahead, with

the former possibly breaching 10 per cent in the next month or

two.    Thereafter underlying inf lati^^B^ald stop rising and then

inflation is likely still to be about

this year, despite the effects of last

rise dropping out of the inflation rate

through next year. Achieving a substantial reduction in

underlying inflation will require sufficient pressure on companies

to force them to curtail the rises in their prices #^^age costs.



18.    I forecast at Budget time a lower debt repayment

than   had previously been projected, and also indicated

return to budget balance, with smaller scope for   tax cut

PSDR in 1990-91 has so far been lower still, in large part,

the extent that local authority borrowing is the result of low

PSk. before the end of the financial year. But public

expei^gE^e J?s running ahead strongly and there are other adverse

developm^^s to come, such as lower than expected North Sea oil

production caused by shutdowns to install safety equipment. Our

current forecast is that the PSDR will be well below the

projection we ma$|e at the time of the Budget.



19. Some of

the effects of higher than expected

inflation and also somewhat more resilient domestic demand: both

these factors are helping to boost revenues this year, while the

main automatic impact wOjLgher inflation on expenditure (through

social security upratings^Pfcill not be felt until the next

financial year. But in the next two years or so the slowdown in

the economy is likely to hit payments of company and capital

taxes, both of which have grown v&amp;ry rapidly in recent years. As

a result of all these factors we fe^i&amp;d well see what remains of

the budget surplus evaporating as rapidly as it appeared.



Conclusion



:: .



20. I&apos;m afraid this is a very bleak baiB|^1nd against which to

assess changes to the existing public expenS^d^ plans. It will

not be possible, as in previous years, to add to public

expenditure plans in the reasonable expectation that buoyant tax

revenues will offset the effect on the PSDR. Indeed it could pose

the hard choice between tax increases next year a|A^ damaging

relaxation of policy. It is essential, therefore, that we follow

the recommendations on public expenditure in the Chief%^^^tary&apos; s



paper,

ntually reducing it. But commentators and markets will be

looking closely to see that our resolve does not weaken. It will

do immense harm if we are seen to be restraining demand in the

prije^sector while letting it grow strongly in the public

control^^^ should be able to establish and retain market

confidence, and this should lead eventually to some reduction in

interest rates.
