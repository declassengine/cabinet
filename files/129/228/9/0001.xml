1990 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY

overriding, and that strict c

should   be   maintained   by s

existing plans with the aim  

expenditure    (excluding privati

trend as a proportion of GDP.



Progress in bilaterals



3. At the start of the bilaterals, the bids totalled some

 17% billion for 1991-92 rising to  22% billion and  28

billion for the following two years.



4. The additions to programmes agreed with co

 11 billion,     14.1   billion and  16.7 billion,

will be found from the Reserves built    into existin



The   additions include the  2*5 billion cost of the setl



for local authorities announced in July and   other addtf



to   programmes   agreed before the Survey which, as I repoj

to colleagues at that time, amount to some  1*5 billion in

1991-92. Also included is a  3 billion addition to demand-

led Social Security expenditure, mainly the cost of uprating

benefits in line with the September RPI. These additions

Ital around  7 billion in 1991-92.     The   remaining bids



over  10 billion - have been reduced in the Survey to

 4 billion.



5. This is a tight settlement. I am grateful to colleagues

for scaling down their bids so sharply and for finding

offsetting jsavings. This has inevitably required some

difficult decisions



6.     The ta

reached with

description of e



Annex   A   records the settlements I have

gues.     Annex           provides     a brief

ttlement.



additions ^to^^rogrammes are concentrated in three

main areas: Social Se&apos;Wiirity, increased central government

support for local authorities and health, where the

settlement should deliver a real increase in NHS resources of

over 5 per cent in 1991-92,  ^%ping the smooth introduction

of the NHS reforms.



8.      This has left very little

programmes,    but   we   have been



for   adding   to other

find money for some



limited increases: to fund the record^M^^r of students in

higher education; for policies described in the White Paper

on the environment; and to increase ina^%nent in public

transport, including spending over the next three years on

the East West Crossrail, the Jubilee Line, and rail safety.

Other relatively inexpensive but politically attractive

measures include extra resources to complete the^^fclessness



package   agreed   by   MISC    143; for increased aid

Europe; and increased spending   on   youth training

Local Initiative Funds for TECs.

9. To accommodate these improvements it has been necessary

to hold back spending in other areas. I am particularly

grateful   to   those   colleagues   who have settled at or below



[seline. Despite significant reductions in Employment

.ning the employer-led TECs will be able to spend more

rear than they are likely to spend this year, and with

mo^^^iiscretion over how they spend it. A substantial

downward revision to the prison population projections means

we can save significant sums on prison building, but there

are extra resources for refurbishing existing prisons

(including^J^angeways) .



10. The review of defence policy will provide increasing

savings in the^tei^Uce Budget from 1992-93 onwards. This is

without detrimel^^^eo the UK&apos;s military contribution to

resolving the Gulf crisis. Over the next three years, the

plans provide for  %? cent real reduction in the Defence

Budget and further redKtions should be achieved in future

years as &quot;Options for Change&quot; are fully implemented. By

1993-94 spending on Defence should be some 3.4 per cent of

GDP, compared with 5 per cent^^^l982-83



Capital Spending



11. The new plans include extS^Mkcovision for capital

spending by central government (excluding Defence) amounting

to around  3/4 billion a year. Ther^Hftk also additions of

nearly  2h billion over three years to  tu^^^apital spending

of nationalised industries remaining in the public sector

throughout the period. Capital investment in transport -

road and rail - will rise by  lk billion between 1990-91 and

the end of the Survey period, 20 per cent in reak^ms. The

new plans also include provision for extra suppoWj^r local

authority capital spending on schools, local ^Xiteport

schemes and housing renovation.

Running costs and manpower



12. Bids of  1.8 billion in 1991-92 and  1.9 billion and

flk.5 billion for the next two years have, with colleagues&apos;

help, been reduced by one third. The cash increase between

^Bfc^^ear and next is 11 per cent. Efficiency gains agreed

f 01-92 9^^^? average over 2 per cent, and Civil Service

numbers will be at least 3000 below published plans, despite

the extra 7000 sought in the bids.



1990-91       



13. The planning total for 1990-91 was set at  179.0

billion, incluAw^Reserve of  3.0 billion. The estimated

outturn is now  180.6 billion, an overspend of  1.6 billion

or just under 1 pefifH :. A large part of this can be

attributed to subs1^i.tAlly increased financing requirements

for the nationalised iiKustries, Gulf costs and higher than

expected CAP market support costs.

Changes agreed in Survey are as agreed in bilaterals (before subsequent transfers

between Departments). Autumn Statement will show changes from previous White Paper

with figures adjusted to reflect classification changes and to remove

distortions created by certain large switches of responsibility between

Departments.



Baselines are as current at the time of bilaterals. Baselines for



Autumn Statement calculations reflect certain minor adjustments and classification



changes.

Additions in 1991-92 provide for payments to pre-1973 war widows,

announced in December 1989, and for some reprofiling of expenditure

from 1992-93. The reductions in 1992-93 and 1993-94 follow the

Defence Secretary&apos;s &apos;Options for Change&apos; proposals in July 1990, on

which detailed work is continuing, to reduce the armed forces in the

light of the improved security situation in Europe.

Programme broadly unchanged in cash terms. Spending on RSA, the

Consultancy Initiative and regional enterprise grants has been cut

back but there are increases for shipbuilding subsidies (due to

interest rates) and regional development grants. Additions for

ECGD largely effect of higher interest rates on costs of fixed rate

Programme additions are for national roads (Red Routes in London,

driver information, and faster progress on motorway widening), local

roads (mainly safety-related minor works), local public transport

(enabling one major light rail scheme to go ahead), and the child

safety campaign. Reduced provision for local airports, to encourage

more private sector participation.



Transport nationalised industries Combined EFLs for British Rail,

London Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority increased by over

50 per cent between 1990-91 and 1991-92. In the three Survey years

investment by British Rail will be nearly 60 per cent more in real

terms than the previous 3 years and will allow for a substantial

increase in safety investment. A large proportion of the overall

increase can be attributed to Channel tunnel investment and there is

a smaller increase in investment on the existing railway. Planned

investment by LT will be doubled in real terms compared with the

previous 3 years, including initial provision for the Jubilee Line

Extension and East West Crossrail.

including significant sums for waste-disposal projects and running

costs, derelict land grant and heritage, including cathedrals.

Extra provision for inner cities expenditure, includes the Northern

UDCs. The increases are partly offset in 1992-93 by higher net

receipts from the disposal of commercial property in New Towns.

between 1990-91 and 1991-92); and improvements in Community Charge

Transitional Relief (in England, brings up to 4 million extra people

into relief and benefits up to 11 million or more by up to  1 a

week). Both measures were announced in July. Substantial increases

also for years 2 and 3.



Home Office +363 +448 +625



The agreed additions provide for a real increase of just over 5 per

cent in the Home Office&apos;s planned provision between 1990-91 and

1991-92; an increase in the programme to divert offenders from

custody; meeting increasing demands on immigration and passport

services; and a new immigration detention centre. Reductions in

prison building programme reflect substantially lower forecasts of

the prison population, but more funds for refurbishment and for

Strangeways to be put right. Grants to local authorities to

increase by over  200 million, allowing an increase in the number of

police officers and a substantial rise in spending on police

vehicles and other equipment.



Legal Departments +101 +129 +172



For Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department, additions provide for an increase

in legal aid to meet rising demand, more resources to handle

additional county court current business (mainly divorce and debt),

to continue the Lord Chancellor&apos;s civil and competition policy

initiatives and to meet rising accommodation costs, notably rents

and basic maintenance. For other legal departments, additions also

reflect rising accommodation costs, an improved recruitment and

retention of lawyers and increased capacity to prosecute higher

levels of criminal cases reported by the police.

higher education students next year, compared to 1990-91; increases

in student loans maintain the real value of total student support.

Support for schools capital and FE colleges should maintain 1990-91

level of capital spending. Also allows for Science budget spending

next year to continue at 1990-91 real level after allowance is made

for adjustment in the payment of post graduate fees and savings on

Agreed additions provide for real year on year increases of 5 per

cent in 1991-92, and 0.9 per cent in 1992-93 and 1993-94. Most of

the addition is for Hospital and Community Health Service current

spending to allow continued service growth in first year of the NHS

reforms and an increase in net capital provision. Provision for the

drugs bill, reflecting savings from Government initiatives on

prescribing, is substantially below last year&apos;s baseline, but still

allows real growth averaging 3 per cent a year over the period.

Agreement has been reached on a three year departmental running

costs settlement.
