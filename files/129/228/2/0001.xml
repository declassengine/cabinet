Following

le exceptional growth   in    1987    and    1988,    we   saw a

year     in   both   consumer   demand   and business

3wever,    demand   proved   more   resilient   than we

^:ime last year.    The current account deficit rose



in 1989; the ^^^emained stuck at lh per cent or more (around

6 per cent excluding mortgage interest payments); and in the

labour market, earnings growth increased and unemployment

continued to falljfc^^^i result we were obliged to raise interest

rates by a further 2 per cent,

consumer   confidence   provide .further   evidence   that   demand is

slowing down; and the forei

forecast is that, provided we

further slowdown this year with ei

deficit and, in due course, an eas

line   with most outside forecasts,

considerable uncertainty; growth in



example, remains uncomfortably high and^?E re is always a danger

of market turbulence. Moreover, the rate of inflation is bound to

rise in the next few months and remain high until well into the

Autumn. The prospect for 1990 is therefore ^n unappealing

combination of low growth, possibly rising

3. In the circumstances, I am sure that we must maintain a

cautious approach in the Budget as well as in monetary policy,

while   continuing   our   policies   to   improve   the   efficiency and



lexibility of the economy.    If we do so I have no doubt that our

nomic   performance   over   the   next   decade   can be at least as

ssful as in the 1980s, and probably more so.



world economy



4. The world economy grew rapidly in 1988 and 1989, but GNP and

world tr^j^^have been slowing during 1989 in response to higher

interest rates worldwide. Within the Group of Seven growth has

slowed mos-8T|^^ North America, while in West Germany and other

European econoKeaactivity has remained strong throughout 19 89.

G7 growth is expected to slow a little further in 1990, though the

scale of the slowdown is likely to be modest when compared with

the downswings  ^f\ 1970s and early 1980s - a soft landing.

Events in Eastern Eur0j|^^w?ill tend to boost world trade and

output, but are unlikely to have significant effects in the short

term.



5. Consumer price inflationAB^risen in all G7 economies, but

remains on average some way below underlying inflation in the UK.

Because monetary policy is now tighter worldwide than in 1988, and

GNP growth is forecast to ease, comm^L: price inflation in the G7

should fall gradually over the comin^^^r, from 4^ per cent now

to 3H per cent by the end of the year. Real non-oil commodity

prices fell during 1989 , and a further 3^Q^fall may occur this

year: in contrast oil prices rose duri!4^1T89 and the beginning

of this year.



Demand, output, and unemployment



6. In the UK, domestic demand - the sum   of con

investment   and stockbuilding - grew by 5% per cent

the four years to 1989.    Over the same period non-oil

over    4^ per cent.    Growth in both domestic demand and

rates is some way above the growth of productive capacity in the

economy, and faster than over any four year period since the war.



Growth on this scale was in part the result of an investment

Business investment grew rapidly from the mid-1980s, and by

10 per cent in each of the last three years. A higher rate

rn on capital, now back to its highest level for over

twenty years, and the creation of an environment that encourages

enterprise, contributed to this remarkable surge in investment,

which is already enhancing the supply potential of the economy.

While we | Ated investment and productivity to benefit from our

policies, ^e^me expected a boom on the scale that actually

occurred.



8. Consumer sp^^Ag has also grown very rapidly - by over 5 per

cent per annum on average over the four years to 1989. The

confidence generate ^  ^.sing wealth and incomes since the early

1980s has been reflect^^ni a sharp reduction in the saving ratio,

associated with higher borrowing. Consumers are in a better

position to arrange their spending and borrowing as they wish, now

that the controls on the financ^^. system in place until the 1970s

have been lifted.



9.     A   sharp   slowdown in deman

period of excessive growth and th&apos;

generated.     Recently there have bee1

adjustment is indeed occurring. Cons

in   the   last   three months   the volum



learly necessary after this

lationary   pressures thus

welcome signs that this

ending has slowed, and

etail sales was only



lh per cent higher than a year earlier. 5c looks as if business

investment may have peaked in the middle of 1989. Industrial

output has also slowed down, and capacity constraints have eased.



10.    Domestic demand may well fall a little in

expenditure   is    forecast   to   follow   the trend of

rising only very slowly as the personal sector adjus

their stocks and cut their capital expenditure by a modest amount.

After so powerful an investment boom it is not at all surprising

that in the very short term some retrenchment is likely.



While   domestic    demand may fall slightly, net exports should



J&apos;nue to grow strongly, sustaining the growth of output. I

no reason to change the forecast of GDP growth I made in the

Au umn Statement - just under 1 per cent. GDP growth at this rate

would in normal circumstances le^d to a rise in unemployment. But

while the monthly path for unemployment could be on a rising

trend du:utf^ much of the year, unemployment may be lower on

average irt^i     kthan in 1989.



iwtfjk mu



12. The prec   ^ming and extent of any rise in unemployment

will depend crucially on how companies react to high wage demands.

They already face a difficult financial position. With a tight

policy stance the^^trail have limited scope for passing on cost

increases in higher pi^^B^ If they allow wages and unit labour

costs to accelerate, many are likely to face a severe squeeze

later in the year, which in turn could lead to sharper cutbacks in

employment, investment, and stocks.



13.    Clearly there is great un

growth and unemployment when

It   looks   as if GDP growth will m

actually falling.    But the uncertain&apos;

possible   to   rule   out   a fall in ou

14.    The   excessive   growth   of demand and output

caused considerable strain in the economy, with

constraints     emerging   in   a   number   of Industrie

inflationary   pressure.     One   symptom   was   the curr

deficit   of    just   over  20 billion in 1989.    Another wa

unwelcome rise in RPI inflation - to over 8 per cent between April

and July last year. While the inclusion of mortgage interest

payments in the RPI makes it a distorted measure of underlying

onsumer price inflation, the latter also rose - to just over

er cent.



l^^^%e cannot be content with an underlying inflation rate of

over 6 per cent. The fact that RPI inflation has consistently

been below the levels recorded under the last Labour government is

small consolation in either economic or political terms. Our

perf ormangdBe still markedly worse than our major overseas

competito^^^JBie remain committed to the further reduction of

inflation, fflrid anv rise in it, however modest by historical

standards, reqmr^a firm policy response.



16. RPI inf latidj&amp;efci likely to rise to over 8 per cent in the

next month or so ane^fe^mlikely to come down very far until well

into the autumn. q^^^ontributory factor is the recent rise in

mortgage rates. And a number of special factors, of which the

introduction   of the community charge at   unjustifiably high rates



is the most notable, will also

results, and both

17. We are also likely to see progress in reduc^^^fche current

account deficit. Companies have clearly already switched

production to overseas markets as domestic demand ^e^kcapacity

constraints have eased; exports of non-oil goods hS^j^^sen by

15 per cent over the last year.    Because   world   trade g]M

likely to fall a little, export growth may be somewhat slower over

the coming year than in recent months; but it should nevertheless

remain higher than import growth which has already fallen. As a

esult the prospect is for a fall in the current account deficit

1990, broadly in line with the Autumn Statement forecast of

)illion.



Monetary developments



18. Concern about inflationary pressures and the slow response of

the econuiAto the tightening of policy, together with political

uncertainties at the end of 1989 and a strong deutschemark, led to

a fall in tlrb sterling index of just over 10 per cent during 1989.

Recently sterlKgeias firmed, and returned to the level of last

Autumn. But that is still over 8 cent below its level at the

beginning of 1989. This has added to upward pressure on costs and

prices. Growth of^^ifcs been above its target range since April

1988; and broad money an&amp; credit have continued to grow

rapidly.



19. Against this background, m^ietary policy was tightened during

19 89, with two increases of l^XJcent in the general level of

short-term interest rates. Mo^HLe rates also rose during 1989,

and have risen further in the la%^^ days to a level nearer

their normal relationship with rates. (The most recent

increase in mortgage rates will not immediately affect those whose

monthly payments are fixed under annual schemes and have already

been set for 1990.) Unpopular as these^islL have been, they are

having their desired effect, with an *nustment in the housing

market a necessary part of the process of restraining domestic

demand. We shall have to keep interest rates high until inflation

is clearly back on a downward track; it would be fpy.y to lower

them prematurely and then be forced to raise them{

Public finances



20. It    now    looks as if the PSDR for 1989-90 will be a good deal

wer than the  12*5 billion I forecast in   the   Autumn Statement,



h was itself below the  14 billion expected at budget time and

14*5 billion recorded last year. There are a number of

factors behind the shortfall: on the expenditure side, the outturn

is expected to be over  2 billion higher than planned, with

privatisation proceeds lower than expected, and a surge in capital

expenditure and borrowing by local authorities seeking to

forestall tighter controls that will apply next year; and on



the revenue side, corporate tax payments have been lower, and - as

a result of our policy on personal pensions - rebates have been a

little under j^MMllion higher than expected. These adverse

influences have been offset only partially by higher income tax

receipts than expected.



21. Looking forward 15^^-^90-91, there are a number of factors

which will tend to reduce the PSDR further. Some tax changes

announced in earlier Budgets have not yet had their full effect:

independent taxation, which 1*as announced in the 1988 Budget,

comes into effect in April; and PSDR will reflect the full year

effect of the reform of National Insurance Contributions which

came into effect last October. same time, the cyclical

slowdown in the economy will reduce the growth of tax revenue,

particularly from companies, and inc^SJ^the upward pressure on

public expenditure. I expect to see a smaller surplus in 1990-91

than this year, and a quicker fall from\dl|t surplus to budget

balance than envisaged in last year&apos;s MTF^r



Conclusion



22.    After   two   years in which the economy had b

unsustainably rapid rate, there are now clear signs

This    is   to   be   expected,    and   indeed   welcomed p&apos;

resumption of steady growth.

23.    But progress on inflation will   be    slower.      If   we    are to

succeed    in   getting    inflation   down,    fiscal policy must support

monetary policy.    This means a cautious Budget, with little if any

ope for reducing tax rates or other reliefs.

I have endeavoured to set out all the difficulties before us

  ^ ^  paper. But I see no need for excessive pessimism. By

next year I do expect a lower trade gap, lower inflation and

rising growth.    But that does depend on our policies this year.

^*ation, Expenditure and Borrowing



Since the Government first took office, total taxes and NICs have

risen by 3*5 percentage points of GDP, though the ratio has fallen

from its peak in 1981-82. This has enabled us to make net

repayments of government debt in the last three years.

Personal Taxation



Despite reductions in income tax, total personal taxes (direct and

indirect, including employees&apos; NICs and domestic rates) in 1989-90

are over  30 billion higher in real terms (ie 1989-90 prices) than

they were in 1978-79. For income tax and national insurance

contributions the following table shows how the proportion of gross

pay they represent rose up to 1981-82:

These figures reflect the rise in the standard employees&apos; NIC rate

from Sh per cent to 9 per cent followed by the cut in the rate on

earnings below the LEL to 2 per cent in 1989. The lower rates

introduced in the 1985 Finance Act do not affect the cases shown.

So far as income tax is concerned, personal allowances have

increased by about 24 per cent in real terms since 1978-79,

slightly less than earnings. The basic rate has been reduced from

33p to 25p.



Average earnings have of course increased by substantially more

than prices since 1978-79. So a married man on average earnings

has seen his real take-home pay rise by  54 per week. The increase

for a married man on half average earnings has been  26 per week,

and on twice average earnings  110 per week.



As the table shows, indexation of allowances in the Budget, with no

reduction in the basic rate, would lead to a slight fall in the

proportion of incomes taken in tax and NICs. This is because 1990-

91 sees the effect of the October 1989 NIC reform throughout the

year,    whereas    the financial year average figure given for 1989-90

includes half a year of the old system. If the post-October figure

were looked at for 1989-90, indexation would lead to a very slight

rise in the proportion of incomes taken in tax and NICs. This is

because earnings are assumed to rise by more than the increase in

tax thresholds, which is indexed to changes in prices.



business Taxation



Following the sharp rise in corporation tax receipts since 1983-84,

as a result of the substantial recovery in company profits, total

taxes paid by businesses (outside the North Sea) are now higher as

a percentage of GDP than in 1978-79. The rise in total taxes on

business as a share of GDP was made up of a large rise in

corporation tax and smaller rises in other taxes; employers&apos; NICs

and NIS fell.

ANNEX 4:    ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF GERMAN MONETARY UNION

Introduction



Current indications are that monetary unification may follow soon

after the GDR elections on 18th March. Details are unclear, but

it is likely that for a short period Ostmarks cash balances would

be converted to Deutschemarks, while savings balances would also

be converted, perhaps at a lower rate or with some restraint on

liquidity. A rescue package involving substantial FRG expenditure

in the East on housing and other infrastructures and on income

support is also likely. A gradual process of economic integration

and convergence would follow. There will be some impact on the UK

and other European economies.



2. The GDR is both relatively small and backward. It has a

population of 16 million compared with 61 million in the FRG, GNP

of perhaps 10 per cent and productivity below one half of FRG

levels, though GNP statistics are virtually meaningless.



Effects on Germany



3. The flow of immigrants from the East, now running at an

annual rate of about 700,000 a year, threatens economic collapse

in the East and social problems in the West. Both the speed with

which living standards in the East can be raised and the

availability of jobs and affordable accommodation in the West will

influence the chances of stemming the flow. In the early stages a

key factor will be the rate at which Ostmarks are converted. A

low figure, for example 4:1, reduces East German purchasing power

and does little to remove the incentive to move West. A high

figure would mean high wage costs in the East and increase

unemployment there.



4. Conversion of Ostmark cash balances to Deutschemarks would

raise the money supply by a small amount. Since there would also

be extra East German activity, this aspect of monetary union need



CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTTAT



not be inflationary. However, extra expenditure out of Ostmark

savings balances held for want of goods to buy could add to demand

pressure if full convertibility at a high rate were allowed. And

the expected increase in government expenditure and private

investment together with the liberalization of wages and prices in

the East also point to some increase in inflationary pressure.

The Bundesbank will be keen to extinguish this, so a rise in

German interest rates seems quite likely. German long bond rates

have risen by over 1 per cent since the beginning of the year,

perhaps in anticipation of a rise in short rates.



5. The German current account surplus, currently running at

about 4*5 per cent of GNP, may fall substantially as a result of

the extra expenditure. But there may be increased capital inflows

associated with the higher investment. On balance, and especially

in the short term, there may be a boost to the Deutschemark,

perhaps with a period of turbulence. Overall, this adds up to a

more difficult background for the operation of German economic and

monetary policy, but one that is manageable given the

authorities&apos;, particularly the Bundesbank&apos;s, skill in economic

management and their anti-inflationary credibility.



Implications for the UK and other European economies



6. In the short run the main impact of monetary unification

outside Germany will be felt through interest and exchange rates.

Higher Deutschemark interest rates, which may lead to a

strengthening of the Deutschemark in the short run, would not be

welcome for the UK. A fall in sterling against the Deutschemark

(and against all ERM currencies if there is no realignment), would

imply a fall in the sterling effective rate, putting upward

pressure on UK inflation.



7. In the slightly longer term the UK and the other West

European economies (above all, those with spare capacity) may

benefit from increased German domestic demand leading to greater

export   opportunities,    both directly in Germany and indirectly in



CONFIDENTIAL



- 2 -


CONFIDENTIAL



other countries as German exports are diverted to the home market.

The UK and other European economies would also share in the

increased investment in East Germany, although this effect is

unlikely to be large.



rQ^nlusions



8. Monetary unification could set off a period of greater

uncertainty in Germany, the economy that has had the lowest

inflation and greatest monetary stability in Europe. But it would

be wrong to exaggerate the likely magnitudes. The enlarged

Germany is likely to grow faster and have a lower current account

surplus than has the FRG over the last decade. This would be

beneficial to the world economy, especially the main trading

partners in Europe.
