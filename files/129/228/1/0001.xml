4. They &lt; ^Sfsider that the level of recommended increases for

all groups\^ too high and that it is essential to restrain them.

They propose that this should be done by staging the

recommendations and that the general approach should be to pay an

increase of 7 percent from 1 April 1990 and the balance from 1

January 1991. /xmntemented on the basis described below this

would  mean  that\^lje^average  increase   in  the pay bill   for all

rnment rejected last year for extra increases at the top of

sultants    scale   and   in   the   size   of   A+   awards for

ants.     Ministers propose that the recommendations should

cent hiOTWC^fchan for hospital doctors and is intended to pay the

average GMVV^or the additional work expected under the new

contract craMmg into effect from 1 April. For GMPs achieving

higher targets for immunisation and cervical screening there

could be further payments, included in the staging, amounting to

0.8 per cent of average net remuneration. The increase in the

ANNEX A



Draft Written Answer

The 1990 reports of the Review Bodies on the pay of Nursing

Staff, Midwives and Health Visitors, the Professions Allied to

Medicine, the Doctors and Dentists, and the Armed Forces, and of

the Top Salaries Review Body, have been published today. Copies

are now available in the Vote Office. The Government is

grateful to members of the review bodies for these reports and

the time and care which they have put into their preparation.



The following table shows the overall increases recommended by

the Review Bodies for each group, and their cost:



Pay bill Range of UK public (1)



increase increase expenditure

(1) The figures for public expenditure cost differ from those in

the Review Bodies&apos; reports. Their figures do not include some

costs which count as public expenditure.



(2) Payments to GPs for achieving higher targets for

immunisation and cervical screening are recommended by the Review

Body as outside intended average remuneration. The payments

would add some 0.3% to the total pay bill and are included in the

 423 million.



(3) A very few young staff would receive higher increases of up

to 19.7%.



(4) These figures assume that the additional increase of 10%

recommended for Groups 5-7 of the judiciary is phased over two

years, with 5% paid on 1 April 1990.


CONFIDENTIAL - CMO Until 2 February 1990



The Government considers that the overall pay cost implied by

the recommendations for 1990-91 would be too high. It has

therefore decided that the general approach should be to

implement the recommendations in full but to stage them so that

most groups receive an increase of 7% from 1 April 1990 with the

balance from 1 January 1991.



In the case of the Review Body on armed forces the Government has

decided to accept the recommendations but their implementation

will be staged so that 7% is payable from 1 April 1990 and the

remainder from 1 January 1991.



The Government has decided to accept with two exceptions the

recommendations of the Review Body on doctors and dentists, but

to stage their implementation so that 7% is payable in all cases

from 1 April 1990 and the remainder from 1 January 1991. The

exceptions are the recommendations which the Government rejected

last year for extra increases at the top of the consultants&apos;

scale and in the size of consultants&apos; distinction awards. It is

still the Government&apos;s view that the additional 100 permanent

consultant posts which are now being created will best achieve

the objective of improving the long-term career structure for

hospital doctors.



The Government has decided to accept the recommendations of the

Review Body on nursing staff, midwives and health visitors but to

stage their implementation so that from 1 April 1990 7% is

payable to all and in addition the recommendation for changes in

London pay and some extra increases in the pay of student nurses

take effect from that date. The rest of the increases

recommended will apply from 1 January 1991.



The Government has decided to accept the recommendations of the

Review Body on professions allied to medicine but to stage their

implementation   so   that   from   1   April   1990   7%   is  payable to


CONFIDENTIAL - CMO Until 2 February 1990



everybody and in addition the recommendations for changes in

London pay take effect. The rest of the increases recommended

will apply from 1 January 1991.



The Government has decided to accept the recommendations of the

Top Salaries Review Body but to stage their implementation. The

basic increase of 7% recommended for all groups will be payable

as to 6% from 1 April 1990 and 1% from 1 January 1991. In

addition, for senior civil servants, the abolition of the fixed

scale increments for Grades 2 and 3 will take effect from 1 April

1990; the increases in the London Allowance for Grade 3, and the

consequential increases for Grade 2, will take effect from 1

January 1991; and the new performance pay scheme for Grades 2 and

3 will be introduced from 1 April 1991. For two and three star

officers, the additional increases of 2.75% will take effect from

1 January 1991. For judges, the extra increase of 10%

recommended for those in Groups 5 to 7 will be staged with

payments on 1 January 1991, 1 August 1991 and 1 April 1992.



The cost of implementing all the recommendations on this basis

will be met from within the public expenditure planning totals

published in the Autumn Statement. In the case of the health

services the Government recognisesthat the full costs could not

be accommodated within present health provision without

adversely affecting services to patients. The Government has

therefore decided to provide an extra  205 million from the

Reserve for next year. This payment will bring the increase in

the total resources available for the National Health Service in

1990-91 over 1989-90 to  2.9 billion.



The pay rates and scales resulting from the decisions will be

promulgated as soon as possible for all the groups concerned.

Pensions will follow the rates of salary in payment.

ANNEX  



DRAFT PQ ON IAC ANNOUNCEMENT



[Mr J Pawsey]: To ask the Secretary of state for Education and

Science, if he has yet received the report of the Interim

Advisory Committee on teachers&apos; pay and conditions in 1990-91.



MR JOHN MACGREGOR



I have now received the third report of the Interim Advisory

Committee on School Teachers&apos; Pay and Conditions. Its main

recommendations are



- a new main scale for classroom teachers providing wide

ranging new local discretions, with increases for individual

teachers ranging from 6.4% to 11.8% and an average increase

of 8.3%



- a new system of range pay for heads and deputies with

increases ranging from 9.9% to 11.2% and an average increase

of 10.4%



- a 17% increase in the value of B, C, D and   incentive

allowances and an 8% increase in the value of A allowances



- an extra 14,400 incentive allowances for the 1990-91

academic year



- an 8.8% increase in London allowances from 1 July 1989



- a new discretionary inner London supplement of  750 a year



The Committee has now been in operation for three years. It has

produced an outstanding report. Its recommendations address all

the very important issues I asked it to consider when setting

this year&apos;s remit.    They should help substantially to ensure the


CONFIDENTIAL - CMO Until 2 February 1990



recruitment, retention and motivation of sufficient teachers of

the quality we need to meet the demands of delivering our

education reforms. They target resources where they are most

needed, enhance flexibility and local discretion, improve career

prospects, reward responsibility and good work, and make the

profession more attractive to intending teachers. I propose to

accept all the Committee&apos;s recommendations but, as announced

today for groups covered by the Review Bodies, to stage their

introduction over the period up to 1 January 1991.



I propose to increase all the pay scales by about 7% and all

incentive allowances by about 8% as from 1 April 1990. I propose

to implement from the same date the IAC&apos;s proposals for a new

inner London pay supplement and backdated increases in London

Weighting allowances. The extra 14,400 incentive allowances

proposed by the IAC would be introduced from 1 September 1990, as

the Committee has recommended. The Committee&apos;s recommendations
