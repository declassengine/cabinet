1990 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY



Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury



The control c^e^blic expenditure has been one of the great success

stories of tffll^UAvernment. Before the 1979 Election we promised to

reduce spendin^^ft^^share of national income. Our record in doing

so has enabled ^!s^^bo cut taxes and transform the public sector&apos;s

finances. These achievements have earned us a high reputation in

financial markets      and abroad. They were hard won, and, as

John Major and I have :^pAtedly warned, holding on to them in

present circumstances  1 require considerable determination,

is of the first importance that we do so.

&gt;und to this year&apos;s Survey is set

jing down inflation must be our

*main   tight,    in   support of

|Budget, we projected a small



fiscal surplus for 1991-92, with lim15|F%cope for tax cuts. The

latest figures suggest a rather worse fiscal prospect. It will not

be possible, as in previous years, to    ^fco public expenditure

plans in the reasonable expectation that^a^ant tax revenues will

offset the effect on the PSDR. If we are to avoid a damaging

relaxation in fiscal policy, or an increase in taxes in the 1991

Budget, we must keep additions to the planning tota^^this Autumn to

the absolute minimum. ^M^t.



3. Some increase in public expenditure is alreac^^Tmvoidable.

As I warned in April, the limited room for drawing down the Reserves

over the Survey period has already been exhausted. Highej^KflUation

will add substantially to demand-led social security    ^     .

The very large increase in Aggregate External Finance foa^PoKal

authorities decided by E(LG) thus implies large additions to the

planning totals for 1991-92 and later years.

4.       The   generous   and unprecedented AEF settlement&apos;is a political

*cessity.    The scope for meeting other   political   priorities will

:efore   depend   critically   on   finding   offsetting   savings. In

circumstances, I recognise this is bound to be exceptionally

Developments since the 1989 Autumn Statement



5. The plans we agreed last year provide the starting point for

this Surve^^^There are intense pressures. Revised economic

assumptions, notably higher inflation, will add  2*5 billion to

demand-led progBl^^s next year alone. Community charge benefit

will cost an mt^L  % billion a year, at this year&apos;s level of

charges. Policy c^^mments, agreed since the last Survey, total a

further  1-1*5 billion.



6. The expenditure ^^^jections in the Budget Red Book assumed

unchanged planning totals. But total public spending was marked up

sharply, for current and future years, to reflect the higher level

of spending for which local auti^^-ties are now budgeting. Although

tougher capping should reduSUy^ke scale of future overspending,

higher local authority expenditul^^S already limited our room

7.       E(LG)    has   now   decided   on   the of central government



support for local authority current expenditure in England for

1991-92. The settlement, together with vigorous use of the

Government&apos;s existing powers to cap charges, shouldeaake it possible

to limit the average charge to significantly b^J^jg400.

These   decisions,    including measures*to improve the perceived

irness of the community charge, will add some  2.2 billion to the

ic   expenditure planning total.    There will be further additions

cotland and Wales.    The increase in   AEF   next   year, compared

is year, is  3 billion for England alone.



.s settlement reflects the high priority which we are

obliged collectively to give to local government finance in the

second year in which the community charge will be levied in England

and Wales, ftfk as E(LG) has recognised, it has unavoidable

implications%A^^hat can be afforded for other programmes. If extra

support for lolBb^Lithorities is not offset by greater restraint on

central governm t^spending, it will have to be financed from

central governmentj^mtLon.



The Bids



10. My minute of 11 July to the Prime Minister summarised the bids

received from Departments. In addition, we must take account of

territorial block consequences,^tffe nationalised industries, and our

net contributions to the EC.



11.      The   bids   exceed,    by   a lar

last year.    This is very disappoint!

the   difficult   situation   given to

myself on April 19.

rgin, those tabled this time

view of   the   warning of

es by the Chancellor and



12. Running cost bids alone are double those submitted last year.

Subject only to confirmation of MOD&apos;S figures, they imply an

increase in spending on the Civil Service of no lej^. than 16 per

cent next year.



13. This   is   quite   unacceptable.    We must contain

costs as a proportion of the planning total.    I shall

colleagues   to   cut back their bids drastically, especial

92, and to find much higher offsetting efficiency savings

also be prepared to postpone non-urgent expenditure.

14.      In particular, I shall look to colleagues to absorb the knock-

on costs of past and current year  pay settlements and to re-examine

^efcheir   manpower   proposals.      Running costs are our chosen mechanism

controlling manpower numbers, but the bids imply a net increase

^KBlans of 7,000-13,000 Civil Service posts.



15  ^^pb major nationalised industries are looking for very large

incrOTses over their baselines. These bids will have to be

substantially reduced. Where large projects are involved, we must

take account of the longer term implications for future Surveys. It



is   a matt

corporate pl&apos;



Implications



continuing concern that financial management and

in some of these industries is inadequate.



16.      Given these &apos;.

They imply a substant:

any sustainable growth

taking   account   of the

Chancellor&apos;s paper.



face an exceptionally   difficult Survey,

al increase in spending, far outstripping

real   output.     This   remains   so, after

worse   inflation prospect described in the



17. We clearly cannot contemj^^^^dding to public spending on

anything remotely resembling thilDfc^^e. Market commentators would

conclude that we had abandoned our ^cfte-long policy of reducing

spending as a share of national   ^   They would immediately

recognise the very serious problems fK^^would pose for fiscal

policy. And they would undoubtedly qpes^ion the firmness of our

intention to defeat inflation. That woufrlause adverse market

reactions. Indeed, the AEF announcement may raise some of these

worries even before the Autumn Statement.



18.      The best reassurance we can offer is to rea

sticking   as close as possible to the planning tota

last White Paper, with the aim of maintaining the sha

spending    (excluding   privatisation   proceeds) to GDP

19. In present circumstances, both objectives will be extremely

demanding.      But   anything   less   will be seen as a weakening in our



;solve to maintain strict control of spending.      I   recognise that

programmes   are   feeling the effects of higher inflation. But

^planning is part of our armoury against inflation. That is why

^oduced it in 1981.    This year, above all, we must respect the

^cash planning.    We cannot afford to accommodate inflation.



20. I therefore ask all colleagues to review again their

priorities, with a view to selecting from their bids only those

which they ^^^ard as essential; and to look again at their

programmes 8?^^ P^1^ ^e offsetting savings which will be needed to

fund any sucM^y^reases. We certainly need to re-examine

rammes,    not just the five largest: social

ion,    defence   and   the Home Office, which



ramme spending.



I must warn that I shall need to secure much larger reductions

in   recent   Surveys,    to achieve an outcome consistent with an

Conclusions



22. Against the background of a more dJj^Tieu.t economic prospect,

we must give top priority to defeating i^TJ^tion, and maintaining

confidence in our policies. I therefore ask the Cabinet to agree

that:



(i)

(iii) the very substantial increase in Aggregate External Finance

for local authorities has severely constrained the room for

adding to other programmes;



iven the intense pressures on demand-led programmes,    on top

the   cost   of   existing   firm   commitments, bids for other

^programme expenditure   and   running   costs   will   need   to be

eliminated   or   very   sharply reduced, and any increases which

colleagues regard as essential should   be   offset   by savings
