GULF:     REINFORCEMENT OPTIONS



Following the United States decision to deploy additional

forces,  I have been considering whether we should reinforce our

forces in the area.    During his recent visit the US Secretary of

State, Mr Baker made specific requests: the expansion of our ground

force to an Armoured Division;  transport units to assist US forces;

and additional mine countermeasures vessels (MCMVs).



The Need for Reinforcements



2. At present Saddam Hussein shows no sign of willingness to

withdraw from Kuwait.    It is therefore not sufficient simply to have

forces in place, we must make absolutely clear our determination and

our ability to evict him by force if necessary.    Although there are

sufficient Allied forces in place to give confidence in their

ability to defend Saudi Arabia we should not underestimate the

problems of an offensive.    There are some 26 Iraqi divisions

totalling some 400,000 men in the Kuwait area which have been

developing elaborate defensive positions for some three months and

are continuing to do so.    (And Saddam Hussein has just claimed that

he is sending another 250,000 troops to the area).



3. What we therefore need to do is to reinforce the Allied forces

on the ground so that there is a genuine offensive force which is



SECRET UK EYES A  ? cm



1


SECRET UK BYES A  - CMO



manifestly capable of defeating the Iraqi Army and recapturing

Kuwait.    We must encourage the maximum number of other non-US forces

to be ready to participate in an offensive.    We cannot, however,

rely on them and must therefore assume that such an operation would

have to be mounted principally by UK/US forces.    Even when the

additional US divisions announced last week are operational in

January the ground force ratios would remain in Iraq&apos;s favour:



End Nov 1990 January 1991



Iraq     US/UK Iraq US/UK

Troops                              2.4:1 1.4:1

Tanks                               3.8:1 1.3:1

Artillery                       3.8:1 2.2:1



Despite Allied air superiority,  they demonstrate clearly the

need for additional armoured/mechanised forces of the sort

announced by President Bush and requested by Mr Baker.



Options for Increased UK Ground Forces



4.      There are three ways in which the UK ground force

contribution could be enhanced:



a. Strengthening 7 Armoured Brigade.    The fighting power

of 7 Armd Bde could be increased by including any or all of

an additional armoured,  artillery or engineer regiment and

a mechanised infantry battalion.



b. Additional Mechanised Brigade.    An additional

mechanised brigade would consist of one Challenger tank

regiment,  two mechanised infantry battalions,  one artillery



SECRET UK EYES A - CMO



2


SECRET UK EYES A  ? CMO



regiment and brigade troops.    Additional support

helicopters also be required.    The total number of

reinforcements would be just under 8500 troops (see Annex

A) .



c.      Formation of a UK Armoured Division.    Mr Baker&apos;s

request was for the formation of an Armoured Division

normally comprising 3 brigades and divisional troops

(artillery, aviation,  engineers,  logistics).    We could find

one but not two additional mechanised brigades (as

described in (b))  from our own resources, but we have

established that the US would be prepared to place one of

their brigades (with its own support elements) under UK

control in a composite division.    On this basis, the

formation of a Division would require some 5500 men (over

and above those in the additional Mechanised Brigade) to

provide the HQ and the UK divisional troops - see Annex  

and full divisional Order of Battle at Annex C.



5. Costs. Our broad estimate of additional costs for the

existing deployments for this financial year is  400M. The

estimated additional costs of the three options are as follows:



(a) Enhanced

Brigade



(b) Additional

Brigade

SECRET UK EYES A - CMO

SECRET UK EYES A    ? CMO



These estimates are the best available, but the margin for error

must be substantial.    They do not include any funding required to

procure extra ammunition needed for sustained operations.

Industry cannot meet these ammunition shortfalls in the time

available and we will therefore have to rely on loan/purchase

from another nation.    If we were required to replace these at

full market cost this would amount to some  10M in the case of a

brigade and up to  200M for a division (the bulk of this is for

the new Multiple Launch Rocket System for which the US is the

most likely source).    Once we have made our decision we should

increase the pressure on our WEU partners to contribute in cash

or kind  (in particular, we should press for help with 155 mm

ammunition).



6. Timetable.     Any offensive must be largely complete before

climate and the start of *Ramadan (17 March) make large scale

military action increasingly difficult.    Any reinforcements must

therefore be fully operational as early as possible in the New

Year.    For this reason, OD(G) agreed last week that certain

preparations should be set in hand to bring a brigade and

divisional elements to notice to move.    Present advice is that

this would mean that the division would begin to arrive in early

January and its elements would become progressively operational

with the division as a whole fully operational by the end of

Janua ry.



7. I have scrutinised each option thoroughly and am satisfied

that all the elements are essential to ensure that our troops are

properly equipped and supported to give them the best chances in

battle.    There is no doubt that the formation of a UK division

would provide the most effective ground fighting force and would

also make the most political impact.    Although a second



SECRET UK EYES A   ? CM0

4


SECRET UK  YES A  ? CMO



(mechanised) brigade would be significant militarily and

politically,  it would be less effective both because it would

lack  the additional combat power contributed by the divisional

troops and because the combat power and tactical employment of

two UK brigades would be maximised if they were formed into a UK

division.    This would also be the most economical effective

logistic arrangement.    Enhancing 7 Armoured Brigade would provide

a useful increase in its fighting power, this would be much less

significant than the other options in terms of overall Allied

st rength.



8.    We do,  however, need to consider carefully the implications,

particularly if deploying an additional brigade or a full

division.    Apart from cost,  the key considerations are:



(1) Both a second brigade and a full division would

probably be  ?one-shot?  options.    We would find it very

difficult to find sufficient rotational troops to maintain

these force levels in full for more than six months. Nor

would we be able to meet Mr Baker&apos;s request for transport

assistance with either of these options.



(2) All three options would further curtail BAOR&apos;s

operational capability.    For an additional brigade or a

division, BAOR would suffer a severe reduction in

operational viability.



(3) Although a second brigade or a full division would be

a considerably more effective fighting formation than an

enhanced 7 Armd Bde,  they would be more difficult to

sustain operationally.    There are problems with the

necessary equipment and logistic preparations to make a



SECRET UK EYES A   ? CM0



5


SECRET UK EYES A   - CMO



force of this size fully viable.    In particular, we would

only have sufficient engine spares to sustain the

Challenger tank force for a period of mobile operations of

about 20 days,  against 30 at present.    We could meet our

ammunition requirements only by drawing on the stocks of

allies.    Initial soundings have indicated a general

willingness to release stocks for our use.    On that basis,

I am satisfied that the procurement and logistic problems

are not insuperable.



(4) It would,  of course,  be necessary to increase medical

provision to correspond with an increase in combat troops.

Casualty rates are very difficult to predict but NATO

planning,  tempered by experience from the 1967 Arab/Israeli

War,  suggests we should plan on an additional 1000 beds to

cope with possible peak rate casualties from heavy combat

by a UK Division.    This would require closure of most

service hospitals both in UK and Germany which will in time

add to the pressure on the NHS.    I hope, however, that it

will be possible temporarily to withdraw to this country

some surgical staff who have set up the initial medical

facilities for 7 Armoured Brigade and return them to the

Gulf in January.



(5) An additional brigade or a division would require the

deployment of some 80 specialist reservists (principally

medical staff,  engineers,  artillery)  and perhaps up to 800

more to replace regulars deployed to the Gulf. Initially

we will call for volunteers from both the Regular Reserves

(ie individuals who have left the regular forces) and the

Volunteer Reserves.    If those are insufficient we will

call-up Regular Reserves selectively under Section 11 of



SECRET UK EYES A  - CMO



6


SECRET UK EYES      - CMO



the Reserve Forces Act 1980, although Parliament would have

to be notified.    I aim to avoid compulsory call-out of the

TA.    There may, however,  be a need to use a Royal Auxiliary

Air Force medical evacuation squadron which would be needed

on the outbreak of hostilities.    These cannot be called out

under Section 11 but initial legal advice is that it would

be possible to do so under the alternative Section 10, if

hostilities were imminent.    I should be grateful for the

Attorney General&apos;s advice on this point.



9. In summary,  the formation of a UK Armoured Division would

be  the single most effective military and political contribution

we could make to the Allied effort.    It would, however, have

severe implications for BAOR;    it would be less operationally

sustainable than a single Brigade; and we should not be able to

assist with the US transport needs.    Nevertheless, the military

priority is to provide the most substantial combat

reinforcement,  to offset the Iraqi numerical superiority. For

this  reason,  I believe that we should expand our ground

contribution to a division as outlined in paragraph 4c.



10. I must, however, warn of the cost implications.    I agreed a

cost-sharing arrangement with the Chief Secretary for the

present Gulf operations but the scale of this enlargement would

be  such that it could only be funded from the Reserve.



MCMVs



11. Mr Baker also specifically requested the deployment of

additional Mine-counter Measure Vessels  (MCMVs).    The US are

short of such vessels and if amphibious or naval gunfire



SECRET UK EYES A - CMO



7


SECRET UK EYES A   ? CMO



operations are planned (even as deception tasks)  it will be

necessary to ensure that the relevant sea area is clear of

mines.    Two additional MCMVs are currently being prepared for

despatch to the Gulf and could be there by mid-January.



Possible Additional Reinforcements



12.     I am also considering two other ways in which we might

reinforce our forces:



a. Offensive Air.    An increase in offensive air power

could itself add to the capability of the ground force.

This could be provided by deploying up to 24 further

Tornado GRls supported by additional tanker aircraft.

Until we know more about additional US air reinforcements

and about the practicalities of basing additional aircraft

in the area,  it is not possible to reach a firm decision.

We are taking some initial steps to prepare these aircraft,

without any commitment,  to allow them to be deployed

rapidly if needed.    I will report further on this in due

course.



b. CVS Group.    Although not mentioned by Mr Baker or

General Schwarzkopf,  the Americans have suggested that the

UK deploy a CVS Group (a carrier,  two escorts and two

auxiliaries)  to the Red Sea to take over coordination of

embargo operations there in order to release one of the US

large strike carriers so that its offensive air capability

can be turned to best effect.    I am at present not

persuaded of this case.    Maritime Operations is one area

where other Allies can make substantial contributions and



SECRET UK EYES A   ? cM0

8


SECRET UK EYES A   ? CMO



do more.    I am also mindful that, while we must be prepared

to pay our share of the cost of defeating this aggression,

it will be very expensive and if this is an area where

Allies can contribute they should be urged to do so.



These possibilities are outlined in more detail at Annex D.



CONCLUSION



13. I  recommend that we should proceed immediately with the

despatch of an additional mechanised brigade and other

reinforcements to form a UK Armoured Division.    We must

recognise, of course,  that our greater involvement will increase

the possible scale of loss&apos;es - both in men and materials. But

they will also reduce the chances of having to fight at all, and

reduce the likely casualties if we have to fight.    I would need

?.o discuss the cost to the Reserve with the Chief Secretary,

taking into account any assistance which we may be able to

obtain from our allies.    I invite colleagues to note that I am

considering the need for further reinforcements to our offensive

air capability and the possibility of sending a CVS Group to the

Red Sea.



14. I am sending copies of this minute to the members of OD,

the Health Secretary, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and

the Attorney-General,  and to the Cabinet Secretary.

ADDITIONAL MECHANISED BRIGADE



1. Organization.    Mechanised brigade consisting of Challenger

regiment, and two mechanised infantry battalions together with an

artillery regiment and brigade troops.



2. Logistic Support.    Further third line, or line of

communication, logistic support will be required to sustain the

brigade between the rear maintenance area and the brigade positions.



3. Divisional Support.    The brigade will be dependent on the

divisional formation into which it will be integrated for additional

combat support such as area Air Defence (normally provided by

Rapier),  general support artillery,  reconnaissance and anti tank

aviation support.



4. Movement.    Movement of the brigade to the Gulf by sea would

take in the order of 30-40 days which includes the time required to

collect shipping from trade, move to the port and load the shipping.

On arrival in theatre the formation will need to unload, move

forward,  shake out,  acclimatize for operations and conduct the

necessary battle procedures.    Total period reguired to become fully

operational is about 65 days.

ADDITIONAL REINFORCEMENT OPTIONS



Offensive Air



1. Tornado GRl.    Up to 24 additional Tornado GRl could be

deployed by the end of January 1991 as the best means of

increasing the RAF offensive strike capability in theatre.

There are, however,  considerable logistic and, particularly,

basing problems at present.    Additional weapon stocks would be

required and fuel resupply at Tabuk would require further

investigation.    In particular,  there is insufficient ramp space

available in either Saudi Arabia or Bahrain at present, although

this constraint would be likely to reduce at the district of

hostilities, especially once the threat of Iraqi air attack on

bases had been removed.    One option would therefore be to

prepare some or all of these aircraft to permit rapid deployment

at a later stage;  this might include forward basing,  for example

in Cyprus.



2. Supporting Air-to-Air refuelling.    The distance of

potential  targets from our main bases in Saudi Arabia requires

AAR to extend range/duration of our offensive and defensive

aircraft.    AAR tankers are required to provide some augmentation

of in theatre offensive and defensive air assets (and indeed,

aircraft arriving from out of theatre).    Two further VClOKs

could be deployed to bring the total to 9  (the complete VC10K

fleet);  8 Victors could also be deployed.    Basing options might

include Luxor in Egypt.



3. Naval Carrier Group (CVS).    The US Group in the Red Sea

(which is based on a large strike carrier)  is employed on

embargo enforcement, control of allied maritime navies, surface

surveillance and area air defence.    This prevents it from

realising its full potential as part of a US offensive force.

This is not an economical use of the force available and a small

UK Carrier Group would also be able to undertake these duties

and would thus be one way of releasing the US Group.    Work is in

hand on a possible operating concept for RN co-ordination of

embargo operations in the Red Sea,  taking into account the

rather different circumstances and problems from the Gulf. It

is also worth noting that the present US concept of operations

in the Red Sea appears to be rather different from that in the

Gulf area and has given rise to some problems.    There may be

other roles for which CVS Group would provide a valuable asset,

in terms of air defence or command and control, for example in

evacuation operations.
