undoubtedly the most important

performance would be to cut back



that there are strong reasons to aim for a

;than that in previous sessions. First,

te pressure for a lightening of the

stem^q.sed  the  background  to  this   in my

next session.   It will be the fourth

There is growing pressure for both Hi

in mid-July.   It is with these factors

considered the various bids and suppl

had from colleagues.



THE PROPOSED PROGRAMME



4. The programme at Annex A reflects the

work.    It consists of up to 23 Bills, 3 fewer

session.   On the whole, the reduction in the number

evenly  through  the various  categories,   and the

themselves are generally both less sizeable and less ca

those in the present session&apos;s programme.   Six of the Bills

than in the present session - are specifically in the

category.



5. The provisional programme is none the less a worthwhile 6h&lt;

it should be possible to develop a satisfactory theme for it



for a less heavy programme

of the present Parliament,

for the summer recess

that the Committee have

basis that, in addition to certain essential matters (the Anted Forces

and Northern Ireland) it tackles a number of quality of life issues 

le core of the programme would consist of Bills on criminal justice,

ygbways, road traffic, and town and country planning.    In addition

would be two Scottish Bills an the natural heritage and en

evidence and procedure.      None of the long or substantial

is wholly controversial in nature, but a number of the shorter

Ld be so,  such as those on privatisation of the British

Group (BIG) and an Student Unions.

legislate

Establishne



a number of uncertainties surround the programme. For

is meeting again to discuss the Student Union Bill. Hie

the production schedule for Trident may require us to

session to privatise the running of the Atomic Weapons

although QL was concerned about the political and

business management implications of doing so in the fourth session: we

shall review the position on this nearer the start of the session.

Urgent bids at nj^asent unforeseen may also arise: for example, the

legislative i^liratisDS of the construction of the Channel Tunnel rail

link have yet to D^Sskified. QL consider that the programme as a

whole is at the litofevjof what can be accommodated if our overall

objectives for a ligm^^apd less controversial session are to be met.

There is no rocm for ar^^z^tiens ^ ^  p^xp-g^ne unless offsetting

savings are made.



Is which QL decided not to include

C shows the fate of individual

of Bills not recornmended for

of attractive bids, and I

to the arguments which were



BILLS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR WQ CCN



7. At Annex   is a list of

in the recommended programme

Departments&apos; bids.    As usual,

inclusion in the programme con

particularly draw the Cabinet&apos;s a

put to QL in favour of the following



Charities Bill



8. This is a worthy measure which has weighty all-Party support. But

it would be a substantial and complex Bill, and against the other bids

they received, QL judged that it does not have a-sufficiently urgent

claim to a place in next session&apos;s programme. /A^pelieve, however,

that it would be a very suitable Bill for the fif^^^^ion and propose

therefore that it be given advance drafting authoriij



Registration Services Bill



9.    This too is a worthwhile and generally uncon

sizeable. Bill.   It is not critical that we legislate next

given the other pressures on the programme, QL decided

it a place.   They have provided, however, for a short Bill

the confidentiality of census information, which will be nece

session.

Jfaseums and Galleries Bill



0. This Bill has been waiting to secure a place in the programme

ice 1987. It would, among other things, give the Trustees of the

jonal, Tate and National Portrait Galleries corporate status,

aspects of the Bill are potentially controversial and QL

.y decided that it could not be found a place in next

Js programme. The Minister for the Arts has, however, indicated

a4^he)* 3uld be willing to consider simply a short Bill limited to the

corpqr^ti^status issue. The Canmittee therefore recommend that a Bill

an these^/iijies, which would enhance the quality of life theme of the

program^^^hculd be regarded as first reserve, to be brought forward

if a Bill)pre^fently in the programme drops out.



Agriculture^Deregulation) and Covent G^trten Mark-Pt AiTt-hority Bills

12. QL do not question th^^^ts of either of these Bills. The

Committee do not, however, fee /^Dis to justify including them in the

programme given their potentialS^H^aversiality and on top of the two

other agriculture Bills - on SeaV^^i^Conservation (Amendment) and on

Agriculture and Forestry (FinanciaJL?Prpv^ions) - which they propose to

accommodate in the programme.



Insurance Companies Bill



13. The Committee have proposed the iiiblusion in the programme of

Bills to permit privatisation of the Export Credit and Investment

Guarantees Department  (EOGD)   Insurance Services Group and (provided



that  a Bill  on computer misuse  is not

14.   QL concluded that it would not be possible to find a place for

this Bill alongside all the other bids received.     Hie Committee

ieved, however, that it would be sensible for the Department of

de and Industry to prepare instructions for a Bill, so that swift

on could be taken should real practical difficulties emerge from

shortcomings  of the present  law.      Should  legislation prove

le,  it would of course be open to the Trade and Industry

, to exchange the Insurance Companies Bill for one of the other

{JBJI^s for which he has secured places in the programme and to

whici^S^^ar, he has accorded greater priority.



Friendl^^siaieties Bill



15. This another area in which the existing law is defective and

the proposed Bill would not only remedy these short comings but increase

competition and extend choice. It would be uncontroversial and

suitable for introduction in the House of Lords.



16.   Ihe Bill

of instructions to Parliamentary Counsel on Bills to be included in the
