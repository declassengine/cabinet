The United Kingdom and the United States have both accepted inprinciple the need to rearm Japan to a limited extent.    This is because itis essential to the interests of the West to deny Japan&apos;s man-power and resources to the Communist world, and because the West has not the forces to achieve this result unless Japan takes an active part in her own defence.As regards the question whether any limitations should be put on japanese rearmament, my colleagues will remember that on 2nd January(C.M.(51) 1st Conclusions, Minute 4) they approved a memorandum by my predecessor and the Minister of Defence (C.P.(50) 318) which included thefollowing recommendations :-(a) that a separate Defence Pact between the United States and japan should be concluded, concurrently with the Peace Treaty(agreement on this principle had previously been reached among all the Commonwealth countries);.(b) that in pursuance of the need for a liberal Peace Treaty it wouldbe undesirable, if not impossible, to impose or to suggest that japan agree to detailed defence restrictions, so that it wouldnot be practicable to include restrictive clauses in the DefencePact;(c) that no firm military safeguard limiting Japan&apos;s capability foraggression in the future is practicable;(d) that the only means of achieving any restrictions are:-(i)   Japan&apos;s voluntary acceptance of the provision of certainforces and weapons (including submarines, naval craftlarger than frigates, and strategic bombing forces) by the&quot;Allies for her defence, and the restrictive influence of thecontinued presence of Allied forces in Japan;
(ii) to a limited extent by the exploitation of Japan&apos;s economicdependence on the Allies;(e)    that Japan could be expected to agree both on military andeconomic grounds to the forces and weapons referred to in(d) above being provided by the Allies.Subsequent Discussions3. These views were put forward on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in subsequent discussions with the United States and commonwealth governments, and have subsequently found general agreement.    TheGovernments of Australia and New Zealand were reluctant for some time toaccept the principle of japan s freedom to rearm on the above basis, but even they are now disposed to accept it, since their security requirements are being met by the United States guarantee implicit in the proposed PacificDefence Pact.4, The Indian Government have always felt strongly that the peace treaty should be a non-restrictive one and they have throughout shared theviews of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom on this particularpoint.The Draft Treaty5. Article 5(b) of the draft Treaty attached as Annex A to C.P.(51) 137is admittedly unusual in that it recognises that Japan may voluntarily enterinto a collective security arrangement or arrangements participated in byother Allied Powers.    Judging by the precedent of other Peace Treaties, itwould have been more normal to say nothing on this point at all, i. e. to leaveJapan completely free to rearm.   (Restrictions on armaments were includedin the Treaty of Versailles, and the Treaties of Peace with Italy and the satellites after the last war, but the practical or psychological effects ofthe restrictive clauses have not been happy in any of these cases.)    TheUnited States Government wanted this passage included in the draft Treaty inorder to serve as a hinge on which to hang the separate Defence Pact, which,as made clear in paragraph 2 above, is in fact the only possible means of putting any restriction on Japan&apos;s power to rearm.H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1,28TH MAY, 1951.
