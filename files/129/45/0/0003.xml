-m     55   /SIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJ ST-Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (51) 78 COPY NO.   Vl20TH MARCH, 1951CABINETJAPANESE PEACE TREATYCHINESE PARTICIPATION AND DISPOSAL, OF FORMOSAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs.    CHINESE PARTICIPATIONViews of Kis Majesty&apos;s GovernmentOn 2nd January the Cabinet approved a paper containing thefollowing recommendation:     &quot;It is desirable that at an appropriate stage,before the formal peace conference is called, an invitation to take partin the Peace Treaty negotiations should be extended to the Central People&apos;sGovernment of China.   An approach in this sense to the United StatesGovernment at present would be inopportune, but the importance of doing so in the future should be borne in mind. &quot;  (CM. (51) 1st Conclusions,Minute 4).Views of United States Government2. In discussion with Sir A. Gascoigne in Tokyo on 29th January,Mr. Dulles said that it would be difficult for the United States Governmentto exclude Nationalist China as a signatory, and equally difficult for theUnited Kingdom Government to be a co-signatory with Nationalist Chinato the exclusion of the Communist regime;  Mr. Dulles added that he wasthinking on the lines of getting over these obstacles by means of a seriesof identical bilateral agreements with Japan rather than by a multilateralTreaty.   On his return to Washington after his tour, he again raised thesubject in conversation with H. M. Ambassador and simply said that hewould much welcome any suggestion which we might wish to make.The present situation. In view of this invitation from Mr. Dulles, and of the present tempoof the Peace Treaty discussions, (we informed the United States Governmentofficially of our views about the substance of the Treaty on 12th March and hope to let them have an unofficial working draft this month) I suggestthat a decision on our approach to the United States Government aboutChinese participation is needed now, in order to enable us to get our views in before the United States Government make up their minds.4. Since the Cabinet decision referred to in paragraph 1 was taken,the situation has changed in that the United Nations General Assembly have declared the Central Peopled Government an aggressor in Korea.   It isfor consideration whether this development calls for any modification ofthe Cabinefs decision.   On the whole, in present circumstances, Iconsider that it does not.   The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government inregard to the Korean hostilities is based on the conception of leaving the
door open for a negotiated settlement with the Central People&apos;s Govern-ment.   It would be consistent with that policy for us to record our viewthat the Central People&apos;s Government should participate in thenegotiations for a Japanese Peace Settlement.   The point is that Chinaas a State&apos; ought to participate and it is the Central People&apos;s Govern-ment which in fact represents China.   H. M. Embassy at &quot;Washington, whohave been consulted, have not suggested that our approach to the UnitedStates Government should be modified in view of recent developments.In view of these considerations, I recommend that, provided the general development of the Far Eastern situation in the immediate future permits,appropriate representations should be made as soon as possible.Suggested action5. It is however clear, both on general grounds and from specificwarnings by H. M. Embassy at Washington, that there is no likelihoodwhatever of the United States Government agreeing with our view on thispoint.   We should have no illusions on that score.   After we have gone on record with the United States Government in favour of an invitation to theCentral People&apos;s Government, the practical problem will still remainof what to do next.   We must accordingly look ahead, past the expectedUnited States refusal, and try to think out a constructive compromise solution which we could put to the United States Government simultaneously with the rest of our approach on Chinese participation, in order if we can toprevent them from going ahead on their own with Mr. Dulles&apos; idea ofidentical bilateral treaties or some other unpalatable solution.o. If the United States Government cannot agree to sign a treatytogether with the Chinese Communists, nor can we agree to sign onetogether with the Nationalists.   The solution accordingly may be some-thing on the following lines.   We should aim at a multilateral treaty,but, given the dispute between the other signatories about the &quot;two Chinas&quot;,we should agree that neither &quot;China&quot; should sign the Treaty with the restof us, but that, having regard to the desirability of awaiting a more general measure of agreement on disputed questions in the Far East,provision should be made in an accession clause for &quot;China&quot; to accedeonce unanimity had been achieved among the other signatories on the recognition problem (or some other formula with a similar suspensoryeffect).   We could not agree to the Chinese Nationalists being allowed to sign the Treaty.   Apart from other considerations, this would allow theJapanese to claim, at a later date, that we had prejudiced their relationswith the mainland of China by allowing the Chinese Nationalists to take partin the Peace Settlement at a time when the Japanese themselves were in noposition to express their own view.   If, however, a.fter the signature of thePeace Treaty, and quite apart from the arrangements provided for in itsaccession clause, the Japanese themselves wished to conclude a bilateral agreement with one &quot;China&quot; or the other, that would be their affair andtheir responsibility.7. This is clearly not an ideal compromise from our point of view, andeven so it may prove most difficult to persuade the Americans to accept it.One argument which they will probably make play with is the fact thatthe Chinese Nationalists still represent China on the Far Eastern Corn-mission.   If necessary, we could counter this by maintaining that the far eastern Commission, as an entity, should be regarded as having nothing todo with the task of preparing a Peace Treaty.   Our interpretation of theCommission^ terms of reference bears this out, and also the Commissiondoes not include Ceylon and Indonesia,, both Powers which were very much
concerned with the war against Japan.   We should hope on these lines to be able, in the context of the Peace Treaty, to minimise theimportance of the fact that Nationalist China is on the Far eastern commission.II.    DISPOSAL, OF FORMOSA8. While the question of Chinese participation in the Treaty is one ofprocedure, the problem of Formosa relates to the text of the Treaty itself.In view of the strong political connection between the two questions,hov/ever, it is appropriate that they should both be considered together.By way of a background I have annexed the extracts from the CairoDeclaration and the Potsdam Proclamation relating to the disposal of formosa and the Pescadores Islands.   (For purposes of this paper i will use the term &quot;Formosa&quot; to include the Pescadores Islands.)Views of His Majesty&apos;s Government9. In January, 1951, the Cabinet agreed that the decision of theUnited Nations or any other agreed decision on the future status of formosa and the Pescadores Islands should, if possible, be incorporated in the Treaty (CP. (50) 323, paragraph 8(b)(iv);  CM. (51) 1st Con-clusions, Minute 4).Views of United States Government10.        Mr. Dulles told Sir A. Gascoigne on 29th January that the UnitedStates Government had done a lot of thinking on this subject, but had found nothing moie constructive at present than to require Japan to acceptthe present situation, and they were hard put to it to define what thatwas with exactitude.   Mr. Dulles said that he would be extremelyresponsive to any suggestion from His Majesty&apos;s Government as to how tocontrol this delicate and difficult question.   We all agreed, he said, that japan should renounce her own right, title and interest to Formosa, buthow to go beyond that was obscure to him.Possible courses of action11.        It appears that there are three possible courses in regard toFormosa:-(a) For Japan to renounce her sovereignty and cede Formosa to&apos;China&quot; without specifying further what this means.   This has the advantageof being in accordance with the Cairo Declaration and the PotsdamProclamation, but might be difficult to defend against charges that it is an over^-facile way of shelving the problem without making any attempt to adjustit to present conditions.   It would, however, be technically quite possiblesince it would follow that whatever Government was the true Governmentof China was entitled to administer Formosa.(b) As a variation of (a), Japan could renounce her sovereignty andcede Formosa to &quot;China&quot;, but with a rider, not necessarily in the text ofthe Treaty, but perhaps in some accompanying document or public declaratioto the effect that, the signatories not being agreed on the interpretation of&quot;China&quot;, and having regard to the desirability of awaiting a more generalmeasure of agreement on disputed questions in the Far East, this clausedid not prejudice the question of what Chinese authority was entitled toexercise sovereignty over Formosa, as to which the signatories reservedtheir respective positions and liberty of action.   This formula could be linked up with that used on Chinese accession (paragraph 6 above).
(c)  Japan could renounce her sovereignty without specificallyceding Formosa to China or to any other Power.   This appears to be what mr. Dulles has in mind, but it would be open to the objections, first, ofnot being in accordance with the Cairo Declaration or the PotsdamProclamation, and secondly, of allowing Formosa to become a res nulliusuntil its future sovereignty could be established.12.        On the whole, I prefer solution (b).   The fact is that the Formosanissue looks like bedevilling the Far Eastern policies of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the United States Government for as far ahead as can before seen.   We cannot be expected to find a formula in the Treaty which willconjure this situation away.   What is needed is something which corres-ponds to the facts, is consistent with the Cairo Declaration and the potsdam Proclamation, but shelves the issue and leaves the hands of the signatories as free as possible to meet any eventual changes in the generalFar Eastern situation.III.    RE C OMME ND A T IONS13.   (a) That as regards Chinese participation we should as soon aspossible formally record our view with the United States Governmentthat the Central People&apos;s Government should be invited to participate inthe Treaty negotiations, and add unofficially that in the probable event ofChina refusing we would suggest the compromise solution of a multi-lateral treaty to be signed by neither &quot;China&quot; but with an accession clausefor the later accession of &quot;China&quot; in certain specified circumstances,which would be related to the desirability of a general Far Easternsettlement.(b) That as regards Formosa we should suggest to the United StatesGovernment unofficially that Japan should renounce her sovereigntyand cede Formosa to China, with an explanatory rider also referring to thedesirability of a general settlement in the Far East and reserving mean-while the respective positions of the signatories on the interpretation ofthis provision.(c) That in view of the inter-relation of the two problems, the approaches referred to in (a) and (b) above should be made simultaneously.H.M.Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,20TH MARCH, 1951.
