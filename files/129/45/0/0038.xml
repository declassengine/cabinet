NOTE BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUERY

I circulate herewith a note on the more important statistics relating to the economic situation which have become available since the last Economic Report (C.P.-(51) 54).

ECONOMIC REPORT

I.-Man-Power

During the first two months of this year the working population increased by 36,000, and there was a fall of 40,000 in the numbers unemployed, making an addition of 76,000 to the occupied population. The strength of the Armed Forces increased by 41,000 and the number in civil employment by 35,000.

2. There were 29,000 more in metals, engineering and vehicles industries (which have expanded by 117,000 since June last year) and 12,000 more in coal-mining. Employment in distribution declined seasonally by 17,000.

3. The number of persons registered as unemployed in Great Britain declined from 333,600 at 15th January to 274,900 at 12th March. This fall was greater than the usual seasonal decline over this part of the year.

4. The employment and unemployment figures are being watched closely for signs of shortages of workers to carry out defence orders and for possible unemployment and short-time working through loss of production due to shortages of raw materials. The high demand for labour led not only to a fall in unemployment, but also to some difficulties in meeting demands for skilled workers in engineering and in other industries. Here and there shortages of raw materials have occasioned some, but as yet very little, unemployment and short-time working.

5. Unemployment in Development Areas has fallen. At 15th January there were 122,400 persons registered as unemployed in these Areas, and at 12th March the number was 105,000. At 13th March, 1950, the figure was 138,900. Over the past year the rate of improvement has been rather greater in the South Wales and the Merseyside Areas than in the other two large Areas-North-Eastern and Scottish.

II.-Production

6. The index of industrial production (1946=100) was 141 in January 1951 compared with 141 in December 1950 and 135 in January 1950. On the basis of the information so far received, the index for February 1951 is expected to be l46-147 against 140 in February 1950. The rate of increase for the first two months

of the year, compared with the corresponding period pfj last year, was about 5 percent., but it is too early to set this against the forecast of a 4 per cent, increase for theyear 1951 given in the Economic Survey.7. There were two factors which curtailed output in January and Februarythis year. The, severe weather in the first weeks Of 1951 reduced building workand, secondly, ihere *h&apos;as been-mot-3&apos;sicknesS; among workers. The figures of theMinistry of National Insurance show that the total number of insured personsabsent from work owing to sickness was 1 -4 million on 16th January, 1951-nearly50 per cent, higher than a year ago.Coal,8. In the first 15 weeks of this year the output of deep-mined coal was62-7 million tons against 59-9 million tons in the first 15 weeks of 1950. Bothperiods include the Easter holidays.9. Deliveries of opencast coal in the first 15 weeks of 1951 were 2-76 million tons against 3-40 million tons a year ago. Output this year has been particularly affected by bad weather conditions.10.  Arrivals of imported coal to 7th April this year total 812,400 tons.11. The number of Wage-earners on the colliery books recovered from 688,000to 702,000 irv the first quarter of the year and is now back again to the total thatit was a year ago. Absenteeism, particularly voluntary absenteeism,, has been some-what higher than last year, but output per man shift is still increasing and was higher than in the first quarter of 1950.12. In order to meet the increased demand for coal at home, exports andbunkers have been reduced and were 3-0 million tons leSs than.in the first threemonths of last year; inland consumption of coal Was 1-5 million tons higher.Increased output and the restrictions on exports have reduced the drain on stocks,but at the beginning of April distributed stocks were still about 800,000 tons lessthan at the same time last year. ^;Steel       &apos;&quot;   7&apos; - or:      \13. The rate of output of steel ingots and castings so far this year has been about the same as, or slightly lower than, in the first quarter of 1950; total output for the first three months was lower because the Easter holidays occurred in Marchfhis*year. Stocks of pig iron and scraphave been falling steadily and, as sufficient supplies of steels-making materials may be difficult to: obtain,, output for the year1951 is expected tb be below the 16-3 million tons produced in. 1950.14. The output of pig iron in the first quarter of 1951 was 184,400 tons aweek-about the same rate as that in the first quarter of 1950.Textiles15. Output of cotton, spun rayon and mixture yarns in January was slightly lower than in January 1950 largely owing to a fall in the number of operatives atwork. There was, however, a considerable improvement in February and output in the three weeks before Easter was at a rate nearly 6 per cent, above the corres-ponding period last year.16. Output of rayon yarn arid staple fibre was.28-5 million lb. in Februaryagainst 31 -9 million lb. in January and 28-5 million lb. a year ago. The fall inFebruary was partly, due tofewer workingi days, but the future level of output isvery, dependent on securing supplies of sulphur.-:&apos;&apos;-T7. Raw wool consumption in January; 1951 at 43 million lb. was 3 million lb.less thariin January 1950^a continuation-of the decline which began in theauturiin.This reduction was ioffset by greater use of shoddy and other substitute materials,so that output of woven wool fabrics was atabouti the /same, rate as in the-previous year.; tnEunpX dill )h  JtisH&amp;pM !n*mooi^&apos;0 ^ V&quot;-*&quot;7f G&quot;. ^ ,SJ&apos;! 1U *&quot;Motor-Vehicles ,18. Production of passenger cars. and ichatssis averaged 10,198 a week inJanuary jarid; Februaryg Of Which 7,543 were for export;.the weekly average, pro-ducti6riciri&apos; the corresponding period last&apos; year was 10,044; of which 8,060 were forexport. The decline in the numbers for export may be partly due to lack of shipping space. In the two months, an average of only 7,200 vehicles a week was actuallyshipped for export: 7* .id- \&apos;19:; -Productidrivdf commercial vehicles inr January^ ?^nd February - averaged5,563 a Week against 4,997 a week,in the- same period last year. Production forekportsofar this year has averaged 3,691 aweekagainst5,156:a week a year a.go;
Deliveries of commercial vehicles for the Armed Forces are increasing; in the first two months pf 1951, 646 were supplied, compared with 1,663. in the whole year 1,950.Merchant Shipbuilding &quot; &apos;&apos;- &quot;    r-&apos;: -f&apos;v-20. The amount of merchant shipbuilding work done in the first three monthsof 1951 was about the same as. in the corresponding months of last year^ alt^dughcompletions were less. The tonnage of merchant ships completed in the first threemonths pf this year was 286,000 gross tons compared with 344,000 gross tons in thesame period a year ago.       ::&apos; &apos;&apos;     &apos;f&apos; ]\,:p:^f&apos;[,^r i^^^^H!&apos;&apos;^&apos;!!^^!^^^&apos;!21.   The tonnage of merchant snipping under 96^March was 1,880,000 tons. The tonnage(hivessels undergoing repair and conyiersionwas 2,119,000 tons at the end of December and rose to 2,417,000 tons at the endof March.Building22. The number of permanent houses completed in Great Britain during january was 13,150, Compared with 15,950 in December and 14,356 in January 1950.Unusually bad weather conditions, and the influenza epidemic accounted for thefall in output. There was a slight improvement in February when 13,984permanent nouses were completed against. 14,069 a year ago.23. Increased output of building bricks, together with the reduced level ofbuilding activity, caused stocks of building bricks to increase from 166 million atthe end of 1950 to 207 million at the end of February;. in February 1950 stocks were186 million.Ill-Stocks24. The index of the volume of stocks of food and feeding-stuffs, raw materials,tobacco and petroleum products (December 1949 ^ 100) has fallen from 98 inJanuary 1950 to 86 in December 1950 and 83 in January 1951. This index does not cover Government-held stocks under the stockpiling programme.Stocks.

Although the relatively high level of imports of certain raw materialsduring January resulted in an increase in the stocks of textile materials, wOodpulpand fertilisers, there was a continued decline in the stocks of steel-making materials,non-ferrous metals (allowing for the transfer of a certain quantity of tin to the strategic stockpile), rubber and timber.26. The effect of the shortages pf raw materials on the level of industrial pro-duction so far has been most marked in the case of sulphuric acid production andnewsprint consumption.27. Production of sulphuric acid remained at a very high level throughout1950, averaging 150,000 tons a months. In January 1951 production fell to 136,000tons and in February to 119,000 tons. Stocks of sulphur (for acid) at the end ofJanuary were 64 - 9 thousand tons against 71 r 6 thousand tons a year earlier.28. Despite the reduction in the consumption of newsprint imposed from Julylast year, stocks of newsprint are tending to fall and, apart from a short period in1948, stocks at the end of January this year at 96,000 tons were the lowest since theend of the war.IV. Internal Financial Situation29. The most striking feature of the current situation is the,continued rapidrise in import prices. With the prospect of a continuing high level of United Statesdemand in general, and for commodities in particular, this,trend must.be a causeof grave anxiety. Recent wage advances give^tise to some fear of an.increase,though less serious,, in internal costs. The trend of employment, and uneniploymentshows a high demand for labour, concentrated particularly in certain&quot; areas and40404 b all		Raw	Petroleumstocks	Food	, materials	products(a)			98	) 97	98	9993	93	91	10392	93	91	10788	82	89	10186	79	85	10383	74	83	101

Orders on Hand-New orders are still being placed on the engineering industry at a rate considerably in excess of current output. Aircraft contracts placedin. February were well above the 1950 average. Heavy pressure on steel-makers&apos;order books continued; measures to deal with the general steel supply situation haverecently been before the Production Committee and are now being worked out indetail. Non-ferrous metal supplies continue to cause anxiety.33. Import prices-The rise in import prices continued during the first twomonths if the year and the index was, 125 (1950=100) in February. This is anincrease of 10 per cent, since December. Raw material prices have risen 20 per cent,since December.34. Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices have also continued to rise. TheBoard of Trade Index (1938 - 100) was 309 in March, an increase of about 7 percent, since December.. The continued rise in prices of industrial materials and manu-factures was offset to some extent by a slight fall in certain food prices.35. Retail prices-The Interim Index of Retail Prices (June 1947 = 100) rose from 116 in December to 118 in February. Prices of food^ clothing, fuel and house-hold goods all rose during the two months. A further rise in the index must beexpected as a result of the decisions to raise food prices and there will be a furtherrise in prices of clothing and household goods.36. Export prices. Export prices advanced from 106 to 109 (1950 = 100)between December and February, a rise of 3 per cent.37. Wage rates and earnings-The index of wage rates (June 1947 = 100)rose by: one point in each of the months January, February and March and now stands at 117. In the last six months the index has risen seven points; the previousincrease of seven points was spread over the twenty-one months December 1947 to september 1950.38. During January and February increases in weekly wages amounting toover  1 million to 4 million people became effective;39. The results of the Ministry,of Labour earnings enquiry for October 1950are now available, and they show that earnings during 1950 were rising somewhatfaster than wage rates.. This was due to a number of factors including a rise inthe number of hours worked per week.Earnings and hours worked in manufacturing^)Men (aged 21 and over)Weekly earningsPer cent,increaseover1938HoursworkedHourlyearningsWomen (aged 18 and over)Weekly earnings&quot;Per cent,increaseover1938HoursworkedHourly,8^1938 October1948 October1949 April...October1950 April...October..s. d.69 0137 11139 11142 8145 9150   5100103107111.118,-47-746-746-646-847-0.47-6pence&apos;17-435-436-036-6*37-2.37-9s.  d:32;   6.747778808212913714214815443-54.1-641-841-741-942-0pence9-021-22-22-23-23-0) The figures represent the average, earnings, including&apos;..-&apos; bonus,. overtime,&apos; &amp;c, and beforededuction of income; tax. or insurance contributions, in one week in the months indicated.

Retail salesi fell seasonally in January butTpseagain inyFefct^uary.Total sales of large-scale retailers were 11 ppj; cent: higher by value in January and16 per cent, higher in Febfria&apos;ry&apos;;;^ of 1950;while retail apparel, stocks are &apos; now slightly; Tower than /they! .Sv,ere a. year ago&apos;.. The largest increase was in sales of household.ggods.,&apos; There was^lso a considerable increase compared with a year ago in man^rh^ms of the .trade&apos;of ind^retailers in the first two months of the year (    &apos;,l^mAl. ^Stocks of large-scale^ retailers: at the&apos; end, of; February were.:only: a littlelarger, than a year ago: stocks of nonrfood goods: in January and February were5 per cent, and 4 per/cent, higher by value, respectively; than in theisame months of1950; while retail apparel stocks are now slightly lower than they were a year ago? ;42. Money and credit. Bank loans increased in February to a level about per cent: higher than&apos;in February 1950. Advances; to customers by the LondonClearing Banks stood at  1,754 million at 21st March, an increase of  51 million over the previous month and  160 million over March-1950. The total money at call, bills discounted, Treasury Deposit Receipts and investments (roughly repre-senting direct and indirect bank accommodation to the Government),at  3,636million in March compared with  3,587 million in March 1950.43. Bank deposits fell seasonally during the first&apos;quarter of the year from 6,368 million in December to  6,037 millipniri March-or 4 per cent, higher thanthe previous March. &apos; ,      .&apos;&apos;, /.44. After a slight check in December the Actuaries Index of ordinary sharesprices (1938 = 100) rose to 145 1 in January and 150-2 in February, but fell to 143 - 7in March. Gilt-edged prices have continued a fall which began in October. Theprice of 2  per cent. Consols averaged 68 1 in March, the lowest level for a longtime. The rate Of interest has therefore continued to rise, the yield on Consolshaving increased from 3 - 52 in December to 3 - 67 in March.V. -External Financial SituationExternal Trade45. United Kingdom imports were valued at the record figure of  303:4 million in March, making a total for the first quartertof the year of  849-1 million.This was 22 per cent, above the fourth quarter-of 1950 and 40 per cent, above thefirst quarter of 1950.46. Exports in March were valued provisionally at  190- 5 million. The total for the first quarter was  580 - 3 million; this was 4 per cent, below the fourthquarter but 12 per cent, above the first quarter of 1950. .     v        \47. Re-exports in March were valued at  17 T million arid for the first quarter at  33-5 million.. The excess of imports (valued c.i.f.) over exports aridre-exports (valued f.o.b.) in the first quarter of 1951 was therefore  235-3 mijlibriagainst a quarterly average of  87-0 million in 1950.      :,&apos;&quot;&apos;:&quot; .&apos;&apos;:&apos;,48.

Balance of Payments &apos;    ri    &apos;  \  &apos;\     p. &apos; &apos;h- 49., Gold and dollar, position. As announced in the Mouse of Commons, on 5th April, the sterling area gold and dollar surplus in the first quarter of this yearamounted to $360 million Compared with $398 million in the last quarter of 1950,arid the gold and dollar reserves increased over the quarter by $458 million, bringing them up to $3,758 million on 31st March. Very high earnings by countries in theRest of the Sterling Area, particularly from sales, of wool, cocoa, tin and rubber,are mainly responsible for this good result. In addition^ we received $76 million during the quarter in settlements With the European Payments Union for the UnitedKingdom (and Sterling Area) surplus with the Union. The gold and dollar surpluswas achieved in f ace of a decline iri sterling balances on North American accounts of almost $100 million, a movement that almost entirely reversed the build-up ofbalances during the previous quarter. The drawings on the balances have in themain been used to finance current American purchases; there is no suggestion of arepatriation Of funds.50. Early indications suggest that a fall iri the rate of sufplUs (Which may prove substantial) is likely in the near future. United Kingdom dollar expenditureon imports is increasing, though fairly slowly; a seasonal decline in the Rest of sterling Area dollar earnings, particularly from wool and CoCOa^ is to be expected;pur surplus with the European Payments Union was very much reduced in March,involving a big decline in our probable dollar receipts, and though the future trendis uncertain, total dollar settlements this quarter are likely to show a big declineon last quarters figure; finally, we must expect a steady increase in dollar spendingby Rest of Sterling Area countries, signs of Which are accumulating,51. Sterling liabilities. Alongside the increase in our gold and dollar reserves,sterling liabilities have been rising rapidly. The increase is confined entirely to sterling area countries, Which have added  174 million in their holdings during january-February. NOn-sterlihg area balances continue to fall slowly (by 44 million during the same period) reflecting the continued strength of the positionof the sterling area as a whole vis-a-vis the non-sterling area.52. United Kingdom General Balance of Payments. The Balance of Pay-ments White Paper (Cmd. 8201) shows a United Kingdom surplus on current account of  229 million in 1950 as a whole and of  183 million in the second half-year alone. Recent trade trends suggest that, primarily as a result of increasingimport prices, and a check to the expansion in the volume Of United Kihgdomexports, this surplus had probably entirely disappeared during the first quarter of1951. This is of course, consistent with our expectations for the Whole of 1951 as outlined in the Economic Survey.European Payments Union53. The United Kingdom net surplus with the European Payments Union inFebruary 1951 Was  33-6 million and in March  5-3 million, making the total united Kingdom net surplus  226-6 million for the period July 1950 to March 1951.After Writing off  53-6 million against conditional aid and the use of  30-6 htiilionof sterling balances by other countries to meet deficits with the Union, the UnitedKingdom has received  33&apos;4 million in dollars and is in Credit With the european payments Union to the extent of  109-1 million.54. Germany has almost exhausted the special credit granted to her by theEuropean Payments Union but her balance of payments position improved sub-stantially in March and she had a surplus of $10 million with the European Pay-ments Union. At their meeting on 6th April, 1951, the Council of O.E.E.C. con-sidered Germany&apos;s position and made recommendations on remedial action to betaken by Germany and other O.E.E.C. countries to alleviate Germany&apos;s difficulties;arrangements were also made td keep the position under review in future.Austria and Greece are running into extreme debtor positions with the european payments Union and Portugal an extreme creditor position; the Managing board are considering how these shall be dealt with.
