k-HS-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIALo ACP.(51) 112 COPY NO. OX17TH APRIL, 1951CABINETBORROWING POWERS OF THE NATIONAL COAL board memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power under Section 26 of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act, 1946,the Minister of Fuel and Power is empowered to make advances to theNational Coal Board for capital purposes up to an aggregate of  150millions within a period of five years from the passing of the Act (i. e. up to12th July, 1951) and in subsequent periods to advance such amount as parliament may determine.    It is necessary to introduce legislationurgently to extend these powers beyond July, 1951, and I propose that the monetary limit should be raised to  300millions and the time limitremoved.2. A limit of  300 millions would enable the Board to finance their long term plans for reorganising and developing the industry as publishedlast year in their &quot;National Plan for Coal&quot;.    Under this Plan capitalexpenditure over the next fifteen years is estimated to amount to  635millions, of which a substantial proportion will be found from the internalresources of the industry.3. This proposal was accepted by the Socialisation of industries committee (S.I.(M)(51) 4th Meeting, Minute 3), but the legislation committee on 16th April (H.P.C.(51) 13th Meeting, Minute 3) thought itmight be politically unwise to ask Parliament to increase the Board1 sborrowing powers at the&apos;present juncture and requested me to considerthe possibility of retaining the present limit of  150 millions but withouttime limit.4. Against the existing limit of  150 millions the Board has received 41 millions only;  circumstances combined during the past five years tokeep the Board&apos;s calls on the Exchequer to a minimum.    But for thefuture, demands are expected to expand, and it is estimated that at 19i9price levels the outstanding balance of  109 millions would not last morethan five years.    Although the existing powers would, with removal of thetime limit, suffice for the time being, I am of the opinion that it is logicalto relate new borrowing powers to the programme in the Board&apos;s national plan.    Moreover to disregard this Plan at a moment when it is under dis-cussion between the Board and the mineworkers, preparatory to formal,submission to me, may well give the impression that the Government havepre-judged the issue and are not determined to press forward with the fullreorganisation and development of the coal industry.    The effects uponthe mineworkers themselves are likely to be very serious.   On the otherhand I appreciate that a substantial extension of investment limits at thepresent juncture may be controversial, and indeed I should record that,although the Treasury had no objection to my proposed  300 millions
limit on financial grounds, they did, throughout the discussions at official level, express doubts as to the political wisdom of extending the existinglimit in the new Bill,5. I do not, however, believe that the Opposition can make any validcase against my proposal.    The National Coal Board&apos;s National Plan isfounded upon the comprehensive scheme of reorganisation recommended in the Reid Report, which Opposition speakers never venture to challenge;Sir Charles Reid has himself, since his resignation, spoken and written ofcapital investment on this scale; the money will only be taken by theBoard, as it is required, and can be used;  and as it is taken, it willprogressively give us a big return in coal, which we urgently require.Since a limit of  700 millions was set for the British Electricity authority in the Electricity Act,  300 millions is really a modest figure for theNational Coal Board,J - &apos;6, After careful consideration I still feel that the balance ofadvantage lies with my original proposal, and I therefore ask the Cabinetto authorise me to include in the Coal Industry Bill a provision to increasethe Board&apos;s borrowing powers for capital purposes to  300 millions.7. The new Bill will also increase the temporary borrowing powersof the Board from  10millions to  20 millions; this has been agreed withthe Treasury and accepted by the Legislation Committee.P.J.N.-B.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W.1,17TH APRIL, 1951.
