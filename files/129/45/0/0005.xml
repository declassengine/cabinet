(THIS DOCUMENT- IS THE PROPERTY OF-H-IS BRITANNIC-MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)S E C R E TC.P.(51) 80 COPY NO. 16TH MARCH, 1951    .CABINETANNUAL REVIEW UNDER PART I OF the agriculture ACT, 1947Memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExahequerI have been asked by the other Ministers concerned to report onthe progress of discussion with the Farming Unions and on the position now reached.Course of the Negotiations2. The various proposals were outlined in E.P.C.(51) 17.    Therehave been some slight changes in the figures but basically the position is this.    In 1950/51 farm incomes adjusted to normal weather conditions are estimated at  299^ millions.    If costs, prices and production levelsremained constant so that this income was repeated in 1951/52, they wouldbe  26^ millions in excess of the target income proposed for 1951/52.Increase in costs is. put at  871&quot; millions of which  34 millions have beencarried in 1950/51 notwithstanding the high level of income.    Towards theremaining increase in costs of  53j millions there will thus be an excessof income at present prices of  26^ millions and after allowing for variousadjustments the recoupment needed by the farmers is  37 millions.   the agriculture Ministers point out that, on the basis of these figures, whichthe Farmers1 Unions contend should not be the sole criterion for determination-ing price increases (see paragraph 6(a)) the final result would be that, ifthe farmers reach the target income of  273 millions proposed, they would suffer a net reduction of income of  26^ millions as compared with what itis estimated they will receive in 1950/51.    The figures are given in AnnexA.    Our original offer to the farmers was  35 millions before allowing for any withdrawal of the capital injection (see paragraph 3) and disregard-ing a special payment of  5^ millions in respect of the Special Price Review(see paragraph 4).    We proposed in the first place to withdraw  20 millions of capital making our net offer to the farmers  15 millions, but we laterreduced this capital withdrawal to  10 millions making our net offer  25millions.    All this was done under the authority given by the economic policy Committee at their 4th Meeting (E.P.C.(51) 4th Meeting, Minute 1).to the Agriculture Ministers, the Minister of Food and myself.3. Capital Injection.    In 1946/47 when the agricultural expansion programme was started we added  40 millions to the farm prices by wayof a temporary injection to provide some of the capital needed for theexpansion programme.    Our intention has been to let them have this injec-tion for five years (i. e.  200 millions in all) but we have never had any firm arrangement with the farmers about withdrawal.    We are clear thatit must be withdrawn gradually and that we should make a start this year.We have, however, reached the conclusion that if the farmers are to have 200 millions in all we ought not to withdraw more than  10millions thisyear.
4. Special Price Review.    Following on the wage increases last autumn the farmers asked for a Special Price Review.    At that time weundertookto make a special payment in the prices for 1951/52 to cover the additional costs which would be carried by the farmers in 1950/51 ifa Special Price Review was postponed.    The amount involved is  5^-millions.    It is quite outside any estimate of recoupment required for1951/52.    It will have to be added to the price of the different commodities in proportion to the way in which increased wage costs fall.    It is dis-regarded in, and will be additional to, any recoupment discussed in therest of this paper.5. Wool.    The present guaranteed price which the farmers receive is2s. 3d a lb. ; the wool is selling at about 12s. Od.    The surplus less lOpercent goes into a special fund and is available for five years to meet any future shortfall ii receipts by the Wool Marketing Board after paying the farmers the guaranteed price.    If there is not sufficient in the fund tomeet such a shortfall money has to be voted to implement the guaranteeand the Exchequer therefore has an interest in the level of the fund.    Atthe end of five years, however, anything remaining in the fund is paid overto the farmers and the whole process starts again.    At the end of this(the first) year there will be about  17^ millions set aside in the fund andwe could afford to let the farmers have a guaranteed price of 5s. Od or6s. Od without any real risk that we should have to vote money to implement the guarantee before the end of the five yearly period.    The farmers claimtherefore that any extra price we allow on wool is their own money and out-side price recoupment.   On the other hand whatever we allow (from  4jmillions to  9f millions - see paragraph 11) is quite clearly income and shouldbe taken into account in deciding what price recoupment on other commoditiesis needed to achieve a given target income.    Of course the less the farmersget now the more they will have at the end of the first quinquennium and ifwool prices remain very high there will be a very big addition to theirincomes on the disposal of the surplus, an addition which it will be difficultto fit into the Price Review procedure.    It must nevertheless be concededthat it is difficult for the National Farmers&apos; Unions to explain to theindividual farmers that a large part of the price recoupment in a year of heavy increased costs is being given in respect of wool which manyfarmers do not themselves produce.The Farmers&apos; Case6. The farmers have rejected our offer and are asking for  55 millionswith no capital injection withdrawal.    We think, however, that they will come below this figure.    They base their claim on the following grounds:-(a) They consider that too much stress has been placed on a partic-ular calculation of farm income:  other calculations examined at the review point to a declining trend.    All the calculationsconsidered show a declining trend in cash spendable incomes.(b) They challenge as inadequate the allowance of  28 millions madein respect of increased production of  350 millions since1946/47 in the build-up of the target net income of  273 millions(see paragraph 53 of E.P.C.(51) 17).    They consider that the allowance made is too low by  15 millions.(c) There is likely to be a further rise in costs during 1951/52 whichthe farmers will have to bear and this together with any increased taxation will make it difficult for them to find thenecessary further capital investment.
(d) They are already finding it difficult to get the credit from banksand merchants which they need.    This may be partly the resultof the bad harvest last year and, in the case of merchants, thelarger proportion of/their funds tied up in carrying stocks;whatever the reason it is an embarrassment to the farmers.(e) The average profit is no more than  800 a farm which has tocover the remuneration for the labour of the farmer and his wife, interest on capital, further capital investment necessary and the whole of the risk,(f) Other incomes, including wages, and profits are rising and the farmers&apos; profits should not be reduced at such a time.(g) The Government are still asking for an increase of production andthere is a large unsatisfied demand for food in the country.The effect on production of under-recoupment of cost increases will be serious.(h) We are paying substantially higher prices for our imports of food and should not deny higher prices, based on higher costs, to ourown farmers.The Minister of Food&apos;s View7. The Minister of Food considers that our present offer of  35millions (before withdrawing  10 millions capital) is fully adequate tosecure tin food which the country requires at prices consumers will pay.(We do not want a general increase of production;  what is needed is a shift ofproduction from milk into meat.)    In general, he points out that the income of farmers is four to five times greater than before the war, although net output is but 45 per cent greater and labour costs have increased only two and a half times;  although import prices are rising, the prices of manyhome-produced foodstuffs especially subsidised foodstuffs are already much higher than those of imported supplies; the gap between the price paid tothe farmer and what the consumer pays is already dangerously high andmust not be widened;  and lastly, we have already to face in the next twelvemonths the prospect of rising retail food prices by a very substantial amount (see E.P.C.(51) 4).8. He emphasises that the global award on food cannot be consideredwithout taking account of its consequences on the price of individual commodities; the breakdown of the award among commodities has also tobe negotiated with the farmers.    An award of  25 millions net on food aloneentails by common consent at least jd a gallon on milk and the farmers maywell ask for more.    Any excess above  25 millions net would also, it is agreed, have to fall almost entirely on milk.    This would run counter tothe policy agreed at the Economic Policy Committee (see E.P.C.(51) 4thMeeting).    Moreover, an award of  25 millions net would enable us tomake very substantial increases in the prices of fatstockand pigs (see annex B);  to the extent that there is not a sufficient disincentive on milk,the attraction of these higher prices is reduced.9. The offer of  35 millions was meant to include some increase inthe price of wool (which we had notionally put at  4^ millions) and the mostthe Minister of Food feels able to concede is to offer  35 millions (beforecapital withdrawal) on food prices alone, letting the farmers also have, ifthey wish it, a price of 5s. 6d a lb. ( 9f millions) on wool.    This wouldgive the farmers  44f millions before capital withdrawal and is more than
they would need on a statistical basis.    At this point therefore theMinister of Food would stand firm even if ,it meant a break with the farmers involving scheduling prices and all the political and other diffi-culties which would follow.    He feels that we should have an overwhelmingvolume of support from the country at large.The Agriculture Ministers&apos; View10. The Minister of Agriculture regards our present offer asinadequate, mainly for the reasons given by the farmers themselves.   Hepoints out in addition that once this offer has been translated into increases in the price of individual commodities all that the ordinary farmer willknow is that he has been seriously under-recouped for the increase in hiscosts of production of each commodity.    This will be regarded as a verypoor reward for all that the farmers have done to increase production offood supplies for this country with, as a result, a substantial saving of dollars.    Severe under-recoupment this year will follow upon under-recoupment in each of the last two years and the cumulative effect is bound to have some result on the level of production and completion of theagricultural expansion programme.    If an increase in the price of wool isgiven (even only to 3s, 9d) there will be a saving to the Exchequer of about 1-1 millions on the hill sheep subsidy.    The Minister of Agriculture sharesthe scepticism of the farmers about the reliability of the target net incomeapproach as the determining factor in fixing prices.    It necessarily assumes that output, efficiency, etc. remain constant, as between the current y$arand the year for which prices are being fixed, and that the calculations canbe made free of all errors of forecast;  in a changing world these assump-tions are never borne out by events.    Finally he points to the very serious political difficulties of a break with the farmers, which will undoubtedlymean trouble in the House and possibly a Censure Motion, at this time.The Minister of Agriculture has suggested as a compromise on the Ministerof Food&apos;s proposal that we might let the farmers have  40millions (beforecapital withdrawal) on food prices and as much on wool, between  4^-millions and  9f millions, as may be necessary to secure agreement.The Secretary of State for Scotland concurs.Conclusion11. Annex A shows the effect of these two proposals on farmers&apos;incomes.    The manner in which the offers can be broken down among thedifferent commodities is shown in Annexes B and C, but they are given only for purposes of illustration since our negotiators must be left with somelatitude in fixing individual prices with the farmers.    We are all agreedthat we must now ask our colleagues to decide upon the final offer at whichwe would if necessary break with the farmers.    Our negotiators would leadup to this offer gradually, probably keeping something in hand for ministers to use if necessary.    The question on which we therefore need a decision from our colleagues is at what point do we make this final stand which may involve a break with the farmers and the scheduling of prices.    the alternatives for consideration are:-(a)  35 millions (or after capital withdrawal  25 millions) on food prices with  9f millions on wool.(b)  40 millions ( 30 millions after capital withdrawal) on food prices with as much on wool between  4^ millions and  9^ millions asmay be necessary to secure agreement.H.G.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,16TH MARCH, 1951. .   --4-

The estimated net income includes  hh-g million for increased value of stocks.    Although this is income,it is not available as cash to the farmers, and we cannottell whether it will be repeated in 1951/2J this depends on cost increases in that year.    Some allowance for-this factor has therefore been made in the calculation (see note on Item 9).-1-
Item 2.    The target is made up of a basic income of 205 million in 191+6/7 +  1+0 million capital injection4-  28 million for increased production.Item 9.    This allowance consists of an addition totake care of the valuation change (see note on Item l)and a deduction for increased efficiency.    The net figurehas been put at  10 million.
