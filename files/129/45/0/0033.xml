secret.P.(51) 108 COPY NO.   ^113TH APRIL, 1951&apos; CABINETSCHUMAN PLANALLIED CONTROL OF GERMAN HEAVY industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs* JAt the meeting of the Inter-Governmental Study Group on 10thApril, an important statement of proposed policy towards German indusrty was made unofficially on behalf of the French Government.    First, theFrench Government intends to propose that as soon as the Schuman treaty is signed there should be discussions between the three Occupying Power?and, to the extent that they are concerned, the Benelux countries, about the conflict of jurisdiction between the Schuman Treaty institutions on the onehand and Allied controls over German coal and steel and the international authority for the Ruhr (I.A.R.) on the other.   Second, during these dis-cussions the French Government proposes to take the line that as soon aspracticable after the Schuman Treaty comes into force through ratificationin the Parliaments of member countries the functions of the I.A.R. and ofthe High Commission in respect of German coal and steel should cease, andthe present limitations on German steel production and capacity under theAgreement on Industrial Controls should be removed,    (cf. C.P.(51) 89,paragraph 17 of Annex, penultimate sentence).    Third, the French Govern-ment will, at the time when the Treaty is signed, inform the GermanGovernment of their intentions and proposals as summarised above.2. Consideration of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towardsthese proposals is urgent.    The discussions preceding the signature ofthe Schuman Treaty started on 12th April in Paris, and the Treaty willprobably be signed very soon.   Whether or not the French give publicity to their declaration of intentions, we may be sure that it will not remain a secret.    The French no doubt anticipate that Dr. Adenauer will find their declaration a useful means of influencing German opinion in favourof the Schuman Plan, and they may well wish to gain some credit in germany at the expense of their Allies.   Ratification of the Treaty by the Parlia-ments of all member Governments is not likely to occur for a considerable period thereafter (if at all).    The French proposals will not therefore take effect for some time, but their intention to announce their policy in advancemeans that the other Occupying Powers cannot afford to hesitate in making up their minds on the questions at issue, and in informing the Germans oftheir views.    The United States Government can be expected fully to endorse the French proposals.3. In these circumstances, Ministers will no doubt wish to determinetheir policy on the main points raised by the French, i. e. the necessityfor the continued existence of I.A.R., the Combined Coal and Steel ControlGroups, and the need to maintain limits on German steel production and capacity.rHI3^0CUM&amp;NT-4S-T-HETRO
4.International Authority for the Ruhr.A study of the draft Schuman Treat y confirms the expectation that its objects and the functions of the proposed High Authority overlapto a very large extent with the obj ects of the Ruhr Agreement and thefunctions of the I.A.R,    The only important task actually performed bythe I.A.R. has been to direct German coal production between domestic purposes and export.    It is doubtful whether, in face of increasingopposition from the Germans, it could continue effectively to perform this task, and it is desirable that the main importers of German coal, who arealso participants in the Schuman scheme, should have their needs satisfiedunderftiat scheme, in which the Germans will join much more readily.    Iconsider that on this ground alone the abolition of the I.A.R. is inevitable.Moreover, the functions of the I.A.R. which are not covered by the schuman plan High Authority are those which overlap most noticeably with thepowers of the High Commission.    The I.A.R. cannot be r-egarded as an effective instrument for maintaining control over the re-cartelisation ofGerman industry or the nature of its ownership or management.    TheHigh Commission has broken down the Ruhr concentrations and in thepolitical circumstances of Germany today we must rely on the germans to maintain the industrial patterns which the Occupying Powers will have established before they surrender their reserved powers (see paragraph below).    Further, there are general arguments of a political character infavour of dissolving I.A.R. at this stage.    The abolition of I.A.R. would be popular in Germany as removing what the Germans have always regardedas a servitude imposed upon them and an obstacle to equal status in theWestern European community.    For our part, it will be recalled that we agreed to the establishment of the I.A.R. largely because we wished toobtain French agreement to the establishment of a German federal government;  if the French, in view of the establishment of the schuman plan High Authority, are willing to contemplate the abolition of the I.A.R.,we may regard ourselves as honourably discharged from that bargain,5. I therefore recommend that, in view of the overlap of functions between the I.A.R. and the Schuman Plan High Authority and the other con-siderations mentioned in paragraph 4, we should take part in discussions regarding the future of the LA.R, and should agree to its dissolution assoon as it can be replaced by machinery set up under the Schuman Plan.6. The Allied High Commission^ powers over German coal andsteel.The powers of the Allied High Commission are exercised throughthe Combined (Tripartite) Coal and Steel Groups, and a distinction must bedrawn between the machinery (which might well be abolished) and certain of the powers (which might still have to be exercised).    Subject to theviews of the United Kingdom High Commissioner, it may be said that thefunctions of the Groups in respect of increasing German coal and steel production are outdated.    The control of investment has comparatively small importance in respect of the coal industry.    In respect of steel, thecontrol of investment involves security functions which would be super-fluous if the limitation on capacity were removed in accordance with the   -French proposal (see paragraphs 8 to 12 below).    In any case any remain-ing control function might be exercised as well by the Military SecurityBoard as by the Steel Group.    By far the most important function of the groups is to supervise the reorganisation of the coal and- steel industries under Allied High Commission Law 27.    The main task - the formation ofnew companies - should be completed by the end of the year, i. e. probablybefore the French proposal for abolishing the High Commissioners powers could take effect.    It is, however, essential that, irrespective of themachinery by which this task is carried out, the High Commission should retain powers to supervise the completion of the reorganisation of thecoal and steel industries. o..
7. In this case therefore I recommend to my colleagues that weshould agree to join the talks after the Treaty is signed regarding thefuture functions of the Allied High Commission in respect of the Germaniron and coal industries, and that subject to the views of the HighCommissioner which are being sought, we should agree during these discussions to the abolition of the Groups, provided that the functionsnow performed by them in connection with Law 27 should be carried outby the High Commission until the reorganisation of the German coal andsteel industries is completed, or until we have some guarantee or con-contractual arrangement with the German Federal Government to carry outAllied policies and programmes in this field.8. Removal of present limitations on steel production and capacity.The present position is that there is a nominal limitation on german crude steel production of 11.1 million tons per annum, but steelused or exported for the purposes of Western Defence is permitted outsidethis quota.    This control, which was instituted as a temporary systemafter the New Yorkmeeting of Foreign Ministers in September, 1950, and hasbeen maintained in the Agreement on Industrial Controls of March, 1951,at the insistence of the French, is more nominal than real and is largelyunworkable.   German steel production has been fluctuating between annualrates of 13. 3 and 12. 0 million tons in the last six months.    The controls on steel production and finishing capacity in the Agreement on IndustrialControls are operated on a licensing system which permits additions andmodernisations provided they do not substantially increase the capacity ofthe plant in question.9. Under the Schuman Plan arrangements now proposed by theFrench, there wotild be no limitation on production as such, but any extension of capital plant requiring new investment is liable to scrutinyby the relevant organs of the High Authority.    Approved projects may receive direct or indirect financial assistance from the Authority.Projects which are not approved will be entirely dependent on the funds ofthe enterprise concerned.    The text of the relevant Article 54 of the schuman Plan Treaty is attached (Annex ). .    It is difficult to say how thisprovision will workout in practice but it is safe to assume that, at least in the initial period, the French will use every means open to them toprevent a rapid increase in German capacity for crude steel production orfor steel finishing.10. Under the policy, approved by the three Foreign Ministers in brussels and now being worked out in detail, of placing upon a contractualbasis all reserved powers now exercised by the High Commission except those which must be reserved for a Peace Treaty, there will be little prospect of retaining effective controls over German steel production orcapacity.    It is, moreover, our avowed intention to bring Western Germanyfully into the community of western nations as an equal partner withoutdisabilities save those imposed by the absen ce of a formal Peace Treaty,the occupation of Germany in the interests of Western Defence and themaintenance of our position in Berlin.    From this point of view there iseverything to be said for removing existing controls on production and capacity at an early date.    These controls were instituted for securitypurposes.    The Chiefs of Staff agreed at a meeting on 12th February, 1951,that the security risk involved in waiving restrictions on steel-making capacity was acceptable.    They added that there would be definiteadvantage if the lifting of restrictions were to result in an increase in the availability of steel for Western rearmament as a whole.    Even in theabsence of a German military contribution, German industry, with steelas its core, can be of substantial assistance to Western Defence programmes
and the prolongation of controls camot fail to discourage the germans from providing such assistance. Moreover, it is very doubtful whether,in terms of our German policy, we can afford to stand out for longagainst Franco-American agreement to remove these controls, even ifwe wish to do so.11. I fully realise the need to maximise imports of steel scrap fromGermany if our steel industry is to maintain its production.   The french proposal, by substituting a loose control by a new and untried body of whichwe are not members, for a close control by the High Commission, may bethought likely to result in substantial increases in German steel capacity and thus further reduce the scrap available for export.    I would notpretend that this danger does not exist.    But our prospects, which are inany event poor, of obtaining adequate quantities of scrap from Germany  -depend, in my view,far more on German efforts to increase scrap produc-tion than on the level of production in the German steel industry.    if anything could increase German scrap production, the removal of existingcontrols on German steel capacity might do so.   Our insistence on their maintenance in the face of our Allies could only reduce our prospects ofobtaining German scrap.    Insofar as our difficulties in obtaining scrap leadus, as I believe they may, into purchasing semi-finished steel in germany in its stead, the removal of existing controls on steel production and capacity should operate to our advantage.12. In view of the considerations set forth in paragraphs 10 and 11above, I recommend that we should participate in the discussions proposedby the French concerning the present limitations on the German steelindustry and should agree to their removal when the Schuman Plan Treatytakes effect.13.      .  Declaration of Policy.Given the French intention to announce their policy in advance(paragraphs 1 and 2 above), it seems essential that we should be in aposition to do the same.   A failure to do so would be interpreted by theGermans as indicating a more restrictive policy towards German industry than that of the French, and might be used by the German opponents of the schuman Plan as evidence of our opposition to it and thus used to delayratification.   This could be very damaging to our relations with western europe and with the United States.14, If therefore we are prepared to associate ourselves eventuallywith the French proposals, I recommend that we should let this be knownto the Germans at an early date, and should be prepared to give publicity to our views if the French or Americans do so to theirs,15, Recommendations,I ask my colleagues to approve the recommendations that weshould agree to the disappearance of the Ruhr Authority (paragraph 5) ofthe Coal and Steel Groups (paragraph 7), and of the existing controls on german steel production and capacity (paragraph 12), to take effect assoon as practicable after the Schuman Plan Treaty becomes operative.16. I also ask my colleagues to agree that we should be ready to announce this policy at short notice in the circumstances described inparagraph 14.Foreign Office, S.W.1,13TH APRIL, 1951.H.M.
ANNEXARTICLE 54The High Authority may facilitate the carrying out of investmentprograms by granting loans to enterprises or by giving its guarantee toloans which they may obtain elsewhere.With the concurrence of the Council acting by unanimous vote,the High Authority may assist by the same means in financing works and -installations which contribute directly and principally to increase produc-tion, lower production costs or facilitate marketing of products subjectto its jurisdiction.In order to encourage a coordinated development of investments,the High Authority may, in accordance with the provisions of Article 48,require enterprises to submit individual programs in advance, either bya special demand addressed to the enterprise concerned or by a decisiondefining the nature and the size of the programs which must be submitted.Within the framework of the general programs described inArticle 46, the High Authority may, after having given the interested parties an opportunity to present their views, issue an opinion on suchprograms, accompanied by a justification.   It is obliged to issue such an opinion when so requested by an enterprise.    The High Authority shallnotify the enterprise of its opinion and shall bring it to the attention ofthe government concerned.   The list of opinions shall be made public.If the High Authority recognises that the financing of a programor the operation of the installations which it entails will require subsidies,assistance, protection or discrimination contrary to the present Treaty,the unfavorable opinion taken by virtue of this justification shall have theforce of a decision as defined in Article 14, and shall have the effect ofprohibiting the enterprise concerned from resort to resources other thanits own funds to put such program into effect.The High Authority may impose fines not exceeding the sumsunduly devoted to realisation of the program in question on enterpriseswhich violate the provisions of the above paragraph.

(51) 10916th April, 1951CABINETVISIT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR commonwealth relations TO THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA, SOUTHERNRHODESIA AND THE THREE HIGH COMMISSION territories of BASUTOLAND, THE BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE ANDSWAZILANDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations am circulating this report for the information of my colleagues. I am afraidit is long, but I visited three different and difficult areas. I have sub-divided thereport as follows:  (i) Southern Rhodesia (paragraphs 3 to 11).(ii) High Commission Territories (paragraphs 12 to 21).(iii) Union of South Africa (paragraphs 22 to 34).(iv) Problems of Policy (paragraphs 35 to 55).Some of my colleagues may prefer to read only the conclusions I have formed.These are in section (iv).2. I spent six weeks in January and February this year travelling in the Unionof South Africa and Southern Rhodesia as the guest of the two Governments andin the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland and Swaziland. In that time Itravelled by air, road and rail some 17,000 miles.(i). Southern Rhodesia3. Southern Rhodesia is still in many ways like an enlarged County Council.Its white population is 129,000. The general level of Ministers and Civil servants and business men is not high: but there are a few outstanding exceptions in allthese classes. Trade Union and Labour leaders are. not impressive. The LabourParty is small and split. The Trade Unions are extremely colour-conscious andenforce a rigid colour bar in the fields they control (particularly housing). Theyseek to exclude Africans from all skilled and semi-skilled building labour (and indeed from what we would here classify as unskilled labour) in the towns. Throughtraining schools, African builders are becoming quite good though they cannot yet,in any numbers, work as well as the whites and they lack persistence. Nevertheless,I saw some excellent African-built houses, schools and hospitals. Their cost isabout half as much as similar buildings put up by European labour. With theexception of the small Labour element the whole of Southern Rhodesia seems tobe pro-Churchill and conservative in British politics, in which they are veryinterested. Even many of the Labour people think the British Labour Party hasinnocent and Utopian ideas about race-relations. In their own internal affairs theyare, however, quite radical and readily create State industries in fields such as ironand steel and railways in which they think we are stupid to have done so.4. In general Southern Rhodesia is a happy and prosperous country. It has very considerable resources (doubtless much more than have yet been discovered).The population is pretty vigorous and virile. The country is suffering now from the40458 . b
