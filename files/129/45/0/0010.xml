BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION - FINANCIAL position memorandum by the Minister of transport as a result of the Cabinet discussion on 15th March about thereceipts and expenditure of the British Transport Commission I wasIinvited (C.M.(51) 20th Conclusions, Minute 3), in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to bring before the Cabinet at their next meeting revised proposals regarding the charges schemes which theBritish Transport Commission should put before the Transport tribunal for main-line railway fares and London fares.I have consulted with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and withthe Chairman of the British Transport Commission and have been unableto come to firm conclusions on which revised proposals could be based.Further discussions may, however, perhaps lead to some modificationof the Commissions present proposals so as to bear less hardly on theLondon area, while at the same time enabling the Commission to complywith their statutory obligations.In accordance with the authority given to me by the Cabinet on12th March (CM.(51) 19th Conclusions, Minute 4) I have also had a preliminary discussion with the permanent members of the transport tribunal in regard to an overall increase of 10 per cent in railway, dock,and canal freight charges.    I think that it is probable that the Tribunalwill be prepared to give me their advice on this proposed increase withoutrequiring a public hearing.     If this is so, the increase could be broughtinto force at an early date and so ease the immediate financial position ofthe Commission.    This should enable me to make a statement in the Houseof Commons Ids c e the Easter Recess, and I seek my colleagues&apos; approval to this course and to the attached draft of the statement I should proposeto make.A.B.COPY NO.   31Ministry of Transport, W. 1,17TH MARCH, 1951.HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT),HMaBMM*MMaMMHHaaaW       Mi M M a Mi - Mt M .w .M1 M.

DRAFT STATEMENT TO BE MADE IN THE HOUSE OF &quot;commons as a result of the recent increases in railway wages and othersubstantial increases in their costs the British Transport Commissionestimate that at current levels of charges there will be a deficit on theirnet revenue for 1951 of  25 millions.    This sum is, of course, in additionto their accumulated deficit on net revenue which amounted at the end of1950 to  40 millions.Under the Transport Act the Commission are required to securethat their revenue is not less than sufficient for meeting charges properlychargeable to revenue taking one year with another.    For this purpose theyare required to submit draft charges schemes to the Transport tribunal for confirmation.    Pending the coming into force of such schemes Section82 of the Act empowers me, in order to meet just such a situation as has arisen, to make regulations authorising an increase of charges if I thinkit expedient to do so, with a view to securing a sufficient revenue to theCommission.    Before doing so, the Act requires me to consult, and considerthe advice of, the permanent members of the Transport Tribunal.In the light of their financial situation the Commission have asked me to exercise my powers under this section with a view to an immediate increase of 10per cent in railway freight charges, parcel rates, and dock and canal charges.    The total yield of this increase in a full year is estimatedat  20 millions.    As required by the Act I have consulted the permanent members of the Tribunal and expect shortly to receive their advice.This procedure is intended only as an immediate relief to theCommission and to prevent an undue enlargement of their deficit during theperiod required for the settlement of their charges schemes.    The Corn-mission propose to submit such schemes covering passenger fares both in-1-
London and the rest of the country very shortly.    By August nextthey intend to submit to the Transport Tribunal a draft scheme todeal with freight charges generally.     These schemes taken togetherwill be designed to enable the Commission to discharge their obligation under the Act of balancing their revenue and expenditure.    They willnot, of course, come into effect before they have been thoroughlyexamined and approved, and if necessary modified, by the Tribunal.-Z-
