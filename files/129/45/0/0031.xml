THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS   government confidential, - .., \oz , ,r\.        Copy No.CP. (51) 106 ^^-^^^^iS^^Z.\6th April, 1951Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 11th September, 1950, my predecessor placed before the Cabinet for their consideration a paper (CP. (50) 197) dealing with various proposals which were then being put forward by the United States for ways of meeting aggressionpromptly within the framework of the Charter of the United Nations (CM. (50)57th Conclusions, Minute 1).2. The general purpose of these proposals was to put teeth into the united nations by arranging to circumvent Russian abuse of the veto and by ensuring that a United Nations force could be made available to resist aggressors. Sovietobstruction in the Security Council was to be overcome by allowing the general assembly to act in cases where the Security Council was prevented from so doingand a variety of proposals for the setting up of a United Nations force were venti-lated.   Among them was one for the formation of a United Nations Legion.3. It was agreed by my colleagues at that time that there was serious objectionto this proposal and that the Foreign Secretary should endeavour to dissuade theUnited States Government from pursuing it. In due course (and at our suggestion)the United States dropped the idea of a Legion, but separately tabled at the general assembly of the United Nations a resolution called &quot; Uniting for Peace&quot;&quot; on thelines of the general proposals stated above. At our invitation the United Statesagreed to drop a number of further suggestions which we considered ill advised,and in the end we both co-sponsored and voted for the Resolution.4. The Americans are, however, again hankering after the idea of a Legion.They have asked us to agree to discussion of the proposal in the so-called CollectiveMeasures Committee, which forms part of the machinery set up under the &quot; Unitingfor Peace &quot; Resolution. They have indicated that they would be prepared to limitwork done to a definition of the problems and difficulties which would arise, and do not wish us to come to any decision on the merits of the Legion or to put forward proposals for its creation.5. I am satisfied that nothing done in the Collective Measures Committeecan commit governments to any course of action in any future situation. I there-fore recommend that our Delegation in New York be now authorised to agree tothe inclusion of an item on &quot; a United Nations Legion &quot; in the agenda for thefollowing principal reasons:  (a) We voted for the &quot; Uniting for Peace&quot; Resolution, and it would be unfortunate if we appeared to be reluctant even to discuss action of thekind which that Resolution considers;(b) The Committee must be given something substantial to work on, and this item is less dangerous than some of the other ideas suggested by theUnited States;(c) In agreeing to the discussion of this item, there is no implication that wehave in any way modified our views of the practical difficulties whichwould be likely to arise if there were ever an attempt to put this projectinto effect;Printed for the Cabinet.

(rf) Even if we oppose discussion of this proposal^ we&apos; are unlikely to convince the Americans or the Committee. Discussion will therefore almost certainly take place, whatever we do.a* &apos; 6.&quot;^Finally, the Chiefs of Staff now see no objection to a study of the proposal in the Committee, provided it is only &quot; studied &quot; and that the Committee &quot;makes no final decision.&quot; &quot;i     H. M.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,\6th April, 1951.
