Annextext cf dra:ft telegram to h.m. ambassador in tehranand of draft reply to persian prime minister&apos;^message of 8th may, 1951.My telegram No. 363 /of 8th May:  Persian Prime Ministersmessage on oiL/My immediately following telegram contains the text of an aide Memoire replying to Mussadiq&apos;s message contained in my telegram under reference which you should communicate to him at theearliest possible moment.   A copy will also be given to the PersianAmbassador here.2. In making this communication, you should leave Mussadiq inno doubt that the tone of his message has created a deplorableimpression here.   I have been at pains to make clear, both in the Houseof Commons and in previous messages to him, that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment while not prepared to negotiate under duress were anxiousto settle this matter by negotiation.   Mussadiq&apos;s response appears to bea flat rejection of this approach and a reassertion of his intention toproceed by unilateral action.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot accept this procedure,which smacks of a technique with which we have become all too familiarin other parts of the world, but which we did not expect to encounter in a country with whom we have long had such close and friendly relations.As you have already pointed out to him, dispossession of the Companycould only lead to economic chaos in Persia and consequently would produce exactly the contrary of those aims which he professes to bepursuing, and with which we fully sympathise.   We are not prepared withfolded arms to watch him embark on a course from which only the communists can profit.   We are convinced of the strength of the Company1 legal position, and of our own right to intervene to protect its interestsif the Persian Government refuse its demand for arbitration and ourinvitation to negotiate.   Precipitate action by Dr. Musaddiq could not fail to have the most serious consequences for Persia.Draft Message to Persian Prime Minister from Foreign secretary i have received through His Imperial Majesty*s Ambassador inLondon your reply to the message which I sent to you through him on 2nd May.  I regret to find that it contains no response to the suggestion which I made, and which I have since reaffirmed publicly, that HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom wish to see the questionof the future operations of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in Persiasettled by negotiation, but instead appears to assert a right by the ImperialGovernment of Iran to proceed by unilateral action to dispossess the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government fully understand and sympathise with the desire of the Iranian Government to strengthen the economic structure of their country and to provide for the general welfare of its
people.   They themselves have constantly shown in practical waysthat these objects are of deep concern to them.   They find it difficultto believe, however, that the unilateral action which the PersianGovernment are proposing to take will contribute towards theirfulfilment.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government moreover neither desire norintend to question the exercise by Iran of any sovereign rights which she may legitimately exercise.   They maintain, however, that theaction now proposed against the Company is not a legitimate exerciseof those rights.   The 1933 Agreement between the Iranian Governmentand the Company has a double character.   First, it is a contract between the Persian Government and a foreign Company concludedunder the auspices of the League of Nations after an attempt by thePersian Government to deprive the Company of its rights under itsprevious concession had been brought by His Majesty&apos;s government before the League of Nations.   Secondly, it was ratified by the Majlisand became a Persian Law,   Further, the Agreement contains two very important provisions:(a) that the position of the Company under its agreement shall never be altered by action of the Iranian Government oreven by Iranian legislation (Article 21) except as the resultof an agreement between the Company and the Iranian government,(b) that if the Persian Government had any complaint against theCompany or vice versa and the dispute could not be settledotherwise, it was to be referred to arbitration (Article 22),the arbitral tribunal being presided over by an umpireappointed by the arbitrators themselves or, in default oftheir agreement, by the President of the International Courtof Justice at The Hague,4, These two Articles show that this agreement was placed onquite a different footing from an ordinary contract between the Iranian government and a Company, in that (a) disputes arising out of it werenot to be subject to the Persian Courts, and (b) the Iranian Governmentwas bound not to exercise what might have otherwise been its sovereignright of altering or annulling the Agreement in return for compensation.5. If as Your Excellency claims the Iranian Government hadgrievances against the Company, its remedy, as I have shown above, wasto seek arbitration.   That course has not been adopted.   Instead, the iranian Parliament have enacted a law which envisages a fundamental change in the status of the Company,   The Company therefore had no alter-native but to make known to the Iranian Government its wish to take thewhole matter to arbitration,6, The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company is a British Companyregistered in the United Kingdom; moreover, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentown a majority of the shares in the Company,   It is clear therefore thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government have the fullest right to protect its interestsin every way they properly can.   The Company has had its valuable rightsestablished under the Agreement injuriously affected by an Iranianenactment when Article 21 provided that this should not be so.   TheCompany has appealed to the only remedy which is open to it, namely,arbitration under Article 22,   If that remedy should be rendered illusoryby the Iranian Government, His Majesty&apos;s Government would have an
unanswerable right under international law to tale up the case, and,if they deemed it expedient, to bring their complaint against the iranian Government before the International Court of Justice at TheHague.   In that contingency they would hope that the Iranian Govern-ment would collaborate in enabling the Court to give a decision as quickly as possible,7. On the other hand, His Majesty&apos;s Government still hopethat the problem can be solved by negotiation to the satisfaction of allconcerned.   The Company&apos;s offer to discuss the terms of a new agreement had already been conveyed to the Iranian Government, andI take this opportunity to reaffirm that His Majesty&apos;s Government areprepared to arrange for a Mission to proceed forthwith to Tehran for thispurpose.   They earnestly trust that Your Excellency will be prepared toagree to this procedure and to conduct negotiations with this Missionon a fair and equitable basis.8, In conclusion, I note that Your Excellency has reciprocatedthe desire which I have already expressed to you of maintaining good relations and strengthening the foundation of friendship between iran and the United Kingdom.   I should, however, be less than frank if I did not say that a refusal on the part of the Iranian Government tonegotiate, or any attempt on their part to proceed by unilateral action tothe implementation of the recent legislation, could not fail gravely toimpair those friendly relations which we both wish to exist and to havethe most serious consequences.
