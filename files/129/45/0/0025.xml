&apos; 158    &apos;HIS DOCUMENT- IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (51) 100 COPY NO. 313RD APRIL. 1S51- CABINETADDITIONAL MEASURES BY THE UNITED NATIONS AGAINST china memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe United Nations General Assembly Resolution of1st February, 1951, set up a Good Offices Committee and also aCommittee, composed of the members of the Collective MeasuresCommittee &quot;to consider additional measures to be employed tomeet this aggression and to report thereon to the general assembly, it, being understood that the Committee is authorisedto defer its report if the Good Offices Committee ... reportssatisfactory progress in its efforts.&quot;   This ad hoc Committeeis known as the Additional Measures Committee.DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE PASSING OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION2. For two months we have been urging that the emphasis should be placed on the work of the Good Offices Committee andthat the Additional Measures Committee should avoid any hastyor indiscreet action which might prejudice the former^ acti-vities.   The Good Offices Committee has made no progress, and^ we have put forward proposals for a negotiated settlement onKorea.3* In the meantime, the United States Government havebeen anxious that the Additional Measures Committee should beginstudying what additional measures could be employed againstChina if the Good Offices&quot;Committee fails.   As a preliminary,they suggested some weeks ago that it would be desirable forthem and us to have &quot;desk-level talks&quot; between officials in washington to clear the ground.   We accepted this suggestion onan entirely non-committal basis, not only because this might help to spin out time, but also because it would be valuable toknow and if possible to influence American views while theywere still in a formative state.   Our stalling tactics havethus far been successful, but the time has now come when theUnited Kingdom Representative on the Additional MeasuresCommittee can no longer refrain from some expression of views.It is therefore necessary to take certain decisions at this stage.POSSIBLE POLITICAL SANCTIONSIt is understood from the desk-level talks in washington that the following possible political sanctions arefavoured by the United States Government:-(a) Countries which have not yet recognised the central people&apos;s Government of China should refrain from doing so.(b) Countries which have recognised, but have not yetestablished diplomatic relations, should refrain from sendingdiplomatic representatives to Peking.(c) Possible agreement that no representatives of thePeople!s Government should be allowed into United Nations bodiesuntil, for instance, the Chinese should have ceased their aggression in Korea.a-
(d)     Refusal to recognise any territorial gains resultingfrom aggressive activities of the People&apos;s Government,5* It may be necessary for political reasons to provide some outlet for feeling against China in the United Nations,but it should be realised that none of the preceding coursesseem likely either to persuade China to mend her ways or todecrease her war potential.   It is also to be noted that:-(i)     Recognition of a regime ought not to be either grantedor withheld on moral grounds once the facts of its stability and its control of its territory are established beyond reasonabledoubt.       Several statements to this effect have been made onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, both in Parliament and inthe United Nations,   To agree therefore to the first of the fourcourses of action would run counter to our declared policy,(ii)     As regards not sending diplomatic representatives toPeking, this would isolate China still more from the West,(iii)     The same considerations as in (i) above apply to thequestion of Chinese representation, and are strengthened bythe fact that the Charter of the United. Nations lays down thatChina is not only a member of the United Nations but also apermanent member of the Security Council,(iv)     Refusal to recognise any territorial gains resultingfrom China&apos;s aggressive activities is acceptable provided itis understood as referring to de .iure recognition of such gains,6. In brief, the possible sanctions outlined in para-graph k above are unsatisfactory and unlikely to achieve the required effect.   They may well provoke strong Russian counter-action in the United Nations (with consequent danger to theUnited Nations Organisation as a whole) and also create a splitbetween the Asian and Western countries, thus playing intoCommunist hands.   The arguments outlined in paragraph 5 above are set out in greater detail in Annex A (Foreign Office telegram813 Saving to Washington),ECONOMIC SANCTIONS7&quot;    (a)       The only economic sanction which is under discussion is a United Nations selective embargo.   From our desk-leveltalks, we know that such an embargo is envisaged by the state department in the form of a resolution calling on members ofthe United Nations to place an embargo on the export to Chinaof(i)   petrol, oil and lubricants,(ii)   atomic energy materials,(iii)    arms and ammunition,(iv)    implements of war, and(v)   items useful for the production of (i) - (iv) above.They suggest that it might be left to individual countries to interpret what commodities fall within these categories, althoughit would have to be made clear that countries should not defeatcontrols imposed by others.   These proposals seem to be the veryminimum likely to find support in the United States Administration,The State Department hope, too, that like-minded nations would go further, as the Americans have done, outside the framework of the United Nations,
(b) There are several other possible economic sanctions,but as they are not live issues, I do not propose to deal withthem here. There are references to. them in Annex B (telegramNo. 811+ Saving to Washington).8. There might be considerable support for a selectiveembargo against China in the United Nations if it had as its purpose the denial of goods of prime importance to the Chinesewar effort.      Items, selected would mostly be covered by the listof goods whose export to China and the Soviet bloc is alreadyprohibited by certain Western countries co-operating throughthe Paris Consultative Group.     Thus, a United Nations selec-tive embargo of strategic- materials would close to China alonesources of supply outside the Paris Group and might help toprevent leakage through re-export from countries other than theSoviet bloc which are not members of the Paris Group.9* Chinese reactions to a selective embargo are diffi-cult to estimate.      It is possible that China might ignore itentirely, as she did when controls over vital strategic materials and oil were first instituted in the summer of 1950.Chinese propaganda has recently been stressing the &quot;futilityof the imperialist blockade&quot; and the country&apos;s independence of&quot;imperialist and capitalist economy&quot;.     Even a selectiveembargo, hov/ever, will increase tension in the Far East.COMMONWEALTH VIEWS10. There is likely to be general Commonwealth agreementwith the view that the United Nations should continue to laymain emphasis on efforts to reach a negotiated settlement with china.      It is probable that while the Governments of Canada,Australia, New Zealand and South Africa may agree in general with the conclusions of the study of possible political andeconomic sanctions against China outlined in paragraphs 1+ to above, the imposition of even a selective embargo against Chinawill not be supported by the Asian members of the Commonwealth.ATTITUDE OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT TO UNITED NATIONS sanctions against CHINA11. Should the Good Offices Committee fail, the positionof the United Nations might be seriously undermined if nofurther steps were taken to meet Chinese aggression in Korea.But the conclusions to be drawn from the preceding paragraphsare that political sanctions might not only be unlikely to achieve their desired effect but might also be harmful.     Theyshould therefore be opposed.     As regards economic sanctions,the only measure which His Majesty1 s Government should, be pre-pared to support is a selective embargo on strategic materialsdesigned, to decrease China&apos;s war potential.     Under the present proposal for a selective embargo, no fresh action would becalled for by Hong Kong and Singapore.     But if significantleakages occurred through the two Colonies, it might benecessary to consider supplementary action (over and above theproposals considered by the Economic Policy Committee on 3rdApril).      Item (v) in the American list of possible sanctions,calling for an embargo on all materials useful for the produc-tion of the preceding four categories, is clearly objection-able, since differences of interpretation might well give riseto mutual recriminations amongst members of the United Nations.We shall therefore have to take this up with the State Depart-ment.
REOOMMENDATIONS12. I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that:-(i) His Ma;Jesty-fs Government should continue to laymain emphasis on efforts to reach a negotiated settlement with China.(ii)    In the course of the study being made by theAdditional Measures Committee, the United Kingdom Representa-tive should be authorised to express His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;sopposition to the imposition of any political sanctions againstChina and should make it clear that the only economic measure which his Government^could support in the event of the good offices Committee failing would be a selective embargo on strategic materials.(iii)   His Majesty&apos;s Government should attempt to ensurethat the Additional Measures.Committee should make no reportto the General Assembly until the Good Offices Committee failsand that the report itself should not go beyond recommending a selective embargo, together with any possible measuresspecifically and immediately related to the situation in Korea(e.g. additional assistance for United Nations forces fighting in Korea)..(iv)   The Governments of the Commonwealth, the UnitedStates and of Prance should be informed of these conclusions.H. M*Foreign Office, S.W.1,3RD APRIL, 1951-
annex a text of telegram Ho. 813 Saving of 17th February. 1951.from the Foreign Office to H. M. Embassy. WashingtonFollowing are conclusions of study on PoliticalSanctions.The tentative suggestions on political sanctions put to us in confidence by the Americans as a basis for discussion were as follows:-(a) countries which have not yet recognised PekingGovernment should refrain from doing so;(b) countries which have recognised but have not yetestablished diplomatic relations should refrain from sendingdiplomatic representatives to Peking; &apos;   &apos;(c) possible agreement that no Peking representatives should be allowed in the United Nations bodies until, forinstance, Chinese have ceased their aggression in Korea;(d) refusal to recognise any territorial gains whichhave resulted from aggressive activities of Peking Government.2. Our preliminary and general reaction is that sanctionsare primarily measures to compel or induce the offending partyto change its ways and. unless there is some reasonable prospectof their doing this, they would do more harm than good.      Ingeneral the proposals in paragraph 1 above seem to be littlemore than manifestations of moral disapproval which are notonly likely to be useless as sanctions but might be consideredsuperfluous in view of the expression of moral disapproval ofPeking aggression already conveyed in the condemnatoryResolution of 1st February.3. Our more detailed comments are as follows:(i)    (a) and (c) are in our view merely different aspectsof the same thing.     To support either of these courses would be inconsistent with the whole case we put forward in the CubanItem Debate, which is the basis of all our policy in this matteroIn our view recognition is recognition of a situation of factinvolving no moral approval of the Government concerned, norfor that matter any obligation to enter into relations with it,and ought not to be either granted or withheld on moral groundsonce the facts as to stability and control are establishedbeyond reasonable doubt. &apos;(ii)   On this view the United Nations and individual members have put themselves in the wrong by their persistent refusal:.sofar to recognise facts.     This has certainly added to diffi-culties which the United Nations have experienced in theirdealing with People&apos;s Government.     As regards (c), moral con-sideratiohs are additionally irrelevant since the Charter lays down that the State of China is a member of the United nations and a permanent member of the United Nations and a permanentmember of the Security Council.     The only relevant questiontherefore is, who in fact controls and represents China?     Forthe Chinese seat to be occupied by an entity which controls no part of China proper and can implement no decisions taken isnot only wrong in principle but also dangerous.
(iii)   Regarding (b), the breaking off of all diplomatic relations may properly be regarded as a sanction and is one ofthe measures specifically mentioned in Article 1+1 of the charter.     Whether merely refraining from establishing relationsthat are anyway non-existent will have any effect is doubtful.We are,&apos; in any event, opposed to whole idea of abandoning rela-tions with China since the only effect v/ould be to cut off theremaining channel (if the People&apos;s Government are also kept outof United Nations) through which they might be influenced andweaned away from Russia.(iv)    (d) appears to be a consequence rather than a sanction.Its deterrent effect would p&apos;robably be nil.     In our view, how-ever, it seems unobjectionable provided that it is understood as referring to de jure recognition.U. We doubt whether those who are in favour of sanctionshave really thought out their consequences to the end.     Itseems to us that none which have so far been suggested couldhonestly be said to do more harm to China than they would tothe democracies.5. Moreover in the long run United States attempts to mobilise all resources of United Nations and the specialised agencies for the purpose of taking punitive measures againstChina will only lead to more violent counter-action on the partof Soviet Union.     This will in its turn risk starting a pro-cess of disintegration of the United Nations and perhaps evenend in the complete withdrawal of the Russians and possiblyother (particularly Asian) members.6. Furthermore, to pursue the question of political and diplomatic sanctions at the United Nations would inevitablyaccentuate the divergencies of view in the democratic camp on some of the issues involved.     India and probably Pakistan would almost certainly resist all such sanctions and her lead mightwell be followed by quite a number of the Asian and arab countries.     This would clearly present us with a dangeroussplit on East/West lines, even assuming (and this seemsimprobable) that all the West European Governments who have recognised Peking were prepared to participate in some or all of these sanctions.7. Moreover, from the strictly practical point of view it is doubtful whether the application of political sanctions would produce any result that will not be achieved without them.The changeover in the Security Council and General Assembly isin any case unlikely to take place until the Central People&apos;sGovernment shows some genuine desire to achieve a peaceful settlement since few countries who have not already recognisedPeking will now do so unless the Central People&apos;s Governmentadopts a less intransigent attitude.     In these circumstances the injection of the issue of political sanctions into the pro-ceedings at Lake Success could only be directed to a furthermoral gesture and would place a serious strain on the demo-cratic camp without securing any real compensating advantage.Should China however extend her aggressive activities to Indo-China, Burma or Hong Kong, a new and even more dangerous situa-tion might then arise.     But in such a case greater unanimityof view and purpose would almost certainly be obtained and thewhole effect of political sanctions, unless they are to be no more than an entirely empty gesture, largely depends on whether an overwhelming majority of the free nations is prepared toapply them.     At this stage such a majority could in our viewnot be obtained, and to seek to do so would merelylead tounnecessary strains and dissension in the democratic camp.
Annex BText of telegram No. 81u Saving of 17th February. 1951from the Foreign Office to His Ma.1est.yfs EmbassyWashingtonFollowing are conclusions of Study on Economic Sanctionstoegether with political and strategic implications.Part I.   We have considered the following forms ofeconomic sanctions:-(a) Total embargo.(b) Selective embargo.(c) Shipping controls.(d) Naval blockade.(e) Financial controls.Total Embargo2.     By embargo we understand export prohibition imposedat the source by participating countries on goods destined for china.   We hope-that this idea will he discarded at the earliestpossible stage,   aven if all United Nations countries outsidethe Soviet bloc were to participate, we do not think that itwould he possible to achieve what we understand to be theobject of sanctions, namely, to induce the country against whichthey are directed to mend its ways.    China is not seriouslydependent on sea-borne imports, and though their denial might in the long term impede her general economic development, inthe short term we could not expect it to do more than createcertain difficulties for movement and supply of the Chinesearmed forces in the field; it would not alter the course of operations or deflect China from further acts of aggression.3.     The participation of all the United Nations countries outside the Soviet bloc is moreover an unrealistic hypothesis.India Burma and perhaps Pakistan would certainly abstain; andthey would presumably have little difficulty in aligning othercountries, e.g. the Asian and Arab group, against a-measurecalculated to strike indiscriminately at the war potentialand the civilian economy of China.   Thus, to press theproposal for a total embargo would intensify dissension inthe United Nations and might well cause a serious division between the four &quot;old&apos; and the Asian members of the Commonwealth.k*     Finally - an important consideration from our point ofview - a total embargo on exports to China might well be disastrous for Hong Kong.   Some i+5 per cent of the Colony1 sexports go to China.   The loss of this trade would causeunemployment and economic distress in the Colony and endangerits internal security, thus rendering it vulnerable to anattack which China, deprived of the benefits which she atpresent derives from trade with Hong Kong, might no longerhesitate to launch.Selective Embargo5.     It will be clear from the above that we do not regardeconomic sanctions as an effective instrument against China.We recognise, however, that it may not be possible to leavethe matter there, and we may eventually have to consider a form of selective embargo, which, while securing the short
term advantages of total embargo (i.e. the creation of difficulties for the movement and supply of Chinese armed forces), would not be so dangerous for Hong Kong, and would command a wider measure of support in the United Nations.The only form of embargo which would appear to sa&quot;tisfythese requirements is one based strictly on strategic considerations.    It would apply to a fairly short list of items selected from those categories of Chinese imports which are of direct importance to her war effort, e.g.metals and ores, machinery and tools, vehicles, chemicals and oil.   The object would be to limit the short termstriking power of the Chinese forces.6.     You will appreciate, though this is not a point which you would wish to stress with the Americans, that itemsselected for an embargo of this sort would be mostly coveredby the Paris Consultative Group&apos;s embargo list.   Thus,the effect of action by the United Nations would be limitedto closing to China and to China alone a few sources ofsupply outside the Paris Group, and t.o preventing leakagethrough trans-shipment from countries other than Russiaand her satellites which are not members of0the ParisConsultative Group.Ship-ping Controls7.     Shipping controls, which we consider should in any case be ancillary to trade controls, would not be effective without a wider measure of support from other members of theUnited Nations   than we think likely to be forthcoming.   Wecalculate that, even on the most favourable assumption regardingco-operation by other members, China would still be able tomake alternative arrangements for the necessary tonnage tocarry essential imports.   The British Merchant Fleet, the dutch and possibly others would be embarrassed by the probabledefection of Chinese seamen.   Attempts to fill their placesby Pakistanis or Indians might be made difficult.Naval Blockade8.     A naval blockade is the only sure way to make an embargo 1 total&apos; in the probable event of a number of countries not being willing to impose it by export controlat the source.   But we are strongly opposed to it.   Apartfrom the fact that it could not legally be enforced againstthe ships or goods of countries which did not agree to continue measures, it could be instituted only with difficultyso long as operations in Korea continue on their present scale, and the political objections are overwhelming.   Therewould be vehement opposition from India and other membersof the Asian group to such a provocative form of economic warfare; military counter-measures by the Chinese might wellprovoke general hostilities; and there is an obvious risk of incidents involving Soviet bloc shipping.   The main difficultyhowever is that apart from a decision of the Security Councilthere is no   way of binding members of the United Nations.   Underthe Uniting for Peace Resolution (and indeed under its inherentpowers also) the Assembly can only make recommendations whichare not binding.   A Resolution to embargo or blockade Chinawould not be binding on members of the Assembly who voted against it and could not legally be enforced against them by those who did.
16fiFinancial Controls9.     It would bo technically possible, though far fromsimple where Hong Kong is concerned, to use financial controlsto reinforce a total embargo, if this were thought desirable;but the status of sterling as an international currency wouldbe affected.   There would be little advantage in using financial controls to reinforce a selective embargo.PART II.    STRATEGIC AND POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF economic sanctions &apos;10.   We are not in a position to predict accurately how theCentral People&apos;s Government would react to the applicationof economic santions.   The possibility cannot be ruled out thatthey would retaliate not only by action in the economic sphere(where their scope is limited) but also by political and possiblymilitary measures.   Much would almost certainly depend on the severity of the sanctions imposed.   A complete embargo on all exports to China, backed by a naval blockade, would almost inevitably produce a much stronger reaction than the more limited proposal of a selective embargo.   A full naval blockade of the China coast (even if the legal difficulties of itsenforcement against non-participating countries could be gotround) would be regarded as an aggressive move against whichChina might almost certainly find it essential to retaliate(see 8 above); thereby involving most serious strategic andpolitical consequences,11.     A selective embargo would probably not result in immediate and serious repercussions, although the riskcannot be entirely excluded that even such a limited programmemight result in some or all of the consequences examined below,although probably in less drastic form.    On balance we considerthat a strictly limited and selective embargo might in thefirst instance be ignored by the Chinese as was the case whenthe export of strategic materials was first prohibited and what amounted to an embargo on oil was introduced.   The Chinesemight well take the line that they are not dependent on economic assistance from the West and that any such, attempts todislocate their economy must inevitably fail,12,     As regards the strategic implications of full economic sanctions, the Chiefs of Staff have reached the following conclusions:(a) Hopes of military co-operation against Communismby the Asian Commonwealth countries would recede.In the short term this would not prove to be muchof a disadvantage owing to the preoccupation ofIndia and Pakistan in .the, Kashmir dispute, butin the long term it may well prove;to be serious.(b) Differences between the United Kingdom and theUnited States over the degree and method of application of sanctions to be applied might resultin prejudicing their world-wide defence co-operation.
,(c)   The application of economic sanctions in their most rigorous form supported by a naval &quot;blockadewould do little damage in the near future to china^ war potential.   On the other hand, the repercussions might range from more increasedtension to an expansionist war by China in South-East Asia which might well lead in its turn togeneral war,(d) In the best case the actual institution of theblockade would not call for an increase in united nations forces.   In the worst case, however, Chineseovert aggression against Hong Kong, Indo-China, Burma,Siam and Malaya and attack on the forces institutingthe blockade would call for an increase in united nations forces which would prejudice our globalstrategy.(e) Russia and the Communist bloc in general would take every opportunity to increase our difficulties.If the United Nations becomes heavily embroiledin China as&quot;a result of economic sanctions Russia,may well take advantage of the situation to embarrass the Western Powers elsewhere.As regard the political implications of full economictions, we have reached the following conclusions:They would result in heightening international tension in the Par East and would reduce the prospects of an eventual negotiated settlement with China.India, Pakistan and a number of other Asian countries would not participate in economic sanctions and would almost certainl3r regard their enforcement as a dangerousstep towards war..The threat to Hong Kong and to Indo-China would be much increased.Inside China there would be increasing pressure to divert the energies of the Chinese revolution from apolicy of economic reconstruction to one of militaryexpansionism.China would increasingly fe$l compelled to cement,both politically and economxcally, her   alreadyclose alliance with the Soviet bloc.    (It is perhaps significant that on 5th February Pekingannounced the conclusion of economic and shippingagreements between China and Poland.)Drastic economic sanctions would provide China with considerable and effective &quot;anti-Imperialistpropaganda&quot;.
