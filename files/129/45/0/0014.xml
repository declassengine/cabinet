THIS  DOCUMENT  IS THE   PROPERTY   OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY^   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1951SECRET Copy No. 31CP. (51) 8919th March, 1951CABINETCONTROL OF GERMAN industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a report upon therecommendation, submitted to the Governments of the United Kingdom, Franceand the United States of America by the Inter-Governmental Study Group on Ger-many,* that the Prohibited and Limited Industries Agreement of 1949 should bereplaced by an Agreement concerning Industrial Controls. I propose to approve the recommendation on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government; and to authorise theUnited Kingdom Commissioner in Germany to sign it and bring it into force at anearly date.2. The contents of the new Agreement, and of certain agreed instructions uponthe administration of its provisions, are analysed in Section II of the Report. Therestrictions imposed by the Prohibited and Limited Industries Agreement have been modified to a lesser degree than the United Kingdom Delegation had been instructedto try to secure; and the outcome of the negotiations represents a marked concessionby the United Kingdom and United States Governments to the French point ofview. Nevertheless, I consider that it was realistic and timely to enter into the compromise embodied in the recommendation of the Study Group. It had beenabundantly demonstrated in the course of discussions stretching over six months,that the French Government could not be induced to accept a more liberal reyisionof existing controls; Although, too, German public opinion is unlikely to greet the outcome with enthusiasm, it was clearly wiser to agree that several helpful relaxation-tions should be put into force at once, rather than to risk a justifiably strongreaction in Federal Germany by continuing to pursue a more comprehensive but more elusive settlement.3. In Article I of the Agreement the signatory Governments have bound them-selves to review its provisions before the end of 1951. This agreed procedure should enable controls in the industrial field to be harmonised with developments in generalAllied policy towards the Federal Republic during that period. It should also serve to reconcile those elements which might otherwise make capital out of the degreeof discord between the Occupying Powers which could be read into the new Agree-ment; and to encourage those elements which are genuinely working in the common cause of integrating Federal Germany into the Western system.4. As recorded in paragraph 17 of the report, it is probable that the UnitedStates Government will, after accepting the recommendations of the Group andsigning the Agreement, express to the United Kingdom and French Governments,through the diplomatic channel, their views on the timing of further revision ofindustrial controls in Germany. The recipients would be under no obligation to answer such a communication; and the desirability of doing so would have to be assessed in the light of its contents. But if the American note raises controversialissues, I will consult my colleagues before replying. And, naturally, I should seektheir views upon the instructions to be given to the United Kingdom Delegationbefore any negotiations upon a revision of the Agreement were begun.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,\9th March, 1951.* The Group was set up by the Foreign Ministers of the Occupying Powers at their meeting in London in May 1950 and has been instructed to report on various German questions.40321 b
annex   -    \/. -      ., GERMAN INDUSTRIAL CONTROLSI. Work of the Study Group on the Revision of the Prohibited and limited Industries agreement on 19th September, 1950, in the course of the Foreign Ministers&apos; Conferencein New York, the then Secretary of State, with the prior approval of the Cabinet(CP. (50) 199 of 4th September; CM, (50) 56th Conclusions, Minute 6), joinedwith Mr. Acheson and M. Schuman in directing the Three-Power Study Group on germany to review the Agreement on Prohibited and Limited Industries, and tosubmit recommendations for its revision in accordance with the following principles:  (a) The elimination of restrictions which have proved to be unduly burdensomein administration....(b) The elimination of security restrictions, which, within the framework of thepresent relations between Germany and the Occupying Powers, appears,J.  ....... justified.    . ,. (c) The elimination of restrictions which would impede the common defence; programme of the West.2. As interim measures, the Foreign Ministers agreed to instruct the high commission:  &apos;(a) To inform the Federal Government that the High Commission, by unani-rhous agreement in consultation with the Military Security Board, isfree to permit steel production to rise, so that steel which may be exported or otherwise devoted to &quot;the defence effort of the West, willnot reduce the amount of steel available for German consumption.(b) To announce the removal of all restrictions on size, speed and number ofcommercial cargo ships for export, pending the study by the Inter-Governmental Study Group of the removal of similar restrictions onshipbuilding generally. ^&apos;; 3. Before the Study Group met, the instructions to the United kingdom delegation were considered and agreed inter-departmentally, and approved byMr. Bevin. The provisions of the Agreement had been inspired exclusively by considerations of security as assessed at the date (1948-49) when they werenegotiated; and were re-examined by Departments of His Majesty&apos;s government concerned in the light of subsequent changes in the international situation, withparticular reference to the development of the Soviet threat, and the creation of a democratic Federal Government in Western Germany.4. The instructions given to the United Kingdom Delegation reflected thegeneral conclusion of Departments that the transfer of the role of potentialaggressor from Germany to the Soviet Union, and the steadily developing policyof the Allied Powers of integrating Federal Germany in the Western system, would justify a substantial relaxation of restrictions imposed upon industries which are as important in time of peace as in time of war. It seemed prudent to them, however,not to enlarge the capacity of restricted German industries, whose product couldcontribute significantly to Soviet war potential in the event of an early occupationof Federal Germany by Russian Forces.5. - On this basis, it was decided that the following should be the objectives of the United Kingdom Delegation: -(a) The manufacture of pure war material should continue to be prohibited!-&apos;; If any specific items were required for Western rearmament, their production could be licensed by decision of the High Commission acting on instructions from the three Governments.;    (b) The limit upon the level of crude steel production (11-1 million tons perannum) should be removed, but no increase should be permitted in the capacity to produce crude steel in Federal Germany (estimated at about14 million tons per annum). &apos;      ;&quot;&apos;.&apos;&apos;
&apos; &apos; (c) Merchant ships might in future be built in Federal Germany, for retentionf&apos; or for export, without - limit of type, size or speed, provided her existingcapacity for shipbuilding (estimated at 280,000 tons per annum) were not- &apos; increased.   &apos;&apos;    id) The production of electronic valves should continue to be controlled.(e) All other limitations upon capacity or production should be removed, thus1 ,,. enabling Federal Germany freely to produce aluminium, synthetic1 ammonia, ball-bearings, chlorine, styrene, machine tools for civilian purposes, magnesium and synthetic oil and rubber.&apos; 6. The Study Group began work in London on 26th October. It soon became apparent that the position of the United States Delegation approximated on allmajor issues to that of the United Kingdom Delegation, but that the instructions of the French Delegation did not provide for any early or significant revision of theAgreement. The latter were clearly apprehensive of the repercussion of a relaxation of existing restrictions on German industry upon the outcome of the negotiations on the Schuman Plan, and the supply of German solid fuel to the French steelindustry. Deadlock was reached when the rrench Delegation adopted the stand-point that no consideration should be given to modifying the Agreement until thequestion of German rearmament had been decided; and had not been resolvedwhen the Study Group went into recess on 15th December.7. Mr. Bevin drew attention to the impasse in the course of the Conferenceat Brussels; and on 19th December the three Foreign Ministers agreed that the study Group should resume and complete its work on this and other tasks allotted to it.8. The Group reassembled on 30th January, 1951, and it at once emergedthat the positions of two Delegations in relation to the future of the Agreement had altered. The instructions of the United Kingdom Delegation were unchanged. TheFrench Delegation claimed that they were ready to discuss the revision of theAgreement as a whole provided: -(a) It was understood that they were unwilling to consider changes in the permitted level of German steel production until an acceptable solutionhad been found for the problem of the allocation of German solid fuel.(b) The High Commission should decide the date at which any agreed relaxation-tion should come into force; and should use their discretion in thisrespect as a bargaining point in their negotiations with the Germansupon a Defence contribution, and other subjects of interest to the occupying Powers.9. This limited disposition on the part of the French Delegation to make progress was extinguished, however, when the United States Delegation declaredthat the passage of time and the requirements of Atlantic Defence and WesternIntegration called for the immediate removal of restrictions from all sections ofGerman industry, with the exception of the limited field prescribed in the approvedreport of the Military Committee of the N.A.T.O., which the Americans summarisedas &quot; armaments, aircraft and atoms.&quot; Untempted by a supplementary offer to postpone the application of this sweeping policy to the German steel industry untilthe fate of the Schuman Plan had been decided, the French Delegation retreatedto the position that no substantial revision of the Agreement could be contemplateduntil Federal Germany&apos;s contribution to Western Defence had been agreed.10. In the course of the ensuing discussions, the United Kingdom Delegationtried to effect a compromise between these extremes with a proposal that the group should consider a revision of the Agreement to be brought into force in two phases.In the first phase, which would coincide with the present, such restrictions shouldbe removed as the application of the New York principles would justify. Theproposals made by the United Kingdom Delegation in the 1950 Session (para-graph 5 above) would constitute an appropriate content for Phase One, whichwould last until agreement had been reached upon a German contribution to defence. At that point, Phase Two would begin. The relaxations to be made ineach phase should be recommended by the Study Group in the course of thecurrent review. If the work were done now, a proper balance could- be achievedbetween the two phases; subsequent negotiation would be unnecessary; and the occupying Powers would have planned another advance in their policy towards germany, in the light of which the resulting reduction in the staff of the high commission could be effected equitably and economically.40321 b 2
4; 11. The United States Delegation were prepared to proceed in the manner proposed, although they reserved their decision upon acceptance of the planpending agreement upon the relaxations to be made in Phase Two. The french delegation, however, rejected the proposal on the grounds that relaxations approp-riate to Phase Two could not be devised until the terms of Germany&apos;s contributionto Defence, and the circumstances attendant upon it, were known. After furtherprolonged and abortive discussions, the French Delegation, under Anglo-Americanpressure, were authorised to re-examine the Agreement with a view to establishingwhat modifications could, in the view of all three Delegations, be put into effect at an. early date, and in advance of the determination of Germany&apos;s denfence contribution. Re-examination resulted in a series of agreed recommendations which were submitted to the three Governments on 16th March. &apos;&apos;II.-Agreement concerning Industrial Controls12. The approved recommendations of the Study Group comprise the text of an Agreement concerning Industrial Controls, which replaces the Prohibitedand Limited Industries Agreement, and a series of confidential agreed instructionsto the High Commission on the administration of certain of its provisions. Copiesof both documents are annexed to this memorandum. The effect of the new agreement, taken in conjunction with the administrative instructions, are analysedin paragraphs 13 to 15 below.13. (a) Steel. The limit on the production of crude steel of 111 million tons per annum, imposed by the old Agreement, has been maintained in thenew, with the proviso that the High Commission may authorise produc-tion in excess of this limit of steel needed for Western Defence. The&quot; interim &quot; decision taken at New York (paragraph 2 above) has thusbeen incorporated in the Agreement, as a result of failure to agree upon any alternative. In theory, steel could, under this provision, beproduced up to the level of existing capacity (about 14 million tons perannum) provided enough approved orders were received, and the high commission agreed that they should be met. But the existing capacitymay not be exceeded. Capacity for the production of electric arc and high frequency furnace steel will also be controlled, although the high commission has been instructed to consider whether the needs of western Defence would justify art increase in this class of capacity.A number of categories of steel finishing equipment will continue to belimited as at present.. (b) Merchant Ships--The capacity to build merchant ships will be limitedto that at present existing in Federal Germany. Federal Germany maybuild&apos;for export, or build, or otherwise acquire for her own operation,merchant ships without limit of type, speed or tonnage. These shipsmay not possess certain &quot; prohibited features &quot; which would enablethem to play an offensive part in war; but some of the more &quot; defensive &quot;of these &quot; features &quot; may, under licence from the High Commission,be&apos;incorporated in ships-built in German yards to the order of countriesmembers of the N.A.T.O., or other approved countries.(c) Synthetic Rubber and Oil produced from Coal. The prohibition upon theproduction of these materials is removed, but existing capacity toproduce them may not be increased.  In practice the rehabilitation ofall these plants, which in some measure depends upon the installation- of new equipment, will not be permitted so long as the diversion tothem of German solid fuel would reduce the quantity available forexport to countries who import it.id) Electronic Valves. Control of production will continue to be exercised,but in a modified form.(e) Ball and Roller Bearings. Control will be retained over the capacity ofthis industry, but its scope will be restricted to precision bearings.Permitted capacity will also be increased by the re-installation of someOf the equipment of the plant, at Kugelfisher.   Production within1   &apos; permitted capacity will be unrestricted.&apos; &apos;(f) Primary Aluminium, Synthetic Ammonia, Chlorine, Styrene, and machine tools for Civilian Purposes. No restriction will be imposed uponproduction, Or capacity to produce, in these industries.  A system of
reporting will be introduced by administrative action in respect of someclasses of machine tool, with a view to checking their unauthorisedexport to the East.14. The new Agreement, like the old, prohibits the production in FederalGermany, save under licence from the High Commission, of all forms of warmaterial. The terminology of the list of prohibited commodities has been revised and clarified, but its substance remains unchanged. Agreed instructions in thefollowing sense have been prepared for the guidance of the High Commission inthe exercise of the licensing power:  (a) The High Commission shall not permit, unless and until the Governmentsconcerned otherwise decide, the manufacture in Germany of the items which, in accordance with the approved recommendations of theMilitary Committee of the N.A.T.O., should continue to be prohibitedeven .after Germany&apos;s defence contribution has been decided. they shall continue, unless and until the Occupying Powers decide otherwise,to apply existing prohibitions on &quot; materials, facilities and equipmentrelating to atomic energy.&quot;(b) Licences may be granted at the discretion of the High Commission for a specified range of minor items ordered by N.A.T.O. countries, providedthat their production does not entail the use of equipment specially designed for manufacture of munitions of war. Similar orders from non-* N.A.T.O. countries may also be authorised with the prior approval ofthe three Governments.(c) Pending agreement upon some alternative procedure, articles comprised inthe Prohibited List and unaffected by the instructions described at (a)and (b) above, may be licensed for manufacture to the order of countriesmembers of the N.A.T.O., or other approved countries, provided that each order is considered and approved in advance by the three Govern-ments. This arrangement will be reviewed as soon as agreement isreached upon a German contribution to Defence.15. The instructions to the High Commission also prescribe general rules forthe administration of controls over German industrial capacity, which, in the caseof the steel and merchant shipbuilding industries, is defined in detail.III. Future of Security Controls over German Industry16. The three Governments have bound themselves by Article I of the new agreement to review its provisions at a date not later than the last day of 1951. Itcan be reviewed earlier at the request of two of the signatories. This Articlereflects the general sense of the three Delegations that the maintenance of allied control over German industry must be closely related to the development of thepolicy of the Occupying Powers towards Federal Republic in the political field.17. The United States Government, in particular, may be expected to embracethe first opportunity for reviewing the new Agreement. It is clear that the UnitedStates Delegation are deeply concerned and dissatisfied at what they regard as themeagre outcome of six months of negotiation. They have intimated that, once theAgreement has been signed, the United States Government will address to HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the French Government, through the diplomatic channel,a note rehearsing their conviction that it is inconsistent with the agreed decisions ofthe Brussels Conference to maintain restrictions upon any sections of german industry save those named in the report of the Military Committee of N.A.T.O.and one or two others, e.g., civil aircraft. It is probable, too, that in any note ofthis nature, the United States Government would reiterate their desire to remove from the German steel industry all restrictions maintained upon it by the new agreement, as soon as this can be done without prejudice to the adoption of the schuman Plan. (There is some indication that the French Government would beprepared to concur in the removal of these restrictions as soon as the Schuman plan had been ratified by participating Governments.) Recipient Governments wouldbe under no obligation to reply to this Note: and the advisability of doing so couldbe decided only in the light of its contents.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,March 1951.

Prohibited items in determining the exceptions which may be authorised to the prohibitions setdown in Article II in respect of the items listed in Annex A to the Agreement, theHigh Commission should be guided by the following considerations:  1. The Foreign Ministers in Brussels approved recommendations of theMilitary Committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to the effect thatthe manufacture of certain items shall not be permitted in Germany. Unless anduntil the Governments concerned decide otherwise, the High. Commission shallnot authorise the manufacture of any of these items in or of  ny specialisedproductive, testing or training equipment associated with the development, produc-tion or use of these items. -Materials, products, facilities: and equipment relatingto atomic energy shall continue to be subject to Allied High Commission legislation.2.

Unless agreement is reached on some other procedure, any bona fide orders from North Atlantic Treaty countries or other countries for items listed m Ann^x A,not subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 above, shall be promptlyreferred to the three Governments for appropriate ad hoc decision as to whetherthe items in question may be produced in Germany. As soon as a German contri-bution to defence is agreed these arrangements shall be reviewed. Present practicewith regard to the manufacture of prohibited items for approved domestic needs and export is not affected by these instructions.4. White phosphorous has been retained in Group VIII of Annex A on theunderstanding that the construction of capacity may be licenced and productionpermitted for legitimate peace-time purposes under existing. High Commissionlegislation. The High Commission should ensure that applications to erect capacity which is not unreasonably out of proportion to estimated requirements are favour-ably considered and promptly dealt with.B. Electronic valvesThe administration of Article IV of the Agreement shall be governed by thefollowing: -1. The list of permitted types of valves shall be revised by the high commission as rapidly as possible and shall be kept current by addenda as required.A valve shall be considered eligible for inclusion in this list: -(a) If it has a rated anode dissipation of 50 watts or less, determined accordingto any recognised standard or method acceptable to the High Cornmis-sion; and, : &apos;(b) if at frequencies of 250 megacycles or higher, under commercial operationalconditions, it does not have an output/input power ratio greater than50 per cent, of its maximum rated output/input power ratio at ordinaryfrequencies.2. Applications for licence to manufacture valves not included in either the permitted :or the prohibited list shall be considered on their merits,,due to considera-tion being given to the peacetime uses for the valve as presented by the application.Licences will normally, be granted against such applications unless there is ,reasonto believe that the valves are to be used to fulfil an unauthorised militaryrequirement.3. As the provisions of Article IV of the Agreement involve a departure from the present methods of control of electronic valves, the High commission should direct that a review of the provisions of this Article be undertakeh within three months from the date when this Agreement becomes operative in. Germany.;    C. Control of capacity &apos; .In maintaining control over capacity under Article V^of the Agreement theHigh Commission shall be guided by the following instructions^,-^,,,&quot;71. General instructions - ,   1 t        &apos;- (a) The industrial capacities over 1 which control is maintained in this Agree-rhent shall not be increased except as may be agreed among^GovernmentS; or as provided below. .,.;.: &apos;...       &quot;. i:v&apos;.;&apos;^&apos;: ,      ; .... &quot;-^ &quot; *&quot;*. vr$). T^should not hamper technological progress or1 the modernisatiOn-of; prM&amp;^i6h,T;Sttd
should permit wherever possible the reduction of costs and the decreased consump-tion of raw materials, power and fuel. To this end the High Commission should,in the absence of weighty security considerations to the contrary, permit the sub-stitution of new or more efficient equipment, the rearrangement of machinery, theintroduction of new processes and other technical changes even though,1 taking account of the disposal of capacity replaced they may involve a minor increasein the capacity of the factory or equipment in question.(c) In applying the provisions of paragraph (a) above, capacity shall be calcu-lated in each case on the basis of the capacity the retention of which in germany the Occupying Powers do not disapprove, to the exclusion of equipment availablefor reparations in accordance with the agreements entered into by the three governments.2. Instructions on individual industries-(a) Steel. The plant and equipment over which control is to be maintained in accordance with paragraph 1 (a) above shall be: (i) Blast furnaces.(ii) Converters and furnaces for the production of crude steel.(iii) Equipment for the production of ferro alloys.(iv) Equipment for the manufacture of seamless tubes of a size greater than90 millimetres diameter.(v) Plate mills over three metres wide and all rolling mills capable of rolling,on a two-shift basis, more than 400,000 tons per annum.(vi) Forging presses over 2,000 metric tons.Henceforward the plants and equipment removed from the reparations listUnder the terms of paragraph VII (b) of the Petersberg Protocol of Agreementsdated 22nd November, 1949, shall only be subject to the same controls as are applicable to other steel plants in Germany. ^(b) Electric arc and high-frequency furnace steel. The High commission should study, as a matter of urgency, the limitation on electric arc and high-frequency furnace steel capacity and should report to Governments whether any changes should be made in the light of the needs of Western defence.(c) Shipbuilding. (i) The equipment and facilities over which control is tobe maintained in accordance with paragraph 1 (a) above shall be:  (aa) Launching slipways.(bb) Quays and wharfs.(cc) Shipyard workshops, including essential equipment.(dd) Floating docks, floating dock pontoons and graving docks.(ee) Ship-repairing slipways.(ii) The prefabrication of hull sub-assemblies of vessels shall continue to be prohibited except in the shipyard in which such vessels are to be built or exceptpursuant to licence issued by the Military Security Board. This provision shall not preclude the procurement from any source other than the shipyard in which theship is to be built of stern frames, rudder posts and other equipment which maynormally be obtained from any such source.(iii) In defining the essential equipment of shipyard workshops referred toin (i) (cc) above, the Military Security Board should be instructed to draw up asshort a list as possible covering only those items of equipment which, if installed,would be capable of leading to a substantial increase in the output of the workshop.(iv) The A.G. Weser (Deschimag) Shipyard, Bremen, henceforward will be permitted to construct ships and will only be subject to the same restrictions as are applicable to other shipyards in Germany.(d) Synthetic rubberThe High Commission may authorise the rehabilitation of plants, including the installation of new equipment, and the utilisation of new processes. However, aslong as solid fuels are in short supply the High Commission may grant licences Onlyto the extent that the additional consumption of cOal and coke necessary, for theproduction contemplated does not affect the satisfaction of the needs of the solidfuel-importing countries.
(e) Synthetic petrol, oil and lubricants, produced directly or indirectly from coal or&apos;       brown coal    &quot;&apos;&apos;r.    *       &apos;       , y-.     .--i r-:.&apos;.&apos; -As regards synthetic oil, additions to capacity of equipment primarily designed for manufacture, of synthetic oil and the use of existing capacity shall be subject tolicence. As long as solid fuels are in short supply the High Commission may grantlicences only to the extent.that the additional cpnsumptic^;bf cckl and cokenecessary for the production contemplated does not affect the satisfaction of theneeds- of the solid fuel-importing countries. However the three Governmentsinterpose no objection to the granting of the applications outstanding for the useof, the Bergkamen, Viktor, Scholven and Ruhroel plants as soon as this agreement is concluded. &apos;y!yD. Shipping ,1. The High Commission may henceforward authorise the inclusion inmerchant ships ordered by NATO countries] or, with the approval of the three governments, by other countries, of defensive features; and necessary space and facilities therefore, which are otherwise prohibited under Article VII of, the Agree-ment.   These shall include but not be limited to the following:-(i) Stiffening in readiness, for the mounting of defensive armament.(ii) Measures to reduce the vulnerability of the ship to underwater damage which would normally be experienced only in wartime&apos; (e.g., by the upward extension of bulkheads in the shelter deck type of ship).(iii) Measures to protect key positions against damage which would normally be experienced only in wartime (e.g., protection of the bridge);(iv) Provision for adequate clear space in the super-structure of the ship toallow for the operation of the armament.(v) Auxiliary electrical; generating machinery and equipment of capacity inexcess of that normal to the type of ship.(vi) Degaussing cable (M. coils).E.-Machine Tools1. The prohibition on the manufacture except under licence of the machine tools listed in Annex B to the Agreement concerning Prohibited and LimitedIndustries of April 1949 is not maintained in the present Agreement, but the high commission^ attention is drawn to the significance of these machines as war potential. A system of declaration of manufacture by the producer, in which the intended destination will be given, and of periodical reports on the quantities of suchmachines in Germany shall be set up, or if already in existence, maintained.2. For this purpose, a list is attached showing the tools on which reports should be required.3. The attention of the High Commission is drawn to the desirability of con-tinuing to use the services of the Military Security Board in connection with the effective control of the export of such machine tools to countries in the East4. As the new Agreement does, not refer to machine tools, it is suggested thatthe High Commission may wish to make a public announcement concerning thereporting requirements.List of Machine Tools on which Reports should be required1.
