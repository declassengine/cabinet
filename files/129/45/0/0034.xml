THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  A pril 1951SECRET Copy No.CP. (51) 109\6th April, 1951&apos;      CABINETVISIT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR commonwealth relations TO THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA, SOUTHERNRHODESIA AND THE THREE HIGH COMMISSION territories of BASUTOLAND, THE BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE ANDSWAZILANDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations am circulating this report for the information of my colleagues. I am afraidit is long, but I visited three different and difficult areas. I have sub-divided thereport as follows:  (i) Southern Rhodesia (paragraphs 3 to 11).(ii) High Commission Territories (paragraphs 12 to 21).(iii) Union of South Africa (paragraphs 22 to 34).(iv) Problems of Policy (paragraphs 35 to 55).Some of my colleagues may prefer to read only the conclusions I have formed.These are in section (iv).2. I spent six weeks in January and February this year travelling in the Unionof South Africa and Southern Rhodesia as the guest of the two Governments andin the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland and Swaziland. In that time Itravelled by air, road and rail some 17,000 miles.(i) Southern Rhodesia3. Southern Rhodesia is still in many ways like an enlarged County Council.Its white population is 129,000. The general level of Ministers and Civil servants and business men is not high: but there are a few outstanding exceptions in allthese classes. Trade Union and Labour leaders are not impressive. The LabourParty is small and split. The Trade Unions are extremely colour-conscious andenforce a rigid colour bar in the fields they control (particularly housing). Theyseek to exclude Africans from all skilled and semi-skilled building labour (and indeed from what we would here classify as unskilled labour) in the towns. Throughtraining schools, African builders are becoming quite good though they cannot yet,in any numbers, work as well as the whites and they lack persistence. Nevertheless,I saw some excellent African-built houses, schools and hospitals. Their cost isabout half as much as similar buildings put up by European labour. With theexception of the small Labour element the whole of Southern Rhodesia seems tobe pro-Churchill and conservative in British politics, in which they are veryinterested. Even many of the Labour people think the British Labour Party hasinnocent and Utopian ideas about race-relations. In their own internal affairs theyare, however, quite radical and readily create State industries in fields such as ironand steel and railways in which they think we are stupid to have done so.4. In general Southern Rhodesia is a happy and prosperous country. It has very considerable resources (doubtless much more than have yet been discovered).The population is pretty vigorous and virile. The country is suffering now from the40458 b
effects of unco-ordinated development and lack of foresight: for example, therailways were long neglected and are now inadequate to the economy; too manyunimportant secondary industries were started; the immense coal resources atWankie were slackly developed. All these things have been realised and are howbeing taken in hand. There is a tremendous housing shortage both for europeans and Africans, aggravated by the colour bar in the building industry. Some ingeniousexperiments are being made with new building materials. As far as I could judgehouses cost about twice what they would in England. On the average, generalprices seemed about the same as in England. -5. One of Southern Rhodesia&apos;s main problems is white population. If theybuild this up fast it imposes a great strain on their resources: but if they do not,,their potential resources cannot be developed. In recent years they have somewhatrestricted immigration by insisting upon a high standard of quality and upondeposits by each immigrant. At the current rate South African immigrantsoutnumber British immigrants by 2 to 1. This is much discussed and argued aboutin Southern Rhodesia. It is hard to analyse the motives behind the immigration from the Union and there are no figures about its make-up. A fair proportion are british South Africans and not Afrikaners. Some of these and some of theAfrikaners, too, are leaving a country whose policy and Government they do not like. Not every Afrikaner by any means is a bad immigrant; indeed, the loyalAfrikaner who accepts King and Commonwealth is an admirable citizen. Most ofthese immigrants probably came in for simple economic reasons. Land is relativelyCheap and tobacco is a quickly profitable crop; farmers and employers find it muchcheaper to bring in a man from the Union than from the United Kingdom; alsomuch easier to send him back if he is unsuitable. Many who come to work for others soon settle down on their own. There is, however, an element in thisimmigration (no one can say how large) that is political; various organisations inthe Union deliberately foster immigration in order to bring Southern Rhodesiaincreasingly within South Africa&apos;s sphere of influence.6. Sir Godfrey Huggins, the Prime Minister, spoke to me about this. Hesaid that he had resolved to tackle the matter radically. He wanted to allowunrestricted immigration from Britain (with an assisted passage scheme) and toimpose quotas on all other countries (in fact South Africa). He had not yet put this to his own party-but would soon do so. If he does bring this forward it will cause great controversy in Southern Rhodesia. I myself met many different viewson. this matter. It will certainly greatly annoy South Africa. Huggins had got the agreement of his Cabinet to his policy.7. As far as I could in the time I went into the question of native policy in southern Rhodesia. 1 saw Native Reserves and many schools, hospitals and housing schemes for Africans. I also discussed the question with all sorts of people. There is certainly a genuine distinction between the native policy ofSouthern Rhodesia and the Union. There is nothing in Southern Rhodesia to compare with the racial hatred and tension in places like Johannesburg in theUnion. There have been some strikes by African workers but these have beenpurely economic and conducted in an orderly way. As in the Union, a good dealof money (almost all raised by taxes on the whites) is spent on African education,health and housing. All the officials I met concerned with these things impressedme. African food production in the Reserves and from farms and market gardensis relatively much higher than in the Union and makes an important contributionto the country&apos;s food supply.Southern Rhodesia has largely been able to avoid the urban native problemthat has arisen in towns like Johannesburg in the Union and steps are being takento prevent it by building separate African townships that will have complete localself-government.8. The Southern Rhodesian Government and its officials are well ahead ofpublic opinion. Although one can meet people whose views are indistinguishablefrom the Nationalists in South Africa, they are not dominant. The general attitude,I think, is one of kindly superiority the Africans must be helped but must keepin their places. There is a vague but widespread apprehension about the futurewhen there will be increasingly large numbers of educated and trained Africans.At the moment, the vast majority of Africans are primitive and illiterate and riddenwith superstition. Only a very small number is educated or politically conscious.Only some 30 per cent, attend even primary schools. About 4,000 were qualified
for the electoral roll before the qualifications were recently raised. The Govern-ment, under Huggins, has steadily pressed for, and often secured, better treatment for the Africans than they would otherwise have got. For example, the Governmentis overcoming the resistance of towns (and Trade Unions) against African driversarid conductors for buses. The Government would like to break down or weaken the ban on African building workers. Against a good deal of criticism a maternityhome for Africans was opened recently in Salisbury that is more modern and betterthan the home for Europeans and this at a time when the European maternity homeis greatly overcrowded. Huggins is thinking of starting a University for Africansbefore one for Europeans. Of course, the social provision for Europeans is beyondcomparison better than for Africans; I doubt if any Government has a better recordin the provision of schools including many State-financed boarding schools.9. The most debatable question concerns the franchise. There is a commonelectoral roll Open to all who meet certain qualifications. These qualifications haverecently been raised, the property qualification from  150 to  500 and the annual income qualification from  100 to , 240. There is also a simple English languagetest. This will undoubtedly postpone the day when Africans can play a significantpart in elections and still further the day when any of them can hope to be elected to Parliament. On the other hand, only 800 out of the 4,000 already qualifiedever actually put themselves on the roll. Moreover, the English language testwill exclude a number of undesirable Afrikaners. The qualifications have been fairly administered and Europeans are excluded.as well as Africans. Huggins had considerable difficulty in resisting pressure to exclude Africans altogether. He haspreserved the essential principle of a single electorate and avoided the blind-alleyof separate communal electorates. Constituencies, though immense in area, have very small electorates, and if Africans show a greater keenness to get on to theroll they should in less than a decade be able to play an important part in someconstituencies. In about 25 years there should be African M.Ps.r 10. The gravest Southern Rhodesian problem concerns the pull towards SouthAfrica. This problem is as old as Southern Rhodesia itself: when in 1922 therewas a plebiscite on whether Southern Rhodesia should join the Union Or become an independent self-governing colony the voting was no more than 8 to 5 infavour of independence.I discussed this question with a number of leading people and was surprised tofind how considerable is still the readiness and desire to join the Union. Thosewho hold this view have many and mixed motives. Some want it for economic reasons; some to strengthen the pro-British element in South Africa; some outof genuine approval of the Union; some from dislike of what nearly everyonein Southern Rhodesia calls &quot; Colonial Office policy.&quot; Perhaps as many as a thirdwOuld vote for incorporation to-day. Rut the two-thirds on the other side wouldbe very determined and adamant. The general sentiment in Southern Rhodesiais very powerfully in favour of the British connexion. There is no immediatedanger of any change of loyalty. Present policies in the Union have weakenedwhat feeling there is in favour of incorporation.- . 11. Sir Godfrey Huggins is outstandingly the ablest man in SouthernRhodesia and it is hard to see who can take over when he goes. The second manin the Cabinet is Davenport, Minister of Mines, Transport and Education, who issolid and reasonable, but lacking in personality.&apos; Whitehead, the Minister ofFinance, is the cleverest member of the Government, but he is deaf and half-blindand an aloof man, not at all popular. Nor is his political judgment sound. Thebest man after Huggins is, I think, Greenfield, the Minister of Internal Affairs and justice. He is new in the Government and will need some years to develop.(Incidentally he told me that he had always been in favour of the incorporation of Southern Rhodesia in the Union and had only changed when Malan had comeinto power.)(ii) High Commission Territories12. I was greatly impressed by what I saw of developments in our three high commission Territories.: the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland and Swazi-land. TheJJigh Commissioner, Sir Evelyn Baring, has in his seven years of officedone a magnificent job. In the past these Territories were sadly neglected on theground that it was not worth spending money on Territories that would one daygo to the Union. From all accounts relations between the Africans, the Europeans40458 - b 2
and the Administration were all bad. To-day they are all pretty good. The loyaltyof the Africans is very high. They are overwhelming against incorporation andcling to their allegiance to The King, as they pointed out in every single publicspeech they made to me. The only exceptions are a very few Africans in posts inwhich they would be paid at a higher salary in the Union. Salaries are commonlyhigher in the Union, but this consideration influences only a handful of people.I think the great majority of the Europeans are also against transfer.13. The change in the temper of these Territories is partly due to the direct interest taken in them by the High Commissioner, who has frequently visited them,understands their problems, and personally knows many Africans and Europeans.It is essential that future High Commissioners should take the same interest. It isalso desirable that the Secretary of State should sometimes visit the Territories.The population is inclined to feel isolated and ignored, and much appreciates anyconcern shown by His Majesty&apos;s Government. A firm attitude on transfer to theUnion has also raised the morale of the Territories.14. Another main cause of the general good feeling lies in the recent plans for economic development. About  1 million is being spent on each of the three territories out of the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund. This is beingspent in the main on raising the basic wealth of the Territories (e.g., on water supplies and anti-soil-erosion work). At the same time the Colonial development corporation has undertaken some very important projects. In Swaziland there isa big afforestation scheme that should yield considerable dividends in 12 to 15 years.Previous experience in afforestation makes this project a very safe investment. TheCorporation is also developing a big irrigated farming project pioneered by privateenterprise in the north of Swaziland. In Bechuanaland there are two schemes one for mixed farming and cattle-raising in the North; one for an abbatoir in theSouth. The. abbatoir seems very sound economically, as it will enable stock tobe killed at its prime and sent to market in South Africa where it can fetch goodprices; there should be a sufficient through-put of cattle to sustain it comfortably.The other scheme in the North seems sound, but I am looking into it again in orderto be as sure as one can. By these means the Government revenue in each territory should steadily increase and permit schools, hospitals, &amp;c, not only to be startedbut to be adequately sustained,15. The High Commissioner^ aim, with which I wholly agree, is to find ineach Territory some new major economic resource and develop it so that each territory may become largely self-sustaining and much less dependent upon send-ing workers to the South African gold mines. In Bechuanaland (ranching) andSwaziland (timber) this policy is being carried out. But in Basutoland there is no corresponding potential resource. The only hope here is to dam the source of the orange river, build subsidiary hydro-electric dams and sell water and power to theUnion.This would be a costh/ undertaking, and it might arouse political difficulties as it concerns the headwater of one of the main South African rivers. It wouldenable the Orange river to be made silt-free and would remove one of the Union&apos;sbest arguments for the incorporation of Basutoland. (This project which has been carefully explored and checked is still confidential, the Union Government isaware of the investigation, but the timing and handling of any official approach tothem will be a delicate question.)16. The major immediate problem in Basutoland and Swaziland is soil-erosion.Excellent work is being done by our officials. But only if this work is stuck toand pushed ahead, with adequate funds, can soil-erosion be conquered. If it isnot, the two Territories will be economically ruined Successful anti-erosion workdepends upon the goodwill of the Chiefs and headmen: the whole work can goto pieces unless a large number of minor infringements of the law are promptlypunished (e.g., breaking down a contour furrow or ploughing in a grass-strip).Only the Native Courts can look after this. Their powers are being steadilyincreased, and African co-operation in this work is steadily improving. The most difficult task still lies ahead, which is to persuade the people to de-stock. Every-where there is serious over-grazing which kills out the grass by preventing re-seed-ing. It is hard to persuade these Africans, who regard cattle as wealth, that theirwealth will increase by reducing their stock. It is like persuading our people ofthe benefit to themselves of a wage and dividend freeze.17. The immediate problem in Bechuanaland (besides de-stocking) is theprovision of water both by surface dams and bore-holes.  The head of cattle that
can be carried is a direct function of the wateravailable. Moreover, the railwayithat runs through this Territory and provides most,of its revenue must haveincreased water-supplies if it is to carry increased traffic. Unless this is done thereis danger of an alternative line being built outside the Territory. For political reasons South Africa is pressing such a project. This would pretty well ruinBechuanaland. Improving water-supplies is an expensive undertaking in itself and there seems to be no certain way of ensuring that every bore-hole will in facttap water.Ultimately Bechuanaland may become extremely prosperous cattle-country.Apart from the Colonial Development Corporation project, large parts of theKalahari desert have underground water; but to develop this desert^ roads and railways would have to be built. *.&apos;There seems to be no prospect of any of this Bechuanaland meat coming to britain. The demand for meat in Africa is rapidly mounting. Indeed, a meatshortage (and general food shortage) is one of Africa&apos;s most pressing problems.18. I do not deal in this section of my report with the problem of how wecan keep the Territories out of the Union (that problem can only be properlyconsidered in relation to the Union). But, if we are to keep these Territories, wemust be prepared to put money into them. One of South Africa&apos;s best arguments for incorporation has been their general backwardness. The three Territories areshop-windows in the.midst of the Union and we must keep them economicallystrong and progressive. We cannot hope to spend as much on them as SouthAfrica spends on her corresponding Native Reserves nor is this necessary in orderto hold their loyalty. Their African inhabitants feel themselves to be free men,and they rate this above mere material prosperity. Nevertheless, we must develop the Territories if we are to hold them. They must get at least their fair share of whatever money we are putting into our Colonies. The decision to hold the Terri-tories is a political decision which cannot possibly pay us economically. We must therefore be ready to face the economic consequence of our political decision.19. I gave special attention in the Bechuanaland Protectorate to the Bamang-wato tribe (from which Seretse and Tshekedi come). I attended a Kgotla that was said to be the biggest to assemble for the conduct of business. A Kgotla istheoretically the assembly of the whole tribe: every male inhabitant is entitled toattend. In fact, some .10,000 attended, most of them coming in lorries from outlyingdistricts. All this occurred during the ploughing season-which is the one timewhen the men (as distinct from the women) work and when they all want to be inthe fields. &apos;The Kgotla was. a friendly one and I was greeted in an enthusiastic way on my arrival and before it could be known what I was to say. Before I spoke therewas one main speech and nine subsidiary speeches all on the same theme-andall in a broiling sun. They wanted Seretse back: above all they wanted tshekedi and all his followers excluded for ever from the Territory. There was, of course,some organisation and rehearsal behind all this but it is quite impossible to stagea Kgotla of 10,000. Moreover, each of the nine subsidiary speakers came fromone of the &quot; allied &quot; or &quot; subject&quot; peoples who are ruled over by the Bamangwatoand whom Tshekedi had claimed were on his side.I had already discussed the whole situation with the first-rate officials who arenow in charge. They had produced overwhelming evidence of Tshekedi&apos;s extremeunpopularity. This seems to rest partly on the feeling that he is seeking to usurpthe Chieftainship to which he is not lineally entitled; but mainly on sheer fear.He is an extremely able, ruthless and unforgiving man, and everyone is frightenedthat if he comes back into the Reserve in any capacity he will get back to powerand revenge himself on all who have either supported Seretse or failed to supportTshekedi.I am quite convinced that the tribe cannot settle down nor can the newlyinstituted system of councils be got to work until the Bamangwato are convincedthat Tshekedi will not be allowed to return to the Tribal Reserve. Once this ismade clear the tribe will settle down and will begin to make up its mind aboutSeretse. (It was significant that the desire to exclude Tshekedi was even more strongly expressed than the desire to have Seretse back, and that not a singlemention was made at any time Of Ruth.)In these circumstances I made a speech to the Kgotla saying that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment adhered to the White. Paper policy (under which both Seretse andTshekedi are excluded); that we would reconsider the matter in about five years;
that this did not necessarily mean that Seretse would then return; and that neitherTshekedi nor anyone else would ever be imposed as Chief against the will of thepeople.I saw Tshekedi later, but he produced so many documents and talked at suchlength that I agreed to continue the talks in London. I intend to tell him thatthe White Paper policy must be enforced and that he must not enter the Reservesave for the most exceptional reasons. I will make this decision public so that itshall be known to the Bamangwato. I hope Tshekedi, who is extremely able, will. accept some useful job in connexion with the economic development of theTerritory.This whole affair is tricky. I am hopeful that the Bamangwato will settle downand develop a more democratic council system. I have received reports (including!letters from leading tribesmen to people in this country) that the Bamangwato areprepared to accept the decisions I announced to them and to get on with the jobof getting the Native Administration going again. They received my speech atthe Kgotla well.   All signs of non-co-operation have disappeared.&apos;20. I met a good many of the Chiefs in all three High Commission Territories.I have no doubt that the institution, of Chieftainship in these Territories is essential.It is very strongly established, and only through it can the administration (e.g., in anti-erosion work) be carried on. There are stirrings against the old order due tothe emergence of a small minority of able and well-educated Africans, who are usually more capable than the Chiefs. The widened experience of the thousands of Pioneers who served overseas in the war has also led to a desire for greaterparticipation by the people in their own administration. We must therefore pre-vail upon the Chiefs to work with elected councils and to decentralise their authorityto local councils. I stressed this in all my speeches in the Territories and in myprivate talks with leading Chiefs. These developments are already in hand. Theywill need delicate and skilful handling.The ablest man among the Chiefs is Sobhuza, Paramount Chief of the Swazi.He is well educated and speaks excellent English. His general policy is to be veryprogressive in the establishment of schools, &amp;c, and in pressing on anti-erosionwork; and at the same time to preserve and share in all the old tribal customs andtraditions. When I first met him in his own tribe he was naked to the waist anddecked in gorgeous feathers, beads and a skin-kilt. Later than afternoon he turnedup at the Resident Commissioner^ garden party and was the best-dressed man therein a beautifully cut suit. He has ten wives. I had a long talk with him and foundthat he was very satisfied with the way things are going. He is strongly againstSeretse&apos;s,marriage, and thinks that he should be compelled to choose between Ruthand the Chieftainship. If he wants to stick to Ruth, he should abdicate. Sobhuzaplans to have a meeting of all the leading Chiefs of the three Territories (includingthe leading men of the Bamangwato) to discuss the whole matter.The Paramount Chief of the Basuto is a lady called &apos; M&apos;antsebo Seeiso. Sheis famous for her smart Western hats (no-one knows how she keeps them on hershort, frizzy hair) and highly coloured shoes.. She is, unfortunately, not a very strong ruler, and like too many Chiefs is rather too fond of gin). She was almost certainly involved in a number of medicine murders, though the proof was nevercomplete. She became very scared when two other Chiefs were hanged for suchmurders and she is now co-operating in stamping them out.Unfortunately Bechuanaland has no Paramount Chief, but consists of anumber of separate and equal tribes. On the whole, the level of the Chiefs is notvery high. Tshekedi was the outstanding one when he was Regent of the bamangwato.21. I was impressed by the calibre of our senior officials in the Territories,though I think it will be necessary for the junior officials to acquire more experienceof administration&apos;in other of our African territories.As His Majesty&apos;s Government, through the Secretary of State, is directly responsible for the administration of these three Territories, I gave particular atten-tion to the question whether the machinery for discharging this responsibility can be improved. I found little that need be done. But I think the three Territories need to be treated rather more as a single entity than has been the case in the past. I ammaking detailed arrangements to secure this. I am also considering the enhance-ment of the status of the Chief Secretary by making him a Deputy High Commis-sioner. He could then, on the one hand better co-ordinate policy in the three territories, and on the other hand better serve as a channel between them and theSecretary of State.  The Deputy High Commissioner would, of course, be under
the High Commissioner but he would have greater authority over the ResidentCommissioners in each of the Territories.I intend also to send out to the Territories for short terms officials in my Officewho deal with the Territories and bring back for short terms to London some ofthe officials in the field. I discussed all these matters with the High Commissionerwho is in agreement with me about them.      &apos;,(iii) The Union of South Africa22. South African politics are extremely sharp and bitter. The nationalist party (Malan&apos;s) has many of the characteristics of a devoted movement of liberation.It uses Afrikaans as a political weapon; it puts its own people in every possibleoffice; and it believes unshakably in its cause. The leaders have long been in thewilderness and live and dream politics: their wives are as jnuch in the movementas they are.To some extent the Nationalists are still fighting the Boer War-or rather theyhave just won it. (When they say &quot; the war &quot; they mean the Boer War.) they regard as their enemy not so much the United Kingdom as the British in SouthAfrica and they are taking a long-delayed revenge for what they regard asoppression.A main motive behind the Nationalist faith is that the Afrikaner has no otherhome but Africa. He resents the way in which the British can look to Britain and often send their children to be educated here. The Afrikaner glories in South africa and is filled with a desperate determination to keep it as his home and to be masterin his own house.23. I was extremely disappointed in the British in South Africa. Theyundoubtedly regarded the Boer War as their victory over the Afrikaners. For ageneration they have been (and still are) very arrogant and despise the Afrikaners.They refuse to learn or use Afrikaans. They have kept all jobs in the great industriesthey control for British people. They have excluded Afrikaners from their clubs.Worst of all, they have completely failed to go into national public life. Recentlyan attempt was made to find a British candidate for Smuts&apos;s seat a safe seat. Butnot one could be.found. The British in South Africa deserve the &quot;persecution&quot;that is now being visited upon them by the Nationalists.Incidentally, the worst race relations of all are in cities dominated by theBritish Johannesburg and Durban. On the other hand, the best relations I sawwere in another British town Port Elizabeth, the only town without Pass Lawsfor the Africans. The early English settlers are much better than the British who came in to open up the gold mines of the Transvaal and the sugar estates of Natal.The British still have a very considerable influence. They command greatwealth and they are very efficient indeed in business. The English Press is much larger and more influential than the Afrikaans Press. Nevertheless, the Afrikanersare steadily advancing and colouring the whole nation. They are dominant in the countryside and are gradually entering all the towns, which used to be Britishpreserves.24. The best people in South Africa seemed to me to be the Afrikaners inthe United Party (Smuts&apos;s party). They are well-educated, self-confident and have in many respects sensible policies. They are loyal to the British connexion andknow much more about the world than the Nationalists. There are a great manyAfrikaners who oppose the Nationalists even in its strongholds. This infuriatesthe Nationalists, who regard them as traitors.25. The Nationalists have two main objectives which tend to be contradictory:this makes their policy unstable and difficult to predict. In a nutshell, the twoobjectives may be said to be to pursue simultaneously an anti-Black and an anti-British policy. (The anti-British policy always being more against the local Britishthan against the United Kingdom though the two become confused, as the localBritish want to preserve the realities and the symbols of the British connexion.)So long as the Nationalists concentrate on an anti-Black policy they get a gooddeal of British support in elections. And this they need to keep them in power.But if they push their anti-British policy too far they will lose their British support.It is not always realised how far the Nationalists get British votes and the united party gets Afrikaner votes. If the Nationalists stressed too strongly theirRepublicanism or any policy that involved a breach with the United Kingdom,practically the whole British population would vote against them.
Moreover, the present Government in South Africa is very conscious of itsisolation in the world and of the value of the friendship and support of Britain,which tends to carry Commonwealth support with it. They are also highlyconscious of the Russian Communist danger. They tend, therefore, to cling to their good relations with Britain and to flinch from actions that would involve an openbreach. In defence, for instance, they are more forthcoming than Smuts ever daredbe in peace-time.In consequence, the Nationalists tend to limit their anti-British actions to the domestic field and to keep their anti-Black policies more pronounced than theiranti-British policies. Typical of this is the appalling Voortrekker Monument outsidePretoria. This is designed as a national shrine and though it is very ugly and rather hysterical---it has some of the characteristics of such a shrine. It is, however,completely Afrikaner. You would not know from seeing it that there were any british in South Africa. It emphasises the struggle between Afrikaner and Bantuand outside this &quot; national shrine &quot; is a notice that non-Europeans are admittedonly on Tuesdays.The Nationalists are steadily putting their own supporters into places of authority and into the Police and Army. Their strict application of the rule ofbi-Hngualism is in effect excluding the British. They are very effectively rigging the electorate in their favour. This underlies their present bill to exclude the CapeColoured from the electoral roll they all voted for the United Party. It alsoexplains the large representation given to South-West Africa.On the whole the Nationalists are far better and keener politicians than theUnited Party and much more ruthless. The United Party is fairly confident of winning the next election, but in my view they are wrong unless the Nationalistsdo something that involves a breach with Britain.26. It must always be remembered, however, that the Nationalists are highlyemotional and absolutely convinced of their Tightness. They are apt at any timeto do something stupid and completely against their own real interests. It wouldbe easy to provoke them into actions that they might later regret but would, never-theless, do with intransigent obstinacy. They are in some respects comparable to the Irish Nationalists: they have a logic of their own that is grounded onemotions and hatreds that it is practically impossible for us to understand.27.  Personalities are very important in South African politics.Amongst the Nationalists, Malan is (comparatively) a moderate. He is 76 andis an old Reformed Dutch preacher and has all the longings and hatreds of an extreme Predikant. He is, however, a very shrewd old boy and has some grasp ofpolitical realities. He is inclined to satisfy the more extreme Nationalists bygestures often foolish ones. The things he does actually carry through aremeasures against Africans and Indians and measures that give him electoraladvantage. He has some qualities. He has been ready to spend most of his political life in the wilderness for his convictions: he is very religious: he keepshis word. He has a very high regard for Mr. Attlee and wants to have close relations with Britain.   He is very conscious of the danger of world communism.Malan does not seem to have a very good hold over his Cabinet and tends to be pushed along by the extremists. This has become more marked since theNationalist victory in the South-West Africa elections which gave them a majoritythat makes them independent of the support of Havenga and his followers (theAfrikaner Party). Havenga is another &quot; moderate &quot; and Malan relies much on him.He has been longer Finance Minister than any other in the Commonwealth and is extremely orthodox. He is also extremely ambitious. He has always said that hewould not agree to the disfranchisement of the Cape Coloured: but directly helost his grip on the balance of power (through the South-West Africa elections) hechanged his tune. One motive was his desire to be Prime Minister after Malan:another was probably to maintain the &quot;moderate&quot; control of the Cabinet. IfMalan dies I think Havenga will be the next Prime Minister. He would be a useful&quot; moderate &quot; cover for the extremists: and these are not yet ready to engage in the fight amongst themselves for leadership that must soon come. The leaders of the extremists in the Cabinet are Donges and Strydom (pronounced Stray-dom). Theyare both outstandingly able and it is generally assumed that one or other will bePrime Minister. A great many people on the United Party side hope that Dongeswill win: he is regarded as less extreme and more realistic. It is also thought thathis attendance at the last Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting in London may have widenedhis horizons (as it undoubtedly did).   In my view he would make the worse Prime
Minister of thetwp. ,:He is much cleverer than Strydom and more supple and adroit.He can put on a reasonable face. But he is extremely bitter arid; would always be working, by however indirect means, to make South Africa completely Afrikaner.Strydom is much more direct and fundamentally honest. He, too, is extremeand - might well do a number of foolish things, especially at first. But I think hewould learn in the same way that Malan has, and one would know where one was with him. It is most important that he should be prevailed upon to visit England.I worked on him (and on his wife) and I think they will in due course respond toan invitation. kHr \ &apos;.i t K Though I think Strydom would be the better of the two from our point of view-the prospect of either is Very disquieting.; If Donges and Strydom deadlock for leadership or shrink from splitting theparty, it is possible that Sauer may get the Prime Ministership. He is the mosthuman of the Nationalists and a man of considerable ability. But it is hard tosay what sort of a leader he would make. He would probably be relatively&quot;moderate &quot; and aware of South Africa&apos;s position in the world.I was much impressed by Strauss, the new leader of the United Party. He has long been overshadowed by Smuts and is much under-rated. He does not try toimitate Smuts, but he is developing his own character, which is confident, calm andfarsighted. He will never be a great orator or world-figure-but he is rapidlybecoming a leader with in some ways greater moral courage and directness thanSmuts. He stands head and shoulders above the rest of his party, which is mostundistinguished.There are a few good Civil Servants who are likely to play an important role.Outstanding amongst these is Forsyth, the Secretary for External Affairs. He is the child of British and Afrikaner parents and is a solid man, very friendly to us.28. The South African policy towards African Natives is fundamentallydifferent from Southern RhOdesia&apos;s. It is based on the theory of permanentexclusion of Africans from any share in government or political rights. In theoryApartheid involves the material and social development of the Africans and tosome extent this is carried out in practice. For instance, African school-teachers,nurses, &amp;c, receive considerably higher wages than in our High Commission Terri-tories and (so I was told) in the Colonies. Very considerable sums (almost whollyraised by taxes upon the Whites) are spent on the material welfare of Africans.Very large areas are set aside as Native Reserves. In these, extremely costly anti-erosion work is carried on hundreds of miles of wire-fencing at  100 a mile.The officials of the Native Affairs Department are mostly keen and devotedworkers, who clearly do not like the policies of the present Government. They treat the Africans as permanent children but they put great energy into their welfare and development. Most of the Africans in the Reserves are still very primitive with very low standards of cultivation. Faction fights of great fierceness are fairlyfrequent and sometimes result in a good many deaths.Treatment of the Africans by these officials in the Native Reserves is whollydifferent from the treatment in the towns like Johannesburg, which I have already mentioned.29. It was hard to form an opinion about the attitude of Africans in the reserves&apos;.. I saw some who.were extremely primitive and seemingly happy andunconcerned. I saw others who were being trained in agriculture and domesticscience and those seemed at least eager to raise the standards of their own people.I was introduced to one Chief in the Transkei Chief Poto, who is regarded asrather a showrpiece and who co-operates very well in anti-erosion work and runshis court competently. His proudest possession was a picture of The King andQueen. I got him to myself for a moment and asked him his attitude to the high commission Territories. He said that Africans in South Africa regarded theinhabitants of the Territories as having superior rights and we must on no accountlet them be incorporated until conditions were as good in the Union.I also asked Chief Poto about Seretse. He said we had taken the only possiblecourse30. I spoke with African political leaders in Johannesburg and Indian leaders in Durban. The Union authorities knew that I was having these talks but the talks themselves weire private and confidential and the confidence has been strictlykept. Both sets of leaders impressed me by their moderation and responsibility.With all they have had, to put up with one might expect them to be extreme and40458 toteri   % N -I &apos; c
bitter men. They are firmly anti-Communist and believe in constitutional method?.Although denied all political fights, they do indeed possess some means of expressing their views mainly &apos; through their press, which is free. The verywealthy Indian leaders in Durban and Natal get much that they want by bribingCouncillors and officials. &apos; &apos;      *The African leaders talked to me mainly about the High Commission Terri-tofies. Their information; about economic and social progress in the Territorieswas out of date and they were inclined to assume that it was our intention to yieldthem up. I did my best to reassure them. .The Indian leaders were mainly concerned about the Group Areas Act (which enables the Government to set up by law segregated racial areas). They were con-vinced that this Act is primarily aimed at the economic destruction of the Indiancommunity in order to force them to repatriate themselves to India. They allsaid that they would, under no circumstances, go to India, where economic con-ditions were far worse than in the Union. They emphasised that they were south africans. If there were no social segregation in economic affairs they would theni-selves be quite prepared to arrange voluntarily that all Indians should reside in special areas.Both the African and Indian leaders wanted His Majesty&apos;s Government to intervene in one way or another on their behalf, and I had to explain the limita-tions imposed by the conventions of Commonwealth relations. I have since hadappreciative letters from both sets of leaders.31. Owing to the ever more acute labour shortage in all Southern Africait is quite possible that the material standards and education of Africans in theUnion will be improved. Only by improving the output of Africans can the labour shortage be solved. This will, of course, make it increasingly difficult for theWhites to hold the Africans down. I saw, however, no signs of violent opposition.I doubt whether the Africans are, or for long will be, capable of any sort of organised underground movement. If there is violence it is more likely to take theform of a sudden spontaneous blood-letting by the Africans of the Reserves andthe slums.32. I spent some time looking at a Compound on a Rand gpld mine, as con-siderable numbers of Africans from Bechuanaland and Basutoland work there.The compounds are extremely efficiently run, with excellent food supplies andkitchens, water-borne sewage, baths and provision for recreation- Every Africanrecruit is X-rayed, and if any of them lose 5, lb. of weight in a month he is at oncemedically examined. The hospitals provided are very good. If gold is to be pro-duced at all, and if this is to be done by workers who are separated from theirwomen, it is hard to think of a better way than these compounds to which manyof the workers return many times during their lives- As far as we are concernedit would not be in our interests were married quarters substituted for compoundsas this would depopulate the High Commission Territories, We have an arrange-ment by which the interests of High Commission workers in the mines are lookedafter by our own agents a proportion of the wages earned is paid to the workerafter his return to the Territory. This has largely done away with the drift ofour workers from the mines into the great cities; it also brings considerable sumsinto the Territories and ensures that the wives have a chartce of getting their fair share. &apos; -So long as we need to supply this labour, the present system works well. our policy should be to help it work, and steadily to reduce our need for this labour-outlet by developing the economic resources of the Territories. ;33. Our High Commission Territories (and for that matter Southern Rhodesiatoo) are largely dependent on the Union for the secondary and higher education of Africans. The ban recently imposed by the Union on all nonrUnion Africansentering their schools and Universities threatened us with very grave difficulties.The ban has been suspended for three years and may not be reimposed. We must,however, prepare alternative forms of education, though this will cost money. I discussed with Sir Godfrey Huggins an idea he put forward for an AfricanUniversity to be established in Francistown (in Bechuanalarid) to be jointly financed by the two Rhodesias and the three Territories. The High Commissioner is nowsympathetically considering this idea amongst several others. \34. I visited our naval bgse at Simonstown. In view-sof what Erasmus,; theMinister of Defence, said whilst he was in London and of a factual meniarandum
he gave me whilst I was in the Union it was, rather surprising that he never raised thequestion of the transfer of this base to the Union, though I had several talks withhim on defence matters. The base is very well run: it is the only corner of theUnion where the colour ban is wholly absent and skilled workers of all colourswbrk happily side by side.Although we will have one day to face the question of the transfer of this, base and may have to make some concessions to South African sovereignty, I think this day is a good way off. The Union is quite, incapable of running a great base like this (its Navy is a sub-department of its Army). I think we may hope to play this problem very long., (iv) Problems of Policy35. Our relations with the Union of South Africa raise appallinglv difficult problems, for which there can be no simple solutions.36. It seems to me that one of our prime aims must be to contain. SouthAfrica. By this I do not mean that we should pursue a hostile policy towards theUnion: indeed, as I argue later, I think we must be friendly. By containment Imean that we must prevent the spread of its influence and territorial sovereigntynorthwards. This will not be at all easy to achieve as South Africa is infinitelythe most powerful political unit on the whole African continent. Its economic,and therefore its potential military, strength is rapidly increasing. There are,moreover, in Central and East Africa settled white populations tha.t the Union may hope to bring under its political leadership and protection. It would be illusoryto count on internal racial tensions frustrating South Africa&apos;s plans of expansion.These internal tensions may indeed one day become insurmountable, but we cannotsimply sit back and reckon on this happening in time to prevent South Africanexpansion.37. We can only succeed in containing South Africa and playing the very strong cards that we have in our hand if we seriously set this objective of contain-ment as a genuine aim of our policy. This would mean that we do not regard as our sole objective the emancipation and political advancement of the African inall our African colonies. That must of course remain a major objective, but wemust not subordinate all else to it. .If we wish to contain South Africa we must succeed in keeping the whitecommunities in Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and even Kenya inde-pendent of, and distinct from, the Union. This should not be too difficult to do asthey are all very British and. very loyal. They like neither Afrikaners norRepublicans. But here too we must have a positive policy. We cannot count onthis loyalty alone and for ever. If we dp not shape our policies aright there is avery real danger indeed that, to avoid domination by Africans, these white com-munities will in the end throw in their lot with the Union.38. We must in our long-term African policies reckon this as a grave danger to be set alongside the danger of some African (and Indian) discontent. should we, intentionally or by default, throw British communities in East and central africa into the arms of. the Union our whole work in.Africa would be undone.The policies that we detest in the Union would be established far to the Northand in the heart of this part of our Colonial Empire. Millions of Africans wouldbe subjected to oppression. Terrible wars might even be fought between a white-ruled Eastern Africa and a black-ruled Western Africa.; 39. It would be a fatal mistake to count on our power to prevent these thingshappening if in fact our policies tend to bring them about. In the last resort wedo not control these British communities by power. As they grow richer and more numerous they will become potential American colonies very loyal, but verydetermined to have their own way. If we are in due course faced by defiance ofour will in the Rhodesias or Kenya there will in effect be nothing that we can doabout it.   Certainly our power on the spot would be inferior to South Africans..   .40. Fortunately these dangers are not imminent. But they will come upon us if we allow the impression to arise that we are committed to a policy of sub-ordinating Whites to Africans. Rather than face that the Whites will in the endrevolt. I am not at the moment concerned about the morality of their possibleactions but about their possibility. It would be small comfort to us to have beenright, if the consequence were the effective end of our position in Africa and the40458 d
effective frustration of all our well-intentioned policies. i Certainly tens of millions of Africans for whom we are responsible would be calamitously worse off.41. The test-case will be Southern Rhodesia. This, country already haspractical independence. The day is not far Off when it could defy us with impunityif we sought to interfere improperly, as its white inhabitants would think in itsinternal affairs. We certainly could do nothing to prevent Southern Rhpdesia&apos;saccession to the Union were they to decide on such a course. As it seems to me the whole fate of our policy in Southern Africa turns on whether Southern Rhodesiais drawn Northwards or Southwards. It is not big enough to remain for ever aseparate unit without access to the sea. At the moment its loyalties are with britain but if we do not succeed in attaching Southern Rhodesia to the North,it will inevitably turn ultimately to the Union. As I say above (paragraph 10)there is even now a force in Southern Rhodesia in favour of incorporation with south Africa, that it would be folly to ignore. We must^ therefore, it seems to me,adopt a deliberate policy of attracting Southern Rhodesia to the North. If we donot, we will fail to contain South Africa and in the end all our good work and all our influence will be ruined.42. I would therefore propose that it should become one of our cardinalpolicies to keep Southern Rhodesia out of the Union, This is a key-stone of thepolicy of containing South Africa. This should be a policy of equal weight and importance in our eyes with the political advancement of the Africans in our central and East African colonies. It should not be a secondary or subordinate policy,but an equal one.43. This-Would involve a shift in the emphasis of our policy and it would notbe popular or easy. It is very easy for Africans and many in Britain, and especiallymany in the Labour Party, to say that there is no difference between SouthernRhodesia and South Africa in respect of Native policy. Anyone who stands upfor a policy of binding Southern Rhodesia closer to pur colonies in the North willhave to face a pretty vocal chores of abuse, both from Africans and from sectionsof British Opinion. It is, of course, true that Southern Rhodesian Native policy is different from ours: but it does not follow from that that it is identical with theUnion&apos;s. It is, in fact, different (see paragraphs 7, 8, 9 and 28 above). It is aboutas good a Native policy as one can expect at this stage from any considerablesettled White population. If we insist on treating it as being identical with SouthAfrican Native policy we shall in the end succeed in making it so. By drivingSouthern Rhodesia into the Union we would allow a fatai shift of the balanpe of power and immensely increase the attractive power of the Union&apos;s policy for Whitecommunities in neighbouring colonies. By listening to the protests of Africans andothers against any truck with Southern Rhodesia we would in the end betray ourtrust to the Africans by being unable effectively to protect thern against SouthAfrican Native policy. It would not be against South African expansionism as such that we would have to contend but against the will of our own white communities.44, We will soon be faced by a practical problem that will raise this veryissue in an acute form namely, the question of some, form of closer association between Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. I do not hereWish to argue the merits of this question; the recommendations of the recentofficials&apos; conference will have to come before Ministers. But one issue that will haveto be decided may well be whether Southern Rhodesia is to go Northwards orSouthwards. Closer union may now encounter some opposition: but if we fail to face it, the result may be that Southern Rhodesia finally loses hope in any possibility of closer association with her Northern neighbours. Moreover, werewe at some later time&apos;to attempt again to achieve some spit of a Central AfricanUnion, we-would certainly find African opinion even more strongly against it.45. Apart from positively drawing Southern Rhodesia northwards it shouldbe our policy to widen in every possible way the gulf between Southern rhodesia and South Africa. South Africa^ economic arid other influences upon SouthernRhodesia are bound to remain strong and Southern Rhodesia must live jn peaceful and - neighbourly, -relations with the Union; nevertheless, there are naturaldifferences between them.46. One of these concerns South African migration to Southern Rhodesia(paragraph 5 above). Here we should give Southern Rhodesia all possible support in her desire to restrict migration from the Union and to encourage it from Britain
47. . Another example, is to be found in railway development; which is a highlypolitical problem. Furtner railway lines and links are certain to be developed in southern Africa and are badly needed. Where they are built will largely determine the balances of political influence. There is at this very moment a dispute betweenSouthern Rhodesia and South Africa about a projected new railway link. SouthAfrica wahts&apos; tp see built the; link that would be most economical: but this routewould put Southern Rhodesia at the mercy of South Africa and powerfully advanceSouth African influence dyer Southern Rhodesia. (Incidentally, it would also largelyruin the Bechuanaland Protectorate-see above (paragraph 17). This is a case&apos;where&apos;we&apos; should, as we are doing, use pur influence against the economicallydesirable and obvious spiutipn.48. We should also do what we can to help direct capital into SouthernRhpdesia. Very considerable sums of private British capital are goihg mto thedevelopment pf the Union-particularly into gold mines and secondary industries.This is, of course, important: but, Other things being equal, it would pay us tosee a proper proportion of our capital going to Southern Rhodesia. It is not inour long-term interest to see South Africans economic development altogetheroutstripping Southern Rhodesia&apos;s.49. Into this general framework pf policy must fit our intentions about thfHigh Commission Territories. These cannot be indefinitely held unless there ibehind them a solid block of British territory that is distinct from and independent of the Union. The three Territories can be indefinitely held as outposts or bastionsof such a block. Their fate will be sealed if South Africa&apos;s influence and areaspreads further North. As outposts or breakwaters the Territories, indeed, can play a coherent part in our policy. Otherwise we can at best hope for a hand-to-mouthpolicy of holding them as long as we can against great odds.      &quot;50. I have returned very much more confident of indefinitely holding the territories, on condition that our. whole Southern and Central African policy is far-sighted, and on condition that we do not make any foolish mistakes. SouthAfrica is very conscious of its need for British friendship and there are inSouth Africa powerful forces that positively desire to retain the British connexion(see above, paragraphs 23 to 25). This means that we should be able to keep SouthAfrican internal opinion divided on the issue of the incorporation of the Territories.Every White South African, of.course, wants to see the incorporation of the territories, and will always declare himself to be in principle in favour pfincorporation But a very large section of the population does not want to break with Britain on the issue and will always find that the moment is not opportune forpressing the demand. I was surprised to find how strong was the reaction in theBritish Press in the Union against Mai an&apos;s Cape Town speech about incorporation.I was surprised, too, to find how fairly the whole Press (including the Afrikaanspapers) reported my version of the meaning of the relevant Acts. There is a prettywidespread realisation that it would be unwise to take over wholly hostile pppula-tions. Strauss, the leader of the United Party, said privately that he did not see how the Territories could ever be taken over by South Africa. The populations of the territories were to a man against it, and even if the United Party got back to powerand improved the lot of the African in the Union, the fear would be present thatthe Nationalists would once again get back to power.51. I think we can therefore fairly confidently adopt a policy of indefinitelyholding the Territories. But only if South African opinion continues to be divided.If anything happened that both united and inflamed South African opinion on this issue, we would be helpless. The influences that.we can exercise over the Unionbecause of her need for us and because of her material and political interests, wouldbecome quite feeble. In certain moods South Africa will do things that are pig-headedly doctrinaire and against all her best interests. (See above paragraph 26.) Ifthe Union put the incorporation of the Territories above every other interest, wecould not resist her economic and even perhaps military power. The Territories arenot large enough even to be administered as wholly distinct units. The railwaysthat run through them belong to the Union: the currency is South African: thecustoms are joint. The frontiers are unguarded and such things as control of cattle disease and anti-erosion work must be done in co-ordination. Nearly all theconsumer goods needed by the Territories must come.through the Union: all the territories&apos; exports must go out into or through the Union.
52. If we are to hold the Territories.) we must, therefore, as an integral partOf this; policy, take public opinion in the Union into account and so direct our actionsas to play upon it. (This is, in my view, the decisive reason why the territories should be administered by the C.R.O.)53. This means that we. cannot in what we do in the Territories ignore reactionsupon South African public opinion. There are many things we can and should do thatthey do not like. For instance, they do not like the way we are putting developmentfunds into the Territories. Nor will they like it when we set up an independentPost Office in Swaziland, as we intend to do. What we must refrain from doingare those acts that would unite and inflame Union public opinion. That is a luxurythat we cannot afford if we seriously want to hold the Territories and use them aspart of our policy of containing the Union.54. Amongst acts that would unite and&apos;inflame Union opinion would havebeen the recognition of Seretse and. Ruth. This view was confirmed by severalleading Africans in the Union with whom I discussed the matter. After seeingthings on the spot for myself, I am more convinced than ever that our decision aboutSeretse was right. Quite apart from internal Bamangwato considerations, a decisionto recognise Seretse would have very gravely endangered our tenure of the territories.So probably would a decision to arm the Africans in the Territories. We canonce again very usefully raise Pioneer Corps amongst them, but were we to armAfricans in the midst of the Union, we would run a very grave risk of losing the territories..55. While we firmly announce our intention to keep the Territories-byreiterating our established policy about consultation and while we develop themeconomically and refrain only from extremely provocative actions at the sametime we should be ready to develop those relations with the Union that bind her to us and make her unwilling to risk a break with us. These relations are also inour own direct interest. Chief amongst them come co-operation in defence andin economic matters. Also important is to give the Union what help and guidancewe decently can at the United Nations. Those who argue that because we dislikethe Union&apos;s Native policy we should ostracise her and have nothing to do with her completely fail to understand the realities of the situation. Such a policy wouldnot only gravely harm us in the defence and economic fields, it would also weaken our power to deter South Africa from foolhardy acts from fear of breaking with us. It would immediately and directly reduce our chances of holding the Territories,which form a vital part in any policy of containing and confining the Union&apos;sinfluence and territorial expansion in Southern Africa.P.
