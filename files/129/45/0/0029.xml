(51) 1st Conclusions, Minute 4) the Cabinet approvedcomprehensive proposals regarding the Japanese Peace Treaty contained in aMemorandum circulated by my predecessor (CP. (50) 323). The policy thenapproved has since been put to the United States Government on three separateoccasions: unofficially in conversations between Mr. Dulles (who has been charged by President Truman with the task of preparing the Japanese Peace Treaty) and HisMajesty&apos;s Representatives in Washington and Tokyo, and in Canberra by Sir E.Dening, during January and February; officially, in concise form, in an aide-Memoire handed to the United States Government on 12th March; and ina draft Peace Treaty which was handed to the State Department as an unofficialworking document on 9th April. The views of the United States Government havebeen made clear to us in similar stages: first, in the discussions with Mr. Dulles;secondly, in an Aide-Memoire handed to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Washington on 14th March; and, thirdly, in a preliminary draft Treaty handed to His Majesty&apos;s embassy in Washington on 23rd March. Copies of the United Kingdom and united States drafts, arranged as parallel texts for purposes of comparison, are at annex A.2.   The problems to be considered fall into three categories:  (a) The form of the Treaty.ib) Issues of substance in the Treaty.(c) Procedural questions related to the Treaty, including the questions of timing,consultations with other Governments and general programme of work.The Form of the Treaty3. The most striking difference between the American draft and our own is in length. The United States draft is much shorter and more loosely worded than our own. While I sympathise with the United States Governmenfs wish to see simple and non-restrictive type of peace settlement, I feel that the general formof the United Kingdom draft is more appropriate to our purpose. It would be against the interests of future relations between the free world and Japan to givethe Peace Treaty a form which was not sufficiently precise or comprehensive andtherefore left points of friction open for the future; it is far better to face difficultiesin the Treaty and do everything possible to resolve them, within the framework of the liberal type of settlement which both our Governments wish to ensure; anda Peace Treaty of this type seems best calculated to ensure the resumption of normalrelations between Japan and the participants in the Treaty, and indeed all the restof the free world.4. Mr. Dulles has informed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington thathe personally would be glad to see a draft Treaty agreed between our two Govern-ments, which could then be circulated to the other Governments concerned in both our names. I ani attracted by this offer and am seeking to obtain confirmation ofit. I have also suggested that our representatives should be ready to begindiscussions with the United States Government about 23rd April.
The Substance of the Treaty5, My recommendations on the main points of substance, which are discussed in more detail in Annex B, are as follows:- :    WV fe^fi(a) The preamble to the Treaty should contain a declaration by Japan of herintentions (if to apply for membership of the United Nations Organisation;(2) to uphold the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;(3) to maintain conditions of stability and well-being in Japan as providedfor in post-war Japanese legislation; : \Wi       i\      i(4) to conform to internationally accepted fair trade practices.(b) The preamble to the Treaty should hot, however, bind the signatory states to facilitate the realisation of Japan&apos;s intentions enumerated above-e.g., to supportJapan&apos;s application for membership of the United Nations.(c) We should not seek, in view of the United States Government^ attitude,to secure a reference in the Treaty to the responsibility of the Japanese militaristregime for having provoked a state of war.id) Specific reference in the Treaty to Japan&apos;s having surrendered uncon-ditionally in terms of the Potsdam Proclamation would be undesirable.(e) Subject to further consultation with Commonwealth Governments, weshould not insist that the Treaty should require Japan to renounce all past and present claims in the Antarctic Continent and in the islands adjacent thereto, or that it should prohibit Japan from making such claims in the future.; (/) We should not. press for the inclusion in the Treaty of provision for theprotection of Japanese nationals who sympathised with or supported the Alliesbetween the outbreak of war and the coming into force of the Peace Treaty.(g) We should accept the United States Government&apos;s suggestion in its DraftPeace Treaty that the exercise of the power to grant clemency, reduction of sentencesand parole to war criminals serving their sentences in Japan should be exercisedjointly by the Allied Government concerned and the Japanese Government. Weshould also accept the suggestion that war criminals convicted by the InternationalMilitary Tribunal for the Far East should only receive clemency, reduction of sentences or parole with the agreement of the majority of the States representedoh the Tribunal. In no circumstances, however, should we agree to the Treatystating that convicted war criminals are eligible for pardon.(h) We should agree with the United States Government that the Peace treaty should not require Japan to prevent the resurgence of undesirable political societiessince such a provision is likely to prove unenforceable.(/) In view of the attitude of the United States Government, but subject tofurther consultation with Commonwealth Governments, we should no longer seek to insist that stocks of Japanese gold should be made available as reparations.(/) Subject to further consultation with Commonwealth Governments, weshould agree to the inclusion in the Treaty of an Article on the lines of Article 89of the Peace Treaty with Italy stipulating that no State which did not become a party to the Peace Treaty would receive any right, title or benefit granted to it inthe Treaty.(k) While all Japanese assets in Allied countries should, by the Peace Treaty,be placed at the absolute disposal of those States, exceptions should be made in thefollowing cases:  (a) Property of the Japanese Government used for Consular or Diplomaticpurposes.(b) Property of religious or charitable institutions used exclusively for such purposes. -  ..Procedure6. Questions of procedure are examined in Annex C, and the special questionof Russian participation in Annex D. This paper does not cover the questions of chinese participation and the disposal of Formosa, which were recently discussed by the Cabinet as a separate issue (CM. (51) 22nd Meeting, Item 3). As regardsprocedure, my recommendations are as follows:(/) Russia should be offered the opportunity to participate in the Peace Treaty,but we should be prepared to conclude it without Russia rather than allow it to beheld up by Russian obstruction.
17.9.3(m) The draft Peace Treaty should be agreed as soon as possible between theGovernments of the principal parties, being the countries most closely concerned,namely, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Ceylon, India, New Zealand,Pakistan, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Burma, Indonesia, the philippines, and (assuming it can be arranged for them to participate) Russia and china.(n) We should prefer that the Republic of Korea should not be included amongthe principal parties, but if, as is possible, the United States Government attach importance to this, we need not insist on our view.(o) The proceedings should, if possible, be carried on through the diplomaticchannel, rather than at a Peace Conference with all its attendant disadvantages of delay and publicity, but a formal Conference should be held to sign the Treaty.(p) The Treaty should be signed by the principal parties only, and there should ,be provision for the accession of the other belligerents.Consultation with Commonwealth and other Governments7. The policy approved by the Cabinet on 2nd January (CM. (51) 1st Con-clusions, Minute 4) was explained to the Conference of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters in London, and it was agreed that individual Commonwealth Govern-ments would consider the matter further. In spite of frequent reminders, noCommonwealth Government has yet expressed views on the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment since that date. They have, however, been kept informed of every stage of the discussions with the United States, and in those discussions we havebeen careful to make it clear that we speak for the United Kingdom only. all commonwealth Governments and the French and Netherlands Governments havereceived copies of all the documents referred to in paragraph 1 above.(q) With the permission of my colleagues, I propose to keep the Common-wealth, French and Netherlands Governments fairly fully informed on the progress ;of our talks.General Programme of Work8.  Both we and the United States Government are anxious to see the earliest ;possible conclusion of this Treaty, and the situation has not altered in this respectwith the departure of General MacArthur. The general programme which I pro-pose is:  (r) Talks between our representatives beginning about 23rd April, either in washington or in London, in an effort to reconcile the two drafts and also to agree on the procedural questions.(s) A round of exchanges with Commonwealth and friendly Governmentsthrough the diplomatic channels.[t) Reference back to the Cabinet of any major points on which it has notbeen able to secure agreement.(u) Discussions, probably in Washington, on drafting the final text.(v) Reference back to Governments for approval.(w) Signature of the Treaty, possibly in Washington, though this has not been settled.(x) Ratification.9. Assuming that no major difficulties arise, it may be possible to.begin thediscussions on drafting (the stage referred to in paragraph 8 (w)) towards the endof May so that the final draft might come back to us for governmental approvalsome time in June and the signature take place perhaps in July. This, I think, isthe best we can hope for and the programme may of course be delayed if unfore-seen difficulties arise. Even with this programme, however, my colleagues maynote that it may not be possible to table the Treaty in the House before the summer recess.10.   The next step is to comment as we have been invited to do on the UnitedStates draft Treaty.  For this purpose a brief will be prepared for the use of our,representatives in accordance with the decisions on the points on which I am nowinviting your agreement.11.  I invite my colleagues to agree to the proposals set out above.- \  , \ .   . .   &apos; .   &quot;     H. M.      .: ,Foreign Office, S.W. 1,\6th April, 1951.
f:      180ANNEX A -JAPANESE PEACE TREATY: PROVISIONAL DRAFTS(1)Memorandum by the United States Govern-ment. (Communicated by the state department to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in washington on 23rd March, 1951)Annexed hereto is a provisional draftmggestiveonly) of a Treaty of Peace withipan. This formulation follows exchangesf views between representatives of theovernment of the United States and repre-^ntatives of the Governments of Australia,urma, Canada, Ceylon, China, France,jidia, Indonesia, Korea, the Netherlands,ew Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, thenited Kingdom and the Union of Sovietlocialist Republics. These exchanges ofews took place principally during theiriod of September 1950 to January 1951Iid included at least one exchange, and inost cases several exchanges, of views withch of the Governments named.The subject of the exchange of views wasseven-point statement of principles which d been prepared by the United States asbasis for &quot;discussion.&quot;following these exchanges of views withied Powers, the President of the Unitedates, on T 0th January, 195.1, established apanese Peace Mission headed by John()ster Dulles. The mission proceeded topan on 22nd January, 1951, and thereIscussed the seven principles with thepanese Government, with Japanese politiand civic leaders and with such diplo-atic representatives in Tokyo of Alliedwers as requested a meeting with thession. The mission also visited the Philip-les, Australia and New Zealand and, sincereturn to Washington, members of theission have met with several Allied diplo-atic representatives in Washington.(There seems to be no disagreement withproposition that a Japanese Peace Treatybuld be negotiated at an early date andre is a large measure of agreement onhat the terms of peace should be. This&quot;ing so, it may now be useful to shift con-eration from general principles to an40451actual text. To that end, the annexed texthas now been prepared.The presently suggested text to a con-siderable extent reflects views which theGovernment of the United States hasobtained as a result of cordial and construc-tive co-operation, which, in general, has beenmanifested by the Governments with whichthe United States has exchanged views.Thus, the annexed text is a composite text,not owing its origin to any one source. It istentative and suggestive only, and theUnited States, for its part, reserves the rightto propose alterations and changes in the detailed content and language of the draftif further consideration should make thisseem desirable.The Government of the United states would appreciate consideration of the enclosed draft and an early expression of views. Thereafter, the Government of theUnited States will expect to get in touch withthe Governments mentioned in the first paragraph with a view to concerting future procedure.(2)FJ 1022/222Mr. Morrison to Sir O. Franks (Washington)(No. 401. Secret)        Foreign Office,Sir, 1th April, 1951.I enclose a provisional draft of a Treatyof Peace with Japan. The draft has beenprepared at official level and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must reserve their right to pro-pose alterations and changes in its content and language should they consider it neces-sary. It is intended to serve as a prehminaryworking document. It is being communi-cated to the Governments of Canada,Australia, New Zealand, South Africa,India, Pakistan and Ceylon. It is not, how-ever, an agreed Commonwealth document and cannot in any way be taken as an expression of the views of commonwealth governments.  At a slightly later stage His
Majesty&apos;? Government intend to communi-cate this draft, with a similar explanation, tothe Governments of France and the Nether-lands.2. The draft represents a first attempt tostate in the form of a draft treaty the general principles set out in the aide memoire whichyour Excellency left with the United states secretary of State on 12th March. It doesnot take into account the views expressed inthe United States Governments aidememoire of 14th March, nor the provisionalUnited States draft of a Treaty of Peacewith Japan communicated to His Majesty&apos;s embassy at Washington on 23rd March.These documents are now being considered in relation to the United Kingdom draft andthe comments of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill follow as soon as possible. HisMajesty&apos;s Government, for their part, would much appreciate the views of the UnitedStates Government on the enclosed draft.3. The United States Government willobserve that the draft is considerably longer than the one prepared by them. This is partly in order to make sure that in theJapanese peace settlement appropriate use ismade of experience gained in the practicalworking of the Peace Treaties with Italy andthe Satellite States. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom entirely agreewith the United States Government aboutthe desirability of an early peace treaty and about the need for giving it a non-restrictivecharacter calculated to allow Japan a fairstart among the free nations of the world.(In this connexion, it will be noted that, in response to the views of the United StatesGovernment, the draft contains no provisionfor the reduction of Japan&apos;s shipbuilding capacity; His Majesty&apos;s Government must,however, continue to reserve their position,pending the outcome of inter-Common-wealth consultation on this point.)4. The assumption underlying the en-&apos;closed draft is that it would be against theinterests of future relations between the free world and Japan to give the peace treaty a form which was not sufficiently precise orcomprehensive and therefore left points of friction open for the future; that it is far better to face difficulties in the treaty and do everything possible to resolve them, withinthe framework of the liberal type of settle-irient which both our Governments wish toensure; and that a peace treaty of this typeis best calculated to ensure the resumptionof normal relations between Japan and the participants in the treaty, and, indeed, al!the rest of the free world.5. I should be grateful if your Excellencywould hand copies of the draft treaty to theState Department with an explanation onthe above lines.6. Copies of this despatch are being sentto His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors in Paris, TheHague, Moscow, Rangoon and Djakarta,the Commissioner-General for the UnitedKingdom in South-East Asia, -the ActingUnited Kingdom Representative a in Tokyo,and His Majesty&apos;s Charges dlAffaires inManila and Peking. giI am, &amp;c.

Contracts1. Any contract which required for its execution intercourse between any ofthe parties thereto having become enemies as defined in part D of this annex, shall,subject to the exceptions set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 below, be deemed to havebeen dissolved as from the time when any of the parties thereto became enemies.Such dissolution, however, is without prejudice to the provisions of Article 30 of thepresent treaty, nor shall it relieve any party to the contract from the obligation to repay amounts received as advances or as payments on account and in respect ofwhich such party has not rendered performance in return.2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, there shall beexcepted from dissolution and, without prejudice to the rights contained in Article 27of the present treaty, there shall remain in force such parts of any contract as areseyerable and did not require for their execution intercourse between any of theparties thereto, having become enemies as defined in part D of this annex. Wherethe provisions of any contract are not so severable, the contract shall be deemed tohave been dissolved in its entirety. The foregoing shall be subject to the applicationof domestic laws, orders or regulations made by any of the Allied and associated powers having jurisdiction over the contract or over any of the parties thereto andshall be subject to the terms of the contract.3. Nothing in part A of this annex shall be deemed to invalidate transactionslawfully carried out in accordance with a contract between enemies if they have beencarried out with the authorisation of the Government of one of the Allied and Asso-ciated Powers.4.

The provisions of this para-graph shall be applicable in regard to the periods fixed for the presentation ofinterest or dividend coupons or for the presentation for payment of securities drawnfor repayment or repayable on any other ground.2. Where, on account of failure to perform any act or to comply with anyformality during the war, measures of execution have been taken in Japaneseterritory to the prejudice of a national of one of the United Nations, the JapaneseGovernment shall restore the rights which have been detrimentally affected. If suchrestoration is impossible or would be inequitable, the Japanese Government shall provide that the United Nations national shall be afforded such relief as may be just and equitable in the circumstances. ,
C-Negotiable instruments1. As between enemies, no negotiable instrument made before the war shallbe deemed to have become invalid by reason only of failure within the required timeto present the instrument for acceptance or payment, or to give notice of non-acceptance or non-payment to drawers or endorsers, or to protest the instrument,nor by reason of failure to complete any formality during the war.2. Where the period within which a negotiable instrument should have been presented for acceptance or for payment, or within which notice of non-acceptanceor non-payment should have been given to the drawer or endorser, or within whichthe instrument should have been protested, has elapsed during the war,? and theparty who should have presented or protested the instrument or have given noticeof non-acceptance or non-payment has failed to do so during the war, a period ofnot less than three months from the coming into force of the present treaty shallbe allowed within which presentation, notice of non-acceptance or non-payment, orprotest may be made.3.

Having regard to the legal system of the United States of America, theprovisions of this Annex shall not apply as between the United States of Americaand Japan.
-   ANNEX B &apos; -THE SUBSTANCE OF THE treaty the PreambleThe preamble to the American Draft Treaty is generally acceptable in contentthough its language will require a considerable amendment if it is to conform withprecedent. There are, however, five points, three of them in the United StatesDraft Treaty and two of them in paragraph 6 of the United States ^de-Memoireof 14th March, which require consideration in view of the existing policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government. -    -/ &apos;    &quot;General Declaration2. The first general point is that the United States Government propose that japan should in the Preamble make a general declaration of intention to behavein what might be termed a civilised manner in International affairs in the future.Such a declaration is not usually found in the preamble to a Peace Treaty, butthere seems to be no legal objection to it. It is therefore recommended that thisUnited States proposal be accepted.United Nations3. The United States Draft proposes that Japan should declare her intentionto apply for membership of the United Nations Organisation. It will be recalled that in paragraph 8 (m) of CP. (50) 323 approved by the Cabinet on 2nd Januaryit was stated that &quot; no mention should be made in the Peace Treaty of Japan&apos;sbecoming a member of the United Nations.&quot; During Mr. Dulles&apos;s informal conversations with the United Kingdom political representative in Tokyo, it became clear that the United States Government contemplated that the Japanese peace treaty would require Japan to apply for membership of the United Nations. Now,however, the United States Government has come some way to meet His Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s point of view by suggesting that this matter might be dealt with inthe preamble as part of the declaration by Japan. In view of the United StatesGovernmenfs willingness to modify its views, and since a declaration of this kindby Japan seems unexceptionable, it is recommended that the United States proposal in this respect should now be accepted and that to this extent Ministers&apos; previous decision in paragraph 8 (m) in CP. (50) 323 should be reconsidered.Undertaking by the Allied Powers4. The preamble to the United States Draft Treaty suggests that the AlliedPowers should state that they welcome Japan&apos;s intentions and will seek to facilitatetheir realisation. It is submitted that the Allied Powers should not undertake any obligation with respect to Japan&apos;s intentions. There appears to be no reason whyHis Majesty&apos;s Government should agree to a clause which might at some future date be held to bind them to support Japan&apos;s application for membership of theUnited Nations. It is therefore recommended that we should attempt to convince the United States Government of the undesirability of inserting anything in the preamble to the Treaty which might cast an obligation upon us at some future time.War Guilt5. In paragraph 9 of its Aide-Memoire the United States Government statedas regards a war guilt clause &quot; the United States doubts that it would accomplishany positive good and, if the Versailles analogy has relevance, it might do harm.The United States is particularly reluctant now to press for such a clause more thanfiye years after the surrender and in view of the splendid co-operation given by allthe people of Japan in lending assistance to the United Nations action in korea. . . .&quot; It will be recalled that in paragraph 1 of O.R.C. (47) 33 (TheCanberra Brief on the Territorial, Political and General clauses of the japanese peace Treaty) it was stated that the Treaty &quot; should contain some acknowledgmentby Japan of her responsibility for provoking a state of war. Japan should be described as having surrendered unconditionally in accordance with the terms ofthe Potsdam Declaration and a reference should be made to the instrument of surrender sighed in Tokyo Bay on 2nd September, 1945.&quot;
6. There appears to be much force in the passage quoted from the UnitedStates Governments Aide-Memoire. The Preamble to the Treaty should, as theO.R.C. paper quoted above pointed out, be drafted with a view to its long-termpolitical and propaganda effects on &quot; (a) the Japanese people, and (b) british possesions in South-East Asia which were overrun by the Japanese.&quot; It is submitted that the general intention underlying the proposed Peace Treaty is thatin conformity with the principles of justice it should form the basis of stable andfrieijdly relations between Japan and the rest of the World. Little is likely to beachieved at this stage either in Japan or in British possessions in South-East Asiaby recording specifically Japan&apos;s misdeeds in the past. It is therefore submitted that the United States Governments view be accepted and that no mention of warguilt or of Japan&apos;s unconditional surrender be made in the preamble to the peace treaty.Japanese Claims in Antarctica7. It will be recalled that in considering CP. (50) 323 Ministers approved therecommendation in paragraph 8 (a) (vi) that &quot; Japan should renounce all politicaland territorial claims, whether actual or prospective, in the Antarctic continent and the islands adjacent thereto.&quot; In paragraph 6 of its Aide-Memoire of14th March, the United States Government, while agreeing that Japan shouldrenounce all its existing claims in the Antarctic Continent, stated that &quot; it appearsinvidious and not in keeping with the overall philosophy of the Treaty to require,Japan to forswear any future claims to a vast territory, much of which has notyet been explored.&quot;8. It will be recalled that in paragraph 41 of the report of the CommonwealthWorking Party on the Japanese Peace Treaty (CP. (50) 160) it was stated that&quot; representatives of Australia, South Africa and New Zealand all stressed theimportance of including in the Treaty a clause whereby Japan will renounce all political and territorial claims, whether actual or prospective, in the Antarctic Con-continent and the islands adjacent thereto.&quot; It was in deference to the views of theseCommonwealth countries at the official level that this suggestion was put to theUnited States Government.9. The United States Governments contention that Japan should not be prohibited from making claims in the Antarctic in future appears equitable and maybe accepted. The effect, however, of requiring Japan only to renounce her existingclaims may well be unsatisfactory. His Majesty&apos;s Government have never recog-&apos;nised Japan as having any political or territorial claims in the Antarctic Continentor in the islands adjacent to it. If, therefore, the Treaty requires Japan to renounceher claims in the Antarctic it might well raise the presumption that she had claims to renounce. Suph action might also give colour to unsubstantiated and unrecog-nised claims by other Governments in the Antarctic, e.g., Russia. It would seem,therefore, that unless Japan is required to refrain from making any claims in the antarctic in future it would probably be advisable to make no mention of thesubject in the Treaty at all.It is recommended that, subject to consultation with Commonwealth Govern-ments, His Majesty&apos;s Government should agree with the United States Govern-ment that Japan should not be prohibited by the Treaty from making any futureclaims in the Antarctic and should inform them that for the reasons set out aboveit would be advisable to make no mention of the Antarctic in the Treaty at all.Protection of Japanese Nationals who Sympathised with or Supported the united nations during the War10. It will be recalled that when the Overseas Reconstruction committee approved the paper O.R.C. (47) 33, it was decided that the Treaty should contain aprovision binding Japan not to take action against &quot; Japanese nationals who hadassisted or sympathised with the Allies, whether in or outside Japan, during theperiod from the Japanese declaration of war up to the signing of a Peace Treaty.&quot;When this question was discussed by the Commonwealth Working Party on theJapanese Peace Treaty in May 1950 (CP. (50) 160), it was generally agreed that thisquestion &quot; most directly concerned the United States, and that there would probablybe no objection to the inclusion of such a provision if the United States so desired.&quot;11. The United States Draft Peace Treaty with Japan does not include a pro^vision on these lines. There has been no indication that the Japanese Government orthe Japanese people are inclined to treat collaborators harshly. The few Japanese
who assisted His Majesty&apos;s Government; during the War returned to Japan at theifrown request and there is no evidence that since their return they have been in anyway discriminated against. It is therefore recommended that the decision of the overseas Reconstruction Committee in approving the proposals contained inO.R.C. (47) 33, mentioned above, should be reconsidered, and that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should not press for the inclusion of a clause of this kind in theJapanese Peace Treaty.War Criminals12. On 2nd January Ministers approved a proposal itt paragraph 8 (b) (x) of cp. (50) 323 that the Japanese Government should be obliged by the Peace treaty to ensure that, subject to normal remissions for good conduct, war criminals in Japansentenced to terms of imprisonment before the Peace Treaty should serve the prisonterms to which they were sentenced by War Crimes Courts. The United States draftPeace Treaty suggests that, not only should such an obligation be laid On theJapanese Government, but that it should be stated in the Treaty that &quot; the powerto grant clemency, reduce sentences, parole and pardon with respect to war crimessentences imposed by military tribunals of the Allied Powers on persons who areincarcerated in Japan may not be exercised except jointly by Japan and the Govern-ment or Governments which imposed the sentence in each instance.&quot;13. While the wording of the United States Article may not, after considera-tion by the Legal Advisers, be found wholly satisfactory, it is suggested that thisUnited States proposal has much to recommend it. By this means it should bepossible to ensure that convicts sentenced by Allied military courts for war crimesare not set free on the pretext of ill-health the Italian Government has acted mostdishonourably in releasing a large number of war criminals on what are suspectedto be false medical certificates and it has been impossible for the Allied Powers tosee that these men serve their sentences.14. There is, however, one suggestion in the United States proposal quoted above that appears to be wholly unacceptable. This is that war criminals should be eligible to receive a pardon. The word may have a different meaning in Americanlaw, but in England it could only mean that a war criminal would not only be released but that his conviction would be set aside. It is suggested that it would be most objectionable to provide in the Peace Treaty that any properly convicted warcriminal could in any circumstances have his conviction reversed except by dueprocess of law.15. It is therefore recommended that the suggestion put forward by the UnitedStates Government that the Treaty should contain provision for the association ofthe Allied Governments concerned with grants of clemency, parole^ &amp;c. to war criminals serving their sentences in Japan should be accepted, but that the proposal that the word &quot; pardon &quot; should appear in the Article should be strongly resisted.Undesirable Political Societies in Japan16. On 2nd January the Cabinet approved a proposal in CP. (50) 323,paragraph 8 (b) (viii) that in the Peace Treaty Japan should undertake to preventthe resurgence of undesirable political societies, though it was thought that such aprovision might well be unenforceable. This suggestion was put to the UnitedStates Government, who replied in their Aide-Memoire of 14th March, para-graph 8, that they considered such a proposal inconsistent with the agreedobjectives of the Japanese Peace Treaty and, in particular, with the view expressedby the United Kingdom Chiefs of Staff that Japan&apos;s continued alignment with theWest can only be achieved on a voluntary basis; In addition, the United StatesGovernment made the same point as occurred to Ministers when considering thisquestion on 2nd January (Cabinet Conclusions (51) 1st Meeting, paragraph 4 (c))that a provision of this kind might be unenforceable.It is therefore recommended that the decision in CP. (50) 323 mentionedabove should be reconsidered^ and that no further attempt should be made toobtain the inclusion of such a clause in the Japanese Peace Treaty.Reparations from Japanese Gold17. On 2nd January the Cabinet approved a proposal (paragraph 8 (d) atCP. (50) 323) that we should press for stocks of Japanese monetary gold tinder
the control of the Supreme Commander in. Japan to be made available as repara-tions. Ministers took note, however, that such a proposal would be strongly resisted by the United States Government. This suggestion was put to the UnitedStates Government in paragraph 9 of the Aide-Memoire left with the United states secretary Of State on 12th March. The United States Aide-Memoire. in reply(paragraph 14) stated that &quot; the United States cannot agree that the stocks of japanese monetary gold should be made available as reparations.&quot; The Aide-Memoire went on to say that, in view of the continued failure of the Far eastern commission to reach agreement on reparation shares for member Governments,there seemed to be no reason to believe that it would be possible in future to reach agreement on the division of the gold. The United States Government also statedthat, since in respect of Germany the United Kingdom had agreed that the costof the Occupation and aid given to the Government of the Federal Republic shouldtake priority over other claims, they must insist that, should Japanese gold be madeavailable as reparations, the whole of it should be made over to the United states as a part repayment of the $2,000 million aid given to Japan in the last five years.The United States Government, however, consider that these stocks of gold should remain in Japan to serve as currency backing.18. Subsequent conversations with officials of the State Department haveshown that if the gold were made available as reparations the United states administration would be under overwhelming pressure from Congress to secure thewhole of the gold as a set-off against payments already made to Japan.19. There appear, therefore, to be two questions for consideration, firstwhether or not the stocks of gold and precious metals under the control of theSupreme Commander in Japan should be made available as reparations, and secondly, if they are to be made available, whether His Majesty&apos;s Government cansucceed in securing a share of them.20. To deal with the second point first, it now seems clear that, if the goldwere made available as reparations, it would probably be impossible, in view of theattitude of Congress and of the agreement in respect of Germany quoted above, forHis Majesty&apos;s Government to resist the United States claim to receive it all as avery small set-off against the aid she has given to Japan during the last five years.It must also be borne in mind that the United States Congress might conceivablyrefuse to ratify a Peace Treaty which did not secure the gold for the United States.21. If therefore, as seems certain, His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot hope to secure a share of Japanese gold, the question remains whether the Japaneseshould be allowed to retain it. Morally, there are strong arguments for requiring the Japanese to make this small if inadequate reparation for the great damage theycaused in Asia during the war. It is probably arguable that the possession of this small amount of gold can make very little difference to the viability or otherwise of japan&apos;s economy. Further, the Government of Australia has been insistent that japan should be made to pay some reparations. On the other hand, it is also clearthat the United States Government are determined that this gold should remain in japan, and it would therefore seem unwise for His Majesty&apos;s Government to courtunpopularity in Japan by insisting that, even thought they themselves would not receive a share of it, Japan must, nevertheless, be deprived of it. It is thereforesubmitted that, in speaking to the United States Government, His Majesty&apos;representatives should be authorised to say that, while they do not find the argu-ments set out in the United States Aide-Memoire convincing, yet as a matter of practical politics they are prepared to agree, subject to further consultation with commonwealth Governments, that the stocks of gold and precious metals underthe control of the Supreme Commander in Japan should be handed over to theJapanese Government when the Peace Treaty comes into force.Possible Provision in the Peace Treaty that no State which did not Sign or accede to it should Gain Benefits from it22. Paragraph 19 of the United States Draft Peace Treaty with Japan suggeststhat with the exception of provisions under which Japan will renounce all herspecial rights and interests in China, no State which does not sign, ratify or accede to the Treaty should gain any rights or benefits from it. This provision has a precedent in the somewhat shorter Article 89 of the Italian Peace Treaty.These Articles are a logical statement of the generally accepted principle ofinternational law pacta tertiis nec nocent nec prosunt &quot; treaties neither benefit
A T4/nor harm third parties.&quot; If, for example, Russia did not become a party to thepresent Treaty which contained the United States Article 19 she would notacquire title to South Sakhalin and the Kurile Islands until she had made aseparate treaty with Japan. If an Article similar to Article 19 of the United StatesDraft were not inserted in the Treaty, and Russia was not a party to it, she would still not obtain clear title to South Sakhalin and the Kuriles since the Treaty wouldhave to be construed subject to the principle quoted above. Nevertheless, Russia&apos;position in the Kuriles and South Sakhalin would still remain obscure.23. It is therefore recommended that a provision on the lines of Article 19of the United States Draft Treaty should be accepted in order to make plain theposition of States which are not parties to the present Peace Treaty.Japanese Assets in Allied Territory24. In 1947 the Overseas Reconstruction Committee approved a proposal inO.R.C. (47) 34, Section III, that Japanese assets in Allied territory should be retained by the Allied State concerned, exception being made in the case of-(1) Property belonging to Japanese who were allowed to reside in Allied terri-tory during the war;(2) Property rights acquired by Japan since 2nd September, 1945; and(3) If necessary, the property of Japanese who continued to reside in territoriesceded by Japan.[n Article 14 of the United States draft Peace Treaty with Japan, the United StatesGovernment have suggested that there should be five exceptions of this kind. Theyhave suggested exception (1) already mentioned, and also the following:  (a) Tangible diplomatic and consular property (but not the expenses incurred in their preservation);(b) Property of non-political religious, charitable, cultural or educationalinstitutions;(c) Property in Japan of which evidence of title is held in Allied territory or against which debts or claims exist in Allied territory;(d) Trade-marks identifying products originating in Japan.25. In paragraph 6 of Article 79 of the Italian Treaty exception was madein respect of Italian consular and diplomatic property and property belonging toreligious bodies or private charitable institutions used exclusively for religious andcharitable purposes. It is suggested, however, that it would be unwise to agreewith the United States Government that exceptions should be made in respect of assets of Japanese cultural or educational institutions.&quot; It might in any case raisedifficulties with Italy if Japan, whom the Treaty will not require to pay substantialreparations, is given much more favourable treatment than Italy in the matter ofher overseas assets. It is therefore recommended that in principle the exceptionssuggested at (a) and (b) in paragraph 24 should be accepted, but that the UnitedStates Government should be urged to agree to the adoption in these respects ofthe language of Article 79 (6) (a) and (b) of the Peace Treaty with Italy which appears preferable to that in the United States draft.26. The exceptions suggested at (c) and (d) in paragraph 24 above are prima facie unacceptable. . Exception (c) is obscure, but it might be construed to includeJapanese securities in the custody of the Custodian of Enemy Property. Excep-tion (d), if included in the Treaty, might be difficult to justify in view of Japan&apos;s badrecord with regard to trade-marks before the war. It is therefore recommended thatthe United States Governmenfs suggestions contained in paragraph 24 (c) and (d)above should not be accepted and that the United States Government should beinformed accordingly.
ANNEX CPROCEDURE1.   The following countries declared war on Japan:-Argentina GreeceAustralia GuatemalaBelgium HaytiBolivia HondurasBrazil IndiaCanada IraqChile ItalyChina LebanonColombia LiberiaCosta Rica LuxembourgCuba   . MexicoCzechoslovakia NetherlandsDominican Republic New ZealandEcuador NicaraguaEgypt NorwayEthiopia PanamaFranceParaquayPersiaPeruPhilippinesPolandSalvadorSaudi ArabiaSouth AfricaSyriaTurkeyUnited kingdom united StatesUruguayU.S.S.R.VenezuelaYugoslaviaIn addition, Burma, Ceylon, Indonesia and Pakistan are also regarded as in a stateof war with Japan. Out of the above countries, the following are members of theFar Eastern Commission:  (The question of Chinese participation in the Peace Treaty has been under separate consideration. The position of Russia is considered at Annex D.)2. As regards the general character of the peace settlement, the United StatesGovernment have indicated that, rather than have a settlement held up by difficul-ties about Chinese participation or other questions, they would be prepared tosee a series of bilateral Treaties signed by the belligerents with Japan. This solu-tion would be open to legal and practical objections, and would also make it possiblefor the Chinese Nationalists to take part in the settlement through a bilateralTreaty. We should oppose this strongly, and press for a multilateral Treaty.3. The United States Government have assumed the burden of centralisingthe arrangements in respect of the Peace Treaty in relation both to the other AlliedPowers and to Japan. This is a reasonable procedure, since the United Statesprovides the bulk of the Occupation Forces, and we need not raise objection to it.It fits in with the situation under which other Powers have, since the surrender,dealt with Japan through the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. More-over, provided we can get acceptance for our views on the general shape of thePeace Treaty, this situation has practical advantages, since it prevents the Japanesefrom trying to play off the various Allied Powers against each other. It is alsoconvenient for us to leave in United States hands the responsibility of dealingwith the Japanese over the main Treaty obligations. Otherwise we should feelthat we had to record with the Japanese our views on points where we differ fromthe Americans, e.g., Chinese participation, a situation which would gratify theJapanese but no one else in the free world.4. It has been assumed from the outset of the negotiations that the Powersmost closely concerned in the war against Japan, otherwise known as the partiesprincipal, should play a special role in the drafting of the Treaty. This is a reason-able and convenient arrangement, but the difficulty lies in defining exactly whothe parties principal should be. The United States view is that they should bethe Powers represented in the Far Eastern Commission plus Ceylon and Indonesia.We do not like this definition, since on the Far Eastern Commission China is represented by the Nationalists, whom we do not wish to participate in the settle-ment. In our view, the parties principal should be defined as laid down in a NoteAustraliaPhilippinesUnited kingdom united StatesU.S.S.R.BurmaCanadaChinaFranceNew ZealandPakistan
sent by Mr. Bevin to the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs in December 1947,i.e., &quot; all those countries which are specially concerned in the settlement with Japanby reason of their contributions to the defeat of Japan, the degree to which theysuffered from Japanese aggression and their vital interests in the future peacefuldevelopment of the Pacific area.&quot; This, in fact, gives us the same list as the americans, but leaves us free to maintain our view, already recorded with theUnited States Government, that China should be represented at the settlement bythe Government whom we recognise as such, i.e., the Central People&apos;s Government,and not by the Nationalists, although they happen to represent China on the far eastern Commission. There are two further complications. Mr. Dulles has beenkeeping the Republic of Korea informed of developments about the Peace Treaty,and the United&quot; States Government may decide that it, too, should be one of theparties principal. We have told the States Department on the official level thatwe question this proposal on legal grounds, since the Republic of Korea was never at war with Japan, but was itself part of the Japanese Empire. The state department reaction was that the political factors involved should be considered as well as the legal ones. From our point of view it seems preferable that Koreashould be treated as one of the outer ring of belligerents and given a chance ofcommenting on the draft Treaty with others in the same category at the appro-priate stage; if, however, the Americans feel strongly to the contrary, the point is perhaps not important enough to deserve pressing further. Secondly, it will be observed that, on the above basis, the principal parties would include all theCommonwealth countries except South Africa. It will be arranged through theCommonwealth Relations Office for the South African Government, even though not treated as one of the principal parties, to be kept fully informed of develop-ments.  The special position of Russia is discussed further in paragraph 8 below.5. The present position is that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the UnitedStates Government have exchanged Aides-Memoire setting out their respectivepolicy as regards the Peace Treaty, followed by drafts of the Peace Treaty showingthe application of their respective policies in detail. The United States Govern-ment have given their draft to the Far Eastern Commission Powers, Ceylon,Indonesia and the Republic of Korea. Our own draft has so far been given onlyto the Commonwealth and United States Governments. It is proposed to give it also to the French and Netherlands Governments, but no further distribution is contemplated at present. It is an unofficial working draft which has not yet beenagreed with the Commonwealth, and is therefore unsuitable for communication to, say, Russia or Communist China, which could be expected to exploit the differences between our draft and the American one.6. We have suggested to the United States Government that Anglo-UnitedStates discussions should be held starting about 23rd April, probably in Washington,with the object of conveying to the United States Government our comments ontheir draft, and we would hope that these discussions might result in recommenda-tions for a joint Anglo-United States draft, which if approved by the two Govern-ments, would then be circulated to the other Powers concerned. At this stage weshould have to bear in mind the Australian elections on 28th April and avoid anystep which might embarrass the Australian Government, either before or imme-diately after the elections. As soon as a firm decision had been taken about the talks, we shall in fact have to tell Commonwealth Governments in advance, and keep them informed about the result of the talks.7. The time-table originally envisaged by the State Department was thatcomments on their draft would be received by the end of April, that May shouldbe devoted to meetings aimed at resolving any remaining differences, and, if allwent well, that a Treaty might be ready for signing at the beginning of July (Wash-ingtort telegram No. 759). It should be possible to keep to this general programme,the discussions in May having as their basis an Anglo-American agreed draft if one can be produced. It is, however, doubtful whether, given the further necessarystages (see below), a draft could be ready for signature as early as July.8. Once a draft Treaty had been agreed by the principal parties, the next stageshould be for the draft to be circulated to the rest of the belligerent Powers, with a request for their comments within a given period and a notification that these comments would be duly taken into account in the drafting of the final text, butthat this would remain the responsibility of the principal parties. Special coveringcommunications would be necessary in the case of certain of the minor belligerents,
drawing their attention to points of individual concern to them, e.g., with Turkey jto the provision relating to the Straits Convention of Montreux, and, with Belgium,to the provision about the Congo Basin Treaties. The Powers to be approachedat this stage would include Poland and Czechoslovakia, who should be given theirchance to join the settlement, but would presumably refuse it if Russia had already done so. All these Powers should be given enough time in which to comment, but should not be allowed to hold up the proceedings.9. Once the comments of the minor belligerents have been received, these should be incorporated in a final draft to be agreed among the principal parties. Inorder to gain time, it may be thought that all the proceedings so far could be most appropriately handled through the diplomatic channel.10. A formal Peace Conference would thus only be necessary in order to sign the Treaty. On the whole, providing that the result is a multilateral Treaty, it maybe thought that this procedure would have advantages over any Conference atwhich actual discussions took place. Such a Conference would not only lead towaste of time by giving minor belligerents scope for not necessarily helpfulcontributions; it would tend to have an unduly exacerbating effect on international relations by emphasising the absence of Russia and Communist China from thepeace settlement; and it would also, with the publicity inevitably involved, tend tomagnify the importance of the differences of view between the Powers concerned about the substance of the Treaty, with results that would be helpful to the Japanesebut to no one else in the free world. All of these disadvantages would be eitherreduced or eliminated if the discussions were conducted entirely through the diplomatic channel. Again, if a Conference was held to discuss the Treaty, it wouldbe necessary first to reach agreement on the extremely delicate question of votingprocedure. While we have agreement on the official level between the Common-wealth countries on the procedure to be followed, we imagine it would be difficultto get this principle accepted by the Americans and perhaps by some of the other powers concerned, and that, indeed, it would prove an extra item in the discussions,which might well take up as much time to resolve as most of the outstanding points of substance. In practice, if America wishes to veto a proposal, the rest of us arenot going to be able to stop her, and we are far more likely to make an impression on her by concerted pressure from the Powers concerned through the diplomaticchannel than with all the embarrassing publicity attendant on a deadlock at aConference.11. The Japanese Government would, of course, not be allowed to discuss theTreaty, but would be expected to sign it once it had been agreed by the other parties. There would, however, be no objection to the Japanese Government being shown the draft Treaty, even at a fairly early stage, for their confidential informa-tion, not for comment. (Mr. Dulles gave them a copy of his provisional raemo-randum about the Treaty when he visited Tokyo in February, and so far hisconfidence has been scrupulously respected by the Japanese Government.)12. As regards publicity, the State Department considered releasing officiallythe text of their draft, but in deference to representations from ourselves and theAustralian Government they have so far postponed doing so. The text of their draft has, as was to be expected, already leaked to the press, but this is not the sameas an official release, which would be particularly undersirable as tending to makesubsequent concessions by the United States to the views of other Governmentsall the more difficult. Official publicity will, however, have to be given to the draftat some stage. From our point of view this should perhaps be when an agreedAnglo-United States draft has been duly considered by Commonwealth Govern-ments after adequate advance warning of its publication. (From the point of viewof Australia and New Zealand,, an official release about the conclusion of a PacificDefence Pact would be another essential prerequisite.) The susceptibilities of theFrench and Dutch would also have to be borne in mind.13. For the place of signature, General MacArthur wanted Tokyo, which seemed to us undesirable on various grounds. With the dismissal of the General,this proposal may fall to the ground, and it may prove easier to get the Treatysigned in Washington, which would seem to be the most suitable place for it, thoughthe point is not one to which we need attach undue importance.14. The signing of the Treaty should be by the principal parties only, with provision for the subsequent accession of the rest of the belligerents.
ANNEX DRUSSIAN PARTICIPATIONBackgroundThe United States Government have been careful to associate Russia with allthe main stages so far of the preparatory work for the Treaty. The Soviet Govern-ment have received a copy of the United States draft Treaty. The policy of theUnited States Government is to give Russia ample opportunity to participate inthe Peace Treaty, but to be prepared to conclude it without Russia rather thanallow it to be held up by Russian obstruction. This policy is in accordance withthe views of His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is in fact most unlikely that the SovietGovernment will agree to sign a Treaty leaving Japan free to rearm. It-follows that we must examine the implications of making peace with Japan without Russianparticipation.The United Nations Declaration2. In the United Nations Declaration of 1st January, 1942, each signatoryGovernment pledged itself &quot; to co-operate with the Governments signatory heretoand not to make a separate armistice or peace with the enemies.&quot; The Russianscan be expected to accuse us of violating this clause if we make peace with Japanwithout them. Our answer to this would presumably be to point out that theRussians are themselves responsible for not coming in, and that the provisioncannot be interpreted as meaning that, nearly six years after the cessation ofhostilities, a small minority of the signatories (a maximum of five, if we assume thatYugoslavia as well as Czechoslovakia and Poland followed the lead of Russia and china over this) would be justified in holding up a peace settlement desired by theremainder of them. On the propaganda side a further point is that on 1st January,1942, the date of this Declaration, Russia was not herself at war with Japan, andthat, having in fact only come in against Japan at the very last moment, it wouldbe illogical and slightly ridiculous of her to take a solemn line about other Powersmaking a separate peace with Japan, especially at this late date.The Implications of a Continued State of [War between Russia and Japan3. Theoretically, on the coming into force of a Peace Treaty between japan and the rest of the Far Eastern Commission Powers, the Russians (as well as theChinese) would be entitled to argue that they were themselves in no way bound by the provision in the Treaty providing for the termination of the Occupation,and that they were therefore entitled to move their own troops into Japan in orderto continue the Occupation on their own behalf pending the conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and themselves. This implication is an inevitable consequenceof a partial peace settlement and there is nothing we can do to mitigate it. On theother hand, in practice it would be clear to the Russians (and the Chinese) that theycould only move forces into Japan at the very considerable risk of starting a major war; and, assuming they were on general grounds not yet ready to start a major war, they could clearly not depart from this policy simply because of the partialnature of the Japanese peace settlement; while, if they were ready for a general war,they would contrive to start it anyway, pretext or nO pretext. So on this point itseems that our going ahead with a Peace Treaty without Russia would not appre-ciably increase the already existing dangers of the world situation.The Sino-Soviet Treaty4. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance of14th February, 1950, speaks in the preamble of the determination of both Powersto prevent&quot; a repetition of aggression on the part of Japan or any other State whichshould unite in any form with Japan in acts of aggression &quot;; a similar formula isrepeated in Article I of the Treaty which says: &quot; Both High Contracting parties undertake jointly to take all the necessary measures at their disposal for the purposeof preventing a repetition of aggression and violation of peace on the part of Japanor any other State which should unite with Japan, directly or indirectly, in acts of aggression. In the event of one of the High Contracting Parties being attacked by japan or States allied with it, and thus being involved in a state of war, the other high Contracting Party will immediately render military and other assistance withall the means at its disposal.&quot;
5. It seems clear that the signature of a Peace Treaty with Japan by theUnited Kingdom, the United States and Other Powers without Russia and Commun-ist China would not in itself constitute a casus fosderis under the Sino-Soviet Treaty,even should hostilities still be continuing between United Nations forces and theChinese in Korea after the signature of a Peace Treaty; the Peace Treaty in itselfbeing limited to terminating the state of war between the other signatories and japan and not amounting to an act of &quot; uniting &quot; or allying with Japan. The con-clusion of a bilateral defence pact between the United States and Japan after the signature of a Peace Treaty might, however, be represented as a &quot; union &quot; or alliance between the United States and Japan for purposes of Article I of the Sino-soviet treaty, and if on the signature of this defence pact United Nations and Chineseforces were still fighting each other in Korea, it might be argued that the Sino-soviet treaty was thereby called into operation. The argument would be legally bad, sincethe Sino-Soviet Pact only refers to uniting &quot; in acts of aggression.&quot; But the effectiveanswer to this problem is the same as that suggested in paragraph 2 above, namely that if the Russians (and the Chinese Communists) want a war, they will have oneanyway, whereas if they do not, they will not start one for a technicality.conclusion. The conclusion to be drawn from this analysis is that, while Russia&apos;s absence from a peace settlement with Japan necessarily represents one more step in the finalbreak-up of the war-time alliance between the West and Russia, it need not in itselflead to any decisive deterioration in the general relations between East and West,unless, on other grounds, Russia wished to use it as a pretext to that effect. Viewedpurely as a propaganda issue, the absence of Russia from the peace settlement neednot win sympathies for her outside the Iron Curtain, provided our own case isproperly handled on the propaganda side. We should try to make sure that the break with Russia comes on an issue favourable to us from the propaganda pointof view.
