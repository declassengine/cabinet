THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  May 1951SECRET ;v/,. copy no.31CP. (51)13110th May, 1951CABINETTHE sudan memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe wide gap which separates the Egyptian Government and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment with regard to the Sudan was described in paragraphs 18 and 19 ofmy predecessor^ Memorandum of 27th November last (CP. (50) 283). Mycolleagues will recall that, at their meeting held on 30th November, the cabinet agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not now depart from their policy thatthe Sudanese people must be allowed freely to decide their own future, and that no attempt should be made to re-open negotiations with the Egyptian government about the future of the Sudan (CM. (50) 79th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo was accordingly instructed, when he submitted our defence proposals, to inform the Egyptian Government that HisMajesty&apos;s Governments objective in the Sudan remains that the Sudanese shouldbe enabled to attain self-government at the earliest practicable opportunity and thatthey cannot accept the validity of the Egyptian Governments view that the questionof the Sudan is inseparable from that of Defence.3. The Egyptian Governments reply to our new defence proposals holds outlittle hope of compromise. We must therefore face now the possibility that our dis-cussions with the Egyptian Government may soon break down. If they do, Iconsider it most important that they should if possible, break not on the issue ofdefence, but, as in 1947, on the Sudan, where our moral case has already beenproved (in the debate at the Security Council in that year) to be strong. To bring this about, I consider that Sir Ralph Stevenson should now be given authority todiscuss the future of the Sudan on the basis of certain principles which I attach asthe Annex to this paper.4. These principles, which have been agreed by the Governor-General of theSudan, have been drafted in an attempt to define as wide a measure of agreement as possible between the Egyptian Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government.Even if the Egyptian Government accept them, there is nothing in them whichcould be regarded as constituting an alteration in the status of the Sudan or willendanger His Majesty&apos;s Governments objectives in the Sudan or the right of the sudanese to self-determination in due course. On the contrary, if the egyptian government accept them, they will commit themselves for the first time formally to His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy. If, however, the Egyptian Governmentrefuse to accept such a reasonable set of principles, the consequences are likely to prove most damaging to them in any future international debate about the Sudan.Acceptance, therefore, would give us some hope of Egyptian co-operation in respectof the Sudan in future, and refusal may make it possible for us to focus worldattention on the issue of the Sudan where our case is strong, rather than on defencewhere it is, perhaps, not so strong.5. I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Cairo should now be instructed to discuss the future of the Sudan with theEgyptian Government, on the basis of the Annex to this paper, and to invite theEgyptian Governments concurrence in the principles set out therein.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,10th May, 1951.40595
ANNEXStatement of Principles(a) In view of the dependence of both Egypt and the Sudan on the waters ofthe Nile and in order to ensure the fullest co-operation in expanding the supplies available and in sharing them, it is essential that the friendliest relations should linkthe two peoples.(b) It is the common aim of Egypt and Great Britain to enable the people ofthe Sudan to attain full self-government as soon as practicable and thereafter choosefreely for themselves their form of government and the relationship with Egyptthat will best meet their needs as they then exist.(c) In view of the wide differences of culture, race, religion and political development existing among the Sudanese, the process of attaining full self-govern-ment requires the co-operation of Egypt and the United Kingdom with the Sudanese.(d) The two Governments therefore agree to set up forthwith a tripartite cOm-mission in order to help the Sudanese towards the goal in (b) and to assist them in formulating their future Constitution.
