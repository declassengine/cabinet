OJ^M&amp;O; tsjtftiV   404CUi/iENT- IS THE- PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential&apos;P&apos;(51) 142 COPY NO. 31    .24TH MAY, 1951CABINETMEMORIAL- TO FIELD MARSHAL SMUTSMemorandum by the Prime minister have been approached by the Leaders of the Conservative and liberal Parties with a request that the Government should take the leadin erecting a Memorial to Field Marshal Smuts.2. I am in agreement with this view.    Smuts had been the out-standing Commonwealth Statesman for the past thirty years and his services to the Commonwealth in peace and war put him in a very special position.    There is not, I think, any danger of creating an undesirable precedent.3. There is already under way a proposal for endowing a Chair,at Cambridge, of Commonwealth Studies, the funds for which would beraised by a public appeal supported by the Leaders of the main political parties and other men in public life.4. It is suggested that a statue should be erected at Governmentexpense in Parliament Square.    There is a suitable site between thestatues of Lincoln and Canning.5. It would probably be desirable to set up a special Committeeto deal with the choice of sculptor, etc.6. If the Cabinet agrees with this proposal I would make a statement in the House at an early date.7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations and the Minister of Works have been consulted and are in general agreement with this proposal.C . R . A .10, Downing Street, S.W.1,24TH MAY, 1951.
