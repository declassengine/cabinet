ANNEXSECRET Prime Minister,Salisbury.PERSONAL17th May, 1951.Dear Mr. Gordon-Walker,The Cabinet here have on several occasions discussed the closer association Report.    We have, as you know, agreed that when it is pub-lished here it will be accompanied by a statement by the Government to theeffect that while they are not committed at this stage to the adoption of anyof the recommendations the Report has this Governmenfs commendationfor serious consideration by the public.    Northern Rhodesia and Nyasalandhave agreed on the same formula.We have not yet heard whether the United .-ingdom government proposes to make any statement when the Report is published.    In thecourse of a discussion we had today we all agreed that it would be of thegreatest assistance to us in Southern Rhodesia - as we know would alsoparticularly be the case in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland - if the report could, as far as the Africans in all three territories are concerned, be launched with His Majesty&apos;s Governments blessing by means of a statement by the Secretary of State.We know that Mr. James Griffiths is at present on a visit to EastAfrica and will not be back in England until about the end of May when weunderstand the Report will have further consideration.    Although we fullyrealise that there must be many considerations which must be weighed against each other one of the most important of these from our point of view is the need for a lead to be given by His Majesty&apos;s Government so as toensure that the Report is from all quarters given a fair wind.    The hope isthat it will be found possible, for instance, for the Secretary of State to saythat His Majesty&apos;s Government commends the Report as a suitable basis forthe closer association of the Central African Territories or for use as abasis for the consideration of this aim.    It might also perhaps be found possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to say that, at any rate in principle,the closer association of the Central African Territories is desirable.I should be most grateful for your views on these suggestions.    Ishould particularly be glad to know whether you think the Report is likely tobe commended by His Majesty&apos;s Government and that this will coincide withpublication because we should like to issue such a commendation to tiieAfricans in this country with the Report.As you know, over the 17 years I have been in office and have pressed for closer association I have never been in a position to say that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment was firmly in favour of this object.    When, therefore, I havebeen asked by His Majesty&apos;s Government what were the views of the peoplehere in Southern Rhodesia on closer association I have always had to answer that I did not know because without His Majesty&apos;s Governments blessing itwas impossible to get any further.With kind regards,(Signed)  G.M. HUGGINSThe Rt. Hon. Patrick Gordon-Walker, M.P.,Commonwealth Relations Office,Downing Street, London.
