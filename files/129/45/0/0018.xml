tit3SIS DOCU-MEN-T- IS T-HE PROPERTY OF HIS -BRITANNIC-MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)-CONFIDENTIAL31  .CP.(51) 93 COPY NO.4TH APRIL, 1951CABINETTHE STONE OF SCONEMemorandum by the Attorney-general  recently called for a report on the result of Police inquiriesinto the theft of the Stone of Scone from Westminster Abbey on the night of the24th/25th December.   I have to inform my colleagues that after a prolongedinquiry by Scotland Yard, evidence has now been obtained that the theft was committed by four individuals of whom three have made confessions fullyimplicating themselves (although not their confederates) and there is noadmissible evidence against the fourth.2. The evidence would appear to disclose a clear case of the offences of breaking into Westminster Abbey and of doing malicious damagetherein, in addition to an ordinary charge of larceny.   If proceedings were taken in respect of the two former offences alone, this might give lessopportunity for the conduct of the defence on propagandist lines.3. No evidence is available as to the present whereabouts ofthe Stone although there is some reason to believe that it has been broken intwo.   Certain national newspapers are believed to be in possession of as much,if not more, evidence than the Police.4. During a visit to Scotland at the weekend, I took the opportunityof sounding a number of responsible and respectable citizens in regard totheir view about the theft of the Stone.   The general opinion seemed to be todeplore the circumstances in which the Stone had been taken and to thinkthat it should be returned.   On the other hand, there was, I thought , an equallygeneral view that any prosecution of those who had been concerned in taking itwould create a widespread, strong and very hostile reaction in Scotland.5. A prosecution at this stage is not likely to lead to any return of the Stone and might, indeed, result in its final disappearance. I have myself^particular enthusiasm for taking proceedings in this case but, on the other hand,&apos; &apos;it is difficult to refrain from action when the clearest evidence is available asto the commission of what many people regard as a grave offence.   In thesecircumstances, I would be grateful to know whether there are any matters ofpolicy or otherwise to which my colleagues think I ought to have regard in    \deciding whether or not to institute proceedings.   It may indeed be felt that thematter is one upon which His Majesty should be consulted.H. W.S.Royal Courts of Justice, W. C. 2. ,4TH APRIL, J951.
