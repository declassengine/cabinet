THIS DOCUMENT IS THE   PROPERTY   QF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  May 1951SECRETCopy No. *31CP. (51) 1223rd May, 1951CABINETCLOSER ASSOCIATION IN CENTRAL africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and theSecretary of State for Commonwealth relations we circulate herewith, for the consideration of our colleagues, the Report ofthe Conference of officials recently held in London to consider the question of the closer association of the Central African territories of Southern Rhodesia, northern rhodesia and Nyasaland (Annex II). The substance of the Report is summarised in the following paragraphs. There is no question of committing ourselves at thisstage to a final view on the proposals of the Conference and we do not ask our colleagues now for a decision on the substance of the recommendations. But wedo recommend, for the reasons given below, that His Majesty&apos;s Government(1) should, if the other Governments concerned agree, publish the Reportfor general information; and&apos;(2) should, without being committed to acceptance of the proposals in theReport, commend them in general terms for the careful considerationof all the peoples concerned as embodying a constructive approach.We should, of course, propose to report further to the Cabinet when there hasbeen time for public discussion of the proposals both here and in the Territories.Review of recommendations of the recent conference. The question of the closer association of the three British territories in central Africa has been under discussion for many years. It has recently become more urgent; and last year it was decided to hold a conference of senior officials of all the Governments concerned, to re-examine the problem and endeavour to formulate proposals that might be generally acceptable. This was announced in Parliament on 8th November. &apos;, .3. The Conference took place during March. Its Report (Annex II), whichis addressed to all four Governments, was unanimous on all points. The Conferencealso agreed on the terms of a Confidential Minute, to be addressed by each team of officials to its own Government, setting forth certain considerations not suitablefor publication (Annex I).4. The Report (paragraph 35) reaches the definite and unanimous conclusionthat &quot; closer association between the three territories ought to be brought about,and that the need for this is urgent. The reasons for this conclusion are set forthunder the headings &quot; Economic &quot; (paragraphs 25-26), &quot; Strategic &quot; (paragraph 27),&quot;Communications&quot; (paragraph 28), ^Administrative&quot; (paragraphs 29-30),&quot;Moral and Social&quot; (paragraph 31), and &quot;The urgency of the problem&quot; (para-graph 32). In the Confidential Minute closer association is held to be the only effective means of countering the increasing pressure of the Union of South africa on the Central African Territories.5. While thus decisively recommending closer association, the Report adds:&quot; But in any scheme of closer association certain conditions must be fulfilled.Account must be taken both of Southern Rhodesia&apos;s self-governing status and ofthe special responsibilities of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomtowards Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Political progress for Africans mustbe maintained and Africans must be enabled to play an appropriate part,
J        -   - . - .      . -.  -   -2 &apos; -according to their qualifications, in the Government and the political institutionsto be established. At the same time, until their partnership with Europeans becomesfully effective, there must be adequate provision in the constitution for Africanwelfare and advancement. Finally, the unit of government which is established forthe Central African territories must be able to stand on its own feet economically;and it must be autonomous financially.&quot; The detailed recommendations in theReport are designed to satisfy these conditions. &quot; *, 6. The Report rejects amalgamation and recommends that association shouldbe on a federal basis; in paragraphs 35-45 it gives reasons for this and for the belief that on such a basis adequate safeguards for the interests of Africans canbe provided. Subject to these safeguards, the federal Government would have full responsibility within the sphere allotted to it under a Ministerial system and witha federal Legislature. The federal subjects would include defence, external affairs,immigration (but not land settlement and alienation), economic development plan-ning, customs, posts and telecommunications, railways, arid civil aviation. Theauthority of the Centre, however, would be limited to the specified subjects declared to be &quot;federal,&quot; and the whole sphere of government in all three territories would,apart from these specified subjects, remain with the Governments and Legislaturesof the territories constituted as at present. The Territorial subjects would include all those matters that are most closely related to the life of the African inhabitants:for example, African education, health, agriculture, land and settlement questions,local government and native administration generally, police, mines and labour.In respect of all subjects not made federal the relationship of each territory to thei United Kingdom Government would remain exactly ,as it is now and Africanpolitical development would go forward as at present in the two territories. (TheConference assumed that the federal State would come, and Southern rhodesia would remain, within the scope of the Commonwealth Relations Office, whileNorthern Rhodesia and Nyasaland would remain within that of the Colonial Office.There would be the closest consultation between the two Offices in all important^questions affecting Central Africa.) r7. Thus in all matters most closely affecting Africans existing safeguardswould remain unaltered and the control of the Colonial Office in respect of northern rhodesia and Nyasalarid would continue as at present. But in federal matters(efg.\ customs&apos; or railways) decisions would have to be taken affecting african interests. To meet this the proposals provide, in the federal field, for Africanrepresentation in the Legislature; for an African Affairs Board including an Africanmember from each Territory (with the duty of scrutinising all projected federallegislation which, if the Board considered it detrimental to African interests, couldnot be brought into force without the approval of the United Kingdom govern -ment); and for a Minister for African Interests in the federal Cabinet (with powerto defer executive action proposed by the federal Government, if he considered itdetrimental to African interests, pending reference to the United Kingdom Govern-ment who could, if they thought it necessary, refuse agreement to such action).The Minister for African Interests would be appointed and dismissed not-by thePrime Minister of the federal Government, but by the Governor-General acting inhis discretion and then only with the approval of the Secretary of State; the&quot;Minister would thus be responsible through the Governor-General to the UnitedKingdom Government.. 8. . To/secure co-ordinated planning over Central Africa as a whole, to minimise-friction between the federal arid territorial authorities, and to promotefrom the outset a habit of co-operation rather than rivalry, the proposals (para-graphs 53-^56, 70, and 77) provide, in the spheres of economic and developmentpolicy and of finance, for the establishment of consultative, machinery through jointfederal-territorial bodies.Our Conclusions and Recommendations ./ \9. For the reasons given in paragraph 4 above and particularly because of theneed to counter South African pressure, we are satisfied that closer association is. urgently desirable in the interests of the Territories (including those of the Africaninhabitants) and of the Commonwealth.  The scheme put forward appears to us&apos; to .be constructive arid workable;: whether it can be brought into force will dependph the reactions to it Of European and Africaii opinion in the Territories and tothat we will revert below. We do riot at present ask -our, colleagues for- decisions
on the specific recommendations; we will therefore confine our comments on these to certain points affecting the safeguards for African interests.10. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have special respon-sibilities towards the African inhabitants of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland,which they have an inescapable obligation to. fulfil. The safeguards proposed inthe Report are necessarily different, within the limited federal field only, fromthe existingmethods of exercising our responsibilities in respect of the two northern territories; but we see no reason why they should not be effective. And it isnoteworthy that they would apply to the Africans in Southern Rhodesia, whowould thus acquire, again in the federal field, safeguards which they have not now.11. The linchpin of the proposed federal safeguards is the &quot;Minister for african Interests.&quot; Though a member of the federal Cabinet, and appointedto it as a Member of the federal Parliament (from those nominated thereto torepresent African interests), he would be outside the ordinary political field andwould be appointed with the approval of, and be ultimately responsible to, theUnited Kingdom Government. The arrangement is certainly unusual, but we dothink it Would be workable and we regard it as an essential part of the scheme.It is only by being within the Cabinet that the guardian of African interests couldbe fully effective; arid a Minister appointed-ostensibly to protect african interests-on ordinary party grounds would not necessarily be an adequatesafeguard.12. It. should be recognised that if the Southern Rhodesian Government agreeto the scheme recommended they for their part will be accepting, within the range of subjects proposed to be made federal, the reimposition (through the safeguardsalready referred to) of a measure of control from London which would amount toan appreciable curtailment of Southern Rhodesia&apos;;? present degree of independence.From their standpoint this would be a very severe concession which it wouldrequire a great effort to commend to their Legislature and contituents. HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would also.be making an importantconcession, although only within the limited federal field, in respect of our respon-sibility for Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland; but we should at the same timesecure powerful safeguards within this field for African interests. We should alsogain the acceptance by Southern Rhodesia of the representation of African interestsin the federal Legislature a most important and a new step for Southern Rhodesia!In the allocation of seats in the federal Legislature between the three territories,we understand that it only just proved possible with no margin-to find a basis that the.members of the Conference felt might be.capable of acceptance by theirrespective Governments. Indeed, it seems evident that, as regards the main lines of therecommendations, there is very little scope for manoeuvre, and that any attempt onour part to push the Southern Rhodesians still further would probably wreckany hope of securing a practical outcome,13. - Amalgamation being ruled out (paragraph 38 of the Report), the only formof closer association worth considering is federation; and it is therefore a choice between federation and doing nothing. If we do nothing, and so prevent theSouthern Rhodesians from linking with their northern neighbours, they will inevitably tend more and more to look southwards. The absorption of SouthernRhodesia into the Union would then probably be only a matter of time. If SouthernRhodesia were absorbed, Northern Rhodesia, through its geographical position andeconomic circumstances, would be exceptionally vulnerable to Union pressure andeventual absorption and it is most doubtful if Nyasaland, at present a backwardterritory, could in those circumstances stand out against encroachment by the Union.14. That the danger is real and urgent can be seen by a perusal of paragraphs.5-8 of the Confidential Minute. Afrikaner infiltration into both Southern andNorthern Rhodesia is proceeding apace at present the flow of immigration from-the Union is almost double of that frorh the United Kingdom. Not all the immi-grants from the Union are Afrikaners, and not alj, the Afrikaners have strong politicalviev7s;.but those who do obviously form a base for the extension of NationalistSouth African influence! There has always been an appreciable minority bodyof opinion in Southern Rhodesia which would not be averse from incorporation&quot;into the Union, and indeed we have just heard from Southern Rhodesia of a reportedmovement there for the formation (under local Afrikaner auspices) of a new political party with incorporation as its main plank. The rejection of closer association-would enable this party to increase its influence. /        ;
: 15:: Our task must in fact be to take every possible step to induce SouthernRhodesia to look northwards rather than southwards and to strengthen those in southern Rhodesia who favour a more liberal policy towards Africans. much progress has been made by Southern Rhodesia in recent years in services for thebenefit of Africans and a more liberal attitude is developing, particularly amongsettlers from this country since the war; we must do everything we can to encouragethis process.-In the absence of an organised African public opinion in central africa, the most effective counter to Union influence is the attachment to the british connection of a large section of the Europeans in all three Territories. By forginga constitutional link between them and creating a strong Central African block weshall at once put Central Africa in a better position to resist Union pressure and strengthen the British connection.16. Economically the Union overshadows Central Africa, and if the central african territories were to encounter a serious slump in production or the export oftheir products the danger of the economic attraction to and pressure from theUnion would be aggravated. A Central African block, forming a strong economic unit, would be in a better position to resist this pressure than three separate units.17. It will be a difficult and delicate matter to enable these vital considerations to play a part in convincing Parliamentary and public opinion here of the need forpositive action to keep Southern Rhodesia out of the Union. They cannot well be stated publicly by United Kingdom Ministers. We shall have, by one indirectmeans or another, to endeavour to bring them to the notice of influential quarters inthe Press and of others, including certain members of the Parliamentary LabourParty, who will seek to lead public opinion. &quot;We must aim at persuading those whoare concerned for the welfare pf Africans that if we d6 nothing-with the consequence of driving Southern Rhodesia into the Union we are likely to expose the welfare of the Africans to much greater dangers than any that may arise fromthe pursuit of closer association, specially if the latter includes the important safe-guards embodied.in the Conference^ proposals.18. The Governments concerned, including our own, have given assurances that before any decision is taken to bring about closer association adequate oppor-:tunity will be afforded for public discussion of any proposals that may be putforward. This can only be done on the basis of a set of concrete proposals. Forthis reason the Conference has framed its Report in a form suitable for publication.We recommend that, if (as expected) the other Governments agree, the report should be published here for general information in the form of a White Paper earlyin June, shortly after the Secretary of State for the Colonies returns from East Africa.(Two separate documents thatj?rovide relevant background-a factual survey of the territories and a comparative survey of native policy would be published at thesame time.)19. In addition to publishing the Report, we consider that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should also (on the broad lines of the draft statement at Annex III)commend it in general terms for the careful consideration of all the peoplesconcerned as embodying a constructive approach. As no decisions would be taken until after public reactions have been obtained, this would in no wise conflict withour undertakings.20. In the- public discussion of the proposals in Central Africa the crucialfactors are likely to be the attitude of Europeans in Southern Rhodesia and of africans in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland; the latter is bound powerfully to affect the reaction in this country and in Parliament. Vocal African opinion in thenorthern. Territories has expressed itself as opposed to closer association with southern Rhodesia and the conference recognised (paragraph 20) that this is aserious obstacle to closer association. But the Conference took the view that inthe last resort the African reaction hi the northern Territories would depend on thenature of the scheme put forward. They thought it unlikely that Africans would withdraw their opposition to amalgamation, but they felt that, provided that some form of closer association could be designed containing adequate provision for african representation and adequate protection for African interests and providedthat the services more intimately affecting the daily life of Africans were outsidethe scope of a federal Government, Africans might well come to realise the very substantial advantages of closer association from their point of view.
t 21., It is fairly certain that Africans do not - at present realise;&apos; that it is only by setting up a strong Central Africanblock that Union influence, which they greatlyfear,:Can.be effectively countered. It is clearly most desirable that -before HisMajesty^s Government in the United Kingdom have to make final decisions * theyShould&apos; be ;fully aware of African opinion in the northern Territories; it is equallydesirable that there should be opportunity for full discussion of, the; proposalsbetween-representatives of His Majesty&apos;^Government in,the United Kingdom and;Africans in the northern Territories arid-,Europeans, as well, of course, as thethree Central African Governments. The matter is of such importance to central africa and the: Commonwealth as a whole that we think that, if this proves practic-able, we should both proceed to Central Africa during the summer,recess after therehas been sufficient time for consideration of the proposals by the public for thepurpose of such discussions. A Conference could then be held in which we shouldtake part and which would settle the form of the proposals which the governments would formally sponsor for the consideration of the Legislatures and the public in central Africa and, of course, of Parliament here. The holding of such a Conference,whether here or in Central Africa, could of course only be decided upon with theagreement of the Governments concerned, and subject to the approval of our colleagues we propose to seek this forthwith. In our view it is most important thatthe intention&apos;-of holding such a Conference and if possible of a visit by ourselvesshould be referred to in the announcement accompanying the publication of theproposals; this would .discourage&apos; public .opinion in the Territories, whetherEuropean or African, from reaching premature conclusions, pending our visit,either for the acceptance or rejection of the proposals or particular features of thempending the opportunity of discussion with ourselves.1 ]       &apos; &apos; . .: :&apos;:  : &apos;:\:-:a      - &apos;    ,r*   J.rQ. &quot; &apos;.

ANNEX confidential CopyConference on Closer association in Central AfricaConfidential Minuteto GovernmentsCOMMONWEALTH RELATIONS OFFICE,LONDON, S.W.1,31st March, 1951.40408;
CONFERENCE ON CLOSER association in CENTRAL AFRICAMINUTETO THE SECRETARIES OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES AND for commonwealth relations on behalf of the United Kingdom members of the Conference we have the honour to submit, for the consideration of the United Kingdom Government, aReport embodying the views and the unanimous recommendations of the recent conference on the problem of the closer association of Southern Rhodesia,Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.Confidential Considerations2. The Report has been drawn up in terms suitable for publication if thefour Governments concerned agree that it should be made public. It consequentlydoes not fully report all the detailed deliberations of the Conference. In reachingtheir conclusions members were influenced by certain considerations which mightwell, if developed fully in a published document, be a cause of offence to theGovernment of the Union of South Africa. They also discussed freely and at length a variety of proposals for the future of Central Africa, but the full publica-tion of their discussions might result in confusing public opinion instead of focus-sing it upon consideration of the solution they wish to recommend. The Conferencefelt, however, that these matters should be brought separately and confidentiallyto the notice of the four Governments and they are therefore set forth in thefollowing paragraphs of this minute, which is in agreed terms and of which identicalcopies are being addressed to the other three Goverments by their own officials.It was, of course, understood by the Conference that the submission of the agreedminute would not preclude members from giving such further explanations of thework of the Conference as they might Wish to their respective Governments.Scale of Report3. The Report has purposely been made as brief as possible. We are anxious that those who will have to form a judgment upon it should be induced to read notonly the recommendations but the considerations leading up to them. In order there-fore to maintain a continuous thread we have relegated to annexes much of what might more conventionally have been in the body of the Report. Two documentsthat might have been added as annexes, namely the Central African CounciFs most valuable comparative survey of native policy and a comprehensive factual summaryprepared for us by some of our members, have been excluded. We assume that ifthe Report is published the factual summary will be published at the same time,and we think it essential that the Survey of Native Policy should also, with theagreement of the Governments concerned, be made public simultaneously. Werecommend that both documents should be published separately from the Report,partly because they would be out of scale if incorporated with it, and partly because we think that the Report volume should be small and therefore low-priced, so as tosecure a wide circulation among the publics concerned. -A cceptance of Closer A ssociation4. The. Conference had no hesitation in agreeing that in principle and for practical reasons the closer association of the three Central African territories was desirable and indeed urgently necessary. These three contiguous territories, withinthe dominions or under the protection of His Majesty, have a wide range of common interests and common problems. In many respects their economic needs and products are complementary. Closer association would enable them to utilise moreefficiently their capital resources in natural products, in man-power, in technicalskill, and in finance, with benefit to all the inhabitants of all races.    .The Danger to Central Africa5. The force of these Considerations has been felt for many years, but central africa is now exposed to a special danger which, in the view of the Conference,
makes it of compelling urgency that the three territories should combine in defenceof their way of life. The danger lies in the extension of Union influence over the rhodesias. The expansionist aims of certain Union politicians are well known.Allied with the alarming increase of Afrikaner immigration in recent years intoSouthern and Northern Rhodesia they are felt to constitute a serious and imminentthreat to the independent existence of the two territories. The motives behind this movement northwards may not be wholly insidious; economic ambition and thelove of adventure play a large part. The fact remains that the flow of migrants fromthe Union into the Rhodesias is now well in excess of that from the United King-dom. The ties of blood, and the Nationalist loyalties of many of them, will makethe migrants responsive to political intrigue and pressure from the Union. Manyof them show little inclination to become assimilated to the British way of life andoutlook that characterise the remainder of the European population. If early steps are not taken to slow down the movement the Afrikaner element (particularly inNorthern Rhodesia with its smaller total European population) will before longundermine the British way of life in these territories, destroy the progress that hasbeen made in both the Rhodesias in the economic, cultural and political advance-ment of the African, gravely prejudice race relations, and sooner or later lead to the absorption of the territories in the Union. In that event the future of Nyasaland would also be seriously jeopardised.6. Linked with this danger of infiltration is another danger. The facts ofgeography and communications render the Rhodesias uncomfortably susceptible to continue pressure from the Union. Any onset of economic depression might atonce make this pressure difficult for the individual territories to withstand; but thelarger and stronger unit resulting from closer association would be in a better position to offer effective resistance.7. The Conference was impressed with the gravity of the situation and felt it essential that there should be a strong British Central African Government, whichwould be better able to stand up to outside pressure than the territories individually,and which would remove the existing fears that internal pressure in any one of the territories might enable the Union Government to extend its political influence overthe area by a piecemeal technique. Acting in virtue of its own powers it couldenforce a common immigration policy for all three territories and could control immigration without the embarrassment which the United Kingdom Governmentwould experience in the field of Commonwealth relations. The Report makes clearthat federal control of immigration policy would not include control over land settle-ment and alienation. The problem of Afrikaner immigration and the suggestedmeans of dealing with it on a Central African basis are discussed at greater length in the Appendix to this Minute.8. In the view of the Conference the increase of the danger of penetrationfrom the Union if there is no closer association is imperfectly realised by africans in Central Africa and by public opinion in the United Kingdom. If the threat to both African and British interests were clearly recognised opposition in thosequarters to the closer association of the Central African territories would soon betransformed. The matter, moreover, is urgent. Delay at this juncture in establish-ing an effective scheme of closer association would probably be fatal to hopes of creating a British bloc in Central Africa, and the opportunity of commending sucha scheme to Southern Rhodesian opinion should be taken now, under the leadership of Sir Godfrey Huggins.Form of Association9. Convinced, therefore, for this and other reasons mentioned in the Reportof the urgent need for some form of closer association, the Conference examined with great care several proposals in order to discover the scheme which would be most effective and command the greatest measure of agreement. The proposalsconsidered were: the amalgamation of the three territories; amalgamation of partof Northern Rhodesia with Southern Rhodesia; a form of league; and a federalarrangement.Amalgamation10. The case for amalgamation as the most desirable and, apart from political considerations, the most practicable form of closer association, was stated withgreat force and clarity by the Southern Rhodesian members, who stressed the needfor a bold and imaginative approach. It was, in their view, essential that a strong40408 b 2
central government should be set up capable of inspiring the loyalty of theinhabitants of Central Africa and of defending the territories from the dangers thatthreatened them from within and without. Federal schemes were open to a variety of objections, e.g., complexity, cost in money and man-power, and relative weakness;amalgamation alone would ensure the full advantages of the closer association thatwas agreed to be necessary. The Southern Rhodesian members recognised the diffi-culties, notably opinion in the United Kingdom. The objections of Africans, they felt, could be faced and overcome; for example, examination showed that the nativepolicies in all three territories were much closer than critics had supposed. In their suggestions they incorporated a number of features designed to operate as safe-guards for African interests when His Majesty&apos;s Government divested itself of itsresponsibility.Rejection of Amalgamation11. The Conference, appreciating the sincerity with which the case foramalgamation had been stated, examined it with great care and sympathy.Members were impressed by the advantages claimed for amalgamation and by theendeavour made to meet its difficulties. On the other hand, it was equally stronglyargued from the point of view of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland that, giventhe different stages of material and political development of the territories,amalgamation in existing circumstances would not be the right solution. In anycase the Conference found itself forced to the conclusion that, despite the safeguardssuggested, there was no hope that, even with the utmost exercise of explanation andpersuasion, amalgamation would be accepted either by Africans in the northern territories or by Parliament and public opinion in the United Kingdom. that being so, to propound a scheme which was certain to be rejected in so many quarterswould set back indefinitely, all hope of forging a constitutional link between the territories; progress could only be made possible by recommending the mostpracticable scheme that had a reasonable chance of winning general assent.Amalgamation with the Copperbelt12. A scheme had been put forward in certain quarters for amalgamating with southern Rhodesia the Copperbelt and Line of Rail in Northern Rhodesia (theprincipal area of European settlement), leaving Barotseland and the remainder ofNorthern Rhodesia to be administered as native areas on the lines of the high commission Territories. The scheme was considered by the Conference and rejected without dissent; apart from the financial difficulties which it would createfor the non-amalgamated areas it was condemned as a scheme of vivisection, not of closer association; it was completely at variance with the policy of partnership between European and African; and it would be bitterly opposed by bothEuropeans and Africans in Northern Rhodesia.League13. Since amalgamation, despite its practical advantages, had to be excluded,the problem before the Conference was to decide what advance could be made towards an effective form of closer association without forfeiting the chance of acceptance by African and European opinion. One solution considered was theestablishment of some form Of league between the territories under which they-would set up machinery for co-operation in matters of common interest withoutsurrendering any part of their sovereignty or affecting the channels for the dischargeof the responsibilities of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom towardsthe Africans. Under this scheme there would be an inter-territorial organisation which, without disturbing the existing channels of responsibility, would provide-on the basis of delegated powers for the direction and administration of a specifiedlist of common services by means of a legislature elected by the territorialLegislatures, a small executive consisting of members of the territorial Cabinets orExecutive Councils, and a central secretariat and Departments. Assent to legisla-tion would rest with the three Governors.14. There was general agreement that this scheme would not prove satis-factory. There were grave doubts whether the cost of such a scheme would bejustified by the results or whether indeed it would really work. Not the leastdifficulty would be the establishment of an effective ministerial framework. Thecentral organisation would be weak and continually dependent on the goodwill of the individual territories. The Conference had to recognise that it would provide
no effective link between the three territories and would amount to little more thanthe shadow of a central Government that would fail to attract the respect andloyalty of the inhabitants of Central Africa. It might, indeed, prove a source of weakness rather than of strength. Southern Rhodesia would not be prepared to share its authority with such an organisation, and the Southern Rhodesian memberssaw no prospect of securing its acceptance by their Government and Legislature.A Federal Scheme15. The Conference then turned to consider whether a solution might notbe found on a truly federal basis. The problem was fourfold: -(i) could agreement be found for the inclusion of a sufficient range of subjects in the federal field to make it&quot;a reality;(ii) could agreement be foufid for a form of federal Government possessingsufficient power and authority to further the development and enhance- the prestige of the three territories;(iii) could adequate provisions be devised to satisfy Parliament and publicopinion in the United Kingdom that the discharge of His Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s responsibilities towards the African population in theNorthern territories would not be impaired;(iv) could these provisions be such as to be acceptable to the people ofSouthern Rhodesia, who have been self-governing since 1923.The Conference, while very conscious of the difficulties of the task, feels entitledto claim that these desiderata have been met by its recommendations.The Federal Field16. In devising the list of subjects which are recommended in its Report for inclusion in the federal field, the Conference was guided by the broad principlethat matters which closely affected the everyday life of the African should as faras possible be left within the control of the territories. These subjects, such as localgovernment, education, health, agriculture and allied subjects, would therefore remain the responsibility of the territorial Governments. Nevertheless, in additionto the minimum federal content of external affairs, defence and communications,a wide range of authority has been assigned to the federal Government, sufficient,in the view of the Conference, to make it an effective force for the protection andfurtherance of common interests in Central Africa.The Safeguards17. We believe, moreover, that in the possibly more difficult side of its taskthe Conference has succeeded in devising arrangements which will satisfy opinion in the United Kingdom that the interests of the African have been safeguardedand the discharge of His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs responsibilities assured. certain features which have been included in the scheme for this purpose will also, weconsider, make a positive contribution to the welfare of British Central Africa.That is, of course, notably the aim of the proposed Development Commission andthe Loans Council, which it should be noted would be joint federal-territorialinstitutions. The African Affairs Board is to include three Africans in its member-ship as well as the three Secretaries for Native Affairs, and in addition to the safeguarding of African interests its periodic meetings will provide a forum forthe discussion of common problems, leading, we believe, to mutual understanding and a closer approximation of the native policy of all three territories with results which cannot fail to be of benefit to Africans.The Minister for African Interests18. In the scheme of safeguards we attach special importance to the position ofthe Minister for African Interests who would also be Chairman of the AfricanAffairs Board. The definition of his status and functions was a signal example ofthe spirit which animated the Conference in seeking means whereby, without com-promise of principle, the proposals might satisfy the apparently conflicting require-ments imposed by the need for obtaining acceptance in different quarters.   While the
functions of the Board &quot;would provide a means of ensuring that legislation detri-mental to African interests should not be enacted, the United Kingdom.membersfelt that it was no less important to have a similar procedure with regard to theexecutive actions of the federal authority. This could only be attained by asso-ciating the Chairman in some way with the activities of the federal Cabinet. it seemed that the United Kingdom Government^ responsibilities would best be satis-fied if the Chairman were inside the Cabinet. He would thereby obtain a full knowledge and understanding of proposals discussed by the departmental ministers and would be in a position to make his views known before decisions were reached.The Conference therefore decided to recommend that there should be a Minister for african Interests in the Cabinet. He would have no departments operating underhim, and his independence would be secured by the provisions for his appointment and dismissal. He would admittedly occupy an anomalous position in a body whichin other respects would conform to the usual type of Cabinet Government; but theConference, after thorough discussion, agreed to accept the anomaly as justifiedand inevitable in the circumstances. In the recommendations which were eventuallyadopted everything possible was done to assimilate the Ministers position, con-sistently with his independence, to the normal requirements of parliamentary govern-ment by ensuring that he should be a member of the Legislature. It should be emphasised that as a member of the Cabinet it would be his duty, subject to hisspecial responsibilities for African interests, to co-operate with, and assist his cabinet colleagues in the conduct of the affairs of the federal Government. It isproposed that he should be drawn from the number of members appointed to theLegislature to represent African interests, i.e., from those who are nominated for thepurpose. This arrangement would avoid the difficulty which would arise if an elected member, responsible to his constituents, were appointed to the post. In theform of closer association of the Central African territories which we have recom-mended we can think of no more effective device for the protection of african interests, and we are confident that the efficacy of our proposal will be generally recognised.19. In conclusion we wish once again to record our sense of the urgent needfor bringing the Central African territories by some effective constitutional linkinto closer association with one another. Our recommendations offer, we believe,a solid framework for the purpose, and we think that they will be found to be in thebest interests of the peoples of British Central Africa. It is of great significancethat they have been unanimously agreed to by responsible officials of the three terri-tories who will have the duty of operating them if the new constitution is broughtinto being, and some of whom will be called upon to explain and commend them tothe African inhabitants. It is the earnest hope of all members of the conference that as soon as may be after receipt of the Report all four Governments will be ableto agree to the simultaneous publication of the Report for general information andto commend it for the favourable consideration of all the peoples concerned as afair and workable scheme. We believe in particular that nothing is better calculated to secure favourable reception of the Report by Africans than to have this measureof support from His Majesty&apos;s Government and we trust that their support mayreadily be made known.

APPENDIXIMMIGRATION POLICYPresent position at the present time immigration into Southern Rhodesia, Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland is subject to legislation and regulations which differ from territory to territory.. In all three territories, however, though to a differing degree in each,the immigration legislation and regulations have proved inadequate to solveimmigration problems which are common to the whole area. In particular, theyare not effective in restricting the numbers of Afrikaners included in the immigrants from the Union of South Africa, which represents a grave political threat to thefuture of Central Africa.2. The problem of Afrikaner immigration is at present much more serious forthe two Rhodesias than for Nyasaland, and probably more serious for Northernthan for Southern Rhodesia. In Southern Rhodesia, up to 1946, immigrants born in.the Union of South Africa outnumbered those born in the British Isles. Duringthe period 1946 to 1949 this trend was reversed and immigrants born in the british isles were in the majority. But in 1950 the old position was restored and Union-born immigrants were once more in the majority. In Northern Rhodesia imnu\grants born in the Union of South Africa have always since the war exceeded thoseborn in the British Isles and have also represented a higher proportion of the totalimmigrants than have those entering Southern Rhodesia. Detailed figures are asfollows:  Born inBritish Isles .South Africa.1938 1946 1947Southern Northern Southern Northern Southern NortharnRhodesia   Rhodesia   Rhodesia   Rhodesia  Rhodesia  Rhodesia1,2371,5346601,2633,5824,6549742,2216,3205,1041,4462,361Born inBritish Isles .South Africa.1948 1949 1950 (Jan.-Oct.llSouthern Northern Southern Northern Southern northern rhodesia   Rhodesia  Rhodesia   Rhodesia   Rhodesia  Rhodesia8,5744,4101,9902,3925,9085,1732,1973,1463,9597,0411,9293,360No reliable emigration figures are available, but it is known that a considerablenumber of immigrants from the Union do return there after a short stay in the rhodesias.3. It is not easy to determine how many of the Union-born immigrants areAfrikaners and what proportion of these are Afrikaner nationalists. A fairlyreliable guide is provided by the figures for membership of the Dutch ReformedChurch. In the 1946 census in Northern Rhodesia 18 per cent, of the entireEuropean population were members of the Dutch Reformed Church. In SouthernRhodesia in 1946 the proportion was 14 per cent., but it is now believed to be about16 per cent. In both territories there are now areas where Afrikaners are in themajority. There is, moreover, reason to believe that steps are being taken byNationalist organisations in the Union to encourage the emigration, to the Rhodesiasof persons of Nationalist outlook, though there is no evidence to show that theUnion Government are associated with these moves.4. Under existing legislation in force in Northern Rhodesia the Governmenthas Httle power to prevent anybody entering the territory unless lie falls within thenarrowly1 defined category of prohibited immigrant; and the powers, availablein Nyasaland are not much greater. In Southern Rhodesia the position is in severalrespects different. Not only can a potential immigrant be excluded on the grounds of his general undesirability, but all immigrants have to deposit or to have anemployees guarantee for  100, or have a private income of  500 a year; they must also satisfy certain health requirements. Furthermore there is a quota system foraliens.
Future proposals. The Southern Rhodesian Government are at present examining the subjectof immigration with a view to a possible restriction of immigrants from the Unionof South Africa and it is understood that they are inclined to favour the extensionof the quota systeni- They do not feel that they could apply it to the Union aloneof Commonwealth countries and it would therefore have to extend to all immigrants from Commonwealth countries except the United Kingdom; the intention is thatthere should not be any quota limitation on immigration from the United Kingdom.If criticised by the Union the quota,system could be justified by the argument thatthe Union itself operates such a system and on the ground of the general desirabilityof creating stability among the European population within Southern and central africa.6. The extension of a quota system of the kind now contemplated by theSouthern Rhodesian Government to the other Central African territories appearsto be the best way of dealing with this problem of Afrikaner immigration and alsothe most effective way of relating immigration to the absorptive capacity of the territories. There are two main reasons for this view. Other systems have beentried elsewhere and have not proved a success. Nyasaland, for example, has been working legislation on the East African model, under which a person can be refusedentry not only if he is shown to fall within the strictly limited class of prohibitedimmigrants, but also if his entry can be shown to be prejudicial to the interests of theexisting inhabitants of the territory. This is difficult to establish except in the caseof individual immigrants or persons in particular professions and it could not be usedeffectively to keep out persons of any given race such as Afrikaners withoutattracting embarrassing attention. Similar legislation was introduced into theNorthern Rhodesian Legislative Council over twelve months ago, but has never been passed owing to the opposition of some elected members. A second argument infavour of the quota system is that it enables a Government to operate an immi-gration policy to determine the composition of its population in the most positivemanner which can be devised.7. If a quota system is to be adopted for dealing with this matter in central africa, it will be much more effective if operated on a federal basis for the whole area than if each territorial Government has to operate it separately. First, asingle quota structure is easier to operate than three separate systems. Secondly,it is useless for the Southern or Northern Rhodesian Government to limit Afrikanerimmigration if the other Government is not taking the same action, since movement&quot; between the territories is not easy to control. Thirdly, since Union-born immigrantscannot be excluded altogether, the operation of a single Central African quota wouldmake it easier to reduce the influx of Afrikaners into those parts of the territorieswhere further settlement is not desired by counting against the full quota thoseAfrikaners at present essential to the economy of certain limited areas. Forexample, a certain number of Union-born immigrants are essential at present to theworking of the Copperbelt; this necessary immigration counting against a limitedquota should of itself do much to cut down the number of Union-born immigrants to be admitted to other parts of Central Africa. Fourthly, it would be easierpolitically for a Central African Federal Government to impose and operate a quota system than for Colonial Governments in respect of which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom still exercise full responsibility. Finally, northern rhodesia alone would have great difficulty in operating a quota system againstAfrikaners in view of their increasing influence in that territory.8. For these reasons it has been recommended in the Conference Report thatimmigration should be a federal responsibility. In making this recommendationpublic it would be important to emphasise, as the Report does, that immigration policy and regulation is quite distinct from land settlement policy, which under therecommendations in the Report would remain a territorial responsibility. Thealienation of land would be controlled by. the authority responsible for land settle-ment .(i.e., the territorial Government) and not by the authority responsible forimmigration.

Conference on Closer Association in Central africa to His Majesty&apos;s Secretaries of State for the Colonies and for commonwealth Relations, the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia, and the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland. -PREFACE1. The decision to convene a Conference of officials to discuss the possi-bility of formulating a scheme for the closer association of the Central African(territories of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland was announced in the House of Commons on 8th November, 1950, by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, Mr. James Griffiths.  Mr. Griffiths said : &quot; The question of the closer association of the Central African territories of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland has been underdiscussion for many years. His i.Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom have, after careful consideration, formed the conclusion that it isdesirable that there should he a fresh examination of the problem, and theyhave accepted the suggestion of the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesiathat a Conference of officials of the three Central African Governments, ofthe Central African Council and of the Commonwealth Relations Office and colonial Office shall be held in London for this purpose. It is intended thatthe Conference shall meet early in 1951.The officials will examine the problem in all its aspects and consider,whether it is possible, in the light of this examination, for them to formulateproposals for a further advance to be made in the closer association of thethree Central African territories which they could recommend to the Govern-ments of these territories and to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom. It should be emphasised that the work of the Conference will be purely exploratory and will in no way commit any of the participating governments to the adoption of any proposals that may be formulated bythe Conference. Full account will be taken of the special responsibilities of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom towards northern rhodesia and Nyasaland; and adequate opportunity will he afforded for public discussion of any proposals that may be put forward. This will include consultation with African opinion in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasa-land in accordance with His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs statement made in theHouse of Commons that full account will be taken of it before any changeaffecting African interests could be considered.&quot;Announcements on similar lines were made in the three Central African terri-tories.2. The Conference was held at the Commonwealth Relations Office,Downing Street, London, between 5th March and 31st March, 1951, and was attended by senior officials of all the Governments concerned. The conference was opened by Sir Percivale Liesching, Permanent Under-Secretary of State,Commonwealth Relations Office, and Sir Thomas Lloyd, Permanent Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office. Mr. G. H. Baxter, United Kingdom, waselected Chairman. A list of those taking part is given in Annex I.3. The work of the Conference was, as stated by Mr. Griffiths, purelyexploratory and the Report contains recommendations which we submit forthe consideration of our respective Governments. The decision whether therecommendations are acceptable rests with the Governments concerned. Theyhave undertaken to consult public opinion in the territories before reachingfinal conclusions.
CHAPTER ITHE BACKGROUND^)Geography4. The three territories he within the tropics but much of the land is 3,000-5,000 feet above sea level. In the highlands the climate is generally temperate,but during the hot season (October and November) temperatures may rise to100oF. In the plains of Nyasaland and the lower regions of the Rhodesias hotweather temperatures are much higher. Rainfall generally is confined to the &amp;kperiod from October to April and many of the smaller rivers dry out after the wrains cease. The only important navigable rivers are the Zambesi, which forms the boundary between Southern and Northern Rhodesia, and the Shire, which runs from Lake Nyasa through Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa to theZambesi.5. Southern Rhodesia has an area of roughly 150,000 square miles (about three times the size of England). The area of Northern Rhodesia is 290,000square miles and of Nyasaland 48,000 square miles, of which 10,000 square miles are lake.History6. Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia have a common origin, asthey were originally administered by the British South Africa Company, towhich a concession was granted by Royal Charter in 1889. Southern Rhodesiawas formally annexed and granted self-government in 1923, while the adminis-tration of Northern Rhodesia was transferred to the Crown in 1924. The exten-sion of European influence to Nyasaland was initially the result of missionaryeffort. Nyasaland was proclaimed a British Protectorate in 1891.Population7. In 1938 there were about 4,330,000 Africans and 76,000 Europeans inthe three territories. The total population of the territories in 1950 was estimated to be rather more than 6 million, of whom about 2,100,000 live in southern Rhodesia, 1,900,000 in Northern Rhodesia and 2,350,000 in Nyasa-land. Of these 169,000 were Europeans (Southern Rhodesia 129,000, northern rhodesia 36,000, Nyasaland 4,000) and 17,000 coloured (persons of mixedblood) or Asiatic. Territorial boundaries do not in all cases coincide withtribal boundaries: there is a continuous interflow of population between thethree territories and, in particular, very large numbers of Africans from Nyasa-land continually seek work in the other two territories. The growth in european population in recent years is largely accounted for by immigration.Physical Resources8. The physical resources of the three territories are to a great extent com-supplementary. Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia contain large areassuitable for European settlement and for temperate-zone agriculture andpastoral farming. Nyasaland has a greater proportion of low-lying land,thickly populated by Africans, suitable for sub-tropical crops such as cotton,tea, tung oil and food crops. All three territories produce large quantities of tobacco. The area as a whole is deficient in softwood timber, but there areC1) A fuller account of the background will be found in The Central African Territories:Geographical, Historical and Economic Survey, which is being published separately.
extensive hardwood forests. There are important mineral deposits in boththe Rhodesias, including gold, asbestos, chrome, coal and iron ore in SouthernRhodesia ; copper, lead, zinc and vanadium in Northern Rhodesia; and lime-stone in both territories. Nyasaland has few minerals. Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland have large fishery resources.National Income9. The combined national income of the three territories in 1949 was 113 million. Of this Southern Rhodesia contributed  73 million, northern rhodesia  27 million and Nyasaland  13 million.^Industrial Development10. The industrial resources of the area are considerable. The value ofthe net output of secondary industries in.Southern Rhodesia in 1949 was 20 million; in Northern Rhodesia (including copper smelting)  29 million.Important iron and steel and cotton textile industries are developing in SouthernRhodesia. Cement industries are developing rapidly in both the Rhodesias.Industries based on asbestos have been established and a pilot plant for ferro-chrome production is in the course of construction. A promising plywoodindustry is developing in Nyasaland.Transport11. The Rhodesia Railways system runs through the bechuanaland protectorate, Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia and is owned and operated jointly by the Governments of those three territories. The systemconnects the Rhodesias with the Union ports and Lourenco Marques (to theSouth); with the Beira Railway and the Port of Beira (to the East); with theBelgian Congo Railway system and Lobito Bay via the Benguela Railway(to the North-West). The Nyasaland Railways and associated railways arelinked with the Port of Beira via the Beira Railway and are thus indirectlyconnected with the Rhodesia Railways system. There is an extensive trunk road system connecting the territories, though surface standards in many areasrequire improvement. A continuing programme for development and improve-ment of the road system is in operation in all three territories. There is an efficient network of air services.Constitutional Status12. Southern Rhodesia has since 1923 been fully self-governing in domestic affairs, subject to certain reservations, particularly with regard to differentiallegislation affecting Africans. The executive power is in the hands of Ministerschosen by the leader of the predominant party, who are responsible to a singlechamber legislature elected on a common roll. His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom are responsible in the international field for the affairs ofSouthern Rhodesia and usually enter into formal agreements on her behalf.Certain agreements, particularly those relating to trade, are, however, enteredinto by Southern Rhodesia directly and the Colony generally deals direct with commonwealth countries and, in local matters, with neighbouring foreignterritories.13. Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland are Protectorates and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom, through the Secretary of State for theColonies, are ultimately responsible to the United Kingdom Parliament fortheir administration. Each territory is administered by a Governor who isadvised by an Executive Council including unofficial members; in Northern7
Rhodesia twoof these unofficial members are responsible forthe administrationof departments, and there are special arrangements concerning the weight to be given to the views of unofficial members of the Executive Council. TheLegislative Councils consist of official members and non-official members,including Europeans and Africans. In Northern Rhodesia the non-official members are in the majority, but power is reserved to the Governor to carry through by certification any measure required in the interests of public order,public faith or good government.Previous Consideration of Closer Association14. The Royal Commission under Lord Bledisloe&apos;s chairmanship, whichconsidered the question of closer association between the Central african territories in 1938, expressed the belief that the three territories would become more and more closely inter-dependent in all their activities, but did not recom-mend that there should be immediate amalgamation. The reasons why they felt unable so to recommend were: first, that the native policies of the twonorthern territories and of Southern Rhodesia were in an experimental stage and that it was too soon to say which of these policies was in the long run more likely to promote the moral and material well-being of the African inhabitants ;secondly, that there was general opposition to amalgamation among africans in the northern territories ; thirdly, that the European population of the three territories was not at that time ready, either in numbers or in experience, todischarge the responsibility of administering the combined territory ; fourthly,the differing constitutional status of the three territories and the fact that,whereas Southern Rhodesia was self-governing, Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland were Protectorates under an almost wholly official form of Govern-ment; and fifthly, the differing degree of economic development of the three territories and the relative weakness of the financial resources of northern rhodesia and Nyasaland. It is clear from their Report that the BledisloeCommission expected these obstacles to closer association to become less serious as the development of the territories proceeded. The Commission werenot in favour of the federation of the three territories because of their differingconstitutional status and different stages of social and political development;but the federal solution does not appear to have been considered by theCommission in detail.15. In order to secure closer co-operation between the three territoriesimmediately, the Commission recommended the setting up of an inter-territorialcouncil charged with co-ordinating the existing Government services and ofsurveying the development needs of the whole area. This recommendation wasnot implemented at the time, partly because of the outbreak of war. Butwar-time experience showed the need for the closest possible co-operationbetween the territories. Accordingly, in 1945 the Central African Council was established with the object of promoting the closest possible contact andco-ordination of policy and action between Southern Rhodesia, northern rhodesia and Nyasaland in all matters of common interest to the three terri-tories. The Council, which is purely consultative, consists of the governor of Southern Rhodesia as Chairman and four members from each of the three territories, including the Prime Minister and other Ministers from SouthernRhodesia, and the Governors, Chief Secretaries and leading unofficial membersof the Executive and Legislative Councils from the northern territories. TheCentral African Council and its Secretariat has achieved a certain success,particularly in arranging for the extension of a number of Southern Rhodesianservices to cover the northern territories when no such services existed there and for the creation of entirely new services on a Centra! African basis: but its
activities have been severely hampered by the fact that it is a purely advisory body and has no machinery for associating with it that public opinion whichmight have helped, as in the case of regional advisory bodies elsewhere, toensure that its recommendations received public support and were implemented.Those who have been most closely concerned with the working of the Councilbelieve that an advisory body can by itself do nothing further of value topromote collaboration between the individual Governments.16. As we have shown in paragraph 14 above, the factors whichhave in the past been held to weigh against an effective scheme of closer association are differences in native policy between the territories ; the opposi-tion of African opinion ; the small European population and the relative Jackof trained and experienced men ; differences in the constitutional status of the territories; and inequality in economic development between them. Duringthe past twelve years there have been substantial changes in the position.Native Policy17. We have had before us an up-to-date comparative survey(2) of native policy in the three territories, taking account of both theory and practice,and prepared in the course of 1950-51 by the three Secretaries for Native Affairsworking under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary of the Central AfricanCouncil. The information and conclusions contained in this highly authoritative-tive and objective report have been of great value to us in considering native policy a question which has always been recognised to be vital to anyexamination of the possibility of bringing about a closer association of the three territories. We have made a careful and critical study of this survey, and the detailed conclusions which we have drawn from it will be found in Annex II.18. The most striking conclusion which we draw from our examinationof the survey is the degree of similarity between the policy and practice ofthe three Governments rather than the degree of difference. The survey showsno differences between the policies pursued in the important spheres of educa-tion, health, agriculture, animal health and forestry as they affect Africans.The Southern Rhodesian Government have spent considerably larger amountson these services than the two northern Governments. In local governmentfor Africans in their own areas Southern Rhodesia has made less progress thanNorthern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, but it has for some time been aiming at thesame objectives so that differences which have existed in the past are becomingless marked. Differences of policy still exist in political development (particu-larly the representation of Africans in central politics), land allocation, certain aspects of the employment of Africans and the recognition of trade unions forAfricans. But we believe that these differences,. although important, relatelargely to method and timing and that the ultimate objective of all three governments is broadly the same, namely the economic, social and politicaladvancement of the Africans in partnership with the Europeans.19. We do not believe that the differences in native policy which still existcan now be regarded as a valid argument against closer association, providedthat a suitable scheme can be devised.  On the contrary, we think that thereCHAPTER II(i) THE POSITION TO-DAY(2) This is being published separately.
would be positive advantages in closer association from the point of view of native policy. Much serious thought has been given in recent years in all three territories to the problems of African advancement, and very considerableadvances have been made in Southern Rhodesia, where there has been a strongreaction against extreme policies elsewhere. With certain differences in thepolitical approach all three territories are now tackling the problems of Africandevelopment on broadly similar lines. Under a suitable form of closer association we believe that still further progress can be made in this direction to the great advantage of all communities in the Central African territories.Public Opinion in the Territories20. African opinion in the two northern territories and certain sections^of African opinion in Southern Rhodesia, for different reasons has expresseditself as opposed to amalgamation and indeed to any form of closer association.We recognise that African opposition in. the northern territories is a seriousobstacle to closer association. But in the last resort we believe that the judgment of African opinion would turn on the form which any scheme of closer association might take and on the range of subjects within the respon-sibility of a Central African Government. It appears unlikely that africans in the northern territories would be prepared to withdraw their oppositionto a scheme of complete amalgamation of the three territories. On the otherhand, provided that some other form of closer association could be designedcontaining adequate provision for African representation and adequate protection for African interests, and provided that the services more intimatelyaffecting the daily life of Africans were outside the scope of a Central african government, Africans might well come to realise the very substantialadvantages of closer association from their point of view.21. The majority of Europeans in Southern Rhodesia would, we believe,favour a form of closer assocation of the three territories which entailed theestablishment of a strong central government. In Northern Rhodesia, Europeanpublic opinion on the subject of closer association is difficult to gauge exactly,but it is thought that the bulk of European opinion in the territory would belikely to support some form of closer association. In Nyasaland Europeanopinion is less definite but has on occasion expressed itself in favour of closer association.Growth of Population and Increased Political Experience22. Since 1938 the European population of the territories has more than doubled. Africans have made substantial progress both materially and politically. The people of the territories have, in fact, gained political andadministrative experience and should have no difficulty in working a scheme of closer association effectively.Constitutional Position23. In the constitutional sphere both Northern Rhodesia and Nyasalandhave made substantial steps forward since 1939. Non-official representativesnow play a large part in the counsels of Government, and Northern Rhodesiahas a non-official majority on its Legislative Council. Both Legislative Councilsinclude African members. While the constitutional status of Southern rhodesia and that of the two northern territories still remain quite different, we believe it possible to devise a scheme of closer association taking account of thisdifference and providing for the effective operation of genuinely inter-territorialservices.
Economic Development24. Since 1939 the economic development of all three territories has goneforward rapidly and the financial position of the two northern territories, andparticularly Northern Rhodesia, has improved substantially in relation to southern Rhodesia. The advance which has been made is illustrated by thefollowing figures of Government revenue,(3) imports and exports, and national income, although it must be remembered in the comparison between 1939 andthe present day that the real value of the pound has decreased. SouthernRhodesia&apos;s revenue has increased from  3^ million in 1938-39 to  16^ million in 1950-51, Northern Rhodesia&apos;s from  ll million in 1938 to  14  million in1951, and Nyasaland&apos;s from l\ million in 1938 to  3 million in 1951. SouthernRhodesia&apos;s imports of merchandise rose from  9^ million in 1938 to  54 million in 1949, Northern Rhodesia&apos;s from  5 million to  21 milUon, and nyasaland&apos;s from  J million to  5^- million in the same period. SouthernRhodesia&apos;s domestic exports of merchandise rose from  10^ million in 1938 to 29-J million in 1949, Northern Rhodesia&apos;s from  10 million to  33 million and Nyasaland&apos;s from  1 million to  4^ million in the same period. national income figures are not available for 1939, but the national income of SouthernRhodesia is estimated to have risen from  46 million in 1946 to  73 million in 1949, while Northern Rhodesia&apos;s national income rose from  12 million to 27 million in the same period. Thus the national income of Northern Rhodesiahas been rising more rapidly than that of Southern Rhodesia. It is clear fromthese figures that rapid economic progress is being made by all three territories,that the inequality between them is growing less, and that their combinedresources, which are now far greater than they were in 1939, should be fully adequate to support a scheme of closer association.(ii) the need for closer associationEconomic25. Experience over the last decade has confirmed the need for co-ordina-tion of policy and action between the three territories in economic and develop-ment matters. Their economies are so inter-dependent that closer association between them in the field of economic planning is essential to remove thepresent causes of friction, still more so to secure the maximum economic development of the area as a whole in the interests of the people. It is mainly in the economic field that difficulties have arisen in recent years owing to the lack of inter-territorial machinery with effective power to enforce co-ordination.If economic policy can be effectively integrated and such economic barriersas exist between the territories can be broken down, the task of developingCentral Africa as a whole will be very much eased. In external economic relations Central Africa operating as a single unit would be more effective than the three territories operating singly.26. From the long-term point of view the economic future of the areacannot be regarded as secure so long as responsibility for directing its economyrests on three separate administrations. All three territories are reasonablyprosperous at present; but their prosperity has in a considerable degree beenbrought about by abnormal conditions which continue to obtain. A slump inthe price of tobacco, tea and cotton, or a serious falling off in the demand forchrome, asbestos and copper, would have a disastrous effect on the territoriesworking as isolated economic units. Clearly an economic crisis could be facedmore confidently if the units were closely integrated into an area having a widelybased economy.(3) The 1951 figures are, of course, estimates.
Strategic27. From the standpoint of both Commonwealth and local defence asingle unit would be stronger and more effective. A common defence policyis essential in an area whose communications and economies are so closely related.Communications28. The necessity for the closest association between the three territories in rail transport, the construction and maintenance of trunk roads and civilaviation (including meteorological services) is self-evident. All three terri-tories are land-locked and efficient communications with the coast are vital to the economic welfare of the whole area. These communications and the links between the territories must in our view be planned on a central african basis.Administrative29. Certain public services (e.g., posts and telegraphs) are similar in character in the three territories and their unification would secure greater efficiency. In some cases there is little chance of a service being provided atall on a territorial basis because of the relative lack of resources of the individualterritories ; if action is to be taken it must be on an inter-territorial basis. an example of this is the provision for Europeans and Africans of higher education,both academic and technical.30. At present separate territorial legislation is required in respect of ser-vices jointly operated, e.g., Rhodesia Railways. This is a cumbersome arrange-ment and what is wanted is a means of passing legislation in the form of asingle Act.Moral and Social31. The advantages which we consider would accrue to all communities inthe territories from closer association might appear, as we have set them out,to be related only to material development. We should not wish it to be thoughtthat the moral and social aspects had escaped our attention. Closer association would bring in its train a quickening expansion of the economy of the area asa whole and, therefore, greater prosperity ; this would, in turn, lead to an expan-sion of Government finance and, consequently, even though a particular depart-ment might not be brought within any scheme for closer association, to theprovision of better facilities for education (including community education),better health services (both curative and preventive), improved water supplies,housing and agricultural services, and improved social standards generally. Theneed for these improvements is felt by all communities, and in particular by the africans, who form the great bulk of the population. The moral and socialadvancement of Africans will march with the economic development of their countries and in our view the pace of such development will be slower if con-tinued on the present basis than if closer association is brought about.The Urgency of the Problem32. We consider that a crucial stage has been reached in Central Africa..European political development is already well advanced; and there is a growing political consciousness among Africans. The latter is in part a naturaldevelopment due to the improvement and expansion of the social and economicservices; but there can be no doubt that thinking Africans as well as Europeansin all the territories are becoming increasingly anxious about the course of native policy south of the Limpopo. We believe strongly that economic and
political partnership between Europeans and Africans is the only policy whichcan succeed in the conditions of Central Africa; this is fully recognised byHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and by all three central african Governments. Closer association between the three territories, by theeconomic and political strength which it would bring with it, would in purview provide a. surer foundation than exists at present for developing and extending the policy of racial co-operation and partnership, on which all three territories are agreed, without the fear of influences from outside the bordersof British Central Africa.33. Closer association would also provide the means of building upon an inter-territorial basis institutions which over a period of years would help todraw the Central African territories together in other ways. It would enableCentral Africa to determine the composition of its population by deciding ona common immigration policy; and the introduction of higher education for Europeans and Africans on an inter-territorial basis would help towardsthe creation of a common outlook.34. Having considered all these factors, we are agreed that, in the general interests of the Commonwealth and the particular interests of all inhabitants of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, there is a compellingcase for establishing an effective form of closer association between the terri-tories and that the need for this is urgent. But in any scheme of closer association certain conditions must be fulfilled. Account must be taken bothof Southern Rhodesia Y self-governing status and of the special responsibilities of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom towards northern rhodesia and Nyasaland. Political progress for Africans must be maintained and Africans must be enabled to play an appropriate part, according to their qualifications, in the Government and the political institutions to be established.At the same time, until their partnership with Europeans becomes fully effective,there must be adequate provision in the constitution for African welfare andadvancement. Finally, the unit of government which is established for theCentral African territories must be able to stand on its own feet economically ;and it must be autonomous financially.CHAPTER IIIform of closer association35. Having thus come to the definite conclusion that closer association between the three territories ought to be brought about, and that the needfor this is urgent, we have proceeded to consider what form the associationshould take. We have constantly borne in mind that whatever is proposed mustbe designed not only to promote the well-being of the territories and theirinhabitants but also to be.acceptable to the inhabitants and to the Governments. and Legislatures concerned.Proposal involving the division of Northern Rhodesia36. Before considering possible forms of closer association between the territories we wish to refer to a suggestion which has had some publicity that,instead of associating the three territories, the Copperbelt and line of railshould be detached from the rest of Northern Rhodesia and amalgamated with southern Rhodesia. This would involve turning the rest of Northern Rhodesiainto two separate Protectorates, one of which might possibly be absorbed intoNyasaland.13
political partnership between Europeans and Africans is the only policy whichcan succeed in the conditions of Central Africa ; this is fully recognised byHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and by all three central african Governments.

This would involve turning the rest of Northern Rhodesiainto two separate Protectorates, one of which might possibly be absorbed intoNyasaland.13
37. We can see no grounds for recommending this suggestion, and weobserve that in any case it would not achieve the objective of closer associationof the three Central African territories. The areas away from the line of railare intimately linked with the line of rail itself and the Copperbelt; they providethe labour supply for the industrial areas, which in their turn provide thefinance for. the development of the rural areas. While, no doubt, some arrange-ment could be made for the outlying areas of Northern Rhodesia to be subsidised under an agreed formula by the enlarged Southern Rhodesia, itwould be difficult, if not impossible, to adjust such a financial settlement as circumstances changed in the future. But there are more fundamental objec-tions to the proposal than this. The areas cut off from the line of rail would be incapable of any economic or political existence or development on their own 4&amp;and would in our view be condemned to continued stagnation. We have no^doubt that the arrangement would be strongly objected to by both european and African opinion in Northern Rhodesia.Solutions Rejected(i) Amalgamation38. One solution that has been before us is that the three territories should be amalgamated to form a unitary State, having a single Governmentand bi-cameral Legislature, with special safeguards for African interests andrepresentation of those interests in both Houses of the Legislature: the state to occupy in relation to the United Kingdom a constitutional position broadly similar to that of Southern Rhodesia at present. The separate governments and Legislatures of the three territories would cease to exist. Strong grounds of simplicity and efficiency have been advanced in favour of such a solution.On the other hand account must be taken of the fact that the territories are at different stages of political and economic development. Moreover, the elimination -tion of His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs present control over native policy in thenorthern territories would, we believe, be quite unacceptable to the great bulkof African opinion in the northern territories even with the insertion of the safeguards referred to above, and would fail to secure acceptance by theUnited Kingdom Government. After full consideration our conclusion is thata solution by amalgamation, although it has many intrinsic merits, stands so little chance of general acceptance that if only for that reason we. cannot recommend it.(ii) A League39. Another solution that has been before us is that each of the territories should retain its present constitution, powers, and status, and its existing government and Legislature, but that they should enter into a &quot; League &quot; towhich by agreement all three would hand over certain functions and powers,to be exercised by it on their behalf. The distinctive feature of this scheme.would be that the &quot; League&apos;s &quot; governing body and legislative organ would beprojections of the Governments and Legislatures of the three separate territories,and would exercise only a delegated authority. The scheme has been advocatedas largely preserving the existing channels of responsibility and authority. Onthe other hand, it would be difficult to work efficiently, would be liable to pro-duce friction and deadlock, and would not have adequate authority to securethe prosecution of constructive policies throughout the area. Moreover, webelieve that it would be quite unacceptable in Southern Rhodesia, where itwould be regarded as involving disproportionate complexities and hindranceswhile not substantially achieving for the territories the important benefits thatare the aim of closer association. After full consideration we recommend that
a solution of this nature should not be further pursued since it would be unlikely to work well in practice and in any case stands so little chance of general acceptance.Solution recommended: a federal system40. The solution that we recommend for adoption is that of a true federalsystem, on the lines set forth in Chapter V below. We believe that this wouldenable the territories to be knit together effectively for common action in thosespheres where it would be most beneficial to all of them, while leaving un-impaired the authority of the individual territories in spheres where this seemedmost appropriate, and recognising the responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom towards the African peoples. We suggest that thefederation might be called &quot; British Central Africa.&quot;41. Under our proposals the federal authority (and not the territorial)would exercise full control over a wide field of specified matters, especially those that transcend territorial boundaries or that concern the external relations economic and otherwise-of the territories with the rest of the world. Withinthe federal field the Government and Parliament of British Central Africa would(subject only to such checks and balances as we indicate in Chapters IV and Vbelow) have full responsibility and would in no way be subordinate to thoseof the territories.42. In respect of all matters not specified as being within the federal field,the authority and the constitutional position of each of the three territories andtheir relation to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would remain as at present, and in particular their Governments and Legislatureswould in no way be subordinate to those of British Central Africa. The manymatters that would remain within the purview of the individual territories would include all those that are most closely related to the life and ways of the Africaninhabitants, such, for example, as African education, health, agriculture, land and settlement questions, and native administration generally.43. We recognise, nevertheless, that action within even the proposedfederal field might at times impinge in some degree on African interests. our proposals, therefore, provide both for representation of Africans in the CentralParliament and for the vesting of special powers in an African Affairs Boardand in a Minister for African Interests. This Minister though a member ofthe central Parliament would be outside politics and would be appointed by,and responsible to, an authority, namely, a Governor-General who would himself be responsible for this purpose to His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom.44. In order to promote co-ordination of effort and harmonious workingbetween the authorities of British Central Africa and those of the three terri-tories, we have proposed in a number of spheres the establishment of consulta-tive machinery. We have no doubt that the increasing degree of intercoursebetween the territories would conduce to the same end.45. The scheme that we put forward is not a mere compromise betweendivergent views. We are united in believing that it has great positive merits inthe interests of all the territories and of all their inhabitants, and that it is fullyconsistent with the United Kingdom Government^ responsibilities towards the african inhabitants. We especially invite attention to our proposal to set upcertain new institutions (an African Affairs Board, a Development Commission,and a Loans Council) for which the association of the territories would providefull scope, and which we believe would be of inestimable benefit to BritishCentral Africa and to the people of all its territories.
CHAPTER IVgeneral principles affecting the federal scheme the Division of Functions46. In any federal association of States it is important that the divisionof functions between the central and territorial authorities should be as. clearcut as possible and that the central and territorial Governments shouldbe provided independently of each other with adequate sources of finance.The proposals for finance and recommendations for the division of functionsare set out in Chapter V below ; in those proposals we have, broadly speaking,allotted functions affecting the external relations of British Central Africa and services which transcend territorial boundaries to the central Governmentand legislature, and services which impinge closely on the daily life of thepeople to the territorial Governments and Legislatures.47. In accordance with this principle, defence, rail, trunk road and air communications, posts and telegraphs, broadcasting, the supply and dis-tribution of electric power, external and certain aspects of inter-territorialtrade, customs and medium and long-term research would be central functions.Local government for Europeans and Africans, native administration in all its forms, primary and secondary education for Africans, medical and health services, agriculture, animal health, forestry, game, fisheries and police services would be territorial functions. Since Africans are not at present appreciativeof the benefits to be secured by closer association, and since they are not yetqualified to play the full part to which they can eventually aspire in thefederal Government and Legislature, we have been particularly careful to reserve services which intimately affect&apos;African life and development to theterritorial Governments and Legislatures. Under our proposals the political development of Africans, both in national politics and in local government,would go forward as at present in the three territories.Constitutional Status of the Territories48. In framing our proposals we have had to take account of the factthat the three territories have a differing constitutional status and are at different stages of material development. In the constitutional sphere we havehad to consider how, without infringing Southern Rhodesia&apos;s self-governingstatus, to provide for His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs special responsibility forthe two northern territories and in particular for African welfare and advance-ment. We propose that the three territorial Governments and Legislaturesshould retain their existing status and powers within the spheres assigned tothem under the scheme which we put forward, the Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland Governments remaining responsible to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom. In the federal sphere the Government andLegislature of British Central Africa would have full responsibility with aCabinet system of government, subject, however, to the safeguards described in the following paragraphs. These safeguards are designed to preserve thespecial responsibility of the United Kingdom Government and parliament in respect of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland while not interfering withthe efficient working of the Central African constitutional arrangements.The African Affairs Board49. We propose that an African Affairs Board should be establishedconsisting, under its Chairman, of the three Secretaries for Native Affairs ofthe territorial Governments, one elected or unofficial member drawn from each of the territorial Legislatures and one African from each territory.  The
function of this Board would be to examine before publication from the pointof view of African interests all proposed federal legislation (both principal and.subsidiary) and to report thereon to the federal Government. Reference ofall such proposed legislation to the Board would be obligatory. At the timeof publication of a Bill the federal Government would be obliged to makethe views of the Board known to the Legislature in the form of a statement.If the Board reported that the proposed legislation would, in its opinion, be detrimental to African interests, it would be open to the Government to pro-ceed with it and the Legislature to pass it, but the Governor-General wouldbe required to reserve it for the signification of His Majesty*s pleasure and thematter would then be referred to the Secretary of State. The Board wouldalso hold a general watching brief in respect of all matters affecting african interests so far as they related to federal subjects and in addition it wouldhave the positive task of promoting liaison between the three territories in all matters affecting African affairs.The Minister for African Interests50. The Chairman of the African Affairs Board would be the Ministerfor African Interests in the federal Cabinet, who would be appointed by theGovernor-General from among the members representing African interestsin the British Central African Legislature. In making and terminating theappointment of this Minister the Governor-General would act in his owndiscretion, but subject to the approval of the Secretary of State. The Ministerfor African Interests would have the special function in the Cabinet of pro-posing any measures thought by him to be desirable in the interests of africans and of considering measures proposed by other Ministers to make sure that they were not detrimental to African interests. As a member ofthe Cabinet, it would be his duty, subject to his special responsibilities for african interests, to co-operate with and assist his Cabinet colleagues in theconduct of the affairs of the federal Government. Normally, agreement onany representations made by the Minister for African Interests would nodoubt be reached by the ordinary methods of consultation and discussion ;in a case, however, where it was found impossible to arrive at a solution andthe Minister for African Interests took the view that the executive action proposed by Ministers would be detrimental to African interests, he wouldhave the right to report this view to the Governor-General. The Governor-General would then be required to certify to that effect and to refer thequestion to the Secretary of State who would be able to give or withhold his approval. The proposed measure would not be carried out until the decisionof the Secretary of State had been made known, unless exceptionally theGovernor-General were to certify, after representation by the Prime Ministerbut on his own responsibility, that on grounds of urgent public necessityaction should proceed.51. These arrangements would have several advantages. The machinerydesigned to protect African interests would operate locally and theMinister for African Interests as a member of the federal Legislature wouldbe a local man with practical experience of conditions in Central Africa.Equally the members of the African Affairs Board would be men withpractical experience of the problems of the three territories. The presence of africans on the Board and their association with the Minister in his capacity as Chairman would ensure that African views were fully made known to theBoard itself and to the Central African Cabinet. The position of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom and of the United Kingdom parliament would be safeguarded by the requirement that, legislation considered detrimental to African interests should be reserved for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s
pleasure and by the right of the Minister for African Interests to secure post-ponement pending reference to the Secretary of State of any proposed executive action by the federal Cabinet which he considered detrimental to african interests. A fuller account of the proposed African Affairs Board and of the responsibilities of the Minister for African Interests is given in Annex III.52. It must not be supposed that the need for invoking these arrangements would arise except on the rarest occasions. We do not believe that the central african Cabinet or Legislature would proceed with action or legislation whichwas regarded as detrimental to African interests by the Minister for african interests or the African Affairs Board. In the case of differences of opinion asettlement would no doubt be reached by the usual process of consultation,the important point being that the machinery for consultation would be estab-lished locally. But the existence of these special arrangements would be a protection for African interests and, still more important, should give a sense of security to Africans at the present stage of their political development.The Development Commission53. In economic development Southern Rhodesia is the most advanced ofthe three territories and Nyasaland the least advanced. All three territories are engaged on extensive development programmes which have been drawn up after full consideration of the needs of the territories and for which finance andother resources have been earmarked. It is clearly necessary that these develop-ment plans should go forward, but there is everything to be gained from the closest possible co-ordination of development policies and programmes andwe regard it as of great importance that effective inter-territorial machinery should be established for this purpose. We recommend that there should be a development Commission composed of representatives of the central and thethree territorial Governments and Legislatures and that, working in the closest touch with it, there should be a Central Planning Staff, with the necessaryexperts, forming part of the appropriate federal Ministry.54. It would be the function of the Development Commission and theCentral Planning Staff to co-ordinate and keep under review the developmentneeds and programmes of Central Africa as a whole. The Central planning staff, with such assistance as might be required from the specialist departments of the territorial Governments, would carry out a complete survey of thedevelopment needs of Central Africa, taking into account the existing territorialdevelopment programmes and recognising that they would go forward, atthe same time indicating the gaps found in these programmes and the further development requirements. The Central Planning Staff, in consultation withthe territorial Governments, would also work out the extent to which the finance,personnel and supplies needed for development could be provided from theavailable resources of Central Africa as a whole. In so far as this was notpossible a combined statement would be drawn up of the assistance requiredin those respects from outside Central Africa. The responsibility for carryingout the various parts of the Central African development programme would hewith the territorial Governments as far as territorial departments were con-cerned and with the federal Government as far as federal departments were concerned. But the Development Commission and the Central Planning staff would be responsible for keeping the general execution of the programme underreview and for indicating from time to time probable shortages and variations in requirements for outside assistance.Central African Loans Council55. We believe that as part of the co-ordination of development planningthere should be complete co-ordination of Government borrowing from sources
outside Central Africa. For this purpose we recommend that there should beset up a Central African Loans Council, representative of the central and terri-torial Governments, similar to the Loans Council in Australia. The LoansCouncil would have the responsibility of considering the requirements for out-side loan finance put forward by the federal and territorial Governments. Werecommend that the members of the Loans Council should be of Ministerial or equivalent rank and that it should be empowered under the constitution to takefinal decisions on priorities between the central and territorial Governments andthe size of the loan programme, subject, of course, in the latter case to discussionwith His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom before seeking access tothe London market.Co-ordination of Federal and Territorial Economic Policy56. The Development Commission and the Loans Council would notbe purely federal bodies ; they would be joint federal-territorial bodies. Webelieve that, with the Tariff and Economic Advisory Committees, the establish-ment of which we recommend in paragraphs 70 and 77 below, they wouldprovide means for effectively co-ordinating economic and development policy ona Central African basis and securing the smooth working together of bothfederal and territorial departments concerned with economic matters. Inthis way the resources of the three territories can, we suggest, be most effectivelyharnessed to the task of developing Central Africa as a whole for the benefitof all its people. Taking into account the different stages of development inthe three territories it should in our view be one of the primary objectives ofthe development organisation to secure that proper attention is given to themore backward areas so as to ensure that they, along with the more developedregions, may play their full part in the economic life of British Central Africa.CHAPTER Vbritish central africa57. In Chapter III above we have set out the arguments which haveimpelled us to prefer federation as the form of closer association which hasmost to recommend it at the present time. We now give our recommendations on the nature and functions of the central Government of the federation.58. Our examination of this question has divided itself into two parts. Onthe one hand we have considered, one by one, the individual services and functions of government in the three territories to decide which are suitablefor unification and which should remain in the control of the territorial Govern-ments. On the other hand we have discussed fully the constitution and shape of the central Government, its Legislature, its Ministerial offices, and itsconstitutional relationship to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.In reaching conclusions on these questions we have kept in mind the following considerations.59. In the first place we have realised that if the advantages which we see in a federal system are to be achieved, the federal Government must have authority and prestige arid thus be able to act as a focus for a national loyaltyabove the local or provincial loyalties of the territories which comprise it. Itmust also have sufficient status to attract to its service, as Ministers or civilservants, men of the calibre needed to guide the federation in its early days.It is therefore essential that the federal Government should from its inceptionbe entrusted with a wide field of services and a high degree of executive responsibility.
60. Secondly, we recognise that, for the reasons set out in Chapter IVabove, those services which have a specially close relation to the day-to-day life and work of the African peoples should remain the responsibility Of the terri-torial Governments.61. Thirdly, we have realised that, in order to ensure that the federal government should not be dependent on the territorial Governments or Legis-Legislatures, it should have complete financial autonomy.62. Fourthly, we have borne in mind that one of the major arguments infavour of closer association lies in the benefits that would be derived fromgreater co-operation in the economic field.63.  Fifthly, we have avoided recommending unification merely for the ^sake of unification, recognising that some services by their nature are more suitable for local or regional administration.64. The services and functions which we recommend should become a federal responsibility are given in Annex V. All services and functions notspecified as federal would remain territorial, and it would not therefore be appropriate to specify particular territorial services or functions in the constitu-tion. The following outline of the main division of functions is given solely for illustrative purposes, the items listed as territorial being some of the moreimportant residual services and functions.FederalExternal affairs.Defence.Immigration.Economic Planning and Develop-ment.External and certain aspects of inter-territorial Trade.Income tax (federal).Customs.Census and Statistics.Railways.Civil Aviation.Trunk Roads.Electricity Supply and Distribution.Posts and Telecommunications.Broadcasting, Films and Tourism.European Education (primary and secondary).Higher Education.Medium and long-term Research.Surveys (other than Cadastral).Major water development.National Parks.TerritorialProvincial and Native Administration.Income tax (territorial).Agriculture.Forestry.Veterinary Services.Game.Fisheries.Co-operation.Marketing.Health.African   Education   (primary   and secondary).Labour.Mines.Local Government.Police.Prisons.Public Works (territorial).Roads (other than trunk roads).Irrigation (except major development).65. A possible grouping of federal functions and services into divisionseach of which might comprise a Ministerial portfolio is given in Annex VI.Functions of the Federal Government66. The main services and functions which we recommend should befederal are discussed in the following paragraphs. A fuller account of thefederal Governmenfs economic functions is given in Annex IV.
External Affairs67. A necessary element in a federal scheme is the surrender to thecentral authority of the powers of the federating units in regard to external affairs. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are responsible in the international field for the affairs of all three Central African territories,but certain international negotiations are conducted by Southern Rhodesia on her own behalf, particularly in the commercial sphere, and in relations with commonwealth countries and, in local matters, with neighbouring foreignterritories. We assume that in the control of the external relations of BritishCentral Africa the federal Government would have powers similar to those ofSouthern Rhodesia.)Defence68. We recommend that the federal Government should be responsible forthe military and air forces and establishments that are now the liability ofthe three territories.Customs69. We recommend that responsibility for customs and tariff matters. should lie With the federal Government and that a customs union should beestablished. Practical difficulties will arise owing to the different tariff systems of the three territories, the relation of these systems to the territories&apos; fiscalstructures and industrial needs, and to the fact that part of Northern rhodesia and the whole of Nyasaland lie within the conventional zone of the CongoBasin Treaties, within which discriminatory tariffs are not permitted. Webelieve that these difficulties can be overcome, but before a customs unioncan be achieved it will be necessary for all the questions involved to be dealtwith in detail by a committee representative of the three territories.70. We consider that it will be necessary to form a Tariff AdvisoryCommittee, representative of the three territorial Governments and the federal government, to make recommendations on tariff matters.External Trade71. The federal Government should be responsible for export, import and exchange control, exports promotion, and the negotiation of trade treaties.Inter-territorial Trade and Commerce72. We recommend that the federal Government should be given execu-tive responsibility for regulating the inter-territorial (but not the territorial)movement and distribution of locally produced or imported commodities whichare in short supply. We also recommend that the federal Government shouldbe given responsibility for legislation and executive action regarding com-panies,(4) insurance, banks (including land banks), bankruptcy, currency,patents, trade marks and designs.Development Commission and Central Planning Staff73. In paragraph 53 we have recommended that the planning of develop-ment for British Central Africa as a whole should be co-ordinated by a development Commission representative of the federal and territorial Govern-ments, working with a Central Planning Staff which would form part of theappropriate federal Ministry.  The functions of the Development Commission(4) This means the registration and administration of companies. It is not intended to alter the locus of companies for income tax and similar purposes.
are described fully iri Chapter IV above. Responsibility for the execution ofthe development programme would lie with the territorial Government or thefederal Government according to the subject. Industrial development wouldbe planned by the Development Commission ;.executive and legislative actionin connection with industrial development could be taken by the federal government if the industry concerned were one affecting two or more terri-tories, or by the territorial Government concerned if the industry were localin character.Loans Council74. We recommend that the outside loan requirements of the territorial and federal Governments should be co-ordinated by a Central African LoansCouncil representative of all four Governments. The form and functions which we propose for this Council are described in Chapter IV above.Census and Statistics75.   There should be a unified Census and Statistics Department.Research76. There would be great advantage in centralising the organisationsdealing with long- or medium-term research. This would not prevent individual -dual departments of the territorial Governments carrying out experimental orshort-term research projects.Prices and Wages Control: Subsidies: Rent and Building Control77. Control of prices and wages, subsidies, rent and building control should remain territorial responsibilities. Nevertheless, there should be close co-ordination of policy on these matters, and we suggest that this should be oneof the functions of the federal department responsible for inter-territorial tradematters. An Economic Advisory Committee representative of all three terri-tories and the federal Government should be established to assist co-ordination.Marketing78. All three territories have statutory marketing boards, whose task is topromote price stability and the expansion of production of particular commodities-commodities. We are agreed that in general these boards should at present remain a territorial responsibility, although the possibility of setting up federal marketing boards should not be excluded. Co-ordination of marketing policy should beachieved through the Economic Advisory Committee referred to in the previous paragraph.Electricity Supply79. The supply of electrical power is an important factor affecting develop-ment and economic activity, and we recommend that electricity supply anddistribution should be a federal subject. This would mean that the electricity supply Commission of Southern Rhodesia and any other Government electricity undertakings should be placed on a federal basis. It would not imply thatmunicipal or private undertakings should be acquired by the State.Irrigation and Water Supply80. Urban water supplies and small-scale rural water supplies should remain the responsibility of territorial Governments ; but we recommend that a federal department should be established to deal with major water control andirrigation schemes.
Transport and Communications m81. There are obvious advantages in unified control of transport and communications and we recommend that legislative and executive action inconnection with civil aviation, meteorological services, railways, trunk roads andposts and telecommunications should be the responsibility of the federal Govern-ment. Territorial Governments should retain their responsibility for local roads.European Education82. For the reasons already set out (in Chapter IV above) African educa-tion services at the primary and secondary levels should remain the responsi-bility of the territorial Governments. There would, however, be considerable advantages in unifying the European education services of the three territories,and accordingly we recommend.that a federal Department of European Educa-tion should be established.Higher Education83. There is clearly a great and urgent need in Central Africa for post-secondary education, academic and technical, both for Europeans and Africans ;but we do not believe it is possible for at any rate some of the territories toprovide the services themselves. It may be found that a university college aswell as higher technical institutions will be needed. We recommend that in thefirst place a small committee of experts should be appointed to assess the needson a Central African basis and make recommendations.Surveys84. The geological, topographical and trigonometrical survey departments of the three territories should be Unified.Town Planning and National Parks85. Federal departments should be established to deal with town planning and national parks.Immigration86. Immigration control, and legislation covering this, should be a federalresponsibility. But land and settlement policy should remain a territorialmatter.Miscellaneous Services87. Certain other services listed in Annex V should be made the responsi-bility of the federal Government which should also set up its own Treasury,Audit, Public Service Commission, Public Works Department, &amp;c.The Organisation of GovernmentThe Governor-General88. We recommend that the King should be represented by a Governor-General, who would assent to the Acts of the Legislature subject to HisMajesty&apos;s usual power of disallowance. The appointment of a Governor-General would, in our view, do much to promote a common loyalty betweenthe three territories which would, however, retain their individual territorialGovernors as at present.
The Legislature89. In our view a bi-cameral Legislature would be inappropriate to thepresent conditions of British Central Africa, where it would not be easy toprovide sufficient representatives to sit on three separate territorial Legislaturesand a bi-cameral central Legislature. In a federal system with a single-chamberLegislature, however, it would clearly be undesirable for any one territory tohave representation equal to or exceeding that of the other territories combined.We recommend, therefore, that the federal Legislature should consist of asingle chamber of 35 members, of whom 17 would represent SouthernRhodesia, 11 Northern Rhodesia, and 7 Nyasaland. Three of the repre-sentatives from each territory would be members specially chosen to representAfrican interests. In each of the northern territories two of these would beAfricans.90. The fact that the three territories are in different stages of political development makes it in our view neither possible nor desirable that themethod of election of members for the federal Legislature should at present be uniform throughout British Central Africa. The methods which we recom-mend for adoption in each territory are set out in Annex VII.91. The new constitution should provide for the reservation by theGovernor-General for His Majesty&apos;s pleasure of any bill reported by the AfricanAffairs Board to be detrimental to African interests. The Royal Instructionswould, as now, require the Governor-General to refer to the Secretary of Statebefore assenting to certain classes of Bill, e.g., those which appear to be incon-sistent with Treaty obligations or which affect currency.The Cabinet92. We recommend that in accordance with normal constitutional practice,the Governor-General should invite the member of the Legislature most likelyto be able to command the support of the majority to form a Government.As Prime Minister this member would, in turn, submit to the Governor-General a list of the Ministers he proposed to include in his Cabinet. We thinkthat a convention should be established by which the Prime Minister wouldselect at least one member of his Cabinet from each territory. All Ministersexcept the Minister for African Interests, whose special position is described in paragraph 50 above, would be responsible to the Legislature in the normal way. The exact number of Ministers would clearly have to be determinedby the Prime Minister, but we consider that an appropriate number would besix, including the Minister for African Interests. A suggested division of func-tions among the members of the Cabinet is given at Annex VI.The Civil Service93. We recommend that the Central Government should have its ownCivil Service with conditions of service and a promotion structure separate from those of the territorial Civil Services. The problems arising in connectionwith the setting up of the Civil Service are discussed more fully in Annex VIII..Judicature94. We recommend that the Rhodesia and Nyasaland Court of appeal should be the Supreme Court of Judicature for British Central Africa. ThisCourt would be responsible for deciding any question as to the respectivepowers of the central and territorial Governments, and we recommend that provision should be made whereby any other Court in British Central africa in which such a question is raised should refer the point by way of case stateddirect to the Court of Appeal.  We do not expect any serious difficulty to
arise out of the existence in the territories of systems of law differing to someextent, but we recommend that the federal Legislature should have power toprovide for proceedings by. and against the federal Government.The Minister for African Interests and the African Affairs Board95. We recommend the setting up of an African Affairs Board Of ninemembers under a Chairman who would be the Minister for African Interests.The composition of the Board and the powers and functions of the Boardand the Minister are described in Chapter IV above and in Annex ILLFinance96. Recommendations on financial arrangements are given in Annex IX.As the federal Government and the territorial Governments would be financiallyautonomous each would require its own finance department. The federalMinistry of Finance would be generally responsible for the raising of federalrevenue and the control of federal expenditure.97. On a rough estimate it has been calculated that expenditure on services recommended to.be a federal responsibility (not including railways)would be of the order of  10 million. We recommend that customs revenueshould be declared federal; the customs revenue of the three territories would amount in all to approximately  4J million. In addition there would be posts and telegraphs revenue of about  1^ million. We recommend that the federal government should be entitled to impose income tax. The territorial Govern-ments would retain their present right to impose income tax and to decidetheir income tax policies. We recommend that the Economic Advisory Com-mittee should co-ordinate income tax policy so as to ensure that neither thefederal Government nor any territorial Government took action which would prejudice the clear needs of any of the other Governments. Before the federal scheme came into force a fiscal conference, representing the three territories should meet to recommend the terms of a general financial settlement betweenthe federal Government and the Governments of the three territories.Citizenship98. There would be advantages in the institution of a common citizenshipfor British Central Africa although its introduction would encounter difficulties arising from the differing constitutional status of the three territories. Thissubject is dealt with more fully in Annex X. We have not thought it necessaryto reach positive conclusions in the matter and recommend that it should begiven consideration at a later stage.CHAPTER VIconclusion99. We have discharged to the best of our ability the task which wasentrusted to us. In the course of four weeks we have discussed in all its aspects the problem of the closer association of the Central African terri-tories. This would not have been possible in the time but for the provision to the members of the Conference before it opened of a comprehensive bodyof factual material prepared by officials of the Central African governments and the Central African Council. We are happy to have reached unanimousconclusions; our success in doing so is undoubtedly due to the sense which
all members shared of the pressing need to reach a practicable solution of central Africans major problem. . .\ .100. In our sketch of the federal constitution for the associated territorieswe have included no specific provision for its amendment. We do not, ofcourse, regard the structure as one which should be immutable, but when thetime comes as we hope it shortly will for establishing the federal Govern-ment we consider that Governments should indicate their intention that no major changes in the constitution should be made in the first five years of its existence. At some stage thereafter the detailed working of the scheme might require reviewing, but we suggest that the Governments should not commit themselves to any specific time for this.101. We would emphasise once more our very real sense of urgency inthis problem of bringing the Central African territories into an effective formof closer association. In order to assist our Governments in consultingpublic opinion in the territories we have drawn up our recommendations indetailed and concrete terms and in a form suitable for publication^Acknowledgments102. The members wish to express their indebtedness to ProfessorWheare and to say that it has been of the greatest value to have had con-stantly at the disposal of the Conference the immense knowledge and thepractical sagacity of one who is a pre-eminent authority on the science ofgovernment.103.

The conclusion to be drawn from the Comparative Survey of NativePolicyC) is that the ultimate aim of policy in each territory is to advance the african to the stage where he is in all respects a full partner, exercising allthe rights and accepting all the responsibilities of citizenship.2. Even in present practice there is much in common between the policiespursued in the three territories. For example, all territories are concerned withthe immediate economic and social advancement of the African, all are develop-ing local Government institutions such as native courts, native authorities andtreasuries, and all are following the same policies in education, health and agricultural development. There are, nevertheless, a number of differences,some of them important, as for instance, in the political sphere in centralGovernment (see paragraph (e) below), though they are essentially of timing ormethod of approach. These differences are as follows : (a) His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, through the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, has special responsibilities under treaty and otherwise for the protection and advancement of the African peoples of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, for whose administration HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is ultimately responsible to Parliament. In Southern Rhodesia full power is vested in the Legisla-tive Assembly and is limited only by the provisions relating to reserve powers.(b) In practice there is, in the northern territories, a considerable degree ofgeographical separation of the races, but their laws neither recognise norestablish this (save that in Northern Rhodesia Native Reserves are setapart for. the exclusive use and benefit of the Africans). SouthernRhodesia, by its Land Apportionment Act (described by the PrimeMinister when it was re-enacted in 1941 as an interim measure) has declared special European and Native areas.(c) Policy in the northern territories holds that in order to fit the Africanto take his place in the community as a full partner with citizens of amore ancient civilisation he must be induced to play a full part in thepolitics and administration of his own area and must play a direct partin the politics and administration of the whole territory. This is in the belief that without such political education there can be no assurance thatthe African would be able to play his full part in material and economic development.(5) This is being published separately (see Report, paragraph 17).
Policy in Southern Rhodesia holds that in order to fit the Africanto take his place in the community as a full partner with citizens of amore ancient civilisation it is first necessary to make him the equal ofhis future partner in health, material well-being and education. This isin the belief that without such advancement there can be no assurance that he will be fit to play a full part in the politics and administrationeven of his own area, let alone the politics and administration of thewhole territory.There is, therefore, an important difference between the policy of thenorthern territories on the one hand and that of Southern Rhodesia onthe other, though it is essentially one of method and timing, the ultimate aim in both cases being the economic, social and political advancement of the African.(d) Native Authorities and Councils are well established in the northern territories and have wide powers in local administration as well as financial and other responsibilities. In Southern Rhodesia, by statutethey have similar powers and responsibilities, but their general development has been less rapid and they have not progressed so far intheir use of these powers and responsibilities.(e) In Northern Rhodesia the African Representative Council and in Nyasa-land the African Protectorate Council select African members fornomination to the respective territorial Legislative Councils. (InNorthern Rhodesia Africans as British-protected persons are noteligible to be placed on the voters&apos; roll unless they become Britishsubjects, as they are entitled to do, as well as possessing the usualqualifications.) In Southern Rhodesia there are at present no african members of the Legislative Assembly, but Europeans and Africansshare a common voters&apos; roll. .if) In the northern territories Native courts have extensive criminal and civiljurisdiction. In Southern Rhodesia their powers are at present limited to civil matters only and exclude divorce.(g) In the northern territories African trade unions are legally recognised and given guidance. In Southern Rhodesia they cannot be registeredthough they are in practice given a hmited de facto recognition. In themeantime and until the Africans are considered ready* Works Com-mittees (on the Whitley Council pattern) have been set up and NativeLabour Boards have been established to which Africans either individual -dually or by Associations can put their case. Moreover, Section 87 ofthe Railway Employment Regulations formed under the southern rhodesian Native Labour Boards&quot; Act provides that &quot; the RhodesiaRailways African Employees&apos; Association shall be recognised by theRailways as an association representative of a section of the employees.&quot;(h) In Northern and Southern Rhodesia certain wage agreements made between European trade unions and employers&apos; organisations have inpractice created an industrial colour bar in certain spheres of employ-ment by laying down European wage standards. The result of these agreements is that the African is unlikely to obtain employment in thosespheres on account of the rate of wages which has been fixed.In Southern Rhodesia these agreements may receive statutoryrecognition under the Industrial Conciliation Act; in Northern Rhodesiasuch agreements receive no statutory recognition. In Nyasaland there isno industrial colour bar.(i) In Southern Rhodesia professional and technical departments of the division of Native Affairs have been established to provide separateservices for Africans. In the northern territories there are no separatedepartments dealing exclusively with African affairs (except that in
Northern Rhodesia there is ah.African Education Department for which -responsibility is at present exercised by the same Secretary as for theEuropean Education Department).(/) African registration and pass laws are broadly similar for indigenousAfricans in Northern and Southern Rhodesia. In Nyasaland there areno pass laws (save for the night passes under the Township Regulations),but non-indigenous Africans must register on entering the Protectorate.In Southern Rhodesia, which has a large immigrant African population,there are pass laws applicable to non-indigenous Africans which are more stringent than those applied to indigenous Africans in their ownterritories. Under present circumstances, these are in part necessary to implement inter-territorial agreements relating to migrant labour and g^.also in the view of the Southern Rhodesia Government they are in &quot;part necessary in the interests of good order. These differences are setout in greater detail in the Comparative Survey of Native Policy.(k)In the northern territories no legal or administrative restrictions are placed upon the employment of Africans in any post in the government service for which they may be suitably qualified. In those territoriesthere is at present a wider range of responsible posts occupied by Africansthan in Southern Rhodesia, where, in particular, Africans are not gener-ally employed as clerks, compositors, telegraphists or surveyors. ThePublic Services Act in Southern Rhodesia at present debars Africansfrom appointment to posts as defined in the Public Services Act, butconsideration is now being given to the greater employment of africans in clerical and manipulative work in the Public Service. In the mean-time should a suitable qualified African be available for appointment to a technical or professional post, a post would be created for him.There is no limit to Africans&apos; field of employment in their own areasor in the departments referred to in paragraph (z) as providing services for Africans.(0 The Southern Rhodesia Government spends considerably more per headof the African population on such African services as health, education,irrigation and soil conservation than do the northern Governments,although an exact comparison is not possible owing to overlapping ofEuropean and African services and, to a lesser extent, the varyingresponsibilities assumed for such services by local government bodies andby industrial concerns (as, for example, the mining companies).ANNEX m(Paras. 51 and 95 of Report)AFRICAN  AFFAIRS   BOARD   AND   MINISTER  FOR  AFRICANINTERESTSComposition of the Board1. The African Affairs Board would consist, in addition to a Chairman,of three members from each territory, one being the Secretary for Native Affairs,one an unofficial or elected member of the Legislature appointed by theGovernor of the territory and the third an African, also appointed by theGovernor of the territory.Functions of the board.  The Board would have three main functions:(i) To examine before publication, from the point of view of african interests, all proposed legislation (both principal and subsidiary) and to
report thereon to the federal Government. Reference of all suchproposed legislation to the Board would be obligatory. At the timeof publication of the Bill the federal Government would be obliged tomake the views of the Board upon it known to the Legislature in astatement attached to the Bill. If the Board reported that the proposed legislation would in its opinion be detrimental to African interests, itwould be open to the Government to introduce and to the legislature to pass it, but the Governor-General would be required to reserve it for signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure and the matter would then bereferred to the Secretary of State. In the case of subsidiary legislation, the Board&apos;s report would be referred with the draft legislation to&apos; theGovernor-General for transmission to the Secretary of State.(ii) To hold a general watching brief in respect of all matters affectingAfrican interests so far as they relate to federal subjects ; and inparticular to consider and report on any representations made to it by recognised representative bodies on any matter affecting african interests in the administration of the unified services.(iii) To promote liaison between the three territories in any matters dealingwith African affairs. The frequent meeting together of the variousSecretaries for Native Affairs and other members would in itself ensurediscussion and harmonisation of proposals.Special responsibilities of Minister for African Interests3. The Chairman of the Board would be the Minister for African Interestsin the federal Cabinet, who would be appointed by the Governor-General from among members representing African interests in the British Central AfricanLegislature. In making and terminating the appointment of this Minister theGovernor-General would act on his own discretion but subject to the approvalof the Secretary of State. The Minister for African Interests would have thespecial function in the Cabinet of proposing any measures thought by himto be desirable.in the interests of Africans and of considering measures pro-posed by other Ministers to make sure that they were not detrimental to african interests.4. It is to be expected that normally as a result of the above machinerydue regard would be paid in any federal matter to African interests and thatany initial difficulties would be removed in course of discussion. But if it were found impossible to arrive at a solution and the Minister were to take the viewthat any executive action proposed by Ministers would be detrimental to african interests he would have the right to report his view to the Governor-General.It would then be the duty of the Governor-General to certify to that effect andto refer the question to the Secretary of State. Thereupon the proposed action would not be proceeded with until the decision of the Secretary of State hadbeen made known, and the Secretary of State would be able either to giveor withhold his approval. It should, however, be provided that in case thePrime Minister were to report to the Governor-General that in his view it wasa matter of urgent public necessity that any proposed action should immedi-ately be carried out, the Governor-General would have the authority to certifythat, notwithstanding the Ministers objection, action should proceed on grounds of urgent public necessity. The Governor-General would come tohis own decision on this question, and this should be made clear in the RoyalInstructions. But he would in any case be required to report the whole matter to the Secretary of State.5. It should be noted that, except to the extent indicated in paragraph 2(iii) above, the whole of these arrangements would relate only to matters
within the legislative and executive competence of. the federal Government.It would not be the business of the Board or of the Minister to intervene innative policy within the responsibility of the territorial Governments nor inany specific subject unless it came within the federal list.ANNEX IV(Para. 66 of Report)ECONOMIC FUNCTIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT1. The Conference^ recommendations on economic affairs are dividedinto three parts: external economic affairs, inter-territorial and territorialeconomic affairs, and development.External Economic Afeairs2. In a federation external economic relations would naturally be theresponsibility of the federal Government and Legislature. From the prac-tical point of view there would be great advantages in arranging for trade negotiations and discussions with other countries to be conducted by a singleauthority rather than three authorities. The following matters thereforeshould be a federal responsibility: -Import and Exchange Control3. At present the import and exchange control policies of all three terri-tories are directed to the same ends in accordance with the general economic policy of the Sterling Area. The Southern Rhodesia Government is repre-sented at Commonwealth conferences dealing with economic policy and actsin accordance with the decisions of such conferences. Similarly, generalpolicy with regard to import and exchange control for Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland is laid down by the Secretary of State for the Colonies inaccordance with the decisions of Commonwealth conferences. The detailed arrangements for Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland including their dollarceilings are determined by consultation between the Governments of these territories and the Colonial Office, which acts in close consultation with other interested Government departments in London. The Southern rhodesia government also acts in close consultation with the appropriate Governmentdepartments in London through the High Commissioner^ Office, althoughsuch action is, of course, on a purely voluntary basis. Although the detailed arrangements made by the Southern Rhodesia Government and by theNorthern Rhodesia and Nyasaland Governments at present may be some-what different, it is believed that the results are broadly the same. Thereshould therefore be no difficulty in arranging for these matters to be handledfor British Central Africa in the same way as they are at present handled for southern Rhodesia.Export Control4. Export control is only exercised at present by the three governments for a limited number of goods, which are not the same for the three terri-tories.   No special difficulty should arise over export control.Export Promotion5. A small organisation has recently been set up in the appropriateMinistry in Southern Rhodesia to encourage the use in other countries of
the products of the Colony; it is the nucleus of a department of overseastrade. This service should be made federal so that its benefits may beextended to the other Central African territories.Customs &apos;    - -6. Customs should be a federal responsibility, and it would be desirableto constitute the territories into a customs union. The advantages of a customs union may be summarised as follows:  (a) the abolition of tariff barriers between the territories would expand the domestic market for all commodities;(b) the abolition of tariff barriers would tend to minimise duplication andthe uneconomic siting of industries and thereby ensure the most economic use of the factors of production in the area as a whole;(c) since the economies of the three territories are complementary, theabolition of trade barriers would tend to promote economic stabilityby making the area a more viable unit and thereby improving its capacity for economic development;(d) the position of the area as a whole in bargaining on tariff matters withthe outside world would be strengthened^ by the creation of a customs union;(e) the abolition of tariff barriers within the area would make it more attractive to commerce and capital investment from outside;0) the reduction of customs posts following upon the abolition of tariff barriers might lead to some saving in staff and economies in admini-stration, and would also be of advantage from the point of view of tourism.7. The problems involved in the establishment of a customs union are highly technical and before a final decision to establish it is taken there shouldbe a detailed and expert enquiry by a committee including representatives ofthe three territories.8. Before a customs union could be established certain difficulties wouldhave to be overcome. They are as follows : (a) the three territories have developed different tariff systems which wouldnot be capable of immediate alignment; and the different systems have resulted in different taxation structures.(b) the present tariff structures of the three territories reflect their differingcommercial and industrial needs (for example, Nyasaland levies importduties on cotton piece-goods which are not levied in the other two territories). Difficulties would arise in the initial stages in imposing a uniform tariff system if in consequence the interests of certainproducers and industries had to suffer.These difficulties do not appear to be insuperable, and they would clearlyfall to be considered by the expert enquiry, which should be asked inter aliato consider the effect of establishing a customs union on trade and commercein the three territories and on the revenues of the territorial Governments.9. One further difficulty in relation to a customs union is the fact thatthe Congo Basin area of Northern Rhodesia and the whole of Nyasaland hewithin the conventional zone covered by the Congo Basin Treaties, within whichdiscriminatory tariffs are not permitted. Even if the Congo Basin regime is toremain in force in Nyasaland and the Congo Basin area of Northern Rhodesia, itwould appear that a customs union between the territories could with advantage
be established. But it would none the less be essential to give the mostserious and early consideration to the possibility of excluding the Congo Basinarea of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland from the conventional zone coveredby the Congo Basin Treaties.10. Whether a customs union is established or not it would be necessaryto set up a Central African Tariff Advisory Committee representative of thethree territories and the federation.Trade Treaty Negotiations11. Great practical advantages would be derived from conducting tradetreaty negotiations on a Central African basis. At present both northern rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia have commercial treaties with the Union ofSouth Africa; and one of the early tasks of a federal department of external trade would be to prepare for the re-negotiation of these treaties on a central african basis. In negotiations relating to an International Trade Organisationand. the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Southern Rhodesia has beenseparately represented ; if external trade became a federal subject the central african Government would presumably be similarly represented.12. The various aspects of external trade referred to above might be handled by a federal department of external trade, which might form part ofthe appropriate federal Ministry. This department would have full executive responsibility for these matters, which would fall within the purview of thefederal rather than the territorial Legislatures.Inter-Territorial and Territorial Economic AfeairsInter-territorial Trade and Commerce13. It is of great importance that the federal Government should be givenadequate powers to deal with trade and commercial matters affecting two ormore of the territories. Many of the practical difficulties which have arisen inrecent years between the territories have been concerned with inter-territorialtrade ; coal for the Copperbelt is pehaps the outstanding example.14. It would not seem appropriate at the present stage for the federal government and Legislature to be simply entrusted, as in the United States,with &quot; inter-State commerce.&quot; &quot; Inter-State commerce &quot; is an extremely generalexpression and in the United States the scope of this phrase has been progres-sively extended by decisions of the Supreme Court until it covers a very largeproportion of all trade and commercial matters. For example, the phrase hasbeen held to cover the fixing of minimum wage rates, a matter which in central africa should be left to the territorial Governments and Legislatures. Theproper course appears to be to give to the federal Government and Legislatureresponsibility for those inter-territorial trade and commercial matters whichit is decided to make federal.15. Railways, trunk roads, civil aviation and electricity supply should befederal subjects. In addition the federal Government should be given execu-tive responsibility for regulating the inter-territorial (but not the territorial)movement and distribution of locally produced or imported commodities which are in short supply. The list of commodities to be the responsibilityof the federal Government should be promulgated from time to time on theadvice of the Development Commission referred to in paragraph 19 below.
16. Legislative and executive action regarding currency, companies,(6)insurance, banks (including land banks), bankruptcy, patents, trade-marksand designs should be federal subjects. The question of establishing a central bank may have to be re-examined.Bulk buying17. Each of the three Governments at present carries out bulk buying ofcertain commodities, in some cases for stockpiling purposes. It is obviouslydesirable to avoid competition in such purchases between the territorial Govern-ments and, quite apart from this, there may be advantages in certain cases in having commodities purchased for the whole area by the federal depart-ment concerned. In all cases where two territories are involved there shouldbe co-operation in bulk&apos; buying. Where appropriate the federal Governmentshould undertake bulk buying on behalf of the territories.Price and wages control; subsidies on consumer prices; rent and building control; excise; producer prices; road/rail competition1$. Price and wages control, subsidies, rent and building control and excise should be the responsibility, of the territorial Governments and Legisla-tures. At the same time, since the aim is to integrate general economic policy for the whole of Central Africa, it would^ be essential to establish adequatemachinery for the closest co-ordination of policy between the territories in allthese spheres, which are closely related to each other. This could be achieved in two ways. In the first place the department of the federal Governmentresponsible for the inter-territorial trade and commerce matters referred to inparagraph 15 above should also have co-ordinating functions, although notexecutive functions, in relation to price and wages control and the other mattersdiscussed in this paragraph. Secondly, an Economic Advisory Committee,representative of the three territories and the federation, should be set up tokeep these questions under general review and to help maintain co-ordinationof policy. There are no doubt other matters which this Committee would berequired to deal with : one of them is the co-ordination of policy with regardto producer prices, a matter which is important both from the development andthe price policy points of view ; another is road/rail competition and the ques-tion of the control of road traffic on inter-territorial roads. In order to preventunco-ordinated action by the territorial Governments in any of these mattersthere should be an agreed list of subjects on which action of material import-ance would not be taken without prior consultation through the economic advisory Committee or the federal department dealing with these subjects asthe case might be.Development19. Each of the territories has embarked on an extensive development programme for which financial and other resources are in sight and it wouldbe wrong to interfere with these programmes. It is, however, clearly of greatimportance that effective inter-territorial machinery should be established forthe co-ordination of development policies and programmes, and in para-graph 53 of the main Report it is recommended that, for this purpose, thereshould be established:  (a) a Development Commission representative of the Governments andLegislatures of the three territories and the federation; and(b) a Central Planning Staff with the necessary economic and other techni-cal experts attached to it and with appropriate assistance from thefederal Department of Statistics: the Central Planning Staff would form part of the appropriate federal Ministry.(6) See footnote (4) on page 21.
20. It would be the function of the Development Commission and theCentral Planning Staff to co-ordinate and keep under review the developmentneeds and programmes of Central Africa as a whole; the methods by whichit is suggested that the organisation should operate are fully described inparagraphs 53 and 54 of the main Report. Responsibility for carrying outthe various parts of the development programme would lie with the territorial governments as far as territorial departments are concerned and with thefederal Government as far as federal departments are concerned. Individualterritories might draw on the services of specialist departments from other territories-or the federal Government in appropriate cases; and no doubt thefederal Government would equally draw on territorial resources where needed.Agriculture, animal health, forestry and co-operation would be territorialsubjects, although general development policy affecting these departments a would be fully co-ordinated through the Development Commission and theCentral Planning Staff. The water departments should be territorial in sofar as urban water supplies and small scale water supplies are concerned;but for major water control and irrigation schemes a federal department should be established. In irrigation and water control matters, moreover, itis thought that Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland might be able to obtainvaluable assistance from the Southern Rhodesian Department on an agencybasis.Research21. Medium and long-term research should be a federal responsibility andan appropriate organisation or organisations should be set up for this purpose to work in close touch with the Development Commission. This would notin any way interfere with the experimental and short-term research activitiesof individual specialist departments in the territories; indeed, the federalresearch organisation might in many cases be able to assist in these activities.Marketing22. In all three territories marketing boards have been set up understatute with the general object of promoting price stability and expansion ofproduction of particular commodities. The commodities dealt with vary fromterritory to territory. In the first instance, at any rate, these statutory market-ing boards should in most cases remain a territorial responsibility, althoughthe establishment of federal marketing boards in appropriate cases should notbe excluded. Close co-ordination between the territories in connection withgeneral marketing policy is clearly desirable and could be achieved throughthe Economic Advisory Committee referred to in paragraph 18 above.Industrial Development23. Industrial development in the three territories is likely to a verylarge extent to remain a matter for private enterprise, although Governmentwill no doubt continue to participate in cases where the establishment of an industry is considered to be of great public importance and where privateenterprise will either not undertake the risk or will not undertake the riskwithout a special protection or participation by Government. Where indus-tries are established by private enterprise the decision as to their locationmust be made by the company concerned, subject, of course, to any arrange-ments which there may be for industrial licensing; but Government canclearly exercise a great influence over the location of industries through theprovision of road, rail or water communications, through freight rates or through the supply of power. Under the recommendations made in theReport rail communications, freight rates and power would be a matter for
the federal Government. Quite apart from this, however, it is clearly desir-able that industrial development, like other forms of development, shouldbe planned on a Central African basis and this should be one of the mostimportant fields for study by the Central Planning Staff and for discussion bythe Development Commission.24. At the same time it would not be desirable to take away from theterritorial Governments all responsibility for industrial development. Theremay be local reasons why an industry is thought to be required in a particular area and it should be open to the territorial Government, if the territorial. Legislature will vote, the money required, to provide financial inducements to^an/industry to start in a particular area. But in order to avoid the dangerof uncontrolled competition between the territories in the offering of induce-rnents to industries, it is desirable thai policy should be co-ordinated both asregards direct intervention by Governments (e.g., licensing of industry or financial participation in industries) and as regards indirect encouragement to industries (e.g., through the provisions of income-tax laws in regard toallowances for depreciation and facilities for setting off initial loans againstsubsequent profits). This co-ordination could be achieved through theDevelopment Commission.25.   It is accordingly recommended that-       *(a) it should be a function of the Development Commission to co-ordinatepolicy with regard to industrial development and to assess how far asa matter of general policy Government intervention or participationis required in any particular industry;(b) in cases where such intervention or participation is decided upon, theexecutive responsibility should lie with the territorial Government inthe case of industries primarily of local interest to the territory andwith the federal Government in the case of industries of concern to two or more territories. (In such cases no industry could, of course,be set up in a territory without the agreement of the territorialGovernment.)(c) Legislation on industrial development generally, including licensing ofindustries, should be a matter for the federal Legislature; but legisla-tion dealing with particular industrial development projects, which,under (b) above, would be the concern of the territories, should be amatter for the territorial Legislatures.Central African Loans Council27. As part of the co-ordination of development planning there shouldbe complete co-ordination of Government borrowing from sources outsideCentral Africa. It is understood that the Loans Council in Australia, whichis not strictly a federal agency but is representative both of the Common-wealth and the States, has been a most valuable and effective institution.The members of the Loans Council are either the Prime Ministers of the. Commonwealth and the States or the Treasurers; so that it is a body in aposition to take decisions at the highest level.28. It is recommended that a Central African Loans Council should beestablished representative of the Federal Government and the three territorial governments which should have the responsibility of considering require-ments for outside loan finance put forward by the federal and territorial governments; the Loans Council should not, however, deal with localborrowing. The members of the Loans Council should be of Ministerial or equivalent rank, and the Council should be empowered under the constitution
to fix priorities between the federal and territorial Governments, and todetermine the size of the loan programme, subject, of course, in the latter case to discussion with His Majesty&apos;s Government before seeking access tothe London market. [X29. The Loans Council should be. composed of one representative of thefederal Government and one representative of each of the territorial Govern-ments. This admittedly is open to the objection that the votes might beeven when a difference of opinion occurred. On the other hand, it wouldnot appear justifiable to give the federal Goverment and one territorialGovernment power to override the other two territorial Governments, as would happen if the federal Government had two representatives on theCouncil. There would be a strong inducement on the Council to reach decisions in a practical matter of this kind of such importance to the develop-ment of the territories and where there was a genuine division of opinion itmight be as well for time to be allowed for further discussions at lower levels.30. In Australia after policy decisions have been taken by the LoansCouncil all loans are raised by the Commonwealth Government acting, inthe case of State loans, on behalf of the State Governments. In central africa either the same arrangement could be adopted, in which case thefederal Government would be able to borrow on the security of its ownrevenues and those of the territories, or the federal and territorial Govern-ments could be responsible for raising their own loans. Provided that the loans Council is given power under the constitution, as suggested above, tosettle the size of the loan programme and to allocate priorities, it does not seem to be a very material matter which authority actually raises the loan.ANNEX V(Paras. 64 and 87 of Report)LIST OF SUBJECTS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTThe Conference recommends that the following subjects should become theresponsibility of the federal Government : External Affairs.Defence.Federal Income Tax.Federal borrowing.Immigration and Aliens.Customs.External Trade (including import and export control, export promotionand trade treaty negotiations).Exchange Control.Certain inter-territorial trade matters (see paragraph 15 of Annex IV).Census and Statistics.Currency.Companies.Insurance.Banks and Land Bank.Bills of exchange and promissory notes.Bankruptcy and insolvency.Copyright, patents, trade marks and designs.Economic planning and development, including general industrialdevelopment (see paragraph 25 of Annex IV).

The methods to be adopted in choosing the members of the federal legislature should be based on the methods of representation at present used in the respective territories.2. In Southern Rhodesia the 14 members, other than those chosen torepresent African interests, would be elected under the present system usedin electing the territorial legislature although enlarged constituencies wouldbe needed. The same method would apply to the election of the 8 Northern Rhodesian members other than those chosen to represent African interests.In Nyasaland there is no system of election, and the 4 members, other thanthose chosen to represent African interests, would be nominated by theGovernor from a panel selected by the Convention of Associations; this is thepresent method followed for the Nyasaland Legislative Council.3. In the case of the members nominated to represent African interests,the method would again differ in each territory. In Southern Rhodesia theSecretary for Native Affairs would call for lists of suitable names from theFederation of African Welfare Societies (which has many African members)and from the Race Relations Committee of the Joint National Council (which contains representatives of all chambers of industry, trade, commerce and mining, and. of municipal councils and farmers&apos; unions). After discussionwith these bodies and with the Department of Native Affairs (which might suggest additional names) a short list would be drawn up by the Ministerof Native Affairs and submitted to the Prime Minister. The final nomina-tions would be made by the Governor. The Northern Rhodesian membersrepresenting African interests would consist of two Africans elected by the
African Representative Council from among their number and nominated by the Governor, and one European nominated by the Governor. In N^jasa-land the two Africans would be nominated by the Governor from a panelelected by the African Protectorate Council and the European would be nominated by the Governor.ANNEX VIII(Para. 93 of Report)CONDITIONS OF SERVICE FOR MEMBERS OF GOVERNMENTI   , DEPARTMENTS, BRITISH CENTRAL AFRICAAnnex V contains a list of subjects for which it is recommended, theGovernment of British Central Africa should assume responsibility. Consider-able differences in the terms of service of the members of the Departmentsconcerned exist as between the three territories. Since the recommendationsof the Conference involve the unification of these Departments, and therebythe creation of a new British Central Africa service, it would be necessary toappoint a Public Service Commission whose task it would be: t. To compose salary scales and general conditions of service for thestaff of the Government Departments of British Central Africa; andthe general structure (including the promotion structure) of the central african Civil Service;2. To give officers who are at present employed by the territorial&apos;Governments, and whose departments are brought within the responsi-bility of the Government of British Central Africa, the choice between (a) transferring to the new conditions provided for the British central african Service;(by retaining (during such time as they remain unpromoted) theirpresent conditions of service;(c) leaving the service concerned, whether by retirement or, in the caseof the northern territories, by transfer to a territory outside central africa;3. To give special consideration to the following points:  (i) With reference to 2 (b) above, some doubt has been expressedwhether officers who elect to remain on their existing conditions ofservice should be required to accept the new conditions on pro-motion within the Central African Service.(ii) With reference to 2 (c) above, it has been suggested that any officer who does not wish to join the British Central Africa Service shouldbe entitled to take advantage of the provision in pensions legisla-tion relative to abolition of office.(iii) It has been suggested that there should be a time limit on theperiod within which officers should be allowed to continue toretain their old conditions of service.(iv) Consideration should be given to the question whether membersof the Colonial Service who elect to retain their existing conditionsof service should also retain their right of appeal to the Secretaryof State for the Colonies.(v) Although African Civil Services exist in all three territories, theirpresent scope varies considerably and steps would have to be takento ensure that existing avenues for advancement are preserved.
(vi) It should be accepted that there should be no discrimination on..,      grounds of race in making any appointment in the federal GivilService.ANNEX IX(Para. 96 of Report)FINANCIAL arrangements. In the light of the proposals made in the Report for the allocation of services and functions, federal expenditure at a rough estimate would amountto about  10 million assuming that expenditure under the various heads^remains at about the same level as in the recent past. The main source of federal revenue should be Customs duties, which would on a similar assump-tion yield about  4J million a, year. After allowing for the revenue of self-supporting services (mainly the.Post Office:  1,600,000 a year) it would benecessary to provide further revenue which at the outset might thus be of theorder of  4 million a year. (These figures do not include the revenue andexpenditure of statutory commissions which would come under the control ofthe federal Government, such as Rhodesia Railways and Central AfricanAirways.)2. It is proposed that the additional amount required should be raised by enabling the federal Government to levy its own income tax without interfering with the present power of territorial Governments to raise revenue from thesame source and to determine their own income tax policy. There would therefore be both federal and territorial income tax legislation; and in thegeneral interest there would have to be some machinery for consultation betweenfederal and territorial Governments on income tax matters to co-ordinate policy as far as possible, so as to ensure that neither the federal Government nor any territorial Government took action which would prejudice the clear needs of theother Governments. This machinery, which would be purely consultative,could be provided by the proposed Economic Advisory Committee (see para-graph 18 of Annex IV), which would be a joint body of the federal and terri-torial Governments. It would also be necessary to consider whether theadministration and collection of federal and territorial income tax should beundertaken by each Government separately or should be entrusted to a federaldepartment acting also on behalf of the territorial authorities. The relativemerits of the alternative courses would no doubt be discussed between the three governments, along with the many other matters that they would have toconsider together in preparation for the introduction of the federal scheme.3. The power of the federal Government to levy income tax, and thetransfer to it of customs revenue and of the expenditure on those services whichwould become federal, would affect alike the revenues and expenditure of thethree territorial Governments. When the arrangements for transfer of depart-ments and services to the federal Government had been fully settled, a fiscalconference representing the three territories should meet to assess the savings which would accrue to, and the losses of revenue whichwould be incurred by, each of them. The conference should recommenda general financial settlement between the federal Government and the Govern-ments of the three territories. The settlement should include provision for the equitable division of the burden of meeting federal expenditure and should ensure that each Government was in a position to finance the services for whichit was responsible and to carry out its development plans. It would presumablyprovide for review from time to time by agreement in the light of experience.
ANNEX X(Para. 98 of Report)CITIZENSHIPThe law of Southern Rhodesia makes provision for persons born there, &amp;c.,to be citizens of Southern Rhodesia. Under the British Nationality Act, 1948,these citizens are British subjects. Since Northern Rhodesia and Nyasalandare Protectorates persons born there are not ipso facto British subjects, butBritish-protected persons, although they can apply for naturalisation as citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies (and thereby become British subjects) byflvirtue of residence in the Protectorates. These differences introduce com-plexities in providing for a single effective citizenship of the proposed newfederation of British Central Africa. It would be possible for a federal law toestablish such a citizenship, and this would probably be useful for practical purposes and would help to instil a sense of solidarity and of loyalty to BritishCentral Africa as a whole, but according to the principles which govern british nationality at present such a law could not make these citizens British subjects as well. The result would be to impose a second citizenship on citizens ofSouthern Rhodesia, but there is no harm in this. &apos; There is a precedent in theFederation of Malaya where a person born in Penang or Malacca (which arepart of His Majesty&apos;s dominions) may be a citizen of the United Kingdom and colonies, a British subject, and a citizen of Malaya ; and a person born in aMalay State a citizen of Malaya, and a British-protected person. This is not apressing problem, and further consideration might be given to it later; but thefederal Legislature should be given power to enact a citizenship law if this isultimately decided to be desirable, and in that case citizenship should be addedto the list of federal subjects.40409  Wt.

-ANNEX IIIDRAFT STATEMENT IN HOUSE OF COMMONS BY SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR THE COLONIES ON DAY OF PUBLICATION OF closer association REPORTThe need for bringing about a closer association between Southern Rhodesia,Northern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland has been discussed for many years; but theproblem has hitherto proved difficult of solution. In 1945 there was established, inthe Central African Council, machinery designed to promote contact and co-ordination of policy between the Governments of the three Territories in mattersof common interest to them. The Council is purely advisory and the arrangementhas proved inadequate to its purpose. There is an increasing need for some formof closer association between the three Territories in the interests of their economic development, and of the prosperity and well-being of their inhabitants.2. As I announced in my statement of 8th November, 1950,C) it was agreed between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the three central african Governments, that senior officials from all four Governments should meet together to undertake a fresh examination of the problem in all its aspects, and tosee whether it was possible to formulate proposals which they could recommend to their respective Governments. I made it clear that adequate opportunity wouldbe afforded for public discussion of any proposals that might be put forward, andthat full account would be taken of African opinion in Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland before any change affecting African interests could be considered.3. The officials met accordingly in conference during March 1951. TheirReport, which is published to-day as Cmd. , and which is being simultaneouslyissued by the other Governments concerned, is unanimous on all points. Its main commendation is that closer association between the three Territories ought to bebrought about and that the need for this is urgent. It recommends further that thisshould be done not by amalgamation of the territories, but on a federal basis; andputs forward in some detail a scheme framed to take account of the special features of the Central African situation, including the self-governing status of SouthernRhodesia, and designed in particular to provide substantial safeguards for theinterests of Africans. Moreover, those matters most closely affecting the life of africans would, under the proposals in the Report, come within the territorialrather than the federal sphere; and within this sphere the Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland Governments would remain responsible, as at present, to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom.4. Neither His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom nor the otherGovernments concerned are at this stage committing themselves to acceptance of anyof the particular proposals in the Report, which is published as a basis forconsideration and discussion. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom,however, wish to say now that the proposals appear to them to- embody a con-structive approach to the problem which deserves the careful consideration of allthe peoples and Governments concerned.When there has been time for this consideration, I hope to visit the central african Territories with my Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations. In Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland I should ofcourse discuss the matter fully with representatives of the European and Africaninhabitants. The Government of Southern Rhodesia would by that time havereceived indications of the attitude of the inhabitants of that territory and this,information would be available for the purpose of discussions which my right honourable Friend would have with Southern Rhodesian Ministers. Finally, in thelight of these discussions, we should both attend a conference with southern rhodesian Ministers and representatives of the Governments and European and African communities of the two northern territories with a view to arriving at agreed conclusions to be laid before the respective legislatures.O Hansard, Col. 946-7.
5. In issuing this report for public consideration and discussion I wish onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to make it clear that,in relation to&apos;our responsibilities in Central Africa, we adhere fully to the policywhich has been repeatedly stated with the assent- of all parties. Our ultimate objective, is self-government within the Commonwealth, but self-government must include proper provision&apos;for both Europeans and Africans. We have set Africanson the path of political, social and economic progress and it is our task to help ihemforward in, that development so that they may take their full part with the rest ofthe Community in the political and economic life of the territories. The&apos; reportrecords the strong and unanimous belief of all members of the Conference that economic and political partnership between Europeans and Africans is the onlypolicy which can succeed in the conditions of Central Africa. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom have been glad to note that the Conferencehave given; expression to this very important principle as forming the basis fortheir proposals. :
