THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.: April 1951Copy No.      2CABINETTHE GOWERS REPORT ON HOUSES OF OUTSTANDING HISTORIC;OR ARCHITECTURAL INTERESTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in December 1948 my predecessor appointed a Committee under theChairmanship of Sir Ernest Gowers with the following terms of reference: - - .&quot;To.consider and report what general arrangements might be made by&apos;the Government for the preservation, maintenance and use of houses of outrstanding historic or architectural interest which might otherwise riot be pre-served, including, where desirable, the preservation of a house and its contentsas a unity.&quot;2. The Committee reported in March 1950, and its Report has been published.We must decide whether to accept the Committee&apos;s recommendations. Some ofthese are concerned with taxation and I expect to be pressed about our attitudeduring the debates on the Finance Bill. I ought to announce our intentions on theReport as a whole before the Bill is introduced.3. The Report is not at all easy to deal with. Many of the recommendations are open to strong objections of principle. Further, a scheme of preservation on thescale which the Committee envisage would be far too expensive in present circum-stances. Therefore, there is very little of what they recommend which can beaccepted unaltered. Nevertheless there is a real problem here, which they haveanalysed thoroughly, and I am sure that we must take some action. If we put itoff, we shall lose national assets which can never be replaced.4. . The proposals in this note have the agreement of the Minister of Works,the Minister of Local Government and Planning and the Secretary of State forScotland.The Problem5. The country houses of Great Britain are an important part of our nationalheritage. Their aesthetic, historic and educational value is recognised by everyoneand-now that so many of them are available for public visits or public use-givevery widespread pleasure. In the past houses and their grounds were maintained bytheir owners mainly from the rents of their estates. The estate and the mansionformed a single economic whole: the estate produced income, produce, servants andcraftsfnen for the maintenance of the house. This economic balance has nowdisappeared. Present rates of taxation make it impossible for the private owner tomaintain the largest of the houses out of income. Staffing difficulties and rising costof repairs and maintenance,,not to speak of the physical restrictions of the last decade, have all made the task more difficult. The effect is that the country houses,regarded as a capital asset, are running to waste. They are not being adequatelymaintained: their fabric is decaying; the contents are being dispersed and thegrounds sold; and often it happens that the house itself has to be sold and, failinganyOrie who will buy it for occupation, it is broken up for the sake of the lead,timber and fittings.40457 bCONFIDENTIALCP.

6. The problem is whether we should try and arrest this process, and if so,how we can do so. The longer we put it off, the more of these historic houses willhave disappeared for ever.The Proposals of the Gowers Committee .7. The full summary of recommendations contained in the Report is annexed to this note. The following paragraphs give the main proposals.8. The Committee recommend that statutory Councils should be created for england and Wales and for Scotland, which should be entrusted with the duty offurthering the preservation of historic houses. The Councils should be appointedby me (in consultation with the Secretary of State for the Scottish Council) and Ishould be responsible for them to Parliament; failing this the Minister of works should appoint them and be responsible for them. They should advise GovernmentDepartments, planning authorities, private owners and others on all matters relatingto historic buildings and their contents. They should compile a list of outstandinghouses, and, where necessary, their contents, which would be described as &quot; designated-nated houses&quot; to which the special provisions mentioned below would apply.- 9. The Councils would also be executive bodies, receiving grants-in-aid fortheir activities; they should have power to aid the preservation of designated houses and their contents by giving expert advice, by carrying out works, and by givingloans and grants at their discretion; they should have the power to acquire designated-Uated houses by agreement, or compulsorily, if that is necessary to preserve them.They should advise the Minister of Local Government and Planning on his use ofthe powers of &quot;negative preservation&quot; i.e., telling owners what they may not do with their property which he already has under the Town and Country PlanningActs; but he would remain finally responsible for them.10. The other main feature of the proposals of the Gowers Committee is aseries of tax reliefs in favour of the owner-occupiers of designated houses. TheCommittee&apos;s expressed policy is that these houses should, so far as possible, be preserved as private residences occupied, preferably, by the families connected withthem; from which they drew the conclusion that it should be made as easy aspossible for owner-occupiers to retain their ownership. Subject to various condi-tions, such as agreeing to show their houses to the public, owner-occupiers ofdesignated houses would get the following exemptions: - &apos;L&apos;(a) relief from income-tax and sur-tax in respect of approved expenditure on repairs to and maintenance of the house and contents (this goes far beyond the relief now allowable, which, broadly speaking, cannot exceed the amount of the Schedule &quot; A &quot; assessment on the property and takesno account at all of expenditure on contents of the house);(b) relief from death duties on the house, listed contents, and amenity land,so long as they were not sold; and(c) relief from death duties (subject to certain conditions) of property assigned to trustees to maintain the house out of that property.Objections to the Gowers Proposals11. I find the main proposals unacceptable as they stand. The form of organisation which they propose is open to several objections:  (a) I am not in favour of the Treasury taking on direct responsibility for. yet another body; if the Councils were to be set up on the lines proposedby the Committee we should have to fall back on their alternative recom-mendation that the Minister of Works should be responsible fqr them.(b) There is bound to be overlapping with the functions, of the Minister ofWorks, who has to maintain, in any event, a staff of architects andcraftsmen of the kind who would be needed by the Councils. At leastit would be highly inconvenient, and I understand that it would be unacceptable to the Minister, that he and his creature, the Council,should be competitors in the market for this highly skilled man-power,or alternatively that he should allow his own creature to use his staffon an agency basis. In short, if the Minister is finally responsible, thereis no need for the Council as an intermediary.(c) I do not like withdrawing expenditure on this kind of service from the direct control of Parliament and meeting it by a grant-in-aid.
(d) The Gowers Committee rightly conclude that the ultimate power to insist- i   on the preservation of a building cannot.be..exercised.by anyone except;    -   a Minister, since it affects private interests. : Therefore the body mainly responsible under these proposals for the preservation of historic houses would not enjoy this power. This is a weakness of organisation. ,&apos; (e) It is doubtful-and certainly this is the impression given by the recommen-dations of the Gowers Committee-whether a statutory body of thiskind could ever work as effectively as a Ministry through local authori-ties; but this is a sphere of&quot; activity in which local interest and localcontributions are most valuable. &apos;   : r -12. For these reasons I rejects the idea of independent executive HistoricBuildings Councils. .13. I.also&apos; reject their proposals on taxation. I need not stress the political difficulty of giving specially favourable treatment for this purpose to the owners oflarge houses. Moreover, from the point of view of taxation policy these concessionswould be extremely dangerous. We have always tried, so far as possible, to avoidmeasuring a man&apos;s liability to tax by his particular choice of commitments. TheGowers proposals would make a wide breach in this principle and would give riseto claims which it would be hard to resist from other people for similar treatment in comparable cases. .     v -An alternative policy . . , ;14. The proposals of the Gowers Committee were founded mainly on thedesire to keep historic houses in private ownership; and they went to great lengthsin proposing means to this end. There is a strong case, elaborated in their Report,for encouraging private occupation in many cases. Private ownership is another matter, and I see no reason why we should encourage it. I am more inclined toencourage ownership by the State or by the National Trusts for England and scotland, who already have long experience and great public goodwill. This is notin the least incompatible with private occupation, as the experience of the NationalTrusts shows.15. I propose, therefore, that we should adopt the following alternative policy: - (a) Direct responsibility by the Minister of Works for the preservation of historic houses; the statutory commissions should only be advisory.(b) No specific encouragement of private ownership as such; but every encouragement of, and co-operation with, the National Trusts, whocombine public (though not State) ownership with the possibility ofprivate occupation where this is expedient.(c) Transfer of the relevant powers of negative preservation now enjoyed bythe Minister of Local Government and Planning to the Minister ofWorks in order that all powers necessary for the preservation of historicnouses should be concentrated in him.(d) As much as possible to be done through local authorities.(e) Some expenditure by the Ministry for the preservation of historic houses,part of which will be spent through local authorities or the NationalTrusts.(/) No taxation reliefs in favour of private owners.(g) Some small exemptions from death duties in respect of property given orleft to the National Trusts or the State (no exemptions are needed inrespect of property owned by the National Trusts since they alreadyenjoy complete exemption as charities).(h) Similar, but not identical, provisions for Scotland, where the powers wouldbe shared between the Minister of Works and the Secretary of State.16. In present circumstances we shall have to limit expenditure on historichouses to the minimum; we cannot possibly afford, in terms either of money or ofman-power, as much as could usefully be spent on this purpose. The Gower&apos;s committee mentioned as an aim (though not in the least as a minimum) assistance by way of taxation remission or otherwise to some 2,000 houses. This is probablyan under-estimate of what could usefully be done if resources were unlimited;I understand that the Ministry of Town and Country Planning are likely ultimately to list something like 5,000 houses as Grade I, on most of which some assistance40457 ------    :   - VS ii i-   ^ttitih^l to &apos;ZyX,:&apos;&apos; B 2
would not be,wasted.In. addition many of the houses which are listed only asGrade, II (which may include as many as 90,000) ought to be preserved, and somepi them, are in greater need of assistance than some of those in Grade I: But inpresent circumstances we must work on a more modest scale, and confine our help to those cases where it isvitally necessary. ,,  . .17. If we were to concentrate all our efforts on encouraging the private owner-ship of - houses it might, cost a little less; as neither the State itself nor the NationalTrusts (which are charities) pay any tax at all, ownership and upkeep of houses by the State or the National Trusts is the method which costs most to the Exchequer,and any form of assistance to private owners, whether by way of loan, grant, or partial^ remission of taxation, might come qijt cheaper. But for the reasons ofprinciple W^ do riot think that we should be affectedby this to limit our expenditure..18. The following paragraphs set out my proposals. If they are accepted Ipropose that I should announce them straight away and that the Minister of works and the Secretary of State for Scotland should be authorised to prepare legislation,on the lines which we propose, for introduction next session.Organisation &quot; ;19. The Minister of Works should be charged with the duty of protectingbuildings of historic or architectural interest in England and Wales. He should setup Historic Buildings Councils for England and Wales which would not haveexecutive powers, but which would advise him on the general policy to be adopted,on the broad allocation of funds, on the listing of buildings and monuments, on thepreservation of individual buildings and monuments and generally on any matteraffecting the preservation of historic buildings and monuments.20. The Ministry should become the central authority for advising Govern-ment Departments, planning authorities, owners and others, on all matters relatingto historic buildings and their contents.21. Unlike the Councils proposed by the Gowers Committee, the Minister ofWorks can and should take over from the Minister of Local Government and planning existing powers under the Town and Country Planning Acts, to list build-ings of special historic or architectural interest and to make Preservation Orders.He would operate through local authorities (wherever appropriate), and for thispurpose there would be appropriate powers as in the Town and Country planning act, 1947, for-(i) buildings to be listed for the purpose of declaring their historical or architectural-tectural value and preserving them as far as practicable;(ii) appeal by the owner against refusal of consent to demolish or alter a&quot; listed&quot; building with provision for payment of compensation inappropriate cases;     -(hi) service of purchase notice on the local authority or the Ministry of Worksif consent to demolition or alteration is refused and the building therebybecomes &quot;incapable of reasonably beneficial use&quot;; and(iv) acquisition (compulsorily if necessary for the preservation of the building)either by the local authority or by the Minister.There would be power to list and treat all or part of the contents of a building, forpurposes Of preservation, acquisition, &amp;c, as part of the building.22. The Ministry of Works and local authorities would be given power toacquire land, buildings, and monuments for the purposes of the Bill by gift, legacy,purchase or compulsory purchase, or otherwise. If the National Trust needed such powers and would find them useful, it would be empowered, subject to the agree-;merit of the Ministry and to the consent of any interested party to an alterationof the trusts concerned, &amp;c, to transfer to the Ministry the ownership of any land,buildings or monuments. With Treasury consent, the Ministry would be empoweredto transfer land or buildings to the National Trust or to any local authority. Itwould also be empowered to let any property in its ownership.to the National Trust.or to any Other party at less than the normal rent, or at a peppercorn rent if this,were necessary in order that the purposes of the Bill might be carried put. Thusthere would be the greatest flexibility in&quot; the dealings between the Ministry and theNational Trust: each could take on the work for which it is best fitted, ,
23. The Minister.; or any local authority, would be empowered to give loansor grants to the owners of historic buildings, whether public or private (an! thiswould include the National Trust) where he was satisfied that this was needed&apos; forits preservation or maintenance. w &apos;   - \- 24. The Ministry would have other subsidiary powers, e.g., to make arrangedments with the National Trust Or any other body or person fOr the management ofany land or buildings which it: owned, to give advice (sometimes free Of change)-toall Owners of buildings or monuments on their treatment, and to carry out works to historic buildings Or ancient monuments at the1 expense of the owner Or at suchcharge as it might decide. - &apos; i- w-25.  There would be corresponding powers as regards listed contents of bouses&apos;:26. Any grants given to owners of houses would be subject to the following conditions:  the house must be properly maintained, and the owner must do to that endsuch things as may be prescribed by the Ministry or the local authority;the owner must make the house accessible to the public to a prescribedextent;     .if the house is acquired in due-course by the Government or by any localauthority, no account should be taken in determining the price of anyaccretion of value caused by assistance given by the Ministry or any local authority; andif the owner wished to sell his house the Ministry should have first option to buy it at a price determined as in (c).Financial Arrangements27. The Minister would have powers to make grants to Local Authorities inrespect of any compensation paid; or of loss incurred as a result of acquisition, atrates which he would agree with me (the present rates of grant under Section 94 ofthe Town and Country; Planning Act range from 20 per cent, to 50 per cent.,according to the financial strength of the Authority).28. The Ministry&apos;s expenditure on current purposes should be voted in theordinary way and not as a grant-in-aid (which is what the Gowers Committeesuggested). The Minister will have to plan ahead with care, particularly at a-timeof limited resources. I should therefore propose that the net amount to be provided on his Vote for the preservation and maintenance of monuments, buildings and theircontents, for works, and for loans and grants for these purposes, less any recoveries,should be treated as a fixed ration. Thus would be determined on a five-year basis.29. The Minister, with the advice of the Historic Buildings&apos; Councils, would determine how the available money should be used, as between the different methodsof assistance and the different claimants. On this he would have a pretty free hand;the important thing, from my point of view, is that he should keep within the agreedtotal. This is not a matter on which we can afford an open-ended liability.30. In so far as the Ministry acquires property (including contents of houses)it would be appropriate, I think, that the cost should be met from the National LandFund: it is the kind of thing for which it was set up. In ofder to retain fullParliamentary control I propose that any such cost should be met from Votes andthat an equal amount (up to a maximum to be written into the Bill) should betransferred from the National Land Fund and appropriated in aid of the Vote.Scotland31. Somewhat different arrangements will be required for Scotland. Thedetails have still to be worked out, but, broadly speaking, it is proposed that theSecretary of State should continue to be responsible for the work done by the localauthorities and for making grants to them. The Minister of Works would havepower to acquire or to accept gifts of buildings for the purpose of preserving them.Grants and loans to private owners would be made by the Minister of Works. Thenecessary specialist staff would be concentrated in the Ministry of Works; but thetwo Ministers would wofk in close consultation and the Scottish Historic BuildingsCouncil would be appointed by them jointly.32.  Separate legislation will be required for Scotland.
H. G.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,llth April, 1951.Taxation        .., . -     v,-  - &apos; - ;   -,&apos;     - .-1 :&apos; 33.&apos; As I have said, I reject any large coricessidrisihthe!,field of taxatibii to private owners of historic houses. It may be that, when the Ministry of Works havepower to direct owners to carry out works.on the structure of their houses for thepurpose of its preservation, it will be advisable slightly to widen the income tax rulesso as to permit the cost of such works to rank for relief from tax under Schedule Aeven though an element of capital expenditure is involved which would normally be disallowed. But this is a small matter, not in the least comparable to the enlarge-ment of maintenance claims proposed by the Gowers Committee, and; we cannotdeal with it until the Ministry of Works have been given their powers. No decisionon it is needed at the present time.34. I am prepared to accept in substance the minor recommendation onentertainments duty recommended by the Gowers Committee (see paragraph (xvi)of the Annex). But I doubt whether this really needs legislation at present;35. I also propose to allow certain exemptions from estate duty in favourof property given or bequeathed to the National Trust, the Government or public bodies: The necessary provision will be made in this year&apos;s Finance Bill, or failingthat, in the Bill for the protection of historic houses, which I hope will be takenin the next session. They are the following:  (a) exemption for contents of houses given or bequeathed to the National-   Trust, the Government or other public bodies;(6) exemption for gifts or bequests of houses and land to public bodies (as already applies to the National Trust);(c) exemption for endowment funds given or bequeathed with houses to public bodies;(d) expansion of the scope of the present provisions which allow land and houses to be taken in payment of death duties and paid for out of theNational Land Fund, so as to enable chattels to be taken in the same way when they are ordinarily kept in houses so taken or already in the. possession of the Crown or the National Trust.Conclusion36.   I recommend-(a) that the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the Gowers Report-should be on the lines set out in this paper; y(b) th^t I should announce it as soon as possible in the House of Commons;and(c) that the Minister of Works and the Secretary of State for Scotland be.      authorised to introduce the necessary legislation during next Session.
