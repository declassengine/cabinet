THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENT.....      Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1951Copy No. 31CabinetROYAL COMMISSION ON DIVORCEMemorandum by the Lord chancellor at the Prime Minister^ request, I have had preliminary.discussions with theHome Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the English and ScottishLaw Officers about the Royal Commission on Divorce. It has been agreed thatthere should be one Commission for England and Scotland but that NorthernIreland should not be included, both because of the large Roman Catholic minority in that country and because the proportion of the Protestant population whichis opposed to divorce is probably much higher there than it, is either in EnglandOr in Scotland. ...2. A matter on which Ministers have so far been unable to reach agreement is whether the Royal Commission should include Bishops and other representativesof the Churches, or whether the Churches should be left to give evidence aswitnesses before the Commission. The Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland think that the Churches should be directly represented on the Commis-sion, and that, if they were not, the Commission would not command a full measureof public respect. The Attorney-General and the Sohcitor-General, on the otherhand; thought that in view of the well-known and strongly held views of the churches on the subject of divorce it would be a mistake for them to be represented,and that in fact their representation would not increase the respect which it isnecessary that the Commission should command in the eyes of the public! Onthe whole, I find myself disposed to agree with the view expressed by the EnglishLaw Officers.3. The argument in favour of direct representation of the Churches on theCommission is, of course, that the subject of marriage and divorce is of pre-eminentconcern to all the Christian Churches, and one on which-it is inevitable that theirviews should be heard with respect. The then Archbishop of York was a memberof the Royal Commission of 1912, although it is true that there Were no otherChurch representatives on that Commission unless the Dean of the Arches be counted as one it is more probable that he was selected because of his expertknowledge of ecclesiastical law. Those who think that the Churches should berepresented on the Commission argue that not only would it be regarded as astrange omission by the general public were they not to be included, but that failure to do so would be looked upon as one further step towards the separation betweenthe Christian and the secular conception of marriage. .4. The objection to having representatives of the Churches on the commission is, first, that this would necessarily involve a considerable increase in the size ofthe Commission, as not only would the Church of England and the Free Churchesrequire to be represented but there would also have to be one and possibly two representatives of the Scottish Churches, and the Roman Catholic Church would no doubt also have to be invited to nominate a representative, although it wouldprobably decline to do so. Secondly, it is argued with some force that the Churches,or at any rate the majority of the Churches, have already expressed such clear views as to the indissolubility of marriage that their representatives could hardly be40503CONFIDENTIALCP.

House of Lords, S.W. 1,27th April, 1951.expected to approach the problem of the reform of the. divorce law with sufficientlyfresh minds, and that for this reason they would be of far greater value as witnessesbefore the Commission. In this connection it may be appropriate to recall thewords of the Departmental Committee on the Procedure of Royal Commissions,Whose Report was published in 1910 (Cmd. 5235 of 1910) and who say inparagraph 15:   committee,;;/,:&apos;.&apos;:.&quot; And it is of equal or greater importance that those selected as commissioners-sioners should, as far as possible, be persons who have not committed, them-selves so deeply on any side of the questions involved in the reference as torender the probability of an impartial inquiry and an unanimous Reportpractically impossible.&quot; It seems to us impossible to avoid the conclusion that appointmentshave sometimes been made to Commissions of individuals whose proper place would rather have been in the witness box than on the tribunal. A Commis-sion selected on the principle of representing various interests starts with aserious handicap against the probability of harmony in its work, and perhap seven of practical result from its labours.&quot;. . . . The true object of the appointment of a Royal Commission is toobtain a carefully considered judgment on the matters within their terms ofreference; and this object is imperilled when the preliminary considerationsmentioned above are disregarded, because its members are apt to divide almostfrom the date of their appointment into two or more opposing parties,&quot;No doubt it will be exceedingly difficult to discover anyone who is suitablefor appointment to a Royal Commission on the divorce law who has not already reached some provisional conclusions on the subject matter of the inquiry, but to invite anyone as deeply committed to a particular point of view as a representativeof any of the Christian Churches must be is, it is argued, to court the very diffi-culties to which the Departmental Committee drew attention.5. Finally, it may be said by those who oppose the Churches&apos; representation on the Commission that such representation would necessarily imply acceptanceof the Christian view of marriage, and that this is not a matter which should beregarded as beyond controversy in the&apos; appointment of the Commission. this argument is not, perhaps, a strong one, as it can readily be answered by sayingthat the Churchmen were appointed as representatives of an important element inthe national life, but nevertheless it may well be an argument which it might bedesirable to avoid if possible.6. I think that the considerations on both sides of this question are fairlyevenly balanced, but before submitlmg to the Prime Minister a list of names forhis consideration, I should be glad of guidance on the above question.J.
