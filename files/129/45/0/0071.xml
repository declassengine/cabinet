(51) 14628th May, 1951 &apos;cabinet internation  LABOUR CONVENTION  (No.  96)  CONCERNINGFEE-CHARGING EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES : (REVISED 1949)Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service desire to obtain the decision of my colleagues on the action to be taken withregard to the ratification of Convention No. 96 concerning Fee-Charging Employ-ment Agencies, which was adopted by the International Labour Conference at its -32nd Session in 1949: This Convention provides for either (a) the abolition of fee-charging employment agencies conducted for profit andthe regulation of other fee-charging employment agencies, or(b) the regulation of all fee-charging employment agencies.States ratifying the&quot; Convention may adopt either of these alternatives.   In theUnited Kingdom the adoption of either alternative will necessitate legislation.2. The alternative of the regulation of all fee-charging employment agencies(1 (b) above) was introduced into the Convention by the International LabourConference largely owing to the support given by the United Kingdom delegation on the instructions of Ministers. This was in accordance &quot;With the decision of theLord Presidents Committee (L.P. (49), 1st Meeting, Minute 2). I accordingly recommend that we should decide to ratify the Convention on this basis. Provisionfor the inclusion of a Bill for the purpose of regulating fee-charging employment agencies was made in the programme of legislative measures for the next Session,which was submitted to the Cabinet in CP. (51) 125 and approved by it. I ask that authority should now be given for the preparation of the Bill.3.  The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland, who will beresponsible for the legislation in Parliament, concur in these proposals.4. Corresponding legislation will be required in Northern Ireland, and it isunderstood that the Government of Northern Ireland will be prepared to introduce such legislation, if we do so.5.  The following Annexes are attached:  I. The provisions of the Convention relating to the regulation of fee-charging employment agencies (i.e., Part HI of the Convention).II. An outline of the method of regulation proposed to be adopted.III. Notes of the provisions to be included in the proposed legislation.A.

Control of fee-charging employment agencies will be exercised by localauthorities operating under the general supervision of the central Government.2. Agencies would be required to obtain a licence from the County.council or County Borough Council (England and Wales) or the&quot; COnptoon^Couhcil inthe case of the City of London or Town Council of large Burgh&apos; (Scotland), as thecase might be. General supervision would be exercised by the respective secretaries of State.3. The powers to be vested in these Local Authorities would cover the whole ofGreat Britain instead of the present control exercised only in some areas and insome of these only sketchily.  The powers would, however, be in general the same
as those at present-exercised by ;the ^London&apos; County &apos;.Gouhcil under Sections .11-14of theL:C.C. (General Powjers) Act, 1921. /Additional provisions would,.however,be necessary in ordef jto comply with the f^uirements of the Conventions(a) the requirement that an agency shall charge only fees and expenses on a;-       -scale submitted to and approved bytheiiLocal Authority;-(b) a power to deal with the placing of workers abroad and their recruitmentfrom outside Great Britain (the present control exercised by the L.C.C.relates to the placing abroad of women only).This control an, London hasnot been -the cause of complaint, and even with ;theseadded powers it is difficult to see how any reputable agency could reasonably raise objection. Moreover, the power to be exercised by the Local Authorities would besubject to appeals by aggrieved parties to the Courts. k   ,4. It should be explained as regards the recruitment of workers from abroadfor placing in this country that, although the control of fee-chargittg&quot;employment agencies undertaking such recruitment would be entrusted to Local Authorities, theissue to employers of permits under Article 1 (3) (h) of the Aliens Order for employ-meat of particular ahens would still be controlled by my Department, whose practiceof dealing direct with the respective employers and not with employment agencies inregard to applications for such permits will be continued.5. The control of fee-charging employment agencies through licensing by theLocal Authorities would involve no additional cost to Government Departments,and the burden falling oh Local Authorities should not be significant, especially as owing to the number and distribution of such agencies and other circumstances,the London County Council and most other authorities likely to be much affectedalready exercise licensing: powers.ANNEX IIINotes of the Provision to be included in the Proposed legislation. No person to carry on an employment agency without a licence from the licensing Authority or,charge fees for expenses in excess of the scale submitted toand approved by that authority.2.  Licensing Authorities to be- (a) County Councils;(b) County Borough Councils (in the City of London the &quot; Common Council&quot;);(c) Town Councils of large Burghs in Scotland..3.

Licensing Authority to have power (a) to grant licences and to approve scales of fees and expenses submitted byapplicants;(b\ to refuse to grant or renew or to revoke licences on any of the following grounds:  -(i) that an applicant or licence holder is unsuitable;(ii) that the premises are unsuitable;(hi) that the agency is or has been illegally or improperly conducted;(iv) in the case of an application for a licence or its renewal, that thescale of fees and expenses submitted is not approved.5. Licensing Authority not to refuse to renew or&quot; to revoke a licence unlessdue notice has been given to licence holder of objection to renewal or of intentionto revoke and licence holder to have opportunity of being heard.6.   Applicants for licences to pay a fee when licence granted.7.  Licences to be valid for one year unless revoked.
