Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs at their meeting on 22nd March (C.M.(51) 22nd Conclusions,Minute 7) the Cabinet invited me to submit a memorandum evzplaining thebasis on which I propose to reopen the negotiations for the revision of theAnglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936.     This decision arose from a considera-tion by the Cabinet of the conclusions of the Defence Committee on 19thMarch (D,C(51) 6th Meeting, Minute 1).     The Defence Committee thenapproved proposals put forward in two papers (D.O.(51) 12 and d.O0(51) 28) by the Chiefs of Staff as a basis for negotiation with theEgyptian Government.     These Chiefs of Staff proposals in turn were theresult of the Cabinet1 s decision on 14th December, 1950 (C.M.(50) 36thConclusions, Minute 5) to cause the necessary studies to be made in orderthat His Ma.jesty&apos;s Government should be able to decide whether the methodof approach outlined on a personal basis by my predecessor to the EgyptianMinister for Foreign Affairs last December would satisfy our essentialdefence needs.2. The Cabinet will recall that the Egyptians have been pressing us for many years to evacuate Egypt, and that in 1946, in accordance with oneof the provisions of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, a provisional agreement was reached with the then Egyptian Government.     This agreement wouldhave provided, inter alia, for the replacement of the present Treaty by anew Treaty of Alliance, and for the evacuation of all British Forceswithin a period of three years.    Owing to a difference of interpretation of a protocol concerning the future of the Sudan, the Agreement was neversigned, and we have continued to remain in Egypt and to maintain and buildup our base in the Canal Zone.    We have sought to justify this under the1936 Treaty,    After 1946 we were unwilling to negotiate with successiveEgyptian Governments because we regarded them as entirely unrepresen-tative.    At the beginning of last year, however, a Wafd Government, whichwe regard as broadly representative, came into power and renewed the familiar Egyptian demands.    The Chiefs of Staff papers, to which I have referred, form the basis of instructions to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atCairo to resume negotiations, if my colleagues decide that it is desirableto proceed with the attempt to reach agreement with the Egyptian Govern-ment.3. The problem which I suggest we have to consider is how to reconcile our military requirements for a Middle East base and our political requirements for the maintenance of our position in the middle east with the need to take account of the continued pressure of successiveEgyptian Governments, and of public opinion in the Middle East and else-wh^re, to secure the withdrawal of British troops from Egyptian soil.
Arguments in favour(a)    If we do not reach agreement with the Egyptian Government, theymay well take the dispute between us to the United Nations. . They did so in 1947 after the failure of the Bevin-Sidky negotiations, and thematter still remains technically on the agenda of the Security Council.The Egyptians then attempted to secure a recommendation of theSecurity Council to the effect that the 1936 Treaty was no longer validand that we were, therefore, not entitled to retain British forces inEgypt.    They failed then to secure such a recommendation, and theSecurity Council was unable in the end to agree on any recommendation.Whatever might be the decision of the Security Council now, we should at best be put in the invidious position of having to justify the retentionof our forces in a country whose Government objected strongly to their,presence, and under an instrument whose provisions we ourselves have largely overstepped.    If we had made no serious attempt to reach agreement with the Egyptians beforehand, we might expect litlesympathy or assistance even from our friends;  if, however, we had made a reasonable offer (for instance, something broadly speaking as favourable to the Egyptians as the Bevin-Sidky proposals, but taking account of the changed international situation) our position would be considerably strengthened.The main points of the present proposals of the Chiefs of Staff may bevery briefly summarised as follows:-(i)     There will be a phased withdrawal of British troops from Egyptwhich will be completed in five years ending at the end of 1956.(ii)     Thereafter there shall be a British base in Egypt manned by some3,500 British civilians.    This base might be held under anagreement with the Egyptian Government.(iii)     There shall be an integrated Anglo-Egyptian Air defence organisation requiring the continued presence of some 10,000R.A.F. personnel in Egypt.(iv)    We shall have the right of re-entry into Egypt if we considerthat war is imminent.4. There are a number of points about these proposals which will certainly be objectionable to the Egyptian Government.     For example,they are likely to resent the continued operation of the base by a largenumber of British personnel after 1956.    Secondly, they are likely to object that the proposed withdrawal of British forces is not sufficientlyrapid, especially since under the 1946 proposals we agreed to withdraw from Egypt within three years.     Thirdly, they may well consider thenumber of R.A.F. personnel proposed for the Air Defence Oranisation to be excessive, and even if this Organisation can be set up now, it is unlikelythat the Egyptian Government will commit themselves regarding the post-1956 period.     Fourthly, the Egyptians are unlikely to agree that we shouldconstitute ourselves the judges of whether a war is imminent since adecision to this effect would carry with it the right to send our troops backto Egypt.5. Arguments for and against attempting to reach agreement.The arguments in favour of and against resuming negotiationswith the Egyptian Government on this basis may be summarised as follows:-
(b) If we do not reach agreement with the Egyptians, we may expectthem to make trouble for us in Egypt.    They could do so by means of administrative obstruction such as the denial of port, railway andlabour facilities.    They would probably not thereby make the positionof our forces in the Canal Zone untenable, but such action would gravelyimpair the efficiency of the base.    It is, however, possible (though not likely) that such measures might lead on to full-scale economic warfarebetween Egypt and the United Kingdom in which both we and they would suffer severely.    It is, in any case, likely that there would be anti-British demonstrations and rioting which might (though this again isno more than a possibility) even lead to our having to interveneforcibly for the protection of British lives.    In such an event subsequentdevelopments would be incalculable but might result in our havingeventually to take over the administration of the country in order tomaintain our position.    The situation would, no doubt, be exacerbatedif we had made no serious attempt to reach agreement, and if the pro-ceedings of the United Nations had given support to Egyptian claims.(c) The 1936 Treaty is, in any case, under Article 16, due for revision in 1956, at the request of either party, and if no agreement can be reached then, the difference shall be submitted to &apos;The Councilof the League of Nations&quot; (that is, probably, for this purpose theSecurity Council of the United Nations).    We have, therefore, to face the probability that after 1956 we shall have no legal basis at all forour continued presence in Egypt.    We must, therefore, look ahead and consider alternative arrangements, especially in view of the time needed for administrative readjustment.    Meanwhile we are already infringingthe 1936 Treaty, which was designed for a purpose totally different fromthat for what we are at present using it.    It was specifically designedto ensure the liberty and security of navigation in the Suez Canal against any external threap not to provide a main base from which we shouldfight a campaign to defend the Middle East.    The number of troops which we at present have in the Canal Zone, and the area which weoccupy, are, and have for some time past been, greatly in excess ofthose stipulated in the Treaty.    Some revision of it, therefore, or thesubstitution of a new agreement, would be desirable.(d) An agreement with Egypt is one of the pre-requisites for any com-prehensive defence arrangement in the Middle East.    We cannot makea defence agreement with Israel for co-operation in war-time without first reaching agreement with Egypt,    If we tried to reverse the pro-cess we should lose the Arab States.    On the other hand, an agreementwith Egypt might open the way for a subsequent and separate agreement by us with Israel.(e) The more generous our offer to Egypt the better are the chances of egyptian co-operation in such matters as the provision of the facilitiesessential to us in time of war and of Egyptian man-power.    A settle-ment might also improve the chances of Egyptian political co-operationwith us in world affairs generally.    A failure to reach, and still more to try to reach, agreement will make Egyptian and Arab co-operationboth in peace and war more unlikely and might involve us in difficultiesin Iraq and Jordan, where we have strategic facilities at present.Arguments against(i) An agreement to withdraw British troops from Egypt may be inter-preted in Egypt and elsewhere as a yielding to Egyptian pressure.    this might, to some extent, weaken our political position in the Middle East.
So long as we are actually in Egypt, the Egyptians must know that,if they overstep certain limits, they must mate it correspondinglymore probable that we shall insist upon remaining in Egypt,Equally, the presence of British troops in the Canal Zone and theMiddle East base exercises a stabilising influence throughout theMiddle East as a whole.(ii) We need to retain the Middle East base and to send British troops into Egypt in time of war.    Any decision to withdraw our troopsgradually before 1956 must prejudice to some extent our ability to do this.    The extent to which this is true depends partly upon whether any war comes before or after 1956, and partly upon the general political situation both in Egypt and in the rest of the world.(iii) The Egyptians will certainly raise the question of the future status of the Sudan.    We cannot make any substantial concessions to the mover this, and it may well be that no agreement will be possible.    Ifwe cannot agree on the Sudan, it may be that our efforts to reach agreement on defence will prove abortive.conclusion. We have frequently stated publicly that it is our desire to settleoutstanding differences with Egypt in the spirit of the long tradition of friendship between the two countries, on a basis of equality, and with fullrespect for the independence and sovereignty of Egypt.    Since the war,there has been an increased strain on our own resources all over the world.This has made it harder to maintain our position in the face of Egyptiandemands, but at the same time the growth of the Soviet menace has made iteven more imperative that we should maintain a firm base from which todefend the Middle East.    It would be difficult to meet the.further strain onour resources which might be occasioned by an immediate rupture with egypt over the current negotiations.7. There are therefore three possible courses of action before us:-(a) to maintain our forces and base in the Canal Zone and tell theEgyptian Government that we are not prepared in presentcircumstances to resume negotiations for a revision of the1936 Treaty;(b) to make a real effort to secure agreement by negotiation on a revision of the Treaty;(c) to offer to resume negotiations with the Egyptian Governmentupon the basis of the proposals of the Chiefs of Staff, but tomake no substantial concessions which would derogate fromthese proposals.8, If we adopt the first course, we should have to be prepared tomaintain our position in the teeth of the Egyptian Governments opposition.As I have already made clear, this would entail serious political conse-quences.    It might also give rise to administrative difficulties for our forces in the Canal Zone, and possibly lead to disorders endangeringBritish lives and property.

9. The second course would almost certainly involve some further-concessions to the Egyptians who, as I have stated, are unlikely to acceptthe present proposals as they stand.    The Chiefs of Staff have statedthat their present requirements represent a minimum, any reduction ofwhich would gravely prejudice our retention of the Middle East base ina state which would permit its immediate use at the beginning of a war.It would be difficult therefore for us to offer any purely military con-cessions sufficiently substantial to influence the Egyptians but not of sucha character as to prejudice our own requirements.10. The third course may well not result in any agreement being reached.    It should, however, enable us to spin out the negotiations forsome time, and at worst it should strengthen our position, since we shallbe able to say that we have-made an offer which is reasonable in thecircumstances.    If, nevertheless, any agreement did result from such negotiations, it must at least provide a modus vivendi up to 1956 and ifpossible a long-term arrangement thereafter without seriously prejudicingour ability to use the Middle East base in the event of war.11. While on some grounds I should prefer to adopt the first course,I recognise that the consequences may be unacceptable, and I am on thewhole in favour of adopting the third course.H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1,30TH MARCH, 1951.
