(51) 81 COPY NO.  3120TH MARCH, 1951CABINET&apos;   OWNERSHIP OF GERMAN COAL, IRON AND STEEL industries memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Council of the Allied High Commission in Germany will shortlyhave to decide whether to allow the transfer to private owners of shares in one of the new steel companies formed under Allied High CommissionLaw No. 27 (for the reorganisation of the German coal, iron and steel industries).2. This decision involves the correct interpretation of the clause in the preamble to Law 27 which permits the German Federal Govern-ment to decide on the form of ownership in these industries.   The viewof the United States element in the High Commission is that Law 27merely enables the Federal Government to take its decision when it likes.The view of the United Kingdom element is that the Law obliges theFederal Government to take the decision on ownership before any shares in the new coal, iron and steel companies to be formed under the Law passfrom the hands of trustees and are sold on the market, and that any previoussale of shares would constitute prejudice to the Federal government&apos;s decision.3. My colleagues are asked to confirm that the United Kingdom HighCommissioner be instructed to maintain this position by the argumentsoutlined in paragraph 7 of the annexed memorandum.4.        My colleagues are asked to confirm that the United kingdom high Commissioner should:   (i)   express the view that, in order to end the present uncertainty on ownership, the Federal Government should be pressed to obtain a decision on this point as soon as possible from theFederal Parliament;  (ii) if he cannot obtain the agreement of hiscolleagues to this course, he should propose that.the Federal Governmentbe asked to express its opinion on whether the sale of shares would prejudice its own eventual decision.   Such a reference is appropriate in the light of a recent resolution by the Federal Parliament, asking boththe Federal Government and the High Commission to take no steps whichwould prejudice the Federal Government&apos;s eventual decision on the pattern of ownership in the German coal, iron and steel industries.5. My colleagues are further asked to confirm, in the light of the considerations put forward in paragraph 12 of the attached memorandum,that the United Kingdom High Commissioner should be instructed to appeal to governments, if he is outvoted on the interpretation of the&quot;ownership clause&quot;.H.M.Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,20TH MARCH, 1951.
OWNERSHIP OF GERMAN COAL? IRON AND STEEL industries. Allied policy about the ownership of the German coal, iron andsteel industries was expressed in paragraph 2 of the preamble to the tripartite Allied High Commission Law 27 which came into force inMay, 1950.   The paragraph runs as follows:-&quot;And whereas the Allied High Commission has decidedthat the question of the eventual ownership of the coal andiron and steel industries should be left to the determination of a representative, freely elected German Government&quot;.It is a repetition of the identical clause in the preamble to the Anglo-American Law 75, promulgated in November, 1948,   The French appealedin April, 1950, to Governments against this clause.   The appeal was,however, not upheld, and the French as .well as the United States and UnitedKingdom Governments must be held to be bound by the terms of the preamble.2. It has for some time been apparent that these terms are interpreteddifferently by the United States and United Kingdom elements of theAllied High Commission.   In the United States view, which seems now to be shared by the French, they mean no more than that the Federal Governmentshould be free to make in its own time, and irrespective of the imple-mentation of Law 27, a decision about the ownership of the German coal,iron and steel industries.   In the United Kingdom view, the Federal Govern-ment must make its decision on the form of ownership before Law 27is fully implemented, and in particular before the shares in the new &quot;unitcompanies&quot;, which are being formed under the Law, pass from the hands ofthe Trustees appointed to hold them and are sold on the open market.It has always been our view that if the shares were sold to private owners,the Federal Governments decision on ownership would be prejudiced.Before any shares of the &quot;unit companies&quot; are put on the market, therefore,the Allied High Commission should request the Federal Government totake the steps necessary to determine the form of ownership.3. The German attitude on the question of ownership is uncertain.The United Kingdom views on procedure are supported by a resolution adopted in November, 1950, by the German Federal Parliament.   In this resolution both the Federal Government and the Allied High commission were requested to take no action, in the course of implementation of Law 27,which would in any way prejudice a future decision by the federal government on the ownership of the basic industries.   It is, however, veryimprobable that, if the present Federal Government or Parliament were now to take such a decision, it would be in favour of any form of public ownership.   Even the Social Democrat Party and the Trade Unions inGermany have concentrated far more on attaining joint control of policyin the main individual coal and steel companies (&quot;Mitbestimmung&quot;) than onworking out plans for public ownership.  In achieving, as they have now done,a considerable degree of joint control, they have gone far towards ensuringagainst any possible revival of the old reactionary influences in Germanheavy industry.   They may in consequence be content with somethingconsiderably less than full State or public ownership of the heavy industries.It would therefore be unwise to expect that even a favourable decisionwithin the Allied High Commission on the interpretation of the preamble to law 27 would be followed in the near future by any steps on the part of theFederal Government to bring the German coal, iron and steel industries under public ownership.-1-ANNEX
6. When the proposal in paragraph 4 above is submitted to the Councilof the High Commission, the United Kingdom element of the High Commissionproposes to record its opposition on the following grounds:-(i) the preamble to Law 27 places an obligation on the AlliedAuthorities to refrain from any action which might prejudice theultimate decision by the Federal Government on the ownershipquestion;(ii) the transfer of shares to private owners at this stage would prejudice the Federal Governments decision in favour of private ownership and thus constitute a breach of the Allied High Commission&apos;obligations.It may be possible to oppose the American and french proposal on the legal ground that the Hahn/Mannesmannrestitution agreement is invalid; but it seems unlikely that wecould stand for long on this ground.7. The United Kingdom attitude will be supported by the followingarguments:-(a) the agreement of November, 1948, to resolve Anglo-American differences on the ownership question by the formula inthe preamble to Law 75 was reached only after prolongednegotiation and reference to Governments;-2-4. It is against this general background that the issue of the. interpretation of the preamble has now been raised for decision by theCouncil of the Allied High Commission.   The particular occasion ofits emergence is a complicated case of which the essential featuresare:-(a) Two of the constituent companies of the MannesmannRfchrenwerke (a large steel complex due for deconcentrationunder Law 27) are to be set up under the Allied reorganisationplans as a single &quot;unit company&quot;.(b) Shares in the two constituent companies would be transferred undera restitution agreement by Mannesmann Rtihrenwerke to a Britishfirm Hahn Brothers, who would thus become a majority holderin the new &quot;unit company&quot;.(c) The Americans propose and the French agree that the property and shares of the new &quot;Unit company&quot; should be decontrolled andreleased by the trustees who now hold them.5. In submitting this proposal to the Council of the Allied high commission and in raising the main issue of the interpretation of the preamble to Law 27, the French and Americans will argue that delay in thesale of shares, pending a decision by the Federal Government on ownership,is not required by the preamble, and that it would jeopardise Allied controlover the distribution of shares in the unit companies, thereby facilitating the resumption of control in these companies by Nazis or Nazi supporters.It must be admitted that if the decision on ownership were delayed, and ifshares were sold only after that decision, the Allies would be in a weakerposition than at present to prevent the return of former owners topositions of control.   It should, however, be possible to meet this diffi-culty and to counter any legitimate French and American fears by meansof some contractual arrangement with the Federal Government makingspecial provision against the return of the former owners.
(b) the right of the Government of any State to nationalise theproperty of its subjects is inherent in the sovereignty of that state.   There would be no necessity to reiterate an inherentright in the preamble to Law 27.(c) the law makes full provision for holding the shares of the newcompanies in Trusteeship.   These measures would have beenunnecessary had the intention been limited to deconcentratingthe old concerns and to handing over the shares in the newcompanies to new private shareholders or to the shareholdersof the old concerns;(d) When the text of the preamble was originally agreed betweenthe Military Governments, General Clay, the American military governor, evidently shared the United Kingdom view of its meaning.In his book &quot;Decision in Germany&quot; he writes (p. 329 of theEnglish edition):   &quot;The enterprises to be formed under there organisation must be held in trusteeship until a freely electedWestern German Government has determined the economic pattern of ownership for these industries&quot;.(e) To take the shares out of the hands of the Trustees at thisstage would be contrary to the resolution adopted by the german federal Parliament in November, 1950, in which the Allied high commission was requested in the course of implementation ofLaw 27 not to prejudice the question of the future ownership ofthe basic industries.8. Strong as these arguments are, it must be recognised that they willprobably not be accepted by the Americans and French (who after a long period of hesitation seem to have aligned themselves in all essentialswith the American position).   On the main problem at issue therefore theUnited Kingdom High Commissioner is likely to be outvoted by hiscolleagues.   A precedent will be created for the sale of shares of eachunit company as it is formed, and any eventual decision by the federal government will thereby be progressively prejudiced in favour of private ownership.9. It might be possible to avoid a vote and at the same time to gain our point by proposing that the Federal Government should be pressed to obtainas soon as possible a decision on the form of ownership from the federal parliament.   Such a decision would end the present state of uncertainty and could be made irrespective of the interpretation of the preamble.   It is unlikely that the Americans and French will agree to any approach to theFederal Government in this sense.   The United Kingdom High commissioner should, however, put forward the idea.10.        The United Kingdom element in Germany have suggested anotherpossible means of avoiding an immediate decision against us in theCouncil of the High Commission on the interpretation of the preamble to law 27.   They have suggested that the Federal Chancellor should be toldby the High Commissioner of the proposal put forward by the Americans andFrench, as outlined in paragraph 4 above, and asked whether in the view ofthe Federal Government such a proposal would constitute prejudice to thedecision of the ownership issue under the terms of the resolution passedby the Federal Parliament (paragraph 3 above).   Reference to the federal chancellor on this point has certain additional advantages:-
. (a)  It would show that we take the Bundestag resolutionseriously and might therefore gain us some politicalsupport from the Germans;(b) It would give the Social Democratic Party and the Trade unions is a chance to bring pressure upon the Federal Government toadopt the view which we ourselves hold about the immediate saleof shares in the unit companies.It must be recognised that the Americans and French may well opposesuch reference on the grounds indicated in paragraph 5 above; but their objections might be met, as there suggested, by our intention to make a contractual arrangement with the Federal Government ensuring againstthe return of former owners to positions of power within the new unitcompanies.11.        If this suggestion is accepted, the United Kingdom High commissioner would in the forthcoming discussion with his colleagues take the initiative in proposing the course outlined in the preceding paragraph;  only if theydid not accept this course, would he proceed to a vote on the main issue,whether the sale of shares of the &quot;Unit companies&quot; to private owners before a general decision by the Federal Government on ownership is contrary tothe terms of the preamble to Law 27.   At the same time he could findmeans of making it clear to the Germans that he has tried to safeguard theinterests of the Bundestag in this case.12.        If the United Kingdom High Commissioner is outvoted on the inter-pretaticn of the preamble it is undoubtedly open to him to appeal to governments under paragraph 7(b) of the Agreement on TripartiteControls, which permits any High Commissioner to appeal when in hisopinion a majority decision of the Council conflicts with an inter-governmental agreement relating to any of the subjects in paragraphs 2(a)and (b) of the Occupation State (which include &quot;deconcentration&quot;).   the preamble to Law 27 certainly represents an intergovernmental agreementof this nature, and the American interpretation of it is contrary to the sense of that agreement as accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government.   Butif the decision goes against us in the High Commission, there is little prospect of getting it reversed at governmental level.   Nevertheless, theAnglo-American difference on this point in the High Commission isof such importance that it must if necessary be referred to Governments;and it is recommended that the United Kingdom High Commissioner be instructed to appeal to Governments if he is outvoted on the inter-pretation of the preamble to Law 27.Foreign Office, S.
