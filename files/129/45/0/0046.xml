THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp. (51) 121 COPY NO.  &quot;It1ST IVIAY, 1951CABINETPARLIAMENT AND THE SOCIALISED industries memorandum by the Home secretary i should be glad of the views of my colleagues on the reply whichshould be sent to a request from the Opposition through the usual channelsthat a Select Committee should be set up with the following terms ofreference:-&quot;To consider the present methods by which the House ofCommons is informed on the affairs of the nationalised industries and to report what changes are necessary in the practice orprocedure of the House to improve these methods and to enablethe House to exercise an effective measure of control over these industries. &quot;2.       Whatever may be decided about the principle of an inquiry, these terms of reference are obviously unacceptable.   It is indeed hard tobelieve that any party would want the House of Commons to be able toexercise &quot;effective control&quot; over the socialised industries, and since theOpposition have always agreed in the past that the socialised industries should be free from meticulous political supervision of their day to day management, I conclude that the Opposition do not mean what their draftactually says and that their drafting has gone astray.3.       The danger of conceding an inquiry is none the less that theOpposition might use it irresponsibly as a method of pressing for formsof Parliamentary control which would be prejudicial to the commercialefficiency of the Boards, and they might have some support from Govern-ment back-benchers in proposals whose ostensible purpose was to extend the authority of Parliament.4.       On the other hand, there has for some time been a widespreadfeeling among all parties that the present arrangements are not entirely satisfactory, and that Parliament ought to be exerting more control over these great publicly owned monopolies.   The Government have on several occasions said that they would be glad to listen to suggestions for improvements, provided that the efficiency of the Boards would not been dangered, and I think that it is true to say that, on the whole, the problem has been approached in a reasonable and non-partisan spirit by all parties.It may be doubted whether an inquiry would lead very far in practice, but itmight at least serve the purpose of emphasising the real difficulty of theproblem and showing that there are no short cuts to its solution.
%   -5..   &apos;   If we should decide to turn down the Opposition&apos;s request, we canjustifiably do so on the grounds that the inquiry would not be likely toproduce practical results, and that the suggested terms of reference showa complete misconception of the problem.   If, however, there is to bean inquiry, we should have to insist upon revised terms of reference.The simplest course would probably be to delete the words after &quot;these methods&quot;.   The emphasis would then be on methods of &quot;informing&quot; theHouse and there would be less risk of the Select Committee rangingover the settled questions of policy.J a C . E .Home Office, S. W. 1. ,1ST MAY, 1951.
