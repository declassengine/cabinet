BALANCE OF CIVIL PAYReport by the Chairman of an Official CommitteeIn C.P.(50) 274 the Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested thatthe practice should be discontinued in any future war of paying civilservants called up for military service the difference between their civil and their military pay.    After considering his arguments and the counter arguments of the Minister of.Defence (C.P.(51) 2) and of theHome Secretary (CP.(50) 3A5), the Cabinet (C.M.(5l) 4th Conclusions,Minute 2) invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for officials of the Departments concerned to consider the issue raised in greater detail.2. The Chancellor directed that the Treasury should look into thismatter in consultation with-representatives of the -Service and Supply DepartmentsMinistry of defence ministry of LabourPost office ministry of pensions ministry of education ministry of HealthHome office ministry of TransportInland RevenueIn making this report our object has been:-(a) to present the factual information insofar as it can beobtained;(b) to summarise again the arguments for and against the con-tinuance of the system.A,    Factual information. The scope of the problem.     This problem is not confined to theCivil Service.    In the last war civil pay was made up not only by theCivil Service but by local authorities to teachers and other local govern-ment servants and by the police, i. e. the practice covered the whole field of public employment.    The range of public employment has since greatlyextended and if balance of civil pay continues in any future war in the oldpublic employments, it will inevitably extend to the new - the Public boards and the National Health Service,    These new public employments havestaff (including industrials) of some 2.4 millions compared with the 2. millions staff in the old public employments, and the tendency of private employers to follow the same practice would undoubtedly be stimulated by the extension of the practice to this wider field of public employment.In short, if balance of civil pay is paid in any future war in the CivilService, a substantial proportion of the total population of the country islikely to get the same treatment.4. The effect on this problem of improvements in Service pay.The Government have not yet decided whether conscripts in any future war are to have the improved rates now paid to regulars or whether they shouldreceive the rates in force before the recent improvements.    Clearly the-1-
number of persons to whom balance of civil pay would be issued will be considerably affected by this decision.    But it may help the Cabinet ifthey are given some indication under both alternatives of the type ofpublic employee likely to benefit from balance of civil pay,5. The improved rates of Service pay for regulars under thelatest improvements give the following annual rates of cash remunera-tion:-Single Married(a) On enlistment  127. 15s. Od  237. 5s. Od(b) On promotion to      &apos; 219  328. 10s. OdCorporal(c) On promotion to         301. 2s. 6d  428.17s. 6dSergeantThe earlier rates now payable to conscripts during their firstmonths of service give the following annual remuneration:-S ingle Married(a) On enlistment  73  164. 5s. Od(b) On promotion to         136.17s. 6d  228. 2s. 6dCorporal(c) On promotion to         191.12s. 6d  295. 18s. OdSergeantIt will be seen from these figures that, even if regular rates were given to conscripts in a future war, the only public servants whowould not receive balance of civil pay would be those earning less thanbetween  130and  240 on enlistment or less than  220 to  330 and  300to  430 on promotion to Corporal and Sergeant respectively.    what proportion of the public service which is likely to be conscripted would fall in this category?    Clearly, the answer to this question cannot begiven with any precision, but it is obvious that a very considerablenumber of public servants would draw balance of civil pay for part, ifnot all, of their military service.All industrial civil servants get a minimum annual rate of  280;the postmen are at about the same level;  the clerks get  230 at age 20;the Executives  300 at the same age and rise by annual increments to 410 and  535 respectively at age 30.    These classes together account for 75 per cent of the whole Civil Service and clearly for a far higher proportion of that part of the Civil Service which is likely to be called up.    The position in the other public services is broadly comparable.All industrials get more than the lower rates even of Regular Service pay and a high proportion of the clerical staff are in the same position.    the broad conclusion is that, despite the recent improvements in Service pay,the cash emoluments of public servants (which, unlike Service rates, are&quot;not supplemented by very valuable emoluments in kind) are likely to exceed Service pay in the case of a wide range of those public servantsthat are called up.
i 5 36. The probable cost of balance of civil pay.   All we can say onthis is that no reliable estimate can be produced but that the cost would certainly be considerable.    We do not even know what the systemcost in the 1939 war except in the Post Office where the charge for thewhole war period was  23 millions.    From the Post Office figure, we might assume that for the Civil Service as a whole the charge mighthave been some  50 millions.    Whether it would be less or more inany future war is a matter of conjecture.   As we have shown in para-graph 5, it is doubtful whether the recent improvements in Service payare likely, if applied generally in time of war, to reduce appreciably thenumber of civil servants eligible for balance of civil pay, though theamount of balance of civil pay which they would draw would of course be pro tanto diminished.    But certainly whatever reduction resulted from this cause would be cancelled by the widening of the field of publicemployment.    The entry of the socialised industries and the national health Service into the group of public services eligible for civil pay would result in a considerable number of public servants being added tothe list eligible for balance of civil pay.    Our conclusion, basedadmittedly on conjecture, is that balance of civil pay in any future war,if administered on the present basis, would not be appreciably cheaperthan in the 1939 war.7. The effect of taking home savings, into account.    In previouswars the civil servant has been paid the difference between his civil pay and the cash paid by the Services.    In any future war we feel that itwould be reasonable to take into account not only actual Service pay butalso the savings in personal expenditure (food and clothing are the mostobvious) that occur when a civil servant joins the Forces.    These mightfairly be assessed at 27s. 6d for a married and 47s. 6d for a single man.If this were done the number of civil servants who would be ineligiblefor balance of civil pay would be increased - and the cost of coursereduced.8. , The cost of an improved War Service Grants Scheme.    It hasbeen suggested that if the system of balance of civil pay were discon-tinued it would be necessary to extend the scope of the War ServiceGrants scheme.    The object of this scheme is to deal with hardshipsresulting in individual cases from call-up.    At present this scheme infact can only give full cover on the lower salary ranges since themaximum grant is  150a year.    It should be noted that this maximumwas fixed at an early stage in the last war and would probably have tobe increased whatever the decision on balance of civil pay.    If balanceof civil pay were abolished it has been suggested that the scope of thescheme should be extended to prevent actual hardship arising from the call-up of public servants in the higher as well as in the lower salary&apos;bands.    For example, a civil servant on  700 a year with a wife andthree children and serving in the ranks would be hard put to it to main-tain his wife and family and keep up unavoidable commitments of rent,etc. , within a maximum grant of  150.    What would be the effect ofincreasing the scope of this scheme in this way?(a)    It is submitted that the number of additional cases that wouldbe brought within the scope of this scheme would be compara-tively small.    The far greater number of those called up arethose within the lower salary bands whose cases would bedealt with adequately within the existing limits.    Those whowould be added to the scheme by the raising of the limit wouldbe comparatively small in number.
(b)    For this reason the additional administration would be com-paratively small as would be the additional costs.    V/e are quite unable to estimate what would be the additionalnumbers or the additional cost.    Indeed, we do not know what might be the cost of administering the War ServiceGrants scheme on the same basis as in the last war.During the eight years 1940 to 1947 total grants amounted to 75 millions with grants in a peak year totalling  18 millions and the total number of awards was about one million.Higher Service pay, so far as it applied to the Forces in timeof warj would, of course, reduce the number of cases outsideas well as inside the public services.    Our conclusion is thatany improvement in the War Service Grants scheme on thelines we have suggested would add very little to the total bill.Moreover, such a scheme would inevitably be cheaper thanbalance of civil pay, mainly because it would not take intoaccount increments in the Civil Service.    At the same timeincreases of Service pay would lead to reductions in theamount of grant and no grants whatever are payable in respectof single men without dependants or commitments.    There is,however, the general objection to the extension of any such scheme as an alternative to balance of civil pay, in that its administration must involve something in the nature of a&quot;means test&quot;.9. The burden of administration of balance of civil pay.    The   -administration of the balance of civil pay scheme involves a very con-siderable amount of clerking.     The civil servant himself nominates theperson to receive balance of civil pay and payment is made by the Depart-ment.    Changes in Service emoluments have to be notified immediately to the Civil Department and acknowledgments obtained, and the Depart-ment adjusts the balance of civil pay and notifies to the Service PayingAuthority the amount of any over-issues of civil pay to be deducted fromthe Service emoluments.    In the case of service overseas some intervalwill necessarily elapse between the date from which the Service emolu-ment is increased and the date when the balance of civil pay can bereduced.    During this period there will necessarily be an over-issue ofcivil pay.    In order that the dependant to whom balance of civil pay is payable may not be inconvenienced these over-issues of balance of civilpay are normally deducted from Navy, Army or Air Force emoluments.The burden of administration falls, therefore, not only on the CivilDepartment but on the Paymaster, particularly as notifications of changesin civil pay reach the Paymaster often at a considerable interval after the effective date and adjustments have to be made from future pay to produce the correct eventual payment.    Even if the administration were to besimplified in some respects, it would still remain formidable, whereasmost of the work would disappear if balance of civil pay were discontinued.10. The burden of administration of the War Service Grants Scheme.For the reasons which we have given in paragraph 7 above, we do notconsider that any extension of the scope of the War Service grants scheme is in itself likely to add appreciably to the cost of administration.Clearly, however, the number of cases to be dealt with under the grants scheme would be increased by applications from those who, had they received balance of civil pay, would have been ineligible for grant.
-    J5S^*    The arguments for and against balance of civil pay11. We recapitulate the arguments for and against balance ofcivil pay.Arguments in favour of civil pay:-(a) Under conscription and the policy of reserved occupations aman has no choice as to the part he plays in a war.    It isunjust that the family of a man called up to the Armed forces should suffer financailly compared with that of his colleagueretained in civilian employment.    The comparison whichwill seem to those concerned the immediate and obvious onewill be between two colleagues, one of whom is called up andone of whom is not.    The comparison between men coming tothe Forces from different civil occupations, one grantingbalance of civil pay and one not, will not seem so direct andanomalous.(b) The public will expect that the system sanctified by the prac-tice of the last three wars will be continued in a future war.In particular those civil servants who had permission from,their Departments to join the Territorial Army and the Navaland Air   Force Reserves presumably did so in the belief that they would receive balance of civil pay if they were called up in an emergency.(c) Even if the Government decided against balance of civil pay,some other employers wuld almost certainly regard it as their duty to give it to the. families of their employees.    TheGovernment ought to offer better treatment to public servantsthan that accorded by the less generous employers to their staff.    Otherwise there will be an embarrassing distinctionbetween &quot;good employer&quot; policy and Government policy.But, apart from this, it can fairly be said that the Govern-ment, as an employer, should and does take great care overthe selection of its employees and demands high standards of efficiency and conduct.    In return it gives an expectation ofa certain standard of living over a period of years.    It has,therefore, an obligation to mitigate, so far as possible, anydrop in this standard when an employee is called away tocarry out his duties as a citizen.(d) The alternative to the balance of civil pay is not complete dis-regard of hardships but more extensive provision to meet them.    But any scheme for special grants like the NationalService Grants involves investigation into a manrs commit-ments and a means test of this kind is bound to be unpopular.(e) Over the next few years, very large numbers of Class Z andClass G reservists will be required on mobilisation and in thefirst few months thereafter as reinforcements for the Forces.The great majority of these men will have received balanceof civil pay in the recent war, and will no doubt be confidentlycounting on receiving it if called up in a future emergency.It could not but have an adverse effect on their morale if, ata time when they are being called upon to do periods oftraining, they were told that they would not receive balanceof civil pay if called up in a future emergency.
Arguments against balance of civil pay(a) &quot;the original object of balance of civil pay was to encouragevolunteering.    In the 1939 war balance of civil pay was con-tinued despite the fact that conscription was operative fromthe outset.    In any future war conscription will undoubtedlycome into force immediately, and the original motive forbalance of civil pay has therefore disappeared.    At the sametime, announcement of a decision to discontinue balance ofcivil pay in war wo Id almost certainly operate to the detriment of peace-time recruiting to the Auxiliary and reserve Forces, the building up of whose volunteer nucleusis particularly necessary over the next three or four years.(b) Forces pay was once very small indeed and for the family man with commitments, balance of civil pay was the sole protection against possibly very considerable hardship.    The presentposition is very different.    Forces pay is greatly improved and the supplementary family allowances (not to mention thesocial services generally) go some way towards meeting the married man&apos;s commitments.    National Service Grants willbe available as in the past to help men in the Forces to meet their continuing civil liabilities.(c) Men and women in the Forces who have no balance of civil paywill contend that there is no justification for giving bettertreatment to civil servants or to persons employed by public or semi-public bodies.    The wider the field over whichbalance of civil pay is given the greater will be the sense ofinjustice among those whose pay is not made up.(d) Hardships will undoubtedly occur as a result of the call-up ofpublic servants who have family commitments, but the rightway to deal with such hardships is through the NationalService Grants system, which gives help where it is needed,and not through the balance of civil pay system, which helpsindiscriminately those with and without commitments.(e) On the face of it the discontinuance of balance of civil pay evenaccompanied by an extension of the scope of the War ServiceGrants scheme should produce savings both in cash and inman-power.12. Conclusion.- .   The arguments are undoubtedly closely balanced.As far as we can see the discontinuance of civil pay would save bothmoney and man-power.    But undoubtedly such a decision would raise thepolitical difficulties to which we have drawn attention.    It seems to us,therefore, that the decision must be taken largely on political considera-tions.    Ministers will no doubt agree that whatever decision is takenshould apply in principle in peace as well as in war.    Thus, if Ministersdecide that balance of civil pay is to be discontinued in peace it must be with the firm intention that such a policy will be continued even if war broke out.13. The position of the Z Reservists.     If Ministers decide thatbalance of civil pay is to be continued special problems arise in connec-tion with the Z Reservists. These will be examined urgently as soon asa decision on the main question has been reached.(Signed)  T. PADMORE14th March, 1951. Chairman of the Committee.-6-
