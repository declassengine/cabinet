confidential cp. (51) 11625TH APRIL) 1951.  .  cabinet national HEALTH SERVICE bill memorandum by the Minister of Health and theSecretary of State for scotland we are much concerned about the effect of the lapse oftime before the charges for dentures and spectacles contemplated by this Bill can be brought into operation and we feel our colleaguesought to have the following resume of the present situation,2. Applications for dentures have practically doubled sincethe chancellor^ announcement of impending charges.3. For spectacles comprehensive figures are not availablebut enquiries of the three largest Executive Councils in the countrysuggest that the rate of application has increased by about 25%,(Mr, W. Griffiths (Manchester Exchange) referred to this increase inhis remarks during the Second Reading debate on 24th April,)Similar increases began in Scotland during March following a predictionthat charges would be imposed which was carried in a widely-readScottish newspaper at the end of February.4. The charges imposed under the Bill will not, of course, applyto these cases.5. The estimate of  12,, 5 millions as the savings under the Billfor the first year was based on the assumption that the charges, would come into operation as originally planned within a few days of theBudget statement, i. e, the 13th April.   The evidence as to demandmentioned above suggests that these savings will be reduced at nearlytwice the normal pro rata rate during the period between the Budget andthe operation of the charges.6. This makes it imperative that the period before the charges are in force should be cut to a minimum and we should like, in thisconnection, to refer specially to the following two points.7, We shall be strongly pressed to find an alternative to theNational Assistance Board for assessing whether particular individualsshould be assisted to pay the charge.   Leaving aside the fact that theintention of this suggestion is that the alternative should be less effective in applying the charges, no suitable alternative is in existence.(The Executive Councils, which have been suggested, are totally unfittedby constitution, staffing and experience to undertake such a task).If new machinery has to be created, staffed and brought into operationthis must result in considerable additional delay before the chargescan operate.   Unless we are to lose still more of the savings whichshould result from the Bill this suggestion must be resisted.COPY NO.-?/THIS-document-T- IS-THE PROPERT-Y-OF HIS-BRITANNIC-MAJESTY-&apos;S -GOVERNMENT-
8. We are also very anxious, for the reasons given above, thatthe Bill should receive the Royal Assent at the earliest possible moment.   Even when the Bill is passed, a few days must elapse beforethe charges can operate to allow for the making, printing and distri-bution of the Regulations and other documents, and, if the Bill does notbecbme law before Whitsun, it will be mid-June before the charges canstart to apply.   At the present rate of demand this would mean the sacrifice of between  5 and  6 millions of the savings estimated for the current year, i. e. a reduction from  12. 5 millions to  7 millions.We therefore greatly hope that it will be found possible to pass theBill into law before Whitsun.H.A.M.H, McN.25th April, 1951.-2-
