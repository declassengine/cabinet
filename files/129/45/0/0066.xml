jfllS-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(51) 141 COPY NO. 3 I24TH MAY, 1951CABINETCOLONIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONDEBATE ON THE ANNUAL report memorandum by the Minister of State for Colonial affairs as Ministers will know, the Annual Report of the Colonial Develop-ment Corporation is to be discussed in the House of Commons on Tuesday,29th May, and I fear that the question of responsibility for the failure of theGambia Poultry Scheme will undoubtedly be raised.    The Board of theCorporation are anxious that a statement should be made by the Governmentrefuting Lord Trefgarne&apos;s charges in his personal statement in the Lords,and Lord Reith has sent me a letter enclosing suggestions for the line to betaken by Lord Ogmore, who will be speaking for the Government in the Houseof Lords when the Corporation^ report is debated there on 13th June. -Lord Reith has also asked me to make a statement in the Commons,2. The main lines of the statement that Lord Reith and the membersof the Board of the Corporation wish the Government to make are asfollows:-(1)    Lord Trefgarne assumed direct charge of the scheme in July,1948, when he minuted:   &quot;This project appears to have become involved with various points of principle.    I have therefore decided to take direct charge of it from now on. &quot;(2)    Lord Trefgarne withheld from the Board adverse reports andoverrode technical advice from three of his senior officerswithout passing the opinions of the latter on to the Board.3. The Corporation also wish the Government to quote a letter written by Lord Trefgarne to the then Chancellor in September, 1948, in which he described the American Manager of the scheme, who has since been dismissed,as &quot;probably one of the greatest poultry experts and tropical farmers in theworld&quot;.4. I do not think that it would be at all wise to make a statement on thelines proposed by the Board, and I would naturally like, if possible, to avoidreviving the issue at all, particularly in view of the fact that the whole matterconcerns internal administration of the Corporation, for which the government does not accept responsibility.    It is possible, however, that there will bevery strong pressure for a definite statement by the Government, and in that case it would seem that the only way of avoiding the necessity for such astatement would be to concede some form of enquiry.    While I should wishto avoid this if at all possible, I should like the agreement of Ministers thatI should, if absolutely necessary, announce that Lord Reith had asked theSecretary of State formally to institute such an enquiry and that he had agreedto do so.J.D.Colonial Office, S.W.1,24TH MAY, 1951.
