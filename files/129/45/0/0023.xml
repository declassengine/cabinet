ECONOMIC AID TO YUGOSLAVIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the President of the Board of trade at their meeting on 20th October, 1950, the Cabinet considered amemorandum (C.P.(5D) 234) by the Foreign Secretary and the Presidentof the Board of Trade recommending immediate measures to avert a collapse of the Yugoslav regime, since its collapse would have the mostserious consequences for our defence and foreign policy (CM.(50) 66thConclusions, Minute 2).    The Cabinet:-(1)    Authorised the grant to Yugoslavia of credits, not exceeding 5 millions, for the purchase of consumer goods and sterlingfoodstuffs.(2)    Authorised the Foreign Secretary and the President of the Boardof Trade to proceed with the detailed arrangements set out inparagraph 12 of C.P.(50) 234.(3)    Invited the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the President of the Board of Trade to consider, in thelight of the Cabinefs decision, how the economic and technicalmissions which it was proposed to send to Yugoslavia could best be organised.2. In accordance with paragraph 12(b) of C.P,(50) 234,  3 millionswere made available to the Yugoslav Government in November, 1950, forthe purchase of foodstuffs and consumer goods.    As the United StatesGovernment were able to supply food more quickly than we had expected andas the Yugoslavs urged that the supply of raw materials was the more urgent problem, it was decided by agreement between the Foreign Secretary,the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade (seeannexed minute from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs of the 19th December, 1950) that the remaining  2 millions of the  5 millions authorised by the Cabinet should be used for the purchaseof raw materials.    Paragraph 3 of that minute forecast a Yugoslav deficit in sterling alone over the next few months of about  2^ millions per month and pointed out that our policy of &quot;keeping Tito afloat&quot; would probablyrequire further substantial sums before the activities of our economic mission could produce useful results.3. The programme for the use of the two credits has been agreed between the Yugoslavs and the Economic Mission, which was set up in belgrade in accordance with paragraph 12(b) (ii) of C.P.(50) 234, under the leadership of Sir Francis Mudie.    The Economic Mission has so far been examining with the Yugoslav authorities the general balance of payments,-1-IrHiS -DOG4JMENT-IS- T-H45-PROPERTY--0-F HIS BRIT-britannic majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(51) 98 COPY NO.   g ]2ND APRIL, 1951CABINET
on current and on capital account.    The Yugoslavs have been most co-operative and ready to disclose confidential information.    The pictureis not yet complete, but the estimates both of our Economic Mission andof the State Department suggests that, omitting any repayment of debtson &quot;swings&quot; or trade overdrafts (which are estimated to amount to about 20 millions), the Yugoslavs are faced with a world deficit in 1951 ofwhich at least  25 millions is uncovered by credits now available.    this figure of  25 millions is subject to a large margin of error either way,4, We are now discussing with the Americans at the official levelYugoslav current account difficulties and we hope later to discuss withthem and the International Bank Yugoslavia^ long-term investment pro-gramme.    We also wish soon to discuss these problems with othercountries in an effort to spread the load at least to the extent of per-suading these countries not to insist on the immediate repayment of debtsdue to them from Yugoslavia.    In the light of these discussions and of an interim report which we have just received from our Economic Mission,we expect to put further proposals before our colleagues.    These proposals will almost certainly involve further substantial credits or grants to Yugo-slavia from this country and the United States.5. Meanwhile we must decide on an urgent Yugoslav request for afurther credit of  4 millions for the purchase of raw materials, such aswool, hides, rubber and cotton yarn.    The United States Government havealso been asked for a credit of 20 million dollars for the purchase of other raw materials;  we understand that the State Department are taking urgentsteps to meet this in full out of funds already appropriated.    We and the americans hope that these sums will tide, the Yugoslavs over, pendingdetailed consideration with the United States Government of our future policy.    We consider that this is a suitable opportunity to warn the Yugo-slavs that the continuance of British aid on anything like the present scalewill depend on our being satisfied that the Yugoslavs are determined to balance their foreign payments in the near future and that their planningpolicy is such as will bring about this result.6, We recommend that, in advance of consideration of the main problem of how best Tito&apos;s short-term current account difficulties canbe met, His Majestyfs Government should agree to make available to yugoslavia at once a further credit of  4 millions for raw materials onthe same terms as the previous credit of  5 millions, and subject to the warning mentioned above.H.M.H.W.2nd April, 1951.
ANNEX   .-Minute of 19th December, 1950, from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the President of theBoard of TradeECONOMIC AID TO YUGOSLAVIAThe Cabinet decided on 20th October that in an effort to avert a collapse of the Yugoslav regime owing to the present severe economiccrisis, which would have the most serious consequences for our defence and foreign policy, we should offer the Yugoslav Government a credit of 3 millions for food, consumer goods and any consequential requirements,keeping a further  2 millions in reserve.    The offer has been duly made and accepted.    Meanwhile there have been developments which suggestthat the  2 millions which we hold in reserve should be offered to the yugoslavs immediately and should, be devoted to the purchase of rawmaterials rather than food and consumer goods.2. The United States Government, whose co-operation in our reliefenterprise the Cabinet made a condition of our own action, have offered and organised shipments of food more promptly than we had expected and onsuch a scale as to remove the danger of famine for the time being.    the yugoslav Government informed us in November that if they did not receivefurther credit facilities from the United Kingdom, they would have to defaultpublicly in December on their sterling debts.    Although we have managed,by relaxing certain stipulations regarding the credits we granted a year ago,to tide the Yugoslavs over their immediate difficulties, their shortage of sterling remains acute.    This is critical because they have also informed us that they will have insufficient sterling to keep up a minimum flow ofraw materials (e. g. wool, cotton, hides and rubber) into their factories inthe early part of 1951.    Some of these must be bought in January and february for seasonal reasons.   It is therefore clear that the supply ofraw materials is more urgently needed than that of food.    This has apolitical aspect because a stoppage in the flow of raw materials would indue course lead to the closure of factories, unemployment and a consequentthreat to the regime.3. My proposal deals only with Yugoslavia^ minimum sterlingrequirements in January and February, but I feel bound to point out that theprospect for 1951 is very disturbing.    Our knowledge of the Yugoslavbalance of payments with the rest of the world is very incomplete as the yugoslavs have not revealed the details to us.    But in connection with their request for further credits they have disclosed information about their sterling balance of payments for 1950.    This indicates a total deficit of  10millions financed by credits from the United Kingdom.    The sterlingbalance of payments for 1951 depends on Yugoslav trade policy, stocks,world prices and other factors which can only be evaluated after considerable further study by the Economic Mission which, in accordance with theCabinet decision, we are sending out to supervise the distribution of food and consumer goods.    The Yugoslav Governments own rough forecast,however, shows a deficit in the next few months of about  2^ millions per month compared with just over  1 million per month recently, but pendinginvestigation this should be treated with reserve.    Moreover the sterling
balance of payments cannot be properly interpreted in isolation from thegeneral balance of payments.    At this stage I would merely draw theattention of my colleagues to the probability that our policy of keepingTito &quot;afloat&quot; will involve the prospect of further substantial subventionsfor the purchase of essential goods in the coming months.    Any beneficial effect from the activities of our Economic Mission cannot be expected fora little time.4. 1 accordingly recommend that we should offer the yugoslav government immediately the remaining  2 millions of the  5 millions,which we are now holding in reserve, and that this, together with any partof the  3 millions not immediately needed for its original purpose, maybe devoted to the purchase of urgent raw materials.    In making this offer we should leave the Yugoslavs in no doubt that we have not yetsatisfied ourselves about their raw material position, that the  2 millionsrepresented a stopgap, and that further intensive study would still berequired in Belgrade.    I would propose to ask the Yugoslav ambassador to call and hand him a note conveying the offer,5. I am sending a similar minute to Hugh Gaitskell.(Sgd.)  ERNEST DA VIES.
