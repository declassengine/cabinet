April1951CONFIDENTIALC,P. (51) 11726th April, 1951   &apos;THE STONE OF SGONEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i have been considering, in the light of the discussion at our meeting on19th April (CM. (51) 29th Conclusions, Minute 4), and of Scottish opinion so faras I can assess it, whether it would be right to tender any advice to His majesty in regard to the arrangements for the future custody of the Coronation Stone.It may be useful as a background to our discussion if I append to thisMemorandum a copy of a note which was furnished to me by the HistoriographerRoyal for Scotland dealing with the history of the Stone.There are, I think, three possibilities which we ought carefully to consider:  (1) To leave the Stone in the AbbeyThe Stone has been in Westminster Abbey for over 650 years a longer period than it can be shown to have been in use at the Coronation of Scottish or PictishKings. Since 1707 it has been used at the Coronation of Kings and Queens of theUnited Kingdom and has thus acquired an imperial as distinct from a Scottishsignificance. I assume that it will be the general wish, both in Scotland and inother parts of the United Kingdom, that the Stone should continue to be used atCoronation ceremonies and it can therefore be represented as natural and properthat it should remain with the Coronation Chair in Westminster Abbey, where theseCoronations will no doubt take place.There has been no significant demand until the Stone was brought intoprominence by its removal from the Abbey last Christmas for its return to scotland. No reference is made to it in the Treaty of Union, which deals at some length with heraldic and ceremonial matters and with the custody of Scottishrecords. Mr. Kirkwood in 1924 was given leave to bring in a Bill providing forthe transfer of the.Stone to the Palace of Holyroodhouse but the Bui appears tohave been treated lightly. Since that date the Scottish Office has received practically no representations on the subject of the Stone at all.It has also to be noted that in present circumstances there is no obvious and generally accepted home for the Stone in Scotland. Dunstaffnage, Iona and Sconeall have some sort of claim; and claims might also be made on behalf of St. GilesCathedral, Edinburgh Castle, Stirling Castle and other places of importance in scottish history. Some of these places, such as Dunstaffnage, Scone and lona,seem to me to be out of the question. St. Giles Cathedral, which might have con-siderable support, does not have the national or imperial significance of westminster abbey and I do not myself consider it a proper place for the permanent accommoda-tion of the Stone. The Stone must, I think, if it is removed to Scotland, be placedin a consecrated building, and I am disposed to regard the choice as narrowed toSt. magaret&apos;s Chapel in Edinburgh Castle or the Chapel Royal in Stirling Castle.I could not claim, however, that either of these places would be universally accepted in Scotland as appropriate.Finally, I do not think that we can overlook the fact that if the Stone is returnedto Scotland it would tend either to be looked upon as a dead symbol of an extinctScottish monarchy like the Scottish Regalia now displayed in Edinburgh Castle or as a symbol of Scottish political aspirations.4049811Copy No.CABINET
(2) To Return the Stone to Scotland for Custody between CoronationsWhile I recognise the force of the considerations set out in the foregoing para-graphs in favour of leaving the Stone in Westminster Abbey, I feel bound to stressthat there is a strong feeling in Scotland, among moderate opinion as well as among those who are vocal in support of some form of home rule, which favours thetransfer,of the Stone to custody in Scotland on the clear understanding that it willcontinue to be made available for future Coronations and to be used at theseceremonies in the same way as it has been in the past. Those who support theclaim for the return of the Stone to Scotland point out that it came originally fromScone; that at the time of its removal it had acquired a special significance in relationto the crowning of Scottish Kings; that at the time of the Treaty of Northamptonin 1328 it was certainly intended that it should be restored to Scotland; and that inrecent years Scottish historical records, which were removed to England by Edward Iat the same time as the Coronation Stone, have been returned in accordance with legislation passed by the United Kingdom Parliament.My own feeling is that Scotland would respond to a decision by The king to restore the Stone to Scottish custody. If such a decision were taken I suggestthat the proper place for the accommodation of the Stone is St. magaret&apos;s Chapelin the Castle of Edinburgh. This is probably the oldest ecclesiastical building inScotland and is in the heart of a Castle which is generally regarded as Scottishrather than local and which has acquired a national significance of a special ;kindsince the opening of the Scottish National War Memorial there after the 1914-18War. The Castle already houses the Scottish Regalia; and the Coronation Stonecould, like the Regalia, be made the responsibility of the Great Officers of State.It would therefore be housed in a consecrated building, in Crown property andunder the custody of Scottish officers; and there could be no criticism, as there might be if it were sent elsewhere, that it was being placed in local or denomination-tional hands.It has been suggested that, if the transfer is to be made, it should take place during the period in June of this year when The King is resident in Edinburgh. Ifind this suggestion attractive. My idea would be that the Stone should be trans-ferred from Westminster Abbey to St. Margaret&apos;s Chapel with the minimum ofceremony or, perhaps, without any ceremony at all; that an announcement of thetransfer should be made after it is completed; and that it should be suggested toHis Majesty that he should then visit the Stone in its new home where he would bereceived by the Great Officers and where perhaps some very simple ceremonymight be held.(3) To Arrange for the Coronation Stone to be Displayed in the Various.*. ,.. *   -   Commonwealth CapitalsA third suggestion, which also has its attractions, is that in view of the wide-spread interest which has been excited by the recent removal and recovery of theStone, the opportunity should be taken of displaying it in the various parts of theCommonwealth as a symbol of the common Crown. If such an arrangement wereto be made the Stone might first be displayed in Edinburgh for such a temporarydisplay I should see less objection to the choice of St. Giles Cathedral which hasadvantages of size and accessibility-and thereafter in Wales/ Northern Ireland andthe other Commonwealth countries. By the time such a tour had been completedpopular interest in the Stone might have receded to a point at which its return to westminster Abbey would be practicable; if not, a decision as to its permanentresting place could at least be taken in an atmosphere less influenced by the events of recent months than the atmosphere in which the matter has to be considered atpresent.. 1* My own preference is for the second of the three possibilities outlined above.The return of the Stone to Scotland would, I am sure, be regarded by moderate opinion in Scotland as a generous gesture and I think that once it had been made,interest in the matter would quickly die down. If the Stone remains in the Abbey-tire must expect a continuing agitation not only by the nationalist movement butby the Church of Scotland which is being very vocal in the matter and from otherquarters. The third alternative has the merit of a half-way house; but I think itmerely postpones rather than avoids a difficult decision;     ^   v 1     t;&quot; &quot;v;:. v;&quot;&apos;; h\:&apos;ri H: McN.Scottish Office, S.W. 1, : 1 r26th April, 1951.
;:tl8 WSS \ 28 V S S    annex 1:H;;   \ %: \.&apos;    u The Stone of Destiny or Coronation StoneNote by Dr. Henry Meikle, Historiographer Royal for Scotland     j-.According to the well-known legend the Stone served as the pillow for the:Patriarch Jacob at Bethel. It was brought to Scotland, so the story goes, by Scotaand her followers from Egypt, found its way to Dunstaffnage, then to lona, and finally to Scone. William Skene, Historiographer Royal in 1869, traced the historyof the Stone and proved that it was &quot; never any where but at Scone,&quot; and that &quot; first the Kings of the Pictish monarchy, and afterwards of the Scottish kingdoms whichsucceeded it, were inaugurated on this Stone.&quot; It had no connexion with thecorresponding Irish Stone, the Lia Fail, at Tara,.as is sometimes asserted. Accor-ding to James Geikie, the geologist, the Stone is of sandstone from the district of Scone.The last King of Scotland to be &quot;placed on the Stone &quot; was John Balliol (1292).He rebelled against his overlord, King Edward I of England, who thereupon invadedScotland. In August 1296 he was at Scone and sent the Stone to London to beplaced in Westmister Abbey. To London he also sent certain Scottish munimentsfrom Edinburgh Castle, and from Holyrood Abbey the Black Rood, believed tobe a part of the True Cross.As a result of the Battle of Bannockburn and subsequent victories, the Englishrecognised the independence of Scotland by a treaty concluded at Edinburgh inMarch 1328 and confirmed by the English Parliament at Northampton in July ,1328.It provided, inter alia, for the return of the Scottish muniments under certain conditions. Nothing, however, was done; and it was not until after the passingof the Public Records (Scotland) Act, 1937, that nine documents, identified as beingamong those sent to London by Edward I, were transmitted by the Master of the rolls to His Majesty&apos;s Register House, Edinburgh.No provision was made in the extant texts of the Treaty for the return either of the Stone or of the Black Rood. Some documents, however, may not havesurvived. But the English chroniclers refer to matters not found in the officialrecords of the Treaty; and those relating to the Stone are confirmed by two writsissued under the English Privy Seal. The first, dated 1st July, 1328, directed tothe Abbot of Westminster, states that the King and Council in the Parliament ofNorthampton had agreed that the Stone should be returned to Scotland, and ordersthe Abbot to hand it over to the Sheriffs of London for transmission to Isabella,the Queen-Mother. The second writ orders the Sheriffs to receive the Stonefrom the Abbot and to convey it to the Queen-Mother in whatever part of theNorth of England she may be. By this time the Queen-Mother had been entrusted with further negotiations with the Scots. In another document the Sheriffs, inreply to the King&apos;s writ, reported &quot;that the Abbot and Convent of Westminsterrefused to give up the Stone until they had treated of the matter with the King andhis Council.&quot; Two contemporary English chroniclers give different reasons for theStone not being sent. According to Baker&apos;s Chronicle, the Abbot wrote to the king and Council that, since King Edward I had carried off the Stone after great exertions(magnis laboribus abductus) and had devoutly offered it to his church, he was neither able nor in duty bound inon posset nec deberet) to allow it to be taken away. On the other hand, the Chronicle of Lanercost relates that Edward III&quot; restored to the Scots that piece of the Cross of Christ which the Scots call the black Rood. But the people of London would in nowise allow to be taken away from them the Stone of Scone whereon the Kings of Scotland used to be set at theircoronation at Scone.&quot; The Treaty of Northampton had caused much resentmentin England, where it was denounced as &quot; The Shameful Peace,&quot; and doubtless therewere demonstrations against it in London. The Stone was therefore not returned.In 1363 Edward III, as a result of his secret negotiations with David II, expectedto become King of Scotland, and promised in that event to bring the Stone with himso as to be crowned in Scone. His expectations were not realised and the Stoneremained in Westminster Abbey.The.Black Rood must have been returned to the Scots as they lost it at the battle of Neville&apos;s Cross (1346). v    ...... ,
There was a prophecy in Latin regarding the Stone which Sir Walter Scotttranslated thus        &apos;&quot; Unless the fates are faithless found,,       And prophefs voice be vain, ,Where&apos;er this monument is found-*j &apos; The Scottish race shall reign.&quot; -And he remarked:&quot; There were Scots who hailed the accomplishment of thisprophecy at the accession of James VI to the throne of England, and exulted,that in removing this palladium, the. policy of Edward resembled that which brought the Trojan horse in triumph within their walls, and which occasioned the destructionof their royal family.&quot;It may be added that the most recent discussion of the Treaty of Northamptonis by Dr. Stones, of the History Department, University of Glasgow, in &quot; an addition to the Rotuli Scotia,&quot; Scottish Historical Review, April 1950, pages 23-51.
