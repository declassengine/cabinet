The Class Z reservists are already being called up and both theTreasury, in relation to the Civil Service, and other public employers, suchas the Boards of the socialised industries, must take an immediate decision about their treatment.    In my view, whatever may be the decision on balance of civil pay in a future war or-indeed in peace-time hereafter, itis not practical pol itics to abandon it - or some treatment comparable with balance of civil pay - for those now being called up.    The working outof an alternative system of improved war service grants as outlined inC.P.(51) 99 cannot be undertaken at such short notice.    If therefore theCabinet decide against the balance of civil pay system for the long term,due notice will have to be given and reservists called up under the present arrangements will be the last to benefit by it.3. I attach a memorandum, which has been prepared in the treasury and agreed with the Service Departments and with the Ministry of Labour,which embodies my actual proposals for the Class Z reservists. Theseamount to:-(a) the granting of balance of civil pay for some 3,030reservistsbeing called up for three months and for some 6,000 reservistsbeing called up for eighteen months;(b) the granting to those called up for 15 days of a period of paidleave - the period being calculated on a basis broadly similarto, but rather less favourable than, that now used in calculating the number of daysr paid leave granted to volunteer membersof the Territorial Army.The second of these proposals is put forward because the administration -of balance of civil pay for short periods of call-up would be unduly compli-cated.    The broad effect is to give some of those called up for 15 days
H.G.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,13TH APRIL, 1951.. slightly.. Wtter -treatment thnn balance, of civil pay would give them andothers slightly worse.    It would only be materially more favourable inthe case of very highly paid staff, who will be very few.    I think there-fore that it can be accepted as doing rough and ready justice whileavoiding the complexities involved in any possible alternative,4.      ,    It is clear that the longer we continue to give balance of civilpay or anything like it the harder it will be to abandon the principle inthe future.    It would therefore be prudent to reach an early conclusion on the question of balance of civil pay on the long term.5. I therefore recommend that:-(a) The proposals set out in the attached memorandum andbriefly summarised above for the treatment of Class Zreservists should be endorsed.(b) A decision should be taken now on the question whether thebalance of civil pay system is to be approved for the     &apos;future, whether in war or in peace.
ANNEX213,BALANCE OF CIVIL PAYTREATMENT OF CLASS Z AND SIMILAR RESERVISTSThis paper sets out proposals for Clas s Z and similar reservistscalled up under the arrangements announced by the Prime Minister in his statement of 29th January, 1951.    It assumes that, whatever may be thedecision on balance of civil pay in a future war, it is not practical politicsto abandon it for some at least of the reservists now being called up,2. These arrangements are for the recall of:-(i)     some 235,000 Class Z reservists for 15 days&apos; training with theArmy and 10,000 Class G reservists for 15 days in the R.A.F.;(ii)     about 6,000naval reservists for 18 monthsf service;(iii)     (possibly) 200 regular and volunteer reservists for a similarperiod in the R.A.F.;(iv)    2,300 Royal Auxiliary Air Force reservists and 600 R.A.F.V.R.reservists for 3 months1 continuous training.Group (i) will be called the short-term group and (ii) - (iv) thelong-term group.3, The question is whether civil servants recalled under any of these schemes should continue to receive their civil pay in addition to militarypay, in whole or in part.4. There are three possibilities:-(i)     special leave without pay for everybody;(ii)     balance of civil pay for everybody;(iii)     some form of special leave with pay for the short-term group and balance of civil pay for the long-term group.5. Present Position(i)    All permanent staff and certain temporary staff are allowedspecial paid leave within defined limits if they are volunteer members ofthe Territorial Army, the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, etc. - (The amountof special leave varies between a maximum of 12 working days for staffwith an annual leave allowance not exceeding 18 days and up to 6 working days for staff with an annual leave allowance of 24 days or more.)(ii)     National Servicemen are entitled to special unpaid leave for theperiod of their annual training with the Territorial Army, etc.(iii)     Balance-of civil pay is in practice being given to most permanent staff who, as ex-Regulars or as members of the Regular Army Reserve ofOfficers, were recalled to the Colours following the outbreak of war in korea.   It is understood that it is not being given to some industrial staff.
(iv)    Balance of civil pay is not, however, being given:-(a) to any civil servant who may have volunteered forre-enlistment;(b) to temporary civil servants (unless they have beenemployed in the Service since before 3rd March, 1939);(c) to National Servicemen even if they volunteer to extend their period of service beyond 18 months.6. The arguments for and against treating the Z reservists in thevarious ways mentioned in paragraph 4 are considered below.7. Unpaid leave.    In private industry it will be left to individual employers to decide whether or not to make up, in whole or in part, the pay of their employees.    The Government will be expected to act as &quot;goodemployers&quot; in this matter, and, having regard to the present state ofpublic opinion, it seems inadvisable to recommend that all civil pay shouldbe withheld from the reservists,8. Balance of.civil pay for everybody.   This approach seems unsound,since the special administrative arrangements that would have to be intro-duced for paying balance of civil pay for periods as short as 15 days wouldbe exceedingly cumbersome in relation to the total sum involved.    Zreservists receive regular rates of Forces pay which will vary with rank and marital-status.    They also receive a bounty of  4 which it is intendedshall be tax-free and this would have to be grossed up for balance of civilpay purposes,9. Balance of civil pay for the long-term group and special leave ,with pay for the- short-term.    It seems sensible to give balance of civilpay to the long-term group, particularly as ex-Regular reservists called up following the crisis in Korea are receiving it, even though (a) the recallof the latter group is a consequence of an obligation voluntarily entered into and (b) they had been receiving a-retainer of Is, 6d per day in recognition oftheir obligation.    For the short-term group, what is needed is something that is rather better than the treatment given National Servicemen but not so good as that given to volunteer members of the Territorial Army,    The-former receive only unpaid special leave, the latter are treated as follows:-;Annual Leave Allowance18 days or lessMore than 18 days and lessthan 24 days24 days or moreSpecial Leave with PayThe whole training period up to a limit of 12 working days.Three out of four working days up to a limit of nine working days.One out of every two working days up toa limit of six days.Staff with an annual leave allowance of more than 18 days normally treat the rest of the training period as annual leave but special leave without pay is given on request.
10. Taking into account the  4 bounty for 15 days&apos; service and thefact that the service is compulsory, the following seems to be a reasonableallowance of special leave with pay for non-volunteer members of theTerritorial Army, etc. called up under the special 1951 arrangements:-Annual Leave Allowance Special Leave with Pay18 days or less 8 daysMore than 18 days and less 6 daysthan 24 days24 days or more 4 days the rest of the period will be treated as special leave without pay, unlessof course an officer prefers to take it out of his annual leave.11. These proposals maybe illustrated by two examples:  the figures are approximate.(i)     Take an unmarried postman,  whose Civil Service rate is 126s. Oda weekand annual leave allowance 14 days, and assume he isrecalled as a Private:-For a fortnight of Civil Service work he receives 252s, Od.For a fortnight as a Z reservists he receives 100s.0dx service pay plus 144s. Od.   Civil pay (i. e. pay for 8 days1 leave).Total:  244s. Qi.xFor a fortnight as a Territorial he receives 100s.   service pay plus 252s. Od. (i. e. full) Civil pay = 352s. Od.(ii)     Take a married Clerical Officer, whose Civil Service rate is 500 per annum = 190s.0d. a week and annual leave allowance24 days and assume he is recalled as a Corporal:-For a fortnight&apos;s Civil Service work he receives 380s..Od.xFor a fortnight as a Z reservist he receives 252s. Od.   service pay plus 108s. Od.  Civil pay (i. e, pay for 4 days&apos; leave).Total:  360s.0d.xFor a fortnight as a Territorial he receives 252s.   Service Payplus l64s.0d. Civil pay (i, e. pay for 6 days1 leave).   Total 416s. Od,12. It may seem as if these proposals err on the side of generositywhen regard is had to the bounty of  4 -which Z reservists are to receive(the Territorial figure is about  5 tax-free) but it is suggested that:-(i)     Public opinion is not likely to criticise a measure of generosity inall the circumstances.(ii)     The administrative advantage of this simple procedure as opposedto the complexity of balance of civil pay go a long way towardscompensating for the additional expenditure,(iii)     It is not practical politics to suggest a significantly lower scale of leave with pay without making the highest allowance(suggested 4 days) derisory.x   Exclusive of bounty in all cases.
10. Taking into account the  4 bounty for 15 days1 service and thefact that the service is compulsory, the following seems to be a reasonableallowance of special leave with pay for non-volunteer members of theTerritorial Army, etc. called up under the special 1951 arrangements :-Annual Leave Allowance Special Leave with Pay18 days or less 8 daysMore than 18 days and less 6 daysthan 24 days24 days or more 4 days the rest of the period will be treated as special leave without pay, unlessof course an officer prefers to take it out of his annual leave.11. These proposals may be illustrated by two examples:  the figures are aroroximate.(i)     Take an unmarried postman, whose Civil Service rate is 126s. Oda week and annual leave allowance 14 days, and assume he isrecalled as a Private:-For a fortnight of Civil Service workhe receives 252s.

13. These proposals have been discussed with the Service departments and with the Ministry of Labour.   All endorse the recommendations,though the War Office would like a rather more generous paid leaveallowance for the short-term reservists.14. The broad effect of these proposals is to give some of thosecalled up for 15 days better treatment than balance of civil pay or asystem of improved war service grants and others slightly worse.It is submitted that, since the great maj ority of staff will not bedifferently off from what they would be under balance of civil pay,the proposals can fairly be accepted as doing rough and ready justicewithout the complexities involved in possible alternatives.J
