THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTSPrinted for the Cabinet.  May 1951SECRET Copy No.CP. (51) 1288th May, 1951CABINETTHE EUROPEAN army memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues the following note onthe progress of the Paris Conference on the European Army since its opening inFebruary, and on United Kingdom policy towards the French proposals.2. Preliminary Foreign Office views on the French memorandum outlining theplan for a European Army were formulated in February.  These were, briefly-(a) that the French proposals made no attempt to reconcile the immediatemilitary necessities of North Atlantic Treaty defence and the long-termpolitical requirements of European federation; nor did they offer, except at a much later stage, the equality for Germany which had been claimed to be one of the main features of the Pleven Plan;(b) that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not wish to join a European Armyon the fines proposed, but that if Western Germany and the continental countries of N.A.T.O. could agree on a workable plan which would notimpede or delay N.A.T.O. defence, we should be content to let themproceed without interference on our part;(c) that in fact the Plan was so impractical as to be unlikely to succeed, exceptfor urgent political reasons.The conclusion was that there was no need to vary the instructions already given toSir O. Harvey, as His Majesty&apos;s Government^ representative at the Con-ference; namely, that he should attend merely as an observer and should interveneonly if the Plan showed signs of threatening our interests as an Occupying power in Germany or as a member of N.A.T.O.3.. The substance of these views was put to the Chiefs of Staff with a request for their opinion. They have now replied, without comment, that they agree withour conclusions.Attitude of Other Countries4. Before finally adopting these conclusions as the basis of our policy towardsthe European Army we should review, in the light of the progress of the paris conference in its first seven or eight weeks, what chances of success the Plan now seems to have and, in this connexion, the attitude of the other Powers mainly concerned.(a) FranceIt is difficult to distinguish any firm French governmental policy towards theEuropean Army. To some it may be a means of delaying German rearmament inany form, either indefinitely or at any rate until after the French elections; to othersit has a political appeal as a further move towards European federation. But theFrench delegation to the Conference has stated in terms that the aim of the plan is primarily political and it now seems clear that it is intended as a second stage(the Schuman Plan being the first) in the progressive association of Germany withthe West in such a way as to secure the advantages of her co-operation without the40572
disadvantages of a national independent Germany and in this particular casewithout bringing her into full.membership of the North Atlantic Treaty. If this istrue, it means that the French look on the European Army as part of a consideredlong-term policy and will do their best to make it succeed-even at the cost of concessions from the original draft such as they made in the course of negotiations on the Schuman Plan.(b) GermanyIt is, of course, on the German attitude that the European Army will stand orfall. The Federal Governmenfs first reaction was not unnaturally against the Plan,since it places Germany in a position of obvious inferiority: the proposed european defence Commissioner, for example, will for the first few years have much greaterpowers over German forces than over those of other contributing countries; thelatter will also maintain national contingents outside the European Army, whileGermany will not. But the German delegate to the Conference has repeatedlyexpressed his Governmenfs desire to participate in the European Army and theirsympathy with its political aims, and if they can secure such modifications of thePlan as to make it militarily effective they may decide to co-operate in the interestsof lasting reconciliation with France. Here too the principle of European unionlias a certain appeal.(c) United StatesOfficial American blessing for the Pleven Plan has been given in a letter fromMr. Acheson to M. Schuman, warmly welcoming the Conference on behalf of theUnited States Government and promising their assistance in making it a success.Although dated 27th January, this letter had been shown to the French in drafttwo months before and was in fact a quid pro quo for French acceptance of theNorth Atlantic CounciPs compromise plan for the creation of German units underN.A.T.O. In the past week the Americans have told M. Schuman that they arefollowing the progress of the Conference closely and with sympathy but that theydo not consider the French Plan to be sufficiently realistic and feel that agreement should be reached on an &quot; area of compromise &quot; which would allow national unitsof a workable size. (This is in fact very similar to our own approach, with thedifference that the Americans are not eligible for membership of the european army; we, on the other hand, are eligible but have chosen not to join.)Progress of the conference. The Conference has so far proceeded in rather desultory fashion, and theonly delegation other than the French to have played any appreciable part in it is theGerman. The crucial point so far as German participation is concerned is the level at which national units are to be integrated in the Army. The French Plan providedthat the largest single unit of one nationality should be the Combat Team (5,000-6,000 men). The Germans argue, as they have at the technical talks in Bonn withrepresentatives of the Allied High Commission, that an &quot; unite operative,&quot; made upof two Combat Teams of the same nationality, is the smallest practicable fightingunit. Two or three &quot;unites operatives&quot; of different nationalities could then be linked together as a major formation. (The Combat Team was accepted by theN.A.T.O. Powers for purposes of the German defence contribution on Frenchinsistence. It was a purely political decision, and the views of the British and american Chiefs of Staff remain that the Division is the optimum unit.) TheGerman case has been argued at the Conference with great persuasion and the conversation between M. Schuman and Mr. Acheson referred to above brought out the interesting point that the French are seriously considering the german counter proposal, which has the advantage of avoiding the actual word &quot; division.&quot;6.. The political, as opposed to the military, features of the European Armyhave so far been only briefly discussed in Paris; they are modelled closely on the schuman Plan, and the Court of Justice and possibly the Assembly are to be thesame for both organisations. There is no reason to suppose that the participating countries, all of whom are members of the Schuman Plan, will have any objection ofprinciple to this part of the scheme.7. Broadly speaking, therefore, the Paris Conference begins to look as if itmight result in an agreement. It is true that the French look on the european army primarily as a long-term political device, whereas the Germans, while recog-recognising its political importance, are primarily concerned that it should make sense

If, for example, the French did in fact concede that nationalunits should be at Divisional (i.e., &quot; unite operative &quot;) instead of Combat Teamlevel, the Germans might forgo, for the purposes of the European Army, thecomplete political equality which they have so far made a condition of their partici-pation in any Western defence.Bonn Discussions8. The European Army must be viewed in the light of our policy for german rearmament as a whole, and of the parallel talks in Germany between the federal government and the Occupying Powers. When these talks were authorised by theNorth Atlantic Council in December, their object was &quot; to secure the earliest possiblerecruitment and training of German formations for the integrated defence force.&quot;And in noting the French Governmenfs intention of calling a Conference to discussthe European Army, the Council expressed doubt whether the latter could be developed quickly enough to meet the immediate military need. Since that time,however, it has become evident that for various reasons, including the process of.modifying the occupation regime and the probability that the necessary equipment for German units will not be available during the next two years, German rearmament -ment cannot be rushed through. The United Kingdom High Commissioner has accordingly been instructed to concentrate attention on the development of a contractual relationship with the Federal Government rather than on the militarydiscussions. One of our original objections to the European Army, namely that itwould inevitably delay the creation of German units, is therefore less valid now.9. On the whole, the Americans do not seem to share our views on the timing of the German contribution, although General Eisenhower has expressed very similar ones. Nevertheless, in view both of the evident relaxation of Britishpressure and of the rapidly increasing military strength of the Western Powers, theFrench Government might be tempted to argue that the Brussels decisions werepremature and to drag out the European Army Conference as a means of indefinitelypostponing German rearmament. Alternatively they may decide, whatever thefinal Allied decision on timing, to press on with the European Army so as to havethe desired framework firmly established for such time as German units are finallyraised.   This is perhaps the more likely alternative.10. The Germans are of course in a strong position to play off the two sets of negotiations against one another. They have not yet taken advantage of this, butthe possibility cannot be overlooked that they may do so, particularly if we now seekfor our part to drag out the Bonn discussions.Conclusions11. (a) The European Army Conference still has a long way to go, particularlyin the vital question of relations between the Army and N.A.T.O. There have been only five plenary sessions and a few meetings of sub-committees, all of them devotedto preliminary exchanges of view in which three of the five contributing countries have taken very little part. No Government.seems to be in any hurry. comments on the possible outcome of the Conference can therefore only be very tentative; withthis reservation the chances seem to be that &apos; (i) the political structure will be retained in something like its present form;(ii) German realism will succeed in modifying the more impracticable features of the military part;(iii) an agreement of some sort will be reached.(b) There seems no reason yet for His Majesty&apos;s Government to reconsider their decision not to join the European Army and to attend the Conference only as an observer. Nevertheless, if the original proposals undergo as much modification asdid the draft Schuman Plan, it would still be open to us to join it at a later stage.H. M.
