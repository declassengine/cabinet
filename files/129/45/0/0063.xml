(51) 13824th May, 1951CABINETUNITED NATIONS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL council report on the Twelfth session memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs submit, for the information of my colleagues, the following report on the twelfth Session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, which washeld at Santiago de Chile from 20th February to 21st March, 1951.2. The Twelfth Session of the Economic and Social Council was the first to be held away from New York or Geneva. It was mainly notable for the virulenceof the propaganda attacks directed by the Slav delegates against the western powers, and for the urgency with which the representatives of the under-developed countries advanced their demands that rearmament should not affect the supply offinance and capital goods for their economic development. The following para-graphs briefly describe the principal debates:  Economic items. The main business of the session was the annual debate on the world economic situation, with which were linked discussions of the annual reports of theInternational Monetary Fund and of the International Bank and of methods of financing the economic development of the under-developed countries. The three major themes of these debates were:(i) The argument of the under-developed countries that rearmament shouldnot be allowed to interrupt the flow of capital and equipment requiredfor economic development, and that if commodity prices were to be controlled then the prices of industrial products must also be controlled;(ii) the &quot; peace offensive&quot; propaganda of the Slav delegates, who drew attention to the reductions in the standard of living of the workerswhich would result from rearmament and called for wholesale cuts in defence programmes; and(iii) the call of the more industrial countries, who laid the blame forrearmament at the door of the Cominform countries, for increased production of raw materials.4. At the end of the debate a resolution was adopted which called on all governments to take measures to ensure adequate production and equitable distribution of capital goods, essential consumer goods and raw materials, themaintenance of &quot; equitable price relationships &quot; between goods moving in inter-national trade, and the avoidance of inflationary pressures. Member governments were requested to submit a report to the next meeting of the Council on the stepsthey had taken in this connexion.Forced Labour5. The Council had before it a resolution presented jointly by the UnitedStates and United Kingdom Delegations at its previous session which called for theestablishment of a small committee of experts to take evidence about the nature40627
and scale of forced labour in existence to-day. The Slav delegations attempted to confuse the issue by bitter attacks on working conditions in the United States,Colonial territories and Latin America, and reintroduced a resolution previouslyrejected by the Council, which was couched in propaganda terms and called forthe establishment of a Trades Union Commission of Enquiry whose membership would have been weighted in their favour. The Soviet delegate, however, failed once again to answer a direct question whether even such a commission would beallowed into the Soviet Union. The violence of the Slav speeches probably contri-buted to the final result whereby the joint United States-United Kingdom draft resolution was adopted with the support of all the members of the Council apartfrom the Soviet bloc.Trades Union Rights6. Another debate which should have been purely procedural but which wasturned by the Slav delegates into a full-scale propaganda discussion was that on certain allegations of infringement of Trades Union rights which had been addressedto the United Nations by Trade Union organisations. Eventually a resolution wasadopted transmitting to the International Labour Organisation for its consideration in accordance with the agreed procedure allegations directed against certain ofits members and asking the Soviet Government and the Governments of roumania and Spain to state whether they would agree to the transmission to the InternationalLabour Organisation, for consideration by its Fact-Finding and ConciliationCommission, of allegations directed against them.Procedural items. The Council adopted a resolution declaring that it had no objection to the admission of the German Federal Republic, Japan, Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodiato the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. TheSoviet bloc voted against all these applications, and the Philippines against that of japan. A resolution was also adopted inviting the German Federal Governmentto accede to the United Nations Road Traffic Convention.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,24th May, 1951.

DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;  GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(51) 13924TH MAY, 1951COPY NO.CABINETGERMAN DEBT settlement memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues,the text of a communication and enclosures regarding arrangements lor arriving at aGerman debt settlement (Appendix A).    In agreement with the United Statesand French Governments, it is proposed to issue these documents in thenear future to interested Governments and other parties, and subsequently to the Press.2. The documents themselves are largely self-explanatory.    I might, however, recall that the three Foreign Ministers agreed in New Yorkin September, 1950 (C.P.(50) 222 of 6th October, 1950, paragraph 6), thatundertakings regarding liability for the pre-war Reich debt and the debtsarising out of economic assistance furnished to Germany by the three powers since the war should be obtained from the German Federal Govern-ment;  and that the Inter-Governmental Study Group on Germany should prepare a plan for handling outstanding claims against Germany in accord-ance with an agreed statement of principle.    The statement of principleprovided inter alia:-(i)     that if a settlement plan were worked out and agreed procedures and controls established to govern it, the three governments would agree to modify the priority of their claims in respect of post-war economic assistance to the extent necessary to permit the fulfilment of such an agreed plan;(ii)     that the plan should provide for the settlement both of pre-war external public and private debts of all types and of claims for post-war economic assistance;(iii)     that claims relating to war damage to United Nations property inGermany and to expenditure on external occupation costs shouldnot be included in the plan.3. The undertaking from the Federal Republic was obtained by an exchange of letters of the 6th March (Enclosure 1 of Appendix A) as mentioned in CP.(51) 74 of 9th March, 1951, paragraph 3.    The work in thepreparation of a settlement plan has now reached a point at which it seems desirable to enter into a series of consultations with interested parties;and I have agreed after consultation with the Chancellor of the exchequer that a special body, to be known as the Tripartite Commission on GermanDebts, should be set up in order to represent the interests of the three governments in these consultations and in the ensuing negotiations.
