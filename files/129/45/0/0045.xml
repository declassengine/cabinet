The reasons that have led me to these conclusions are as follows:  In 1296 King Edward I became the owner of the Stone by right of capture.There is no evidence that The King or his successors ever relinquished that ownership.Although the stone was physically lodged in Westminster Abbey, it was, as far aswe know, never given to the Abbey or dedicated to the service of religion. In thewrit of 1328 the King refers to the Stone merely as being in the Abbot&apos;s &quot; custody &quot;(&quot; en votre garde &quot;). Effluxion of time will not alter the nature of The King&apos;s title;the Stone remains to this day vested in The King.3. It may fairly be argued that the history of the Stone in the reign ofEdward III shows that The King?s ownership was not treated as a personal one,but that the Stone was considered to belong to him as the head and embodimentof the English nation. This proposition is supported by the fact.that the writsof 1328 owed their origin to the proceedings in the Parliament of Northampton.4. It must be observed that the operative part of the writ of 1st July, 1328, wasthat the Stone should be handed over to Isabella in the north of England. It seemsobvious that it was anticipated that she would negotiate with the Scots about itsreturn, and these negotiations proved abortive. It is not the fact that the operativepart of the order transferred the Stone to the Scots.5. The Historiographer-Royal for Scotland assumes that an obligation toreturn the Stone arises from the terms of the Treaty of Northampton of 1328. Ihave some doubt whether the relevant provision really bears out such a construc-tion. The section refers to &quot; records, bonds, instruments and other munimentsrelating to the subjugation of the people or country of Scotland and all other instruments and privileges touching upon the liberty of Scotland.&quot; It seems difficultto me to assume that the Stone would fall under any of these heads.6. If the rights be considered on the somewhat fanciful basis of a dispute between The King in right of the Crown of England and The King in right of theCrown of Scotland, there is a further consideration which must be borne in mind.40527
When the Act of Union was passed in 1706 it conferred legal authority upon theArticles of Agreement which had been made between the Scots and the English.Article J!4 of the Articles makes no reference whatever to the S tone, t although, -itdoes malce specific provisions with regard to such matters as^e^^ecbrds.iandregalia. It provides, in particular, that the Grown, Sceptre and Sword pfx Stateand records of Parliament shall continue to be kept in Scotland and snail so femahlin all time coming notwithstanding the Union. These Articles vslexel supposedvtbbe a complete settlement of all disputes outstanding between England and Scotland,and I find it quite inconceivable that the Stone would not have been dealt with if ithad been intended to transfer it to Scotland.J-Lord Chancellors Office,House of Lords, S.W. 1,30th April, 1951.
