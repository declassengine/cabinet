P3 HIS.DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJ-EST &apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET3UCP. (51) 124 COPY NO. I I21ST MAY, 1951CABINETMANCHESTER DOCK STRIKE;   UNLOADINGOF RAW MATERIALSMemorandum by the Home SecretaryFor the past four weeks the Manchester dockers have been onunofficial strike over a question of discipline.   The National Docks Officerof the Transport and General Workers Union has made efforts to persuade the men to return, so far without success.   At a meeting called by the unofficial Strike Committee yesterday it was decided to stay out for afurther week.   The Ministry of Labour have been following the course of thestrike but have so far not intervened in order not to weaken the authority ofthe Union.2. At present there are some 37 ocean-going ships held up inManchester Docks waiting to be unloaded.   Some of them contain rawmaterials of strategic importance to this country, including cotton, copper,zinc, sulphur and carbon black.   No steps have so far been taken by the Govern-ment to unload these ships or to have them transferred to other ports, partly because such action might spread the strike:  but mainly because, in theview of the departments concerned, the delay in unloading was having no serious effect on production, fed as it is from working stocks already available.3. Last week Sir Ralph Glyn, M. P. , conveyed privately to the Ministerof Defence some information given him by the United States Embassy aboutcertain vessels in American ownership which were, or might become,involved.   The details are given in the Annex to this memorandum.   It will beseen that one vessel, the  &apos;CHARLES LYXES&apos;1, is now held up in Manchester,and that another, the &quot;JOHN LYKES&quot;, having failed to get copper1 and carbonblack unloaded at Manchester, took her cargo to Belfast where it was unloadedand awaits shipment back to England.4. The situation was today considered by the Ministerial Committee on emergencies,   Discussion centred mainly on the &quot;CHARLES LYKES11 and theother vessels belonging to the same owners.   As will be seen from the Annex,the owners are becoming restive at the delay imposed by the strike and, inorder to free the &quot;CHARLES LYKES&quot; for further work, would like to removeher from Manchester for unloading elsewhere.   They have mentioned thepossibility of taking the cargo back to the United States but this is probably not to be taken seriously.   It seems more likely that, left to themselves, theowners would send the 1 CHARLES LYKES&quot; to Antwerp for unloading.   Becausecontinuing delay in unloading in this country or diversion to Antwerp would nothave any immediate effect on production, the Minister of Supply has nodepartmental reasons for objecting to any action which the owners might take.Further there is no danger of the cargoes being ultimately lost to this country.He shares, however, the general feeling of the Committee that there might be /embarrassing political repercussions, both in this country and in the UnitedStates, if it became widely known that strategic raw materials shipped to thiscountry from the United States were either not being unloaded or were being diverted (however temporarily) to a foreign port.   Moreover, failure to secure&apos;quick turn-round of ships is bad in itself.
5. It seemed to me and to several members of the Committee that inorder to meet these political considerations there was need for some positivedemonstration of the Governments desire to overcome the difficulties imposed by the Manchester dock strike.   Unloading at Manchester by military labour would be undesirable, as also would be diverting the ship  to anothercommercial port in this country.   The only possibilities therefore seem to beto attempt to persuade the owners (they cannot be compelled) to transfer theship either to Belfast or to Cairnryan, a military port on the west coast ofScotland, where she could be discharged by military labour.6. The detailed considerations affecting the choice between these two alternatives are as follows:-Belfast -  Unlike many ports, Belfast has the special facilities required for unloading carbon black.   When the &quot;JOHN LYKES&quot; wasunloaded there, there was no sign of objection by the dockers:  it isnot possible to say how they would react if another ship were sentthere.   The port authorities, when approached by the owners somedays ago, were reluctant to accept the &quot;CHARLES LYKES&quot; on theground that the docks were already congested,Cairnryan -  There would be no labour trouble at this port, thoughthe transference of the ship there might cause labour trouble at other commercial ports.   Unloading could take place only at the rateof 500 tons a day, and would have to be direct into railway trucks oroverside into coasters.   Moreover, there are other shipsaffected by the strike and, if the &quot;CHARLES LYKES&quot; were diverted to Cairnryan, there might well arise a demand for the Governmentto take action to unload other ships, particularly if they were ladenwith foodstuffs or raw materials for the rearmament programme.7. Although the Ministerial Committee on Emergencies were generally in agreement with the view that some positive action was necessary, I did not find sufficient unanimity of view about either of the possible alternatives.   Inthese circumstances, I felt that the only course open to me was, afterascertaining certain further facts, to submit the matter to the Cabinet.I therefore ask my colleagues -(a) to decide whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should attempt to influence the owners of the &quot;CHARLES LYKES&quot; against divertingthat vessel to Antwerp;  and if so,(b) whether the &quot;CHARLES LYKES&quot; should be diverted to Belfast or toCairnryan.J. C. E.Home Office, S. W. 1.,21ST MAY, 1951.
ANNEXNotes on certain ships in United States ownershipaffected by the Manchester Dock strike the &quot;JOHN LYKES&quot;, carrying 1,200 tons copper, 140 tons carbonblack, waited over a fortnight at Manchester, then was forcedto sail to Belfast where the cargo was discharged, but so far it hasnot been lifted back to any United Kingdom port.The &quot;CHARLES LYKES&quot; (8,000 tons) has been held up in Manchesterwaiting to unload for nearly two weeks.   Her cargo contains,amongst other things, 2,100 tons of carbon black, 1,000 tons ofzinc, and 2,003 tons of other urgent metals.  (It is understood thatthis is mainly copper).   She is still waiting to unload.The owners have spoken of sailing the ship back to the UnitedStates or to Antwerp, and discharging the cargo there.The &quot;TYSON LYKES&quot;, due to arrive in Manchester during thecourse of this week or next, has on board 2,900 tons of copper,400 tons of carbon black, 2,100 tons of cotton, 347 tons of zinc,besides 440 tons of beef and 286 tons of lard.   The owners saythat, if no better facilities are made available at Manchester, thiscargo must be diverted to Antwerp.The &quot;STELLA LYKES&quot;, now in Scandinavian waters, due to arriveat Liverpool, there to load 2,500 tons of export material for a strategic plant in the Gulf.   (The material is understood toinclude oil pipes).   The owners say this vessel will have to be diverted from this cargo owing to the dislocation of services dueto the refusal of dockers at Manchester to handle the above cargoes.
