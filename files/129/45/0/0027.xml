THIS  DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  April 1951CONFIDENTIALCP. (51) 1029th April, 1951CABINETPROPAGANDA FILM OF THE BERLIN YOUTH RALLYMemorandum by the Home secretary i desire to draw the attention of my colleagues to certain points arising on theForeign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum on the subject of the propaganda film of the berlin Youth Rally (CP. (51) 86).2. As I understand it, the main question is whether the President of the Boardof Trade should refuse to grant an import licence for a copy of this film on theapplication of the National Union of Students, but paragraph 6 of the foreign secretary^ Memorandum refers to the possibility of exercising the royal prerogative to detain the film at the port of entry and to prevent the film being released to the National Union of Students. The circumstances in which it wouldin my view be proper to exercise the Prerogative powers are summarised in para-graph 6 of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum. I have seen an exhibition of the film and in my view there can be no question of using the Prerogative power to intercept it. The use of the power is open to challenge both in the courts and inParliament and there is grave danger of losing this power or of having it curtailedif it is used unnecessarily,3. It should be made clear that if the film is, in fact, brought into this countrythere is nothing the Government can do to prevent it being exhibited. Privateexhibitions of the film would be subject to no control, and in the case of publicexhibitions the control would rest with the local licensing authority. It would be quite contrary to accepted practice and most undesirable for the Government toattempt to interfere with the discretion which the law has vested in local licensing authorities.4. While anything that may be said on the question of merits must be subjectto review when information as to the nature of the import licensing powers is avail-able, it does seem to me that it would be quite wrong in principle to use such powersto exercise censorship. I see that in paragraph 7 of the Foreign Secretary?sMemorandum it is suggested that we should have prevented the importation of Nazianti-semitic propaganda films before the war, but I am not aware that any questionof such action ever arose. If we attempt to exercise the powers to regulate importfor the purpose of imposing a political censorship, we shall without doubt find ourselves in very deep water before long. I should have thought that action by theGovernment to prevent the importation of this film would provide much betterpropaganda material for the Communists than the film itself is likely to do.J.
