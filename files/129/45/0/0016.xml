(51) 82].2. I have never attached great practical importance to the proposed convention on Human Rights and do not myself think (as some do) that its existencewould afford in itself an effective statement and standard of the rights of manwhich would act as a kind of barrier against the encroachment of totalitarianrestrictions. But I do not think we should ignore the advantage to be gained by having the representatives of different countries constantly engaged in the attemptto embody in formal principles the rules of conduct to which, ideally, States should conform. It is not so much individual results which are important as the collectivewill to achieve them. However this may be, it cannot be doubted that the proposed convention is regarded as an important weapon in the ideological war. We should certainly not escape from its use against us by the device of withdrawing from thediscussion of its terms. I should have thought that, on the contrary, any withdrawal by us at this stage would be regarded by most countries as a retrograde change ofpolicy in a matter in which we had hitherto taken a leading part and wouldbe seized upon by the Communists as an indication of our &quot; anti-democratic,&quot;&quot; imperialist&quot; and &quot; fascist&quot; tendencies. However unjustified these accusations,we should not allow ourselves to be put on the defensive in regard to them andshould hesitate to provide any material which might give them even a semblanceof truth. Moreover, our own abstention at this stage will probably only result inthe eventual draft Convention being even more objectionable than are the present proposals.3. It is true that many of the clauses now under discussion are unacceptable tous domestically. It does not follow that by continuing to discuss the matter now and seeking to guide the General Assembly into the adoption of less objectionableprovisions we should bind ourselves to the eventual acceptance of stipulationswhich we could not reconcile with our Colonial and other responsibilities.4. It seems to me, however, that some of the drafting objections are more theo-retical than real. No other country engages, nor need we, in any over nice andmeticulous comparison of its own municipal laws against its treaty obligations inorder to make sure that no possible discrepancy exists. In fact, some discrepanciesare inevitable and can almost always be found when State laws are subjected to a minute examination side by side with some international document drafted by thetroublesome process of reconciling points of view based on very differing legalsystems. The most that can be sought in connection with such political manifestosas in effect are constituted by these Conventions on Human Rights, is that in substance and principle, if not in every detail, our practice protects the rights laiddown.5. President Truman indicated the significance which he attached to the pre-liminary Declaration of Human Rights (and not only by the non-symbolical act of burying it under the foundation stone of the new United Nations Headquarters!)40337
and other important c&amp;tfritries,&apos;;w&amp;^ some in theCommonwealth, are I understand still in favour of attempting to secure a Conven-tibn. &quot;Thope that we also&apos; will&quot;&quot;continue m &quot;these erideavoursV If at the end of the dayno Convention is adopted we shall not be the sole objects of blame for the fact.Ahdlfeorlthe other hand the Convention eventually concluded-ej^taiMSiclau.$ejsptowhich we cannot subscribe we can either make reservations or decline to- ratify?No doubt many others (including some of those now showing such enthusiasm) willnot, in the end, ratify and we will find ourselves in at least a. more riumefouscompany if at some indefinite future date, which may indeed be long^ostpoAM^erefused to ratify than if we Withdraw altogether at this stage. We ought not toallow ourselves to be found in the company, of. the less progressive States in refusing to go further with the matter. J 16.  The Solicitor-General has asked me to say that he agrees with these views.zmom vtamuh      tfon-tf;iYi*o-j :khoitah oaxl^iw. S.Royal Courts of justice, W.C. 2,Tlth March, 1951. \,vm- rrwmvi
