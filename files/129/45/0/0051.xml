THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY  OF mS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENT\. it &apos;z Kt.&apos;l.S &quot;if *x . V..&apos;.. 7.:&apos;        ..4Vw,..t . v.-..&apos;..!..RET ATX FOOD prices memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExcHEQi^Ri^NDrlyliNis^ERSOF Foo^At their meeting on 19th March the Cabinet asked&apos; u^jraithe light of. :their:;discussions, to review the proposed increases.in retail food,prices, and,in,particular to&apos; consider whether there should nOt be a greater mcre&quot;allf&apos;(njthf &apos;pr i^ pf ,:rneat;instead of a second increase of Ad. in the price- &quot;of,, tea&apos; .(CJ^ISfj^lst^i^ii^^.Minute 3).i 2.; On further consideration, we did not feel able toijrecomniend :an increaseinthemeat price beyond 3d.: a lb. for the following reasonsnoi, -gtilhmi m&apos;io otiiumA further increase of Id. a lb., giving an estimated saving of  13-6 mnlion in.*1951-52, would change an over-all subsidy on meat into an estimated profit. Thiswould be undesirable, especially in view of the heavy continuing subsidy on bacon.Moreover, an increase of 3d. a lb. does not cover the full extra cost which consumerswill have to bear: the further premium of 2d. a lb. on chilled meat to reflect thequality differential over frozen meat is likely also to be regardeoUfay thevpublic asa price increase.3. For administrative reasons it would have been necessary to announce the increases for sugar and fats on or before 25th April if these increases were to be effective from 20th May. The announcement of these increases close togetherwould, in our view, have been disadvantageous. We decided, therefore, to postpone the introduction of the sugar increase until 15th July, the beginning of the nexteight-week ration period. The announcement of this increase will therefore be made some time in June. We arranged to announce the increase for fats on 25th April, as previously envisaged. The milk increase will be announced some time in June, totake effect from 1st July.4. At the Cabinet meeting on 19th March it was assumed that the meatincrease would be announced as part of the announcement of an agreement with argentina and that it would be put into effect as soon as practicable after the dateof announcement. At the meeting on 9th April, however, it was agreed that thepossibility should be explored of linking the price increase with an increase in the ration (CM. (51) 25th Conclusions, Minute 1). We decided that the opportunity(which the sudden conclusion of an agreement with the Argentine provided) forlinking the higher retail price with the higher prices paid to the Argentine must notbe missed, but that we could still make the introduction of the higher retail pricescoincide with an increase in the ration. Accordingly, in announcing the agreementwith the Argentine, the Minister of Food said that the higher prices payable tothe Argentine, taken together with the higher prices payable to home farmers, wouldmean increasing retail meat prices by an average of 3d. a ib. and that details wouldbe announced later. This announcement was in general enough terms to leave open the date at which the higher retail prices will be introduced. This will be decided by the Minister of Food in the light of the supply position as it develops, with theintention of linking the effective announcement of higher prices with the announce-ment of an increased ration.40565
5. The pattern of increases which we have now agreed is, therefore, as set out below. It differs from&apos; that submitted in CP. (51): 79 lri only one respect-theinclusion of Id. a quart on milk for seven months in place of the second increaseof Ad. a lb. in the price of tea:-Estimated SubsidySaving in 1951-52 ISS(  million) -7 - 9  Announced on 14th fviarchAnnounced on 31st March2267  Not yet announced3   Announced in general terms24th AprilNot yet announcedTea    ...Bread ...Flour ...ButterMargarineCooking FatSugar ...Meat ...Milk  ...4d.Id.id.6d..4d.4d.Id.a lb.on 3 lb. loafa lb.a lb.a lb.a lb.a lb.(domestic user)Average of 3d. a lbId. a quart for seven months95-17-12-5-6-37-9-6Announced on 26th April11106. The savings originally anticipated from the sugar and meat price increases have now been adjusted to take account of the new dates when they are to become effective and, inthecase of meat, of a revised estimate of the probable savings.7. The total estimated saving of  ill million in 1951-52 is about  5 million less than &quot;the estimated Budget saving required with a subsidy Ceiling of 410 million. It may therefore be necessary on this limited count to make furtherprice increases later in the year, but the position will have to be kept underreview in the light of the prices which the Ministry of Food has to pay in the generalcourse of its trading activities, and of the level of distribution for all food throughoutthe year. u -- - :.- ?m ;.&apos;..   . .
