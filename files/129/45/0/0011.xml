THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. March 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.CP. (51) 86   ,19th March, 1951 -CABINETPROPAGANDA FILM OF THE BERLIN YOUTH RALLYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe problem the Free German Youth (F.D.J.) held a mass rally in Berlin last Whitsunpreceded by an International Congress of the Young Fighters for Peace. Animpressive coloured film of this Rally was made for propaganda purposes.2. A copy Of this film has been imported for exhibitidn to student audiencesin the United Kingdom. A decision must be given on whether or hot an importlicence for this film will be granted.3. At the same time a decision1 must be taken as to whether or riot the wholeor part of the film will be exhibited to selected audiences in the United Kingdom.Background4. The Free German Youth Rally in Berlin last Whitsun was a demonstration of the strength and organisation of the Communist youth movement of the EasternZone of Germany. Some 700,000 youth took part, mostly from the Eastern Zone,and the cost of holding the Rally is reported to have been about  2 million. Severalcontingents from Western Germany also participated and there were guests fromother countries, mostly from the Satellites. The slogans of the Rally were&quot; Prepared to Fight for Peace &quot; and &quot; Friendship.&quot; A very powerful coloured filmof the Rally under the title &quot; Immer Bereit&quot; (Always Prepared) was made for propaganda purposes. A copy of this film was seized in the raid on Communistheadquarters in Dusseldorf last autumn and has been shown to selected audiencesin Western Germany and to Members of Parliament and to official audiences inLondon. Some of my colleagues may remember seeing it.5. A copy of this film was made available by Honnecker, the leader of theFree German Youth, to the delegate of the National Union of Students, whoattended the recent meeting of the International Union of Students in Berlin. Thisdelegate has announced the intention of exhibiting it to the N.U.S. Council and groups of students in the United Kingdom in order to show them the unmistakablepolitical atmosphere of Communist-sponsored Youth Rallies, and in order thatthey may thereby determine their attitude towards any further Rallies which maybe held by the International Union of Students in Berlin. At the request of theForeign Office the Board of Trade have held up the application for an import licence for this film which has been made on behalf of the National Union of Students.6. I have also consulted the Secretary of State for the Home Departmentregarding the possibility of exercising the Royal Prerogative in order to prevent the film being released to the National Union of Students. He points out that it isHome Office policy to use the power of Prerogative very sparingly, and to interceptincoming publications (which include films) only if they advocate or approvebreaches of the law, or where, without going so far, the whole tendency is toencourage the commission of offences, or where they present a serious and urgentthreat to the safety of the State. In this case he is reluctant to exercise his powerto intercept the film.40308
7. The refusal of an import licence would no doubt lay His Majesty&apos;s Govefn-ment open to accusations of interfering: with the liberty of the subject and withfreedom of thought and publication. On the other hand. His Majesty&apos;s government might well also be criticised for allowing a foreign publication of such a dangerouspropaganda nature to enter this country and be shown to immature persons whohave not the political wisdom to see through it. I do not see why we should allowthis film to be imported any more than we would have allowed Nazi anti-semiticpropaganda films before the war. Nevertheless, since this may raise: matters ofimportance from the point of internal politics, I would welcome my colleagues&apos;views on whether the public interest would be better served by letting the filmthrough or refusing an import licence.8. This film was seen in Germany by, among others, the Director of education of the County Borough of Sunderland, who asked that the film be shown at the youth Service Conference at Ashridge from 22nd to 30th April, 1951. He also suggested that, with the exercise of due care, it should be generally released in thiscountry. The Bristol University Institute of Education had also heard of the filmand requested a showing at their Conference on Youth problems on 2nd January.As the film was then in Germany the request could not be granted. Other bodiesmight, however, hear of it and ask for a showing. A decision must therefore betaken on the general question of exhibition of the film in this country.recommendation . I do not think we should show the full coloured version in its original form.I see no reason, however, why extracts from it, suitably edited and drawing parallelswith similar films of the Nazi Youth Movement, should not be shown to bring)V&apos;ome to the British people the danger of the Communist regimentation of the youthunder their care.10.   I would be grateful for the views of my colleagues on this point.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,\9th March, 1951.
