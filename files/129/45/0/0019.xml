S^w ,jit:Jwk^ s &quot;-:o:^bv/CABINETPOLITICAL PROBLEMS OF THE MIDDLE east memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AfeairsFor the purptose of this paper the Middle East is defined as comprising Persia,Turkey, the Arab States (Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, the Lebanon, Saudi arabia and the Yemen), Israel, and the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms.2.   The political problems of the area can be divided into three categories:  A-Internal problems in the States concerned.B. Problems affecting relations between States of the area.C. Problems affecting relations between these States and other foreign Powers(principally the United Kingdom).Internal Problems3. Turkey is homogeneous and comparatively stable and prosperous, andpresents no serious internal problems.4. Israel is- comparatively stable politically, but has grave economic troubleswhich, in default of great and continuing external aid, might bring- about collapse.5. The Arab States, while at differing stages of development, are all organisedmore or less on feudal lines, and power remains in the hands of a limited rulingclass who are for the most part reactionary and corrupt, but to whom there is as yet no visible alternative, which is a pity and will require discrete attention. Thesecountries are all politically immature, and parliamentary democracy, where it hasbeen established, works most imperfectly; and the general standard of adminis-tration is low. The irresponsibility and personal rivalries of the ruling classes resultin perpetual political instability; but the populations are predominantly agricultural,with little or no industrial proletariat, and their standard of living, though low, isnot such as to breed serious discontent. Communism, to Which Islam is hostile, hasconsequently made little headway amongst them; but conditions favourable to itsexpansion clearly exist.6. In Jordan, Syria, the Lebanon, and the Egyptian-administered &quot; Gazastrip,&quot; the presence of nearly 900,000 homeless and destitute Arab refugees from palestine constitutes a grave humanitarian and political problem which bears par-ticularly hardly on the economy of Jordan and has so far defied the efforts of theUnited Nations to solve it.7. Persia, though different in race and language from the Arab States, suffersfrom similar political troubles, aggravated by the existence of a substantial Com-munist-dominated party (the Tudeh Party), whose&quot; influence is favoured by badadministration and Unsatisfactory economic Conditions. The personal loyaltywhich the Shah inspires, and the traditional Persian suspicion of Russia, are counter-factors.Inter-State Problems8. Arab-hraet Situation. No peace settlement between Israel and the arab states is in sight. The Armistice Agreements between Israel and her Arab neigh-bours, supervised by a United Nations Commission, work reasonably welU despite40349
periodical frontier incidents, particularly between Israel and Jordan. Israelundoubtedly desires a peace settlement, in order to enable her to demobilise andpursue her economic development. The Arab States do not; Arab hostility to Israel is unrelenting, and the Arab League last year passed a resolution providingfor the expulsion of any of its members which made peace with Israel without theLeagued consent. - The Arabs also fear Israeli economic penetration, and,-whilerealising that they could not successfully attack Israel, imagine that the blockade towhich they are subjecting her is more effective than is actually the case and will eventually produce her downfall. King Abdullah of Jordan, more far-sighted thanmost Arabs, would welcome a settlement, which would bring Jordan substantialeconomic advantages, but no Jordan statesman will follow him for fear of counter-action by the League. Consequently, while recent private Jordan-Israel talks havemade some progress, they are unlikely to produce more than a limited ad hocsolution of certain difficulties between them.9. The Tripartite statement issued by the United Kingdom, United States andFrench Governments in May 1950 in effect constitutes a guarantee to both israel and the Arab States against aggression by the other. Israel believes in it; the arab states less so, because they fear that Jewish influence in the United States and united Kingdom might prevent its implementation if Israel were to commitaggression. Jordan, however, believes in the additional guarantee provided by theAnglo-Jordan Treaty of Alliance.10. The.present unstable equilibrium between Israel and the Arab States maywell continue indefinitely.   Its main disadvantages are:  (a) The difficulty, in present circumstances, of fitting both Israel and the arab states into a comprehensive plan of Middle East defence, and(b) Certain practical difficulties, such as the closing of the Iraq pipe-line toHaifa and the Egyptian ban on the passage of &quot;contraband&quot; goodsdestined for Israel through the Suez Canal.11. Inter-Arab Friction. Whilst the Member States of the Arab League sharea common hostility to Israel, they are divided by the long-standing rivalry anddislike between the Hashemite Rulers of Iraq and Jordan, on the one hand, and king Ibn Saud (who expelled this family from his dominions in 1926) and king farouk. This rivalry has been particularly manifested in violent opposition byEgypt and Saudi Arabia to any form of &quot; Greater Syria &quot; project He., a unionbetween Syria and either Iraq, or Jordan, or both), which they regard as liable toincrease unduly the power of the Hashemites.12. The Tripartite Statement, referred to in paragraph 9, equally constitutes a guarantee against an attempt by any Arab State to attack, or absorb, another arab state by force, but this does not seem to be generally recognised.13. Turkey and the Arab States. Turkey, since the Arab States were ampu-tated from her after World War I, has made no attempt to interfere in their affairs.Syria has had a quarrel with her since 1938, when the French allowed her to annex the Syrian province of Alexandretta. But while her relations with the Arab states are outwardly good, they are still suspicious of her, and there is evidence that anyattempt to bring her into close co-operation with them would be resisted.14. The Arab League. The Arab League, founded in 1944 in response tosome British encouragement, has proved incapable of promoting any practical measures of inter-Arab co-operation and proved entirely ineffective in the face of israel in 1948. It is also split, as indicated above, by internecine disputes. It does,however, respond to a deep-rooted sentiment amongst the Arabs that there shouldbe unity amongst the Arab-speaking peoples, and although it sometimes, appearsmoribund its members always tend to stand together against any outside Power.At the United Nations, for example, the Arab States usually vote as a bloc; andthey have adopted a common front in opposition to Israel and the Western powers over Palestine, to the French over Syria and the Lebanon, and more recently to united Kingdom policy over Libya and to the French over Morocco. The League,in fact, has a nuisance value which must be reckoned with. Since Egypt plays theleading role in it, any deterioration in Anglo-Egyptian relations risks bringing theLeague into increased opposition to the United Kingdom in all fields.
Relations between the Middle East and Foreign Powers. ^ ;,; , !T;   m- .n,......;:--.15. United Kingdom.^-While the United Kingdom still commands on thewhole more influence and goodwill in the Middle East than any other foreign Power,we have in the past few years been encountering increasing difficulties. These derivemainly from the pressure of increasing nationalist sentiment, seeking to whittledown such privileges or influence as we still enjoy; in the Arab States there is stilldeep-rooted resentment against us for the part we are deemed to have played in facilitating the establishment of Israel. (It will be recalled that German propaganda,playing on this theme, was responsible for the Iraqi revolt against us in 1941.)16. Particular points at issue between the United Kingdom arid the Statesof the area as are follows:   :&apos;        il0 &apos; /; &apos;(a) Persia. A separate paper has been submitted on the present Anglo-Persiandispute regarding the &quot;nationalisation&quot; of the Anglo-Iranian oil company industry.(b) Egypt. The Anglo-Egyptian dispute is not only vitiating Anglo-Egyptianrelations, but is liable to create trouble for us throughout the arab world, in view of the existence of the Arab solidarity already referred to.(c) Iraq. The Persian oil dispute shows signs of creating a similar demand in Iraq for the &quot; nationalisation &quot; of the Iraq Petroleum Company oil installations there.As from 1952 the Iraq Government have the right to demand nego-negotiation for the revision of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. The extent to whichthey press for the modification of the present strategic facilities is likelyto depend largely on the outcome of the dispute with Egypt.    :17. United States and France. The only other foreign Powers with substan-tial interests in the area are the United States and France. The former has large oilinterests, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf, and military missions in Persia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and has of late been devoting greatly increasedattention to economic development and to political and strategic problems. france has an alliance with Turkey and extensive cultural interests and some oil interestsin the area, but is chiefly concerned to re-establish her political predominance in syria and the Lebanon. Neither has much political influence; the United states is generally regarded as politically inexperienced and in the Arab States is the objectof even more resentment than the United Kingdom over her past Palestine policy,while France is disliked for her past treatment of Syria and the Lebanon.18. The United States generally collaborate closely with Us in the Middle East,but have been critical and somewhat unhelpful in Persia and have shown somereluctance to co-operate in defence in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Our relationswith France are less close (though she was a co-partner with us and the UnitedStates in the Tripartite Statement of 1950) and are periodically troubled byunjustified French suspicions that we are seeking political influence at their expensein Syria and the Lebanon.19. Russia. The Russian Missions in Middle East countries maintain contact with the local Communist Parties and disseminate propaganda on the usual lines.Apart from Persia, however, Communism has so far had small success and isproscribed except in Israel. Occasional indications of Arab support for Russia(e.g., at the United Nations) are usually intended as a form of blackmail, designedto induce the Western Powers to take the Arab side against Israel. The presentIsrael Government is keeping Communism firmly in check. Turkish resistance toRussia is whole-hearted.Conclusions20. The present state of the Middle East must be regarded as unsatisfactory,both internally and from the point of view of United Kingdom interests. Apartfrom Turkey and, to some extent, Israel, all the component States are weak,indifferently governed, unstable, and in need of economic development and socialreform. Turkey appears staunchly determined to stand by the terms of our Treatyof Alliance with her and to resist Russia, and Israel would almost certainly resistaggression from anywhere; but while the Arab States are generally favourable to theWest and suspicious of Russia, and are beginning to co-operate with us in defence planning, it is doubtful how far any of them, still less Persia, could be relied uponto resist Russian aggression unaided.  Bilateral defence arrangements between the
United Kingdom and individual Arab States, and with Israel, may be feasible andthe possibilities are being explored, but the chances of promoting a regional middle east.defence, organisation seem negligible, if only because of Arab-Israel hostility.21. His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s relations with Turkey are excellent; withIsrael they are improving. Our relations with the other States, while generally good,are threatened by the rising tide of nationalism, which in Egypt and Persia hasalready involved us in serious disputes and which may soon do so in Iraq. On our success in finding solutions to these disputes which shall take account of reasonablenationalist sentiment depends the maintenance Of our influence, and of our vital oiland strategic interests, in the area.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,29th March, 1951.
