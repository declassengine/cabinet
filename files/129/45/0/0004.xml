HIS DOCUMENT-IS THE PROPERTY OF -HIS britannic-MAo ES-T Y-&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(51) 79 COPY NO. 3 I15TH MARCH, 1951CABINETRETAIL PRICES OF SUBSIDISED FOODSTUFFSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of FoodAs was foreshadowed in E,P,C.(51) 4, both imported and home produced food is going to cost substantially more in the coming financialyear.    We are facing something like a world-wide inflation of prices,and although our long-term contracts have insulated us to some degreefrom the full effects of this inflation in the ,current financial year, higher prices will have to be paid in 1-951/52 if we are to maintain the necessaryvolume of imports to this country,,    As regards home produced food-stuffs, the negotiations with the National Farmers&apos; Union are still pro-ceeding but it is probable that the outcome will be that something of theorder of  30millions will have to be added to the prices paid to farmersfor their products in the coming financial year,2, In the light of the foregoing factors it is now estimated that ifpresent retail prices of subsidised foodstuffs remained unchanged thetotal subsidy in 1951/52 would be  517. 6 millions.The main reasons for the increase of this estimate above theearlier figure of  470 millions given in E.P0C,(51) 4 are the inclusionof provision to cover the anticipated increased costs of meat as a resultof a settlement with the Argentine and Uruguay, when achieved, and an element of  21 millions in respect of a continuing subsidy on animalfeedingsiuffs as a result of higher prices now ruling which cannot be passed on to the farmers without also increasing the price of home-grownfeedingstuffs and wheat0    This would lead to increases in the price ofother farm produce, so as to maintain the pattern of production we want,e.nd all these increases would inflate farm incomes unnecessarily.3. On the basis of a subsidy total of  517. 6 millions and on theassumption of a 1951/52 subsidy ceiling of  410 millions it will benecessary to secure savings amounting to  I07o 6 millions by means of retail price increases.    We have considered what these increases shouldbe - on a balance of all the various factors involved, political, nutritional,the effect on the Interim Index and so on - and put forward the recommen-dations summarised in the appendix,    (There is a division of opinion between us on one item - milk - which is shown at the foot of the table.Further reference is made to this in paragraph 6,)4. It is of course possible to devise a number of permutations andcombinations of retail price increases which would yield a total ofapproximately  107 millions in 1951/52,    We have not felt it necessary,however, to lengthen this paper by trying to set out a number of variantsof the foregoing proposals.
5, The following are brief comments on the proposed individualincreases(a) MEAT.       This is included primarily because it will help tobring home to the public the additional outlay which we must male if weare to get increased supplies involving substantially higher procurementcosts,(b) TEA.    The Minister of Food would like to eliminate the subsidy on tea, for which there is no specific nutritional justification and thecontinuance of which is anomalous now that he has no longer direct con-trol over purchase prices.    But to remove the subsidy in one operation would involve a substantial increase in retail prices.    We therefore propose that there should be two price increases during 1951/52, one inMay and the other in September.    This will leave a relatively smallsubsidy remaining on which action could, if thought appropriate, be takenin 1952/53,The question of exempting old age pensioners from the price increase has been examined but the conclusion has had to be reached that any such scheme would be administratively impracticable.(c) BREAD AND FLOUR.    Bread is,unrationed and involvesdollar imports of wheat and flour:  the prices of these commodities arehigh and are not likely to fall:  and the retail price of bread has increasedonly 30% since before the war.    The proposed increases would reducethe baking subsidy by 3s. Od a sack of flour used for bread-making, with consequential administrative advantage:  and would moreover serve to counteract any temptation to feed bread and flour to livestock arisingfrom the increased prices of feedingstuffs.(d) SUGAR.    An increase in the domestic price of Id a lb. wouldmean that the Ministry of Food would still make a small loss on sales for domestic consumption but would make a substantial profit overall.This may lead to representations from manufacturers, since it will nolonger be possible to claim that the profit made on the sales of sugar tothem is needed to offset a substantial loss on sales of domestic sugar.(e) FATS.    The proposed increases in the prices of butter and margarine will mean that the differential between these two commoditieswill become ls.4d instead of Is. 2d as at presents    It is thought, however,that even with a price of 2s. 6d butter supplies will be fully taken up andthat there will not be any great swing of demand to margarine.The prices of margarine and cooking fat sold to trade users havealready been raised because of increased costs and the proposed price increases will restore the relationship between trade user prices and domestic prices to the old 1950/51 level.6. MILK.     There is a difference of opinion between us as to thedesirability of including in our proposals a recommendation that the retail price of milk should be raised during eight months of the year(1st July - 28th February) by Id a quart.The Chancellor of the Exchequer considers that a small increase in the retail price of milk in the eight-month period when thereis no problem of surplus milk supplies would be justified in view of
(i) the very high cost of the milk subsidies (now over  100 millions),(ii) the low effect of any price increase on the Index and (iii) the desira-bility of reintroducing the concept of a seasonal retail price for milk.The size of the milk subsidy in relation to total food subsidies (about a quarter), is becoming embarrassing;  the difficulty about reducing itsprings partly from lack of information about the effect of retail price increases on consumption:  a modest increase in price would help to assess the effect of any further adjustments which circumstances maynecessitate in later years.The Minister of Food is opposed to this proposal on the grounds that an increase in milk prices will tend to diminish the consumption of milk by the section of the population most in need of it.    Moreover,there would be some reason to fear that such a decline in consumption would continue even in the period of the year when milk prices were reduced in the seasonal flush period, and this would accentuate thedifficulty of disposing Of flush supplies.    Despite the overall increasethere is still a marked difference in milk consumption as betweenpeople at various income levels,    For these reasons, the minister would prefer to find the total saving necessary without recourse to any increase in the retail price of milk.7. If, however, it were decided that the retail price of milk shouldbe increased in accordance with the Chancellors suggestion, the Ministerof Food would propose that this should replace the proposed increase ofIda lb. in the retail price of domestic sugar.8a &quot;We have given a good deal of thought to the question of when theproposed price increases should be announced.    Our conclusion is thatit would be preferable to announce the increases as far as possible at different dates rather than to make one comprehensive statement related to the Budget.    This would enable us, where appropriate, to link the price increases with increased costs of procurement,&quot;We propose that the announcement of the increase in the priceof meat should be linked with the announcement of the settlement with theArgentine, when this is achieved, although the increase in price cannotbe brought into effect until some six weeks later.In the case of tea the first increase of 4d per lb. must take effect from the ZOth May, v/hich is the beginning of the Ministry of Food16-week permit period for tea rationing purposes.    But as the teaauctions are re-opening on the 16th April it is desirable to give the trade the maximum possible advance notice of the price increase since thiswill involve them in a good deal of preliminary work.    Accordingly we decided that in the special circumstances the announcement of this par-ticular price increase must precede consideration of this memorandum,and an announcement about the increase was made on the 14th March.So far as the other food price increases are concerned, we propose that these should be announced and put into effect so as to con-form most conveniently with the trade requirements of the Ministry ofFood.H.G.M.W.15th March, 1951.
