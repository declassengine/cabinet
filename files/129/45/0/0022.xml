yj 138(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT)SEC RE T..........C.P.(51) 9720TH APRIL, 1951COPY NO.CABINETJAPANESE PEACE TREATYINDIVIDUAL CLAIMS AGAINST Japan Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs was invited on 5th March to consider further, in consul&quot;tation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board ofTrade, whether it was necessary that any public statement should be madeat the present stage embodying the decision taken by the Cabinet on 2nd January (CM. (51) 1st Conclusions, Minute 4) to refrain from pressing for the inclusion in the Japanese Peace Treaty of an obligation on japan to pay individual claims for compensation for personal injury or ill-treatment or death or for damage to property outside Japan (CM, (51) 17thConclusions, Minute 3),2. I have consulted the Chancellor of the Exchequer and thePresident of the Board of Trade who agree with me that the followingpoints for and against making a public statement at this time are relevant:-Points against:(a)(b)It would be contrary to normally accepted practice forHis Majesty&apos;s Government to make a public statementof their decision not to pursue individual claims whilePeace Treaty negotiations are in progress.The decision would be bound to cause disappointment inthe country.Points for:(i)(ii)The Cabinet&apos;s decision referred to in paragraph 1 is theonly possible one on any realistic estimate of Japan&apos;capacity to pay,   Mr. Dulles is now known to have informed the Philippine Government in February that ifthey could suggest means whereby Japan could pay theirreparation claims of ^S,000 millions, which wouldnot involve a charge on the United States taxpayer theUnited States Government would support them.An all-Party motion on compensation for British far eastern Prisoners of War has now been put down for earlydebate, and it will give cause for complaint if reasons forJapan1 s non-payment of compensation are not fully explained.Five and a half years have elapsed since the end of hosti-facilities with Japan and those who have suffered at the hands ofthe Japanese and who have not received compensation should no longer be kept in ignorance of the real position.-1-
&apos;    13.9(iv) Since the Cabinet decided on 2nd January to approveC.P. (50) 322 on the subject of individual claims against japan, statements have been made in Parliament and in correspondence with M. Ps. and members of the public to the effect that a public statement on this question will, it is hoped, be made at an early date.(v) In the normal course of our discussions about the japanese peace Treaty, it would be necessary in the near future toinform the United States Government of the Cabinet&apos;decision not to press these claims against Japan.   Itwould also be necessary to inform the commonwealth governments, who as a result may themselves wish tomake a public statement in advance of the conclusionof the Treaty.(vi) It would be unfortunate if in the course of future negotiationsconcerning the Japanese Peace Treaty, the attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government on this delicate subject should firstbecome known as a result of indiscretions by otherGovernments.4. As regards the question&apos;of Japanese assets in the UnitedKingdom, His Majesty&apos;s Governments view to date has been that their disposal could not properly be considered until a Peace Treaty with japan had given us the right to liquidate and dispose of them.   However this neednot preclude us from stating how we propose to dispose of such assets as wemay obtain under the Peace Treaty.   Since the value of these assets willprobably be less than  l  million, their effect when divided up among thethousands of possible claimants would be insignificant.   I suggest that themost effective use of the money would be to apply it, in consultation withrepresentatives of prisoner-of-war organisations and societies representingthose who were interned by the Japanese, for the benefit of institutions and organisations whose work has been of the greatest help in rehabilitatingvictims of Japanese ill-treatment and cruelty.   This proposal is a departure from the precedent established by action taken to dispose of German andSatellite assets in the United Kingdom.   Those assets are to be used toprovide a dividend for British pre-war creditors of those countries or their nationals.   I recognise that my proposal may therefore attract criticism fromBritish pre-war creditors of Japan but in view of the small estimated valueof Japanese assets in this country I am confident that such criticism couldnot be seriously sustained.5. With the concurrence of the Chancellor and the President,I invite my colleagues to agree:(i) that a public statement of our decision not to pressindividual claims against Japan should be made at anearly date, after consultation with Commonwealth and colonial Governments;(ii) that the last two sentences of paragraph 8 of the draft statement (C.P.(51) 63) should be amended to state theintention of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the followingmanner:&quot;It is our intention to press for a clause in the peace treaty to provide for the transfer of these assets to HisMajesty&apos;s Government,    It goes without saying, however,
that this sum would be wholly inadequate to meet even theclaims already registered in the United Kingdom.Japanese assets held in British Colonial and Protectedterritories would be wholly inadequate to meet claims inthose territories.    The disposal of these assets also must,however, await the conclusion of a Peace Treaty and the subsequent decision of Colonial Governments. &quot;(iii) that a new paragraph in the following terms should beinserted after paragraph 9:&apos;It&apos;may with justice be asked, however, in what mannerHis Majesty&apos;s Government proposed to dispose of japanese assets in the United Kingdom once a Peace Treaty hasmade their realisation possible.    As has already been indicated, their estimated value amounts to a smallfraction of the value of the claims already registered inthis country.    The minute sub-division and distribution ofthis sum amongst the many thousands of deserving cases would confer little real benefit nor could such small sums inany sense be considered compensation for their losses and sufferings.   His Majesty1 s Government have therefore decided that after the Peace Treaty the net value of theJapanese assets in the United Kingdom which theyobtained should be used for the endowment or otherwisefor the benefit of organisations and institutions whose work has been and can be of most value in helping those, nowresident in the United Kingdom, who suffered, and the dependants in the United Kingdom of those who died as aresult of captivity or internment by the Japanese during thewar.   The Government propose further that the decision as to which particular organisations and institutions shallbenefit should be taken after consultation with representativesof associations of ex-prisoners-of-war and ex-interneesfrom the Far East and other interested parties. &quot;(iv) that an oral question should be put down and the answergiven that in view of the length of the reply it should be circulated with the official report.6. For convenience of reference I attach a revised draft ofthe statement incorporating the suggestions in paragraph 5 (ii) and (iii)above.H. M.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.,20TH APRIL, 1951.
annex draft OF A PUBLIC STATEMENT ON INDIVIDUALCLAIMS AGAINST JAPANWith the indulgence of the House I should like to make a statement. on the question of individual claims for loss of, or damage to, property andfor personal injury, ill-treatment and death suffered at Japanese handsduring the war.2. It is not the practice of His Majesty!s Government to make public the instructions which they propose to give to delegations entrusted with the negotiation of treaties. - However, they consider that the present case isexceptional, first because a Japanese peace treaty has been long delayed,and, secondly, because no international agreement concerning the paymentof individual claims comparable to the resolutions contained in the finalAct of the Paris Conference on Reparation has beei concluded amongst thePowers at war with Japan.   In these special circumstances the government believe that a statement of their attitude at this time will be in the publicinterest.   (I am not referring to any questions relating to the ultimatesettlement of outstanding pre-war debts.)3. Individual claims against Japan fall into two main classes;first, claims in respect of loss of or damage to property, including financiallosses, within Japan or in territories over-run by the Japanese duringthe war;  and secondly, claims arising out of personal injury, ill-treatment and death in respect of both civilians, including internees, and members ofthe Armed Forces as prisoners of war.   Claims already registered by individuals with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom on a voluntary basis and with the Governments of Colonial and Protectedterritories in respect of these categories are estimated to amount to several hundred million pounds.4. It was originally the intention that such claims should be pursued against&apos;the Japanese Government.   This would require a clause in the peace treaty obliging the Japanese Government to meet claims of the categories referred to above which might be made by the nationals of anyof the forty-nine States at war with Japan.5. As regards British property situated in Japan, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment intend to continue to press for its restoration intact, and where this is impossible for proper compensation which could of course be paidin yen,6. As regards other claims it is necessary to take into accountJapan&apos;s capacity to pay in foreign exchange sums of the magnitude involved.The present position is that Japan remains a financialliability to the AlliedPowers,   Essential imports of food and raw materials for Japan have cost the United States Government little short of $1 million a day for the last fiveyears.   On any realistic estimate therefore, Japan would be quite unableto find the very large sums in foreign exchange required to meet all theindividual claims which would be made.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government have the deepest sympathy with thoseof all races who suffered at the hands of the Japanese, particularly with therelatives of those who died and all those  who suffered injury or ill-treatmentBut in the circumstances they have reluctantly reached the conclusionthat it is not practicable to press for the inclusion in a peace treaty with japan of an obligation to pay individual claims for loss of and damage to property situated outside Japan and for personal injury and ill-treatmentwherever suffered.
8. It may be suggested that, on the analogy of the action taken by theUnited States Government, Japanese assets now held in the United Kingdomand its dependent territories should be applied to meet these claims.Honourable Members will recall that, as was stated in the House on 28thApril, 1949, the estimated net value of Japanese assets in the United kingdom is somewhere between one and one and a quarter million pounds sterling.   Itis our intention to press for a clause in tho Peace Treaty to provide forthe transfer of these assets to His Majesty&apos;s Government.   It goes without saying, however, that this sum would be wholly inadequate to meet eventhe claims already registered in the United Kingdom.   Japanese assetsheld in British Colonial and Protected territories would be wholly inadequate to meet claims in those territories.   The disposal of these assets alsomust, however, await the conclusion of a Peace Treaty and the subsequentdecision of Colonial Governments.9. In this situation His Majesty&apos;s Government have considered towhat extent individual claims in respect of damage to property or hardshipor personal injury caused by Japanese war-time acts could be met from theUnited Kingdom Exchequer.   This Government, like their war-timepredecessors, have taken the view that it would be out of the question forthe State to attempt to recompense every form of loss or hardship suffered by its citizens as a result of the war.   The general policy adopted withregard to United Kingdom residents has been to provide for theirrehabilitation.   To this end, provision has been made for certain payments in respect of war damage or loss of personal chattels.   Illnesses havebeen treated and pensions have been awarded for residual disablement ordeath resulting from personal injury.   Certain United Kingdom residentswho have suffered damage to private property or personal injury atJapanese hands are already eligible for awards on this basis under existing schemes - e. g. Far Eastern Private Chattels Scheme;   special provisions analogous to the United Kingdom Personal Injuries (Civilians)Scheme;  and the Ministry of Pensions warrants relating to pensions, etc. ,for members of the Armed Forces.   Special steps were taken, and are still being taken, to secure the rehabilitation of those whose health was affectedby the appalling sufferings which they endured in captivity in Japanese hands.This was a clear duty owed to these ex-captives by their more fortunatefellow citizens.   But it is a different matter to provide out of UnitedKingdom taxes some financial benefit in addition to rehabilitation, treatment and pensions, and it would clearly be difficult to make any distinction for thispurpose between the victims of Japanese war-time acts and those who have suffered as the result of the action of other enemies of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment during the recent war.   Honourable Members will recall thestatement made on behalf of the Government in this matter by myhonourable friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War in the debate on 13th June, 1950.   After very careful consideration the Governmenthave decided that it would be wrong to lay upon the United Kingdom tax-payer the additional burden entailed in the payment from public funds of awards in respect of individual claims beyond those already provided.10. It may with justice be asked, however, in what manner HisMajesty&apos;s Government propose to dispose of Japanese assets in the UnitedKingdom once a peace treaty has made their realisation possible.   As hasalready been indicated , their estimated value amounts to a small fraction of the value of the claims already registered in this country.   The minutesub-division..and distribution of this sum among the many thousands ofdeserving cases would confer little real benefit nor could such small sumsin any sense be considered compensation for their losses and sufferings.His Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore decided that after the Peace -
Treaty the net value of the Japanese assets in the United Kingdom whichthey obtained shall be used for the endowment or otherwise forthe benefit of organisations and institutions whose work has been and canbe of most value in helping those now resident in the United Kingdom whosuffered, and the dependants in the United Kingdom of those who died,as a result of captivity or internment by the Japanese during the war.The Government propose further that the decision as to which particularorganisations and institutions shall benefit should be taken after consultationwith representatives of associations of ex-prisoners of war and ex-interneesfrom the Far East and other interested parties,11. I recognise that these decisions may cause some disappointmentto many.   His Majesty&apos;s Government have, however, decided that it.wouldbe preferable to make a public statement of the present position and thereasons for their decisions in order not to sustain hopes which they can see no prospect of fulfilling.
