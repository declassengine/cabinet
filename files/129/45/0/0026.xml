THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet:  A pril i 1951C.P.

They proposed thatan Kod hoc committee should be entrusted with the task of &quot; studying the ways inwhich a development towards the ends indicated in their memorandum might best be promoted.&quot;... 2. The Swedish proposal was considered at the last nteetingiOf Hie MimslerialCouncil of the O.E.E.C. Although there was strong&apos; pressure or an ad hoc committee to be set up at once, the Council, as a result of a negative attitude onthe part of the United Kingdom, decided that Governments should have furthertime to consider the question and that it should be discussed at an informal meetingof Ministers at the time of the next meeting of the Council. I myself will be repre-senting His Majesty&apos;s Government at this meeting, which takes place on 27th April.The discussion will deal both with the merits of the Swedish proposals and also with the advisability of setting up a committee to examine them further. Thesetwo questions are examined below.3. The Swedish Government would also like their representative on theCouncil to pass through London on his way to Paris for a preliminary discussionwith us. We have agreed to this. &apos;The Merits of the Swedish Proposal4. The O.E.E.C. is a valuable instrument for working out practical measuresof inter-governmental co-operation. Though its importance may diminish withthe development of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) and thetermination of Marshall aid, its work is still sufficiently important for us not to wish it to be compromised by any constitutional change.5. The Council of Europe, on the other hand, is a consultative organisationdesigned as a forum for the expression of European opinion, and should so remain,at any rate for some time to come. Its constitution is centred on the consultative assembly which has shown itself to be an irresponsible body. It is quite unadaptedto the task of working out practical measures of economic co-operation.6. It would not be possible to devise a new organisation which could effectivelyperform these separate functions of the two existing organisations. The impossi-bility of debarring the Consultative Assembly from interfering with whateverpractical work was committed to the proposed new organisation is a conclusiveargument against showing any favour for the time being to the Swedish Govern-ment&apos;s proposal. To do so would endanger the valuable and substantial degree ofEuropean economic co-operation laboriously achieved in the O.E.E.C.40471
The. Formation of a Committeeuto Examine the Proposals^7. The United Kingdom representative on the O.E.E.C. has reported that the swiss and Portuguese Governments are hostile to the Swedish proposals, that theFrench, and to a lesser extent the Austrians and Dutch, are in favour of it, andthat the ?other member Governments are either lukewarm or have hot made up their minds. But he does not think that any of the other Governments would wish to object to the appointment of a committee to examine the proposals.]?;8. It would, however, be safer if no committee were appointed at this stage.whatever its terms of reference. Once the organisation are committed to examining the Swedish proposals it will be more difficult for us to block them. But we may notbe able to oppose the appointment of a committee without finding ourselves in isola-rtion and it would in fact be without precedent in the organisation for a proposal tobe rejected without study.9. If our hostility to their proposals is plainly expressed to the Swedish repre-sentative in a preliminary discussion in London and is propagated by our representative on the O.E.E.C. among his colleagues in Paris, there may be lesspressure at the Council of Ministers itself.Conclusions10. (.1) His Majesty&apos;s Government should oppose any early implementation ofthe Swedish proposals;(2) They should seek to prevent the appointment at this stage of any committeeto examine the proposals;(3) But if strongly pressed they should acquiesce in the appointment of such acommittee, provided its terms of reference in no way prejudge the main issue.at       m ^uvhmt&apos;: \o to-pilj-tfjiw baizupnt m     /;^-;-;.vv:    h.
