ANNEX a text OF PERSONAL MESSAGE OF 1ST MAY &apos;   ,;FROM UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF state to UNITED KINGDOM FOREIGN SECRETARY&quot;I am writing you about some of our common problems,especially those relating to the Far East.    We each ought to understand the other&apos;s position - what we think; why we think it.    We start fromthe common ground of desiring peace and security in the Pacific and theearliest conclusion of the Korean conflict.    We agree that the united nations must fight the attack in Korea.    We are doing everything possibleto limit the fighting in Korea.This country, which fronts on two oceans, has heavy responsi-responibilities in the Pacific, as well as in the Atlantic.    It is properly anddeeply concerned with the problems of the Pacific and is making greatsacrifices towards their solution.The real problem is how to achieve our agreed aims in Korea,The attack must be repelled, and it must be shown that its continuancewill not pay.Short of a change in the aggressive Communist purpose, I do not see how hostilities can cease.    So long as this purpose persists there willbe fighting in Korea.    So far there has been no indication of a change inpurpose.    In fact, a new and massive offensive is under way.Under these circumstances, we must fight.    And our economicand political measures and attitudes should back up our military ones.We must convince the enemy that a cessation of hostilities is in his interest,I believe that it is essential to make plain in every sensible way that our military objective is a limited one, and that the fighting can andwill stop when the aggression stops.There are many indications that a major air attack may be launched at any time against the United Nations forces from bases onChinese Territory,    If this occurs, we must assume that a decision hasbeen made to attempt to drive the United Nations forces from Korea what-ever the cost or consequences.    Under these circumstances, it may beimperative to attack the bases from which the attack upon our forces come.Should this air blow be launched against us, the safety of theforces, land, sea and air, will be gravely imperilled.    Time will be a factor of the most vital importance in launching a counter blow against the bases from which the attack comes.We realise fully that the governments which have forces in korea are deeply concerned in this decision, and for this reason we havebeen holding consultations to reach the widest possible agreement on theprocedure to be followed.    The particular circumstances of an attackcannot be anticipated, but I think we can anticipate that the decision of how to meet the attack, if there is a major one, would have to be made at once.As a practical matter, consultation after the event between Washington and london - to say nothing of additional consultations with the other govern-ments - would require the passage of hours, even days, at a time of graveperil to our forces.    For these reasons, we believe that this Government,
as the unified command, must retain the latitude to determine whether anattack requires immediate counter action in order to preserve the safety of the forces.    This requires confidence on the part of our Allies that thedecision will be soberly and wisely made, with full realisation of authorityinvolved,    I think that the course which the President and the Joint Chiefsof Staff have followed over many months has justified this confidence,I think also that the authority to take counter action to preserve a commandis inherent in and essential to the very conception of command.    Anyother view would leave this Government with the responsibility for theforces - our own and those of other nations - engaged in Korea, but unableto take a step which may prove to be essential to preserve their veryexistence.This Government profoundly hopes that the necessity for thedecision which I have been discussing will never be presented to it.But it cannot rest upon that hope.    The Chinese are plainly playing for amilitary decision.    They have still large bodies of troops uncommitted.We cannot close our eyes to the possibility of a reckless and desperateplay on their part at some point in the battle.Another question which has been much discussed between ourgovernments is the use of economic measures to aid the military ones.In your message which your Embassy let us see on April 27thyou voiced objection to the Additional Measures Committee rushing ahead and submitting a report at once to the Political Committee of the general assembly.    I do not believe that the issue is really one between precipitate action and considered and deliberate action.The proposal for economic measures has been under discussionsince last January, and the resolution of the General Assembly providingfor a committee to consider it was taken on February 1st,    At that time it was understood that the committee might defer its report if the good offices Committee reported satisfactory progress.    It was also understoodthat the Additional Measures Committee was not required to remaininactive until the other committee reported failure.    For almost threemonths now the Good Offices Committee has been at work, and yet itcannot even report progress.Under these circumstances, I do not believe that continuedinaction by the Additional Measures Committee is helping to bring aboutor to increase the possibility of negotiations for peaceful settlement.   Onthe contrary, I think that it suggests timidity and indecision on the part ofthe United Nations,In the past some members of the United Nations have believedthat the development of economic measures would further alienate theChinese Communists and increase their hostility.    I do not see how theirhostility can be increased.    I do not see any possibility of any basicrealignment of the Chinese Communists toward the free world unless anduntil they end their attack,    A prerequisite of this seems to be a conclusion on their part that to end the attack is in their interest.    So it seems to methat the addition of economic measures to the military ones we are already taking will move the Chinese in the direction of this decision and that failure to take them moves them away from it.Moreover, what we are actually proposing is that urgent consider-ation should be given to the adoption of a resolution calling for an embargo on raw materials for Communist China and the establishment of review
procedures which would make possible changes in the initial jmbargo inthe light of actual developments in China and Asia and in the experienceof co-operating countries in applying their respective control measures.The United States has done much more than this and has endedall commercial and financial relations with Communist China.    We would welcome similar action by all United Nations members.    But we recognise the great importance of unity in action; and, therefore, in the effort to getgeneral agreement, suggest something considerably less than what wehave done.So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, what we have proposedmeans little more than proclaiming publicly what is already being done.However, public agreement upon these measures in the united nations and their extension to other countries would, we think, be a demonstration of a united will to participate in a collective programmedesigned to diminish the war-making power of the Chinese communists and to bring home to the Chinese the increasing cost to them of the courseupon which they are embarked.In the political field our Governments have differed in the pastregarding the wisdom and advisability of admitting the Chinese Communiststo the United Nations.    Whatever may have been the merits of this debate,can we not now agree to a moratorium upon it.?    At a time when theChinese Communists are defying the United Nations, fighting its forces ona major scale, and denying the validity of every provision of the charter,the discussion of their possible admission to the United Nations seems tome to have the most devisive possible effect between us and to give them the greatest encouragement in continuing their present course.It is difficult everywhere in this country, and in all the countrieswhich are supplying forces in Korea, to keep our peoples constantly alive to the Tightness and necessity of,the sacrifices which have to be made fora struggle limited in its nature and not susceptible of the conceptions of victory to which people have become accustomed.    To add to these diffi-culties discussion of admitting the enemy to the organisation which they are fighting seems to me so utterly confusing to the average man as to imperil the whole United Nations operation in Korea.I am still giving careful thought to the possibility which we suggestedlast month, and which you also developed on somewhat different lines, of having a new declaration of aims which will re-emphasise our desire forpeaceful settlement upon conclusion of the aggression.    We will have furthertalks with officers of your Embassy during the coming weeks,    I am sure,however, that you are already aware of the serious objections which we haveto certain elements in your counter-proposal.    These objections can be developed in detail during the forthcoming talks.In any event it is my immediate suggestion that the present moment is not an opportune one for a public statement.    The military issue in Koreais still being fought out.    General Ridgway believes that he can meet andrepulse the attack.    It is clearly a great one and not yet fully developed.In this situation any statement by us looking towards a peaceful settlement is, in my judgment, sure to be rejected with contempt as a try for peacefrom nations which are sorely pressed.    So I think we would retardrather than help the chances of a peaceful settlement by a statement now.&quot;
ANNEX B -DRAFT REPLY 3Y THE FOREIGN SECRETARY TOTHE UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE&apos;S&quot;MESSAGE OF 1ST MAY, 1951I have given careful thought to the frank and friendly message youconveyed to me through Mr. Gifford.    We start, as you say, from thecommon ground of desiring peace and security in the Pacific, theearliest conclusion of the Korean conflict, and the limitation of thefighting to that country.    I share also your determination that ,the attack in Korea must be repelled.    We too have heavy responsibilities in the pacific and South East Asia area.I agree that it is difficult to see how the campaign in Korea canbe ended short of a change in the aggressive purpose of the Communists.Aggression must be opposed, and must be shown to be not worth while.There can be no compromise on this.    So long as the Chinese continue their aggression in Korea they must be made to realise that they willmeet with steady and collective resistance and that the fighting will stoponly if they put an end to their aggression.    It must be unmistakably shownthat the responsibility for any extension of hostilities is theirs.    Meetingaggression is the immediate problem in Korea.    The long-term problem is the future of the country, and I do not think we should seek to impose apolitical settlement on North Korea by force if we can possibly solve theproblem by negotiation and agreement.   I believe therefore that we mustlose no opportunity to reach a pacific settlement should the Chinese and north Koreans show any willingness to negotiate, or if we can lead themthat way.This brings me to the possibility of bombing Chinese bases in theevent of heavy air attacks on United Nations forces. I agree with you thatif such raids occur there will be no alternative but to meet this new threatby the most effective military means at our disposal, namely by bombing
-    32ftthe bases in China from which the attacks have been launched.    Thiswill involve serious risks of an extension of the war, perhaps even intoa global conflict; but the consequences will have to be faced and shared by all of us.In these circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government have decidedthat in the event of heavy (repeat heavy) air attacks from bases in Chinaon United Nations forces in Korea, they will associate themselves withthe policy of retaliatory action against these bases in order to preventfurther attacks and to minimise casualties to United Nations forces in korea.This is a decision in principle.    The consequences (which maybe general war) are so grave that the&apos;decision (so far as our participation /is concerned) must/be subject to confirmation by us at the time.    We have full confidence in the President and the Administration, and are sure thatthe decision would (as you say) be taken &quot;soberly and wisely&quot;.    It is however not a question of confidence, but of responsibility for a major act of policy, and we cannot divest ourselves of it.May I at the same time put to you the suggestion that, just as onour side the decision will be subject to confirmation at the time by thePrime Minister, the existing authorisation by the President should on yourside be confirmed by him?It is important that no military risks should be incurred throughdelay, and to avoid these we have made arrangements whereby we can make our decision at very short notice.    To enable us to do so it is essentialthat the fullest factual information should be supplied to us regarding thescale and nature of the attacks upon United Nations forces immediatelythey take place.    Can you arrange for this to be done through the BritishJoint Services Mission in Washington or by any other means which will ensure that we have at our disposal the necessary data on which to confirmour present decision in principle?    Meanwhile it would be useful to have
the evidence which mates you expect such attacks.    Our advisers, on thebasis of such information as they have at present, are by no means con-vinced that it is in the power of the Chinese to launch heavy and repeatedair attacks.I understand that at the &quot;briefing meetings&quot; in the State Depart-ment your views on the necessity for retaliatory air action have beenmade known to certain Governments.    If you would be so good as to let us know with which Governments this question has been discussed, Ishall consider what we should do.    I have in mind particularly theGovernments of France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and SouthAfrica.    I consider that His Majesty&apos;s Government should inform at leastthese Governments of the decision taken by us.   In order that we may doso it would be desirable that they should first be informed of your views.I would therefore hope that you would feel able to consult them now as fully as you have consulted us.Air attacks from bases in Soviet territory would raise separate and even graver problems, and our present decision does not cover this contingency.    We should therefore wish to be consulted fully before wecould agree to retaliatory action against these bases also.It would be helpful to us to have your assessment of the militaryand political consequences which you consider might follow any attack onChinese bases, and in particular, your estimate of the Soviet attitude tosuch an attack.You refer to sanctions against China.   As you know, we are opposed to political sanctions.    They would not influence the course ofthe campaign in Korea and indeed would have little effect on China except to strengthen the hands of the Chinese Government against those sectionsof Chinese opinion who still look to the west.    These sections of opinionare not politically important in China today, but there is nothing to gain by allowing the Russians to point to futile political sanctions as further evidence of the implacable hostility of the west to the new China.
-    331Economic sanctions I view differently.    For a long time we havekept an eye on trade with China to ensure that no goods of direct military value reached her from British sources.    The system has worked wellso far as concerns most of the goods that could directly assist the Chinesewar effort in Korea, except in the case of rubber, and there we had to take steps last month to check the increasing exports of rubber from malaya and Singapore to China even though the restrictions cannot be fully effective without the co-operation of other producers and purchasers.    There hasbeen so much misunderstanding of our policy in the matter of trade with china that we have considered it necessary to make public what the policy has been.May I say a word about Hong Kong?    It is simply not possible to cut off Hong Kong from China without giving rise to the gravest internalproblems of unemployment, starvation and unrest - in other words, with-out creating for Communism the ideal conditions in which it can flourish*What we have been trying to do is to ensure, with as little publicity aspossible (in order to minimise repercussions in Hong Kong) that exports from Hong Kong do not contribute to the Chinese war effort.    In this wehave been much more successful than your or our own Press gives uscredit for.    To go to the extreme limit of cutting off trade between HongKong and the mainland in ordinary consumer goods and in foodstuffs wouldmake no difference whatsoever to the fighting in Korea, and would on theother hand risk the loss of an important centre of free speech and westernideas.    Everyone (Chinese included) who goes to Hong Kong from Chinabreathes more freely and senses the contrast.    Is this of no value inthe world wide war of ideas?    With its fine harbour Hong Kong, in wronghands, would be a menace to the South China seas.    I am sure you wouldnot wish to give it to China.
-    332In considering sanctions against China I would ask you to bearthese things in mind.    They explain why we would oppose general economic sanctions against China.    There is another important reason why we wouldhesitate to follow your example:  we believe that there would not be general support amongst European and Asian countries for such a policy, and that pressure to adopt it would weaken the United Nations.As regards a selective embargo against war materials, however,we are with you and indeed this has been our policy for some time.    Butwe desired to give the Good Offices Committee ample time to exhaust thepossibilities of making contact with Peking.    Delay by the additional measures Committee meant little in practice; the principal supplying countries were already applying restrictions which in the main exceededwhat is now proposed for the United Nations.It was not on the substance of the proposals, but on the timing,that you and we have hitherto not seen eye to eye.    In view however of thetime which has now elapsed and in deference to your request, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have now decided that there is no longer any reason to delaysubmission of a resolution from the Additional Measures Committee to theAssembly recommending the imposition of a selective embargo on thesupply of war materials to China.   I do not exclude the possibility of extending the list now under consideration at Lake Success to furtherspecific items of strategic importance;  but I would continue to oppose its extension into a general embargo.You mentioned Chinese representation at the United Nations.Our views have been put on record.    As I said to Mr. Gifford, they flowednaturally from our conception of the doctrine of recognition.    To allow the effective Government of China to occupy the Chinese seat at the united nations is in no way a measure of weakness, but is inherent in the consti-tution of the United Nations.    I know that many people wonder why weshould support a proposal which if accepted would seat a Government at
-    333the council tables of the United Nations when that Government is engagedin military operations against United Nations forces which are resistingaggression.    I am interested in your suggestion of a &quot;moratorium&quot;, butam not clear what you have in mind.    Perhaps you could develop yourthought on this a little further.    Meanwhile, it seems to me that whatmatters is that we should both do what we can (the initiative in raising theissue does not of course lie with either of us, but with Russia) to preventour known differences of view on ihis point from developing into a source of misunderstanding between us.    The legal arguments for seating themthere are in our view conclusive, though I should certainly not wish to dis-play any enthusiasm in championing the claims of the Central People&apos;sGovernment of China at the United Nations so long as they are set on theirpresent course.    On the other hand, I could not act in such a way as mightimply support for the fiction that Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s representative in theUnited Nations speaks for China.The present is, as you say, not the moment for a public declarationof our aims in Korea.    Nevertheless, I believe that it is still of greatimportance to clarify our policy and state our aims (including constructive proposals for a settlement) as soon as ever it is practicable.    Publicopinion in this country, and I imagine in many others, is groping for guidance as to where we stand in Korea and what we are hoping to achieve.    Theopportunity may occur if the United Nations forces succeed in blunting theChinese offensive.    Perhaps the Chinese may by then be in a more chastenedmood and less unwilling to negotiate, but whether they are so or not I believethat we owe it to our peoples and to our troops to define our policy,    i therefore welcome your suggestion that further talks should be held with sir Oliver Franks about the form which this declaration should take.    Ishould like us to make suitable preparations for operation at the psychologicalmoment.
Mr. Gilford said to me that he thought our differences on far eastern policy had been narrowing in recent months.    I think that thisis true, and I am glad.    He went on to say however that he thought we might now be at a cross roads and our paths might begin to divergeagain.    I hope this is not so;  at any rate, if the risk exists, the best way to guard against it is for us to exchange occasional messages.That is why I especially valued the candour and friendliness of yourmessage, and I have tried to reply in the same spirit.
