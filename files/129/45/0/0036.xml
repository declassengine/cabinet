-    237HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST-Y-&apos;S GOVERNMENT)0CONFIDENTIALCP. (51) 111 COPY NO. 3117TH APRIL, 1951CABINETTHE STONE OF SCONEMemorandum by the Attorney-general  have given further anxious thought to the question of institutingproceedings in connection with the removal of the Stone of Scone from westminster abbey and I have reviewed all the evidence obtained by the police in the courseof their enquiries.2. I am satisfied that it would be unwise to prosecute for larceny orfor sacrilege.   The felony of larceny consists in &quot;fraudulently and without a claim of right made in good faith... taking something away...   with intentpermanently to deprive the owner thereof. &quot;   There is no doubt that the individuals concerned in the removal of the Stone were putting forward some sort of claim of right:  if they honestly believed in that claim, although it was ill-founded in law or fact, that would afford them a defence.   Moreover, it would be most difficult to establish any intention permanently to deprive the owner.   to deprive the owner temporarily is no theft - a fact which led to the alterationof the law some few years ago to meet the frequent cases of motor cars beingdriven away, used for a few days and then abandoned.   If in the present case thosewho removed the Stone said (as they probably could truly say) that their object was simply to get the Stone to Scotland and by depositing it there to raise apolitical controversy which might result in the Stone being allowed to remain,say, in St. Giles Cathedral, that would be a defence.   It is always difficult tosay how Juries will react:  my own impression is that on the facts here a Jurywould probably not convict of the felony of larceny.3. Similar considerations apply to sacrilege, an offence consisting inbreaking and entering a Church with intent to commit a felony therein.   In thepresent case one would have to establish an intent to commit the felony of larcenyand similar difficulties would aris&apos;e.4. There remains a possible charge of malicious damage to property.The wooden throne in Westminster Abbey was damaged in the course of theremoval of the Stone, the oak seat being slightly split and a wooden batten whichheld the Stone in position being broken.   The latter has been repaired on previous occasions.   I have personally examined the damage which was rather worse than   had understood.   None the less it seems clear that the damage can be made goodin a way which would conceal its existence.   The cost of making good the damage would be negligible.   It would be difficult, however, to assess the diminution in the value of this ancient throne by the fact that this damage hadbeen caused to it.   There is no doubt that the damage to the throne was an act of vandalism which it would be difficult to defend.   I have, however, although not without hesitation, come to the conclusion that I should not direct a prosecution in respect of it.   In a way the damage to the throne was incidental andcollateral to the main offence.   I do not belittle it but the fact is that public attention has been concentrated on the removal of the Stone and a prosecution^4&amp;vhich had no reference to the Stone might seem to some an anti-climax.   Moreover,
only one of the four concerned has admitted to causing the damage to the throne -accidentally as he says - and proceedings could only be taken against him andpossibly,   although with no certainty of success,   against the man actuallywith him at the time.5, In these circumstances I have to consider the question of instituting proceedings in the light of the general principles I indicated in a speech on the adjournment (Hansard, Cols. 683 - 690, 29th January, 1951).The Attorney-General never prosecutes simply because there is what thelawyers call a case.   Others can set the Criminal Law into motion:  he onlyintervenes in such offences as arise here when he considers the public interestdemands it.   I do not think that is the case here: there is no continuing offence,no great likelihood that such an offence will be repeated, no great principleof constitutional policy involved.   Moreover, I am satisfied that a prosecutionwould do no good except perhaps to the defendants to whom it would give theopportunity of being regarded as martyrs if they were convicted or as heroes ifthey were acquitted.   I am aware that the Archbishop and the Dean haveexpressed strong views which one can understand, but my impression is thatin general public opinion in England is bored with the whole matter and there iscertainly no enthusiam   for a prosecution.   In Scotland a prosecution would produce a very adverse reaction.6. I realise that there are some who will say that since, e.g. the dockers were prosecuted, these presumably middle class offenders should notbe allowed to go free.   I have, however, very rarely prosecuted for offencesconnected with Order 1305 although very many such offences have been committed.   In the recent case proceedings were taken because the offences were still continuing and there was a grave threat of their extension on a large scale.   The two cases are, therefore, totally different.7. Unless, therefore, my colleagues have other matters which they would wish me to consider, I propose to answer a Parliamentary Question on Thursdayin the following terms:&quot;Yes Sir.   Officers from Scotland Yard conducted very full and, ifI may say so, very able enquiries into this deplorable matter and Ihave   now considered their report.   The report included statements by three out of the four persons who are believed to have been concerned in removing the Stone from Westminster Abbey, inwhich each admitted the part he himself had played but did notimplicate others, indicate the then whereabouts of the Stone, orstate   how the Stone had become damaged.   No legally admissibleevidence has yet been secured as to those who planned and financedthe matter.   The clandestine removal of the Stone from West-minster Abbey was a vulgar and disgraceful act of hooliganismwhich has caused great distress and offence both in England and scotland, and has brought the individuals concerned and the causethey pretend to serve into great disrepute.   I do not, however,think that the public interest requires that I should directcriminal proceedings to be taken.&quot;H. W.S.Royal Courts of Justice, W. C. 2.,17TH APRIL, 1951.
