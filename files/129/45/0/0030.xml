THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS   GOVERNMENT 2 Q fiPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1951    . .....CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.  31CP. (51) 10516th April, 1951CABINETCOUNCIL OF europe memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe purpose of this paper is to describe1 the position which has now beenreached in connection with the revision of the Statute of the Council of Europe andto obtain the approval of my colleagues for a concession which the UnitedKingdom Representative might make when the question is discussed at the forth-coming meeting of the Committee of Ministers, which will be held in Strasbourgfrom 2nd-5th May.2. The revision of the Statute of the Council of. Europe was discussed at thelast meeting of the Committee of Ministers (which took place in Paris on 16th and17th March) on the basis of a report prepared by a Committee of government officials (see Annex to CP. (51) 72). The Ministers approved Chapters I and ii of this report, but did not have sufficient time to deal with Chapter III, which contains the proposed amendments to the Statute on which the officials were unable to reach agreement. These controversial amendments will be discussed atthe forthcoming meeting of the Committee of Ministers, when final decisions willprobably be taken on the revision of the Statute.3. The situation has been complicated by the observations made by theGeneral Affairs Committee of the Assembly on the officials&apos; report, which was referred to the Assembly for comments. This Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the report, which, in the Committee&apos;s view, did not go far enough towards meeting the views of the Assembly. The Committee stated that, in the circum-stances, it could not recommend parliaments to approve the ratification of a protocol which contained only those amendments on which the officials had reached agreement.4. These comments have dismayed some of the other member Governments notably the French and the Italian-who are very susceptible to parliamentarypressure where Council of Europe questions are concerned. They feel that, if the revision of the Statute becomes a bone of contention between the Government andthe parties of the majority, it may well prove one of many complex factors leading to a political crisis. Although a meeting of the Joint Committee will be held on16th April for an exchange of views between representatives of the Committee ofMinisters and the Assembly on the revision of the Statute, it is unlikely that thiswill do much to improve relations between the two organs of the Council. Thus,at the next meeting of the Committee of Ministers, we shall be under considerable pressure to make concessions on the controversial amendments, on many of whichwe are in a minority of one.5. I have therefore been looking carefully into Chapter III of the officials&apos;report to see if there is, in fact, some point on which we could make a concession,which would not be inconsistent with our policy on the revision of the Statuteset out in paragraph 5 of CP. (51) 72. : The object of such a concession would beto show other member Governments that we are not entirely obstructive wherethe Council of Europe is concerned and to ease the task of our representative inobtaining the rejection of the more obnoxious amendments in accordance withthe policy set out in CP. (51) 72, and approved by the Cabinet on 12th March(CM. (51) 19th Conclusions, Minute 5).&apos;    40441 :lm     &apos; ]-
6. I have come to the conclusion that, without sacrificing any of the principles on which our policy is based, we could agree, subject to certain modifications, tothe amendment dealt with in paragraph 31 of the officials&apos; report, which would permit the Assembly to discuss the political aspects of defence. This is an amend-ment to which the Assembly attaches considerable importance. Since, however,the Assembly has insisted on holding debates on defence questions in spite of theexisting provisions of the Statute, our concession would amount to no more thangiving statutory recognition to an existing state of affairs, which has been toleratedby the Committee of Ministers.7. We have always maintained the position that defence questions should remain outside the scope of the Council of Europe, on the grounds that the defenceof Western Europe is being dealt with by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation,and that discussion of the same issues by a purely European organisation, which includes non-N.A.T.O. countries, can only lead to duplication and confusion. , Wecould not, therefore, agree that the Committee of Ministers should be drawn intothe consideration of defence problems and make recommendations on defence questions to member Governments.8. On the other hand, we are faced with the fact that members of theAssembly have discussed defence questions in the past and there is no possibilityof preventing them from doing so in the future. The Labour Party representatives in the Assembly have persistently abstained from participation in such debates.This policy, however, is embarrassing for the Labour Party delegates, and has the disadvantage of allowing the case of His Majesty&apos;s Government to go by default.It is possible that, if the Labour delegates were free to take part in these debates,they would obtain support in modifying the Assembly&apos;s conclusions on defence matters and in preventing the Assembly from being used by the French Govern-ment as a sounding-board for the propagation of such ideas as the European Army.9. It therefore seems advisable, as well as logical, that we should hence-forward acquiesce in the discussion of the political aspects of defence by theAssembly. We should, however, still insist on the principle that decisions on defence matters are not within the competence of the Council of Europe, and that defence would therefore remain outside the scope of the Committee of Ministers.The object which I have in mind can be achieved by the amendment of two of theArticles of the Statute as shown in the annex to this paper. These incorporate oneof the amendments proposed by the Assembly, i.e., that the word &quot; political&quot; shouldbe inserted into Article 1 (b) of the Statute, but, at the same time, give the Committeeof Ministers incontrovertible legal grounds for refusing to consider recommenda-tions on defence emanating from the Assembly.10. The Council of Europe has hitherto devoted too much time to discussions on constitutional questions which have not only prejudiced relations between theCommittee of Ministers and the Consultative Assembly, but have also made ourown position in the Council of Europe particularly difficult. The preoccupation ofthe Assembly with the revision of the Statute has been partly due to the fact thatit has insufficient work to do, with the result that it has attempted to extend itsfield of action and to play a larger part in the management of European affairs.I am therefore anxious that we should find useful tasks for the Assembly to performconsistent with its consultative role. I should accordingly like to remind mycolleagues of the request made by my predecessor in CP. (50) 236, paragraph 19 (2),that they should make enquiries in their own Departments as a matter of urgencyto ascertain whether the European aspects of any of the subjects with which theydeal could suitably be handled by the Council of Europe.Recommendation11. I ask my colleagues to agree that, as proposed in paragraph 9 above, theUnited Kingdom Representative should be authorised to put forward an amend-ment to the Statute which will permit the Consultative Assembly to discuss thepolitical aspects of defence, while ensuring that the Committee of Ministers areprecluded from taking decisions on defence questions.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,\6th April, 1951.
