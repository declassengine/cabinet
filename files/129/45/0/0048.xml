Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1951CONFIDENTIAL C*w No. 31CP. (51) 1233rd May, 195.1CABINETBRITISH INTERESTS IN china memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the annexed memorandumon the &quot; Treatment,!of British Interests in China by,the Central People&apos;? Govern-ment.&quot; . It tells a distressing story of the progressive decline of our once flourishinginterests in China!2.. The conclusion reached in paragraph 18 of the memorandum suggeststhat We are. faced in Communist; China with a deliberate policy of squeezing putby degrees those British and Western interests which are not of practical use aridassistance to the Chinese. This, policy, including the gradual exclusion of foreignConsuls, is in many ways similar to that which was applied in Soviet Russia afterthe Revolution..3. Despite this I am convinced that our decision to recognise the central people&apos;s Government of China in January 1950 was right, and the only possiblepolicy Jo. adopt in the chcumstances. Uut I think it is important that we shouldbe fully alive to. the likelihood that, for some time to come at any rate, the chinese communists,niay. continue to;fpflqw^6&apos;.Murse they now appear to have set ttieih-seives and that. this, will mean a continuation of measures against British and other western interests, including the probableelimination of most traces of Westernideas and influence.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W.1,3rd May, 1951.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT
ANNEXTreatment of British Interests in China by Central People&apos;sGovernmentBritish Subjects in china the best guide to Chinese treatment of British interests in China is probablyprovided by the statistics of British subjects (nationals of the United Kingdom and old Commonwealth countries) particularly in Shanghai. Shortly before the Com-munist take-over in May 1949 there were 3,000 in Shanghai; now there are about1,000. The total number of British subjects in China is now about 1,700; this compares with about 20,000 in 1937 and 5,000 in 1945.British Stake in China2. In 1937, the British stake in China was estimated at  200,000,000. Thefigure is now nominal, property often being a liability. British commercial interestscan be divided into two: categories:  (a) the manufacturing and distributing interests;(b) Import and Export firms and shipping interests.Commercial Interests(a) British manufacturing and distributing interests in China3. Firms in this category include the British American Tobacco Company,with cigarette factories as well as agencies throughout China; the Kailan MiningAdministration, the largest coal mining enterprise in China, formerly with 50 percent. British ownership and management; the Asiatic Petroleum Company (Shell),/With its installations and distributing agencies throughout the country dealingmainly in kerosene and gasoline (all the Company&apos;s property except its offices wererequisitioned by the Chinese Government on 29th April &quot;for the sake of China&apos;s security and in the public interest&quot;: it looks as if this were a measure of retaliationfor our requisitioning of the Chinese oil tanker Yung Hao in Hong Kong);Imperial Chemical Industries, selling dyes and fertilisers; British godowns, wharves,warehouses, tugs and lighters in the Yangtse ports; soap factories; wool and eggpacking factories, breweries, &amp;c. A number of these are running at a loss and some are in process of liquidation (e.g., the British American Tobacco Company). Thisalso applies to many of the smaller independent business Units though a few aremaking small profits which, however, cannot be remitted to the United Kingdom.The main causes of this are (i) little or no business;(ii) inability to dismiss labour or reduce labour charges (one reason for this may be Chinese anxieties about resulting large-scale unemployment);(iii) high taxation (though less severe than a year ago);(iv) fixed prices (often below cost of production rates);(v) lack of raw materials;(vi) low purchasing power as a result of the Governments strict deflationarypolicy; and(vii) competition by more favourably placed Chinese companies as well asChinese Government monopolies.4. There has been no specific discrimination since many Chinese enterpriseshave similar difficulties (although they can sometimes obtain government loans orassistance). The technique used by the Chinese has been a rigid- enforcement of regulations which often ignore economic facts. Failure to comply would bringthe manager of the foreign company in question up against the law. On the otherhand attempts to comply have led some companies to insolvency. Closure ofbusiness and reduction of staff are often not permitted. Sale too is made difficult orimpossible. Moreover until such time as &quot; liquidation &quot; difficulties have been over-come by the &quot; responsible &quot; person of the enterprise in question, he is unable toobtain an exit permit. Difficulties experienced by individual British firms are sum-marised in the appendix to this memorandum.
(b) Export and Import Firms,-and Shipping and Insurance Interests . -5. British firms in the export/import business, certain packing firms, as wellas shipping interests have been in a much better position and during 1950 they were making reasonably good profits. Capital and essential goods, trucks, steel rails,rubber, medicines, raw cotton and oil (until July 1950) have been imported in con-siderable quantities into, China and part of the handling of this business was doneby British firms, &apos;&apos;,&apos;&apos;      &apos;vZ&apos;?j &apos;   J&quot;-;-&apos;: W^:&apos; &apos; i -46. While these traders have come up against the competition of ChineseGovernment monopolies, their services are hard to replace; moreover Chinesestockpiling during the last year has in some cases brought them increased business.On the other hand, the American embargo on goods to China and Chinese appre-apprehensions of further economic &quot; sanctions &quot; have resulted in the Chinese Governmentintroducing a strict barter system with insistence on imports actually arriving beforeexports are released. This is now leading to a reduction in business, although its long-term implications for British traders are still hard to assess. All this and the increasing; trade between China and the Soviet bloc, make the.long-term prospects of our traders appear somewhat bleak. .7. Recent figures show that some 40-60 British ships of all types continueto engage in trade with China or between Chinese ports. In some cases these ships are substantially Chinese-owned although under the British flag. Most of theinsurance interest is carried on the British insurance market. British ships have(on several occasions) been shelled by Chinese shore batteries in the approaches to hong Kong. Protests in Peking have so far not elicited any reply. British ships have also encountered delays and administrative difficulties in Chinese ports. Forexample, the Flintshire, which was held for some time in Tsingtao for allegedsmuggling of arms, was only released after her master had signed a &quot; confession.&quot;In addition recent Hong Kong reports state that quite a few British masters are showing marked reluctance to sail to Chinese ports.Consulates8. His Majesty&apos;s Consular officers are not recognised in their official capacity:Except on personal questions they are not permitted to have any dealings with theChinese authorities. They can, therefore, do nothing to protect British subjects intheir districts. Despite this their presence helps to maintain the morale of thecommunity. His Majesty&apos;s Vice-Consul at Mukden was expelled towards the endof last year. His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Tihwa was deported in January 1951:His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Kunming has recently been ordered to vacate theConsulate at ten days&apos; notice. This has compelled us to instruct him to apply foran exit permit. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Nanking was also recently humiliated bythe local authorities who forced him to sign an apology for his intervention on behalfof an Irish nun who had been arrested. At Tsingtao the Consulate Chineseaccountant has been arrested. At Chungking His Majesty&apos;s Vice-Consul?s Chineseservants have been arrested. A short while ago we decided to close, by May 1951,our Consular posts at Chungking, Kunming, Nanking, Hankow, Amoy and Tsingtaobecause the Chinese would not give visas for any replacements of Consular staff and British subjects and interests in these districts had been greatly reduced.Missionaries*9. Almost all Protestant missions in China, British and American, have now taken the decision in principle to withdraw and are in fact getting their membersout as fast as possible. Directives from Peking to provincial authorities pointing out that all foreign missionaries are tainted with &quot; imperialism &quot; and potential spiesrequiring careful watching were issued in the autumn of last year. Since then anumber have been arrested and some subsequently released. At the present time,some thirty or so are in gaol (almost all of them being American and Canadian)which is probably more than at any time since the anti-foreigner period of theBoxer Rebellion (1900). There have been several cases of public trials, confessions,&amp;c. Charges are frequently not proferred. Access to persons so arrested is normallydenied. A typical case is that of Dr. Stewart Allen, in charge of the CanadianMission Hospital at Chungking (formerly our Embassy Doctor), a devoted and.highly competent medical; man and highly respected by the Chinese.   He was* This section refers also to Commonwealth and American missionaries.
arrested in December, accused of a &quot; reactionary &quot;. attitude. The Chinese pressreported inter alia that he had poisoned progressive minded patients. A number ofmissionary schools, universities, and hospitals have been taken over.Press &apos; -&apos;&apos;    &apos; &apos;10. When the Communists came into power, Reuters and other foreign newsagencies were immediately stopped. They were told to apply for registration, butapplications were not considered, pending the establishment of diplomatic relations.British and other foreign journalists were similarly not permitted to receive or sendmessages. Over the last two years, no British,or foreign journalist (other thanCommunist) has been able to obtain an entry permit into China. The North ChinaNews (British newspaper in Shanghai) has just been compelled to throw in its handafter 100 years of publication.Travel Restrictions11. Exit and Entry Permits-There have been considerable difficulties. Entrypermits are normally only given to certain business staff replacements and involvelong delays. Exit permits present particular trouble for the heads of firms. TTieyare not granted if there are financial or labour difficulties outstanding. Out. of 25applications for visas for British Consular and Embassy officials during the last sixmonths only three have been granted.Police12. Most foreigners are now visited by the police in their houses once a fortnight or so. Servants are periodically questioned and routine check-ups onactivities, visitors and habits are made. The police normally behave quitecourteously. Most foreigners in Shanghai and the larger ports have beenunmolested.*Censorship13. All foreign mail is subject to unofficial censorship, but the mail does get through fairly expeditiously.British Property14. It is not possible to register any British property in China. Registrationforms have been completed and receipts issued in lieu of former title deeds but inno case have new title deeds been issued. The reason given is that &quot; diplomatic relations have not yet been established.&quot; With one or two exceptions, it has notbeen possible to sell property in China; in fact property in China more often thannot is a liability rather than an asset. The Chinese have requisitioned without compensation the British Military Compound (part of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy) in peking and His Majesty&apos;s Consulates at Amoy and Foochow.15. Foreign clubs and hospitals have in certain cases been taken over on an arbitrary basis by the Chinese. This applies to the clubs of Canton, Tsingtao andPeking; also to the International Hospital at Shanghai.Chinese State Obligations16. The Chinese Government, in marked contrast to its claims to State assetsabroad, has so far failed to meet State obligations. For example, the Chinese have failed to meet payments due on Chinese Government Sterling bonds and ignoredall communications from the Bank of England as well as from His Majesty&apos;charge d&apos;Affaires. 1Sino-British Treaty (1943) on Relinquishment of Extra-Territorial Rights17. The provisions of this Treaty, which are on a basis of reciprocity, furnish the basis of our rights as far as travel, residence and the conduct of business inChina are concerned. Many of these provisions have been ignored. It is doubtfulwhether the Chinese Government recognise the validity of the Treaty.   The basic
5 31principle in the &quot; Common Programme of the Chinese People&apos;s Political consultative council&quot; (published in October 1949) on treaties reads as follows:  &quot; The Central People&apos;s Government of the People&apos;s Republic of China shallexamine the treaties and agreements concluded between the Kuomintang andforeign Governments and recognise or abrogate, revise and renew themaccording to their respective contents.&quot;Conclusion18. All this suggests a deliberate and consistent policy of squeezing out bydegrees those British and, indeed, Western interests which are not of practical use and assistance to the Chinese. *Foreign Office,May, 1951.ANNEX AKailan Mining AdministrationAll the Kailan Mining Administration foreign staff (administrative andtechnical) have now left China. Such claims for compensation as exist will almost certainly have to be written off.British American Tobacco company the British American Tobacco Company have succeeded in getting out mostof their foreign staff. In Tsingtao, however, they have so far not been able to persuade the Chinese to take over an almost brand new factory in exchange forexit permits for five of their foreign staff. The Company&apos;s stocks and assets in shanghai are almost exhausted and they are worried about the staff position. the firm&apos;s general policy is to get out foreign staff, to write off all assets in China andnot to remit any fresh funds from the United Kingdom.Asiatic Petroleum Company (Shell)Shell installations and stocks (oil and kerosene) which, since the oil embargoto China in 1950, have been under the virtual control of the authorities, wererequisitioned on 29th April.Godowns and Floating Property of Butterfield and Swire, International ExportCompany and OthersAll godowns and floating properties of British firms and also of some Chinesefirms in both Nanking and Hankow have been requisitioned. This was done with-out prior warning. No compensation is expected. Firms may, in some cases, even be relieved at this development, provided the requisitioning authorities take over their labour and staff commitments.Shanghai and Hongkew Wharf CompanyThis Company is a Jardines&apos; interest and its affairs probably provide a classicexample for firms in this category. With assets valued at about  200,000 at thetime of Shanghai takeover in 1949, the Company is now insolvent. With verylittle shipping reaching Shanghai, they have virtually had no income. They cannotsell their property. Staff reduction is not permitted; loans against their propertycannot be obtained from Chinese banks. Mr. Lennox, the Shanghai Manager ofJardines, is &quot; responsible &quot; for this Company. He now faces the risk of imprison-ment because of failure to meet wage bills based on an arbitration decision whichignores the fact that the Company is insolvent. For a short while Mr. Lennoxwas held in custody. He was released when further funds were temporarily raised.But this process obviously cannot go on indefinitely. The Chinese undoubtedlycalculate that even if this Company cannot pay, Jardines, who have the maininterest in it, can.
