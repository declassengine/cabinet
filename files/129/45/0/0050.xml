(si) 125 ?&apos;f&apos;;&apos;&apos;!S:firI ^5f/* May, 1951CABINETPREPARATION OF LEGISLATION FOR THE 1951-52 session memorandum by the Home Secretary1. The Committee on Future Legislation have considered, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned and with Parliamentary Counsel, what preparatory workon legislation for the 1951-52 session should now be put in hand, subject to prior approval of policy in each case by the Cabinet or an appropriate Cabinet Committee.This is without prejudice to the decisions which the Cabinet may take later in theyear about the final content of The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.For present purposes, we have assumed that the Session will run from the autumn of1951 until the summer of 1952.2. It is normally the custom for the Committee^ proposals to the Cabinet tocover only major and medium-sized Bills. Last year, however^ in view of theParliamentary situation, we felt that the Cabinet would wish to^examine as a whole the provisional legislative programme for the new Session. We suggest that theCabinet should follow the same course this year. The Annex accordingly covers allthe Bills which have been proposed.3. We recommend that the provisional programme of Bills for the 1951-52Session should include the following:  (a) Bills to be ready for introduction in October 1951:  (i) Major Bills Naval Discipline. ,Beet Sugar Industry.Foreign Visiting Forces.Local Government (Public Order) (Scotland).(ii) Medium-sized Bills-Mortgaging of Aircraft.Food and Drugs.Dental.Geneva Conventions oh the Victims of War.Cinematograph.National Insurance (Industrial Injuries).Ferries.Preservation of Historic Buildings.Preservation of Historic Buildings (Scotland).(iii) Minor Bills Prevention of Damage by Pests.Convention on the International Recognition of Rights in Aircraft.Diplomatic Privileges.Fireworks.Valuation and Local Government (Scotland).Currency and Bank Notes.C&amp;) Bills to be ready for introduction before Christmas 1951:  (i) Medium-sized Bills Agricultural Safety.Children (Employment).Civil Defence (Industry).Housing.40559 b
(ii) Minor Bills- ...&apos; Civil Defence (Grants).     :y:-  &apos;,,...........      Civil Defence (Mobile Columns).Whaling Industry (Scotland).National Museum of Antiques (Scotland).Geneva Convention on Road Traffic;Road Traffic.Highways.Notes on these Bills are given in the^ Annex. &quot;4.  We would draw the attention of the Cabinet-to; the following points:  (a) Existing emergency legislation is due to expire on 10th December, 1951,and a further year&apos;s renewal will be necessary by that date, involvingAddresses in both Houses of Parliament. A few Defence regulations will be replaced by certain of the.Bills which have been suggested.: (b) We have added the House of Commons Disqualification Bill to the provi-sional programme because it cannot get beyond formal introductionand First Reading during the current Session. We have also added the following Bills for which time is not likely to be available duringthe 1950-51 Session:-Beet Sugar Industry.Northern Ireland Fisheries..,, Local Authorities Loans.(c) We assume that the Full Employment Bill (CM. (51), 14th Conclusions,Minute 8) will not be proceeded with for the present.(d) Time for Private Members&apos; Bills will no doubt be provided during 1951-52and at the end of the Annex two Bills are mentioned which might be suitable for introduction by Private Members. We shall need a bettersupply for. issue to Government supporters who may succeed in the ballot and ask for suitable Bills. It may be that some of the Billslisted in Groups IV and VI of the provisional programme would be appropriate for this purpose.5.  Lastly, the Committee wish to stress the following points connected withthe preparation of legislation for the 195.1-52 Session:  (i) We must provide for having a substantial number of Bills ready for introduction as soon as the new Session begins. The bulk of the bills in the programme should be ready before Christmas if we are to avoid the sort of situation which arose last autumn when the House on several occasions adjourned early through shortage of Bills, although therewas a substantial programme of legislation for the Session.(ii) Too heavy a burden of legislation should not be placed on any one department.(iii) The approval of this memorandum by the Cabinet does not authoriseany Minister to anticipate The Krng&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament by promising that a Bill mentioned in the annexed listwill be introduced next Session.6.  To sum up, the Cabinet are invited:  (1) To agree that,&apos;pending the formulation of a final legislative programme.    for the 1951-52 Session, Parliamentary Counsel should proceed with the*f &apos; preparation of the Bills listed in jthe Annex, subject to prior policy11 approval being secured in each case. - &apos;   , V   &apos;&apos;(2) To authorise the Committee on Future Legislation to review from time totime, the progress made with the preparation of legislation for the&apos; jpSl^SZ^essiptiandlo make suchminor amendments in the provisionalprograrrime is ,may seem desirable.&apos; &apos; -     -J.
