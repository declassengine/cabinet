THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENT.&quot;/Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1951SECRET Copy No.    31CP. (51) 13723rd May, 1951CABINETJAPANESE PEACE treaty memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsBackgroundOn 23rd April (CM. (51) 30th Conclusions, Minute 4) the Cabinet authorisedme to arrange for preliminary discussions to be held with the United States Govern-ment regarding a Japanese Peace Treaty, and agreed that, subject to certain modifications, the proposals in my memorandum of 16th April (CP. (51) 104) couldbe adopted as guidance for our representatives in these preliminary discussions.The Talks in Washington2. The talks with United States officials were accordingly held in Washingtonfrom 25th April until 4th May, and their results were briefly as follows.3. On the contents of the Treaty, our representatives, acting on instructions,reserved the United Kingdom position on the following points: the disposal of formosa; Japanese claims in the Antarctic; the future status of the Ryukyu andBonin Islands; war criminals; fisheries; the initial date for purposes of certain ofthe property clauses in the Treaty (the United States wish to take the date of PearlHarbour as a starting point, while we have technical reasons for wishing to start insome cases from the date of the outbreak of war with Germany); Allied property in Japan; Japanese gold, and assets in neutral and ex-enemy countries; the wording of the clause about general economic relations (although the Americans had in factcome some way to meet us on this); the civil aviation clause; and the disputes clause.4. The United States representatives accepted the substance (though notnecessarily the form) of our views on the following points: the end of the occupa-tion; the renunciation by Japan of her rights in renounced territories; the renunciation of her rights under certain international agreements (with United States reservations about the Congo Basin Treaties and the Bank for International Settlements, onwhich they have promised us an early expression of their views); Japanese debts;pre-war claims against Japan; renunciation of claims by Japan against Germany;German property in Japan; industrial, literary and artistic property; insurance, con-tracts, prescriptions and negotiable instruments; prize courts and judgments. TheUnited States representatives also accepted our view about the multilateral agree-ments and conventions to which Japan should adhere or continue to adhere, butpreferred that this should be dealt with in a separate protocol attached to the Treatycontaining a voluntary declaration to the desired effect by the Japanese Government.The Americans also accepted our provision about War Graves, but would like thistoo to take the form of a separate voluntary declaration by Japan. There seemsto be no objection to the United States proposal on either of these questions.5. Apart from these points, our representatives reached agreement with theUnited States in substance on various questions (specified in paragraph 5 of CP.(51) 104) where they had authority to meet the view of the United States Govern-ment, including, in particular, the omission of the war guilt clause which hadfigured in the previous United Kingdom draft. As regards the limitation of Japan&apos;sshipbuilding capacity, about which we had previously reserved our position whileagreeing to its omission from the draft Treaty, the United States Government40616 b
expressed general agreement with our view that Japan should be induced voluntarilyto limit her shipbuilding capacity, and they are how considering how effect can best be given to this.6. The talks thus narrowed, but did not eliminate the area of disagreementon the substance of the Treaty. They resulted in a tentative and partially agreeddraft in which all the necessary reservations by both sides were noted down. Acopy of this draft is attached at Annex A. The United Kingdom and United Statescontributions to this draft are side-lined in the left and right-hand margins respec-tively; as will be seen, they are fairly evenly balanced, and in length the document is somewhere between the original United Kingdom and United States drafts.(Passages which are not side-lined are those which either were common to bothsides, or emerged as a result of the discussion.) The representatives on both sidesmade it clear that the results of the talks were subject to approval by their respective governments.7. As regards procedure, our representatives had a talk with Mr. Dulles, who took note of the proposals approved by the Cabinet (Annex C of CP. (51) 104) and expressed general agreement, though he said he would like to think certain pointsover further.8. Mr. Dulles also raised the problem of Chinese participation and the dis-posal of Formosa. He seemed to realise the force of our case against the inclusionof the Chinese nationalists in the peace settlement, and took due note of the point that, in order to prevent this, I might, without commitment, even be prepared torecommend to my colleagues that neither of the two Chinese Governments should sign the Treaty, leaving open the question of their accession later. Mr. Dulles saidthat as soon as the present emotional state of congressional opinion allowed, hewould start exploring the possibility of a solution on these lines. (We know confi-dentially from Mr. Allison that in fact Mr. Dulles and the State Department are both attracted by the idea of a compromise solution on the lines suggested by theCanadian Government (see paragraph 19 below). Mr. Dulles agreed that theFormosa clause should present no difficulties once the Chinese problem had beensolved.9. The general effect of the talks seems to have been to clear up the atmosphere and dispel certain suspicions which were beginning to form on theUnited States side to the effect that, despite our protestations to the contrary, we might in fact be trying either to delay the Peace Treaty or to give it a restrictiveand illiberal character. The talks seem to have convinced the United StatesGovernment that in this important Far Eastern matter it was possible for Britishand Americans to work together as a team.The Next Stage10. After consultation among the Departments concerned at the official level,I now recommend that the draft of the Treaty (Annex A) should be generally approved, subject to the clearing up of certain drafting and other minor points,which is already in hand. Among the points still outstanding those which raise questions of policy are further discussed in Annex B. On these questions I invitemy colleagues to agree that:  (a) We should accept the United States proposal that the United States shouldcontinue to administer the Ryukyu Islands south of 290 North latitude,ithe Bonin Islands, including Rosario Island, the Volcano Islands, PareceVela and the Marcus Islands, pending the making of any proposal bythe United States to the United Nations to place these islands under its trusteeship system; and that the Treaty should not provide for japan to renounce her sovereignty over these islands.(b) As further discussion in Washington has failed to move the United StatesGovernment from their attitude on this point, we should no longer seek to insist that stocks of Japanese gold should be made available as reparations. (It has not been found possible to reach agreement on thisrecommendation with the Treasury at the official level.)(c) We should not accept the United States contention that Japan should beallowed, by the absence of any provision to the contrary in the Treaty,to retain the ownership of her assets in neutral countries, unless Japanwere obliged to pay the Allies a sum of about $20 million to cover their value, Out of which His Majesty&apos;s Government would expect to receive
immediately the value, of the Swiss francs held by Japan in Switzerlandin respect of payment for the relief of prisoners of war.(d) If the United States persist in their view that the disputes clause of theTreaty should not make any provision for claims disputes arising out ofof the Treaty to be settled by a special neutral tribunal, we should not press our contrary view further, since the formula in article 21 of thedraft at Annex A would in fact not rule out the reference of claimsdisputes to a neutral tribunal by agreement between the State oon-cerned and Japan.(It is possible that the further clarification of the United States attitude whichis still proceeding may reveal further points which will have to be sufo-mittedto the Cabinet subsequently for decision, e.g., on the Congo BasinTreaties or an allied property in Japan.)The decisions of the Cabinet on these&apos;points will be included in a brief for the guidance of our representatives in the next round of informal discussions with theUnited States Government, which will be held when Mr. Dulles comes to london on 2nd June. It is hoped that these talks may resolve the outstanding points of difference.11. In the discussion on procedure referred to in paragraph 7 above, Mr.Dulles reverted to his earlier suggestion about the desirability of circulating a jointUnited Kingdom-United States draft to all the other Governments concerned. Inso doing he made it clear that he could not commit the United States Governmentto the suggestion. He seemed favourably disposed towards it himself, however, andit may be thought that in order to be prepared for any official United States pro-posal in this sense, His Majesty&apos;s Government on their side should consider itsdesirability.  The following considerations arise: (a) Any draft which may be agreed with Mr. Dulles would in fact be a jointUnited Kingdom-United States effort. This being so, there seems to beno reason why we should hide our fight under a bushel or try to con-cealthe very considerable influence which we have had on the shape of the peace settlement as it is beginning to emerge.(b) Our association with the United States as one of the two principal draftingPowers would be good for our credit in all parts of the world, particu-larly in the Pacific and Far East, where it would help to correct anymisunderstandings which may be current about our non-participation inthe Pacific Defence Pact.(c) Given the number of difficult questions at issue between ourselves and theUnited States at this moment, particularly on Far Eastern questions, itmay be thought that it would be useful in both countries to advertisethe fact that here is one important Far Eastern matter on which both countries have been able to co-operate on an equal and harmoniousbasis.(d) If the objection is raised that our association in a joint draft with theUnited States suggests that we are hanging on the Americans&apos; coat-tails,the answer can be made that in any case the fact of our consultations with the Americans on the subject is known, and that if any resultingdocument was not a joint one this would savour far more of Americanpredominance than a joint draft would.(e) It may also be objected that the Japanese Government, who haveunofficially been shown the previous United States draft, would find thenew draft less satisfactory to themselves and, if it was a joint one, wouldblame us for this, so that our future relations with them would suffer.This is clearly not a consideration which should deflect us from ourcourse, and in any case the Japanese would be able to guess that the differences between the United States draft and any new one, even ifnot circulated as a joint one, were in fact due to our influence.(f) It must be recognised that, in sponsoring such a draft, the United KingdomGovernment may, on certain issues, be committing themselves publiclyto policies which will be opposed by some Commonwealth Governments.For example, the Government of Australia may not agree to the pro-posal regarding Japanese gold in Annex B. The Government of Indiamay not agree with our views on procedure (Article 13). It is, however,inevitable that, at some stage, we must face these issues, and the presentwould seem to be a suitable stage. We have, of course, been in close40616 b 2
consultation with Commonwealth Governments throughout, and they know our.present position fully. We shall also keep them closelyinformed of the progress of the forthcoming talks with Mr. Dulles inLondon.12. In view of these arguments, I recommend that we should endeavour toarrange that any agreed draft which may emerge from further discussions withthe United States should be circulated to the other Governments concerned as ajoint document on behalf of both our Governments.13. As regards the programme of work on the basis of the proposals approvedby the Cabinet on 23rd April (CP. (51) 104, paragraph 8), I recommend that thenext steps.should be as follows:  (a) Talks with Mr. Dulles in London in the first week of June, aimed ateliminating the outstanding points of difference and producing a draftwith which we can both agree.(b) Circulation of this document (if possible as a joint United Kingdom-United States draft) to all the countries at war with Japan (as regardsthe special position of China please see paragraphs 18-20 below) withan explanation that it has been drafted after consultations with theprincipal Parties to the Peace Settlement, and with a request forcomments within a month.(c) Discussions, probably in Washington on drafting the final text.(d) Reference back to Governments for approval.(e) Signature of the Treaty, possibly in Washington, though this has not been settled.(/) Ratification.14. As regards publicity, Mr. Dulles has suggested that two or three days after the draft Treaty has been communicated to all the Governments concerned as at (b) in paragraph 13 above, its text should be officially released in order to forestall leakages. I agree with this proposal. I also recommend that, shortly before or simultaneously with the release of the text, a full statement should bemade in Parliament explaining the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government on thosepoints in the Treaty which are of most concern to public opinion in the UnitedKingdom. In advance of this, it may also be considered desirable to make a short statement regarding the talks in Washington and the visit of Mr. Dulles at thefirst opportunity after Parliament reassembles.15. As regards consultation with Commonwealth and other interested governments, the Commonwealth representatives in Washington were kept fully informed of the progress and result of the talks. *16. I recommend that Commonwealth Governments should be informed atonce of the instructions which we propose to give to our representatives at the talks with Mr. Dulles, and that their representatives in London should be keptfully informed regarding the progress of the talks. I also consider that it wouldbe desirable that the United States Government (and His Majesty&apos;s government if associated with them on a joint basis), in circulating any draft which may beagreed on in the talks with Mr. Dulles, should explain that this document is theresult of consultation with all the principal parties to the Treaty, which, in fact,includes all the Commonwealth countries (except South Africa) as well as Franceand the Netherlands.17. The French and Netherlands Governments are being informed in general terms of the results of the talks in Washington and I recommend that we should similarly inform them of the results of the talks with Mr. Dulles.Chinese Participation18. My colleagues will recall that they decided on 22nd March that theUnited States Government should be informed that in the view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment the Central People&apos;s Government of China should be invited to partici-pate in any negotiations for the conclusion of a Peace Treaty with Japan; theCabinet felt that an unequivocal communication in this sense should be made to theUnited States Government, and that at that stage it would be undesirable for usto engage in hypothetical discussions with the United States Government regardingthe possibility of a compromise solution (CM. (51) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 3),His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington made representations to the United States
Government accordingly on 30th March and on - 12th April he received an aide-memoire in reply stating that the United States Government did not see how,in so far as it was concerned, the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government could be implemented. The matter was considered further by the Cabinet on 23rd April(CM. (51) 30th Conclusions, Minute 4) and in the sense of that discussion Iinstructed our representatives at the talks in Washington to explore the matter further with the State Department, and if it appeared that there was a serious risk of theassociation of the Chinese Nationalists with the Treaty, to discuss on an informaland non-committal basis the possibility of a compromise solution on the lines ofthat outlined in the next paragraph. As will be seen from paragraph 8 above,Mr. Dulles&apos;s reactions in the tentative discussion of this problem with our repre-sentatives were not altogether discouraging.19-. By way of a compromise the Canadian Government have made thefollowing proposal to the United States Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government.They consider that the lack of unanimity among the Governments most concerned inthe Japanese Peace Treaty on the question of the proper Chinese signatory poses a major problem, and they are also concerned with the effect of this problem on thefuture relationship between Japan and China; they feel that it might be undesirablefrom the point of view of future stability in the area that Japan be bound to acceptthe signature of any Chinese Government, upon which the opinion of the AlliedPowers is divided, to a Treaty with such important implications for itself and China.The Canadian Government agree that an early Peace Treaty with Japan is desirable.For this reason, and because of the difficulties already mentioned, they suggest thatwhile provision be made in the Treaty for signature on behalf of China, the signaturebe delayed for the present. An accession clause could be included in the Treatyunder which China might later accede.20. This proposal seems to me to have much to recommend it and I considerthat it deserves serious study. I suggest to my colleagues that, having put our iews about the desirability of an approach to the Central People&apos;s Government of Chinaon record, and having, as they will recall, received a negative response from theUnited States Government, the next stage should be to consider the question on animmediate working basis, and that from this point of view the most important object is not to bring the Central People&apos;s Government into the peace settlement, which infact would almost certainly be impossible owing to their own attitude, as well as tothe attitude of the United States, but to prevent the United States from insisting onChinese nationalist participation, which up to now has appeared only too likely. i therefore recommend that in the talks with Mr. Dulles our representative should beauthorised to explore the situation further, and if it appears that the United StatesGovernment may be willing to leave the nationalists out of the peace settlement,that on that understanding we should no longer insist on the participation of theCentral People&apos;s Government, but that there should be an accession clause providingfor China to accede to the Treaty when certain specific conditions, requiring a more general measure of agreement among the other signatories on Chinese and far eastern questions generally, have been fulfilled.Formosa21. As regards Formosa, the wording of the relevant clause will depend on thesolution of the problem about Chinese participation. It will be recalled that hithertowe have maintained that the Treaty should state that Japan cedes Formosa to China,while the United States Government have contended that the Treaty should simplysever Japan&apos;s connexion with Formosa without specifying what should become ofit. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the Americans were to insist on theChinese nationalists participating in the Treaty, it would then clearly be undesirable for Japan in the Treaty to cede Formosa to China, for although in law the cessionwould be to China as a State, the practical effect would be to legalise Chiang KaiShek&apos;s hold on Formosa. Consequently, if it appeared that there was a serious likelihood-hood of the Chinese nationalists being associated with the Treaty, it may be thoughtthat we should reconsider our previous view and agree with the United States thatthe Treaty should provide only for Japan&apos;s renunciation of her sovereignty overFormosa, without any mention of cession to China. If, however, the nationalistsare not allowed to participate in the Treaty, then it may be thought that we should maintain our view that the Treaty should provide not only for renunciation by Japanbut for cession to China, with some appropriate suspensory provision which in
effect reserved the position of the signatories on the interpretation of this clause.The fact is that, as regards policy, we and the Americans are agreed that a decisionon Formosa must be delayed pending some form of Far Eastern settlement, and thatas long as China is obstructing the fulfilment of the Cairo Declaration in respect of korea,, she cannot expect to receive any benefits Under the Cairo Declaration inrespect of Formosa. It should be possible, given agreement on Chinese partici-pation, to find a formula which would fit this agreed policy on Formosa into the framework of the Treaty.22.  I invite my colleagues to agree to the proposals set out above.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,23rd May, 1951.

Article 16Within six months [one year] from the coming into force of the present TreatyJapan will, upon demand, return the property, tangible and intangible, and all rightsor interests of any kind, in Japan of each Allied Power and its nationals (includingjuridical persons) within Japan between 7th December, 1941, and 2nd September,1945, unless the owner has freely disposed thereof without duress or fraud. In thecase of loss or damage to property of nationals (including juridical persons) of AlliedPowers in Japan compensation will be made in accordance with Japanese domesticlegislation in yen subject to Japanese foreign exchange regulations.(Note. This Article is dependent on the nature of the legislation to be passed by Japan. In the meantime the United Kingdom maintains Articles 24and 26 of the United Kingdom draft, and also reserves on the drafting of thepresent Article. The United States is preparing a draft on patents and trade-marks, and the United Kingdom on literary and artistic property and insurancedeposits and reserves, for inclusion in the present Chapter.)(Note. A stipulation regarding immunity from taxes, levies or other charges along the lines of paragraphs 4(c) and 6 of Article 26 of the UnitedKingdom draft may have to be included if satisfactory provision on this point is not included in the Japanese domestic legislation.)Article 17(a) Upon the request of any of the Allied Powers, the Japanese government shall review and revise in conformity with international law any decision or orderof the Japanese Prize Courts in cases involving ownership rights of nationals (includ-ing juridical persons) of that Allied Power and shall supply copies of all documentscomprising the records of these cases, including the decisions taken and ordersissued. In any case in which such review or revision shows that restoration is due,the provisions of Article 16 shall apply to the property concerned.(b) The Japanese Government shall take the necessary measures to enablenationals (including juridical persons) of any of the Allied Powers at any time within one year from the coming into force of the present Treaty to submit to the appropriate-ate Japanese authorities for review any judgment given by a Japanese court between7th December, 1941, and the coming into force of the present Treaty in any pro-ceedings in which any such national was unable to make adequate presentation ofhis case either as plaintiff or defendant- The Japanese Government shall provide that, where the national has suffered injury by reason of any such judgment, he shall be restored in the position in which he was before the judgment was given or shall be afforded such relief as may be just and equitable in the circumstances.(Note. A reference to paragraph (a) should be included in paragraph 1of Article 35 of the United Kingdom draft to provide for settlement of any dispute as to the rule of international law to be applied.)Article 18(a) Japan recognises that the intervention of the former state of war does not affect the obligation of the Japanese Government or of Japanese nationals (includ-ing juridical persons) to pay debts and perform other contractual obligations,including those in respect of bonds, or to consider on then merits claims for loss or damage to property, or for personal injury or death, which arose before theexistence of a state of war and which may be due to or may be presented by theGovernment or nationals (including juridical persons) of an Allied Power.(b) Japan affirms its liability for the pre-war external debt of the JapaneseState and for debts of corporate bodies subsequently declared to be liabilities of theJapanese State and expresses its intention to enter on negotiations at an early date with its creditors with respect to the resumption of payments on those debts; agrees to facilitate negotiations in respect of private pre-war claims and obligations; andagrees to facilitate the transfer of sums as to which liability has been recognised or may be established.(Note. Problem of Japanese liability for debts in respect of properties inrenounced or ceded territories remains to be considered.)
Chapter VI. Settlement of DisputesArticle 21If in the opinion of any Party to the present Treaty there has arisen a disputeconcerning the interpretation or execution of the Treaty, which is not settled byother agreed means, the dispute shall, at the request of any party thereto, be referred for decision to the International Court of Justice. Japan and those Allied powers which are not already parties to the Statute of the International Court of Justice willdeposit with the Registrar of the Court, at the time of their respective ratifications ofthe present Treaty, and in conformity with the resolution of the United NationsSecurity Council, dated 15th October, 1946, a general declaration accepting thejurisdiction, without special agreement, of the Court generally in respect of alldisputes of the character referred to in this Article.(Note. United Kingdom reserves paragraph 1 of Article 35 of the UnitedKingdom draft.)Chapter VII.

The composition of the list in paragraph 2 is subject to further con-sideration. The United Kingdom may raise a point in connection with paragraph 1on industrial, literary and artistic property.)
ANNEX BOutstanding Points on the Text of the treaty the Ryukyu, Bonin and other islands1. It was stated.in the Cairo Declaration of 1943 and the Potsdam Proclama-tion of July 1945, that Japanese sovereignty should be confined to the four mainislands and to a number of adjacent minor islands to be defined in the Treaty. on 2nd January, 1951, the Cabinet approved a proposal (CP. (50) 323, paragraph 8 (b)(ii)) that the Ryukyu and Bonin Islands should be placed under a United Statestrusteeship. A provision to the following effect was accordingly included inarticle 5 of the United Kingdom draft treaty:&quot;Article 5(1) Japan renounces sovereignty over, and all right, title and interest in theRyukyu, Bonin and Volcano Islands, and Marcus Island.(2) Japan takes note of the intention of the United States Government to nego-tiate a United Nations trusteeship agreement in respect of the Ryukyuand Bonin Islands when this present treaty has come into force.&quot;2.   In the talks between officials in Washington, the United States representa-tives put forward a fresh draft article about the future of the Ryukyu, &amp;c, islands,which runs as follows:  :&quot; Japan will concur in any proposal of the United Nations to place under its trusteeship system, with the United States as the administering authority,the Ryukyu Islands south of 29Q north latitude, the Bonin Islands, includingRosario Island, the Volcano Islands, Parece Vela and Marcus Island. Pendingthe making of such a proposal and affirmative action thereon, the United states will have the right to exercise all and any powers of administration, legislation,and jurisdiction over the territory and inhabitants of these islands, including, their territorial waters.&quot;After consulting the Foreign Office by telegraph, the United Kingdom representa-tives reserved their position on this point.3.   As will be seen, the United States article proposes:-(1) that Japan should retain sovereignty over the islands in question;(2) that the islands continue under United States administration;(3) that the United States may try to obtain trusteeship over the islands.(It is in fact doubtful whether the United States could securetrusteeship over islands which remained under Japanese sovereignty.)The United States representatives explained the intention behind this article asfollows. They do not wish the Ryukyus and other islands concerned to be removed by the Treaty from Japan&apos;s sovereignty since possible future changes in militarytechnique may turn the islands into a liability instead of an asset from the UnitedStates point of view; and this being so, the United States Government think itdesirable to mitigate the political effect in Japan of the territorial provisions of theTreaty by not insisting on a renunciation of Japanese sovereignty over the islands inquestion. The United States.Government have, however, every intention of retain-ing the administration of the islands for as long as can at present be foreseen.4. Our view is that this proposed arrangement might create serious legal difficulties and complications between the United States and Japan. It would,therefore, appear preferable on general grounds to adhere to the policy previouslyendorsed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, namely, that in the Treaty Japan shouldrenounce sovereignty over the Ryukyu, Bonin, &amp;c, Islands and if possible, agree-ment should be recorded that they should be placed under United States trusteeship.This view was put to the United States representatives during the talks in washington, but with no effect.5. It appears difficult for us to insist further with the United States aboutwhere we feel their own advantage lies in a matter of relatively small direct concern to ourselves, and it is, therefore, recommended that we should now accept theUnited States proposal.
The Japanese&apos;Gold6. It will be recalled that, when the subject was discussed by the Cabinet on23rd April (CM. (51) 30th Conclusion, Minute 4, and paragraph 5 (i) of CP. (51)104), the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was not in favour of abandoningat the outset our claim to a.share in the stocks of Japanese gold; we might have toagree to this in the end, but our representatives should not concede it withoutargument. This view was endorsed by the Cabinet. Our representatives in washington put our ease as strongly-as possible to the Americans, but were unableto move them, and it will be seen that they therefore reserved this point on behalfof His Majesty&apos;s Government. (Please see note at end of article .15 of the draftat Annex A, referring to article 23 of the United Kingdom draft.) The UnitedStates representatives on their side explained that the gold, which is worth about$200 million, while it would be of no appreciable use in meeting the claims of all.the belligerent countries against Japan (altogether apart from the practical problemof its distribution) would be of great and immediate value to Japan in bolsteringup. her external financial position.7. As will be remembered, the United States Government had previouslystated in their aide-memoire of 14th March that they must insist that, shouldJapanese gold be made available as reparations, the whole of it should be made over to the United States as a part repayment of the $2,000 million aid given to japan in the last five years.8. There are, therefore, two questions for consideration: first, whether or notthe stocks of gold and precious metals under the control of. the Supreme commander in Japan should be made available as reparations; and, secondly, if they are to bemade available, whether His Majesty&apos;s Government can succeed in securing a shareof them.9. To deal with the second point first, it now seems clear that, if the goldwere made available as reparations, it would be impossible, in view of the attitudeof Congress, for His Majesty&apos;s Government to resist the United States claim toreceive it all as a very small set-off against the aid she had given to Japan duringthe last-fiveyears.10. If, therefore, as seems certain, His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot hope tosecure a share of Japanese gold, the question remains whether the Japanese shouldbe allowed.to retain it. Morally, there are strong arguments for requiring theJapanese to make this small if inadequate reparation for the great damage theycaused in Asia during the war. It will be recalled that the Government ofAustralia has been insistent that Japan should be made to pay some reparations.On the other hand, it is also clear that the United States Government are determined that this gold should remain in Japan, and it would therefore seem unwise for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to court unpopularity in Japan by insisting that, even though they themselves would not receive a share of it, Japan must, nevertheless, be deprived of it.11. It is evident that, in spite of the forceful and repeated exposition of ourview in the course of the talks in Washington, the United States Government arenot going to be moved from, their position on this point. In the circumstances itis recommended that, in the talks with Mr. Dulles, our representatives should beauthorised to agree with the United States view that the matter should not be mentioned in the Treaty, which would have the effect of returning the gold andprecious metals concerned to the Japanese Government when the Treaty comes intoeffect.*Japanese Assets in Neutral Countries12. On 2nd January, Ministers approved CP. (50) 323 which contained a pro-posal (paragraph 8 (d) 2) that &quot; Japanese overseas assets (both official and private)should in no circumstances be returned to Japan or to their Japanese owners ....Japanese assets in neutral countries .... are in most cases under the joint controlof the representatives of China, the U.S.S.R., the United States and the UnitedKingdom, on behalf of the Far Eastern Commission. However, the only practicalway of making those assets available at all would be to propose that they shouldbe liquidated and divided amongst those of the four controlling Powers for* Note. It has not been possible to secure agreement with the Treasury at the official levelon this recommendation.40616 d
Japanese official assets represented in those countries.&quot; (CM. (51) 1st Conclusion,Minute 3.) This proposal became article 28 of the United Kingdom draft peace treaty (CP. (31) 104, Annex A).13. This article was discussed on 27th April at Washington. The UnitedStates Representatives considered it impractical for the following reasons: (a) The sum involved amounted to about 20 million dollars in six neutral countries and Siam. (In round figures, the amount is probably slightlyunder  7 million).(b) The liquidation of these assets might be disproportionately expensive, whichwould leave only a small sum for division amongst the major treaty-making Powers.(c) The division amongst the Allied Powers would give rise to prolongedargument (the Far Eastern Commission after two and a half years ofdiscussion had failed to reach agreement on reparation shares.)The United States Representatives were sympathetic towards His Majesty&apos;s Govern-menfs claim for restitution of about  300,000 worth of Swiss francs from these assets, which represent payments made by them to the Japanese Government duringthe war for the relief of civilians and prisoners of war in Japanese hands. TheUnited States Representatives suggested, however, that this question might besettled by a separate bilateral Anglo-Japanese arrangement.14. The United States Representatives remained unwilling to accept thearguments put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Representatives that administrative diffi-culties should not be held to outweigh the principle that the Allies were entitledto these assets (which had been under Allied control since 1945), as reparations.The argument that His Majesty&apos;s Government would find it difficult to defend a peace Treaty^which allowed these assets to be returned to Japan was received withsome sympathy but did not prove convincing.15- It has thus become clear that the United States Government are unlikely to accept our view on this point. Since the United States argument is based mainly on the administrative difficulty of obtaining and liquidating the assets in question(these difficulties are not small owing to the fact that the agreement of the U.S.S.R.and China would be necessary to unfreeze the most valuable assets which are inSwitzerland, Sweden, and Afghanistan), it is submitted that we should now proposea composition. The United States Representatives might be informed that HisMajesty*s Government would be prepared to agree to Japanese assets in neutral countries being left to Japan by the Peace Treaty, provided Japan were obliged topay to the Allies a total sum of about 20 million dollars to cover their value.Out of this amount, His Majesty&apos;s Government would, of course, expect to receiveimmediately the value of the Swiss francs held by Japan in Switzerland in respectof payments for the relief of prisoners of war. The division of the rest of this sumamongst the Far Eastern Commission Powers might take some time, but it is not considered that these difficulties would be insuperable.16. It is recommended that His Majesty&apos;s Representatives should beauthorised to put this proposal to Mr. Dulles as an alternative to that containedin Article 28 of the United Kingdom draft treaty.Machinery for the Settlement of Disputes17. On 2nd January the Cabinet approved a proposal (CP. (50) 323, para-,graph 8 (n)) that &quot; claims disputes arising out of the Peace Treaty should be settled by a special neutral tribunal to be set up by the President of the International Courtof Justice, and other disputes arising out of the Treaty should be referred either .todiplomatic settlement or to the International Court of Justice.&quot; This proposal wasembodied in the United Kingdom draft treaty as Article 35 (CP. (51) 104, Annex A).18. During the recent conversations in Washington, the United States Repre-sentatives were opposed to providing in the Treaty for the reference of claimsdisputes to a special tribunal. The United Kingdom argument that provision forsuch a tribunal would be useful since cases arising out of the claims and restitutionarticles of the Treaty might not, in many cases, be susceptible of a purely judicialdecision by the International Court, while not rejected, have not yet been accepted by
the United States Representatives.  No further communication has been receivedfrom the United States Government as to their attitude on this question.19. If nothing further is received before Mr. Dulles comes to London on 2nd June, it is suggested that an attempt should be made to convince the UnitedStates Government of the utility of the provision contained in Article 35 (1) of theUnited Kingdom draft. The United States Representatives may, however, be inclined to insist that the Treaty should contain provision only for reference to theInternational Court if other agreed means of settlement \e.g., reference to concilia-tion) prove ineffective.20. The first sentence of Article 21 of the draft Treaty ait (Annex A) states&quot;if, in the opinion of any party to the present treaty, there has arisen a disputeconcerning the interpretation or execution of the treaty which is not settled byother agreed means the dispute shall, at the request of any party thereto, be referred for decision to the International Court or Justice.&quot; This formula would not rule out the reference of claims disputes to a neutral tribunal by agreement betweenthe States concerned, and Japan. If, therefore, the United States RepresentativesTemain strongly averse to lengthening the treaty, by the inclusion of UnitedKingdom Article 35 (i), it is recommended that the form of words quoted above should be accepted.
