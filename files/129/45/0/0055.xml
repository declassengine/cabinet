(51) 13017TH MAY, 1951CABINETADMISSION OF GREECE AND TURKEY TO THENORTH ATLANTIC treaty memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs on the 15th May the United States Ambassador informed theForeign Office that the United States Government favoured the adherence of greece and Turkey to the&quot;North Atlantic Treaty,2. The reasons for this view are set out in the attached Aide Memoire.3, The Aide Memoire rehearses the political and military reasonsfor strengthening defence relationship between Greece and Turkey and theWestern Powers and the advantages and disadvantages of doing so by meansof(a) a Mediterranean Treaty, and(b) full Greek and Turkish membership of the North Atlantic treaty organisation (N.A.T.O.).It concludes that the disadvantages of a Mediterranean Treaty outweighits advantages, and that full Greek and Turkish membership of the north atlantic Treaty is therefore necessary.4. The purpose of this paper is to seek the authority of the cabinet for our acceptance of the United States proposal.Background5, At its New York meeting in September, 1950, the North atlantic council, in response to Turkish pressure, agreed on a compromise whichallowed Turkey and Greece &quot;to be associated as appropriate with suchphases of military planning work of the North Atlantic Treaty organisation as are concerned with the defence of the Mediterranean&quot;.   Since that time,although Turkish and Greek officers have had meetings with the StandingGroup, nothing effective has been done to implement the council s decision.The Turkish Government and public opinion have been becoming restive atthis lack of progress, and have reverted insistently to their desire to beadmitted to full membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation,The Greek Government, though with less insistence, have adopted asimilar attitude.
6. The United Kingdom attitude has so far been that the Turkish and greek desire to be hitched to the North Atlantic Treaty could best be met by the compromise plan approved by the North Atlantic Council.   Thiswould, however, not be enough either to satisfy the Turks or to ensure fullTurkish co-operation with the defence effort of the Western Powers, and wehave therefore hoped to supplement it:(a) by agreeing also to associate Turkey with the defence of the middle east by close liaison with the British Middle East Command; and(b) by persuading the United States to extend her present commitmentstowards Turkey by means of a unilateral guarantee supplementingthe Treaties of Alliance which the French and ourselves have with turkey.New Factors in the Situation7. It was becoming clear, even before the receipt of the UnitedStates Governments communication of 15th May, that this three-point programme (Turkish association with a N.A.T.O. MediterraneanCommand, Turkish liaison with the British Middle East Command and a united States guarantee of Turkey) would be difficult to realise.   In thefirst place, it has so far not been possible to reach agreement on the command in the Mediterranean.   Secondly, the Turks (acting apparently under theimpression that they were meeting United States wishes) have disownedan agreement reached between General Robertson and the Turkish GeneralStaff for defence co-operation with British Middle East Headquarters.Finally, it is now evident from their Aide Memoire that the United StatesGovernment are only prepared to extend a guarantee to Turkey (and Greece)in the context of N.A.T.O., i. e., by full Turkish (and Greek) membership of the North Atlantic Treaty,8. United States opinion has for some time been moving towards this solution.   In a recent Senate debate and in the testimony of witnesses beforethe Joint Senate Committees, there was remarkable unanimity of opinionthat Turkey and Greece (also Spain and possibly Yugoslavia) should beadmitted to the Atlantic Pact.   These views were expressed in strong termsby Generals Eisenhower, Bradley, Clay, Spaatz and George and by AdmiralSherman.   General Eisenhower said:   &quot;You do not have to be a soldierto know the great value which would accrue to freedom within the UnitedStates by including these countries - Spain, Turkey, Greece and Yugoslavia. &quot;General Marshall was not opposed and even Senator Taft appeared to favour the inclusion of these countries.   With this weight of influence in favour,American official opinion has now crystallised.9. Turkish opinion too has become increasingly anxious, and in a recent debate in the Turkish Parliament the Turkish Foreign Minister made a renewed appeal for full Turkish membership.   The Turkish public aretending to believe that, whereas the United States (and even Italy) are preparedto sponsor Turkish membership, opposition springs from their best friends,the United Kingdom and France.   His Majestyrs Ambassador in Ankara hasurged that the time has come for Turkey to be admitted to full membership.10, The Greek Government have similarly expressed their concern atthe lack of progress in associating Greece with our defence system. Theyhave not made any demand for full membership but have indicated that they expect it if the Turks are admitted.
United Kingdom objections to Turkish and Greek Membership11. Our main objections to the admission of Turkey and Greece to full membership have been:(i)  It will require the consent of all the North Atlantic Treaty Powers,some of whom, such as Norway and Denmark, may be reluctant to extend their commitments.   The French are strongly opposedto it and have instructed their Ambassador in Washington torepresent their objections to the State Department.   They havealso urged us to support them in their opposition.(ii)  The extension of the North Atlantic Treaty to the Middle East,which Turkish membership would involve, might provoke requests for membership from other Middle East countries.(iii)  The work of the various N.A.T.O. agencies would be complicated by the addition of two more countries, particularlycountries which differ in their social and political structure fromthe existing members of the Organisation.(iv)  By the admission of Turkey, the alliance would tend to lose its&quot;North Atlantic&quot; character as an association of like-mindeddemocratic nations with a common historical background, and tobecome an encircling alliance of countries bordering on theSoviet Union,   Turkey is situated in a dangerous area and is adirect neighbour of Russia,   At present there is no point (exceptnorthern Norway) at which the N.A.T.O. directly touches theSoviet frontiers.   The admission of Turkey, by extending thispoint of contact, would increase the danger of a clash.   It is mainly for this reason that the French Government are opposed to the idea.Reasons for changing our attitude12. On the other hand, there are even stronger reasons for accepting the American proposal:(i)  It would extend American military commitments into the eastern mediterranean area.   This has always been our object, and the admission of Turkey and Greece to N.A.T.O. must be regarded asthe price we have to pay for it if the United States will not extend their commitments in that area in any other way;(ii)  It would obtain for N.A.T.O. the use of the substantial and effectiveTurkish armed forces and of Turkish bases;(iii)  The Americans, having once made up their mind, are likely to exert pressure both on ourselves and on the smaller N.A.T.countries.   This would be known to Greece and Turkey and itwould be damaging to our relations with them if we were known tobe standing out against their admission to N.A.T.O. when the americans were pressing for it and when this was the only means by which they could obtain the American commitment whichthey so clearly need.   We are not ourselves in a position to offer the Turks in the Middle East the material assurances of military support which would justify us in advising them to forego theadvantages of N.A.T.O. membership-;
(iv)  It would be difficult to continue to exclude from the Western&quot;defence club&quot; two countries so closely aligned with Westernpolicy.   If either Turkey or Greece were attacked, they would almost certainly have to be supported by the N.A.T, Powers,whether or not they were members of the Organisation;(v)  We should not be extending our commitment to Turkey, since weare already bound by treaty to go to her aid if attacked.13. The alternative of a Mediterranean Treaty, which the Americansthemselves suggest and reject in their aide memoire, has never so far been fully explored.   My general view is, however, that the arguments onthis point in paragraph 4 of the American aide-memoire are sound andthat a Mediterranean Pact would offer no advantages over Greek and turkish membership of N.A.T.O.Conclusion14, I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that we should accept theAmerican proposal for the admission of Greece and Turkey to the north atlantic Treaty Organisation and should support it when the question is raised by the North Atlantic Council Deputies.H.

AIDE-MEMOIRE1,     The United States Government has for some time had under continuing study the desirability of strengthening the security commitments between the western powers and greece and Turkey.      Such action is considered essential in the light of both political and military considerations.2C      Political factors include the desire of Greece and turkey to become full parties to the North Atlantic Treaty,their dissatisfaction with their present limited form of association with it, the importance of ensuring theirbelligerency on the side of the West from the outset of anyhostilities between the U.S, S.R. and the West, the feeling in Greece and Turkey that neither their existing treatyties with the United Kingdom and Prance nor the so-called&quot;Truman Doctrine&quot; are sufficient to deter Soviet aggression against them, and the importance of preventing in Greece and turkey the development of public support for a policy of neutrality,,3-     From the military point of view it is essential tosecure the southern flank of the N.AoT. forces, to control the Mediterranean Sea and to secure air and sea communicationsthroughout that area.      Conversely, it is important toensure that the U.SeS,R.  is not afforded a protected flankfor its possible operations against Europe and/or theMiddle East as would be the case if Turkey remained neutral,,In addition, the entrance of Greece and Turkey on the side iof the western powers at the outset of a general war would(a) force upon the Soviet a significantly large diversion of effort, (b) contribute to and facilitate the defence of theMediterranean Sea and the Middle East and (c) provide a major contribution of strength to the Western Powers.h.      One way of accomplishing the objective of strengthening the security commitments to Turkey and Greece would be bythe conclusion of a &quot;Mediterranean Treaty&quot; with termssimilar to those of the N.A. T.      There are, however, serious objections to the conclusion of such a treaty: (a) It would establish a new military organisation which would overlapwith the NB A, T.O. , duplicating and complicating many of themilitary functions of the latter; (b) It would not achieve the basic objectives of insuring collective action against aggression on the part of all of the nations of Western Europe;(c) It would involve competition for military forces and    ;material between the two separate treaty organisationswhereas under a single pact, such as the N0A9T. , themilitary forces and materials available to the pact nations are allocated among those nations by common agreement;(d) It would require the establishment of additionalmilitary commands, channels of command and communications which would be unwieldy and would seriously complicatemilitary operations and planning; and (e) it would open thepossibility of having to include various other countries inthe Mediterranean area such as Syria, Israel, Egypt, etc.Such a possibility involves obvious and serious difficulties and complications.5.     Another means of strengthening the security commitments to Greece and Turkey ?/ould be to invite these countries to adhere to the N.A.T.      This course has obvious advantages:(a) It would be the quickest and easiest way of bringing
these countries into the overall defence picture, an advantage of great importance in the light of the present world situation; (b) It is the preference of Greece and turkey themselves and would, therefore, increase their co-operativeness and facilitate their participation in military planning for the area; (c) It would insure their immediate belligerency in the event of war and thus greatlyfacilitate Western military operations; and (d) Greece and turkey are already associated with N. A.T.O. for planning&apos;1purposes.6.      There are, of course, objections to Greece&apos;and Turkeyadhereing to the N.A.T. : (a) The conception of theNorth Atlantic community of countries with common cultural,religious, social and economic heritage and future does not readily lend itself to the thought of Greco-Turkishparticipation; (b) Most parties to the N.A.T. wouldprobably be reluctant to see a broadening of their securitycommitments, the immediate benefits of which they may notperceive; (c) There would be obvious complications resultingfrom an enlarged membership.7.      In the light of the above it is the view of theUnited States Government that the disadvantages of a mediterranean pact outweigh its advantages and that theadvantages of Greek and Turkish adherence to the N.A.T.outweigh its disadvantages.     The United States Government,therefore, favours the adherence of Greece and Turkey tothe N.A. T.8.     The United States Government believes that the relationship of Greece and Turkey to the N.A.T.  should bediscussed by the North Atlantic Council Deputies at a very early date.     It hopes that the British Government willshare its views that their adherence to the Treaty will bethe best solution and would welcome an early indication ofits views.      A similar approach is being made to theFrench Government.9.     Despite the recent unauthorised publicity on thissubject, the United States Government hopes that any public indication that it is currently under intergovern-mental discussion can be avoided,,(intld.)
