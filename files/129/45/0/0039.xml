-    251(THIS DOG-U-MEN-T IS- THE PROPERTY OF HIS britannic-MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret 1CP. (51) 114 COPY NO.20TH APRIL, 1951CABINETPERSIAN OILMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs since the Defence Committee meeting on 2nd April, 1951,at which my memorandum D. O. (51) 38 of 29th March was considered(D. O. (51) 7th Meeting, Minute 1), the Persian Government have replied toour Note of 14th March; there have been constant talks with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C,) on the form that a new agreement with the persians might take;  a United Kingdom delegation, headed by HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington, has been discussing Persian affairs with the State Department in an attempt to work out a common policy; andrioting has broken out in the South Persian oilfields,   I do not proposehowever to consider that last development in this paper:  we are watchingmatters closely, and I shall at once consult my colleagues should thesituation deteriorate.2.    PERSIAN NOTE.   A copy of this is annexed. . Having regard to theearlier nationalist emotion in Tehran it is mild enough, and calls for no reply.3.    FORM OF NEW AGREEMENT.    It is, I suggest, a fundamental factthat, if the Persians &quot;nationalise&quot; their oil industry, they will not be able,at their present stage of development, to operate it efficiently withoutforeign assistance.   We must try to meet their national aspirations; but,in so doing, we must bear in mind the following considerations to which,in my view, His Majesty&apos;s Government should attach importance:-(a) The maintenance of an independent Persia,(b) The maintenance of our oil supplies from Persia (this is of greatstrategic as well as economic importance).(c) The control over the distribution of Persian oil that is so important to our balance of payments.(d) His Majesty&apos;s Governments revenue from A.I.O.C. by means oftaxation and dividend.(e) The repercussions of any settlement with Persia on the interestsof British Companies operating in other countries.These all demand that our primary object must be to ensure that effective control of oil operations in Persia remains with the Company.4. Various proposals have been examined in the light of these considerations. ,They are listed below in descending order of preferencefrom the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government.
(i) A Company incorporated in the United Kingdom with 100% A.I.O.C,shareholding;  some Persian directors on the Board (but not enough to give the Persians control of the Company);an equal sharing of the profits between the Persian Government and-the Company;  and the transfer to another (purely Persian)Company of the distribution of oil products within Persia itself.(ii) A minority Persian shareholding, or a holding which did not give the persians equality of voting rights, in a United Kingdom incor-porated Company, and an equal sharing of profits.   (Thedifficulty here would be to hold the position against a demandfor voting parity.)(iii) A 50% Persian shareholding in a United Kingdom incorporatedCompany, and an equal sharing of profits.   (This would give nomeans of ensuring that effective control remained with theBritish directors, and at worst would produce stalemate.)(iv)  Vesting, without payment, the Company&apos;s assets in Persia in thePersian Government, who would in compensation lease them free of rent for 42 years (the remainder of A.I,O.C.&apos;s present tenure)to a United Kingdom incorporated Company entirely owned byA.I.O.C.; and an equal sharing of profits.   (Apart from diffi-culties over financing new development, this arrangement would almost certainly involve the abrogation of the existing concession,thereby subjecting the Company to the jurisdiction of thePersian Courts and invoking the Majlis resolution of 1947which prohibits the granting of a new concession to a company with foreign shareholders.   It would evidently demand also a lease in the firmest terms.)(v) A Company incorporated in Persia, with 100% A.I.O.C. shareholdingand an equal sharing of profits.   (This would put the Company atthe mercy of Persian law.)(vi) Expropriation of the assets in Persia, followed by a managementcontract with A.I.O.C. (This would make the A.I.O.C. the servantof the Persian Government.)5, With the exception of (vi), each of these proposals contemplates anew Company formed to operate in regard only to Persia, on a basis of an equal sharing of profits with the Persians and with Persian directors on theBoard.   Under the existing concession, however, the Persians participate in the world-wide prosperity of A.I.O.C,  They are unlikely to be willing to surrender this benefit, and would certainly claim that it is from theprofits of Persian oil that A.I.O.C. have developed their world-wideoperations.   There are strong objections to making this concession overand above an equal sharing of Persian profits, since it would give Persiasubstantially more than she could claim on any basis of equity and would create a dangerous precedent for all Companies operating oil (or indeed anyother) concessions abroad.   The possibility of making specific allowance for participation in the general prosperity of the Company in the composition of the 50% share of Persian profits is under consideration.This might be a useful negotiating point,6.    THE WASHINGTON TALKS.    The Americans agree that it isessential for control of the Persian oil industry to remain with the A.I.O.C.:but opinions differ about what the Persians mean by &quot;nationalisation&quot;
(they themselves have never defined it).   The Americans tend to assume that the Persians will not be satisfied without some degree of ownership of the Companyfs assets in Persia, in addition to the oil in the ground whichthey own already.   H. M. Ambassador at Tehran, on the other hand,believes that the Persians are already having second thoughts and realise that full &quot;nationalisation&quot; is impracticable.   He considers that for us to acceptPersian expropriation at the outset would be interpreted as a capitulation,severely damaging to our prestige; and he suggests that the Persianswould be satisfied with a 50:50 profit-sharing arrangement, garnished insuch a way as to permit the Persian Government to claim that it metPersia&apos;s national aspirations.7. Owing to this basic difference of opinion (which stillpersists) between ourselves and the Americans the course of the talks in washington was not altogether smooth.   In the result, however, the americans agreed that the first proposal at paragraph 4 above &quot;made someaccommodation to nationalisation&quot;, but recommended us to consider&quot;an additional facade&quot; which, while providing yet further accommodation,would still maintain our effective control.   They themselves would give us, ata minimum, benevolent backing and would take a stronger line if they feltour discussions with the Persians were going well.8, The way is therefore open, if my colleagues agree, to our putting the first proposal in paragraph 4 above to the Persians.  I do not think thatat this stage we should, merely in deference to the Americans&apos; opinion, go further than that.   We must however recognise that this proposal may not satisfy the Persians, who may well put forward their own proposition,I would not suggest that we need now consider hypothetical cases; but Iwould note that, of the proposals in paragraph 4, only (iv) and (vi) can besaid to provide for full nationalisation, if by that the Persians mean anoutright transfer to them of ownership of the Company&apos;s assets in Persia.9.    FUTURE TACTICS ,   H.M. Ambassador at Tehran has reportedevidence that the extremist National Front are becoming apprehensive of the possible results of their &quot;nationalisation&quot; policy, and might be preparedto agree to a new arrangement with the Company.   He believes also thatPersian opinion might welcome a strong lead from us, and be glad to haveofficial discussions at governmental level.   There is the danger also that theMajlis Oil Commission may hasten their investigations, already begun, into the praticability of &quot;nationalisation&quot; and commit themselves to an extreme course;this I feel we should try to forestall.   It may well be therefore that theinitiative in seeking negotiations should come from us.10. I would accordingly suggest that H. M. Ambassador at Tehranshould at the earliest appropriate moment be instructed to sound the PersianPrime Minister informally, to probe his reaction and to determine an appropriate basis for opening negotiations.   The line he might take would,I think, be:To point to the mutual interests of Persia and the United kingdom in Persian oil, to explain that His Majesty&apos;s Government hadbeen considering how the natural desire of the Persian people toplay a more direct part in the Persian oil industry might beharmonised with the legitimate rights of the A.I.O.C. and theinterests of the United Kingdom, and to go on to outline our proposal for a new agreement.To propose an exchange of notes between His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Persian Government which would serve as a basis onwhich future negotiations were to be conducted and provide for
consultation together on all matters of importance or points of difficulty which might arise under the operation of any new agreement.   (If agreed to, this would serve to putnegotiations on to a governmental level and, we might hope,provide for inter-governmental consultation for the future.)(c)  To suggest to the Persian Prime Minister that a negotiatingmission from this country should visit Tehran as soon as order had been restored in the oilfields.11. If this approach met with an encouraging response, there would,I think, be great advantage in the negotiations themselves being begununder the aegis of His Majesty&apos;s Government.   For this purpose I would suggest that the Mission contemplated in the preceding paragraph should beheaded by a junior Minister, and accompanied by a Director of A.I.O.C,(preferably Mr. Jackson, the Deputy Chairman).   The leader would be assisted by a team of experts from the Treasury, the Ministry of Fuel and power and perhaps the Bank of England, and receive political advice from. M. Ambassador at Tehran.14, To sum up, I would ask approval:(i)       To the proposal in paragraph 4(i) as the basis on which negotiations with the Persians might open,(ii)       To my instructing H, M. Ambassador at Tehran to take the informal sounding indicated in paragraph 10 and, if the reactionwere favourable, to go on to suggest to the Persian PrimeMinister that a Mission of the kind proposed in paragraph 11 should -visit Tehran as soon as order had been restored in the oilfields.H.M.Foreign Office, S. W. 1,,20th April, 1951.-4-
-   &apos; ANNEXPersian reply, dated 8th April, 1951, to the Note from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment dated 14th March, 1951In acknowledging receipt of Your Excellency&apos;s note No, 30of 14th March, 1951, I wish to bring the following to your attention.The Imperial Persian Government in its turn is very anxious to maintain and strengthen friendly relations and mutual confidence in all mattersbetween the peoples and governments of Persia and Britain,As for the question of oil, as Your Excellency is aware, the PersianGovernment^ business is with the A.I.O.C. and that company has notraised the matter or made any statements.   However, since you have seen fit to enter on this question, I consider it necessary not to leaveYour Excellency&apos;s note unanswered, and the following points must there-fore be mentioned:(i)       In spite of the changes that have taken place in the world situation in general and in the social life and public opinion of Persiain particular, and in spite of the statement I made Your Excellency on june 8th 1950 when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs, the companypaid no attention to the justified claims of Persia and declared the draftsupplemental agreement to be their maximum possible limit of concession,although events had made it clear that public opinion in this country didnot consider that bill as sufficiently assuring the rights of the Persianpeople,(ii)       As you know, the present position is that both Houses ofthe Majlis have unanimously accepted the principle of nationalisation ofthe oil industry and the Special Oil Commission is now studying how to putthat principle into practice, in order to submit its proposals to both houses of the Majlis for final decision.  At present the Governments onlyobligation is to await the result of the Commission^ deliberations.
