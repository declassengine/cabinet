The action to be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government on three of the conventions and Recommendations adopted by the Thirty-Second Session of theInternational Labour Conference held at Geneva in 1949 has not yet been deter-mined. These are the Convention (No. 95) and the Recommendation (No. 85)concerning the Protection of Wages and the Convention (No. 96) concerning Fee-Charging Employment Agencies. The texts of these three instruments were published in Cmd. 7852.2. The present Paper describes the provisions of the Convention and the associated Recommendation concerning the protection of wages. It proposes the ratification of the Convention andLsubject to two reservations, the acceptance ofthe Recommendation. CP. (51) l*?f circulated separately, puts forward proposalsfor legislation designed to enable the Convention concerning fee-charging employ-ment agencies to be ratified in due course. If both these proposals are approved the Cabinet is invited to agree to the issue of a Command Paper in the terms ofthe Annex to this Paper.Convention No. 953. The Convention is designed to ensure that workers shall receive the fullbenefit of their wages and to protect them from certain abuses. It deals with suchmatters as: payment of wages in legal tender; regulation of payment in kind,including the prohibition of payment in the form of liquor of high alcoholic contentor of noxious drugs; payment of wages direct to the worker; freedom of the workerto dispose of his wages; protection of the workers from coercion to use works storesfor the sale of commodities or other services provided by the undertaking; regula-tion of the conditions under which deductions may be made from wages; regulationof the attachment of wages and their protection in cases where the undertakingbecomes bankrupt; regular payment of wages; and prohibition of payment intaverns.The Convention applies to &quot; all persons to whom wages are paid orpayable.&quot; ( &quot; &apos;&quot;4. The law and practice of the United Kingdom is in accordance with all therequirements of the Convention in so far as workers covered by the Truck Actsare concerned. These Acts do not, however, cover non-manual and domesticworkers and without further legislation certain provisions of the Convention cannotbe applied to these classes of workers nor the provisions of the Convention as awhole to all persons to whom wages are paid or payable. There is, however, aprovision in Article 2 (2) of the Convention whereby the competent authority mayexclude from the application of any or all of the provisions of the Conventionany categories of workers to whom their application would be inappropriate andwho are employed in non-manual or domestic work.  Any such exclusions canCopy No.3140601
only be made after consultation with the organisations of employers and employed persons directly concerned (where such exist) and must be indicated in the firstannual report to the International Labour Office on the application of the Conven-tion. Thereafter ho further exclusions are admissible./ . 5. I do not propose that new legislation should be introduced in order toenable the provisions of the Convention to be applied to all wage earnerSj butrecommend that the United Kingdom Government should ratify this convention and take advantage of Article 2 (2) to exclude non-manual and domestic workers from the operation of those Articles of the Convention whose requirements cannot,under present conditions, be satisfied in respect of them. The Articles in questionnaire Articles 3-1.1 inclusive and Article 13 (2).6. After ratification, I would propose to enter into formal consultations with the British Employers&apos; Confederation and the Trades Union Congress as required by Article 2 (2) of the Convention. No obligation is imposed by theConvention to undertake such consultations before ratification. Informal contacthas, however, been made with the two organisations concerned. I understandthat no objection is likely to be raised by the British Employers&apos; Confederationwhen formal consultation takes place. The Trades Union Congress, on the otherhand, will&apos;probably press for the protection afforded by the Convention to beextended to all workers. While I would hope that it may be possible to reachgeneral agreement on this issue, the Convention does not in fact require the com-petent authority to reach agreement with the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisationsbefore exclusions are made under - Article 2 (2).Recommendation No. 85        - -7. The Recommendation is supplementary to Convention No. 95. It dealsWith such matters as limitation and regulation of deduction from wages, periodicityof wage payments, notification to workers of wage conditions, wages statements and payroll records and association of workers in the administration of works stores.8. The law and practice of the United Kingdom is, in general, in accordancewith the Recommendation and I think we can accept it, subject to the two points which follow:-(1) Paragraphs 1-3 of the Recommendation.&apos;deal with deductions from wages.While the general practice in the United Kingdom is in accordancewith the provisions of these paragraphs, the only legislative provisionsregulating their application is to be found in the Truck Acts. In orderto avoid creating the impression that the Government intend to extend the protection afforded by the Truck Acts to non-manual workers it isnecessary to refer in the public announcement of acceptance to the limitations imposed by the existing legislation.(2) As regards paragraphs 4-8 of the Recommendation, which deal withperiodicity of wage payments, notification to workers of wage conditions and wages statements and payroll records, these are matters in whichflexibility is essential and which in the United Kingdom are regardedas appropriate for settlement between employers and workers in rela-tion to circumstances arising in particular cases.I propose that the United Kingdom Government should accept the Recom-mendation subject to reservations on these two points.9. The Ministry of Labour and National Insurance of Northern Ireland havebeen consulted and concur in the action which is proposed on Convention No. 95and Recommendation No. 85.Convention No. 9610. In CP. (51) i3&amp;I have submitted, in agreement with the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland, proposals for legislation which wouldenable the Government to ratify this Convention in due course.Issue of Command Paper //v,11. If the proposals contained in this memorandum and in CP. ^51) tfe are approved, authority for the issue of a Command Paper in the terms of the annex to this memorandum is sought.A.

INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCEThere are set out below the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government on aConvention and a Recommendation concerning the Protection of Wages anda Convention concerning Fee-Charging Employment Agencies adopted by theInternational Labour Conference at its 32nd Session in 1949, which it isproposed to communicate to the Director-General of the International LabourOffice. The English and French texts of these Conventions and the Recom-mendation were presented to Parliament in Cmd. 7852.Convention (No. 95) Concerning the Protection of WagesRecommendation (No. 85) Concerning the Protection of Wages1. The Convention is designed to ensure that workers shall receive thefull benefit of their wages and to protect them from certain abuses. It dealswith such matters as: payment of wages in legal tender; regulation of payment in kind, including the prohibition of payment in the form of liquorof high alcoholic content or of noxious drugs ; payment of wages direct to the worker ; freedom of the worker to dispose of his wages ; protectionof the worker from coercion to use works&apos; stores for the sale of commoditiesor other services provided by the undertaking; regulation of the conditions under which deductions may be made from wages ; regulation of the attach-ment of wages and their protection in cases where the undertaking becomesbankrupt; regular payment of wages ; and prohibition of payment in taverns.The Convention applies to all persons to whom wages are paid or payablebut Article 2 (2) provides that the competent authority may, after consulta-tion with the organisations of employers and workers directly concerned,exclude from the application of any or all of the provisions of the Conventioncategories of workers in whose cases their application would not be appropriate and who are employed in non-manual or domestic service orwork similar thereto. The law of the United Kingdom is in accordance withthe provisions in Articles 3-11 inclusive and Article 13(2) of the Conven-tion so far as workers other than non-manual and domestic workers areconcerned, and the provisions of the other Articles of the Convention areof general application in the United Kingdom. His Majesty&apos;s government propose to ratify this Convention but, having regard to the existing state ofthe law in the United Kingdom, it will be necessary, after ratification, to enterinto consultation with the appropriate organisations of employers and workers as provided in Article 2 (2) of the Convention with a view to the exclusion of workers who are employed in non-manual work or .domestic service or work similar thereto from the application of those Articles ofthe Convention whose provisions cannot be applied to them on the basisof the existing law.2. The Recommendation contains proposals of a more detailed nature.As regards paragraphs 1-3 of the Recommendation, which deal with deduc-tions from wages, His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that the general practice in the United Kingdom is in conformity with those provisions. Theexisting law, however, applies to manual workers only, and does not extend to non-manual and domestic workers. Paragraphs 4-8 of the Recommenda-tion deal in detail with the periodicity of payment, notification to workers ofwages conditions, wages statements and pay-roll records. While the practice in the United Kingdom is in accordance with these conditions, His Majesty&apos;s
Government consider that these are matters in which flexibility is essential and which are appropriate for settlement between employers and workers inrelation to the circumstances existing in particular cases. Subject to reserva-tions on these points His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to accept theRecommendation.Convention (No. 96) Concerning Fee-Charging Employment Agencies3. The Convention is designed to prevent abuses which may arise fromthe engagement of workers through thcmedium of fee-charging employment agencies. States members who ratify the Convention may do so on one oftwo alternative bases. On the one hand, the Convention provides for theabolition of fee-charging employment agencies conducted for profit withina hmited time to be determined by the competent authority of the country concerned. It is laid down that abolition shall not take place until a publicemployment service is established. During the period preceding abolition,ratifying countries are required to subject such agencies to the supervision of the competent authority. Exemption from abolition may be allowed in exceptional cases where appropriate placing services cannot conveniently bemade available within the framework of the public employment service. Thispart of the Convention further provides for supervision of the operation offee-charging employment agencies not conducted for profit.4. As an alternative to . the abolition of fee-charging employment agencies conducted for profit another part of the Convention provides forsupervision and control of such agencies. The measures laid down in theConvention are as follows:  (1) Agencies are to be in possession of a yearly licence, renewable at the discretion of the competent authority.(2) Fees and expenses are not to be in excess of a scale submitted to and approved by the competent authority or fixed by the competent authority.(3) The placing or recruiting of workers abroad is only to be carried on if the competent authority permits.This part of the Convention also provides for the supervision of fee-chargingemployment agencies not conducted for profit.5. His Majesty&apos;s Government have given very careful consideration tothe terms of this Convention, and they have come to the conclusion that itwould be in the public interest to provide for such a measure of super-vision and control over the activities of fee-charging employment agenciesas would enable them to ratify the Convention on the alternative basisdescribed in paragraph 4 above. They propose therefore to introduce thenecessary legislation in due course.
