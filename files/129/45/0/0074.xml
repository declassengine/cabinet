C^iMXuJ Miff IffTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENT       JPrinted for the Cabinet.  May 1951SECRET Copy No.31CP. (51) 14929th May, 1951CABINETRESALE PRICE maintenance memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeAfter considering a memorandum (CP. (51) 37) submitted jointly by my pre-predecessor and the Minister of Local Government and Planning, the Cabinet at their meeting on 15th February (CM. (51) 14th Conclusions, Minute 6):  &quot; (1) Approved in principle the proposals in CP. (51) 37 for prohibiting collectivemeasures to enforce resale price maintenance and the indication of resale prices by individual suppliers.(2) Agreed that the practicability of introducing a provision declaring discrimination -nation in the supply of goods to be unlawful and providing for civilremedies should be further explored.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to submit to the Cabinet at anearly date the draft of a White Paper explaining the government&apos;s policy in regard to resale price maintenance.&quot;2. I now submit for the consideration of my colleagues the attached draft ofthe White Paper. In this memorandum I should like to draw attention to the main points of presentation and substance arising on the draft White Paper and to ask my colleagues, after considering these points, to approve the draft for presentation to Parliament as soon as possible.Presentation3. The draft White Paper has been prepared in three sections. The firstdescribes the practice and sets out the Governmenfs objections to it; the secondanswers in advance some of the arguments commonly used in its defence; and thethird summarises the recent history of the subject and expounds our proposals.Three points of presentation seem to me worth considering; they mainly concern the first part of the draft. These are as follows: -(a) There has been discussion about a more &quot; emotive &quot; name for the practice.Should such a name be invented now and written into the draft?(b) Should the tone of the draft generally be popularised?(c) Subject to what I say in the last paragraph, is the emphasis in the expositionabout right as between the economic reasons for abolition (the hope of price reductions through increased competition, the possible effect onthe cost of living and so forth) and the reasons based on dislike of extra-legal collective sanctions? Or should more stress be laid on one orother of these?4. A New Name. On consideration I think it would be better not to introduce a new name for the practice in the White Paper. I agree that a more emotive formulawould be valuable but it would, perhaps, be better as a weapon for campaigningin the country than in a White Paper, which is conventionally intended to form abasis for Parliamentary discussion. In this connexion I should add that I do nottlhnk the suggestion of &quot;retail price rigging&quot; for the new name would do. the trouble with &quot; resale price maintenance &quot; is that it is not sufficiently explanatory:but &quot; retail price rigging,&quot; while certainly emotive, gives no better idea of what the40653 b
practice is. Indeed it is not accurate, since &quot;rigging&quot; usually implies some kindof price discrimination if not of dishonesty.. I should myself prefer something onthe lines of &quot; the prevention of price reductions &quot; as being clearer and more effective; I have in fact introduced this idea into the title of the White Paper andat one or two points in the text. But I do not think it would be appropriate to use it as the short title of the paper.5. Popularisation. It would be possible to give the White Paper a morepopular tone. In particular the opening description of the practice could be givenin more graphic and personal terms by depicting, for example, the plight of an individual trader who tries to pass on the benefits of his low costs to his customersand is smashed by the &quot;ring.&quot; Here again, however, I think it will be better tokeep within the conventional limits of the White Paper form. The press will in any event popularise the issue (although not necessarily in the sense we would wish!)and we can and should use the graphic method for presenting the case in thecountry. But we do not want, I suggest, the vulgarisation of White Papers made an issue.6. Emphasis. It will be seen that the draft rests the Governmenfs case on two main planks. The first is the economic argument that, by eliminating competi-tion in a wide range of trade, resale price maintenance prevents some price reductions which could and should be made. It also slows up technical progress in distribution (e.g., self-service methods) because the trader who makes improvements and lowers his costs cannot by offering lower prices obtain a larger share of themarket. This, of course, is the more important plank because it bears both on individual and collective resale price maintenance. The second plank is the legal and social impropriety of collective sanctions imposed by private bodies; this one by itself, though highly important, makes no contribution to the case againstindividual resale price maintenance.7. The emphasis in the draft is placed pretty evenly on both planks. Some ofmy colleagues may feel that more should be made of the economic line of attack and that for propaganda purposes the whole operation should be represented moreas an assault on the cost-of-living problem with the stress laid on the price reductions which should ensue. I feel that it would be dangerous to overplay our hand in thisrespect. The abolition of resale price maintenance can do nothing to reverse the wider, external causes of rising prices; and in so far as there are shortages,ordinary economic pressures will keep prices at or near the permitted maxima,whether these are laid down in statutory price controls or by the manufacturersthemselves. Thus the immediate effect on prices of carrying through our proposals may well be limited to a comparatively narrow range of goods. It is, no doubt,true that, whatever the general price-level, the abolition of resale price maintenancewill result in some prices at some places being lower than the general level; in other words, some prices will be lower than they would otherwise have been, even though they may be higher (from other causes) than they are now. This effect may be ofsome value in cushioning the impact of any general price increase in branded goods.But it would be mistaken tactics to put too much stress on lower prices (whicheverybody will take to mean prices lower than they are now) if the most that wecan really expect is higher prices mitigated by reductions here and there from thenew general leveL I think, therefore, that the balance of the draft is about right and I recommend that it should be left as it is.Points of Substance8. I now turn to certain points of substance in the draft, on which my col-leagues may wish to add to or subtract from what is said. These are :(a) The scope of the prohibition of collective action (paragraph 34 of thedraft) and whether it should cover only resale price maintenance assuch or extend to all forms of retail price-fixing;(bj the &quot; discrimination &quot; issue;(c) the question whether any indication should be given that exemptions forsome trades from the effect of the proposed legislation will be considered;(d) the &quot; loss-leader &quot; issue.The last two of these points are closely bound up with considerations of the receptionour proposals are likely to get from the various interests concerned and how far itmay be expedient to forestall certain of the inevitable criticisms.
9. Retailers&apos; price rings-This is a small point which was only just touched on in paragraph 19 of CP; (51) 37. Briefly it is the question whether the prohibitionof collective price maintenance measures should bite only on those measures which involve: the participation Of suppliers-i.e. those in which the sanction of withholdingSupplies can be used or whether it should extend to price-fixing agreements purelyamong retailers. The Board of Trade view is that price agreements between retailersonly, without the sanction of withholding supplies, would be ineffective and inocuousand that to prohibit them without investigation-which would lay us open to aplausible charge of by-passing the Monopolies Commission-would not be worthwhile. The majority of Ministers on the Distribution and Marketing committee agreed with this view but it was generally felt that the matter should be further examined. My own view is that the best time to look at this again will be when we get down to drafting the relevant provision; only then in all probability shall we see clearly all the points (and difficulties) bearing on the matter. Paragraph 34 Ofthe draft has therefore been worded in such a way as to leave open both possibilities;and I suggest that we need not go further into the issue at this stage.10. Discrimination This problem was set out at length irt CP. (51) 37 (para-graphs 13 to 18) and the Cabinet considered that there was a prima facie case for including in any legislation a provision declaring discrimination unlawful and pro-viding for civil remedies; they asked that the practicability of such a provision should be further explored. As a result there was further correspondence betweenmyself (as Attorney-General) and the Board of Trade Solicitor. We agreed that thebest that could be done would be to insert a clause simply declaring.discrimination in respect of supplies (or terms of supply) against a trader on the ground only ofthe prices at which he sells goods to be unlawful; and to add a further clause,similar to that in the Monopolies Act, saying in effect that anybody might bringcivil proceedings against a supplier guilty of discrimination but that no criminal proceedings should lie against him.11. In considering the draft White Paper we now have to decide whether weshould say explicitly that we intend to make discrimination by individual suppliersunlawful in this way. On the one hand much of our party propaganda on thissubject has fastened on to this aspect and indeed has decribed the whole operation as &quot; action to prevent manufacturers and traders from stopping supplies toretailers who bring down prices &quot; without any qualification to suggest that organiseddiscrimination was primarily intended by this. Consequently our supporters willprobably expect an explicit provision against discrimination and if nothing is saidwe shall get questions about it. On the other hand I must point out that the clausesuggested in paragraph 10 for this purpose is not very satisfactory. It is unlikelythat many small traders will face the expense of protracted litigation againstwealthy manufacturing concerns; and even if they do, it is not clear how they will prove to the Court that the manufacturer has cut off their supplies on grounds of price and not on any one of a hundred other plausible grounds. There may perhaps be some value in declaring discrimination unlawful simply on the groundthat most manufacturers in this country would honestly attempt to keep within, thelaw. If, however, we mean by such a clause to confer a legal remedy on the victims of discrimination, we should realise that in all probability it will be a remedy openonly to the larger retail organisations, like the chain stores and the Co-troops., andone which will be uncertain even for them.12. For these reasons I should be loth to be committed at this stage toincluding a clause of this kind in the.legislation and I recommend that we shouldmake no explicit reference tp it in the White Paper. This is another matter inrespect of which I think the possibilities will become much clearer when we can see the whole of the legislation in draft and I do not think we should decide finallyabout a &quot;discrimination&quot; clause until then. Meanwhile in paragraph 42 of thedraft White Paper, which explains the effect of the provision against &quot; indicating &quot;resale prices other than as maxima, we have said &quot; the trader will not be debarred from making a reduction from the indicated price and the Government will be concerned to see that his freedom in this regard is not impaired.&quot; This last phraseis intended to leave the way open.for.a specific anti-discrimination clause, if wefinally decide on one, but not to commit us finally to one now. This is, I think, theright course. If challenged on this topic in a debate on the White Paper, I should propose to say that the Government is giving further consideration to the question.40653 &quot; b 2
13. Trades to be Covered by the Legislation.-In paragraph 43 of the draftI have left open the possibility of exempting some trades from the legislation if agood enough case can be made for this. For example, we shall, I am sure, haveto give a full hearing to those trades where &quot; after-sales &quot; service is important.Again, in some of the building material trades, where the goods are not sold &quot;overthe counter,&quot; there might be, I understand, special difficulties about the practical application of the proposed provisions and these will have to be examined withthe trades in consultation with the Ministry of Works. I do not say that we shall find any particular claims for exemption acceptable, and I appreciate the dangerof weakening the legislation if exemption is made too easy. I am sure, however,that we cannot avoid further consultations with particular trades before the Bill isdrafted and I think it would be wise to make a virtue of necessity and give thisindication in the White Paper. I strongly recommend, therefore, that paragraph 43of the draft be retained.14. The &quot; Loss-Leader &quot; Issue. Finally, there is the question how the draft white Paper should deal with the &quot; loss-leader &quot; argument and in this connectionwe must bear in mind the probable reactions to our proposals as a whole. briefly the picture, as I see it, is as follows. The independent traders who deal extensivelyin branded goods and some manufacturers in particular those whose total salesdepend more on the number of outlets than on price will be dead against us. most other classes of interested persons are divided and would come various parts of theway with us. Many manufacturers who now take part in price maintenance schemes would probably be relieved if the law insulated them effectively from distributors&apos;pressure. As the recent correspondence in the Daily Telegraph shows, theofficial Opposition is divided and several wish to see an end of collective enforce-ment. The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (U.S.D.A.W) is alsoagainst collective enforcement and &quot;discrimination against Co-troops., but wantsindividual producers to have some effective means of maintaining their own resale prices. To them the security and prosperity of the employers generally is the bestguarantee of favourable treatment of wage claims and they do not want resale price maintenance wholly abolished. Many of the big chain stores would welcomecompetition and the Co-troops., of course, will in general support us.15. The one thing that may unite these various elements in opposition to our proposals is the feeling that they will give a licence to extreme kinds of price-cutting. This feeling will certainly be fully exploited by the leadingprice-maintenance bodies and not only U.S.DAW. and the wobbling elements inthe opposition but many of the chain-store people and many managers andassistants of Co-op. stores will share it.16. My colleagues have already decided that the &quot;loss-leader&quot; argument assuch does not justify any elaborate qualification of our proposals and the reasonsfor that decision are set out in paragraphs 23-28 of the draft White Papers. i feel, however, that we ought not to rule out entirely the possibility of making some provision against the &quot; loss-leader.&quot; I have been looking at the legislation coveringthis topic in several of the United States and it seems to me that one device usedthere might perhaps be dropped here without compromising our objectives. SomeStates have laws which in effect prohibit sales by retailers at prices below theirpurchase price plus some token mark-up (e.g., 5 per cent.) to cover the barestminimum of costs (but no profit) of distribution. A provision of this kind in ourown legislation might have the effect of preventing the extreme kind of price-cut,which excites such horror even in people who would otherwise support us, while still giving ample scope for the competitive price-reductions which we seek toencourage.17. I do not, however, want at this stage to commit myself to any such provision. There are a number of difficulties about it which would have to be solved. Moreover, I would not say that it should necessarily be included in thelegislation as an immediate and general prohibition. There might be an enablingpower to introduce such a provision by Order, either generally or in particulartrades, if experience showed that, contrary to our expectations, extreme price-cutting was occurring. Alternatively, if we finally decided on a &quot; non-discrimina-tion &quot; provision, we might so frame it that the remedy against discrimination wouldnot be obtainable by a trader who sold below the level of cost plus the tokenmark-up.  I am merely suggesting at this stage that the possibility ought to be
properly examined and that, there might later on be advantage in having some such provision up our sleeves.18. It is for this reason that I have drafted the last part of paragraph 28 ofthe White&apos;Paper and also paragraph 44 in such a way that this type of provisionmight be thrown in the ring, if the reception our proposals get suggests that this might be expedient and if it proves practicable. I hope my colleagues will agree toretain these passages. .   ,Summary19. In this memorandum I have advanced various propositions to which invite the assent of my colleagues:  (a) We should not introduce a new name for the practice into the White Paperitself and should accept the conventional White Paper tone in which ithas been drafted.(b) We should accept the present balance between our economic argumentsand our objections to a private system of law.(c) We should not be more explicit in the White Paper on the &quot; retail-pricefixing &quot; and &quot; discrimination &quot; issues and should defer final decisions on these points until we reach the stage when legislation can be drafted.(d) We should indicate (in the terms of paragraph 43) our willingness to con-sider special claims for exemption.(e) We should indicate (in the terms of paragraphs 28 and 44) that somestatutory means of restraining extremes of price-cutting without com-promising our main objectives will be examined, if it proves necessary.20. On this basis I ask my colleagues to approve the draft White Paper for presentation to Parliament. In doing so, however, I must say that I do not shareany great enthusiasm which may be felt about these proposals. In part they runcontrary to the express and unanimous conclusions of the Lloyd Jacob Committeewhich we set up for the express purpose of studying this problem. They will giverise to pointed retaliatory criticisms of Trade Union restrictive and closed shoppractices-and of the methods used-for their enforcement. They will not, as faras I can ascertain, reduce the cost-of-living index or check its rise by more than a fraction of one point. I doubt whether they will confirm a single existing inclina-tion to &quot; Vote Labour &quot; they may cause increased antagonism amongst small shop-keepers. If they are (as they may be) the only proposal we can make for reducingthe cost Of living, they will cause disappointment. In short, they are, I am afraid,rather small beer.H.

-    &apos;   ANNEX &apos;A Statement on &quot;Resale price maintenance&quot;Being a trade practice which prevents shopkeepers from reducingcertain prices to the publicPART I.-A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PRACTICE,ITS OPERATION AND EFFECTS1. Resale price maintenance is a trade practice by which shopkeepersand dealers have to sell goods at prices laid down by the manufacturer orOther supplier and are not free to settle their own selling prices in the lightof their own circumstances. It is not known accurately how widespread thepractice now is; but it has been estimated that in 1938 about 30 per cent,of the public&apos;s expenditure on consumer goods was on price-maintainedarticles and it seems likely that this percentage has since gone up ratherthan down.2. The goods to which the practice applies are nearly always brandedgoods; conversely, most branded goods in this country are price-main-tained. (In the sense used here, branded goods are not simply goods markedwith the manufacturers name, since names are attached to many articles e.g., fashion goods which would not ordinarily be regarded as branded.Branded goods usually appear in a standard format bearing a distinctivetrade-mark or brand name. One manufacture may produce several differentbranded lines.)How Resale Price Maintenance Works3. There are two stages in the process of maintaining resale prices and preventing price-reductions by retailers. In the first place, the manufacturer(or it may be the importer or proprietor) of branded goods lays down theprices which he wants retailers to charge. (It should be noted that resale price maintenance does not involve price-fixing agreements between manu-facturers. In most trades resale prices are fixed independently for their owngoods by manufacturers who are in competition with each other.)4. The second stage is to see that the retailers comply with the resale prices laid down. This is sometimes done solely by the individual manu-facturer himself who may, for example, refuse to go on supplying a traderwho has failed to comply with his prescribed prices. In many trades, however,especially where goods normally pass through one or more middlemen before reaching the retailer, the job of seeing that traders comply with the resale prices fixed by manufacturers is done by a trade association.5. The collective enforcement of resale prices by trade associations is thesystem now in use for the bulk of price-maintained goods. These associa-tions are usually joint bodies of manufacturers and distributors, thoughhistorically the main impulse and initiative in setting them up and operatingcollective schemes has come from distributors.&apos; While some manufacturersundoubtedly see advantage to themselves in having the retail prices of theirbranded goods maintained, it is clear that, where a powerful associationexists in a trade, it may be hazardous for a particular manufacturer who hasno strong feeling in the matter to stand out against the wishes of the organiseddistributors.The Methods of Collective Resale Price Maintenance Associations6. The methods used by collective resale price maintenance associationsto enforce the charging of fixed resale prices and to prevent shopkeepers from making price reductions are described in great detail in Part II of the Reportof the Committee on Resale Price Maintenance (Cmd. 7696) and an extendedaccount of the way the practice works in the dental goods trade appears in chapters 4 and 5 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission^Report on the Supply of Dental Goods.7. The salient feature of most of these arrangements is the power ofthe associations to organise a boycott against a trader who reduces any ofthe prices which they seek to enforce. If a trader reduces the price of oneline of one manufacturer, his name may be placed on a &quot; stop list&quot; and hemay thereupon be unable to obtain supplies of a wide range of goods madeby other manufacturers, even though he may have scrupulously observedtheir resale prices. It will be evident that where the goods covered by theassociation^ activities form a large part of a trade, this type of boycott is equivalent to putting the victim of it out of business.
8. Another feature of many of these schemes is the great lengths towhich they go to prevent any type of price competition, direct or indirect.The dividend paid by the Co-operative Societies on their member&apos;s purchasesis often regarded as &quot;price-cutting&quot; and accordingly the Societies are unableto get supplies or can get them only if they undertake not to pay a dividendon the goods concerned. Often the trader must comply not only withthe manufacturer^ resale price but also with complicated arrangementsgoverning the sort of terms he may give in hire-purchase agreements, theprices he may allow for second-hand goods taken in part payment, thediscounts he may give to institutional and other large buyers and so forth.The Monopolies Commission^ Report on the Supply of Dental Goods showsthat one dealer was in trouble with the association in that trade because hesent out business reply envelopes to his customers and this was challengedas excessive and unfair competition.9. If a trader fails to observe any of these rules and regulations by whichthe associations seek to close any loop-hole in the operation of resale price maintenance, he may suffer penalties ranging in severity from fines (in somecases involving substantial sums) up to the boycott. (It is worth noting, too,that a trader who by charging too little for his goods incurs these penaltiesat the hands.of a trade association has no recourse to any higher authority;by contrast, a trader, who charges too much and is proceeded against by theState under price-control laws, can always appeal against a magistrate^decision to a higher court.) These penal proceedings, which may have theeffect of driving a shopkeeper out of his trade and which are directed notto the maintenance of a recognised standard or code of behaviour, generally accepted as necessary in the public interest, but solely to the enforcement of a particular trade policy of questionable merit, take place without anysupervision by the courts or by Parliament.The Effects of Resale Price Maintenance10. The prinicipal effect of resale price maintenance and the mainobjection to it is that it eliminates price competition from all trade in theprice-maintained goods. This is so, whether the prices are enforced by individual manufacturers acting alone or whether there is a collective enforce-ment scheme.11. There is plenty of evidence that the costs of trading vary considerably from one shop to another ; indeed, it is obvious that this must be so. Rentsvary with the position and age of shop premises. One shop carries a wide range of stock, runs an expensive delivery service and gives long credit;another concentrates on quick-selling lines and trades on a &quot; cash and carry &quot;basis. Both shops may serve the public well but it is clear that they areproviding two different kinds of service and that one costs more than theother. For every  1 of sales he makes, the first shopkeeper may spend 5s.in costs, whereas the second spends only 4s.; yet on all goods which areprice-maintained both shopkeepers must take the same gross margin of profitto cover these different levels of cost.12. In the Governmenfs view these differences in trading costs should be reflected in differences in prices to the public. Some people prefer to trade at ashop which delivers their goods and allows them credit. It is reasonable that,if this kind of service costs the shopkeeper something extra, they should pay for it in the prices of the goods. Other people are content with a lower stan-dard of service and if it costs less they should pay less. The Government areexpressing no view as to whether any one standard of service is &quot; better &quot; orsocially more desirable than another. They hold, however, that the public should have a free choice between different standards of shop service at different prices just as they have a free choice between different qualities ofgoods at different prices. This free choice is at present eliminated in a wide field of trade by the operation of resale price maintenance.13. It is often said that the practice does not prevent traders from com-competing in the services they give. But this begs the question. It is true that inorder to attract more customers a trader may increase the amount and quality of his service. But the potential customers may be comparatively indifferent toextra service, whereas they would be glad of the original amount of service ata lower price. It is this alternative which resale price maintenance stops thetrader providing. This has two important consequences. First, the resultmay be that more service is being provided in shops than people would want to pay for, if they had the choice of lessservice and lower prices; clearly we cannot well afford to wasteresources on services that are not wanted. Secondly, the result maybe to slow down improvements in the efficiency of distribution generally. Atrader who by improved methods achieves the kind of service which the publicwant at low cost should he imitated to the general benefit of his trade; butthe incentive to imitate and then outstrip his improvements does not existunless, by passing on the benefits of his enterprise in lower prices, he canattract customers away from the less enterprising.
Summary of the Governments Objections to Resale Price Maintenance.14. To sum up, the Government sees two main objections to the practice.First and foremost, it has the economic effect of stifling competition and of preventing shopkeepers from making price-reductions which they may be able and willing to make. Secondly, the methods of enforcement described aboveinvolve a private system of laws and punishment allowing no appeal to the established Courts of Justice. The Government holds that only overwhelm-ing reasons of public policy in favour of the practice could justify its continuancein face of these objections. In the next part of this White Paper the mainarguments advanced in support of resale price maintenance are examined.PART II-AN EXAMINATION OF THE CLAIM THAT resale price   MAINTENANCE   IS   NECESSARY   IN  THE   PUBLIC&apos; INTEREST    :A. Some Minor Arguments in Favour of the Practice15. Before coming to the main contention of the defenders of resale price maintenance, it may be useful to deal briefly with certain arguments in favourof the practice which are frequently advanced but which appear to the Govern-ment to be unsound and, by comparison with the objections set out above,trivial.The Public prefer fixed Retail Prices16. It is often stated that housewives like fixed retail, prices because they find it convenient to know in advance how much they will be charged forbranded goods. It is true that evidence which can be used to support thisview was given to the Committee on Resale Price Maintenance. It is, how-ever, difficult to believe that when housewives learned that goods which hadbeen on sale at (say) one shilling could be obtained in some shops for (say)elevenpence they would prefer to pay the higher price. (It is worth noting,too, that if this argument were right, traders could have nothing to fear fromthe &quot;price-cutting&quot; since the public would prefer to make their purchases atshops charging the full price.)Branded Goods must be Price-maintained17. Because it is habitual in this country to find branded goods sold ata common price in all shops, it is sometimes assumed that there is a necessaryconnexion between branding and fixed prices. This is not the case. In theUnited States for example, the popular brands of cigarettes are sold at differentprices by different classes of retailer. Smokers gain by this and there is no evidence that the manufacturers lose by it; in fact they have resisted pressure from distributors to have resale prices fixed.The Reputation of Branded Goods is Harmed by Reduced Prices18. It is argued that if manufacturers were to allow their branded goods to be sold at reduced prices, people would suspect that the quality was inferior.This is very doubtful : most branded goods are put up in a standard format.Few people would expect two bicycles of the same make or two copies of thesame book or two tins of the same brand of fruit or boot-polish to differ in quality merely because they were sold at different prices in different shops.In any event, so far as consumers are concerned, they could always pay thehigher price, if they so desired.Maintained Prices are &quot; Fair &quot;19. The Government accepts that the prices of many branded goods arenot excessive in the &quot; average &quot; shop. The point, however, is that no singleprice can be &quot; fair &quot; for all shops, since the services given and the costs oftrading vary from shop to shop. Different qualities of service should varyin price like different qualities of goods.Resale Price Maintenance keeps some Prices Down20. It is true that the resale prices fixed by manufacturers have in somecases been below what the goods would fetch in the open market in times of scarcity. Cigarettes and motor-cars are notable examples of this and it isnot denied that the policy of the manufacturers in preventing dealers fromexceeding their list prices has been of great service. Nothing now proposedby the Government, however, will prevent manufacturers from continuing to fix maximum resale prices in cases where they feel that it is in the publicinterest or in their own long-term interest for them to do so; The objectionto resale price maintenance is that it involves fixing minimum prices and preventing price reductions. The Government has no objection to fixing of maximum prices and, indeed, fixes maximum prices itself where statutoryprice control is necessary in the public interest.
B. The Main Contention; &quot;Unfair Competition&quot; and the&quot; Loss-Leader &quot;21. A more substantial argument in favour of resale price maintenanceis that price competition between distributors of branded goods is sometimesundesirable in itself. To a large extent it would appear that this argumentsprings from a dislike of competition as such and from a &apos;preference forrestrictionism and profit without risk. In so far as this is the feeling behind the argument, the Government can neither accept it nor take account of it.22. The Government recognises, however, that one element in this argu-ment is a sincerely held belief that price competition in retail trading inbranded goods inevitably leads to excesses and abuses which ultimately doharm to the manufacturer and the buying public as well as to distributorsthemselves and their employees. The Government expects that the maincriticism of its proposals in this White Paper will in fact be on the lines thatthey will have the effect of bringing back into the trades concerned the evils of &quot; uncontrolled price-cutting &quot; and the &quot; loss-leader.&quot;The &quot; Loss-Leader &quot; Argument23. The particular object of fear on the part of those who regard thecontinuance of resale price maintenance as essential is the &quot; loss-leader.&quot;This term is applied to a particular type of selective price reduction. A tradermakes a marked reduction in the price of some selected line of goods,perhaps even selling that line at a loss, in order to attract customers to hisshop in the hope that once there they will buy other goods bearing a fullmargin of profit. It is a form of advertisement and the extent of the price-cut in the selected goods may bear no relation to the trader&apos;s general level of costs.24. Nationally-advertised lines of branded goods are particularly apt foruse in this way because the public look out for them and can readilycompare prices from shop to shop, so that the &quot; loss-leader&quot; price-cut issure to be noticed. It is argued that when &quot;loss-leading&quot; becomes wide-spread, a serious instability is introduced into the trades concerned and thisultimately does harm to the manufacturers of those branded goods which are used as &quot; loss-leaders &quot; and to the buying public. It is said that when facedwith a &quot; loss-leader &quot; in their neighbourhood, other traders cease to stockthe line concerned. (They may also reply by &quot; loss-leading &quot; in some otherline, thereby spreading the practice.) The manufacturer finds that ordersfor the line fluctuate seriously and this may upset the steady flow of produc-tion and distribution on which the low costs of standardised branded goodsdepend. If &quot; loss-leading&quot; is very common, traders will also seek to sellmore unbranded goods or their own special brands, so as not to be caughtwith stocks of goods which are sold at cut-prices by competitors. Finally,it is argued that without an effective system of resale price-maintenance,&quot; loss-leading&quot; is bound to become widespread, bringing all these evils inits wake.The Government&apos;s View of this Argument25. The Government has given this argument the most serious considera-tion before deciding on its proposals, but has reached the conclusion thatthe fears expressed are exaggerated.26. In particular the argument fails, in the Governmenfs view, to take account of the differences in conditions between the years of deflation and unemployment in which the practice of resale price maintenance was built up and the present era of full employment and a high level of demand. Inthe former conditions sellers had to go to great lengths to tempt the public to buy. The Government does not,believe that in the absence of resale price maintenance extreme forms of price-cutting and other means of forcingsales would be likely in conditions of full employment to become a wide-spread or general feature of trading.27. Secondly, the Government believes that the argument to a largeextent assumes the existence of resale price maintenance and would cease to be valid in its absence. For example, a background of rigidly maintainedprices is just what the price-cutter needs to make his &quot; loss-leader &quot; tacticallyeffective. If it were general for prices to vary somewhat between different kinds of shop, no single price reduction would stand out in a spectacular way.Moreover, where variations in price are normal, it becomes impracticable fortraders to respond to a particular price-cut by ceasing to stock the line ofgoods concerned and pushing some competing brand instead. The assump-tion is that competing brands will also be reduced in price by some retailerswho can afford to sell at similar margins.28. Thus the Government is not disposed to accept the contentions which are based on past history and not on up-to-date experience that theabsence of resale price maintenance would inevitably lead to excesses andabuses of competition and that the price reductions which resulted would40653 c
disturb the production and distribution of branded goods. Should experienceshow that abuses do recur, it will be for the Government and Parliamentto deal appropriately with them. The Government will not be found unwilling to consider any reasonable proposal directed towards dealing with extremesor abuses of price competition as such, provided always that any such proposalcan be reconciled with the objective of allowing traders to fix their owriselling prices in reasonable relation to their own costs and trading policy.The Government is, however, firmly convinced,-that any. regulation of&quot; unfair&quot; competition that may in future be found necessary should beprovided by statute and should not be imposed by private associations,operating a private system of law and punishment and accountable to no onebut themselves...... &apos;PART HI.-STEPS ALREADY TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENTAND THE GOVERNMENTS NEW proposals the Lloyd Jacob Committee29. The Governments first step in dealing with resale price maintenancewas to set up in August 1947 a Departmental Committee under the chairman-ship of Mr. G^ H. Lloyd Jacob, K.C. (now Mr. Justice Lloyd Jacob) to inquire into the practice.30. The Committee reported in March 1949 and the report* was published on 2nd June, 1949. The Committee made three recommendations (cf. paras.163 to 167 of the Report) :  (a) No action should be taken which would deprive an individual producer of the power to prescribe and enforce resale prices for goods bearing-   his brand. - -ib) Producers are not entitled to use resale price maintenance to obstruct the development of particular methods of trading, to impede the dis-tribution by another manufacturer of competitive goods or to deprive the public of the benefits of improvements in distribution. - Public policyrequires adequate distribution of goods with provisions for such price reductions as are justified by low cost distribution or by a regular policyof distributing surplus profit to the customer. The appropriate Govern-ment Departments should invite consultations with the principalnational organisations in trade and industry to consider the most satis-factory means of ensuring that this policy is made effective.(c) Steps should be taken to render illegal the application of sanctions whichextend beyond the remedies open to an individual producer for any breach of resale price maintenance conditions.It will be noted that the second of these recommendations is in effect aqualification of the first.Collective Enforcement Schemes The Governments Proposal31. Despite the fact that the Committee&apos;s last recommendation-to makecollective sanctions illegal-^-was not qualified in any way, the government thought it right to give the manufacturers and traders concerned an oppor-tunity to discontinue these sanctions. The President of the Board of Trade, ina statement in the House of Commons on 2nd June, 1949, said that the evidencegontained in the report &quot; should convince manufacturers and traders that theirown interests, as well as those of the country, will be best served by freeingdistribution from the many self-imposed restrictions and controls described in the report.&quot; He added that he hoped that &quot; in the next few months weshall see industry itself taking steps to this end.&quot;32. A suitable interval was left for this purpose until in December 1949a letter was sent to all known collective price maintenance associations asking them whether they had taken or intended to take any action in the matter. it became clear from their replies that the associations generally intended to con-tinue their schemes-without modification. Subsequently, various pamphletswhich have been issued on behalf of the principal associations have shown thatthey still regard these schemes as being in the public interest. - There have alsobeen meetings between representatives of these associations and the Presidentof the Board of Trade but there has been no indication that any changes whichthe associations might now be,prepared to make would in any sense carry outthe intention of the Lloyd Jacob Committee&apos;s recommendation.33. The Government has concluded in the light of these facts that no adequate action is likely to be taken by the manufacturers and traders con-cerned ; and, having fully considered all the arguments that have been advancedon the subject, has decided that this recommendation of the Lloyd Jacob Com-mittee must how be implemented by legislation.* The Report of the Committee on Resale Price Maintenance, Cmd. 7696, London,H.M.S.O., 1949 (2s. 6d.). v
..... : ;.   The Government therefore propose ,to introduce legislation tomake illegal collective measures designed to ensure that goods shall be soldat (or above) specified retail prices...

Individual Pf0diietfs^)ixirxr ;0   lb; 35. The iiloyd Jacob Committee recommended that individual producersmight be left to operate resale pricemaintenancebytheirOwnmeans^but addedthat provision shouki be made &quot; for suchprice reductions as are justified by low-cost distribution Or;by a; regular policy of distributing surplus profit to the customer.&quot; They then recommended that the Government should consult theprincipal trade organisations to see how this proposal for a more flexible useof resale price maintenance by individual manufacturers could be effectivelycarried out. ...36. For this purpose the Government first approached the Federation ofBritish Industries and the National Union of Manufacturers and a meeting washeld on 24th October, 1949. Neither of these organisations felt able, however,to give any general guidance to its constituent associations on the subject. Itwas, therefore, necessary for the Government Departments concerned to approach individually the many trade associations which include among their members manufacturers who prescribe and enforce resale prices for their owngoods.37. Accordingly letters were sent in the early months of 1950 to a great many such associations asking them for their comments on the policy recom-mended by the Lloyd Jacob Committee and for any suggestions they mighthave for carrying that policy into effect. This approach, however, met with noconstructive response. Most of the Associations said that they did not concern themselves with their members&apos; activities in this respect and could offer themno guidance.. 38. Thus the situation is that the trade organisations concerned, while nodoubt accepting the first part of the Lloyd Jacob Committee&apos;s proposal (i.e. thatresale price maintenance by individual producers should be allowed to con-tinue), have not been able to suggest any means of carrying out the second part (i.e. that the practice should be operated with greater flexibility, so as toallow price reductions justified by low costs). The Government regards thesetwo recommendations as standing together and cannot accept a situation inwhich the first is fulfilled while the second remains a dead letter.39. In the Governmenfs view the economic objections to resale price maintenance are no less great when the practice is carried on by individuals(so long as they can operate it effectively) than when it is done collectively.For this reason the continuance of the practice would be acceptable only ifthe manufacturers concerned were able and willing to introduce the requireddegree of flexibility into its operation. The Government has decided there-fore that the necessary modification must be achieved by statute.The Governmenfs Proposal y40. The Government proposes to provide in the legislation to be intro-duced that manufacturers shall be entitled to indicate, recommend or prescribeonly maximum prices for the resale of their goods and it will be an offence to give any indication of resale price unless it is clearly stated that the priceindicated is a maximum.41. This means that the manufacturer will still be able to inform thepublic through advertisements and on wrappings of the maximum price atwhich they may expect to obtain his goods. The public will know that this price will not be exceeded and the manufacturer will be free to prevent-distributors from spoiling the market for his goods by charging a higher price.(The importance of this to manufacturers was stressed in paragraph 40 ofthe Lloyd Jacob Report). On the other hand, the trader will not be debarred from making a reduction from the indicated price and the Government will be^concerned to see that his freedom in this respect is not impaired.SUMMARY42.   To sum up : (a) The Governmenfs objection to resale price maintenance is two-fold.First, by eliminating price-competition between shops with different levels of cost, it prevents price reductions which could and shouldbe made. Secondly, the collective punitive action by which most fixedresale prices are enforced amounts to a private system of law whichin effect is outside the jurisdiction of the Courts.
(b) The Government will therefore introduce legislation to make illegal: (i) Collective arrangements designed to.ensure that goods shall be sold at or above specified retail prices.(ii) Any indication by a manufacturer or other supplier of goods of aresale price for those goods unless that price is clearly stated toi be a maximum price.43. Generally speaking the Government considers that this legislation should -have effect over the whole of industry and trade; but in drafting the legislation the Government will take account of any cases where it may beestablished that exceptional conditions would render the operation of theproposed provisions unworkable or undesirable in the public interest.44. In the Governmenfs view unfair or excessive&apos; methods of pricecompetition would be a matter for Parliament to deal with on its merits;fears of their possible emergence in the future cannot constitute a valid reasonfor allowing harmful restrictive practices to continue.
