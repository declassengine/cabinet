She was raised andtaken over by the Chinese Aliens Property Administration, was towedinto Hong Kong towards the end of 1948, where she has since been underrepair at a cost to the China Tanker Corporation of over Hong IU&gt;ng$8,000,000.     Following a dispute about payment for repairs her mooringsI were cut and she was towed out of the dockyard in a fog, when she wasintercepted by the Hong Kong Police.    An action was brought against hermaster for shifting her berth without permission and a fine of $100 imposed.An interpleader action by the Dock Company for direction as to custody andI ownership had to be withdrawn as the tanker wab no longer in theirpossession.    The vessel has now completed all the necessary formalitiesand has applied for towage to take her to Canton.2. By exercising administrative delays the Governor of Hong Kong hasarranged to defer her departure until after Monday, 2nd April. Thereafterhe cannot detain her further except by use of his Emergency regulations,which in view of the grave implications referred to below he is stronglyaverse from doing.    This vessel is, and will be claimed as, Chinese by the ^^^HChinese Peopled Government who are reported by His Majesty&apos;s Chargfed&apos;Affaires in Peking to be giving serious attention to the matter.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is most anxious thatthis tanker should not be allowed to pass into the control of the ChinesePeople&apos;s Government on the following grounds:-(a) that we should do everything possible to deny this valuable assetto the Chinese war potential in view of the fact that United Nationsforces including our own are at present engaged in resistingChinese aggression in Korea.    (Oil is a major shortage of the ^^^H|S       Communist forces and the supply of oil under British and ^^^HAmerican control to China has been embargoed without reper- ^^^Hcussions.)    The release of this vessel might evoke strong ^^^Hcriticism in this country. ^^^H(b) that there would be a very strong anti~British reaction in theI United States if the tanker were allowed to go to China, which ^^^Hmight seriously prejudice relations with the United States with ^^^Hrepercussions which might go wider than Hong Kong. 1-
? (c)    that the effect would be to antagonise the United States stillfurther against Hong Kong, and jeopardise any chance of arelaxation of the United States embargo on exports to theColony.4. The Secretary of State for the Colonies takes the view that:-*(a) action to detain the tanker which is admittedly Chinese property,would be regarded by the Chinese People&apos;s Government as anunfriendly act (going as it would far beyond any such measures ^^^Has the embargo of goods under Lists I and II, etc.); ^^^H(b) that in doing so we should be detaining property in which a_HI| Government whom we have recognised is interested;(c) that to do so would be to invite reprisals against British shipping ^^^Hin Chinese ports.    (No ships of major importance are reported _mmHto be there at present, but it would make it far too risky for them ^^^Hto go there in future.    There were, however, 20 smallerBritish ships in Chinese ports in the weekending 27th March and _^^H24 proceeding to or from those ports.); ^^^H(d) 1 that reprisals against Hong Kong by the Chinese People&apos;s Govern- ^^^HI ment are probable.    These might take the form of cutting off ^^^Hessential food supplies from Hong Kong, which cannot be re- ^^^Hplaced, and of stirring up internal unrest in Hong Kong itself. ^^^HAt the best it would be one more nnail in Hong Kong&apos;s coffin&quot;; ^^^H(e) that once the vessel leaves Canton (whether it can be towed from ^^^HHong Kong without leaving territorial waters) it should be ^^^Hpossible for the Nationalist Government or the United States ^^^HNavy to intercept her. ^^^H5. The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of Transportsupport the view of the Secretary of State for the Colonies particularly as ^^^Hregards the dangers of reprisals against Hong Kong and British shipping ^^^Hin Chinese ports. ^^^H6. The Minister of Transport has, in addition to calling attention to ^^^hthe possibility of retaliatory action against British ships in Chinese ports, ^^^hurged the very serious danger to His Majesty&apos;s Government, in view of ^^^htheir very large shipping stake in world trade, of being the first to embark ^^^hon a policy of high-handed interference with ships, since to do so might set ^^^hthe pattern for similar action not only by Russia and her satellite nations, ^^^hbut also elsewhere, with very far-reaching consequences.    Apart fromquestions of morals it is to our interest, as the leading maritime power, ^^^hto set an example of rectitude in this matter. ^^^hm The Governor of Hong Kong has been consulted and has said thatweighing up the certainty of American reactions with their serious con-sequences (which will probably occur in any case) against the lessercertainties of Chinese retaliatory action (but with its far graver conse-quences) I should prefer to incur the displeasure of the Americans as the ^^^hlesser of two evils&quot;, ^^^h-2-
II I8. From the legal aspect it is agreed that by placing a broad ^^^flinterpretation on the Hong Kong Emergency regulations, the vessel couldbe detained thereunder.    But the Governor of Hong Kong, in all the cir- ^^^Hcumstances, is not prepared to use his powers under these regulations^^11 except on specific instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government to do so,nor could the Government of Hong Kong be expected to meet any reasonablecost for maintenance, depreciation or other charges which might ariseout of the vesselfs detention and which would therefore have to be borne byHis Majesty&apos;s Government.9. In view of the resolutions concerning Korea which have been ^^^Hadopted by the United Nations, the Foreign Office Legal Advisers considerthat there would be little difficulty in justifying the detention of the vessel ^^^Hunder international law.    However, this would amount of the exercise of ^^^Ha quasi-belligerent right and therefore, since such rights have not so farbeen exercised outside the immediate sphere of hostilities in Korea, a new ^^^Hdeparture of policy is involved. ^^^H10. The issue is one of major importance and the decision of theCabinet is accordingly sought: ^^^H(a) whether the Governor should be instructed to use his Emergency ^^^HPowers to detain the vessel in Hong Kong, and, if so, ^^^H(b) whether His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to meet costs ^^^Harising out of the detention of the vessel as specified in ^^^Hparagraph 3 above. ^^^HHI3Qth March, 1951.
