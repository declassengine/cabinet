-     98THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE   PROPERTY   OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.3 1CP. (51) 8719th March, 1951CABINETAPPOINTMENT OF A SUPREME COMMANDER ATLANTICMemorandum by the Prime MinisterAt the meeting of the Cabinet on 12th March, I undertook to circulate forthe information of those of my colleagues who are not members of the DefenceCommittee a statement of the case for the appointment of an American officer as supreme Commander Atlantic.2. The idea of appointing a single Supreme Commander for the north atlantic Ocean has been under discussion since the earliest days of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation. Although it was a matter in which all the twelveN.A.T.O. Powers had a legitimate interest, it was one in which we and the UnitedStates were clearly fair more concerned than any other country. discussions between ourselves and the Americans have accordingly been proceeding on a service level over the last two or three years. At a very early stage after the birth of N.A.T.O. it was agreed by all twelve nations on a similar level that theSupreme Commander should be an American officer. In subscribing to thisdecision, the Government were acting in accordance with the clearly expressedviews of the Chiefs of Staff. Further discussion centred on such questions as the location of his headquarters (finally decided in favour of Norfolk, Virginia), theorganisation of the command and the precise responsibilities which the supreme commander should exercise. On this latter point there was never any disagree-ment as to the Supreme Commander&apos;s responsibilities in a broad sense, but certaindetails have been under discussion. In particular we have been at some pains toensure that the Supreme Commander&apos;s responsibilities in peace-time should belimited to planning and to the supervision of combined manoeuvres and that responsibility for basic training in the Royal Navy should remain with the BritishAdmiralty.3. In October last year the results of these discussions were crystallised ina report submitted to the Defence Committee of N.A.T.O., and approved by them at their meeting in Washington. The decision having been taken that the supreme commander should be an American officer, it was then for President Truman to nominate an individual. This he has now done. We in common with the othermembers of N.A.T.O. have been asked for our approval and we have given it.4. Once the appointment has been formally agreed it will remain for theSupreme Commander to build up his staff.5.  In spite of the very clear statements made by myself in the House of* Commons on 26th February and by the First Lord of the Admiralty in the Houseof Lords on 1st March, it is obvious that there is still a good deal of misunder-standing about the organisation of N.A.T.O. and the way these commandappointments fit into it.6. In the first place there seems to be a widespread belief that while general eisenhower has been appointed Supreme Land Commander the Supreme Com-mander Atlantic will be a Supreme Naval Commander. This is a misconception.The truth of the matter is that the whole of the area covered by the North atlantic treaty Organisation is to be divided geographically. General Eisenhower willbe the Supreme Commander Europe. As his main problem will be the defence of40309
2Western Europe against land attack, the greater part of his forces will be land forces. But he will also have under his command considerable air forces and somenaval forces.  Another geographical area will be the North Atlantic Ocean.   Itso happens that this area consists almost entirely of water and it therefore seems(, improbable that the Supreme Commander will have much in the way of landCs forces under his control.  In fact the vast bulk of his forces must obviously benaval forces.   But there will in addition be important air forces placed at his1 disposal. For example, we might well place under his command that part of R.A.F.Coastal Command which will be allocated to the defence of shipping in the atlantic.7. The North Atlantic Ocean area will be divided into various sub-areas, ofwhich much the most important will be the West Atlantic and the East Atlantic.The forces allocated to the former will be under the operational control of an american Commander-in-Chief; those in the East under a British Commander-in-Chief. Coastal waters on both sides of the Atlantic will be entirely outsidethe Supreme Commander&apos;s control.8. Criticisms of the appointment of an American officer as supreme commander Atlantic have often taken the extreme form of a statement that theBritish Home Fleet will be under the command of an American Admiral. Strictlyspeaking we can place as few or as many of our naval forces at the disposal ofN.A.T.O. as we choose. It is for us to decide what contribution we are to make.Nevertheless, too much should not be made of this point since it is, in fact, ourpresent intention to contribute the greater part of the Home Fleet. The important point is that by doing so we shall not be completely abdicating control over ourown forces.9. The precise form of his command organisation will be largely a matter forthe Supreme Commander himself. It is, however, certain that he will have a deputy Supreme Commander who will be a British Naval Officer. It can alsobe taken as certain that this country will be strongly-represented on the supreme commander&apos;s staff; and it is important to remember that the Supreme commander and all his staff will be integrated, international, N.A.T.O. officers owing no directallegiance to the countries from which they happen to come.10. There will, however, be attached to the Supreme Commander&apos;s head-quarters a British Liaison Officer (probably a British Admiral) whose function itwill be to represent the British view to the Supreme Commander and vice versa.11. It is also important to note that the Supreme Commander will not inoperational matters be a law unto himself. He will be acting in accordance withdirectives issued to him by the Standing Group. The Standing Group is a bodysituated in Washington and consisting of representatives of the United States,United Kingdom and France. The British representative at the moment is lord tedder. These three represent the views of their respective Chiefs of Staff and arein fact extensions in Washington of those Chiefs of Staff. In peace-time theyare responsible for planning, and in war-time, they would be responsible for thehigher strategic direction of the War. The&quot;se responsibilities have been delegated to them by the Military Committee of N.A.T.O., which consists of the Chiefs ofStaff of the twelve N.A.T.O. nations. Lord Tedder, of course, although an R.A.F.officer, represents in his capacity as a member of the Standing Group all three ofthe British Chiefs of Staff. Technically, indeed, it is the Chiefs of Staff themselveswho are the members of the Standing Group. It is obvious that they cannotnormally exercise this function when they are 3,000 miles away, but they could doso at any time if they wished and upon occasion have done so.12.  It is to be remembered, too, that Lord Tedder has available as advisers *a senior officer of each of the Services in the Heads of the Joint Services Mission;the Head of the Naval Mission is a full Admiral. ^__13. There are thus several safeguards against the possibility that the supreme commander will arbitrarily dispose of British forces in a manner contrary to ourwishes or interests:  (a) We can make our views known through the British Liaison officer at his headquarters.(b) The Supreme Commander will take his orders from the Standing Group.
(c) The British Chiefs of Staff will be aware of orders issued to the Commander-in-Chief Eastern Atlantic and can ensure, through their representation on the Standing Group, that these orders.do not conflict with their views.14. There is the further important point that, so far as N.A.T.O. is concerned,the Standing Group are the legitimate heirs and successors of the Combined Chiefsof Staff, whose extinction has been so much lamented. They differ from the combined Chiefs of Staff only in that they include French representation.15. Much has been made of the perfection of the war-time system of command in the Atlantic and of the undesirability of departing from it. It is therefore worthwhile recalling what actually happened during the war. In the early days britain was the only Power fighting the German U-boats in the Atlantic and we had full control of operations in the whole of that Ocean. Later on, in 1941, the UnitedStates entered the war and the natural thing to do was to draw a line north andsouth down the middle and for them to take over responsibility for the westernhalf. The arrangements for ensuring co-ordination of operations in the Atlanticwere of a rudimentary character and there were many occasions when the need for something more speedy and effective was felt. It is precisely this speed andflexibility which it is hoped to gain by the appointment of a Supreme Commander.These advantages could not be secured by retaining separate commands for theEastern and Western Atlantic co-ordinated by the Standing Group, a body whichis not organised to exercise responsibility of that kind. Those who had highresponsibility for anti-submarine operations in the last war have said that theexistence of a Supreme Commander would certainly have reduced shipping losses.16. The advantages which would accrue from the establishment of a supreme allied Command Organisation in a future war can be considered under thefollowing headings:  (a) Economy of Force.(b) Unity of Operational Control.(c) International Co-ordination.Economy of Force17. With a single command we achieve the ability to make use of the flexibilityinherent in Naval and Air forces. Wherever a concentrated threat arises, a concen-trated defence can be moved to meet it. If the enemy spreads his attack thinlythroughout the ocean so, too, can the defence be spread.Unity of Operational Control18. If the Atlantic Ocean were divided into a number of areas, each underindependent national commanders, this would lead to lack of flexibility and dividedcontrol. There would, for instance, be no operational organisation for co-ordinating the forces in different national areas. Co-ordination could take place only atStanding Group level and procedure would of necessity be too slow to meet opera-tional requirements, particularly in emergency.International Co-ordination19. The control of the Atlantic is not only of vital importance to thiscountry but it is also the life-line of Allied forces operating in Europe, to which the americans plan to make a considerable contribution, and of our European Allies.In the last war there were only three nations involyed, United Kingdom, UnitedStates and Canada. In future the countries which will contribute forces and/orbases for the defence of the Atlantic Ocean will be: the United States, UnitedKingdom, Canada, Netherlands, France, Norway, Portugal, Denmark and Iceland.In view of the large number of nations concerned, it is considered that co-ordina-tion of operational matters by committee is quite out of the question and thatan overall commander is necessary to co-ordinate their efforts.20. It may be asked, however, why the Supreme Commander should neces--sarily be an American.21. In the first place it is essential to be realistic and to recognise that theworld situation in regard to naval power has changed a great deal in recent years.We are iaccustomed to think of ourselves as primarily a great naval Power witha long tradition of naval supremacy.  But it is only sensible to recognise that the
United States Fleet now outnumbers our own by about three to one. Unless wecan ensure the unstinted help of those resources we cannot hope successfully tofight another battle of the Atlantic. The appointment of an American officeras Supreme Commander is the best possible guarantee that the full resources of theUnited States will be thrown into the defence of our sea communications. Muchhas been made of the danger that the Supreme Commander might divert british forces from the East Atlantic to the West Atlantic. The much greater likelihoodis that an urgent need will arise to divert American naval forces from the West tothe East; and there is little doubt that this is likely to be achieved more easilyand more speedily under an American Commander than under a british commander. Moreover we need naval reinforcements from outside the atlantic area altogether. If so they can only come from the United States Navy, and a united States Supreme Commander would clearly be in much the best positionto obtain such reinforcements quickly. It is well to remember that the greatestnaval threat will probably be in the Eastern Atlantic and North Sea. This isthe area where we particularly desire a British Admiral in command at sea intactical control. His fleets will be mostly British ships reinforced as necessary by such American ships as may be placed at his disposal by the supreme commander. Thus in fact the main defence will be conducted by a british admiral which is what we especially desire.22. It must be. remembered too that this is a case where the wishes and interests, not of two Powers, but of twelve, have to be taken into account andtheir agreement obtained.23. It is not a new thing for British naval forces to be placed under an american Supreme Commander. Our Fleet in the Pacific in 1945 served to thegeneral satisfaction under Admiral Nimitz.24. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is a bold, novel conception fromwhich we hope and believe great advantages will flow. We have always made itclear that it would mean some pooling of sovereignty, and here is a case where we must make some small sacrifices for our own and the common advantage.C. R.
