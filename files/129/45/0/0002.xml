introduction. This is the fifth in the series of annual Economic Surveys. When thefirst was published in February 1947, the prospect was extremely serious.The country was in the throes of an acute fuel crisis; production was furtherimpeded by severe shortages of steel and other key materials and by transportbottlenecks arising mainly from deficiencies in rolling-stock ; there was alarge and rapidly widening gap in the overseas balance of payments, particu-larly in the dollar balance, and as a result the American and Canadian loanswere fast draining away. The main theme of that Survey, and of the threethat followed, was the need to keep inflation in check at home so that theUnited Kingdom could establish its balance of payments on a sound footingand achieve a reasonable standard of living that would nofbe dependent on external aid. The particular requirements each year were more and more efficient production, mbre exports and the maintenance of a high level of investment; for these requirements to be met it was essential that claims for personal consumption should be limited, and the importance of wage anddividend restraint and increased savings has therefore been a constant themeof the Survey.2. Since 1947, with the help of Marshall Aid, great progress has beenmade along the road marked out in the Survey, and by the end of 1950 itcould fairly be claimed that the immediate task of post-war recovery was completed. Thanks largely to a steady rise in productivity, the volume ofindustrial production last year was some 30 per cent, greater than in 1947,and with the notable exception of coal, and to a lesser extent of generating capacity, the most serious of the shortages which affected industry four yearsago had been successfully overcome. At the same time, the volume of exportshad been raised to over 60 per cent, above the 1947 level, and as a result theUnited Kingdom managed in 1950 to attain a surplus of  189 million on itsoverseas balance of payments, in contrast to a deficit of  558 million in 1947.In assessing this change, however, it is important to note that the UnitedKingdom&apos;s stocks of food and raw materials were run down to a considerable extent during 1950 because world scarcities developed ; if imports had come up to the levels intended, last year&apos;s surplus would have been substantiallysmaller. Nevertheless, a striking improvement did take place in the externalbalance, and this was accompanied by the transformation of the sterling area&apos;s sold and dollar position from a deficit of $4,131 million in 1947 to a surplus of S804 million in 1950.3. The fruits of these achievements were to be seen last year in every aspect of the nation&apos;s economic life. Its productive equipment had been extended and modernised, in some industries almost beyond recognition. personal consumption had been raised by 5 per cent, or so above the 1947 level,though supplies of meat and sugar both remained well below pre-war. Theshortage of housing was still acute, but the number of new homes providedsince the war had risen to over a million. At the same time there had beena great extension of the social services.4. These were in themselves substantial gains, but the real significance ofthe progress made since 1947 lay in the fact that at the end of 1950, for thefirst time since the war, the United Kingdom was fully solvent and fullyindependent of outside aid. The fundamental maladjustment in the balanceof payments inherited from the war had in large measure been overcome,and the gold and dollar reserves stood at a higher level than at any timefor more than ten years. This is not to say that the pre-war position wasrestored. Tha reserves were in real terms worth only about one-third oftheir value in 1938 ; no more than a start had been made in rebuildingthe country&apos;s overseas assets which had been so heavily reduced to pay for the war; and there still remained a huge burden of overseas indebted-ness amounting at the end of 1950 to over  3,500 million &quot;(compared with 760 million in August 1938). None the less, the basic strength of the economy was such that the Government felt able to agree to the suspension of Marshall Aid from 1st January, 1951.5. The economic recovery of the United Kingdom during the past fouryears bears eloquent testimony to the generosity of the American people and the constructive statesmanship of their leaders in launching the european recovery Programme. Without the aid received under that programme andfrom other members of the Commonwealth, the United Kingdom would bein no position today to undertake an additional burden of rearmament andthus play its full part in the defence of the West. As it is, this task will entail heavy sacrifices and the postponement of many new comforts whichmight otherwise have resulted from the labours of recent years, but unhappilythere appears to be no other way of safeguarding our security and our inde-pendence. The Soviet Government has for long pursued an aggressive andintransigent policy towards the free world, and its huge armies are a menace to us all. Not until the Communist leaders have been convinced that theWestern Powers are impregnable may we hope to be able to concentrate once more on peaceful development.
CHAPTER IIMPACT OF REARMAMENT10. At its peak in 1944 the United Kingdom&apos;s defence expenditure exceeded 5,000 million and accounted for well over half the national income: in 1948and 1949 it had been reduced to about  750 million. Up to this time theServices were still able to rely largely on wartime stocks of equipment, but in1950, even before large-scale rearmament became necessary, provision had had to be made for greater production. Total defence expenditure has nowto be raised at a rapidly increasing rate from  830 million in the financialyear 1950-51 to  1,300 million projected in 1951-52 and over  1,600 million in 1952-53. Altogether, during the three years beginning in April 1951, the rearmament programme announced by the Prime Minister in his statement in the House of Commons on 29th January (Cmd. 8146) provides for a totalexpenditure, including civil defence, but excluding stockpiling, of about  4,700million. These figures are based on present prices, with allowance only forsuch price increases as can already be foreseen with certainty. Table 1summarises the main statistics.6. The execution of a greatly enlarged and accelerated rearmament pro-gramme has now become the first objective of the Governments economic policy. It cannot, however, be the sole objective. The potential military strength of this country depends upon a well-equipped industrial system, a healthy population at home and an order balance of overseas payments. Itis above all vital that nothing should be done that would seriously impairour capacity to export the goods and services needed to pay for the importsupon which our livelihood depends. The export trade is indeed an indis-pensable foundation of the whole economy, and the failure of exports wouldhopelessly weaken the United Kingdom and frustrate its efforts to defenditself.7. The problem therefore is how to rearm as fast as. we can, while main-taining a strong and healthy economy. The second objective implies norejection of the sacrifices or reversal of the drastic measures needed for thefirst. Rather the opposite. It means indeed that we must not seek tolighten the burden of rearmament by measures which would mortgage thefuture. Exports must therefore, as far as possible, be protected. some particular types of exports are bound to be adversely affected by defence production, but the aim must be to make up for any such losses and indeed more than make up for them by increasing exports of other things.Home investment too needs to be maintained at a high level, and we mustmeet more of the cost of rearmament by sacrificing for the time being the improvements we had hoped to enjoy in the standard of living and indeedcutting it back somewhat below its present level. Only in this way can there be any assurance that, if all goes well and the rearmament of the West securesthe peace we seek, this country will still retain the strength and independencepainfully recovered in the last few years.8. This will be a hard task, for we have to meet a huge new demand upon our resources at a time when there are almost none unused, when there are almost no spare men and no spare capacity to call upon. Moreover, this claimmust be met here at a time when other nations are engaged upon exactly thesame task. In particular, the giant economy of the United States is beingswitched over to arms production on an enormous scale. The resultingincrease in world demand for raw materials&quot; has produced conditions of wide-spread scarcity and soaring prices, which have greatly aggravated our ownproblems of raising output and preserving financial stability at home. Theshortage of raw materials is indeed much the most serious of all the difficulties with which the United Kingdom is likely to be faced in the immediate future.9. Formidable though the problems are, this country is much betterequipped to tackle them than at any time since the war, and in putting forward this survey of the prospects for 1951 the Government is confident that all the obstacles can be successfully overcome. At the same time thecourse of economic affairs in the months ahead must depend to a considerable extent upon decisions by Governments in other countries and upon the out-come of international negotiations in progress at the time this survey is published. For these reasons, it is at many points impossible to make a simple forecast of what will happen, and many of the quantitative statements which will be found below are therefore tentative and conditional. But theroad ahead is clearly marked, even though we may be uncertain how fastwe shall be able to travel.
11. Of the three-year total, some  2,800 million is attributable to produc-tion of arms, equipment and clothing, to works and buildings, and to research and development. The remainder includes such items as the pay and pensions of the Services and of their civilian employees, the movement of personnel and stores, and supplies of food, petrol and oil.12. A large part of the production total is required from industries makingengineering and other metal goods. Production of engineering and metal goods for defence is expected to increase from about  165 million in 1950-51to about  360 million in 1951-52, with a total of  1,650 million for the threeyears 1951-54. Of the  360 million to be spent in the first year, aircraft willaccount for roughly one-third, vehicles for one-sixth, shipbuilding and marine engineering for one-sixth, and radio and radar equipment for one-thirteenth.There will be very big increases over the three years in productionof combat aircraft arid tanks, while large sums will also be spent on thebuilding and conversion of naval vessels, on anti-aircraft and anti-tankweapons and ammunition, and on radio and radar equipment. Among other things this will mean that there will have to be a large increase in employ-ment in existing aircraft factories and Royal Ordnance Factories, which havehitherto been wofking below their full capacity. Substantial new capacity willalso have to be quickly created for the production of tanks and aircraft in later years.13. While the impact of rearmament will be heaviest on the metal-using industries, both the Services and civil defence will also be making consider-able new demands on production of textiles for clothing of all kinds, webequipment, blankets, groundsheets, tents and so forth. These demands willfali with particular severity on the cotton industry.14. Expenditure on works and buildings for defence purposes will risevery sharply in the early stages of the programme, from just over  80 million in 1950-51 to  145 million fn 1951-52 ; for the three years 1951-54 the totalis expected to be about  475 million. The extra work will include thecreation of more factory space for arms production, extension and improve-ment of airfields, bringing disused airfields back into use, provision of addi-tional storage capacity, development of the Control and Reporting system and improvement of anti-aircraft defences.15. The additional production and building work just described accounts for nearly two-thirds of the projected increase in defence expenditure duringthe first year of the programme. Most of the remainder of the increaserepresents the cost of maintaining and supplying the larger Armed Forces,including provision for the higher rates of pay introduced in September 1950.16. At the beginning of April 1950 there were 713,000 men and women in the Forces. As a result of improved recruitment and the extension of theperiod of military service the total is expected to rise to rather over 800,000by 1st April, 1951, and to about 870,000 by April 1952. This increase, comingat a time of very full employment, will make it more difficult for industryto find the labour it needs, but even so the total number of persons in civil employment will probably rise slightly. The calling up of reservists for short periods for training next summer will unavoidably cause some difficulty for industry, but every effort will be made in its administration to avoid seriousinterference with essential work.17. The above totals make no allowance for expenditure upon the accumula-tion of strategic stocks of food and raw materials. Provision of  140 million is being made for this in the financial year 1951-52, but we cannot by any means rely on sufficient supplies being available for all this money to be spent.18. The United Kingdom&apos;s defence programme is designed to cover itsworld-wide commitments, but so far as the defence of the West is concernedit is part of the much wider plans for the defence of the West being under-taken by the twelve North Atlantic Treaty Powers(1), and some adjustmentsmay prove necessary as their joint planning progresses. Discussions arenow taking place between the twelve Governments on the size of the collective defence effort required and the best ways of sharing the burden, and it will be some time before the outcome of these discussions is known. Meanwhile theUnited Kingdom is pushing ahead with its own programme, but it needs to be emphasised that this programme cannot be carried out in time without sub-stantial imports of machine tools from overseas, and these are not yet assured.Many of the tools needed can only be obtained from the United States andthe Continent of Europe, since certain types are not made in this country,and the capacity of the British machine tool industry is inadequate to meet all the new demands. Orders for some of the components and other items in the programme are also being placed in Europe.(&apos;) The North Atlantic Treaty was signed on 4th April 1949. Associated witn the UnitedStates and Canada in signing this Treaty were the five Western Union Powers Belgium,France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and in addition Norway,Denmark, Italy, Portugal and Iceland. These twelve powers set up the North Atlantic treaty organisation to help them carry out their joint undertaking &quot; to restore and maintain thesecurity of the the North Atlantic area &quot;.
19. All but a small proportion of the increased defence expenditure of thenext three years will make a direct call upon physical resources. There arein principle four ways in which these resources could be obtained: first,through an increase in total production ; second, by the withdrawal of resources from the production of consumption goods and services at home ; third, atthe expense of the production of investment goods-houses, factories, plant and machinery, and the like ; lastly, through allowing a deterioration in the overseas balance.20. It is obvious that the first of these courses would provide the happiestsolution to the problem. This could happen either if there were many idleresources or if the productivity of the resources already employed could be improved. The former is, of course, precisely the way in which a re-armamentprogramme would be carried out in a country with heavy unemployment and much unused industrial capital. The civilian economy would not suffer ;the cost of defence would be met by reducing previous waste. This was, infact, how the United Kingdom&apos;s rearmament was in the main conducted inthe late 1930&apos;s. Today, however, we have neither the unemployed labournor the empty factories that would be needed for this to be possible again.21. Alternatively, is there any possibility that the existing labour force could provide the extra production required by increasing output per head?There would then be no-need for any accompanying reduction in presentconsumption and investment levels. The only sacrifice incurred would bea sacrifice of improvements that would otherwise have come about. the striking increases in productivity that have been almost the rule in Britishindustry in the last three years would, at first sight, make this appear areasonable hope today, for the increase in defence production is of the same order of magnitude as the increases in output which past productivity trendswould suggest for the next two or three years. Unhappily, however, as thediscussion below makes clear, raw material difficulties make it unlikely thatin the years immediately ahead productivity can continue to improve so fast as recently.22. Moreover, the problems ahead are not solely problems of aggregateoutput. The increased claims of defence are not distributed evenly over the economy, but are largely concentrated upon particular sectors most of allupon the metal-using industries. The great bulk of the output of these industries goes to home investment and exports and only a very small partconsists of consumption goods. This makes it much more difficult to shiftthe main burden of re-armament on to consumption. It is indeed certainthat defence orders must to a considerable extent displace the production of metal goods for export and investment, and it will be a major task forGovernment and industry in co-operation to ensure, not only that the arma-ments are produced in time, but also that the other output displaced is ofthe least important kind.23. The Government does not consider that these problems can be dealtwith by giving an over-riding priority to arms production. Experience duringthe war here and in other countries has shown that this is an ineffective and dangerous instrument in times when all resources are greatly strained. Itmay sometimes be better that a firm should continue production for exportor investment than that it should undertake a particular defence contract which some other firm, though perhaps less experienced in this type of work,could carry out efficiently and in time without displacing essential production.The Government has made arrangements by which advice can be given to industry when such clashes of urgency arise, but no hard and fast rules canbe laid down. It is a matter rather where each case must be judged on itsown merits, and much will be learnt from experience.24. Wherever necessary, formal controls and powers of direction over pro-duction will be used. Scarcities of materials have already made it necessaryto impose a number of controls to ensure that an adequate part of limitedsupplies is made available for defence and vital export and investment uses.These controls cover both allocation and limitation and prohibition of end-uses and are mentioned below. Further measures have been planned andwill be carried out if they come to bi needed. Factory and storage spacewill be requisitioned where necessary.25. Physical shortages and the needs of arms production will inevitably lead to a reduction in exports of coal, metals and some metal goods. At atime when the cost of imports is rising with alarming rapidity, this gravelythreatens the balance of payments. The Government is resolved that theUnited Kingdom&apos;s external accounts must not run into deficit during the re-armament period. To prevent this, the level of other exports must be raised.In particular, a new export drive by the textile industries is called for, andmany other smaller industries producing consumption goods must also play their part. Targets are now being worked out and will be announced assoon as possible after discussion with the industries concerned.
CHAPTER IIPROSPECTS FOR OUTPUT27. The prospects for output in 1951 must depend in the first place uponsupplies of manpower, fuel and power, steel and other raw materials, and each of these is discussed in turn in the paragraphs that follow. The likelytrend of industrial productivity as a whole is then examined in the light ofthis discussion, and the chapter concludes with a review of the prospects for particular industrial groups the metal-using trades, building and civil engineering, textiles and agriculture.Manpower28. During the war the total working population (in the sense of all those at work or offering themselves for work) was considerably increased. Inthe struggle for national survival many older persons who would otherwise have retired stayed on, and many women left their homes for work in factories and on the land. When war came to an end, the old pattern was partlyrestored, though many more women remained in industry in the new condi-tions of full employment. Between June 1945 and June 1948 the maleworking population declined by over 300,000 and the female by 1,000,000 a fall in three years of about 6 per cent, in total, part of which is accountedfor by the raising of the school-leaving age. Since then there has been avery gradual rise amounting to about \\ per cent.29. The total will probably continue to grow during the next year or so,but there is,no prospect that it can be forced to grow much faster than ithas recently, short of pressures or compulsions entirely unacceptable in peace-time. Nevertheless, something can be done to encourage more people togo to work, particularly those who are unable to work the normal factoryday. Hours of work can in suitable cases be adjusted to allow more womenwith domestic duties to work in industry. Special arrangements can be madeto retain the services of the elderly and the disabled.30. Nothing much can be expected from further reduction of unemploy-ment, which remains far below what was in the past considered a practicableideal. With an average of oniy about \\ per cent, of employees out of work,a large proportion of those registered as unemployed are simply moving fromone job co another. Nevertheless, it may be possible to reduce the totalfurther by still more effective use of the Employment Exchanges. To thisend, the employers&apos; organisations have recently agreed to recommend the advance registration of redundant workers at the Exchanges, so as to shortento a minimum the period between jobs. Significant pools of unemploymentpersist only in the Development Areas and a few other places. The Govern-rnent is continuing its policy of encouraging new industry in these areas, andthe enlarged defence programme will offer opportunities of helping further.31. In general, therefore, national output cannot be much assisted in thenext year or two by increased employment. When account is taken of the increasing numbers serving in the Armed Forces, civil employment is expectedto be practically constant, while the number available for the production of civilian goods will, of course, decline. Recent trends and forecasts are shownin Table 2. The forecasts of unemployment are particularly uncertainbecause so much, will depend upon supplies of raw materials.32. It is against this background that the labour problems of rearmamenthave to be considered. Rather less than half a million workers were esti-mated to be engaged on the production of munitions and equipment in themiddle of 1950. While no exact calculation can yet be made, it seems likely that the new defence programme will require this number to be more than doubled when it is running at its highest level in 1953-54. This transfer will26. The defence programme, the drive to increase exports of consumer goods and the rise in import prices (with its inevitable effects upon the cost ofliving) are together serious threats to financial stability. If incomes and prices get out of control, not only will much social injustice be caused, butmunitions production and exports will be obstructed. The policies described above must therefore be supported by an appropriate fiscal and monetary policy. The Governments intentions in this matter will be announced inthe Budget, but some of the underlying problems are discussed in a pre-liminary way in Chapter IV of this survey.
often mean no more than that the nature of the work being done by theexisting labour in existing factories is changed, or that the Government takesproducts previously sold to private purchasers. In so far as this is so, no serious labour problem is involved But in certain engineering industriesthere will have to be an increase in the total labour force in existing plants ;for instance, about 175,000 additional workers are estimated to be requiredfor aircraft factories and Royal Ordnance Factories in the course of thenext two years. In addition, some new capacity, especially for jet aero-engines and tanks, will need to be manned. In the shipbuilding and ship-repairing industries the effect of the defence programme, together with therecent increase in commercial orders, should be to arrest the decline in thelabour force that would otherwise have taken place over the next few years.33. There will not therefore need to be so much movement of labour fromone job to another, or from one place to another, as a figure of over half amillion extra workers for defence production might suggest. When the pro-gramme gathers momentum, substantial movements will be necessary, butthe more immediate problems are likely to be of a detailed character. local shortages of labour may develop in certain areas, and in the early stages oneof the most difficult problems facing industry as a whole is likely to be find-ing the highly skilled workpeople, such as draughtsmen and jig- and tool-makers, who will be urgently needed to prepare the production lines for defence contracts.34. The employment problems of rearmament cannot be considered in isolation. Much will depend on how successfully pressure of civil demand is kept in check. Much also will depend upon the extent of raw materialshortages and the measures taken to reduce their impact on essential work.In some cases the allocation of scarce materials and control over output will make it impossible for particular firms to keep their existing labourfully and usefully employed. Release of labour under such circumstances will help in providing workers needed for defence production, so long as itis in the right areas and the labour is of the right type.35. The Government intends to keep in close consultation with both sides of industry on the general situation, and on particular problems as they arise.Special attention is now being given to the labour requirements of defence work in the engineering industries. The system of labour preferences isbeing operated by the Employment Exchanges in order to place workers,so far as possible, in jobs of special importance where their skills will be fully used. Encouragement is being given to schemes of training, up-gradingand dilution, and these will be supplemented by training in government training Centres on the lines that proved successful in the last war. Industryis also being urged, where appropriate, to consider the introduction ofsystematic overtime. For the present, these measures jeem likely to be adequate, but if it appears later that exceptional measures are necessaryto ensure adequate supplies of labour, the Government will not hesitate to take them.Coal[Note. The following paragraphs on coal ha e been submitted by the Ministry of fuel and Power. There has been no opportunity for these to be discussed inter-departmentally before printing ; this will be done, however, before the draft isconsidered by Ministers.][36. Since the beginning of 1951 manpower in the mines has continued the increase which began in the previous November when a stop was put to the downward trend which had been in operation for nearly two years.The actual increase in the first eight weeks of the year amounted to 11,500,and the numbers are still going up. After an initial setback, due largely to an outbreak of influenza, attendance has also improved, and, this, withthe greatly extended Saturday working, has led to an increase in the average number of shifts worked weekly. In the same period output per manshiftwas about 3 per cent, higher than in the corresponding weeks in 1950. the combined effect of these factors has been to secure an increase in deep-minedoutput of 1&quot; 1 million tons (3 -1 per cent.) over the level of the previous year.][37. It is hoped that, in general, conditions will remain favourable duringthe summer, but. owing to the many doubtful factors involved and, inparticular to the doubts regarding the future movement of colliery manpower in the face of the growing demands of the re-armament industries, it isnot possible at this stage to forecast the out-turn of the year as a whole.This is however not of great importance, since the outlook for the winterdepends largely upon the level of stocks built up during the previous summer.Subject to the qualifications noted above, it is expected that, this summer,total coal supplies will amount to about 108 million tons (deep-mined, 101million tons ; opencast, 7 million tons). Inland consumption has been pro-visionally estimated at 95 million tons, if the average temperature this summer
11657 Economic Survey Galley 8 continued ../&apos;is that of a normal year. This would represent an increase of 3-5 million tons (3-8 per cent.) over actual consumption last summer. The mainincreases expected are for power stations, gas works, coke ovens and generalindustry. In addition, it is proposed to make some increase in the provisionfor house coal over last summer&apos;s level.]       ji[38. It is essential that by the end of the summer total distributed stocksshould amount to at least 18 million tons and that, if possible, they shouldbe brought up to 20 million tons. It is expected that, at the end of thepresent winter, stocks will amount to between 9 and 10 million tons. Itis proposed therefore to provide for a stockbuild of at least 8-5 million tons during the summer and, if circumstances prove favourable, to increase thisprovision by 2 million tons, in order to secure the full 20 million tons stocktarget. Provision has also to be made for exports and bunkers at substantially the same level as during the present winter (4-5 million tons).]Electricity41. Thanks in the main to the achievement of a better balance betweensupplies of different types of equipment, the net increase in electricity generating capacity in 1950 was much the largest on record no less than965,000 kilowatts, compared with the previous record of 759,000 kilowattsin 1938. In 1950, for the first time, installation of new turbo-alternatorsexceeded a million kilowatts. Nevertheless, new plant coming into service during the year was not enough to offset the growth of demand, and inspite of measures to spread the load shedding was frequent during the winter months. New construction is proceeding well, and a steady increase incommissioning is therefore to be expected in 1951, but peak demand duringthe winter is likely to remain in excess of maximum generating capacity forsome years to come.
Other Raw Materials45. The industrial output of the United Kingdom is dependent upon theimport of vast supplies of raw materials of every kind. Reductions or dis-turbances in the flow of world trade in these materials can imperil the entireeconomy. In the past five years the danger has been that we could not pay for the materials needed to support our rising output: today it is rather thatthe required supplies cannot be found.46. Industrial demand for raw materials everywhere was already high and rising in the summer of 1950, and even before rearmament began consumptionof a number of commodities was outstripping production. The world-widerearmament drive has imposed heavy new demands, both for current armsproduction and for strategic and commercial stockpiling. This has greatlyaccentuated the shortages and has driven up the prices of many raw materials.One result has been a rapid extension of public controls over raw materialexports by countries anxious to conserve indigenous supplies. Thus, in common with other countries, the United Kingdom is finding great difficultyin obtaining its requirements of a wide range of materials. The most dangerous shortages at the present time are of sulphur and sulphuric acid,zinc, and copper. Past consumption figures for these and other main materials are set out in Table 5.47. The scarcity of sulphur is without doubt the most threatening of all.Sulphur and sulphuric acid are consumed either directly or indirectly in almost every industry in the United Kingdom. While the largest single consumersare the fertiliser and rayon industries, sulphuric acid is also vital to a great many important processes in the rubber, chemicals and metal industries. TheUnited States produces about 95 per cent, of the world&apos;s natural sulphur(i.e. pure sulphur, as opposed to sulphur-bearing compounds such as pyritesand anhydrites) and provides almost the whole of the United Kingdom&apos;imports. In 1950 this country consumed some 460,000 tons of natural sulphur,of which 105,000 tons were used directly in industry and 355,000 tons were used to manufacture sulphuric acid. The acid made in this way providedsome 55 per cent, of our total requirements.Steel42. The output of steel ingots and castings rose from 15.55 million tonsin 1949 to 16.29 million tons in 1950, thus exceeding the forecast of 15.75to 16 million tons given in the Economic Survey for 1950. The figures are set out in Table 4. Imports of steel, approximately 454,000 tons, were about half the 1949 level. Deliveries of finished steel to the home market were about 10.2 million tons, though there are some indications that actual con-sumption may have been somewhat higher than this. Exports (includingtinplate) rose from 1.7 million tons to 2.35 million tons. During the first half of the year home supplies were generally in balance with demand,except for sheet and tinplate, production of which cannot increase until newfinishing capacity is completed ; in these circumstances it was possible toabandon the allocation of &quot; general steel&quot;. In the second half of the year the position changed: demand hardened, and by the end of the year mostorder books were full up for months ahead.43. Capacity for iron and steel making will increase in 1951, and it isestimated that 16.75 million tons of ingot steel could be produced if fullsupplies of raw materials were available. Unfortunately, however, suppliesof raw materials (especially imported scrap and rich iron ore) are not likelyto be adequate to keep capacity fully employed. It would accordingly be unwise to rely on a crude steel production of more than 16 to 16.25 million tons, and even this may prove to be an optimistic assumption unless- the drive to recover home-produced scrap is pressed ahead with the utmostvigour. Further, imports of steel may fall below the 1950 level because of increased demand abroad. Considerable quantities of steel will begin to berequired for the rearmament programme in 1951, and though these will notnecessarily all be a net addition to demand, the total requirements of thehome market will increase. It will therefore be necessary to reduce exportsbelow the high rate achieved in 1950.44. Difficulties may arise over the supply of special types of steel such asalloys. As for sheet and tinplate, the new mills at Margam and Trostre willstart up in the second hall of 1951 and are expected to produce some130,000 tons of sheets and some 40,000 tons of tinplate this year. Un-fortunately, because of threatened limitations on crude steel production, theimprovement in supplies of these products will probably be to some extentat the expense of production of other categories of finished steel.
48. The shortage of natural sulphur stems from the imposition by theUnited States of export controls designed to safeguard its diminishing sulphurreserves. In the first quarter of 1951 the United Kingdom received an alloca-tion of just over 80,000 tons ; against this, requirements were estimated at112,000 tons, after allowing for a saving of some 50,000 tons a year as aresult of a cut in super-phosphate production of about 300,000 tons a yearimposed in 1950. The allocation represents a reduction in supplies of 28per cent, as compared with 1950, and a severe system of rationing has con-&apos;sequently had to be introduced. As a temporary measures supplies to mostusers of sulphur as such have been cut by 30 per cent, of their consumptionduring the period from April to August last year, and to most users ofsulphuric acid made from sulphur by 33 per cent. The reduction of suppliesof regular sulphur for the manufacture of carbon bisulphide (mainly used forrayon) and for the rubber industry was confined to 15 per cent. If additionalsulphur is not forthcoming, it will be necessary to introduce a more detailedsystem of rationing.49. Additional plant for the production of sulphuric acid from materialsother than imported sulphur and for extending the recovery of by-productsulphur has been under construction for some time. These projects and fresh schemes are being given a very high degree of priority, but they cannotbe expected to yield large amounts for at least two years.50. Several of the non-ferrous metals are scarce at the present time, butthe most serious shortage among the major metals is that of zinc. This isparticularly unfortunate in that zinc is one of the most versatile of metals andhas played a big part in the recent rapid increases in the productivity of theengineering industries, especially through the development of the techniquesof die-casting. In 1950 the United Kingdom consumed 240,000 tons of zinc.Of this, 137,000 tons were imported as metal from Australia, Canada, Norway,Belgium and the United States, and in addition 70,000 tons were produced at home from imported concentrates ; the balance was met by calling onstocks. As far as can be seen at present, supplies in 1951 will fall con-siderably below last year&apos;s level. This has made it necessary to introducedetailed control. In the last quarter of 1950 supplies to all consumers were reduced to 75 per cent, of their 1949 consumption, and on 1st January, 1951,more detailed allocations were made, ranging from 50 per cent, of the rate of consumption in the first nine months of 1950 for galvanising to 80 per cent,for die-casting. The average allocation was 65 per cent. From 1st March,1951, the use of zinc (as well as of copper and alloys of these metals) in themanufacture of many &quot; inessential&quot; products has been prohibited altogether.51. Copper, also now scarce, is one of the basic metals of the general engineering industry. It has a very wide range of uses proper to itself, ofwhich the most important are in the making of electrical wires and cables,and many more when mixed with zinc to make brass. During 1950 theUnited Kingdom consumed some 330,000 tons and imported some 295,000tons, mainly from Northern Rhodesia, but also from Canada, the UnitedStates and the Belgian Congo. The deficit was met from stocks. It may notbe possible in 1951 to obtain as much copper abroad as in 1950, and we cannot longer afford to run down stocks. In this case too, therefore, it has been necessary to introduce a system of rationing, and at the present time con-sumers are receiving allocations 15 per cent, below their rate of consumption in the first halt of 1950.52. Many other raw materials are causing difficulty. American cotton isvery scarce owing to poor crops and the statutory reduction of cotton acreagein the United States last season. Consumers in the United Kingdom havehad their supplies of this growth reduced to 50 per cent, of their 1949-50consumption and are substituting other growths as far as practicable. Arelated scarcity, also very serious, is that of cotton linters, which are used in industries as diverse as rayon, plastics and surgical dressings.53. Supplies of aluminium, nickel, wool and softwood are also scarce.Restrictions have been placed on the consumption of all of these except wool,and with the growth of defence requirements the position may deterioratefurther. A long-term contract for aluminium has been negotiated with canadian producers which will secure an additional 50,000 tons of metal inthe second half of 1951 (making 200,000 tons for the year as a whole) andensure an annual supply of 220,000 tons in 1952 and 1953. For softwood toocontracts have been placed both by private importers and the Gcvernmentwhich should lead to steady improvement in future.54. The world scarcity of raw materials is having, or threatening to have,serious consequences, not only for Ourselves, but also for all other industrial countries. While domestic action may mitigate the worst effects of individualshortages, satisfactory remedies can in many cases only be found by inter-national action. The United Kinacom has been in the forefront in seekingsolutions to these problems. the Prime Minister discussed them with president Truman during his visit to the United States in December last year,and as a result of these and other discussions the United Kingdom, the UnitedStates and France joined in establishing the International MaterialsConference.
Industrial Productivity in 195157. With these serious problems of material supply before us, can pastproductivity trends be expected to continue? Table 6 shows employment and output indices for recent years in summary form. From these it can beinferred that, very roughly speaking, productivity in the industries coveredby the Interim Index manufacturing, mining, building and public utilities has increased by an average of 7 per cent, a year during the last three years,while for manufacturing industries alone, on which the direct burden ofdefence production mainly falls, the increase has been even greater.58. A great deal more is involved in this question than the supply of rawmaterials. Until recently it had been feared that these very rapid increases were due to factors connected with the transition from war to peace whichwould soon become much less important. The process of post-war recon-version must obviously now be complete. Most arrears of maintenance and replacement in industry have been worked off. Many technical advancesheld up during the slump and war years have been generally adopted. all this might be taken to imply that the easiest gains in productivity mustalready have been secured. Indeed, in the Economic Survey for 1949, it wassuggested that those processes must have come to an end in 1948. But the record shows that such arguments were misleading. Productivity since hasincreased as fast or faster.   How is this to be explained?59. Technical advance continues unflagging. Never have greater effortsbeen made in scientific and industrial research, public and private, than to-day. Never have employed and employers been more alive to the needs and opportunities for improved organisation and technical training, a par-ticular tribute being due in this connecton to the work of the Anglo-AmercanCouncil on Productivity. Again, full employment and an absence of sellingproblems have made it possible for manufacturers to plan for long runs, andthey and their workers have both abandoned some of the restrictive habitsof thought inherited from earlier years. The rate of investment in plant and machinery remains very high, and though, as will be shown below, somediminution appears inevitable, this in itself is not likely to have serious results in the short period. There seems therefore little reason to believe that therecent record of improvement could not be maintained. Were we assuredover the next two or three years of adequate material supplies from overseas,the prospects for British output would be excellent.60. As has been shown, it is impossible at present to make any exactforecast of the supplies we are likely to be able to obtain in the next year or so. But even if such a forecast could be made, this would not in itself enableaggregate output to be predicted with any accuracy. There are two reasonsfor this, First, the switch-over of many factories to defence is bound to entailtemporary dislocations to the flow of output.    There will be delays for55. This organisation has invited the major producers and consumers of critical raw materials to take part in international commodity committees.These committees will &quot; consider and recommend to Governments the specificaction which should be taken in the case of each commodity in order to expand production, increase availabilities, conserve supplies and assure themost effective distribution and utilisation of supplies among the consumingcountries.&quot; The first commodity committees have already begun their work.Copper, zinc and lead are being discussed in one group, molybdenum andtungsten in another, manganese, nickel and cobalt in a third ; their are separategroups for cotton, wool and sulphur. The results of their work will not be known for some time. Further groups may be formed very soon. While theGovernment hopes that this country will get relief in some critical cases, it isconscious that the problem before the free world is extremely difficult,and that shortages of materials for civil use must be faced in the interests bothof our own defence production and that of our allies.56. The United Kingdom is also taking part in examinations of this problem in the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation and the north atlantic Treaty Organisation and is maintaining close contacts with theother members of the Commonwealth. The shortage of raw materials cannotbe regarded merely as a transitory problem associated with rearmament.Greatly increased supplies of nearly all the main materials, or of substitutesfor them, are going to be required in the future in a world of high employ-ment and rising industrial activity, particularly when Germany and Japan get back into full production. Economy measures therefore will have to bemaintained over a long period, and it would be a mistake to look upon them as short-term expedients only. Furthermore, it is of the utmost importance that new sources of raw material supplies should be developed as rapidly aspossible. The United Kingdom, in consultation with other members of theCommonwealth, is giving the closest attention to this question in the convictonthat world demand for most materials is likely to press hard upon supplies for many years to come.
tooiing-up, and an initial accumulation of unfinished work throughout thefield of defence production, which will interrupt the recorded flow of output.In part this factor is merely statistical the earlier slackening of output beingbalanced by an apparent acceleration when the finished products are recorded but in part it represents a genuine loss of, productivity, a genuine cost ofswitching industry from one pattern of output to another.61. Secondly, there is no simple quantitative relationship between materials and output: Plentiful or less scarce materials can be substituted for those that are very scarce. Specifications can be altered and, of course, are beingaltered all the time. Many improvements in technique and design consistin making fewer materials do the same work. The rising cost of raw materialssharpens the normal incentive to the discovery and adoption of such improve-ments, beside stimulating the recovery of waste materials and scrap. Further,apart from such changes, the same rise in costs will tend to shift demand away from articles containing much costly materials towards those made with less.62. Thus skill and imaginative effort can often prevent the shortage of aparticular imported raw material from having anything like a proportionateeffect upon output, and the Government makes a special appeal to industry at this time to exercise the utmost ingenuity in finding means of economisingscarce materials. This is a matter in which formal controls are difficult,cumbersome and costly. The Government must rely to a large extent on tncvoluntary efforts of consumers.63-, It is in the light of these conflicting factors that forecasts of produc-tivity have to be made, and it is obvious from whait has been said that anysuch forecast must be most uncertain at the present time. The future trend of produotivity must depend above all upon what raw materials are availableto manufacturers. For the purposes of this survey it has been assumed that production in the industries covered by the Interim Index will be 4 per cent,higher in 1951 than in 1950. Since production in the last quarter of 1950 was already about 4 per cent, above the average for 1950 as a whole, a 4 per cent,increase in 1951 implies no more than the maintenance of the end-1950 level.This increase is less than could have been hoped for, had it been possible to rely on adequate material supplies. Equally, it is more than would at presentappear likely if the levels of imports of sulphur, cotton, zinc, copper and otherbasic materials at present in prospect cannot be improved upon. The differencebetween the rate of progress of the last three years and what may be realised in1951 and 1952 must be regarded as part of the cost to us of our own andothers&apos; defence preparations.The Metal-Using Industries64. The metal-using group of industries covers a very wide range of inter-related activities, including all kinds of engineering, shipbuilding and themanufacture of electrical goods, road and rail vehicles, aircraft, precisioninstruments, jewellery, cutlery, hollow-ware, metal furniture, drop forgingsand brassware.(&apos;) In 1950 these industries produced goods valued at about 2,400 million, providing about two-fifths of all United Kingdom exports andthe great bulk of the plant and machinery used for home investment. Now,in addition, they will have also to produce large quantities of arms, at atime when shortages of materials must inevitably hamper the further growth of their production.(&apos;) In this context the manufacture of iron and steel and non-ferrous metals is excluded.65. The output of these industries has expanded rapidly since the end ofthe war, as the figures in Table 7 show. In 1949 it was already some 40 percent, greater than in 1946, and there was a further increase of no less than10 per cent, in 1950. In the first two or three years after the war the risein output was mainly explained by the reconversion of the metal-using indus-tries to peacetime work, but more recent increases have been largely attribu-table to improvements in productivity made possible by a freer flow of rawmaterials and by large expenditure on development and re-equipment.During the past two years new plants started since the war have been cominginto production in increasing numbers.66. Supplies of steel and non-ferrous metals are likely to set the effectivelimits to output in 1951, and in the light of what is already known about these supplies there seems to be no hope of production increasing anything like as much this year as last. It certainly cannot be expected to rise abovethe level achieved in the last quarter of 1950.67. Significant changes will have to take place in the pattern of output fromthese industries as a result of rearmament. New capacity will have to be created for certain types of engineering production,, and in particular for themanufacture of jet aero-engines and tanks, though this cannot affect output for some time. A more immediate change will be the further manning of aircraft factories and Royal Ordnance Factories hitherto working below their
full capacity. A considerable part of the new arms production will, however,be provided by firms whose capacity is already fully employed. In somecases it will be necessary for such firms to defer work on other orders sothat they can turn dver, in whole or in part, to more urgent defence work.Double or treble shift working may also require to be undertaken.68. One of the most, difficult problems arising from rearmament will bethe supply of machine tools. The re-tooling of existing plant and the creationof new capacity will together involve an expenditure of over  100 million onmachine tools during the next two years. United Kingdom output of metal-working machine tools in 1950 was valued at  40 million, of which about two-fifths was exported. Even after allowing, for the greatest practicablereduction in exports and expansion in production, it is clear that many ofthe machine tools needed will have to be imported. Orders have now beenplaced, or will be placed shortly, in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden,Switzerland and the United States. Discussions are taking place with theUnited States Government about the granting of priorities for orders placedthere.69. During 1950 the shipbuilding industry received orders for 1.6 million gross tons of new merchant shipping, and at the beginning of 1951 thetonnage under construction and on order amounted to 3.4 million tons somewhat more than at the beginning of 1950. Orders for over a million tons came in in the first two months of 1951, and in addition a substantial volume of new naval construction is in hand or on order. The shipbuilding industry now has sufficient orders to keep it fully occupied until at least theend of 1953, although there are some small firms whose prospects are not so definitely assured. Roughly two-thirds of the merchant shipping tonnageunder construction and on order is for United Kingdom owners.70. The ship-repairing industry has overtaken the arrears of maintenance work on merchant ships which accumulated during the war, and reconver-sions of ships used for special war services have been almost completed. Theindustry has thus virtually reverted to what can now be regarded as thenormal peacetime level, and there is no reason to suppose that there will beany major changes in the level of activity over the next two or three years.71. A larger proportion of the capacity of the motor-vehicle industry willhave to be devoted to defence production to meet the increased demand forsome tank and aircraft components as well as for non-fighting vehicles forthe Services. Production of motor vehicles has been increasing rapidly inthe past few years, but this expansion has been checked by raw materialshortages. Supplies of sheet steel had to be reduced in the first quarter ofthis year to 15 per cent, below the level of the last quarter of 1950, mainlyas a result of a reduction in supplies from the United States. Short-time working has become necessary, and home supplies of civilian vehicles willhave to be curtailed if exports are to be maintained. The allocation of newcars to the home market has therefore been reduced from 110,000 in 1950to 80,000 in 1951, and there is to be a corresponding fall in home suppliesof commercial vehicles from 105,000 to 80,000.72. Home supplies of many durable consumer goods produced by the metal-using industries will also have to be reduced. The radio industry, for instance,is being called upon to raise its production of radio and radar equipment forthe Services in the first year of the new defence programme to more thandouble the 1950-51 level. A number of firms now making durable metalconsumer goods will be required either to switch over themselves to defenceorders or to release labour for such work elsewhere. In addition, the Govern-ment is taking direct action to restrict supplies of metal consumer goodsthrough allocations of scarce raw materials and through the limitation orprohibition of less important end-uses. Certain specific uses of zinc, copperand their alloys were prohibited from 1st March, though up to the end of Junefirms are allowed to use their stocks of semi-fabricated and partly-processedarticles.73. Of the total output of the metal-using industries last year, about two-fifths was exported, just over one-third used for investment at home and theremainder divided between defence, consumption and other uses. If a moderate increase in output can be achieved in 1951, while supplies  or civilian consumption are reduced, it should be possible for these industries*tomeet the additional claims of rearmament without seriously reducing total supplies available for export and investment. Exports of some particularproducts such as machine tools will, however, certainly have to be reduced.The aim must be to make up for these losses by increasing exports of othermetal products, so that the total volume of exports from the group in 1951is at least maintained at the 1950 level. This will, of course, be lower thanthe level reached at the end of 1950, and indeed a steady decline may beexpected in the rate of export during 1951, as arms orders go into production.As for supplies of plant, machinery and vehicles for home investment, thereis, likely to be some reduction in 1951, but no precise estimate can vetbe given. J
Building and Fixed Investment74. The building and civil engineering industries account for well over half of all fixed investment at home. The size of the labour force on con-structional work has remained very stable during the last three years. Therehas been nevertheless a steady, if moderate, increase in the amount of work done. The evidence is that productivity has increased by some 4 to 6 percent, a year, an improvement that may be attributed both to the industrysettling down after the rapid expansion of the immediate post-war yearsand to wider realisation of the need for greater efficiency both by manage-ment and workers. Because of this improving productivity and of generalprogress in the economic position last year, it was possible to relax somewhatthe further restrictions on investment imposed after the devaluation of sterling.Within the total of building investment there was a fall in the resources devotedto repairs and maintenance and a substantial increase in new buildings.75. Material supplied should be sufficient in 1951 to enable building output to go on rising at least as fast as in recent years, but the defence programme will have a considerable impact on the industry. It provides for an increasein expenditure on works and buildings for defence purposes (including indus-trial building) from just over  80 million in 1950-51 to  145 million in 1951-52 -an additional demand somewhat greater than the likely increase in total output. Furthermore, there is a serious shortage of architects, quantitysurveyors, draughtsmen and other works staff, and defence building is likelyto interfere with some types of civil work which require these particularskills.76. Investment in building is subject to licence or authorisation, and theGovernment can therefore control the use of building resources. But the planning and execution of most building works take a considerable period,and to be effective the control of investment programmes must look far ahead. The investment programme for 1951 was prepared and approved in1950, and account was then taken of the probable increase in the total output of the building and engineering industries. Much of the work allowed for in this programme, particularly that to be carried out in the early partof 1951, was licensed and, in some cases, even begun during 1950. Thismeans that, if the requirements of the defence programme are to be met, itwill not be enough merely to postpone the granting of licences for new civil work. The regional machinery which fixes starting dates for approved build-ing work will therefore be used to give priority to specific defence projects asthey come forward, the start of other building in the localities concerned beingdeferred where this is necessary to avoid overburdening local building resources.77. Gross fixed investment for civil purposes in 1950 is estimated at  2,176million, compared with  2,120 million in 1949 (Table 8). A reduction willbe necessary in 1951, and therefore some of the programmes both for buildings and plant and machinery which were originally approved in anticipation,of an increase in the total will not now be carried out on time. The total investment programmes for 1951 and 1952 are being re-examined, and until this examination is complete, it will be impossible to say how large the cuts,will be, or where they will fall. It is not intended to reduce the housing programme as a whole, but there may be some interference with the com-pletion of local programmes.Textiles78. Further expansion of production was recorded in all the main sectionsof the textile industries in 1950. Table 9 shows that the increase was mostmarked for rayon: it amounted to 48 per cent, over 1949 for staple fibre,16 per cent, for continuous filament yarns, 38 per cent, for spun rayon andmixture yarns, and 20 per cent, for rayon cloth an mixtures. Productionof cotton cloth expanded by 6 per cent, and of wool cloth by 2\ per cent.Exports of woven wool piece-goods were larger than in 1949 owing to animprovement in the last half of the year. Exports of cotton piece-goods fell,mainly as a result of reduced trade with the Colonies. Exports of linen piece-goods rose from 39 million to 49 million square yards, and almost all theincrease went to North America.79. The outlook for 1951 is clouded by prospective raw material shortages,which will almost certainly lead to a reduction in output in some parts of theindustry. Rayon production, for instance, is dependent on sulphur, suppliesof which have been drastically reduced in the first quarter of the year. Pro-duction of nylon, however, should at least be maintained in 1951, and inaddition there should be small quantities of other synthetic textile fibres,production of which is now beginning.. The world shortage of raw cotton,particularly American cotton, will continue at least until the 1951 crop
Agriculture82. The agricultural expansion programme launched in 1947 made sub-stantial progress in 1950, despite a poor cereal harvest in the Western partsof the country. The programme was designed to raise output by 1952-53to roughly 50 per cent, above the 1936-39 average ; in 1949-50 output was39 per cent, higher than the latter figure, and in 1950-51 it should turn out at over 40 per cent, higher. Table 10 gives the main developments. It willbe seen in particular that the output of livestock and livestock products hasbeen increasing rapidly. This expansion has been largely the result of greaterproduction and fuller use of our grasslands, with better conservation of the product; the quantity of silage made in 1950 was double that of the previous year.83. The outlook for 1951-52 is chequered. As the result of a wet autumn and winter, crop acreages in 1951 may be lower than in 1950, particularly for wheat. Defence requirements and raw material shortages are bound tohave some impact. For instance, the call-up of agricultural workers is beingresumed, although those who register for National Service this year will notbe taken until after the harvest. Owing to the shortage of sulphuric acid,the production of super-phosphate fertilisers has had to be reduced, and supplies may be scarce.&apos;84. Shortages of sheet steel and zinc, together with defence demands uponthe engineering and building industries, are likely to affect the supply of farm equipment and to slow down investment in agricultural machinery and,in some areas, investment in new form building and improvements. Thisis bound eventually to have repercussions on the rate of increase of agricul-tural output as a whole. It may also make it more difficult for farmers toswitch from one line of production to another, thus interfering with the desired transfer of resources to meat production. Again, while the supplyof imported animal feeding-stuffs is at present just adequate, there may be difficulties for the future because of the large proportion of the total supplywhich comes from uncertain sources.85. In spite of these handicaps agricultural output should increase furtherover the next year or two. There is a good deal of natural momentum inthe excellent expansion recorded over the last few years. The developmentof the use and conservation of grass should continue; new and improvedvarieties of crop plants, both home-bred and imported, are replacing olderand less productive types; there are important developments in the controlof weeds, insect pests and plant diseases; supplies of most fertilisers shouldbe fully maintained, and despite higher costs  usage of fertilisers has risenand become more efficient; the stock of farm machinery should increasefurther, even if not as rapidly as hitherto ; and there is still a steady rise inmilk yields, reflecting better management, improved breeding, increased con-trol of cattle disease and more adequate nutrition. It will be the chief task of the agricultural industry over the next year or two to make the mostof these favourable trends and possibilities.becomes available in the United States, and very probably longer. Produc-tivity in the cotton industry is likely to be adversely affected by changes inthe methods of production arising from the shortage of American cotton andof rayon staple fibre, and from proportionately increased use of other types of cotton. The scarcity of raw wool has led to very high prices, and less istherefore likely to be consumed this year than last. Some part at least ofthis fall in wool consumption should be made good by increased use ofrecovered wool, and some lowering of the quality of cloth may help tolessen the reduction in yardage which might otherwise have occurred.80. Little increase in volume can be expected in exports of yarns if suffi-cient supplies are to be retained for further processing at home. The burdenof achieving the required expansion in exports will therefore fall on piece-goods and made-up clothing, and these do not so readily secure an entry into some overseas markets as yarns. Nevertheless, while it may not prove possi-ble to achieve more than a moderate increase in the volume of textile exports,textile prices have generally advanced by very much more than the average for prices of semi-manufactures and of finished goods. Textiles, and particu-larly wool goods, should therefore earn appreciably bigger returns in foreign exchange.81. Shortages of raw materials, increased defence orders and the drive to expand exports must lead to some reduction in supplies of textiles to thehome market in 1951. However, since a substantial part of the deliveries to the home market in 1950 appears to have gone into stock, the quantitiesof most kinds of cloth and clothing available to the public in 1951 may notbe much less than the quantities actually bought in 1950 ; and the con-siderable further increase in prices can hardly fail to reduce demand some-what below that of 1950.
CHAPTER iii the BALANCE OF payments the General Problem86. In 1950, for the first time since the war, the United Kingdom achieved a balance of payments position which, in its broad outlines, could be regardedas reasonably satisfactory. The overall balance of payments showed a surplusof  189 million the heaviest figure for thirty years, and an improvement of 227 million on 1949 and over  700 million on 1947. The gold and dollaraccounts of the Sterling Area showed a surplus of  287 million, compared withdeficits of  381 million in 1949 and  1,024 million in 1947. Assisted byreceipts under Marshall Aid, the gold and dollar reserves increased by no lessthan  575 million, considerably more than the associated rise in short-termliabilities (Table 11). This strengthening of the external financial positionof the United Kingdom and of the other Sterling Area countries in the courseof 1950 made possible the suspension of allotments of Marshall Aid from 1st January, 1951, and the termination of drawings on the Canadian credit of 1946.87. In the course of 1950, therefore, the objective of the E.R.P. programme was reached, and the economy of the United Kingdom ceased to depend uponexternal financial assistance. It is the intention of the Government that this state of affairs should continue during the period of the rearmament pro-gramme. Reference has already been made to the discussions which are now proceeding in N.A.T.O. in order to provide for an equitable distribution ofthe economic burden of defence. Because of these discussions, and because ofthe rapid changes which are now in progress, it is impossible to make detailedforecasts of the development of our external position in 1951 and subsequent years. The general character of the problems before us can, however, be clearly indicated.88. These problems arise essentially from the imposition of a major worldrearmament effort upon an already booming world economy. For the UnitedKingdom this means rising import prices, particularly of raw materials. it means growing pressure on limited world supplies of many commodities and the emergence of shortages which affect production in this country and the supplyof goods available for export. It means, further, a substantial increase in purchasing power in the hands of overseas producers of primary commodities,leading to a growing demand for manufactured goods, particularly capital goods for development, which the United Kingdom will find it increasingly difficult to supply. Increased defence production must result in a decline inour exports of many raw materials and semi-manufactured goods, and at least some of the major classes of engineering products. Coal exports will alsobe much lower this year than last. Increasing costs, mainly the result of high prices of imported raw materials, will inevitably raise export prices, and thiswill no doubt offset part of the increased cost of imports, but it is unlikely to do more. Simultaneously, the United Kingdom&apos;s own import requirementsmust be expected to grow to permit an expansion in production and to enabledepleted stocks to be rebuilt and a beginning to be made with strategic stock-piling of essential food and raw materials.89. The combined effect of all these developments on the overall balanceof payments of the United Kingdom is bound to be unfavourable. If they were left to work themselves out without interference, there can be little doubtthat we should again find ourselves confronted with a serious external deficit.This would be a profound setback and would threaten the recently restoredplace of sterling in the world&apos;s markets.90. The Government has resolved that action must be taken to prevent theUnited Kingdom&apos;s external accounts from deteriorating so far that they relapseinto deficit. To the. extent that we are stockpiling essential commodities, thegold and dollar reserves may be reduced, or external debt accumulated, without serious consequences, for this amounts in effect to exchanging asset for asset,or matching asset against increased liability. To this extent therefore, a deficit, though regrettable, could be tolerated. The fundamental objective,however, must be to pay fully in exports of goods and services for the goods and services we need to import for current use or consumption from overseas.Our newly won independence must be kept.91. In face, however, of the large additional burdens imposed on the economy by the defence programme and the continued rise in import prices,the Government has for the time being modified its aim of maintaining asubstantial surplus on the balance of payments. The need for such a surplusarises out of the United Kingdom&apos;s extensive external obligations, and inparticular out of its traditional responsibilites for assisting economic develop-ment overseas, both by gifts and loans and through the drawing down of sterling balances. New forms of such assistance are constantly arising. Forinstance, the United Kingdom has been giving large credits to the european payments Union, thus helping the countries in O.E.E.C. to meet their
substantial trading deficits with the Sterling Area. We have also undertaken to support the Colombo Plan for economic development in South andSouth-East Asia over the next six years. In addition, provision has to bemade for long-term investment in productive enterprises overseas, particularlyin the sterling Commonwealth, to which such investment has of necessitybeen mainly confined since the war.92. All these are obligations which in the end can only be met from a surplus on the balance of payments. Furthermore, we should normally be making provision for repaying our own long-term debts, largely incurred asa result of the last war, and for financing the building up of the gold and dollar reserves, which are still insufficient to meet our essential long-term requirements. The need for a substantial surplus is not in principle affectedby the new defence programme. Indeed, with repayment of the United Statesand Canadian.lines of credit due to begin at the end of this year, the UnitedKingdom&apos;s external obligations may even increase. Nevertheless, while fullyrecognising this need, the Government has reluctantly come to the conclusionthat the maintenance of a surplus during the rearmament period will beimpossible in view of raw material shortages and the concentration of new defence production on the metal-using industries which have been providingso large a part of the United Kingdom&apos;s exports.93. The Government is, however, determined that this country should con-tinue to carry out its traditional economic &quot;functions overseas and to meet itscontractual debt obligations. In so far as the United Kingdom no longerenjoys a current surplus out of which to finance these activities, it will notbe able to avoid some increase in its own overseas debts, or some reductions in external assets. By and large, no improvement in the overseas, capitalposition is to be expected during the period of the rearmament programme.None the less, the aim must be at least to maintain a balance on current account (except to the extent of stockpiling purchases), for a substantialdeficit would raise the serious risk of an accumulation of sterling at a ratefaster than overseas holders might be prepared to tolerate. This would weaken the position of sterling and increase the difficulties we face in buying food and raw materials at a time when world demand has rapidly outrun available supplies.94. The scale and character of the task of maintaining a balance on externalcurrent account are examined briefly in the following paragraphs. The size of our import requirements is considered first, and then there is an examina-tion of how far earnings on invisible account will go towards meeting thebill. From this will emerge the scope of the export effort required, the adjust-ments necessary to accomplish it and their implications for the people of thiscountry.The Import Bill95. The value of total United Kingdom imports in 1950 was nearly 400 million greater than in 1949, virtually the whole of this increase beingaccounted for by rising prices (Tables 12-13). The volume of imports showedno appreciable change, some rise in raw materials and manufactures beingoffset by smaller imports of food. In part, this was a direct result ofthe deliberate decision to economise on dollar imports, taken in concert withother members of the sterling Commonwealth during the dollar crisis of1949. In part, it was due to growing difficulties in obtaining our full requirements from non-dollar sources in face of the increasing pressure of world demand and the failure, through natural causes, of certain agricul-tural supplies. This growing scarcity of non-dollar supplies of raw materialslike wool, softwood and certain non-ferrous metals has been primarily respon-sible for the reduction in domestic stocks which took place in 1950. Forwhile in the early months of the year restrictions were placed on dollar pur-chases of some raw materials on grounds of dollar economy, these wererelaxed later on, and during most of 1950 no such, restrictions applied topurchases of essential raw materials; The decline in stocks was thereforealmost entirely attributable to other faotors.96. In conditions of great scarcity it will not be easy to rebuild thesedepleted stocks of primary commodities. Moreover, we now face a further substantial rise in the cost of all imports. By January 1951 import price as a whole were some 17 per cent, above the average of 1950. even with no further increase, this would add some  400 million to the annualimport bill. But import prices must be expected to go on rising. There is inevitably a time-lag between movements in market prices and their reflectionin the prices of goods arriving in this country, and a further rise in market prices cannot by any means be ruled out, though it may not be so rapidas hitherto.   On account of prices alone, therefore, the United Kingdom
may have to face an increase in import costs of the order of  700 million this year. If to this is added some  150 million required to provide the raw materials for a further increase in manufacturing production, imports in the aggregate (even before allowing for special stockpiling purchases) mayreach as much as  3,200 million in 1951.97. Because of the major uncertainties both as to movements in prices and availability of supplies, this figure can only be a very rough indication of the probable size of the import bill. If we fail to get the supplies, theactual figure may fall short of  3,200 million, but in that event the conse-quences, particularly for our production effort, might be very serious.Invisible Earnings98. One of the outstanding features of the United Kingdom&apos;s balance ofpayments in 1950 was an increase of over  200 million in the surplus oninvisible account (Table 15). Smaller expenditure contributed a little to this result, but the major contribution came from larger earnings. There was an increase of one-third in tourist receipts and a substantial, though relativelymuch smaller, increase in shipping earnings, in which all the major categoriesshared. Of particular importance, however, were, first, the earnings oi our overseas investments (mainly those connected with the production of rawmaterials like rubber, tin and other non-ferrous metals which have experi-experienced the most notable increase in prices); and second, the operations ofthe extensive British oil industry, which enjoyed both higher prices and higher output and sales in 1950. It would be reasonable to exp*ect still highergross earnings from these sources in 1951 and thereafter, but increased costs will help to reduce the net gains. Moreover, the United Kingdom&apos;s obliga-tion under the Loan Agreements with the United States and Canada requirerepayment to begin at the end of this year. On balance, the surplus oninvisible account should be rather over  100 million greater than in 1950,giving a total for 1951 of the order of  450 million.Exports Required99. With a prospective import bill of about  3,200 million, this leavessomething like  2,750 million to be earned by visible exports and re-exportsif the objective of external balance is to be achieved. By comparison, in1950 a highly favourable year for United Kingdom production and exporttrade exports and re-exports totalled rather over  2,200 million.100. A large contribution towards increased export earnings may be looked for from higher prices. The rapidly rising costs of imported raw materials are inevitably forcing up export prices, and already by January 1951 these were nearly 7 per cent, higher than the average for the whole year. Anygeneral movement of internal costs would also have some effect. To theextent that higher prices do not affect the United KTngdom&apos;s competitive position; these increases in export prices will help to offset the higher cost ofimports. None the less, too rapid an increase in export costs might endanger&apos;long-term trading connections. For while world demand for many classes of manufactures is expected to continue at a very high level, there are likely tobe growing difficulties in selling certain types of consumer goods, particularlyin face of the recovery of German and Japanese industrial production. the dangers inherent in this situation will be recognised by United Kingdomexporters, who have made great and successful efforts during the post-war period to keep their prices fully competitive in world markets.101. It is out of the question that the whole of the required increase inexport earnings can be obtained through the rise in prices. The rest canonly come from an increase in the volume of exports, and to achieve suchan increase in the circumstances of 1951 will be a task of exceptional difficulty.A substantial reduction is inevitable in the volume of exports of raw materials and semi-finished metal products, especially coal and steel. Engineeringexports too are tjound to be affected by rearmament in spite of the steps whichthe Government is taking to protect them, and it may not be possible even to maintain them in 1951 at their 1950 volume ; it would certainly be imprudentto assume any increase.102. The broad groups of raw materials, metals and metal productsaccounted &quot;in 1950 for some 55 per cent, of total exports. Most of theremainder, were consumer goods, of which textiles and clothing &quot;are by far the most important classes. It ir, this sector of the export trade that must now bear the brunt of the task of increasing the total volume of exports. Manyof these consumer goods industries are likely to experience difficulty oversupplies of raw materials, and they too have Service demands to meet. More-over, they will face problems of selling as well as of production.
103. The aim must be to increase total export earnings by a very largesum. Within this aim the most urgent tasks are to maintain, and whenever possible to increase, exports to the dollar area above all to Canada andthe United States and to increase exports to the Commonwealth and theColonies. The Government is at present working out export targets for particular industries, and these will be discussed fully with the industries concerned. But it is clear that a strenous effort must be made, and even the limited objective of an overall balance in our overseas payments cannot possibly be attained without large reductions in supplies of many consumer goods to the home market.Regional Aspects104. Assuming that the difficult task of keeping an external balance is infact achieved, what is likely to be the geographical pattern of our tradeand payments, and what are the problems likely to arise in different areas?As the figures in Table 17 show, very substantial changes have been takingplace in the United Kingdom&apos;s balance on current account with the majorareas of the world, and equally significant changes are likely in future.105. The largest change will probably occur in the balance with the dollar area. If our increased needs of essential commodities are met, a fairly sharprise in the United Kingdom&apos;s own deficit with the dollar area seems unavoidable-able. (The implications of this for the dollar accounts of the whole sterling area are discussed below.) The surplus with O.E.E.C. countries may fallas exports tend to be deflected to areas of more urgent demand, but even so the balance of &quot;the Sterling Area as a whole with O.E.E.C. countries islikely to remain in surplus. With other non-sterling countries the UnitedKingdom is likely to continue in substantial deficit, and this deficit may possibly grow* if it does, it will present some difficult problems. The restof the Sterling Area will probably be in surplus with many of the countriesin this group,0 and this will help to keep the whole Sterling Area accountwith them in balance; there are others, however, particularly in the middle and Far East, with which it may not be very easy to achieve a balance. Itmust be our object&quot; to encourage such countries to make the maximum useof their accruals of sterling in trade with other areas which tend to be short of sterling.(0 This group includes Eastern Europe, non-dollar countries in South America, and mostof the countries in the Middle and Far East.106. The position of the United Kingdom vis-a-vis the Rest of the sterling area involves rather different considerations. With the big rise in prices ofsome of the most important Sterling Area raw materials such as rubber, tinand wool, it may be difficult for this country to prevent some decrease inits normal surplus on current account, despite the expected increase in itsown export prices. The major difficulty, already discussed, will be to ensurethat sufficient exports of consumer goods and others in relatively easy supplyare available to make up for any unavoidable decline elsewhere. Even ifthis aim is achieved, however, and the United Kingdom continues heavilyin surplus with dther Sterling Area countries, their own balance of payments with the rest of the world as a whole (including the United Kingdom) is&apos;likely to be in substantial overall surplus too. In other words, we must expect a further considerable rise in the external sterling assets held by thesecountries.Sterling Area Gold and Dollar Accounts107. Since the war and till recently the &quot; dollar gap &quot; has been the centraleconomic problem confronting this country. Devaluation of sterling, restric-tion of dollar imports throughout the Sterling Area, the export drive, andbooming raw material prices have all contributed to the major change which took place in 1950, culminating in the suspension of Marshall Aid at the endof the year. An analysis of the gold and dollar accounts for 1948-50 isshown in Tables 20 and 21.108. Rearmament is likely to have profound effects on this situation. as already mentioned, United Kingdom import requirements from the dollar area have risen greatly; so have the prices of these imports. A formidableincrease in the dollar cost of imports is therefore in prospect for the UnitedKingdom, and to a lesser extent for other members of the Sterling Area.Against this, however, the very large earnings from Rest of Sterling Areasales of essential raw materials can be expected to continue. In particular,the Colonies, whose 1950 dollar surplus was more than two and a. half
times greater than in 1949, will probably earn an even larger surplus thisyear. It will be much more difficult to keep up the level of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s dollar exports, but there can be no doubt of the importance, both to this country and to the Sterling Area as a whole, of maintaining the dollarexport drive at full pressure.109. A substantial deterioration from the favourable situation reached in1950 is in any case virtually inevitable despite higher total earnings, particu-larly if the Sterling Area&apos;s essential import needs (including stockpiling) areto be met in full. The growth in the gold and dollar reserves must thereforebe expected to slow down, and with the elimination of Marshall Aid and theassumption of the new burden of debt service on the dollar lines of creditthe reserves may cease to grow or even decline somewhat. So long as allsteps are taken to keep up the level of dollar exports, and so long as dollar expenditure is confined to essentials, this prospect need give no cause foralarm. The sacrifice of further improvement in the gold and dollar positionis part of the price that has to be paid for greater security. The Sterling area is in a stronger position than for many years to meet this sacrifice, whichcan still be kept within tolerable bounds by vigilance and effort.CHAPTER IVNATIONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITUREProspects of Real Income110. The preceding chapters have described separately the changes likely in the main sectors of the economy in 1951. It is now time to draw theseseparate strands together and to consider the development of the economy as a whole, starting with the &quot; real&quot; changes that may occur between 1950and 1951, that is, changes other than those due only to changes in prices.111. There are many difficulties in attempting to estimate real changesin national output, for one half of national output consists in the supplyof services rather than of goods, and in many cases these can hardly be measured by anything but the monetary value which is set upon them atthe moment. The uncertainty of the forecasts hardly needs emphasising.But however arbitrary each individual figure may be, it is only by combininga number of such estimates that a general conclusion about the prospects for the standard of living can be reached. With these reservations, thefollowing figures are put forward to indicate the changes that appear likely in the main classes of national expenditure between 1950 and 1951. Theyare in terms of 1950 prices.Changes in Output and Expenditure in 1951  millionIncrease in resources:Increase in national output..................... 350* Increase in imports for current consumptionO)............ 125less increase in exports.....................  100Increase in resources available for use at home............ 375Required for:Increase in expenditure by public authorities(0............ 400Increase in domestic investment(0.................. 50450Consequence of consumption:Fall in civilian consumption        .........      .........        75(&apos;) Excludes strategic stockpiling.112. The figure of  350 million for extra output in 1951 assumes that sufficient materials will be available to permit industrial production to riseby 4 per cent, compared with 1950; it also makes allowance for anassociated increase in transport and distribution services. The table furtherallows for a volume of exports  100 million (about per cent.) above theaverage level of 1950 and nearly equal to the volume reached at the endof 1950; this is the sort of increase implied in the earlier discussion in chapter III of the exports required to achieve the objective of an externalbalance.   The increase in the volume of imports shown between the two
years (excluding those for strategic stockpiling) js taken to be about  125million (nearly 5 per cent.). On these assumptions, the burden of the con-tinued deterioration in the terms of trade will be met only to a small extent by a greater call on our resources, but chiefly by a decline in the balanceof payments surplus. Thus, by and large, the real increase in resources that can be expected to be available for use at home will depend upon the growth of production at home.113. The increase in Government expenditure for defence and civil purposes will be larger than this increase in resources.(l) Consequently,,either investment or consumption must suffer a real decline in 1951 by comparison with 1950. As indicated above, fixed investment may fall some-what, owing to the impact of defence expenditure upon the investmentindustries; on the other hand, the increase in stocks of materials and ofwork in progress may be rather larger than in 1951. On balance, therefore,total investment in real terms may show a slight increase. It follows that,even if industrial production increases by 4 per cent., there must be somedecline in personal consumption.(&apos;) In the table in paragraph 111 imports of food and materials for stragetic stockpilingare excluded both from imports and from public authorities&apos; expenditure or domestic invest-ment. Since it is proposed to pay for purchases for stockpiling through a deterioration inthe capital account, such imports will have no other repercussions on the economy. Con-sequently the difficulty in foreseeing how much it will be possible to purchase does not addany further uncertainty to the estimates of the changes in items shown in the table.114. The discussion of the prospects for the textile and engineering industries indicates where part of the reduction in real consumption will takeplace. There will probably be less clothing and household textiles availablefor ordinary consumers, both because of the needs of the Armed forces and because of increased exports; supplies in 1951 will, however, be supported by a good stock position, and higher prices will no doubt restrict,consumer demand. Supplies of durable consumer goods will also be reducedfor the same reasons. Food consumption is not likely to be affected in theaggregate, and supplies of main controlled foods will probably be much the same as in 1950. There will be some increase in the supply of eggs,sugar and sweets, but there will be less meat because of the temporary suspension of supplies from the Argentine. Table 22 records the progressof food consumption in recent years.115. In this analysis of the likely changes in real output and expenditure between 1950 and 1951. the forecast of an increase of 4 per cent, in industrialoutput is of crucial importance. The basis of this forecast has already beendiscussed, and it has been made clear that it is, and must be, a most uncertainfigure. How the conclusions just reached would be affected in detail byreduced productivity would, of course, depend largely upon what type of output fell short. But a reduction of 1 per cent, in the forecast would involvea reduction of nearly  100 million in our total resources, and in conformitywith the general policies described in this survey the aim would be to concentrate this reduction, so far as possible, upon consumption.The Problem of Inflation116. The changes in the physical quantities of supplies underly the financial problems that remain to be discussed. Apart from the physical changessome increase in prices is inevitable, chiefly because of the rise in import prices, but possibly also because of higher costs of production at home ifproductivity falls below the increase in wages. It remains highly important that the increase in prices should be kept to a minimum and that the existingtendencies should not be encouraged by an excessive level of demand.Inflationary conditions of demand occur when the nation as a whole seeks to spend on the supplies available more money than those supplies cost.The problem for financial policy is to ensure that sufficient purchasingpower is drawn off in taxation or set aside in savings to prevent such anexcess arising. Before the forward problem is discussed, however, it willbe useful to analyse in broad terms ths financial situation in 1950 as a whole.117. The evidence seems to show that by the middle of 1950 steadyadherence to the policy of disinflation had brought about a fairly satis-factory balance between total demand and total supply. Demand continuedto run at a high level, but not at so high a level as to cause any markedsymptoms of inflation. The level of unemployment remained extremelylow, but was slightly higher on average over the year than in 1949. Thecontinued rise of consumer prices during the year was due to the rise in import prices, rather than to any inflation of internal costs. There was ageneral tendency for demand to become more competitive, and increased supplies made it possible for many price controls to be suspended by themiddle of the year. There was a general improvement of the retail stock position. Apart from a few special types of goods largely reserved forexport, such as motor cars, whisky and nylon stockings, there were fewmarked shortages in the shops.
118. In relation to the increase in the national income, the increase in personal expenditure in- 1950 was moderate. This made possible the largeimprovement in the balance of payments an improvement, even thoughpartly offset by the fall in commodity stocks. Though the increase in national income was much larger than had been foreseen, the allocation ofthe enlarged national income was in line with the Governments&apos; objectives,and can justly be claimed as a vindication of the general policy of dis-inflation. In achieving this result the most important elements of policy have been the maintenance of a Budget surplus, the voluntary restraint of dividends and wages, and the general restraint of credit by the bankingsystem. The two former have limited consumption expenditure and increased the portion of the national income available for investment. Credit policy,on the other hand, has tended to reinforce direct controls in limiting invest-ment expenditure.119. Monetary policy thus aided the favourable developments of the year.The increase in output and prices made it necessary for industry to raise a considerable amount of new finance; in addition to the sums raised in new issues on the Stock Exchange, bank advances rose by  120 million overthe year. Direct and indirect bank accommodation to the Government was little changed, since the Budget surplus was offset by loans to other public bodies and by the effects of the overseas surplus on the Exchange equalisation-tion Account. The expansion of credit was probably not excessive, andover the year as a whole the rate of interest was higher than in 1949. the yield on Consols averaged 3.54 per cent., compared with 3.30 per cent, in 1949.120. It is against the background of this general stability in 1950, takingthe year as a whole, that the risks of inflationary pressure in 1951 haveto be assessed. These are due to recent changes rather than to any persist-ence of past pressure. The financial policies required in 1951 must take account not only of the great increase in defence expenditure, but of other changes that are likely at the same time. Tables 23 to 26 are designed toset out the national accounts, including price changes. But present con-ditions make it exceptionally difficult to forecast developments over thenext twelve months. The greatest cause of uncertainty is the rise in import prices. These are bound to have an important effect on internal price levels,but it is not possible to say how quickly the economy will adapt itself tothe new conditions. The forecasts given here claim therefore to be no more than a reasonable projection of the effect of current trends in import prices and in internal costs. Though in detail they are bound to be falsifiedby events, they illustrate the main lines of the problems with which weare faced.121. The forecast of national product in Table 23 allows for an 8 percent, increase in the value of the output of industry and commerce. By thebeginning of 1951 weekly wage earnings, as distinct from wage rates, had probably risen by rather less than this proportion above the average 1950level. It is assumed that there will be no significant change in the numbers employed. The increase in import prices will substantially increase thecost of replacing stocks; and the forecast makes allowance for this stockappreciation, as well as for the effects of the continued increase in export prices that seems likely. The figure for the value of the work performed by Government employees rises in 1951 because of increases in the numbers in the Armed Forces, in their pay, and in the pay of certain other Govern-ment employees.122. The prospective increase in prices will present us with a grave problem in maincaining stability at home. Some increase in prices is inevitableO). Wecannot isolate ourselves from what happens in the rest of the world, norprevent the higher cost of imports from affecting our purses. Our wholeeconomy rests on these imports, and the consequences of not getting them would be far more disastrous than the consequences of having to pay more for them. But this does not mean that no action is necessary against inflation.In the Governments view, there are two things that can and should be done.(&apos;) Much of the increase in prices in 1951 will be due to the increase in import prices whichhas already taken place in 1950. Much of the increase in the import prices and in internalcosts in 1951 will pi obably be delayedfand appear first as an increase in the value of work inprogress rather than as an immediate price increase.123. First, while some adjustment to wages may be necessary and someincreases have already taken place, there should be no unreasonable increases in wages or in other personal incomes. In present circumstances, the in-creases which have already taken place, to the extent that they lead to higherexport prices, reduce somewhat the burdens imposed on us by higher import prices. But every increase adds to our costs, leads in itself to further price increases, and to demands for still higher incomes which again lead to higher prices. In the end this process would make it impossible to sell our goodsabroad and thus to get our imports at all, while at home it would lead tograve social injustices which would fall most heavily on those least able tobear them. The policy of restraint in personal incomes is as important to-day as in the past, and is a responsibility of the whole community.
124. Second, we must not allow inflationary conditions of demand todevelop again, for this creates the climate in which price increases are most likely, and adds to the immediate as well as the long-term problem of achiev-ing the level of exports which are necessary to pay for our imports.125. The problem of avoiding the development of inflationary pressuremay be approached from either of two angles. We can ask: will that partof personal incomes which people desire to spend on current consumptionexceed the resources available for current consumption at the prices assumedand at current tax rates? Alternatively we can ask, on the same assumptions:will the funds set aside to finance investment be sufficient to finance the total investment assumed? These are, of course, the same question from oppositesides.126. On the assumptions made here, the national income would increase by about  900 million between 1950 and 1951. Personal incomes would increase much less, for part of the increase in national income would accruein saving by companies, and if dividends continue to be limited, this willhave considerable effect in limiting the increase in consumers&apos; incomes. More-over, without any change in tax rates, part of any increase in personal incomeswould be taken in increased taxes, and this will further limit the sums con-sumers have available for spending. The value of goods and services availablefor consumers to buy may, as shown in Table 24, increase by about  500million between the two years. In spite of the fact that the volume of con-sumption in real terms will have to decline, the rise in import prices will inevitably cause a rise in retail prices, and thus effectively reduce the realpurchasing power of consumers. Because of this, the need to increase taxesto permit the defence programme to be carried through and to enable ahigh level of exports to be maintained is much less than at first sight appears.Nevertheless, a considerable budgetary problem remains.. This is examinedbelow.127. Table 25 shows the revenue account of the Central Government. Thisdiffers in several ways from the Exchequer figures used in the Budget debates,the adjustments being designed to show the effects of the Governmenfs trans-actions upon the rest of the economic system and to consolidate into oneaccount the various transactions of the Central Government. The account isshown for calendar years, since figures for fiscal years are not yet available.The revenue figures are on the basis of existing taxation. The expenditure figures are on the same basis as the published Estimates, except that thefigures for defence allow for the additional expenditure required for the three-year programme of  4,700 million. The figures omit capital items including those connected with defence such as strategic stockpiling and the purchaseof machine tools. Such items are included in investment expenditure inTable 24.128. Between the calendar years 1950 and 1951 the revenue account shows a small increase in revenue of  35 million. On the other side of the accountthere is an increase in current expenditure of  505 million. The currentsurplus would therefore, on the assumptions adopted, decline by  470 million,from a surplus of  420 million in 1950 to a deficit of  50 million in 1951.Between the two fiscal years 1950-51 and 1951-52 the increase in defence expenditure would be somewhat steeper, and the decline in the surplus some-what more precipitate. It is clear from Table 25 that in 1951 public savingswill be greatly reduced by the increase in defence expenditure, unless taxesare raised.129. Table 26 fits the current Government surplus into the national capital account. This shows how the decline in the overseas surplus (which, appears in the table as negative &quot; gifts and loans from abroad &quot;) contributed towardsthe reduction of the sums required to finance investment. We can onlyexport in excess of our imports if we refrain from spending an equivalentamount at home, so that a reduction in the excess allows us to reduce the sums we have to save, private or public, by the same amount. The tablealso shows the contributions that should be made towards the finance of investment in the form of undistributed profits and tax reserves, as profitsincrease with the national income.130. Even after allowing for these contributions, a substantial problemremains. The final item of personal savings is a balancing item and showswhat is needed if we are to avoid inflation, rather than what is likely to happen. But when prices are rising, and there is pressure on the cost ofliving, it seems much more probable that personal savings will fall than thatthey will show an increase of over  100 million.- Further, the calculationis in calendar years and understates the fiscal problem. One quarter of1951 has already passed, and defence expenditure will be expanding rapidlythrough the coming fiscal year. It must be the object of policy to curtailthe demands upon the economy to make way for the increase in defence pro-duction and to help in the very difficult task of finding enough goods to export. &quot;       &quot;   &quot;131. The policy of disinflation has required in the past adequate fiscalmeasures, and has equally rested on restraint by companies in makingdividend payments and restraint by the banks in creating credit these policies must be continued and strengthened.
CONCLUSIONS132. The account given in this survey of the United Kingdom&apos;s economic prospects in 1951 is in many ways harsh and unpleasant. It presents a sharpcontrast to the broadly satisfactory condition of the economy in 1950. Inthe immediate future we face a decline in the rate of increase of national output, a worsening of the balance of payments, a reduction in fixed invest-ment, a fall in supplies of some consumer goods, and a continuing rise inprices.133. For this unhappy prospect our own need for rearmament, and thesimilar needs of our allies in the Western world, are the main and unavoidablecause. Having, after full deliberation, decided that a rapid and thoroughstrengthening of our military defences is imperative if peace is to be pre-served, it is now our duty as a nation to carry out this programme with a clear understanding of its consequences to our civil life. The severity ofthese consequences is the price of peace, and a price that must be paid.134. The Government has set before the nation two objectives. First, sofar as it lies within our power, the defence programme must be pushedthrough, in full and without delay. Second, we must at the same timepreserve our economic strength and independence. The attainment of the objectives will require an extensive re-deployment of the nation&apos;s resources and will make great claims on the energy, skill and adaptability of the british people. In the field of production, it will call for the utmost efforts toobtain as much coal and steel as we can, and to economise in their use;it will impose a heavy new burden on manufacturing industry, both in pro-ducing for the Services and in promoting new and. increased exports to make up for some inevitable falls ; and it gives a new urgency to the programme for growing more food at home. Finally, it places on us all the duty of accepting with patience the shortages and high prices that world rearmamententails, and of doing everything that we can, as producers and consumers,to eliminate waste and inefficiency.135. The United Kingdom is not alone in the tasks it now faces, and intackling them it cannot neglect the responsibilities it bears towards theColonies or its special relationships with the other sovereign independent countries of the Commonwealth. The affairs of the Commonwealth and ofour allies in the North Atlantic Treaty are closely interdependent, and thereis already continuous and close consultation on economic matters betweenthe many Governments involved. It has been the United Kingdom&apos;s policy to develop this collaboration in every way that promises to assist the free world in meeting the risks of dislocation and impoverishment that arise from current political tensions. The value of such international action has been shown again and again in the last five years. The Government believes thatit has an even greater part to play in the future.136. We cannot tell for how long rearmament must continue. The neces-sity for the present programme arises out of the policy of Powers whosemotives and ambitions are obscure. We can only be sure that, the greater the success with which we and our allies pursue the objectives described inthis survey, the greater is the prospect for a peaceful settlement of the workTseconomic problems. Such a settlement the Western Powers are seeking inevery way they can. Meanwhile, it is our task in the economic field to sustainnew burdens, and by the careful disposition of our increasing output to seethat these burdens are as light and as fairly shared as the needs of defencepermit.

In particular, these definitions departfrom previous practice in omitting from the national product an allowance for stockappreciation, (i.e., the increase in cost of replacing stocks at higher prices). It is consideredthat this gives a truer picture of the change in the national product, even though the estimateof stock appreciation cannot claim great accuracy. The great bulk of stock appreciationis deemed to affect stocks held by corporate enterprise; this element is shown separately in Table 26.(2) House rents, domestic servants&apos; wages, and income from abroad.
