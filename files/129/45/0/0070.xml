BAMANGWATO AFFAIRS: TSHEKEDI KHAMA

MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS

For the past six weeks I have been having discussions with Tshekedi Khama along the lines agreed by my colleagues (C.M. (51) 27th Conclusions, Minute 4).

2. The reason why these talks have taken so long is that I wanted to do everything possible to reach an amicable arrangement with Tshekedi. Moreover he continuously produced new points and new documents that needed consideration. Towards the end of the discussions I recalled the Resident Commissioner of the Bechuanaland Protectorate to London in order to save time in consultations with the man on the spot and also in order to ensure that I was making the greatest possible concessions to Tshekedi.

3. In accordance with the conclusion of the Cabinet my point of departure throughout has been to consider the good administration of the Bamangwato Reserve and above all the setting up of a more representative African Native Authority to which we can as soon as possible hand over the powers that we now exercise directly.

4. Unfortunately the Bamangwato tribe is almost to a man against Tshekedi and is very fearful lest he should return and (as they fear) wreak vengeance on his enemies. They have a deep-rooted suspicion that we are trying to foist Tshekedi upon them. I am convinced by the views of my officers and by my own experience on the spot that until these fears are allayed we cannot make progress in the setting up of Councils and a Native Authority.

5. Tshekedi Khama made various proposals to me about splitting the tribal area or federating it with a neighbouring tribe. These would be bitterly resented and resisted by the tribe and I declined to entertain them. Thereafter our discussions have mainly concerned his private rights as a great cattle owner.

6. Tshekedi Khama has very considerable property rights in the Reserve and I would like to find ways by which he can look after his interests as a private individual. Unfortunately it is quite impossible amongst a people like the Bamangwato to distinguish in the case of a man like Tshekedi between his personal and his public capacities. If it were possible, there would be no problem. Tshekedi has, in my view, quite sincerely renounced all his claims to the Chieftainship but if he were to be allowed to return as a private individual all the fears of the tribe would be aroused, also their suspicions of our intentions. The fact that Tshekedi&apos;s own proposals for federation or division of the Reserve were calculated to recover for him a measure of power and authority lend weight to the people&apos;s fears. There might well be disorders: and it is, I think, certain that we could make no progress at all in setting up a more representative Native Authority. On the other hand, once we have satisfied the tribe about Tshekedi&apos;s position I think we may have a new representative African Native Authority working within 6-12 months.

7.- In these circumstances I decided to offer Tshekedi the greatest possible concessions in regard to his private rights that were compatible with the progress and good government of the tribe. Briefly I proposed that if he would for his part give certain undertakings, including acceptance of the White Paper decisions and

a promise not to interfere in the politics and administration of the bamangwato reserve, I would allow him limited access, to his-cattle.posts and provide for the concentration of much of his cattle in an area hear his present place of residence ina neighbouring tribe. (This the tribe hiKgotlo had asked hie not to do.) I told him that in the main he would have to look after his cattle through agents. I told him that we. would be glad to find him employment suited to his considerable; abilitiesin the development of the Protectorate. I told Tshekedi further that if he wouldnot accept these proposals I would then have no choice but to enforce the white paper in its strictest sense and permit him entry to the Reserve only, in exceptional circumstances. I could not allow him concessions unless he gave correspondingundertakings that could reasonably be expected to reconcile the tribe to these con-cessions. ,T- ., ., ,8. Tshekedi has informed me that he cannot accept my proposals. I have therefore had no choice but to announce that the White Paper policy must be strictlyenforced. I annex a copy of the public statement which I is&quot;sued on the evening of24th May. I arranged for this announcement also to be made to a Kgotla in SerOwe.There is little doubt that this decision will please the tribe; it is indeed more or lesswhat they asked me to do-though they wanted me to go still further and exclude allTshekedi&apos;s followers and his cattle aswell.9. Tshekedi Khama has a number of friends in England, some with a certaininfluence There may therefore be some Stir in public opinion here. The chiefargument that is likely to be used by Tshekedi Khama&apos;s friends is that we ought to distinguish between his private and his public capacity, which, unfortunately, for thereasons I have given, we are unable to do.10. Tshekedi Khama has recently beenlraving talks with Seretse and it ispossible, though I think unlikely, that they may arrive at a reconciliation and bothask to be allowed to return to the tribe in their private capacities. Seretse can, even less than Tshekedi, have a private capacity in the tribe. Leading headmen of the tribe have told the Resident Commissioner and informed Seretse that, though they want Seretse back as Chief, they dp not want either Seretse or Tshekedi or both ofthem back in a private capacityP.

Statement by the Secretary of State for CommonwealthRelationsDuring the past six weeks the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relationshas had talks with Tshekedi Khama, ex-Regent of the Bamangwato tribe in the bechuanaland Protectorate, who has been in London on a visit.Tshekedi Khama asked that the order excluding him from the bamangwato reserve should be rescinded and that he should be allowed to return to live in theReserve. Tshekedi contended that the order of exclusion was unjustified, as hewas not a claimant to the chieftainship, and that it prejudiced his personal interestsand property in the Reserve. Tshekedi further complained about interference- with his property and his followers in the Reserve. Tshekedi also advanced various proposals for the future administration of the Reserve, designed to meet the situationin which the chieftainship is in abeyance. These included federation with a neigh-bouring tribe and alternatively division of the Reserve into two areas, thus enablinghis return to the southern portion.Mr. Gordon Walker carefully considered Tshekedi Khama&apos;s representationand suggestions and has discussed them with him at length. He has informedTshekedi that the exclusion order, imposed in accordance with the decisions setout in the White Paper, Cmd. 7913, cannot be rescinded. The reasons given inthe &quot;White Paper still hold good and have been reinforced by all that has happenedsince its publication. As the White Paper explained, the Bamangwato have forlong displayed tendencies to faction and feud between branches of the ruling family
and the dispute arising over Seretse&apos;s marriage aggravated these tendencies. TheSecretary of State was and is fully satisfied that it is only in the absence of bothSeretse and Tshekedi from the scene that there can be any hope of establishing aa stable native Administration along more representative lines than in the past.Moreover, there is ample evidence that many Bamangwato are very strongly, opposed to Tshekedi. All speakers at the Secretary of State&apos;s Kgotla at Serowe.on 1st February emphasised this and urged that he should not be allowed to returnto the Reserve. The Protectorate Administration reports that his return wouldbe deeply resented by many people and that disorder might be the result. although he has disavowed all claims to the chieftainship or regency, his return would be generally construed as a step toward recovery of a position of power and authority.Nevertheless, the Secretary of State made certain proposals whereby Tshekediwould be given opportunity for more personal supervision of his property in theReserve under certain conditions made necessary by the state of feeling there. TheSecretary of State also offered Government assistance in the development of land to which Tshekedi might move numbers of his cattle into closer proximity to his present settlement in the neighbouring Bakwena Reserve, to whose chief he hastransferred his allegiance. Tshekedi did not see his way to accept these proposalsor the conditions attached to them. He must accordingly arrange for the care ofhis property in the Reserve by agents and can be granted permission to visit theReserve only in the most exceptional circumstances.Mr. Gordon Walker undertook that the Protectorate Administration would go into various complaints made by Tshekedi about interference with his property and his followers in the Reserve.The Secretary of State has also carefully considered Tshekedi&apos;s proposals forthe future administration of the Reserve. He welcomes Tshekedi&apos;s recognition that more representative institutions are desirable, but is satisfied that none of Tshekedi&apos;sother proposals is at present acceptable or practicable. Both federation and divisionof the Reserve would result in loss by the Bamangwato of their identity as a com-posite group. In the absence of any demand from the bulk of the people HisMajesty&apos;s Government could not possibly pursue either proposal to meet the special position of an individual and his immediate following.Mr. Gordon Walker indicated to Tshekedi Khama that, if now or later he was prepared to consider employment in some other sphere which would enable himto continue to serve his fellow Africans, the Government will be only too happy tomake use of his services and would be ready at any time to discuss appropriateemployment.Commonwealth Relations Office,Downing Street, SWA,,    24th May, 1951.
