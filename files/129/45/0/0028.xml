DOCUMENT- I3-T-HE PRQPER-TY OF-HIS BRITANNIC -MA-EST Y&apos;S GOVER-NMENT-)-confidential cp. (51) 103 COPY NO. *9TH APRIL, 1951CABINETBAMANGWATO AFFAIRS:   TSHEKEDI KHAMAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations am continuing with Tshekedi in London talks which I began in Mafeking during my visit to the Bechuanaland Protectorate.2. In accordance with the decisions set out in the White Paperabout the succession to the Bamangwato Chieftainship (Cmd. 7913)Tshekedi has been ordered to reside outside the Bamangwato Reserve andis not allowed to enter it except by special permission.   He has been livingclose to the Bamangwato boundary in the Bakwena Reserve and during the pasttwelve months has been given permission for several visits to the reserve to enable him to look after his property,(mainly cattle), and interests there.3. So far I have largely listened to Tshekedi and studied thevoluminous documents which he has prepared in support of his case.   Butat an early date I mast give him my decisions.4. Tshekedi resents very deeply the order excluding him fromresidence in the Bamangwato Reserve.   He has asked that it should berescinded and that he should be allowed to return to live in the Reserve.He contends that the order is unjustified.   He went into voluntary exile in1949 (that is, before the White Paper) in protest against the breaking of a principle of the African social order, i. e. the possible recognition of seretse&apos;s marriage as valid under native law and custom.   Our decisionupheld that principle, yet for standing by it he has in his view beenunfairly penalised.   He himself never contemplated that voluntary exilewould debar him from returning to the Reserve from time to time totake care of his own interests.   He argues that ranching operations on thescale he conducts cannot be carried out without personal supervision;Moreover, in his absence his enemies do all they can to damage hisinterests by interference with his property, grazing rights, water and arablelands and by molesting and intimidating his followers and employees.Tshekedi says that he is at one with His Majesty&apos;s government over the introduction of more representative local government in the Reserve,but he argues that the tribe must have a head otherwise the system willmerely be continued direct rule camouflaged by councils.   He hasadvanced various alternative proposals to meet this situation, viz.federation of the Bamangwato with-another tribe, partition of the Reservevirtually into pro-Seretse and pro-Tshekedi areas or the appointment of the senior man in his following as regent.  All three of these plans are calculated to assure his return to power.   Indeed he argues that to make anyof them a success his active participation is essential.If the-exclusion order against him is rescinded Tshekediwould wish to re-establish himself with his followers in a south-eastern areaof the Reserve where he claims his support is greatest.   He admits that his
return will provoke an outcry from his opponents and Seretse&apos;s following,but contends that it will not result in violence or disorder.Tshekedi has also lodged a large number of complaintsregarding interference with his cattle and property and the molesting ofhis followers.   He alleges that the local Administration and the police havenot tak?n adequate or effective action to protect his interests in his absenceand he goes so far as to suggest that they are prejudiced against him.5. I have considered all these representations very carefully inconsultation with the High Commissioner and his officers.   I recentlyvisited the Protectorate including the Bamangwato Reserve and saw for myselfhow things stand.There is some force in Tshekedi&apos;s arguments, particularly those that concern his own personal position.   He undoubtedly suffers somehardship through his absence, especially regarding the care of his cattle.We must, however, give prime place to the interests of the bamangwato people, whose whole social structure has been shaken by recent events and who are now making a slow and steady recovery.6. I am completely convinced of the wisdom of the White Paperdecisions and that Tshekedi&apos;s exclusion from residence in the Reserve is fully justified.   At the Kgotla which I held at Serowe on 1st February, the attendance was estimated at 10,000and all ten speakers without exceptionemphasised dislike if not hatred of Tshekedi and pressed for his continuedexclusion.   The audience appeared fully to support these views.   local officers report that the support enjoyed by Tshekedi in the Reserve is negligible and that the vast bulk of the people are bitterly opposed to his return.   These officers advise that rescindment of the exclusion order andeven continuation of visits by Tshekedi to-the Reserve may lead to seriousdisorder and will certainly retard the re-establishment of order and localgovernment.   Tshekedi&apos;s reiterated disavowal of claim to the chieftainshipmakes little difference for, particularly in view of his personality andreputation, his return in any capacity to the Reserve would inevitably be construed by most of the inhabitants as a step towards his recovery of power and authority over them.   He is generally feared as a strong andrevengeful man who would punish and discriminate against all the leaderswho have declared themselves against him.   Bamangwato history is full of this sort of thing.   When Tshekedi1 s proposals to federate or partition the tribe become known, they will incense the Bamangwato and convince themthat he sets his personal ambitions above their interests.7. Moreover, the decisions set out in the White Paper were based onreasons wider than any differences existing between Tshekedi and Seretseand their partisans.   As the White Paper explained the Bamangwato have forlong displayed tendencies to faction and feud between branches of the rulingfamily and the dispute arising over Seretse&apos;s marriage merely aggravated thesetendencies.   I am firmly convinced that until the Bamangwato are satisfiedthat Tshekedi will be firmly excluded from the tribal area, they will notsettle down to the establishment of local and central councils which is now underway.   This is necessary both in order to make the tribal organisation more representative and in order to create a Native Authority to whom we can handover authority and thus bring to an end the present temporary direct rule, whichthe people do not like and which has been criticised by Africans elsewhere.8. I am satisfied that as a result of my visit the Bamangwato are nowready to accept Seretse&apos;s exclusion under the terms of the White Paper.  Allthat now alarms them is the fear of Tshekedi&apos;s return.   The local administration is making reasonably good progress in the establishment of-2-
a new Native Authority and understand that its final shape and pattern mustnot be determined until it is as representative as possible and fully understood and accepted by the people.   Consultation with the whole tribenaturally takes time.   Our officers, in whom I have confidence, are convincedthat relatively rapid progress will be made when, but not before, it isclear that Tshekedi will not return.9. I have therefore come to the conclusion that the interests andviews of the Bamangwato must prevail over Tshekedi&apos;s private interests inso far as they are in conflict.   The only hope of orderly progress is forus to stick to our declared policy.   To wobble now would be fatal.This means that the White Taper policy must be firmlyenforced - as I declared at the Kgotla it would be,   I must tell Tshekedithat his exclusion stands and that he can only return to the tribal area in very special circumstances and only with special leave,I will do what I can to protect and preserve his private interests,I propose to instruct the local Administration to examine and dealenergetically with Tshekedi&apos;s complaints regarding interference with his property and the molesting of his followers,I will also assure Tshekedi that the Administration will protecthis property and interests during his absence.I will propose to Tshekedi that he should concentrate part of hiscattle in an area at present very sparsely inhabited in the extreme South ofthe Bamangwato Reserve and near his present residence.  This will costmoney which, in the present state of the Protectorate&apos;s finances, willhave to come from United Kingdom sources.   For the administration will haveto help by making bore-holes, dams, and roads to open up the area and provide access to the railway.   The Bamangwato will not like this and indeed,in their speeches to me, protested against any such proposal.   It is, however,necessary in order to give Tshekedi reasonable justice.   He will still have toleave many of his cattle in the main tribal area and look after them (asSeretse is doing) through agents.10. It is possible that Tshekedi may accept these decisions and suggestions with a fair grace.  But he may well be resentful and angry.   He may-contest the exclusion order in the courts or even (although I doubt it) attempt todefy it physically.   On the Prime Ministers directions I have already taken the advice of the Law Officers who are satisfied that the powers availableamply justify and validate the action taken to exclude him.Tshekedi may seek to enlist public support in Britain.   I am surehe cannot stir up anything like the trouble that Seretse did; but he may winsome sympathy.   He may argue that our real reasons for refusing torecognise Seretse and for excluding him were fear of South Africanreactions and that, besides inflicting injustice on him, we have brought the Bamangwato to chaos and thus brought them closer to incorporation intothe Union.Tshekedi may even try to stage a reconciliation with Seretse and demand that they should both be allowed to return as private individuals.There is, however, at the moment no indication of Seretse&apos;s willingness to be reconciled.   Indeed he has been receiving warnings from his followers inSerowe that they will not recognise any agreement which he may enterinto with Tshekedi and that they are not prepared to countenance the returnto the Reserve of Seretse and Tshekedi as private individuals.   They have
also informed the Resident Commissioner in the same sense and explainedthat they are opposed to the return of Seretse in any capacity except thatof Chief., It is of course quite impossible for men in the position of tshekedi and Seretse to have a private capacity among a people like the bamangwato,   When Seretse returned to the tribe to be with Ruth he wasnot able, even when he tried, to avoid exercising many of the functions of a chief.   The people expected and demanded it of him and resorted to him in general.   In the same way Tshekedi&apos;s visits to look after his cattle(in a purely private capacity) have angered and frightened the people and fedtheir fears that he wants to be chief.   Moreover, it is implicit in allTshekedi1 s own proposals that his leadership is required as well as his presence,I intend to provide as well as may be against these dangers byensuring, if Tshekedi shows resentment, that our account of the backgroundand reasons for our decision is fully understood by the press beforeTshekedi puts out his version,   I expect, too, that there will be favourablereactions from the Bamangwato.  We cannot, however, expect, should Tshekediseek public support, that there will not be some criticisms of us, whichmay be backed by some Labour M.Ps.11. To summarise:(1) I propose at an early date to inform Tshekedi in reply to hisrepresentations that the White Paper decisions stand and that the exclusionorder against him cannot be rescinded,  I will do my best to get him toaccept this and to persuade him to concentrate, with Government assistance,most of his cattle in the south of the Bamangwato Reserve close to his existing settlement.   I will undertake that the local Administration will beenergetic in protection of his interests which remain in the Reserve,  I willalso make clear to him that the Government is anxious to make use of hisundoubted abilities in other directions than Bamangwato political affairs and in a capacity or capacities which will enable him to give furtherservice to his people,(2) I propose immediately I have done so to issue a full pressstatement,to forestall anything Tshekedi himself may say,(3) In the Bamangwato Reserve the local Administration will continueits efforts to restore a system of native administration run by Africans butalong more representative lines than in the past.   With a conservativepeople this is inevitably a slow process, but I am convinced that it is theonly solution and that nothing but Tshekedi&apos;s exclusion under the &quot;white paper policy, can make it a success.P.C.G-W.Commonwealth Relations Office, S, W, 1,,9TH APRIL,. 1951,-
