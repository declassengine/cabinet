-    365THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.3 1CP. (51) 135list May, 1951cabinetWAR criminals memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. At its meeting of 12th February, 1951 (CM. (51) 13th Conclusions, Minute 5),the Cabinet (a) &quot; were inclined to the view that the duty of reviewing the sentences of war criminals should not continue to be delegated to the High Commissioner,or that he should at any rate be expected to seek the Foreign Secretary&apos;sguidance on the more important cases; &quot; and accordingly &quot;invited theMinister of State to submit proposals on the manner in which responsi-bility for reviewing the sentences of German war criminals should beexercised in future; &quot; and(b) &quot;invited the Minister of State to arrange for His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Washington to ask the State Department to ensure that the UnitedKingdom Government had an opportunity of making representationsin regard tp any proposed remission of sentences on German war criminals held in the United States Zone of Germany.&quot;recommendations.   It is recommended (a) That the Royal Prerogative of clemency in respect of war criminals inGermany condemned by British Military Courts should be withdrawnfrom the United Kingdom High Commissioner and, in future, advice to His Majesty in this matter should be tendered by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, who will, in dealing with these cases, followas nearly as the circumstances permit the practice of the Home Secre-taries in connection with persons condemned in the courts of thiscountry.(b) That the draft despatch at Annex A should be approved.(c) That similar arrangements should be made in regard to Austria.id) That notes should be addressed to the United States and French Govern-ments on the lines of the draft attached at Annex B.(e) That a Parliamentary Question be inspired and answered in the terms suggested in paragraph 14 below. -problem.  There are four questions at issue:  A. By whom the power of clemency is to be exercised.B. On what basis the power should be exercisedC. How best co-ordination with the United States and French policies canbe secured.D. What is to be said in Parliament.40602 b
Background  ,A.: By whom the power of clemency is to be exercised4. When the exercise of the power of clemency was originally delegated bythe Secretary of State for War to the Commander-in-Chief in Germany under ArmyOrder 81/1945, no limitation was imposed. Subsequent instruments of delegation were set out in precisely similar terms, but at the time that the power of clemencywas transferred from the Secretary of State for War to the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs Mr. Bevin&apos;s intention was that the power should be exercised ona consultative basis; the nature of the delegation contemplated was indicated inthe following minute by one of the Legal Advisers, which was written at thattime: -&quot; The process of confirming the sentence of a Military Court is a judicialone, and Ministers ought not to give instructions to the confirming authority.But in any subsequent review of sentences, the High Commissioner is notexercising a purely judicial function. It would be proper for him to take intoaccount, and he does take into account, considerations of policy and humanity,and that being so, there would, in my view, be no objection if the Secretaryof State were to issue either general instructions as to the considerations tobe taken into account in reviewing all sentences, or specific instructions ona particular case. The delegation of powers merely authorises the High Com-missioner to exercise certain functions. It is not, and was not intended tobe, an exhaustive delegation of all the Secretary of State&apos;s powers to the HighCommissioner.&quot;5. However, owing to an oversight, no limitation of the power of clemencywas prescribed either to General Robertson or to Sir Ivohe Kirkpatrick. Theywere, therefore, entitled to assume that they had entire discretion in the matter,as had their predecessors, and they acted accordingly.6. I do not think that at this stage we can revert to the consultative system.There must be a clear-cut final authority in the matter..7. After full consideration Mr. Bevin reached the conclusion, and I agreewith him, that there are good reasons why the power of clemency should remain with His Majesty acting1 on the advice of the Foreign Secretary. Decisions onclemency where they concern war criminals almost invariably have political con-notations and may give rise to serious political difficulties, so that it is inappropriatethat the responsibility for assessing the political factors involved and for deciding what value, if any, to attach to manifestations of public opinion should be imposedupon an official. Since the political factors are on the international plane, there seems no alternative but the conclusion which Mr. Bevin reached. I have consulted the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers and they are in agreement.B. On what basis the power should be exercised8. The method recommended is that preparatory work on all clemency cases should be done in the first place in Germany by the High Commissioner and his staff, who Would, in appropriate cases, consult with the Deputy Judge Advocate-General in Germany. The resulting submission, based on all those factors whichthe High Commissioner and his staff are competent to appreciate, will be transmitted to the Secretary of State. The submission will then be considered by the foreign secretary, assisted by his advisers, and a decision reached. If difficult legal questionsarise, the-Law Officers can be consulted, and as regards other aspects of thequestion, the Foreign Secretary will be able, at his discretion, to consult with anyof his colleagues. ..... - -9. It is intended that the High Commissioner should be allowed to continuethe review of cases which began at the end of last year, as it would cause con-siderable embarrassment to announce in public that he had been instructed to discontinue it. He will, however, submit to the Secretary of State for a finaldecision any case where there appears to be a prima facie case for clemency.10. It is not practicable to define principles by which the Foreign Secretary,in tendering advice on clemency, will be guided, except that he will as nearly as circumstances permit follow the same practice as Home Secretaries follow in caseswhere persons have been condemned in the courts in this country. In these cases,as in other cases of the exercise of the Royal Prerogative in matters of. clemency,
Parliament should not insist on its right to criticise, after the event, the advicetendered to His Majesty. In this connection my colleagues will remember that considerable difficulty arose during the Debate on the Criminal Justice Bill in 1948over the Home Secretary&apos;s attempt to define the considerations on which he projceeded in advising on the exercise of the Prerogative of mercy in capital cases inthis country.C. How best co-ordination with United States and French Policies canbe secured f3 It11. I do not recommend that we should address any reproaches to the americans over their action in regard to the Landesberg prisoners, first, on thegeneral principle that it is a bad thing to stir up muddy water, and second, on theground that the Americans might consider themselves entitled to reply that in informing us (as they did) of their intention to institute a review based on certainprinciples, they had fulfilled their obligations under Chapter V of the Charter ofthe Allied High Commission. I propose rather to raise the matter with referenceto the future.12. Chapter V, which is concerned with the purely individual, i.e., non-tripartite responsibilities of the High Commissioners, reads in part: &quot;Each HighCommissioner shall be responsible to his Government with respect to the Lenderof his Zone for the matters in fields reserved to Occupation Authorities listed below.Nevertheless, so far as possible he shall co-ordinate the general policies which hemay pursue in these fields with those of the other High Commissioners and exercisethese powers in accordance with such tripartite legislation or policies as&apos; the council may adopt:  (e) the disposition of war criminals ....(g) control of the care and treatment in German prisons of persons chargedbefore or sentenced by courts or tribunals of the Occupation Authorities,over the carrying out of sentences imposed on them, and over questions on amnesty, pardon, or release in relation to them.&quot;13. I think we are entitled to draw the attention of the Governments of theUnited States and France to the co-ordination called for in this agreement, to the lack, as yet, of any tripartite legislation or agreed policies, and to say that in presentcircumstances we consider such co-ordination more than ever desirable. It istrue that such co-ordination with our United States and French allies may cut bothways and embarrass His Majesty&apos;s Government. Pressure, for instance, might beput upon us to carry clemency further than we otherwise might, but this is a lesserdanger than the embarrassment which can be caused to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand British public opinion, if there is no co-ordination, by a unilateral decision suchas the recent United States one regarding Krupp. There is also the question ofthe extent to which the disposition of war criminals is a matter suitable for attentionunder the new phase of our relations with the Federal Government, involvingplacing the occupation on a basis akin to a treaty. I propose, therefore, that weshould ask the United States Government (and, at the same time, the French) to join with us in instructing our High Commissioners to provide their Governments with areport and recommendations by a fixed date covering all aspects of the war criminalsproblem.   A draft note is attached at Annex B.D. What is to be said in Parliament14. I suggest that for the present all we need tell the House of Commonsis that the delegation of the power of clemency has been withdrawn from the HighCommissioner and will, in future, be exercised on the advice of the Foreign Secre-tary. I would propose to say something on the following lines:  &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that the delegation of thegeneral power of clemency in regard to war criminals condemned by british military Courts in Germany, which has during the past two years been exer-cised by the United Kingdom Military Governor or High Commissioner inGermany, should be withdrawn. In future this power will be exercised onthe advice of the Foreign Secretary. Similar arrangements will be made inregard to Austria.&quot;H. M.Foreign Office, SWA,list May, 1951.40602 b 2
ANNEX AIn February last you informed the Minister of State of your wish to be relieved of responsibility in regard to the exercise of clemency towards German war criminalsheld in the United Kingdom Zone of Germany, a responsibility which was delegated to you in Mr. Bevin&apos;s despatch No. CG 2351/2/184 of 29th June, 1950.&apos;2. After careful consideration His Majesty&apos;s Government have reached theconclusion that because of the political and constitutional factors involved it wouldbe appropriate that this power should in future be exercised- by His Majesty onthe advice Of the Foreign Secretary. You should therefore regard the formerdelegation of authority as cancelled and refer to me for decision all future questionswhere there is a prima facie case for the exercise of clemency. I shall be grateful if,in submitting such cases, you will provide me with a careful analysis of all the relevant factors.3. In view of the fact that the cases were originally tried under military law,I consider that where legal questions arise the advice of the Deputy Judge Advocate-General in Germany might well be of value. You should therefore arrange to consult him in appropriate cases, and embody such advice in your submission.4. The process of carrying out a general review of sentences of war criminalsshould continue but on the basis indicated above.5. As regards the custody and conditions of imprisonment of the war criminalsconcerned, you should continue to exercise general supervision, referring to me for guidance should any important questions of principle arise.6. As regards the major war criminals held at Spandau, you should refer tome any questions of policy or principle, whether they have their origin in petitionsor arise out of tripartite or quadripartite discussions.7. The whole problem of the future disposition of German war criminals,whether in the Western Zones or in Spandau, is one which appears to require ahigher degree of co-ordination between the three Western Occupying Powers, and Ihave decided to raise this^question with the United States and French Governments.A copy of a Note which I am addressing to the two Governments is enclosed here-with for your information.-    ANNEX draft Note to the United States and French GovernmentsIt is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to revise, in the near future,the procedure whereby clemency is granted to German war criminals sentenced byBritish Courts and at present serving terms of imprisonment in the British Zone ofGermany. Hitherto the power of clemency in respect of such criminals has been exercised by the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Germany. It is now,however, the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that such power would be moreproperly exercised by His Majesty on the advice of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, and arrangements are being made to give effect to this decision. A similarchange in procedure will be made in regard to Austria.2. The attention of the United States/French Government is drawn to thefact that, although final decisions on clemency will in future be taken in London,the cases will all be examined in the first instance in Germany and the submissionson them will be prepared by the United Kingdom High Commissioner, so that theco-ordination between the High Commissioners in matters affecting war criminalsprescribed in Chapter V of the Charter of the High Commission will be in no wayimpeded.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government have noted that little progress has hitherto beenmade in the fields of tripartite legislation or policies as envisaged in the charter and it is their considered view that there is greater need for co-ordination now inregard to questions affecting war criminals than ever before. It is obvious thatthe pressure for review of sentences will continue and increase and that the exerciseof clemency may sometimes lead to serious political reactions both in Germany
and in other countries. It is hoped, therefore, that the United States /FrenchGovernment will agree that when, in future, decisions regarding the revision orremission of sentences of notorious war criminals are to be made, the otherOccupying Powers should be given an opportunity to express their views in regardto the announcement and timing of such decisions.4. The need for full and adequate co-ordination also arises from a secondimportant aspect. At a time when the relations of the Occupying Powers with theFederal Government are about to enter a new phase, the problem arises of the future position of war criminals in respect of-(a) custody and (b) clemency. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would, therefore, like to suggest to the United States/French Govern-ment that the time has now come to consider how far these two questions aresubjects which can suitably be put upon a contractual basis, and what reservation of power is required in order to guarantee the continuing rights of the occupying powers to these matters. The study of this problem will raise questions of greatcomplexity, not merely because of the fact that war criminals were condemned andare held in the three Western Zones under three different systems of law and penalpractices, but also because of the fact that the three Western Powers are jointlyresponsible with the Soviet Union for the disposition of the Spandau prisoners.5. In these circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that the problem ofthe disposition of war criminals is one which requires separate study,&quot; and they therefore propose, subject to any observations which the United States/FrenchGovernment may make, that the three High Commissioners should be asked tofurnish a report by a date to be fixed within a period of some four months,making recommendations on all aspects of the question.
