O. (51) 12th Meeting, Minute 4) theDefence Committee considered the problem of the association of greece and Turkey with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.)and decided that the matter should be referred to the Cabinet who shouldalso have before them a memorandum giving the views of the Chiefsof Staff on the military implications of the question.2. I now attach the memorandum prepared by the Chiefs of staff and I endorse their views and conclusion.   An additional reason whichweighs with me in accepting the views of the Chiefs of Staff is that in any event the United States might be disposed to take unilateral action and make defensive agreements with Turkey and Greece outside N.A.T.O,which might give rise to serious difficulties.   As for the criticism thatmight be made that we are extending N.A.T.O. far wider than was originally intended, I regard this as inevitable.MINISTRY OF DEFENCE, S. W. 1. ,17TH MAY, 1951.
TURKEY AND GREECE AND THE NORTH &apos;ATLANTIC treaty memorandum by the Chiefs of StaffWe set out below the military implications of admitting greece and Turkey to full membership of N.A.T.O.Strategic Importance of Turkey and Greece2, The strategic importance of Turkey and Greece in the defenceof the Mediterranean can be summarised as follows:-(a) The denial of their territory to enemy forces,(b) The denial to enemy naval units of passage through the Bosphorusand Dardanelles.(c) The use of the countries&apos; naval and air bases.(d) The protection of sea lines of communication in the eastern mediterranean.3, Both on land and in the air Turkey is an integral part of the middle east strategical area;  a rapid collapse of Turkey in the face of russian aggression would be disastrous to Allied plans for the defence of Egypt,Military Disadvantages and Advantages of admitting Greece and turkey to N.A.T.O.4. Disadvantages(a) Turkey is primarily a Middle East country and can only play a small part in European defence, particularly as there is little likelihood of her effectively defending Thrace.   If Turkey isgiven full membership of N.A.T.O, there is the danger that shewill be drawn into SHAPE &apos;s orbit at the expense of Middle east defence.   This danger does, in fact, already exist and is made no worse by the inclusion of Turkey in N.A.T.O.(b) The United States,and to a lesser extent the United Kingdom, may be pressed to divert forces and resources for the defence of greece and Turkey.   Military assistance to Greece would inevitably be used in European defence.   Moreover, as a corollary to 4(a)above, it is likely that any military assistance which we provided to Turkey might be applied primarily to European defence as opposed to Middle East defence; thus it would be provided at theexpense of our plans for a successful defence of the Middle East.(c) If Turkey and Greece are given full membership of N.A,T.O, it is likely that other Middle East countries may press for similar membership.Such claims could, however, fairly easily be resisted since thesecountries have no connection with European defence,(d) The inclusion of Greece and Turkey in N.A.T.O. would add two extramembers to an already large team and would present additionalsecurity and administrative problems.   It would also add two additional members to those N.A.T.O, Committees on which all nations are represented,
5.Advantages(a) The extension of N.A.T.O, to include Turkey would commit the UnitedStates to assist in the defence of Turkey and so tend to involve herin the defence of the Middle East.(b) Under present circumstances in the event of war Greece and turkey could adopt a position of armed neutrality, but if weincluded them in N.A.T.O. their active co-operation against russia would be more certain.   The armed forces of Turkey inparticular could make a substantial contribution.(c) The extension of N.A.T.O. to cover Turkey would give confidence to the Middle East countries.(d) Military collaboration with Turkey and Greece would be madeeasier.   Turkey would be less reluctant to plan with the middle east since she would no longer fear the loss of American support.Further, the United States Military Mission in Ankara would haveno further cause to dissuade Turkey from collaborating with theMiddle East as is alleged to be the case at present.conclusions, We conclude that the military advantages of including greece and Turkey in N.A.T.O. outweigh the disadvantages.( Signed )     FRASERJ.C.
