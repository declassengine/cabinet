- /38ES DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)5CONFIDENTIALCP.(51) 139 COPY NO.   ^ /24TH MAY, 1951CABINETGERMAN DEBT settlement memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues,the text of a communication and enclosures regarding arrangemenis tor arriving at aGerman debt settlement (Appendix A).    In agreement with the United Statesand French Governments, it is proposed to issue these documents in thenear future to interested Governments and other parties, and subsequently to the Press.2. The documents themselves are largely self-explanatory.    I might, however, recall that the three Foreign Ministers agreed in New Yorkin September, 1950 (CP.(50) 222 of 6th October, 1950, paragraph 6), thatundertakings regarding liability for the pre-war Reich debt and the debtsarising out of economic assistance furnished to Germany by the three powers since the war should be obtained from the German Federal Govern-ment;  and that the Inter-Governmental Study Group on Germany should prepare a plan for handling outstanding claims against Germany in accord-ance with an agreed statement of principle.    The statement of principleprovided inter alia:-(i)     that if a settlement plan were worked out and agreed procedures and controls established to govern it, the three governments would agree to modify the priority of their claims in respect of post-war economic assistance to the extent necessary to permit the fulfilment of such an agreed plan;(ii)     that the plan should provide for the settlement both of pre-war external public and private debts of all types and of claims for post-war economic assistance;(iii)     that claims relating to war damage to United Nations property inGermany and to expenditure on external occupation costs shouldnot be included in the plan.3. The undertaking from the Federal Republic was obtained by an exchange of letters of the 6th March (Enclosure 1 of Appendix A) as mentioned in CP.(51) 74 of 9th March, 1951, paragraph 3.    The work in thepreparation of a settlement plan has now reached a point at which it seems desirable to enter into a series of consultations with interested parties;and I have agreed after consultation with the Chancellor of the exchequer that a special body, to be known as the Tripartite Commission on GermanDebts, should be set up in order to represent the interests of the three governments in these consultations and in the ensuing negotiations.
H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1,24TH MAY, 1951.4. It will be appreciated that the arrangements now being institutedare procedural in character and are aimed at achieving eventual arrange-ments for the settlement of German debts which, in conformity with theNew York decisions, will &quot;assure a fair and equitable treatment of theinterests affected, and remove, as far as possible, obstacles to normaleconomic relations of the Federal Republic with other countries&quot;.5. It is true that discussions with American and French representa-tives on the Inter-Governmental Study Group have brought to light severaldifferences of view over such matters as the scaling down of both pre-warand post-war debts and the conditions under which a settlement of pre-war debts might be effected in Deutschemarks.    It has, however, been agreedthat these differences can best be resolved after preliminary consultationshave taken place with the Germans and some of the creditor interests affected.6. In any event neither the communications which it is proposed to circulate, nor the very general indications which, with the Chancellor&apos;concurrence, I have agreed should be given to the Germans in the early stages about post-war claims, prejudice any of the points in dispute.    Ishall hope to be in a position to give my colleagues further information andto refer to them for decision any question of policy after preliminary con-consultations have been concluded.7. My purpose in circulating this paper now is to let my colleaguesknow as soon as possible of the procedural steps which are being taken atthe present stage to bring about a German debt settlement.    The timing ofthe issue of the documents in Appendix A to other interested governments will depend on the date of their acceptance by the United States and french governments, which is expected to be soon.    After their issue it isproposed to release a communique (Appendix B) and to publish the termsof the basic communication and its enclosures.
Appendix ttA*387THE SETTLEMENT OF GERMANEXTERNAL DEBTS1. The Governments of France, the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates have reached the conclusion in agreement with the German federal government that the settlement of German external debts is in the interestsof the restoration of normal economic and financial relations between germany and other countries. They have also agreed with the german federal Government that interested Governments, including that of theFederal Republic, creditors and debtors, shall participate in working out a settlement plan in accordance with certain principles.2. The exchange of letters which placed this agreement on record,and the letter from the Allied High Commission to the German federal chancellor which preceded it and which set out the views of the three governments in regard to the settlement of claims against Germany, were published on 6th March, .1951 (attached as Enclosure 1).3. As recorded in this exchange of letters of 6th March, the three governments have been engaged in preparing proposals for the working out of arrangements for an orderly overall debt settlement which would be fair and equitable to all the interests affected. They have now completeda tentative procedure for arriving at acceptable settlement arrangements,a statement outlining their present views on points of principle relatingto the settlement, and a list of certain technical questions requiring con-sideration. The relevant documents, which are attached as Enclosures 2, 3and 4, are intended to serve as a preliminary basis for consultations later inthe year. To prepare for these consultations the three Governments intend to hold informal preliminary meetings in order to obtain views of someof the interested parties. Thereafter further communications will be senton the subjects of the enclosures listed above, and arrangements will bemade for participation in these consultations by representatives of creditorsand debtors, of the German Federal Government and of the Governmentsof countries having a significant creditor interest.4. The three Governments, in order to make an overall settlementof German debts possible, are prepared to modify the priority of their claims in respect of the post-war economic assistance which they furnished to Germany, on condition that the settlement plan is acceptable to them.5. The arrangements contemplated relate to Germany&apos;s pre-warpublic and private indebtedness and to the German debt arising out of post-war economic assistance; they do not relate to claims arising out ofthe war, which can only be dealt with in connexion with a peace treaty.6. The three Governments have set up a Tripartite Commission on german Debts to act on their behalf in the necessary consultations and negotiations.   Its terms of reference are attached as Enclosure 5.May, 1951.16832-1   40608bb
Enclosure 1A.-LETTER TO THE GERMAN FEDERAL CHANCELLOR FROM THEALLIED HIGH COMMISSIONAGSEC (50) 2339 23rd October, 1950.Mr. Chancellor,I have the honour to refer to the communique issued by the Foreign ministers in New York in which they indicated that the Federal Government would beexpected to undertake certain commitments consonant with the new responsibilities which the Governments of the three Occupying Powers contemplated would be conferred upon the Federal Republic. The three Governments hold that, at themoment when the Federal Government assumes responsibility for the conduct ofits foreign relations, the status of the obligations resting upon it in its relations withforeign countries should be clarified. The three Governments regard the federal government as the only German Government which can speak for Germany andrepresent the German people in international affairs pending the reunification ofGermany. They consider, therefore, that pending a final peace settlement, andwithout prejudice to its terms, the Federal Government is the only Governmententitled to assume the rights and fulfil the obligations of the former German Reich.The High Commission has communicated to the Federal Government separately -ately the decisions which have been taken by the foreign Ministers concerning theclarification of the status of treaties to which the German Reich was a party. Thequestion of the obligations of the Reich also involves the external debt of the reich. The three Governments consider that the Federal Government should inconsonance with what has been said above, assume responsibility for the pre-war external debt of the Reich. They recognise that, in the determination of themanner in which and the extent to which the Federal Government is to fulfil theobligations arising from this assumption, account must be taken of the generalsituation of the Federal Republic, including, in particular, the effect of the limita-tions on its territorial jurisdiction.The determination of the financial responsibilities of the Federal Governmentnecessarily also involves the obligations resulting from the economic assistance which has been furnished by the Occupying Powers to Germany. As the federal government is aware, the Occupying Powers have, at considerable cost to the peoples of their own countries, extended substantial economic assistance toGermany since the termination of hostilities, with a view to ensuring the well-being of the German people and assisting them in the rehabilitation of their economic life.In due course the Occupying Powers will call for a settlement of the obligationsarising from this assistance. They will consider in the settlement of these obliga-tions the ability of the Federal Government to pay and other relevant factors.Meanwhile, they consider that the Federal Government should acknowledge itsdebt in respect of the expenditures which they incurred and that it should recognise the prior status of these obligations over other claims.It is the intention of the three Governments to proceed as promptly as possible with the development of a settlement plan which will assure fair and equitabletreatment of the interests affected and remove as far as practicable obstacles to normal economic relations between the Federal Republic and other countries.These arrangements would necessarily be provisional and subject to revision when germany is reunited and a final peace settlement becomes possible. The three governments are agreed that the plan should provide for the orderly settlement ofthe claims against Germany, the total effect of which should not dislocate theGerman economy through undesirable effects on the internal financial situation,nor unduly drain existing or potential German foreign exchange resources. Itshould also avoid adding appreciably to the financial burden of any occupying power.The three Governments have instructed the Intergovernmental Study group on Germany in London to prepare a plan for handling claims in accordance withthe above principles and to recommend arrangements for the appropriate partici-pation of other interested Governments and the debtors and creditors, includingthe Federal Government. The Federal Government will in due course be informed of the results of these studies.Although there are numerous problems to which it has not yet been possibleto give consideration, the three Governments are in agreement that the settlementplan should include, in particular, those categories of claims whose settlement would best achieve the objective of normalising the economic and financial relations of the Federal Republic with other countries. In their view the plan must thereforenecessarily deal with the pre-war external debt as well as with the claims in respectof post-war economic assistance which enjoy a priority status over all other claims.
The plan should also provide for the settlement of certain claims in connexionwith social insurance operations and with the conversion into Deutschemark ofReichsmark brought back from Germany by repatriated prisoners-of-war anddeportees, if these claims have not been disposed of before the establishment ofthe plan.In addition to the foregoing matters, other questions may arise in the detailedworking out of the settlement arrangements. For example, it may be necessary togive consideration to certain pre-war debts owed to the residents of foreigncountries which may not be strictly classifiable as external in character.The three Governments recognise that a settlement plan of the scope envisagedcan be put into effect only through some modification of the priority of their claims in respect of post-war economic assistance. Accordingly, the three governments have agreed that, provided a settlement plan is worked out in accordance with theprinciples outlined in the preceding paragraphs and provided further that agreedprocedures and controls are established that will govern this settlement plan andall payments made under it, they will modify the priority of their claims in respectof post-war economic assistance to the extent necessary to permit the fulfilment ofsuch an agreed plan. This qualified modification of the priority of claims in respectof post-war economic assistance will not preclude the continued fulfilment of theobligations which the Federal Government has already incurred under existing agreements concerning such claims.The three Governments feel certain that the Federal Government shares their view as to the desirability of restoring Germany&apos;s credit and of providing for an orderly settlement of German debts which will ensure fair treatment to all con-cerned, taking full account of Germany&apos;s economic problems. They feel equallycertain that the Federal Government will share their belief that such a settlementwill contribute to the restoration of normal relations between Germany and othercountries.The three Governments would appreciate receiving a formal assurance fromthe Federal Government that it regards itself as responsible for the pre-war externaldebt of the German Reich and that it recognises its debt with respect to the expen-ditures incurred by the Occupying Powers for economic assistance to the federal republic and affirms the priority of the claims arising from such assistance overother claims against Germany. They would also appreciate receiving assurances of the co-operation of the Federal Government in working out and implementing asettlement plan as outlined above.In order to give formal effect to these undertakings and assurances and to the undertakings and assurances offered by the Governments of the three occupying powers, I have to propose that, an agreement should be concluded by an exchangeof notes between the Allied High Commission and the Federal Government. It isthe intention of the High Commission to proceed with the modification of the controls in the Occupation Statute on the lines agreed by the three foreign ministers as soon as this exchange of notes is completed and the assurance inrespect of co-operation in an equitable apportionment of materials and products in short supply required for common defence, on which a separate letter is to-daybeing sent to you, has been received. However, it is the understanding of the three governments that the exchange of notes on debt obligations will be submitted tothe Federal legislature for approval and I have to request you to confirm that thiswill be done at the appropriate time.I beg Your Excellency to accept the assurance of my high esteem.(Signed)        Ivone Kirkpatrick,Chairman.B. LETTER TO THE ALLIED HIGH COMMISSION FROM THEGERMAN FEDERAL CHANCELLORBonn,March 6th, 1951Mr. High Commissioner,In reply to your letter of 23rd October, 1950--AGSEC (50) 2339-1 havethe honour to inform you as follows:  IThe Federal Republic hereby confirms that it is liable for the pre-war external debt of the German Reich, including those debts of other corporatebodies subsequently to be declared liabilities of the Reich, as well as for interestand other charges on securities of the Government of Austria to the extent thatsuch interest and charges became due after 12th March. 1938, and before8th May, 1945.40608b b 2
The Federal Government understands that in the determination of the mannerin which and the extent to which the Federal Republic will fulfil this liabilityaccount will be taken of the general situation of the Federal Republic, including,in particular, the effects of the limitations on its territorial jurisdiction and its capacity to pay.IIThe Federal Government acknowledges hereby in principle the debtarising from the economic assistance furnished to Germany since 8th May, 1945,to the extent to which liability for such debt has not previously been acknow-ledged in the Agreement on Economic Co-operation concluded on 15th December,1949, between the Federal Republic and the United States of America, or forwhich the Federal Republic has not already taken over responsibility underArticle 133 of the Basic Law. The Federal Government is ready to accord theobligations arising from the economic assistance priority over all other foreignclaims against Germany or German nationals. The Federal Government regardsit as appropriate to regulate any questions connected with the recognition and settlement of these debts by bilateral agreements with the Governments of thecountries which have rendered economic assistance patterned on the agreement concluded with the United States of America on 15th December, 1949. TheFederal Government takes for granted that these agreements will contain an arbitration clause for cases of dispute. The Federal Government is prepared at once to enter into negotiations for the conclusion of such agreements with theGovernments concerned.bill the Federal Government hereby expresses its desire to resume payments on the German external debt. It understands that there is agreement between itand the Governments of France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain andNorthern Ireland and of the United States of America on the following:  It is in the interest of the re-establishment of normal economic relationsbetween the Federal Republic and other countries to work out as soon as possible a settlement plan which will govern the settlement of public and private claims against Germany and German nationals.Interested Governments, including the Federal Republic, creditors anddebtors, shall participate in working out this plan.The settlement plan shall in particular deal with those claims, the settlementof which would achieve the objective of normalising the economic and financial relations of the Federal Republic with other countries. It will take into account the general economic position of the Federal Republic, notably the increase ofits burdens and the reduction in its economic wealth. The general effect of this plan shall neither dislocate the German economy through undesirable effects onthe internal financial situation nor unduly drain existing or potential german foreign-exchange resources. It shall also not add appreciably to the financial burden of any occupation Power.The Governments concerned may obtain expert opinions on all questions arising out of the negotiations on the settlement plan and on the capacity to pay.The result of the negotiations shall be set forth in agreements. It is agreedthat the plan will be provisional in nature and subject to revision as soon as germany is reunited and a final peace settlement becomes possible.I beg Your Excellency to accept the assurance of my highest esteem.(Signed)     ADENAUER.C-REPLY TO THE GERMAN FEDERAL CHANCELLOR FROM THEALLIED HIGH COMMISSIONERS ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERN-MENTS OF FRANCE, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE UNITEDSTATES.6th March, 1951.Mr. Chancellor,In reply to your letter of 6th March, 1951, on the subject of Germanindebtedness we have the honour, on behalf of the Governments of France, theUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United Statesof America, to acknowledge the undertakings of the Federal Government inregard to the responsibility of the Federal Republic for the pre-war external debtsof the German Reich and for the debt arising out of the economic assistancefurnished to Germany by the three Governments since 8th May, 1945.
With regard to the priority accorded to the obligations arising from the post-war economic assistance, we are authorised to state that; the three governments would not propose to exercise this priority in such a way as to restrict settle-ment of foreign-held claims, arising out of trade subsequent to 8th May,. 1945,essential to the economic recovery of the Federal Republic.With regard to the question of an arbitration clause in agreements coveringth,e debts for post-war economic assistance, the three Governments will be pre-pared, when negotiating such agreements, to consider whether it would be useful to include an arbitration clause to deal with any matters which might be appro-appropriately settled by such a procedure.We further nave the honour on behalf of the three Governments to confirm the understandings of the Federal Government as set forth in the second para-graph of Article I and in Article III of Your Excellency&apos;s letter. They are now engaged in preparing proposals for the working out of settlement arrangements:these will provide for the participation of foreign creditors, German debtors, and interested Governments,, including the Federal Government. The proposals willbe designed to arrive at an orderly overall settlement of pre-war claims againstGermany and German debtors and of the debt arising out of the post-war economic assistance, which would be fair and equitable to all the interests affected, including those of the Federal Government- It is the intention thatthe resulting settlement should be embodied in a multilateral agreement; anybilateral agreements that may be considered to be necessary would be concludedwithin the framework of the settlement plan. As soon as, their proposals are ready the three Governments will communicate them to the Federal Governmentand to other interested Governments and will discuss with them these proposals and the procedure to be adopted for dealing with the subject.We have the honour to state that our three Governments regard YourExcellency&apos;s letter under reference and this letter as placing on record an agree-ment between the Governments of France, the United Kingdom of Great Britainand Northern Ireland, and the United States of America, on the one hand, andthe Government of the Federal Republic on the other, concerning the questionsof German indebtedness covered in these letters. These letters are prepared in english, French and German, each text being equally authentic.Accept, Mr. Chancellor, the renewed assurances of our highest esteem.(Signed)A. Francois-Poncet,     Ivone Kirkpatrick,      John J. McCloy,For the Government of For the Government of For the Government ofthe French Republic.     of the United Kingdom,   the United States ofAmerica.Enclosure 2PROPOSED procedure. In order to arrive at a settlement of German pre-war and post-war external debts in co-operation with the interested parties, the three governments have worked out a tentative procedure for organising consultations and negotia-tions, in which interested Governments, including the German Federal Government,and representatives of debtors and creditors, would take part. In the meetingsenvisaged in this procedure the three Governments would be represented throughthe Tripartite Commission on German Debts.2. The procedure is designed to lead to the conclusion of an intergovern-mental Agreement which would establish the general conditions under whichoutstanding debts would be settled between individual debtors and creditors.3. In the view of the three Governments the Agreement should be arrivedat in such a way that its terms would be acceptable to the various interests affected.This means that representatives not only of Governments but also of privatecreditor and debtor interests should have the opportunity to participate fully in working out the general settlement arrangements which would form &quot;the basis ofthe Agreement. Their participation is in fact an essential step towards and con-stitutes in itself an element in the normalisation of Germany&apos;s international40608b a 3
relations.   On the other hand in view of their interest in the subject, the three governments intend to participate fully in each stage of the procedure.4.   The following procedure is proposed:  (a) Consultations between the&apos; three Governments and the German federal government, the Governments of other countries with a significantcreditor interest, and representatives of creditors and debtors, on the implications of the statement on points of principle in Enclosure 3, on certain technical issues listed in Enclosure 4, and on the procedureitself. The purpose of the consultations is to explain these matters tothe participants and to obtain their views on them and upon the prac-tical methods of implementation. As a result of these consultations,the three Governments would revise and elaborate the documents as necessary.(b) Preparation of proposed settlement arrangements by the interested parties.The detailed organisation of meetings for this purpose and the pro-cedure to be followed will be discussed in the consultations referredto above. It is, however, agreed that the procedure should allow for direct negotiations between representatives of debtors and creditorsand for full participation by the Tripartite Commission acting on behalfof the three Governments.(c) Conclusion of an intergovernmental Agreement which would enter intoforce when signed and approved by the three Governments and theGovernment of the Federal Republic and to which other governments would be able to accede.5. The three Governments have considered the best way of organising the consultations referred to in paragraph 4 (a) and believe that it is desirable that ameeting should be held at which the interested parties, both governmental and private, should have an opportunity of expressing their views. It is proposed thatsuch a meeting should be called in London in the autumn of this year.6. In order to ensure that this meeting is productive and leads without undue delay to the negotiations envisaged in paragraph 4 (b), adequate preparation mustbe made. The three Governments intend that this preparation should includeinformal meetings with German representatives and with representatives of theprincipal creditor groups in the three countries, to which the Governments of fourother countries which have a major creditor interest, namely, Belgium, the Nether-lands, Sweden and Switzerland are being invited to appoint observers. such meetings will be purely preliminary and designed to explore the issues and prepare the ground for the autumn meeting. Governments of creditor countries not repre-sented will receive further documents drawn up after these informal meetings. Itis hoped that through the circulation of the present and later documents all inter-ested Governments will be able to consult the private creditor interests in their own countries and make adequate preparation for their participation at the autumnmeeting.7. Following a short visit to Bonn early in June to explain the procedure tothe German Federal Government, the Tripartite Commission will hold the pre-liminary informal meetings referred to in paragraph 6 in London at the end ofJune. Thereafter it will complete its own preparatory work, and during Augustinvitations will be issued to the full consultations which it is hoped will be heldat the end of September. The negotiation of the general settlement arrangements and the preparation of the intergovernmental Agreement would follow as soonas possible.Enclosure 3POINTS OF PRINCIPLEI1. The three Governments acting in conformity with their responsibilities and by reason of their position as the principal and priority creditors of Germany,have agreed with the Federal Government, in an exchange of letters of6th March, 1951, between the Federal Chancellor and the Allied High Corn-mission that a debt settlement plan should be worked out in the interest of there-establishment of normal economic relations between the Federal Republic andother countries. The general purpose of this plan would be to provide for thesettlement of the pre-war external debts of Germany and of German debtors andof the debts for economic assistance extended to Germany since 8th May, 1945,by the three Occupying Powers.
2. It is the view of the three Governments that, in order to further there-establishment of normal economic relations between the Federal Republic andother countries, the settlement should:  (a) eliminate the state of default of Germany to the utmost extent possible by suitable treatment of matured and maturing debts and of arrears ofinterest;(b) lead to a situation which Would permit a return to normal debtor-creditor relationships by providing methods for settling these debtsby agreement between the parties;(c) be of such a character as to contribute to the recovery of Germany&apos;s inter-national credit by the restoration of confidence in her financialstanding and reliability as a borrower, while giving a reasonableassurance that Germany will not again default on her undertakings;id) be compatible with and as far as possible facilitate Germany&apos;s eventualcompliance with obligations which members of the international monetary Fund and the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation have assumed with regard to the transfer of payments on current account, including interest and earnings on investments.II3. The three Governments, which are also Occupying Powers, have aspecial and continuing interest both in the attainment of the above-mentionedobjectives and in the settlement arrangements adopted to promote them. Theyhave indicated to the Federal Government in their letter of 23rd October, 1950,which continues to represent their views, that provided a settlement plan isworked out which is acceptable to them, they will modify the priority of their claims in respect to post-war economic assistance to the extent necessary to permit the fulfilment of such an agreed plan. To be acceptable the plan must conform to the following principles:  (a) It should take into account the general economic position of the federal republic; it should not dislocate the German economy throughundesirable effects on the internal financial situation, nor undulydrain existing or potential German foreign exchange resources, and itshould not add appreciably to the financial burden of anyOccupying Power.(b) It should provide for an orderly overall settlement of the debts to beincluded in the plan and assure fair and equitable treatment of allthe interests affected, including those of the Federal Government.(c) It should be subject to revision as soon as Germany is reunited and afinal peace settlement becomes possible, and should be capable of adjustment in the light of changed circumstances.In the view of the three Governments agreed procedures and controls must alsobe established to govern this settlement and all payments made under it.4. The settlement of debts can only be put into effect by agreements between particular German debtors and their foreign creditors, but the three governments have agreed that such individual settlements should conform togeneral settlement arrangements which would reflect the foregoing principles.These arrangements would be arrived at in negotiations between representativesof creditors and debtors, the Federal Government, the three Governments, andother interested Governments, and would be incorporated in an intergovernmentalAgreement. This Agreement would provide patterns for the latter agreements between the individual debtors and creditors. If a creditor does not wish toaccept settlement in accordance with one or other of these patterns, then underthe intergovernmental Agreement there would be no present possibility of the debt being discharged.5. It is clear that a settlement plan of the nature outlined above requires that all parties be prepared to make sacrifices in the interest of common agree-ment. It cannot be expected that creditors will make sacrifices unless theGermans make real efforts to meet their obligations and unless the german federal Government on their side pursue such foreign exchange and internalfiscal policies as will enable German obligations to be met under the settlementagreement. The Germans must also bear in mind the heavy burden borneby many other countries. On the other hand, other creditors, like the three governments, will have to give due regard to Germany&apos;s present and future economic position, the other economic burdens which she has to bear, and thefact that she is still receiving governmental economic assistance from abroad.6. The three Governments will give due consideration to the internalfinancial position of Germany and the budgetary position of the Federal Govern-ment, both of which will be affected by certain problems such as the impact of western defence requirements.
7. The settlement plan should provide that as a rule holders of existing debtsdenominated in foreign currencies should continue to hold obligations so denomin-ated which would be serviced in foreign exchange. It is, therefore, the amount which Germany can afford to pay in foreign exchange that is likely to be themost important factor. At present Germany has small foreign exchange reserves and is continuing to receive foreign aid or credit. Although it is desirable that service on the debts should be resumed at an early date, it is evident that in the short run, while Germany continues to receive foreign aid, debt service on morethan a limited scale would add appreciably to the financial burden of the three governments. It seems reasonable to assume, however, that in the long runGermany&apos;s external payments can be balanced without the need for exceptionalassistance. It is necessary, therefore, to make a distinction between what germany can pay in the immediate future and what she can be expected to pay in thelong run.8. It seems clear that Germany will have sufficient resources to resume ser-vice payments on her external debts under a reasonable settlement arrangementprovided that she is determined to do so and to accept the sacrifices which maybe necessary for the sake of removing a serious obstacle to good relationships with others, improving her credit standing and opening the way to normal sources of credit. On the other hand, the volume of German pre-war and post-war foreignindebtedness will be disproportionately large in relation to Germany&apos;s prospectiveability to make payments thereon. Moreover a large part of the pre-war debts hasmatured and considerable amounts of interest are in arrears. In view of these factors a realistic approach by the creditors to the problem will be necessary, andthis will probably involve adjustments of the terms of the debts. The methods and extent of such adjustments are matters which must be determined in the negotiation of the settlement plan.iv9. Other questions for consideration arise from the prospect that somecreditors will seek settlement of their debts in Deutschemark (DM). Considerationmust be given to what extent and under what conditions it would be possible topermit settlement in DM of foreign currency debts. It will be necessaryto assure that the plan provides equitable treatment between creditors who receivepayment in foreign currency and those who desire to receive payment in DM,and among creditors holding different categories of German debts. To the extent that any DM settlements may be permitted, it is considered that the use of theDM received will have to be controlled in order to reduce the potential loss offoreign exchange to the German economy and in order to channel these DM intolong-term investment in Germany.V10. The most practicable method of arriving at an equitable treatment ofthe various creditor groups would seem to be a process of negotiation among themwith a view to reaching agreement respecting the treatment to be provided for thevarious types of claims in the settlement plan. Whatever method is adopted, how-ever, the three Governments will wish to ensure that the settlement arrangementsdo not lead to inequity or preferential treatment as between some groups ofcreditors and others. It will be the aim of the three Governments to see that allgroups are properly represented, have a full opportunity to participate in working out the arrangements, and agree to the treatment of each type of claim in thesettlement arrangements as a whole. They are agreed that the terms of the debtsettlement should not vary according to the currencies in which obligations aredenominated.VI11. Although the settlement arrangements must be sufficiently flexible topermit of revision when Germany is reunited and to allow the creditors to receivehigher annual payments as Germany&apos;s ability to make payments improves, theyshould, nevertheless, provide a stable basis for future financial relations by givingboth creditor and debtor a clear picture of their expectations in the future. this aim would not be achieved if there had to be frequent re-negotiation of the termsof the settlement. Therefore, the settlement plan should go as far as possible inincluding provisions designed to obviate the need of any early re-negotiation. Forthis purpose it will be necessary to provide in the plan for adjustment in the lightof changes in the German economic situation and the manner in which this canbe achieved is a subject which will require careful consideration during thenegotiations. The plan must in any case clearly contemplate the possibility of re-negotiation at such time as Germany becomes reunited.
Enclosure 4TECHNICAL questions in connection with the establishment of a plan for the settlement of Germanexternal debts a number of questions are expected to arise for consideration.Among these are:  (1) Whether German debts owed to foreign creditors which may not be strictly classifiable as external in character should be included in theplan.(2) Questions connected with the operations of the Konversionskasse andVerrechnungskasse.(3) What debts of corporate bodies which functioned as Reich agencies con-stitute liabilities of the Reich.(4) The extent of the liability of the Federal Republic with regard to interestand other charges which became due after 12th March, 1938 and before 8th May, 1945, on securities of the Government of Austria.(5) Specific problems relating to the debts of Prussia.(6) Effect of the gold clause provisions in specific German obligations.Enclosure 5TERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE TRIPARTITE COMMISSION on german DEBTS1. The Governments of France, the United Kingdom and the United states have decided to establish a commission to be known as the Tripartite Commissionon German Debts for the purpose of carrying forward the work of the three Govern-ments in preparing for the orderly overall settlement of German pre-war debts andof the German debt arising out of post-war economic assistance, as envisaged inthe agreement of 6th March, 1951, between the three Governments and the german federal Government.  The Commission will have its headquarters in London.2.   The functions of the Commission will be:  (a) To serve as a means of co-ordinating the policies of the three Govern-ments regarding foreign-held German debts.(b) To take the necessary steps so that a plan for general settlement arrange-ments for these debts is worked out in consultation with the german federal Government and other interested Governments and withrepresentatives of creditors and debtors, and so that the settlementarrangements are embodied in an intergovernmental Agreement.(c) To represent the three Governments (i) in the negotiations relative to these settlement arrangements andthe intergovernmental Agreement; and(ii) in dealing with problems in connection with the settlement of post-war debts for economic assistance.(d) To deal with such other matters relative to German debts as are referredto it by the three Governments.3.
