(51) 9221th March, 1951CABINETBASUTOLAND MEDICINE MURDERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsDuring the past few years there has been in Basutoland a series of particularlyhorrible murders, popularly described as &quot; ritual&quot; murders. This description isinaccurate and misleading as these murders form part of no &quot; rite.&quot; The epithet&quot; ritual,&quot; moreover, tends to give a semi-respectable colour to the murders. i therefore propose to call them in future &quot; medicine murders &quot; and to do what Ican to get this name generally adopted.2. These murders received much publicity and are indeed a matter of grave concern. The outbreak was clearly a symptom of some deep-seated trouble andwith my approval the High Commissioner asked Mr. G. I. Jones, Lecturer inAnthropology at the University of Cambridge, to undertake an enquiry into its nature and causes and to propose remedies.3. Mr. Jones&apos;s report, of which a summary is attached (Appendix A), showsthat these murders were a revival in a new form of a Basuto practice of the last century in accordance with which flesh taken from the bodies of enemies killed in battle was made into &quot; medicine &quot; and used to increase the victorious warriors&apos;own strength and courage. The recent murders were committed to obtain&quot; medicine &quot; for members of the ruling class of chiefs and headmen who believedit would strengthen their position and powers and further their own political ends.The murders occurred sporadically up to 1938, but thereafter the rate of incidencesteadily increased until a peak was reached in 1948 of twenty murders in a singleyear.4. Mr. Jones has associated this rise in incidence with a steadily growinguncertainty and apprehension among the Basuto ruling class over the effect ontheir position of recent political developments in Basutoland. The appointment,after a succession of strong paramount chiefs, of a weak female regent in 1940led to faction and intrigue among the leading chiefs, and created conditions whichmay have pre-disposed ambitious chiefs towards the use of such &quot; medicines.&quot; Itis, however, from the class of lesser chiefs and headmen that most dT those accused of these murders have come. Abuses which crept into the indigenous political system led over a period to a deterioration in the status and economic positionof the lesser chiefs and headmen. The introduction in 1946 by the BasutolandAdministration of reforms, designed to liberalise the system of native self-govern-ment, had the effect of further worsening the position of the lesser chiefs andheadmen. These reforms were, moreover, widely misunderstood and distrustedand therefore increased the feeling of insecurity already felt.5. Vigorous prosecutions which led to the conviction, among others, of two principle chiefs appear to have checked the outbreak, since only one murder, knownto be a &quot; medicine &quot; murder, was committed in 1950. Suppressive measures will,however, not in themselves be sufficient, and the political causes of the outbreakwill have to be removed, particularly that uncertainty and apprehension among theBasuto ruling class to which I have referred.6. Mr. Jones has proposed the following remedies. The leading Chiefs shouldbe persuaded that the reforms were essential and provided a proper outlet for their40338 copy No. O 1
legitimate ambitions. Reform must continue if the indigenous system isto be fitted to shoulder its modern responsibilities. To reassure the lesserchiefs and headmen the communities, of which they are the leaders, shouldbe fitted into the system of local administration as an integral part of it. These com-- munities should be accorded a well-defined and well understood place and given the: opportunity of managing their domestic affairs for themselves and of exercising adue influence on the administration of those of a wider concern. Local enquirieswill be necessary to determine how best this can be done; and these enquiries shouldhave as well the most important aim of bringing the Administration into closercontact with the Basuto people.7. In my view Mr. Jones&apos;s analysis of the causes of the outbreak of thesemurders is eminently sound and I have accepted his main recommendations. some progress has indeed already been made during the past year in the direction of modifying the Native Authority system to secure a closer association of the people with the conduct of their own affairs, but development must inevitably be gradualand the Basuto themselves must be consulted. Local enquiries on lines suggestedby Mr. Jones will be conducted to discover the best method of introducing further changes and, to ensure that the future development of the system of Native Adminis-tration is soundly conceived and executed, we shall draw to the full on the experienceof other Colonial Territories.8. I propose shortly to issue as a White Paper Mr. Jones&apos;s report together withan accompanying memorandum setting forth my conclusions. (The text of thismemorandum is at Appendix B.)9. The press followed the course of Mr. Jones&apos;s enquiries in Basutoland withkeen interest and publication of the report which contains criticisms both direct and implied of the past administration of Basutoland will inevitably revive this.10. I feel that my colleagues would like to have this advance information ofmy intention. If any of them have comments which they wish to make, I shouldbe glad if I could have them within a week after Easter.P. C. G.-W.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,21th March, 1951.APPENDIX ASummary of Mr. Jones&apos;s Report on Medicine Murders in BasutolandBackgroundThe Basuto were originally a concentration of Sotho-speaking tribes of theSouthern Bantil, banded together for self-preservation. They were united as a nation under Moshesh, a petty chief of the Kwena tribe, during the nineteenth century. Following various disputes and local wars, they were finally and at theirown request taken under the protection of the British Crown in 1870.The basic unit of their social structure is the village group, which containsabout 100 male taxpayers and their dependants and is subject to a minor chieftermed a headman. These village groups are again grouped together in wardsections each under a sectional chief; these sections in turn are grouped in wardsunder ward chiefs, and these wards together form the Basuto nation with the paramount Chief as its head.Economically Basutoland is a labour reserve of the Union of South Africa; its people are cattle herders and farmers by inclination, but the land cannot supportthe whole population. A proportion only lives in relative comfort supported bythe contributions of the younger members of the family who have migrated to workin the Union. The result is a society which is both anachronistic and insecure,consisting of an unduly large ruling class supported by a subsidised peasantry whichis unwilling to change its methods of farming or herding and holds that if a manwants to make money he must seek employment outside Basutolahd.
The Nature of the MurdersThe murders which are the subject of the Report have been referred to asritual murders. This is incorrect, as they have no connection with any religious or magical ritual but are committed for the sole purpose of obtaining from the victim particular portions of his flesh. These portions are now called diretlo andare believed to possess special properties which can be transformed into protectivemedicines (lendka), which are used to advance the interests of those for whom theyare made. These murders can therefore best be styled medicine murders.The outbreak of these murders is probably due to revival of a belief in a typeof medicine used in the early and middle nineteenth century, but whereas the human flesh (ditlo) used for this came from the bodies of enemies killed in warfare,the modern diretlo is taken from members of the murderer&apos;s own community whaare belived to possess specific qualities required for a particular medicine.Details of 93 of such murders or suspected murders have been obtained datingfrom 1895. Twenty-three of these happened before and 70 after 1938. Of these 70,30 remain undetected or still under investigation and 2 are awaiting trial.Convictions have been obtained in only 19 of the remaining 38. A summary of atypical murder case is given in the Annexure to this summary.The murders follow a regular pattern. They are always premeditated and theyare committed by a group of people for the specific purpose of obtaining diretlo,which has to be taken from the body of the victim while still alive. If the operationitself does not cause the victim&apos;s death he is killed and his body is then hiddenfor a short period, after which it is exposed in a manner suggesting an accident.The victims have been persons of either sex, of any age and drawn from everyclan or group in Basutoland except from the ruling class of chiefs and headmen.The murderers are predominantly members of this latter class and their followers.CausesThe medicines for which the murders are committed are prepared by nativedoctors known as ngaka, a term which includes diviners and other specialists innative medicines whose functions are not merely to discover witches but to cureall forms of physical and mental disease. It is probably because people are losingfaith in those medicines which are intended to relieve anxiety that some ngaka andtheir clients are turning to stronger varieties, in particular those protective medicinescontaining diretlo.A variety of theories have been put forward to explain the prevalence of thesemurders. For example, certain Christian Missions claim that Basuto initiationschools are responsible for encouraging diretlo murder on the grounds that they make use of human flesh in their initiation ceremonies. The opponents of the roman Catholics have suggested that there must have been some connection between the Roman Catholic doctrine and these beliefs in diretlo as the Christianchiefs involved in diretlo murders have all been Roman Catholics. It has beensuggested that Basuto soldiers were responsible for introducing or reviving thesediretlo murders. There is also a widespread belief that human flesh is used inmaking native beer in Johannesburg. Some have asserted that crimes involvingmutilation are inspired by white examples in the Union of South Africa. There is,however, no real evidence to support any of these theories and it seems clear thatthe probable causes have been, first, friction arising from a disputed successionand the disturbance of the balance of power which has followed the appointmentof a woman Regent and second and most important a deterioration in the positionof the lesser chiefs and headmen.Basutoland was until 1940 ruled by a line of strong Paramount Chiefs andthe succession had never been disputed. On the death of Chief Griffith, however,in departure from Basuto custom a younger son Seeiso was chosen in preference to Bereng, Griffiths eldest and favourite son who, he had intended, should succeed.On Seeiso&apos;s death shortly afterwards his senior widow was chosen as Regent, untilSeeiso&apos;s son comes of age.This was an even greater departure from custom, for the Basuto had notradition of female regents. It led to friction between the Regent and Bereng.The Regent moreover is not strong either in health or character and the absence ofa strong Paramount Chief led to intrigue and friction among the leading chiefs.These unsettled conditions have afforded temptations to powerful chiefs to resort to protective medicines in pursuit of their ends.&apos; - -     40338 - - &quot; Y      - : &amp;\i&amp;W&amp;h&amp;i   &apos;v- As &apos;:W ftsvj       * ?,. v ]
Bereng himself was executed and the murders for which he was convicted andothers which occurred in the regent&apos;s  own ward are regarded by many as havingbeen part of a struggle in which both sides resorted to protective medicine and seta fashion for the lesser chiefs.The lesser chiefs and headmen have been adversely affected by the abuse ofthe Basuto system of.&quot; placing,&quot; under which ward and sectional chiefs can place assubordinate authorities in their territory any number of their sons and paternalrelatives at the expense of lesser chiefs and headmen already there. The systemcaused little hardship when Basutoland was sparsely populated and spare land was available, but as the population increased (from approximately 125,000 in 1875 to560,000 in 1936), it bore heavily on lesser chiefs and headmen who had to give uplands and privileges to support the relatives placed over them.In 1938 the Basutoland Government sought to check the abuse and to control the development of the system by recognising officially the existing subordinateauthorities: but in the identification and selection of these authorities it was com-pelled to depend largely on the ward chiefs. This led to the mistaken omission ofsome and the wrong inclusion of others, thus adding to the insecurity of the lesserchiefs and headmen.Between 1943 and 1946 the Government introduced various reforms designedto make the Basuto political system more democratic and to bring it into line with systems of local African self-government in British colonial territories else-where. The effect of these reforms has been to make the Paramount Chieftainshipless autocratic and personal and to subject the Regent to more control by the greaterchiefs, exercised through the National Council and personal advisers. They havegiven the greater chiefs more authority, but they also had the effect of still furtherworsening the status and economic position of the lesser chiefs and of making them more than ever dependent on the greater chiefs.Moreover, while the greater chiefs were consulted and took an active part in framing the reforms, the majority of the lesser chiefs and headmen and their people were not, and this has led to much misunderstanding and resentful distrust of theGovernment and the Native Administration. It is in these circumstances that manyof the lesser chiefs and headmen, and their followers, in whose ranks most of thoseaccused of medicine murder have been found, seem to have turned more and more to protective medicine to strengthen or retrieve their position.There is a tendency amongst all classes in Basutoland to blame the Governmentfor any misfortune which may befall their country. Their natural resistance to change made them feel that the political reforms introduced by the Governmentwere unnecessary and to attribute to the reforms the murders which followed their introduction.Punitive measures the determined prosecution of chiefs charged with this crime and in particular the principal chiefs, Bereng and Gabashane, has aroused in very different quartersstrong feelings of resentment. Coming so soon after the reforms it supported theview of those most directly affected, particularly the most conservative elements,that the Government had turned against them. Extremists interpreted it as a plotto destroy the chieftainship and betray the country to South Africa while the reaction of many &quot; moderates &quot; and chiefs was to focus this resentment on the police, whowere accused of forcing witnesses to give false evidence against their chiefs.It has not seriously been contended that third degree methods have been used,nor is it likely that any chief or commoner has been convicted on fabricatedevidence. What they complain of is mainly that&quot; unfair &quot; methods have been used,for example, the detention of witnesses for the prosecution for long periods atpolice stations, a practice resorted to by the police because only if isolated fromtheir communities would witnesses say what they had seen.To many of the common people, however, from whom all the victims have come, and who still live in fear of being chosen as victims, the prosecutions have brought relief.Remedies(a) PunitiveThe methods so far employed to deal with these, murders have been propa-ganda both by the Administration and by the Paramount Chief, and police prose-cutions . Prosecutions have had some success, for there was only one confirmed
I    119Annexure to Appendix ASummary of Typical Medicine Murder Case (taken from Mr. Jones&apos;s report)On a Saturday evening in January, 1948, Mochesela KhotO sat in a hut drinkingbeer with Dane Rachakana and a number of other people who had come to awedding feast in Moloi&apos;s village. While the party was proceeding the Chieftainessof his ward arrived with a number of her men; others were summoned from theparty and when they came were told: &quot; I want you to kill Mochesela for me,because I want to make a medicine horn (lenaka) which I will use in the placing ofmy son. Any one of you who disobeys this order will be killed.&quot; One of them wasthen sent to let Dane know that all was ready and when he saw him Dane got up and said to Mdchesela, &quot; Cousin, let us go outside for a while.&quot; Mocheselafollowed him to where sixteen men were waiting for them with the Chieftainessand two of her women attendants. She greeted Dane, reminded him that he hadalready had her orders, and told the men to seize Mochesela. As one of themcaught hold of him, Mochesela cried out: &quot; My father Pholo, are you going to killme,? &quot; and when he did not reply, continued: &quot; Let me free and I will give you myblack ox.&quot; &quot; I am not your father and I want you, not your ox,&quot; replied Pholo.He started to shout, but they gagged him and marched him off away from the village, while Dane threw stones to drive off some boys who had been attracted byhis shouting. When they reached a satisfactory spot they removed their blankets,stripped deceased of his clothes and held him naked on the ground. An oil lampwas produced and by its light they proceeded to cut small circular pieces of skinfrom his body with a knife. Pholo cut a piece from the calf of his left leg, anotherman a piece from his groin, a third from beneath his right breast, a fourth fromthe biceps of his right arm. The pieces as they were cut were laid on a white clothin front of Mosala the native doctor who was going to make the medicine, andone of the men held a billy-can to collect the blood from these and later wounds.Then Dane took the knife and with it removed the entire face of Mochesela.He cut right down to the bone, beginning at the forehead and ending at the throatand he finished by taking out the throat, the tongue and the eyes. Mochesela diedwhile his throat was cut. The Chieftainess, who had stood by watching, is thenreported to have said: &quot; I thank you, my children, for having killed this man for me.I know the police will come here to investigate this matter and no one must tellcase of medicine murder in 1950. Moreover the Regent, previously criticised forhot taking action to stop the murders, has now been taking positive measures.Nevertheless, suppressive measures are not enough in themselves, and action willhave to be taken to remove the political causes.(b) PoliticalThe political situation in Basutoland has left both greater and lesser chiefsuncertain of their position and has led them to resort to protective medicines tocure their uncertainties.For the greater chiefs, the solution should Me in making them appreciate theincreased political power given to them by the reforms and by further increasing their responsibility in the councils of the nation. This will provide an outlet fortheir ambitions.To cure the uncertainties of the lesser chiefs and headmen the administration should set out to identify the local communities, of which they are the leaders,and ascertain their nature so that they can be fitted in as integral parts of thesystem of local self-Government. They should be given a well-defined and well-understood place in it, which will give them the opportunity of managing for themselves those affairs which are primarily their own concern, and of bringing tobear a due influence on the administration of the wider communities of which theyform part. The precise manner in which this should be done calls for further detailed enquiries. These enquiries should be conducted With a further andequally important object, that of bringing the British Administration and the Basutonative hierarchy into closer contact with the Basuto people, so that every local community can appreciate the problems that the Administration are trying to solveand can make its, own contribution to their solution.
them about it. If they do, I will kill them in the same way as I have killed Mochesela;Take the body now to the house of Steve, where it will reinain until Tuesday, whenthose of you who live near will take it to a place where people will see it.&quot; after this she left for her home with her two attendants followed by the doctor andanother man carrying the billy-can and the pieces of flesh. The rest carriedMochesela&apos;s body to Steve&apos;s hut, where it remained wrapped in his blanket and placed in a wool pack until Tuesday night. Then it was carried to some low cliffsnear the village and after some of the clothing had been placed on the grass and ona tree nearby, it was thrown over and then dragged a little further downhill, to befound there the following morning.APPENDIX BConclusions of the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations in July 1949, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Common-wealth Relations, the High Commissioner for Basutoland, the bechuanaland protectorate and Swaziland, appointed Mr. G. I. Jones, Lecturer in Anthropologyat the University of Cambridge, to enquire into and report on:  (1) the nature and significance of the large numbers of murders which had recently occurred in Basutoland;(2) the proximate and underlying causes of the apparently increased incidence of the crime; and(3) the steps which the Basutoland Administration might take to remedy theposition.2. The Secretary of State has now considered, in consultation with the HighCommissioner, the report submitted by Mr. Jones, to whom the thanks of HisMajesty&apos;s Government are due for his able, careful and thorough investigation ofthis difficult problem.3. The Secretary of State accepts the report as eminently fair in its presentation of the historical causes of the outbreak of such murders in Basutolandin 1947 and 1948.4. The Secretary of State accepts generally the recommendations inparagraphs 185-192 of the report for punitive and other action directed towards theearly suppression of the outbreak.Vigorous action, already taken by the local authorities during and since mr. Jones&apos;s investigation, has been in large part successful in suppressing theoutbreak, as Mr. Jones himself acknowledges in the introduction with which hehas prefaced his report. Only one medicine murder is known to have been committed in 1950 and the successful investigation of that was made possible bythe full and ready co-operation of the Native Authority. But as the report shows,the causes of the outbreak were deep-seated and it may be some time before it can safely be said that the murders have ceased. Nevertheless, the situation has so farimproved as to make it unnecessary at present to consider adoption of Mr. Jones&apos;suggestion for the stationing of additional police in certain areas at the cost of the- local populace; this is a measure which the Secretary of State would be very reluctant to adopt.5. The Secretary of State also accepts the recommendations in para-graphs 193-209 of the report, in which Mr. Jones defines closer association ofthe people of Basutoland with the work of government and the institution of less-centralised forms of administration as the longer-term political objectives whichshould be pursued.Although development must inevitably be steady and gradual, further changes have already been effected in the native administration system within the pasttwelve months, as Mr. Jones has also acknowledged in his introduction. these changes are an important step towards closer association of the people with conductof their local affairs. Enquiries of the type suggested by Mr. Jones will be conducted in close consultation with the Basuto to ascertain more precisely the most acceptablemethods for introducing further changes.
6. Further, to ensure that future development of the system of nativeadministration in Basutoland is fully understood and soundly executed, theSecretary of State has directed that tours and visits should be arranged for chiefsand headmen to other colonial territories where they can witness in operation well-established local government institutions.7. The Secretary of State is confident that the steps contemplated will resultin achievement of the objectives recommended by Mr. Jones, in particular greaterdecentralisation, the creation of effective and representative instruments of localAfrican government, and the development of the chieftainship as a continuinginstitution fitted to shoulder its modern responsibilities.Commonwealth Relations Office,March 1951.
