(51) 11827?/? April, 1951CABINETECONOMY IN THE CONSUMPTION OF coal memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power the Cabinet asked me to submit a report on the progress, made in securing,economy in the consumption of coal (CM. (51) 15th Conclusions, Minute 2).The Extent of the problem. In 1950, over 202 million tons of coal were used in the United kingdom for our internal requirements. With conditions of full employment, and with risingproductivity of. labour and a continually increasing industrial, commercial and domestic demand for electricity and gas, we must expect that this internal con-sumption will continue to increase each year by anything from 3 to 7 million tons,variations being due to variations of weather and other factors.3. Writing in February. 1950, Professor R. J. Sarjant of Sheffield Universitysaid: &quot;Figures have been put forward to show that, for all purposes in thiscountry, coal is used at an overall efficiency of 18 per cent. These figures have been challenged, but it is doubtful if the most powerful criticism couldraise the level beyond 25 per cent. If only 10 of the 75 wasted units couldbe put to useful service, the saving would amount to 60 million tons of coalper annum.&quot;4. Two and a half million tons go up our chimneys in the form of soot andsmoke every year. This is not only waste for the most part preventable waste; it also causes a heavy national expenditure per annum on cleaning buildings, &amp;c.Examples of Savings5. There is no doubt that if present knowledge were generally applied, tensof millions of. tons of coal could be saved without great capital expenditure. Thefollowing examples show what might be done:  (a) The oldest coal-driven electricity generating stations still being operated by the British Electricity Authority have an efficiency of 7 to 8 percent. Their newest power stations have an efficiency of over 29 per cent.The average efficiency to-day is about 21 -5 per cent.; in the 12 monthspreceding vesting date it was 20-86 per cent. (A 1 per cent, increasein efficiency means, at present rates of consumption, a saving of morethan 300,000 tons of coal a year.)(b) The manufacture of 1 ton of finished steel required more than 60 cwts.,  of coal in 1920; to-day it requires well below 40 cwts,(c) A modern improved openable domestic stove, burning .19  cwt. of coal,gives as much useful heat as a pre-war stool bottom grate burning34 cwt.40504Copy No.t31
(d) The insulation of 99,000 sq. ft. of a factory roof saved a firm 625 tons of..  coal per annum. The cost was  8,200; it was paid off in less than four- W-W&apos;:]-years,-r&apos;       Vif* I,?        - f      j.:&apos;/ Sr&apos; : ; - /&apos; -- - --/.rMeasures already taken&apos; 6.  The problem of saving coal is two-fold: -(a) Making the users of coal aware that they are wasting it, and leading themto desire to save it.(b) Providing the services and equipment by which improved efficiency of usecan be brought about.My predecessors did much to start both parts of this work.(i) Regional Fuel Efficiency Committees organised conferences of indus-industrialists, local authorities and others.(ii) Special literature was prepared and published, including a monthly broad-sheet entitled, &quot; Fuel Efficiency News.&quot;(iii) A service of Fuel Efficiency Engineers qualified to advise industry was set up.(iv) A service of stoker demonstrators for training stokers was created.  (Oneuntrained stoker serving a &quot;Lancashire Boiler &quot;may waste as muchcoal &quot;perdayas a miner can dig.)(v) Mobile Testing Units were introduced, manned by experts who, withspecialised instruments, could advise industrial firms about how. and where they were wasting heat and power.(vi) A Coal Utilisation Joint Council was created to promote the more efficient use of solid fuel. This is financed by the National  pal Board, the coal.Traders and the manufacturers and distributors of appliances. the expected income is  250,000 per annum.7. These services have undoubtedly given a very considerable result. the mobile Testing Units visited many different kinds of firms in 1950. They showed that oh the average a saving of 22 per cent, of fuelcould be made. In some cases,large savings were effected without any new.capital investment.8. It is, of course, essential that in all these services the officers employedshould be real experts to&apos; whom coaT users must listen because of their&apos;superiorknowledge and experience. This makes j&apos;t difficult to expand &quot;the services as quickly as might be desired.9. Nevertheless, I have, with the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,taken the following steps during this winter:  (a) The numbers of fuel technicians have tyeen increased from 117 to 144. -the approved estabhshment is 166. i hope to acid more, as the right mencan be found. -&quot;&quot; 1 &quot;&quot; &quot;(b) In addition to the four large Mobile Testing Units in use last year, 12 smallerUniJiS-suitable for advising medium size and smallerindustrialfirms nave(c) A senior Executive of high personal prestige and standing is being appqinfedto act as Liason Officer between the Ministry, associations representing-    bqfn &quot;siSes^pf industry, and industrialfirms.&apos; I confidently expect.that&apos;- tjp Officer will be able1 to expand the use of the Mobile Testing UnitsV; &apos;\        and ensure the fuller application of the advice which their staffs give.-Id) The pld Fjael Efficiency Committees have been/dissolved, and new and&quot;&quot;smaller Central aid Regipi^ Advisj6j^ .CQm^Jte^-haye-b&apos;een appointediji &quot;their &quot;place.&quot; :\Tne&apos;.&apos;&apos;C^nttal&apos;&quot; Ajdvis.ofy&quot;&apos; Committee&apos; attached to myMinistry consists of the following: Captain Gregson, Mr. W.L. Boon,Mr.&apos; Qhyer&quot;Lyle, Professor^ Safjant, ari&apos;d;Prpfesspf NeSyittj of the T.U.C.Scientific Advisory Committee? These men are recognised as being: leadmg &quot;authorities oh the subject.  They are starting their Work this&apos; month: &apos;Tney&apos;are empowered to enquire into any aspect of fuelefficiency and to make recommendations.
Long-term Measures;   . &apos;^.V -10.-(a) Co-ordination of Fuel and Power. I am discussing with the Chairmanof the National Coal Board, British Electricity Authority arid Gas&apos; Council how best to co-ordinate the economic and efficient use of gas, electricity and coal in theInterest of the nation. v,.,(b) Promotion of Technological&apos; Development-Work is ih hand on thefollowing matters:-    - ;        f. &quot;&quot;&apos;:(i) industrial drying;(ii) the determination of standard figures for coal consumption under conditions of good practice in the&quot; manufacturing industries;(iii) the development of extended courses of technical education;(iv) the initiation and prosecution of research and development in all theaspects of coalutilisation-steam raising, power generation (includingthei generation of electricity from \yaste steam by back-pfesSUgas production, coke production, district heating, locbinotivb transport and in \he exploitation &apos;6i\btner&apos;sources of &quot;energy. &apos;   - &apos; ;(c) Research in Co-operation with the National Coal Board, British electricity authority and Gas Council.-My -Department carries but an annual review of thewhole field of research in fuel and power matters, including the statutory&quot; researchsubmissionsi of the riatiohapsed fuel industries, and in 195,0 itwasfburid that the fieldwas well covered, with ho&quot; unnecessary duplication of effort-;&apos; :-The.:prospect ofsecuring effective long-term development lies in encouraging an attitude of mind andfacilitating certain methods of working, arid for this reason it&apos;is undesirable to focusprernatiire attention on specific innovations.With this&apos;proviso, it &quot;may be.noted that, in addition to the activities already mentioned under lb)Hiv) above, particular attention is now being paid to: -(i) combined gas and electricity generation, with possible consequent trans-mission of gas by a high-pressure grid;(ii) the underground gasification of coal;(iii) new methods of power generation, such as the coal-burning gas turbinein various forms;(iv) the utilisation of peat;(v) the utilisation of firedamp from mine ventilation: as a fuel for powergeneration;(yi) wind power.Domestic Use of Coal11. (a) There is extensive scope for an increase in the average efficiency withwhich solid fuel is used in the home. The immediate effect on consumption ofinstalling efficient appliances cannot precisely be estimated. Nevertheless, the wide-spread installation of improved appliances at least tends to reduce domestic consumption of solid fuel, and to minimise the consequences of enforced reductionof supplies.lb) Most of the new houses now being erected are fitted with efficient fuel-burning installations. The Ministry of Local Government and Planning and theMinistry of Works are helping to ensure that this becomes standard practice.(c) A very high proportion of the 12 million pre-war houses are still heated byappliances attaining efficiency of less than 20 per cent., compared with the 35 percent, which is a reasonable figure for the performance of ah efficient appliance.Considerable efforts have therefore been made through the Coal Utilisation joint council to encourage the installation of efficient domestic heating appliances byadvice directed to the general public, and to all technical persons concerned withthe installation of appliances and the design of housing. A Training Centre forthe technical and sales staff has been set up: show rooms will follow. It is clearboth from the sales reports of the manufacturers of the appliances, and from thenumber of letters received from the general public, that the importance of the matter is beginning to be understood.(d) Altogether 850,000 improved appliances for domestic use have been soldsince 1947; the number sold in 1950 was 300,000.(e) The Coal Board is engaged on a pilot scheme for replacing the old typegrates in their miners&apos; houses with modern appliances. This may save a good dealof the coal which miners receive on concessionary terms.
saving,; and ibis work,will;go &quot;steadily on.. If, however/ we are.to airn at mojre,rapid progress,! jecommend; the following \ \Av, ^hmlvv..^^   (a) Research should, in accordance with:present policy,. be&apos;ekp^ded^as;&apos;rapl6Uy&apos; as the trained personnel can be found. &apos;; &quot;   -   &apos;    &apos; ^ ;;. .(b) The Technical Services and Mobile Units should be expanded as adehiahdfor their help is created. p:ur\b Ulpj; uimi; ii).? ,, (c) Constant propaganda and education should be carried out to create this demand, and the Government should take the lead in this.(d) Every means should be taken to encourage industrialists to fit efficientfuel-burning plant and to carry out insulation of factories.(e) The adequate insulation of public, commercial, and domestic buildings,including, in particular, schools, hospitals, department stores and offices,should be pressed forward by all practicable means.(/) Nationalised industries like, the National Coal Board and the railway executive should be urged to undertake a definite programme of fittingimproved appliances in the houses which they own, and to aim atinstalling them within a short period of years.(g) Consideration ishould be given by the Ministry of Local Government and planning and the Ministry of Works to means by which the fitting of improved appliances in new privately built houses can be encouraged,and, so far as possible, made obligatory.(h) The Government has given a lead by a definite programme for replacingopen fires with improved appliances in premises controlled by them,e.g., Government offices, Houses of Parliament, &amp;c. This should bestill further speeded up. Local Authorities, the Railway Executive (asregards railway waiting rooms and other station and office fires) other public Authorities, and the Armed Services should be urged to adopta similar programme.(/&apos;) Better hire purchase facilities for improved appliances should be encouraged.(k) Incentives should be found for landlords to fit improved appliances in their houses, if necessary by amendment of the Rent Restriction Acts.(/) The supply of materials to the appliance-making industry should be reviewed in the light of this programme, and steps taken to ensure adequate supplies.P.
