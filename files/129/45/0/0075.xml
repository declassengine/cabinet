THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS   GOVERNMENT  433; Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1951SECRET ----&quot;Copy No.   ^1CP. (51) 15030th May, 1951CABINETINTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, JUNE 1951Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of equal ValueMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National ServiceMy colleagues will, no doubt, recall that the question of equal pay (equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value) was the subjectof a &quot; first discussion &quot; at the International Labour Conference last year. The&quot; second discussion &quot; will take place at the forthcoming session of the Conferencein June, when international regulations will be adopted. In the present paper put forward proposals on the basis of which, if my colleagues agree, I would propose to instruct the Government Delegates for the purpose of the Conferencediscussions.2. The Conference last year agreed that the international regulations should consist of two sections dealing respectively with &quot; General Principles&quot; and&quot; Methods of Application.&quot; It further agreed that the section of the regulationsdealing with &quot; Methods of Application &quot; should take the form of a recommendation,but it postponed its decision as to whether the section on &quot; General Principles &quot;should also be embodied in a Recommendation or whether, alternatively, it shouldtake the form of a Convention. The Conference will therefore, on this occasion,have to take decisions not only upon the content of the proposed regulations, butalso in regard to the form in which they should be cast. The International LabourOffice have prepared alternative texts in the form of (a) a Convention supplemented by a Recommendation, and (b) a Recommendation. For the purpose of the present paper, however, I think it will be sufficient to refer to the texts reproduced in the annex, which set out the proposed regulations in the form of a Convention on&quot; General Principles &quot; and a Recommendation on &quot; Methods of Application.&quot;Equal Remuneration and Social policy. In CM. (50) 35th Conclusions, Minute 1, the Cabinet, in connection withthe first discussions of the Conference, stressed the need to consider the questionof equal pay, not only against the background of financial and economic circum-stances, but also in relation to social policy. This point was stressed by the thenMinister of Labour in the speech which he made in the Plenary Session of theConference, and was also embodied in an amendment moved by the UnitedKingdom Government representative and defeated in the Conference Committee.The thesis that equal pay has to be viewed against the background of social policy as well as of economic and financial conditions is open to more- than one interpre-tation. When propounded at last year&apos;s Conference on behalf of the UnitedKingdom Government, it was seized on by the British Workers&apos; representatives inparticular as constituting an apparent departure from the Governmenfs policy as set out by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1947, and as implying thata high level of social services was held by the Government to be a reason in itselffor not implementing the principle of equal pay.   The Trades Union Congress40655 b
subsequently made a formal approach to the Government on this issue, and, in aletter dated 25th August, 1950, the then Minister of Labour defined the Govern-ment&apos;s attitude as follows: -   .&quot;It was certainly not the intention of the Government Delegation at: Geneva to suggest that the existence of a high level of social services was a reason for not implementing the principle of equal pay. On the other hand,[ they felt it necessary to urge that the obligations embodied in the proposed international regulations should be so drawn as to permit Governments totake into account in the light of given financial and economic circumstances,the feasibility of implementing this principle, while, at the same time, pursuingexisting policies as regards social services.&quot;4. I shall be suggesting (see paragraph 9 below) that the financial andeconomic difficulties attendant on the implementation of the principle of equal paycan best be dealt with by obtaining the necessary flexibility in regard to the timingunder which the obligations contained in the regulations are to be brought intoeffect. I would propose to leave the matter there, and I suggest that the UnitedKingdom Delegation should not, on this occasion, seek to reopen the question ofthe relationship between equal pay and social policy. To do so would, I am convinced, be a.grave mistake. It would not merely involve us in difficulties withthe T.U.C. and the Women&apos;s Organisations, but would also undoubtedly prejudice our chances of obtaining other essential improvements in the text of the regulations.Content of the International RegulationsV 5. Main Objectives-OuT main objectives under this head should, I suggest,be to secure:-(i) a satisfactory definition of the term &quot; equal remuneration for men andwomen workers for work of equal value &quot;;-. (ii) that the regulations are not so framed as to prescribe obligations whichwould be contrary to Government policy and inconsistent with the established system of industrial relations in this country;(iii) that the regulations afford to Governments the necessary discretion inregard to the timing under which the prescribed obligations are broughtinto effect.6. Definition of &quot; Equal Remuneration.&quot; At last year&apos;s Conference we were largely instrumental in securing the rejection of a definition on the basis of &quot; jobcontent.&quot; (See paragraph 5 and Annex III of CP. (50) 117.) While the presenttexts contain provisions for the &quot; objective appraisal&quot; of jobs, this is an optionalmethod of applying equal remuneration, which is defined as referring to &quot; rates of remuneration established without discrimination based on sex.&quot; If there shouldbe a further attempt to embody the concept of &quot;job content&quot; into this definition,I propose that it should be strongly resisted. We should not accept any obligationto promote or ensure equal remuneration defined on the basis of &quot;job content.&quot;7. Obligations to &quot; promote &quot; or &quot; ensure&quot; equal remuneration. Article 2 (1)of the text &quot; A &quot; set out in the Annex is in the following terms:&quot; Each member shall take all practicable measures by means appropriate to the methods in operation for determining rates of remuneration to promote,and, in so far as the nature of such methods allows, to ensure the applicationtp all workers of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value.&quot;This Article, which is embodied in the section of the regulations dealing with&quot;general principles,&quot; is of the first importance, as the succeeding section of the textdealing with &quot; Methods of Application &quot; must be read in conjunction with, andsubject to, it. It will be observed that this Article draws a distinction between&quot;promoting&quot; and &quot;ensuring&quot; equal remuneration. In both cases, the action taken is to be &quot;by means appropriate to methods in operation for determiningrates of remuneration&quot;; equal remuneration is to be &quot;ensured&quot; only &quot;in so faras the nature of such methods allow.&quot; It seems clear that these provisions would,m,i least, involve agreement by the Government to introduce equal pay in the CivilService and to implement this principle in respect of Government employeesgenerally. (The quesiton of preserving our freedom of manoeuvre in this matter is
dealt with in paragraph 9 below.) Moreover, where, as in the National health service, Government representatives are included in the employers&apos; side of the established joint negotiating machinery, these representatives-would, in the courseof wage negotiations, need to cast their influence in favour of equal pay. In general,I suggest that it must be our objective to ensure that the provisions of the Articleare so drafted as not to involve the Government in any action to &quot;promote,&quot; still less to &quot; ensure,&quot; equal remuneration which would not be in conformity with themethods actually employed for determining wages and salaries in the various ser-vices industries and professions.&apos;55 The &quot;drafting of the Article is accordingly being examined with this end in view. If these safeguards are preserved, the &quot;positive action required of us under the regulations would (apart from the importantexceptions to which I have referred above) be limited in character, in view of thenature of our industrial relations system. Some steps would, however, have to betaken over the general field, if only, for instance, through the medium of publicity.It would not be possible to take no action at all.8. I suggest, however, that, if we can ensure that the Article is so drafted as to embody the safeguards suggested in the preceding paragraphs, they could beregarded as a suitable basis for the obligations to be, embodied in the regulations.Timing of the Proposed Regulations9. It is essential that any obligations of the nature described in paragraph above should be such as, if accepted, would leave to Governments the necessarydiscretion in regard to the timing of their implementation. This is of crucial importance as regards the bearing of the regulations on the Civil Service, moreparticularly as any lead given by the Government in this matter would be bound tqhave immediate repercussions on other forms of public employment, upon theindustrial wage structure and upon the professions generally. Moreover, if thisflexibility can be secured, it would, in my view, be unnecessary to insist that theterms of the regulations should be explicitly related to the financial and economic circumstances of the countries concerned (a point which we failed to carry last year,and which we should, in my view, be most unlikely to secure on the present occasion).It will be observed that the preamble to Text B in the Annex embodies the phrase&quot;as rapidly as national conditions allow.&quot; .The proposed Convention (Text A)contains no such provision (in spite of proposals put forward to the InternationalLabour Office by the United Kingdom Government). I propose that, if the Con-ference decides on the adoption of the regulations in the form of a Conventionsupplemented by a Recommendation, the Delegation should do all they can to secure a safeguarding clause on the above lines, inserted in the text of the Convention.10. Jt will be necessary for the United Kingdom Delegation to put forwardamendments to the proposed texts both in order to secure the objectives set outin this paper, and in order to secure improvements on certain points of detail. I donot feel that it is necessary for me to trouble my colleagues with these draftingmatters, and I am arranging for them to be examined by officials.The Form of the International Regulations11. The adoption of a Convention or a Recommendation by the InternationalLabour Conference does not, in itself, bind Governments to apply their provisions,but merely to bring them before Parliament within eighteen months of the close ofthe Conference. At that stage, the decision has to be taken whether to ratify aConvention or to accept a Recommendation. At the same time, the adoption of aConvention or Recommendation by the Conference, with or without the support ofthe United. Kingdm Government, means, in practice, that the Government is fromthen on liable to pressure designed to secure ratification or acceptance.   Assuming,* Under the National Health Service Acts, for instance, the Minister of Health and theSecretary of State for Scotland have the power to lay down remuneration for persons employedby any of the authorities set up under the provisions of these Acts. This power has not so far been exercised, and it is undesirable that the Health Ministers should be,involved in any obligationto exercise it for the purpose of ensuring equal pay. Similarly, it. is not the normal practice torefuse confirmation of Wages Councils Orders except on purely technical grounds, and I under-stand that the Minister of Education would also regard it as important that he should not be put ina position that might render him liable to take any action calculated to hamper the BurnhamCommittees from carrying out as responsible bodies the functions required of them by the education act, 1944.     ....40655 b 2
therefore, that the terms of the proposed regulations could be regarded as satis-factory, it would be necessary to determine whether we should support their adoption in the form of  -(a) A Cohyehtion supplemented by,a Recommendation; or(b) A Recommendation.The question of form cannot, of course, be entirely divorced from content, since there are provisions which might be acceptable in a Recommendation but which we might have difficulty in accepting in the form of a Convention.12. A Convention once in force is legally binding upon the States who ratifyit. It cannot be ratified with reservations. It has to be drawn in precise terms which are capable of enforcement. A Recommendation, on the other hand, if accepted, is not legally binding, and it is possible to accept a Recommendation withreservations both as to substance and as to timing. My proposal is that the UnitedKingdom should continue to press for the adoption of regulations in the form of a recommendation.   I make this proposal for the following reasons:  (a) that we are, in fact, unlikely to obtain a provision in the Convention pro-viding that its provisions shall be applied &quot; as rapidly as nationalconditions allow &quot;;(b) that, even if we were successful in obtaining such a provision, we should be under constant pressure to ratify the Convention, and thus to accept itslegally binding obligations;(c) that the provisions discussed in paragraphs 7-8 above might, if embodied ina Convention, prove embarrassing to us since the necessity for applyinga strict legal interpretation to them might be held in particular cases to involve us in positive action to promote or ensure equal pay of a type which would not be acceptable to us;(d) that a Recommendation, on the other hand, would enable us to accept theobligations proposed subject to any necessary reservations both inregard to timing and as to substance.13. The question of the form of the regulations will arise first in the ConferenceCommittee. It can be raised again in Plenary Session when the Conference are considering the text (or texts) proposed by the Committee. At both these stages, theissue falls to be decided by a simple majority vote. Once the Conference in plenary session has decided on the text which it proposes to adopt, it is referred to a drafting committee, and finally comes back to the Conference for a final record vote in whicha two-thirds&apos; majority is needed before the regulations can be adopted.14. I propose that, in the Conference Committee, the Delegation should press for a decision that the regulations as a whole should be cast in the form of a recommendation. If defeated on that issue there, I propose that they should beprepared to move an amendment to this effect at the &quot; first reading &quot; in plenary session. The attitude which the Delegation should adopt oh the final vote cannot,I think, be determined now. I shall, in any case, wish to consult my colleagues againduring the closing stages of the Conference, and I propose that the line to be takenby the Delegation on the final vote should be determined at that stage in the lightof all the relevant circumstances.Summary of Conclusions15.  I propose that:  (1) the United Kingdom Delegation should not seek to reopen the questionof the relationship between equal remuneration and social policy(paragraphs 3-4);(2) in regard to the content of the regulations, the Delegation should seek tosecure: (a) that it is prescribed that equal remuneration be defined as referring to &quot;rates of remuneration established without discriminationbased on sex &quot; (paragraph 6);(b) that the obligations prescribed in regard to ensuring or promotingequal remuneration should be so framed as to be acceptable inthe light of Government policy and the methods employed for determing rates of remuneration (paragraphs 7-8); and

Appropriate action should be taken, after consultation with the workersor with representatives of the workers&apos; organisations concerned-(a) to ensure the application of the principle of equal remuneration for menand women workers for work of equal value to all employees of centralgovernment departments or agencies; and(b) to. encourage the application of the principle to employees of State, pro-vincial or local government departments or agencies, where these havejurisdiction over rates of remuneration.
\ &apos; 2. Appropriate action should be taken, after consultation with the representa-tives of the employers&apos; and. worl - ei s&apos; organisations concerned, to ensure, as rapidly as practicable, the application of the principle of equal remuneration for men anawomen workers for work of eqiial value in all occupations, Other than those mentioned in Paragraph 1, in which rates of remuneration are subject to statutoryregulation or public control, particularly as regards-(a) the establishment of minimum or other wage rates in industries and services where such rates are determined under public authority;(b) industries and undertakings operated under public ownership or control;. .      ... and .(c) where appropriate, work executed Under the terms of public contracts.3. (1) Where appropriate in the light of the methods in operation for the determination of rates of remuneration, provision should be made by legal enact-ment for the general application of the principle of equal remuneration for menand women workers for work of equal value.(2) National laws and regulations may make provision for specific exceptions to the scope of such legal enactment to be made after consultation with theemployers&apos;and workers&apos;organisations concerned.(3) The competent public authority should take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that employers and workers are fully informed as to such legalrequirements and, where appropriate, advised on their application.  .4. When, after consultation with the organisations of workers and employersconcerned, where such organisations exist, it is not deemed feasible to implementimmediately the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers forwork of equal value, in respect of employments covered by paragraphs 1, 2 or 3,appropriate provision should be made or cause to be made for its gradual applica-tion, by such measures as (a) decreasing the differentials between rates of remuneration for men and rates of remuneration for women for work of equal value;(b) where a system of increments is in force, providing equal increments formen and women workers performing work of equal value.5. (1) Where appropriate for the purpose of facilitating the determination ofrates of remuneration in accordance with the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal valued each Membershould, in agreement with the representatives of the employers&apos; and workers&apos;organisations concerned, establish or encourage the establishment of methods for objective appraisal of the work to be performed, of the abilities requiredfor its performance, and the conditions under which it is performed, whether by jobanalysis or by other procedures, with a view to providing a classification of jobswithout regard to the sex of the worker; such methods should be applied in accord-ance with the provisions of Article 2 of the Convention.(2) Differential rates between workers which correspond regardless of sex to differences, as so determined, in the work to be performed, in the abilities requiredfor its performance and in the conditions under which it is performed, should beconsidered as being in accordance with the principle of equal remuneration for menand women workers for work of equal value.6. In order to facilitate the application of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value, appropriate action should betaken, where necessary, to raise the productive efficiency Of women workers by such measures as (a) ensuring that workers of both sexes have equal or equivalent facilities for vocational guidance or employment counselling, vocational training andplacement; -     ...f,:- -(b) taking appropriate measures to encourage women to; Use facilities for vocational guidance, employment counselling, vocational training andplacement; . .&apos;,        &quot; &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;(c) providing welfare and social Services which meet, the needs of women workers, particularly those With family responsibiiities, and financingsuch services from general public funds .6r.s(^iIseciirijtyt^ds&apos;or lhdus-triarwelfare funds Which are financed by payments made1 in respect ofworkers without regard to sex; arid  .&apos; &quot;&apos;&apos;.......
