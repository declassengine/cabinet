/   394IHIS-DOCUMENT IS THE-PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(51; 140   1&quot; J COPY NO.3/28TH MAY, 1951.   ...CABINETEGYPT - DEFENCE negotiations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recall that, following consideration of my memorandum of 30th March, 1951, on Anglo &quot;Egyptian relations(CP.(51) 95),  it was agreed to instruct H.M. Ambassador in Cairo to reopen negotiations for a new defence agreement based on a revision of the1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, on the basis of proposals worked out by theChiefs of Staff (C.M.(51) 24th Conclusions, Minute 3).    On 11th AprilSir Ralph Stevenson put His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs new proposals to theEgyptian Government (Annex I).    The Egyptian Foreign Minister showedno inclination to discuss the merits of these proposals, intimating at once that they were not an acceptable basis for negotiation from the Egyptianpoint of view.    On 24th April the Egyptian Foreign Minister handed the ambassador his Governmenfs reply in the form of counter-proposals.The text of the Egyptian reply is given in Annex II.2. These so-called counter-proposals consist of little more than areiteration of the well-worn Egyptian demands for British evacuation ofEgypt and the Sudan, and offer no constructive basis for negotiation.    the wide divergency between our own and the Egyptian approach to the defenceissue offers little prospect of agreement and the problem therefore arisesof how we can best contrive to keep the negotiations open without making any concessions of substance.3. I suggest that this might be achieved by broaching now with theEgyptian Government the question of the future of the Sudan.    I have already circulated a paper on this question (C.P.(51) 131), setting out certain basic principles which we should be prepared to put to the Egyptian Government.As a next step we might therefore instruct H.M. Ambassador in Cairo to invite the Egyptian Government to discuss the Sudan on the basis of these principles, at the same time informing them of our disappointment at the wide gap which separates our respective points of view over the question ofdefence and adding that we are meanwhile making a careful study of theEgyptian counter-proposals.4. It does not seem likely that the Egyptian Government will find our proposals in regard to the Sudan any more acceptable than those in regardto defence and we cannot therefore expect to keep the discussion alive forlong on this issue.    As my colleagues will recall, however, the Cabinet     Nagreed that our primary object should be to avoid a rupture with Egypt.When, therefore, the subject of the Sudan has been exhausted, we shall haveto consider whether the next step might be to suggest to the Egyptian Govern-ment that some different basis of approach to the defence problem must befound.    The possible, lines of such an approach are at present under study,
and I would propose in due course to submit the results of that study tothe Cabinet.   We should then be able to decide our policy in the light ofany further developments in Egypt and the Middle East generally.    Iwould, however, add the caution that our experience of the last two yearssuggests that the Egyptians are not so much interested in the form oftheir relationship with us or in finding suitable political cover for joint anglo-Egyptian defence arrangements as they are in their immediateobjective of getting rid of British troops from Egyptian soil irrespective of their own or Middle Eastern security.5. On 21st May we received an Aide Memoire setting out the UnitedStates Government views on the defence negotiations.    These are to theeffect that, whilst the Americans are disappointed by the Egyptianresponse, they hope that we and the Egyptians will be able to reach amutually satisfactory agreement taldng into account not only Egyptiannational aspirations but the vital questions of security.    The americans are apprehensive lest a further decline in Anglo-Egyptian relations mayprejudice their own new approach to the Middle Eastern problem.    Theyconsider it essential that our reply to Egypt should leave the door open fora continuance of negotiations.    They suggest that consideration might begiven to positive steps to create a more favourable atmosphere such asthe resumption of shipments of token quantities of arms to Egypt, and theyconclude by offering to consult with us at an early date informally on ways and means to achieve a solution of the problem.    In general the tone of theAmerican communication is such as to leave no doubt that while they con-tinue to support our position they are anxious that we should come to anagreement with Egypt and thus avoid any development of the tension already existing in the Near and Middle East.6. Meanwhile I would only ask my colleagues to agree that H.M.Ambassador in Cairo should be authorised to invite the Egyptian Govern-ment to discuss the future of the Sudan on the basis of the principles setforth in my memorandum CP.(51) 131 of 10th May.H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1,28TH MAY, 1951.
ANNEX IPROPOSALS PUT BY H.M. AMBASSADOR - IN CAIRO to egyptian GOVERNMENT ON 11TH APRILHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom areprepared to resume negotiations for the revision of the1936 Treaty of Alliance in accordance with the provisionsof Article 16 of that Treaty.His Majesty*s Government in the United Kingdom are aware of the Egyptian Government&apos;s great difficulties in thematter.    They cannot however in view of their commitments totheir other allies in the North Atlantic and in the middle east, accept the responsibility of making any arrangements which prejudice their ability to contribute to a successfuldefence of this region against an aggressor.   Such a defence will only &quot;be possible if in the future the Egypt basecontinues to function in such a manner as to be immediately available in war and if the air defence of Egypt is assured.In these circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom propose that the 1936 Treaty of Alliance be revised so as to provide for the following:-(a) The phased withdrawal of British troops from egypt beginning within one year of theconclusion of an agreement on Revision ofthe Treaty and ending in 1956.    (it shouldbe noted that rate of withdrawal of thecombatant troops and of General Headquartersdepends largely on the rate at whichaccommodation can be provided for themelsewhere.)(b) The progressive civilianisation of the basewhich it is suggested should be completed by 1956, essential British civilianpersonnel being introduced as military personnel are withdrawn.    The basethereafter to be entrusted to the EgyptianArmed Forces for security purposes butto be operated in accordance with british military policy under the overalladministrative control of an Anglo-EgyptianControl Board.    (His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom would be prepared topay rent for base installations and sites.)(c) The creation of a long term Anglo-Egyptianco-ordinated air defence system in whichthere should be both Egyptian and Britishcomponents.(d) The provision at an early date of arms andequipment on training scale for theEgyptian forces and thereafter theprovision of whatever further arms andequipment may be necessary in equalpriority with other nations with whomGreat Britain has working defence agreements.(His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom would also be prepared to renderany assistance required by the egyptian government in the training of Egyptianforces.)
11th April, 1951-a-(e)   In the event of war, imminent menace of war orapprehended international emergency, egypt would agree to the return of British forces for the period of emergency and would grant to them and to the forces of Britain&apos;sallies all necessary facilities and assistanceincluding the use of Egyptian ports,aerodromes and means of communication.
ANNEX IITEXT OF EGYPTIAN REPLY TO UNITED KINGDOMPROPOSALS OP 11TH april the Egyptian Government wishes to express its deepregret and hitter disappointment at the contents of theBritish Government^ reply after long discussions lastingover 10 months during which the Egyptian side has sparedno effort to explain and support its rights and to meet all the considerations with which the British side was concerned in a manner which would not be inconsistent with egypt&apos;s rights,-The Egyptian Government has no alternative butcategorically to reject the British proposals in toto andin detail especially as regards the following points:(l)    The date at which evacuation of British troopsis to begin and the time set down forcompleting that evacuation,(2)    The rate of withdrawal of the combatant troops and General Headquarters being made dependenton the rate at which accommodation can beprovided for them elsewhere.(3)   The time taken in handing over the base tothe Egyptian Armed Forces and the stipulationthat the base he operated in accordance with british military policy under the overalladministrative control of an Anglo-EgyptianControl Board,(k)    The creation of a long term Anglo-Egyptianco-ordinated air defence system in whichthere should be both Egyptian and Britishcomponents,(5) The exceedingly slow rate suggested for theprovision of necessary arms and equipment for the Egyptian -Forces,(6) The return of British Forces to Egypt inthe event of imminent menace of war orapprehended international emergency,(7) Separating the question of evacuation fromthat of the Unity of Egypt and the Sudanunder the Egyptian Crown,(8)    Offering &quot;the earliest practicable opportunity&quot;as a pretext for putting off the time atwhich the Sudanese may enjoy self-government,-The Egyptian Government desires also to affirm that,so far as it is concerned, it rejects the BritishGovernmenfs claim to share in the defence of the middle east on the plea of their obligations towards their other allies in the North Atlantic and the Middle East,
The Egyptian Government puts forward in its turn thefollowing counter proposals as a basis  for resumingnegotiations between the two Governments with a view to asettlement of the problems outstanding between them:(1)    The evacuation of British troops from egypt to begin immediately upon concluding theagreement and the necessity of completingthis evacuation by land, sea and air withina period not exceeding one year.(2)   The base to be handed over to the EgyptianArmed Forces immediately upon the completionof evacuation in accordance with the preceding paragraph.(3)    Special priority for the provision of necessaryarms and equipment to be given to the egyptian army at the earliest opportunity consideringthat Egypt is situated in a sensitive strategicarea.(h)   The unity of Egypt and the Sudan under theEgyptian Crown and self-government for the sudanese within two years in the framework of this unity,(5)   British Forces and British officials to be withdrawn from the Sudan and the present regime in the Sudan to be terminatedimmediately upon the expiry of those twoyears.(6)    The conclusion of an agreement between the two parties whereby British forces may return tothose places to which, in the agreed opinionof two Governments, it is necessary that theyshould return for the purpose, of assistingin the defence of Egypt in the event of an armed aggression upon her or in the event ofthe United Kingdom&apos;s being involved in war as&apos; the result of an armed aggression on the arab countries adjacent to Egypt.(7)    In the event of their returning to Egypt inaccordance with the preceding paragraph, Britishtroops will begin to withdraw from egytian territory immediately upon the cessation ofhostilities.    This withdrawal to be completed by land, sea and air within a period notexceeding three months.(8)    The Treaty of Alliance signed in London on26th August, 1936 together with the AgreedMinute, notes and Convention, also the twoAgreements of 1899 regarding the Sudan tobe abrogated immediately upon the entry intoforce of the new agreement.These are the counter proposals of the Egyptian Government.They are, as the Egyptian side, in the course of talks withField Marshal Slim, The British Ambassador and The late mr., Bevin, has fully and clearly explained, adequate tomeet the international situation.    Indeed they are the only means of clarifying the sombre atmosphere pervadingAnglo-Egyptian relations for the common good of thetwo countries and in the interest of international peace in the Middle East as a whole.
Should the British Government, therefore, recognise -as we hope in all sincerity they will - that British,Egyptian and international interests all call for a speedyacceptance of these proposals as a basis  for settlingoutstanding problems between the two countries and that any delay in dealing with the situation is fraught with graveharm to future Ango-Egyptian relations and to the cause ofinternational peace, then there will be no difficulty in reaching the desired agreement.But if all efforts after this long time prove abortive,the British Government are no doubt aware of Egypt&apos;attitude towards the 1936 Treaty and the 1899 Agreements.This attitude had been frankly and explicitly stated by theEgyptian G&apos;&quot;ernment on many occasions the latest being the speech froir the Throne addressed to the Egyptian parliament in November last.7-
