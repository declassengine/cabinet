secret cabinet. ROTECP.(51) 76The attached paper will beconsidered at the meeting of theCabinet on Monday, 12th March, at10. 0 a. m.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9TH MARCH, 1951.
(THIS-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET, C.P.(51) 769TH MARCH, 1951CABINETPACIFIC defence memorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations at their meeting on 1st March the Cabinet decided to defer con-sideration of the proposed Tripartite Treaty between the United States,Australia and New Zealand (CM.(51) 16th Conclusions, Minute 3).Subsequently a meeting was held under the chairmanship of the PrimeMinister in an attempt to resolve the differences of view among theMinisters concerned.    It was then suggested that a personal messagemight be sent to the Prime Minister of Australia explaining our anxietiesto him frankly.    I have had a draft letter prepared accordingly and attachit as Annex A.COPY NO. *-2. After carefully considering the terms of this draft in the light ofthe previous discussion, I am bound to say that I believe that such a message would seriously damage our relations with Australia.     I havethe following considerations in mind:-(a) However we may phrase it, Australia would regard a message onthese lines as in effect seeking to frustrate their achievement of a security agreement with the United States which mr. Menzies has described as &quot;of the first importance&quot;.We can be in no doubt about the strong feelings which thiswould arouse in Australia.    This is made abundantly clear in the letter from Mr. Menzies which forms Appendix B to cp.(51) 64 and in the memorandum handed by the AustralianResident Minister in London to the Prime Minister on 22ndFebruary (which was circulated to the Cabinet in C.R.O.telegram to Canberra No. 179 of 23rd February).(b) Australia, and New Zealand, will find our attitude difficult tounderstand.     They will recall that in the discussion on theJapanese Peace Treaty at the Meeting of Prime Ministers inJanuary (P.M.M(51) 6th Meeting) it was accepted not only that australia and New Zealand ought to have a guarantee from theUnited States but also that it might take some form of PacificPact.(c) We are unable to make any constructive suggestion as to what might now take the place of the proposed Tripartite Treaty.Wider and more far-reaching conceptions such as an AsianPact are not capable of early realisation.
(d)    We cannot prevent Australia and New Zealand going ahead ifthey wish to and I am sure that they will not be deterred.We do not want them to go ahead in anger.3. I think it right to restate briefly the broad advantages whichwould flow for the United Kingdom from the conclusion of the draftTripartite Treaty:-(a) We know that the Australian Government feel that public opinion in Australia would not allow them to send troops to the middle east unless Australia&apos;s backdoor is bolted by a guarantee.In present circumstances such a guarantee could only be giveneffectively by the United States.    A contribution from australia to the defence of the Middle East is vital to our strategic plans.(b) The Australian representatives at the Meeting of PrimeMinisters repeatedly emphasised that they needed security against future aggression by Japan and they made it clearthat they would not be able to contemplate a Peace Treaty with japan on the lines we want unless they had such security.(c) In the Commonwealth of today it is right that Australia and NewZealand should take the lead in the Pacific.    Indeed by placingsuch responsibilities fairly and squarely on their shoulders weshall encourage Australia to assume a bigger share of thedefence burdens of the Commonwealth.4. Any suggestion by us that the whole nature of the agreement shouldbe reconsidered or that it should be extended to include the United kingdom would endanger the prospects of a United States guarantee by imposing a delay and by re-opening a draft which has already been initialled.    TheTreaty in its present form provides the only prospect of an early guaran-tee by the United States of Australian and New Zealand security.    i suggest therefore that the alternative before us is whether there shouldbe a guarantee in the form of the present Treaty or none at all.    For thereasons which I have indicated in the preceding paragraph, it seems to meclear that it is to our advantage that there should be an early guarantee.5. There is a possibility that the United States Government orSenate might, for quite other reasons, fail to bring the Treaty to com-pletion.    If this were to happen following an attempt by us to secure amaj or revision of the Treaty, there is no doubt that we should be regarded by Australia as having been responsible and our relations with them wouldbe most seriously affected.6. But while we should refrain from pressing for United Kingdomparticipation, there are nevertheless two aspects on which we must do our best to secure that our own wishes are met:-(a)    The inclusion of the Philippines in the proposed Treaty would bevery unfortunate from our point of view.    We should certainlyput our anxieties on this score strongly to Australia and NewZealand and urge them to support us in resisting it.    We must,however, recognise that United States pressure for the inclusionof the Philippines may be irresistible, and in the last resort wemay have to accept it, undesirable as it is, in the wider interests.
(b)    I recognise the danger of a false impression that the UnitedKingdom is retreating from its responsibilities in the pacific.    We should take steps to forestall this.    TheAustralian and New Zealand Governments could help usvery effectively over this and I am sure that, if we backthem over the Treaty, they will do so.    At the appropriate time, concerted statements could then be made by theAustralian and New Zealand Governments as well as our-selves emphasising the strengthening of the arrangementsfor security and mutual support already existing within   theCommonwealth and the closeness of the planning between theUnited Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.7. In shortj I recommend that we should accept the draft TripartiteTreaty as it stands.    We should, however, explain frankLy and fully toAustralia and New Zealand the anxieties which have given us so muchthought, and we should seek their help over the two particular points mentioned in paragraph 6 above.    I attach at Annex B a draft message on these lines to Mr. Menzies.P.C.G.-W.Commonwealth Relations Office,S.W.1,9TH MARCH, 1951.
JOANNEX ADRAFT PERSONAL, MESSAGE TO MR. MENZIESI got back from my visit to Southern Africa last week-end, after a most interesting, but exhausting tour.    I had, of course, kept in touchwith developnents and had followed with very great interest the dis-cussions which you and the New Zealanders had with the Americans aboutthe project for a Defence Pact.This is obviously a development of the first importance, not only for you, but also for us as well.    We certainly take it most seriously andthe Cabinet here had already had the matter in front of them before 1 gotback,    Indeed the sole reason why we have not been able to let you have a reply earlier is that Ministers here wanted time to consider it carefully.This is a very big thing:  we want to help in every way to bring it tofruition with the maximum benefit to the common cause.Let me dispose of one point first.    I was very disturbed to find that there had been some misunderstanding between us about the earlier stages of this business.    If we on our side have done anything in any wayto cause this misunderstanding, then I am very sorry.    It was certainly not our intention to put a spoke in the wheel in any way:  all we were anxiousto do was to let you have our preliminary views at the earliest possible moment so that they could be taken into account before policy was formu&quot;lated.    The memorandum which Harrison gave to the Prime Minister onthe 22nd February shews that your Government feels strongly on a numberof points.    We quite understand your anxieties and I am seeing Harrisonand giving him an aide memoire which deals with these points of detail.On the main issue our objective is the same.    We fully under&quot;stand the defence requirements of Australia and New Zealand and have always been anxious to help you to secure a guarantee of your security bythe United States.     We completely accept your thesis that it is essential for your backdoor to be bolted.    A guarantee by the United States would
make a significant contribution to the strengthening of joint plans for globalstrategy and for the defence of the Middle East, which I know from our recent talks in London is so much in your mind.    In view of what I saybelow, therefore, let there be no mistake that we are fully behind you inyour desire for a defence guarantee from the United States.At the same time, the Cabinet here feel that we should not embark on this new venture without the most careful consideration of the reper-cussions which a Treaty on the lines of the present draft is likely to have:a Treaty of this kind is bound to have an effect on strategy, on international affairs and on Commonwealth relations.The Cabinet still have some real anxieties about the draft in itspresent form and the Prime Minister has authorised me to put our worriesfrankly to you so that we can consider together what best can be done about them.A regional defence system, extending to South-East Asia and theIndian sub-continent and including the islands of the East Indies and the pacific has always been for us a most desirable long-term objective ascompleting the world-wide defence chain of which the North Atlantic treaty was the first link.    We are concerned lest a Treaty setting up a defence council limited to Australia, New Zealand and the United States might setback rather than assist the ultimate achievement of this major objective.The inclusion of the Philippines would make matters even worse from thispoint of view.We also fear that a Treaty in the form as now drafted would have unfortunate political repercussions in the United Kingdom, and perhapsalso in other parts of the Commonwealth.    It does seem to us that thereis a very real danger that, in view of the United Kingdom&apos;s essentialinterest in the Pacific, arising from her Commonwealth connections aswell as her territorial possessions there, such a Treaty might be read as
implying both that the United Kingdom was withdrawing from its propershare of responsibility in the Pacific area and that Australia and NewZealand, in conjunction with the United States, were disinterestingthemselves in territories, and particularly British territories (e. g.Malaya, North Borneo),   in the area of the East Indies.    It might also give the impression that the United Kingdom was being unduly subservientto the United States in the Pacific, which, at a time when public opinion inthe United Kingdom is particularly sensitive on this point in relation to naval appointments in the Atlantic, would not be in the best interests of anglo-American relations.    Indeed, neither of these impressions wouldbe helpful to our common cause, which is why I feel justified in speaking to you so frankly on the subject.    Both of these impressions would in fact be strengthened if the Philippines were included as this would point upthe exclusion of the United Kingdom.I want to put our difficulties frankly to you and I know that youwill reply in the same spirit and let me know what you think.    I do not want to make any official suggestions at this stage and that is why I amsending this personal message.    But the sort of points on which we wouldlike your views are whether there is any way in which the United kingdom could participate in or be associated with the Treaty, and whether theTreaty could be so framed as to form a stepping-stone towards the widerregional organisation we have in mind.    Alternatively could the UnitedStates guarantee take some other form which would get over some of our difficulties ?    In any case, we hope that you will share our views aboutthe Philippines and will feel able to press the United States that theyshould not be included.We do not want to hold matters up, if you feel it imperative togo ahead and if there is any prospect of early endorsement in Washington
of the proposals which Dulles put forward in Canberra.    We wouldlike in due course to exchange views with the United States Admini-stration, but we certainly do not want to say anything to them whichmight have the effect of putting them off in any way.    It is for thisreason that we want to have your views and we will not say anything to Washington until we hear from you.In any case, and however this all comes out, we should certainly hope that it would be possible for both our Governments tomake concerted public statements when the time comes.    In ourstatement we should wish to welcome the Treaty and to make it clearthat we had been fully consulted and considered that our interests were fully safeguarded.    We would hope that both in your statement and in ours emphasis would be laid on the value of the Treaty as a contribution towards Commonwealth security and on the fact that theTreaty is complementary to the understandings of mutual supportbetween Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom which remainso essential a part of our relationship.
ANNEX draft PERSONAL MESSAGE TO MR. MENZIESI got back from my visit to Southern Africa last week-end,after a most interesting, but exhausting tour.    I had, of course, kept in touch with developments and had followed with very great interest the discussions which you and the NewZealanders had with the Americansabout the project for a Defence Pact.This obviously is a development of the first importance, notonly for you, but also for us as well.

Indeed the sole reason why we have not beenable to let you have a reply earlier is that Ministers here wanted timeto consider it carefully.    This is a very big thing and we want to help inevery way to bring it to fruition with the maximum benefit to the common cause.I was very disturbed to find that there had been some misunder-standing between us about the earlier stages of this business.    If we onour side have done anything in any way to cause this misunderstanding,then I am very sorry.    It was certainly not our intention to put a spokein the wheel in any way:  all we were anxious to do was to let you have our preliminary views at the earliest possible moment so that they couldbe taken into account before policy was formulated.    The memorandum which Harrison gave to the Prime Minister on the 22nd Februaryshows that your Government feels strongly on a number of points.    Wequite understand your anxieties and I am seeing Harrison and giving himan aide memoire which deals with these points of detail.I wish to make it clear that we fully understand the defence requirements of Australia and New Zealand and have always been anxious to help you to secure a guarantee of your security b   the United
States.    We completely accept your thesis that it is essential for yourbackdoor to be bolted.    A guarantee by the United States would make a significant contribution to the strengthening of joint plans for globalstrategy and for the defence of the Middle East, which I know from our recent talks in London is so much in your mind.I am, therefore, glad to be able to tell you that the UnitedKingdom Government welcome this development and will, in response to your request, be glad to do their utmost to bring about its adoption.At the same time, there are two important questions of principle which cause us some anxiety.    First, a regional defence system,extending from the Pacific through South-East Asia and South Asia tothe Middle East, is a most desirable long-term objective, as completing the world-wide defence chain of which the North Atlantic Treaty was thefirst link.    In this context, we welcome the conclusion of a PacificPact, but would prefer that it should be confined to the Pacific areaproper, and not extended to the adjoining area of South-East Asia, forinstance, by the inclusion of the Philippines.    To include one countryin the South-East Asian area while excluding others, would raise manyof those difficulties regarding the position of neighbouring territories in that area (e.g. the North Borneo territories and Malaya, as well asIndo-China and Siam) which we found so decisive against the &quot;IslandChain&quot; proposal.    We would, therefore, much prefer to see the whole area of South-East Asia, including the Philippines, left outside the pacific Pact, with the object of including that area in a separate butinterconnected regional Pact as soon as that proves practicable.Our second anxiety is that, in view of the United Kingdom^essential interest in the Pacific, arising from her Commonwealthconnections as well as her&apos;territorial possessions there, the Treaty
-    lfiin its present form might be read as implying that the United kingdom was renouncing its proper share of responsibility in the area.    Again,it might give the impression that the United Kingdom was being undulysubservient to the United States in the Pacific, which, at a time whenpublic opinion in the United Kingdom is particularly sensitive on thispoint in relation to Naval appointments in the Atlantic, would not be inthe best interests of Anglo-American relations.    Indeed, neither ofthese impressions would be helpful to our common cause, which is whyI feel justified in speaking to you so frankly on the subject.    Both ofthese impressions would in fact be strengthened if, while the UnitedKingdom did not participate in the Treaty, the Philippines were permitted to do so.    This consideration, therefore, reinforces the case for theconclusion of a Pacific Treaty without Philippine participation.I hope that you will share our views about the Philippines andwill feel able to press the United States that they should not be included.We ourselves are ready to inform the United States Government that wewould welcome a Treaty on the lines of the present draft.    Indeed inview of the highly important bearing of the question on Anglo-american relations, we should like the agreement of the Australian and New zealand governments to our discussing the whole question with the United StatesGovernment equally frankly and letting them know our views as set out above.    In particular, as you know, the overall strategic plans, into which the proposed Treaty seems to fit so well, were worked out inconsultation with the United States Chiefs of Staff and we should there-fore like to confirm with them that they share our view.    We shall,of course, not say anything to the Americans until we hear from you.I expect that your experts are looking into the detaileddrafting.    There is one point which occurs to us.     The Treaty as at
present drafted does not contain any definition of the area over whichit would operate, and I wonder if you have any comments on this.When the time comes, we would, of course, wish to statepublicly the attitude of the United Kingdom Government, welcomingthe Treaty and making it clear that we had been consulted throughoutand that we considered that our interests were fully safeguarded.This should, incidentally, dispel any misapprehensions such as I have mentioned above about our continued interest in the Pacific area.It would help us greatly from this point of view if both our Governments,and the New Zealand Government also, were to make concerted state-ments laying emphasis on the value of the Treaty as a contribution towards Commonwealth security and on the fact that it is comple-mentary to the understandings of mutual support between Australia;New Zealand and the United Kingdom which remain so essential a partof our relationship.    I hope that you will agree that such statementsshould be made at the appropriate moment.
