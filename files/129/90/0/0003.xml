C.(57) 253 COPY N0.4l4*30th October, 1957CABINETNUCLEAR POWER:  I.B.R.D. LOANMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 12th September I reported that it was clear that a loan from theInternational Bank, for Research and Development (I.B.R.D.) for ournuclear power programme could not be made available without the participation of the New York market.    In the light of this, I was authorised to explore further, without commitment, the possibility of a loan for this purpose from the I.B.R.D. and the terms on which it might beavailable (C. C. (57) 67th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. Accordingly I pursued the matter with the President of the Bankwhile I was in Washington last month. In response to my enquiries hesaid that:-(i)  He would be willing to make a loan for local currency expenditure(that is, for expenditure on the programme within the United Kingdom)provided that there was market participation to help to justify this.(ii) He thought $50 millions was about the most the United kingdom might hope to borrow from the market in the first instance. This wasa very respectable amount and much more than other Governments had raised in New York since the war.(iii)    For his part he would be willing to recommend to his executive board that the Bank should match this borrowing with another$ 50 millions.(iv) As for future years, there was no reason why there should not berepeat performances.    The amounts would depend on the circumstancesof the time.    If this year*s market borrowing was a success (and he wouldnot recommend market borrowing unless success was assured) themarket might be willing next year tw put up a larger sum.(v) The period of the loan might be for 20 or 25 years (that is, untilthe final maturity).    Repayments need not begin until the power stations were in operation and beginning to earn revenue.3.     I did not go into details about interest rates, as these will naturally be affected by the precise date at which any loan agreementcomes into effect.    But it is material to note that recent I.B.R. D.loans have been at 5f per cent, whereas the rate of interest on long-term Exchequer advances now being made to our nationalised industries is 6 per cent.    As regards the market participation, it would be for theUnited Kingdom to discuss this with our advisers in the United States,keeping in touch with the I.B.R.D.-1-SECRET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
P.T.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.29th October, 1957.-2-4.     It is clear that thie I.B.R.D. lending in conjunction with theNew York market represents the only real chance we have of getting any new fortification for the reserves and at the same time augmenting ourcapital resources by borrowing from overseas, and that even this possibility is likely to be lost if 1 am not put in a position to arrange forfirm negotiations to be opened without delay.    The President of theI.B.R.D. will be visiting London again about the first week in November,and it is highly desirable that this opportunity should be taken to putmatters in train.5.     1 am sure that we should seek this loan.    If we are successful itwould mean receipts of dollars over the next two or three years whichwould be a very valuable offset to the outgoings necessary to meet ourdebt obligations, to which I referred in my paper C. (57) 230.    We are inno position to forego this relief.6.     I therefore recommend that authority be given for the opening of formal negotiations with the I.B.R.D. with a view to a loan of $50 millions to the nationalised electricity supply industry towards their nuclear power programme, in conjunction with negotiations for a further loan of$50 millions from the New York market.
