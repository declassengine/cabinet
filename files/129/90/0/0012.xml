secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1957C. (57) 262 Copy No.15th November, 1957CABINETMALTA: CONSTITUTIONAL development memorandum by Secretary of State for the ColoniesDecision of principle the Malta Round Table Conference recommended, and the government accepted in principle in March 1956, that Malta should be represented by three members in the next United Kingdom Parliament, provided that the Maltese people showed, in a general election, that they wanted this. It was agreed at thesame time that there should be a new Constitution for Malta to provide localautonomy for the Maltese Parliament, save on defence, external affairs and alimited number of other matters which would remain the sole and exclusiveresponsibility of Westminster.Phasing of Legislation2. The original plan was that the new Constitution should come into effectbefore the next Maltese general election. Mr. Mintoff, the Prime Minister of Malta,now accepts that, although the Integration Bill should be passed through all its stages, its provisions should not come into operation and the new constitution should not be made under it until that election has been held. The question,however, arises whether the Integration Bill should be so framed that its provisions would come into effect automatically on the passing of a resolution by the newMaltese Parliament by whatever majority, even a single vote. The maltese government strongly press that the Bill should come into effect on the passing ofa resolution and I am inclined to agree with this view.Financial Arrangements3. It will be recalled that the talks with the Maltese Government last Julyresulted in a Memorandum of Agreement (C. (57) 183) under which Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment recognise and support the ultimate aim of the Maltese Governmentthat, after a reasonable period of years, Malta should reach an economy andstandard of living comparable to that of the United Kingdom and it will be opento the Maltese Government after a period of 12-15 years to request that theireconomy becomes an integral part of the United Kingdom on the Northern Irelandpattern. The appropriate clauses to give effect to this Agreement will be includedin the Integration Bill.Constitutional Arrangements4. Throughout the negotiations since March 1956 the Maltese have maintained that the new constitutional arrangements must reflect equality of statusfor Malta and its people. The Maltese people could not be asked to accept thatMalta should be associated with the United Kingdom by half measures or in away which showed grudging acceptance by the United Kingdom of the RoundTable Conference idea. Mr. Mintoff has from the start made clear his view thatthis involves making provision in the new Bill for Malta to become part of theUnited Kingdom. The recent talks with him proceeded on this assumption onstatus though without any form of commitment on the United Kingdom side.52585b
Subject to that, agreement was reached with the Maltese delegation on the main features of the proposed new constitutional arrangements, as set out in Annex A.The whole of these arrangements is, of course, contingent on a satisfactory solutionbeing found on the matter of Malta&apos;s future status. But as there are a number of points in them which have a bearing on the question of status, or which may appear to raise other difficulties, I draw my colleagues&apos; attention to them before i discuss possible solutions of the status question.Affirmations5. The first of these points which has a bearing on status is the effect of theproposed affirmations concerning the enactment by the Parliament at Westminsterof laws for Malta, described in paragraphs (2) and (3) of Annex A. So far as thefirst affirmation is concerned, there is a precedent for the part relating to thestatus of Malta as part of the United Kingdom (if this is agreed) in Section 1 (2)of the Ireland Act, 1949 (which affirmed that Northern Ireland would not cease tobe part of the United Kingdom without the consent of the Parliament of NorthernIreland). There is no precedent for the remainder of the affirmation, but the maltese Prime Minister has pressed the view that the Integration Act will giveeffect to mutually agreed &quot; articles of union &quot; which ought not to be altered withoutthe further agreement of both parties. As a general proposition, this appears tome to be sound and convincing.6. As regards the second affirmation, fears have been expressed that if it became necessary to amend it, difficulties might arise with members of theCommonwealth since the question would then be raised whether the UnitedKingdom Parliament could amend the preamble and Section 4 of the Statute of westminster (see Annex B) and similar provisions in subsequent Independence Acts.There is, however, no real parallel between the Statute of Westminster and thisaffirmation; and, in order to emphasise the difference, it could be made clear inthe Integration Act that the affirmation can be amended with Maltese consent andso long as such consent were obtained it does not seem that an amendment wouldgive rise to these difficulties with the Commonwealth. Moreover it will not benecessary to amend the affirmation when, for example, the economy of Malta isintegrated with that of the United Kingdom and it becomes necessary for theUnited Kingdom Parliament to be able to legislate freely for Malta on matters such as income tax.7. It has to be recognised that the second affirmation may lead to demands for similar provision to be made by Parliament in future with respect to other overseas territories. The Government of the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland, for example, which has hitherto been content with assurances fromthe United Kingdom Government about the enactment of legislation by parliament for the Federation, may reopen this question when the affirmation relating to Maltais enacted. We shall have to face this pressure if and when it arises and, if it isessential to resist it, rely, as we shall have to on other aspects of the integrationplan, on the argument that Malta is unique.Equality of Maltese Abroad8. Another point which affects the question of status is the Maltese contention that once Malta becomes part of the United Kingdom and Maltese are &quot; first-class &quot;citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, it would be wrong if they were treated by other countries differently from other citizens resident in the UnitedKingdom. Mr. Mintoff has therefore asked for an assurance regarding the actionHer Majesty&apos;s Government will take to ensure that equal treatment is accorded.What he has principally in mind is restrictions on Maltese immigration by theUnited States, Australia and Canada. It has been explained to Mr. Mintoff thatwhile we sympathise with his point of view and even now it is our policy that allcitizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies without distinction should be treatedequally, we cannot oblige other countries to change or interpret their laws and practices. It has also been explained that in member countries of theCommonwealth, the policy in such matters is entirely for the Governments ofthose countries and, if any questions arise, they are dealt with in discussion betweenthe Governments concerned.
9. I therefore propose that, in reply to a letter from Mr. Mintoff, asking her majesty&apos;s Government to use her best endeavours with members of theCommonwealth and foreign countries to ensure to Malta and its people afterintegration like treatment to that accorded to United Kingdom citizens resident in the United Kingdom, I should say something on the following lines: -&quot; As you are aware, Her Majesty&apos;s Government has a special relationship with the Commonwealth countries. The immigration programme of eachCommonwealth country is solely for that country to determine. Anyadaptations or modifications of policy would be a matter for discussion throughthe normal channels of communication. So far as foreign countries areconcerned, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would continue to use her best endeavours to persuade them to treat Malta and its people on terms of equality.&quot;Status of Malta10. Apart from the question of equality of status with the United Kingdom,the Maltese Government attach great importance to having an explicit provision in the Bill to make Malta part of the United Kingdom, for a number of reasons.As Malta must no longer be a Colony, a new status is needed and Northern Irelandprovides the closest analogy. It is also argued that certain practical consequenceswill flow from making Malta a part of the United Kingdom e.g., as regards Malteseimmigration into the United States. We have explained to Mr. Mintoff that it is thereality of the constitutional relationship which will count and not any descriptivetitle. But he is nonetheless convinced that the title is of fundamental importancein presenting the new arrangements to the Maltese people and hence in ensuring that they are made to work as the Round Table Conference envisaged.11. Several anomalies and difficulties arise out of any method of makingMalta part of the United Kingdom. An important difficulty concerns the RoyalStyle and Title. My colleagues in the Malta Committee felt that a change in theRoyal Style should, if at all possible, be avoided, particularly as any such change would require prior consultation with Commonwealth countries. I accept this view and Mr. Mintoff would not press the contrary view. The Malta Committee threwout the idea that, in order to make Malta part of the United Kingdom, she mightbe made part of Great Britain. This has been looked into by officials who advise that there are geographical and legal objections and that our purpose in avoiding a change in the Royal Style could better be achieved within the terms of the original proposal, as explained in the following paragraph.12. Apart from the question of the Royal Style, it is necessary for any provision making Malta part of the United Kingdom to indicate what the futuretitles of the United Kingdom and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom areto be and what construction is to be placed upon references to the United kingdom in Acts of Parliament passed and public documents issued after the provision comes into force. Officials have worked out alternative drafts of clauses which have theeffect of making Malta part of the United Kingdom, but avoiding a change in theRoyal Style. These are given in Annex C, with a description of their implications.It will be seen that the longer of the drafts expressly alters the title of the UnitedKingdom and the Parliament of the United Kingdom; but also expressly debarsalteration of the Royal Style. The shorter version avoids alteration of either theRoyal Style or the title of Parliament by simply providing for &quot; the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland &quot; to be construed as includingMalta. The advantage of the longer version is that it goes as far as possibletowards meeting the aspirations of the Maltese people by recognising openly thefact of union with us. On the other hand, it may stimulate more opposition inParliament here and it draws attention to the anomaly of not altering the RoyalStyle and Title. The shorter version appears to avoid these objections, but by adevice which may in itself be considered anomalous, and which is patently lessattractive to the Maltese people.13. It appears that there are no insuperable legal difficulties in the way of including Malta in the United Kingdom without changing the Royal Style. TheBritish Constitution is flexible enough to embrace any anomalies that might arise.I am aware of the argument that the degree of autonomy which will be given tothe Maltese Parliament under the arrangements described in Annex A goes52585
beyond that enjoyed by Northern Ireland but it is fully consistent with therecommendations of the Malta Round Table Conference and is in fact based onconvenience, not on principle. Many of the anomalies in the present situation will disappear in any case if and when Malta should take up the option to integrateits economic and financial arrangements with those of the United Kingdom as provided for in the Memorandum of Agreement (C. (57) 183).Recommendation14. I believe it is both necessary and desirable that the fullest and mostexplicit expression should be given in the new arrangements to Malta&apos;s equality of status with us.   I therefore recommend that (i) the question of status should be settled by agreeing to make Malta partof the United Kingdom on the lines of the longer version inAlternative I of Annex C;(ii) the drafting of legislation embodying the new constitutional arrangements in Annex A should now be authorised so that the Bill can be introduced in this session and passed through all its stages by next summer;(iii) an exchange of letters about the treatment abroad of Maltese on the linesof paragraph 9 should be agreed; and(iv) the Maltese Government should be informed without delay of our decisions.A. L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.1,12th November, 1957.Annex ASUMMARY OF MAIN FEATURES OF PROPOSEDCONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS(1) The Bill will provide for the representation of Malta in the next UnitedKingdom Parliament, for the delimitation of three constituencies in Malta, andfor the application to Malta of the United Kingdom laws regarding elections.(2) There will be an affirmation in the body of the Bill to the effect that thestatus of Malta and representation at Westminster will not be diminished withoutMaltese consent. (The extent, if any, to which other provisions of the IntegrationAct will be amendable without Maltese consent remains for further consideration.)(3) There will be a second affirmation in the body of the Bill declaring theUnited Kingdom Parliament^ intention not to legislate for Malta in matters withinthe competence of the Maltese Parliament without Maltese consent except for the fulfilment of the United Kingdom&apos;s responsibilities for defence and external affairs or with respect to certain other matters, e.g., civil aviation, coinage and currency.(The Maltese Parliament will be able to legislate for these other matters but it willbe prescribed that Maltese Bills relating to them must be reserved for Her Majesty&apos;pleasure.)(4) The Bill will also confer power on Her Majesty (a) during a period of two and a half years from the date of its coming intooperation, to make provision for Malta by Order in Council with respectto defence and external affairs mainly for the purpose of adaptingexisting legislation in force in Malta and applying to Malta with modifications legislation in force in the United Kingdom; and(b) to make provision for Malta by Order in Council in case of urgency withrespect to defence and external affairs.Both these powers will be subject to appropriate provisions requiring an affirmative resolution of each House of Parliament.
(5) The Bill will enable a new constitution to be established for Malta byOrder in Council.(6) Under the new constitution, the diarchy in the form of the Maltese ImperialGovernment will disappear but Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ responsibilities for defence, &amp;c, in Malta will be carried on by a United Kingdom representative in malta.(7) The Queen&apos;s Representative in Malta will be obliged to act in accordancewith the advice of Maltese Ministers in the exercise of his powers except as regardsreservation of Bills.(8) The Maltese Parliament will have power to legislate on all matters except those specified in a Schedule of excluded matters, of which the main items will bedefence, external communications, certain matters relating to the Crown, andnationality.(9) The executive authority of the Maltese Government will not extend to matters outside the legislative competence of the Maltese Parliament or to external affairs. It is proposed, however, that the United Kingdom Government shoulddelegate, subject to the overriding control of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, certainexecutive powers in the field of external affairs to the Maltese Government, notablyto negotiate and conclude trade agreements with neighbouring countries.(10) The Constitution will in general be amendable by an Act of the MalteseParliament passed by a two-thirds majority, but will not be amendable by Act ofthe United Kingdom Parliament without Malta&apos;s consent.(11) Where any Maltese enactment is inconsistent with an Act of parliament or subordinate legislation passed or made after the date of coming into operationof the Integration Act, the Maltese enactment will, to the extent of the inconsistency,be void. But the Maltese Parliament will be given power to amend or repeal acts of Parliament and subordinate legislation passed or made before that date in so faras they have effect as part of the law of Malta and relate to matters within thelegislative competence of the Maltese Parliament.(12) The responsible Secretary of State will have power to require the Queen&apos;representative not to assent to a Bill passed by the Maltese Parliament but to reserve it for Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure if the Bill appears to the Secretary of state to impinge on the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government for defence and external affairs. The Queen&apos;s Representative must, in the absence of a direction to the contrary from the Secretary of State, reserve for Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure any bill relating to certain other matters, e.g., civil aviation, coinage and currency. are served Bill must be submitted for Her Majesty&apos;s assent unless within 60 &quot; sitting &quot;days each House of Parliament resolves that it should not be so submitted.(13) The Bill will provide for the establishment of machinery for consultation between the United Kingdom and the Maltese Govrnments on matters of jointconcern.Annex BPROVISIONS IN STATUTE OF WESTMINSTER1. The recital in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster states that&quot; it is in accord with the established constitutional position that no law hereaftermade by the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall extend to any of the saidDominions as part of the law of that Dominion otherwise than at the request andwith the consent of that Dominion &quot; is in substance to the same effect.2. The corresponding provision in the body (Section 4) of the Statute of westminster is expressed as a provision dealing with the interpretation of Acts ofParliament; it reads &quot; No Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed afterthe commencement of this Act shall extend, or be deemed to extend, to a Dominionas part of the law of that Dominion unless it is expressly declared in that Act thatthat Dominion has requested, and consented to, the enactment thereof.&quot; the marginal note to the section, however, reads &quot; Parliament of United Kingdomnot to legislate for Dominion except by consent.&quot;
Annex CSTATUS OF MALTAAlternative DraftsAlternative I(1) Subject to the provisions in this section, the Island of Malta shall, as fromthe appointed day, be included in the territories comprised in the United kingdom which shall be known and styled accordingly as the United Kingdom of GreatBritain, Northern Ireland and Malta.(2) Subsection(l) of section two of the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act,1927 (which specifies the title of Parliament), so far as it relates to the title of the parliament current at the appointed day and subsequent Parliaments, and subsection (2) of that section (which provides for the interpretation of theexpression &quot; United Kingdom &quot;), so far as it applies to enactments passed andpublic documents issued after that day, shall have effect as if for the words &quot; GreatBritain and Northern Ireland &quot; there were substituted the words &quot; Great Britain,Northern Ireland and Malta.&quot;(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring or authorising any amendment of Her Majesty&apos;s royal style and title.(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as extending to Malta any enactment or instrument or rule of law which does not extend to Malta immediately before the appointed day, or as affecting the construction of any reference to theUnited Kingdom in any enactment (other than section two of the Royal and parliamentary Titles Act, 1927) passed before that day, or in any instrumentmade before that day.(5) Unless the contrary intention appears therein enactments of the Parliamentof the United Kingdom passed on or after the appointed day shall be deemed notto extend to Malta.Alternative II(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, the Island of Malta shall, as fromthe appointed day, be included among the territories comprised in the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and any reference to the UnitedKingdom, or to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, inany enactment passed or public document issued on or after that day shall beconstrued accordingly.(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed as extending to Malta any enactment or instrument passed or made before the appointed day, or any rule of law in force immediately before that day, or as otherwise affecting theoperation in relation to Malta of any such enactment, instrument or rule of law.(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting, in relation toenactments passed on or after the appointed day, any presumption of law withrespect to the territorial extent of enactments of the Parliament of the UnitedKingdom.NOTESThe longer version, in Alternative I above, provides that the future title ofthe United Kingdom shall include an express mention of Malta and expresslyamends section 2 of the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927, so as to makea similar alteration to the future title of Parliament and so as to include Malta,unless the context otherwise requires, in the meaning of references to the UnitedKingdom in future Acts and public documents. Although there is someinconsistency in not making a corresponding alteration to the Royal Style andTitle, subsection (3) expressly excludes any need for any such alteration.Subsections (4) and (5) respectively provide that the operation of existing law inrelation to Malta is not affected and preserve for the future the presumption thatActs of Parliament extend only to the United Kingdom as at present constituted,and corresponding provision is made in subsections (2) and (3) of the shorter versionin II above.
The object of the shorter version in Alternative II is to produce a situation inwhich it is unnecessary either to alter the Royal Style and Title or to provideexpressly against the necessity for alteration. The words at the end of subsection (1)of this draft accordingly are designed to serve a dual purpose.In the first place they operate to amend subsection (2) of section two of theRoyal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927. This is done obliquely, but the effectundoubtedly is that the words &quot; United Kingdom &quot; when used in a future Act wouldmean Malta as well as Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Secondly, the words in question do something to indicate which way to answer the question (so far left open by the proposition that Malta is to be included amongthe territories of the United Kingdom) what is the proper future title of the UnitedKingdom? The assumption underlying the words at the end of the subsection mustbe that&quot; the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland &quot; will continueto be used in Acts of Parliament and official documents, and the effect of the wordsis that when they are so used Malta is included without express mention.It follows from the second proposition just set out that in the shorter versionin Alternative II it is strictly unnecessary to include a subsection disclaimingamendment of the Royal Style and Title, and the same applies to the title ofParliament. It would, on the other hand, be quite appropriate, if desired, to include a subsection on the lines of subsection (3) of the longer version in Alternative I, butexpanded so as to cover the Parliamentary title as well.
