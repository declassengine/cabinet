secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPEJRTY. ,QF^.HER, BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet]   November 1.957C. (57) 26813th November, 1957CABINETMALTA: THE NAVAL DOCKYARDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the problem of the dockyard in Malta can be looked at from two points ofview. There is the question of defence expenditure and the interests of the Malteseeconomy.  This paper deals with the second aspect.2. The dockyard is in effect Malta&apos;s only industry. It provides direct employment for nearly 12,000 including most of the skilled and best-paid workersin the Island. The largest private industry is a brewery employing 400. There areonly ten other establishments employing more than 100 people each.3. The contribution from dockyard employment and other Royal Navyexpenditure in Malta to Malta&apos;s National Income is  IT4 millions. expenditure by the other Service Departments in Malta totals  8-3 millions. In addition,Her Majesty&apos;s Government are currently contributing  6 millions towards Malta&apos;sbudgetary deficit. This goes mainly towards capital expenditure on the basicservices (water, electricity, harbour, &amp;c), which must be developed in order to attract industries to Malta. All this income provides the source for most of Malta&apos;sancillary business which in its turn makes up virtually the whole balance of thecountry&apos;s national income.4. The net product of Malta&apos;s agriculture is only about  2 millions. Thereis no other natural product of any significance. The only other large employer is the Maltese Government, employing about 14,000 people. This employment ofcourse depends on the revenue they receive from taxation. Maltese government expenditure is currently  15-7 millions, of which  8-2 millions comes from taxation. As indicated above, the sources of money on which this tax revenuedepends arise by and large out of dockyard employment, Services expenditure and Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ contribution to the Budget.5. Malta&apos;s livelihood thus depends in a unique way on the dockyard, and ifthis is to be closed or substantially run down, Malta faces economic ruin, and couldnot sustain anything approaching its present population of 315,000. Emigrationis a possible long-term solution, but it is essentially that, particularly as the majorreceiving countries, e.g., United States and Australia, impose very severe limitations on immigration from Malta which may not be affected by making Malta part ofthe United Kingdom. The introduction of alternative industries may help in due course, but the building up of alternative employment will be very difficult andslow, and nothing spectacular can be expected in the foreseeable future. The fact is that Malta has no natural resources other than its fortress position, the potentialskill of the work-people, and possible, though this is largely speculative, oil.6. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are already committed by the July declarationof 1955 to work together with the Maltese to avoid unemployment, to diversifythe economy, and to raise the standard of living. In the Memorandum ofAgreement on economic and financial arrangements consequent upon the new constitutional status (C. (57) 183), which it is proposed should come into force with the new Constitution after a General Election in Malta in, say, October 1958,Her Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed that if as a consequence of any drasticchange in Imperial defence policy affecting Malta, &quot; the level of unemploymentCopy No.52584
in Malta should reach and for six months remain at a higher level than the rateof unemployment in the United Kingdom at the time, the United KingdomGovernment would be willing to assist the Maltese Government in taking remedial measures to be agreed,&quot; The closure or substantial running down of the dockyardwould undoubtedly bring this obligation into effect.7. The cost of complete closure would appear prohibitive until such time as alternative measures could if possible be worked out and brought into effect.An indication of what is involved is contained in a paper prepared by the maltese government, with which I hesitate to burden my colleagues but copies areavailable if required.8.   At the same time, I recognise that the state of affairs outlined above,which in a sense holds Her Majesty&apos;s Government to ransom, is most undesirable.We are therefore proposing to do what we can to encourage the establishment ofnew industry and tourism in Malta, and have encouraged the establishment of theIndustrial Advisory Committee headed by Lord Hives, which was announced on 6th November. This Committee will no doubt put forward some earlyrecommendations about financial inducements to industry, and will bring to a headany outstanding negotiations, e.g., for the construction of an oil refinery or drydocks. We are, of course, committed to provide capital grants amounting to  25millions over a period of five years and percentage grants for education and social services, particularly education which should, but only in the long term, makeemigration easier.9. In time these measures might lead to an easing of the situation and allow a transfer of employment from the dockyard. It cannot be contemplated that anysubstantial run-down of employment in the dockyard could be brought abouthowever for many years.10. I, therefore, recommend my colleagues to agree that in so far as thefuture of the naval dockyard in Malta is concerned, the Admiralty should beauthorised to work out plans for the retention of employment in the dockyard atmuch the present level. We could then consider adjusting these plans if themeasures outlined above are successful in creating alternative employment.A. L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.1,12th November, 1957.
