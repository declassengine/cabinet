(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 01:&apos; HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)12th November, 1957CABINETEGYPTNote &quot;by the Prime MinisterWe hold, the following assets &quot;belonging to the egyptian government:No. 2 Aocount:    About  53 millions net.No. 1 Account; (ordinary):     18 millions (it is in fact 26 millions out  8 millions are earmarked for agreedpurposes - mostly to our advantage.Both these are &quot;blocked.No. 1 Special Account:    This is the in-and-out of the canal dues.2.      Our claims against the Egyptians fall into two categories:(a)    Egyptianised or nationalised property - ahout 100 millions.This includes  55 millions for the shell Refinery.(&quot;b)    Sequestrated property, valued &quot;by the owners at ahout 60 millions: thought &quot;by the Egyptians tohe too high; pro&quot;ba&quot;bly is too high.Proposal3.     We give them  18 millions - that is the money in theNo. 1 Aocount, for their own use.    They give us  X millions from the No. 2 Account for us to use as we think fit ascompensation.    It would &quot;be for us to say how far this shouldhe spread to meet sequestrated, property and how far used forEgyptianised property.    We have suggested  37 millions for X.    The Egyptians appear to have offered  25 millions.    Itis proposed to instruct our delegation to get the most theycan hut not &quot;below  30 millions *COPY NO.
4*      In addition the Egyptians undertake to desequestratethe property they have seized.      The owners will then go &quot;back and either sell it - if it is furniture or house accommodation?or live in it if they have business to doj    or, if it is a business asset, try to carry on or sell it to somebody else.5.     Of course the snag is that however the owners sell outthey will not be able to transfer the Egyptian currency unless this is provided for in the agreement.6.      Finally, if this agreement goes through it will releaseus from the obligation to release  20 millions from the No. 2Account.H. M.10, Downing Street, S.W.1.12th November, 1957.
