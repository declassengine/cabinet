THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1957The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. It is issued for the personal use of...................... ................................TOP SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 258.4th November, 1957CABINETCYPRUSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe Minister of State for the colonies the Sub-Commission of the European Commission on Human Rights,referred to in CP. (56) 152, have been considering the Greek allegations that incertain respects our actions in Cyprus are in breach of the European human rights Convention and decided on 6th September that before they could concludetheir report they wished to carry out investigations in Cyprus. The matters tobe investigated are:  (a) the existence and extent of a public danger threatening the life of theNation. (The existence of such a public danger is required underarticle 15 of the Convention in order to justify the detention of personswithout trial. The extent of the public danger is relevant since theSub-Commission are entitled to decide that it exists but that some ofthe Emergency measures are extreme and unnecessary);(b) the circumstances in which the curfew regulations are applied.The Sub-Commission have indicated by way of clarification that they desire to hear evidence not only from the Government but also from the representatives ofthe communities in Cyprus.2. The report will be sent to the Commission on Human Rights, which will in turn report to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, who havepower under the Convention to make binding recommendations by a two-thirds majority. We are advised that the Sub-Commission are within their rights in deciding to visit Cyprus, and that there would be no advantage in seeking toprevent or even to defer the visit on purely legal grounds. Despite such argumentsas we might deploy, it is virtually certain that the Sub-Commission will stand bytheir decision-and they have indicated as much in writing and that an attempt on our part to change their mind would be resented and might tell against us when the report was being prepared. It is true that since the Sub-Commissionmade their decision there has been a renewal of terrorist activity, though not on alarge scale. Further, a surrendered terrorist has revealed documents exposingEOKA&apos;s plans and preparedness for renewed violence. Nevertheless we are advised that to proffer this new proof of public danger would be most unlikely todeflect the Sub-Commission from their decision.3. We have to decide whether we are going to allow the investigatingCommittee into Cyprus or not.4.. A further important and relevant fact is that the Human RightsCommission have now admitted as prima facie suitable for further examinationtwenty-nine cases in which the Greeks allege ill-treatment of persons in Cyprus,
contrary to the Convention. Our attitude to the present decision of theSub-Commission may serve as a strong, although not necessarily an irresistible,precedent if and when the &quot; atrocities &quot; case reaches the same stage. As mattersstand we have been given two months for the preparation of our written, pleadingon these cases; if an oral hearing followed, as is likely, a longer period would elapse.5. The Governor, Sir John Harding, recognises the disadvantage of rejecting the Sub-Commission&apos;s decision. He is convinced, however, that substantialdangers would be involved in accepting the decision unconditionally at the presenttime. Copies of telegrams exchanged with him are attached. In brief, herepresents that unconditional acceptance would involve a loss of British prestige in Cyprus in that the Greek Cypriots would be elated and conversely the TurkishCypriots exasperated by the apparent British weakness; that the effect on the two communities in Cyprus would be reflected in Greece and Turkey with correspondingrepercussions on the possibility of rational discussion of the Cyprus question inthe General Assembly of the United Nations, or elsewhere; that, because ofterrorist intimidation and lying witnesses the Sub-Commission would be unlikely to reach the truth; and that the visit might well lead to violence and bloodshed,particularly on the part of the Turkish community.6. The Governor is particularly concerned at the prospect of an investigationon the present issues serving as a precedent for a local investigation of &quot; atrocities.&quot;Such a possibility he views with the gravest concern since it would raise in anaggravated form the disadvantages mentioned above, and in addition would havethe most serious effect on the morale of the security forces. There is little doubtthat Sir John Harding would consider that an investigation of this kind ought tobe rejected outright.7. We consider below alternative courses of action:(i). Immediate direct appeal to the Committee of Ministers over the heads ofthe Sub-Commission and the Commission: This course is stronglyadvocated by Sir John Harding on the grounds that it is intolerablethat the Greek Government should be able to pervert the spirit of the human Rights Convention to put us in the dock, on charges whichcould never have been brought forward but for the Greek Government^encouragement of armed rebellion. There is, however, nothing in theConvention which envisages such a direct appeal: the Committee ofMinisters- would be likely to refuse to interfere with proceedings stillin the hands of the Sub-Commission. Further, we should be at a serioustactical disadvantage with the Committee because our appeal could onlysucceed if we had the support of two-thirds of the members, and incertain circumstances the unanimous vote of the Committee would berequired. We should have to deploy our political arguments prematurelyand sacrifice the advantage (which, at the ultimate stage in the normal course of events we should enjoy as &quot; defendants &quot;) of requiring onlythe support of more than one-third of the Committee to block anyadverse decision.(ii) Rejection of the Sub-Commission&apos;s request:  The practical and political arguments outlined in paragraph 5 above could be used to explain a refusal. On the other hand we should be in breach of the convention and would incur odium on that account. The Sub-Commission would continue with their report and in the end might be more likely to findagainst us on the substance of the question. The refusal would be embarrassing in the United Nations where in previous Cyprus debateswe have taken a strong line on the sanctity of treaties. We might,however unfairly, be compared to the Russians in the case of Hungary.We might try to make the refusal look better by saying that we would undertake to review the position later with the object of admitting theSub-Commission if the situation in Cyprus had by then improved; butwe consider that this would be regarded by everyone including theSub-Commission as a mere device to cover up a refusal.(iii) Unconditional acceptance: This would be the normal course and wouldbe of assistance to us when the substance of. the case eventually came before the Committee of Ministers. The objections are those given inparagraphs 5 and 6. t
(iv) Acceptance subject to specific political conditions: e.g., that the GreekGovernment which has been responsible for stimulating terrorism largely directed against Greek Cypnots which is the negation of the human rights the Convention exists to protect, should denounce violencein Cyprus and curb their propaganda. Any such conditions are unlikelyof satisfactory fulfilment. There is no legal provision for such a procedure and the Sub-Commission would almost certainly regard anysuch conditions as a disguised outright rejection. If the Sub-Commissionthemselves decline to accept our stipulation, we should then still eitherhave to accept or reject their request and to accept in thesecircumstances would be doubly embarrassing.(v) Acceptance without conditions, but playing for time: i.e., negotiating tosecure that the best possible arrangements on timing and procedure are reached. We could indicate to the Sub-Commission that while we accept their proposed visit in principle, we had to consider not onlyour responsibility to them for the practical arrangements connected withthe visit, but also our wider responsibility for the maintenance of lawand order in Cyprus. We could expect to gain an interval in whichdevelopments might occur; e.g., if international discussions had begun,we might perhaps though this is rather unlikely persuade theSub-Commission not to proceed with its proposal. In the end, however,we should, unless any really plausible reasons arise in. the interval for refusing the investigation, have to admit the investigation.8. Course (ii) above is the most attractive. Such a decision, however, wouldbe used with great effect against us in the United Nations debate on Cyprus. Itwould be construed as an admission of guilt on the atrocity cases also. It would damage our reputation in the Council of Europe and among Europeanparliamentarians, at an awkward moment in view of the wider issues now beingdebated. Therefore after carefully considering the alternatives we have reluctantly-reached the conclusion that we should adopt the fifth alternative described above and accept the Sub-Commission&apos;s request to go, but play for time when it goes.We would wish to use such reasons as the change over of Governors to postponeany arrival until; say, the New Year. There seems to be a reasonable chance,particularly as we understand that the Sub-Commission dees not at present have in mind an earlier date for the visit than the end of November, that we could succeed in this, by which time we might conceivably have made progress in negotiations and the United Nations debate should be out of the way. Furthermore, if therewere a recrudescence of widespread violence in the interim, it would give us newgrounds for reconsideration. If we did follow this course, we might consider asking the Committee of Ministers to appeal for the renunciation of violence in the Island,though not making this a condition of our acceptance of the Sub-Commissiongoing. We may be able to manoeuvre in this way to the embarrassment of theGreek Government.9. We must emphasise to the Cabinet that if this investigation on the spotis accepted it will not dispose in any way of the more serious possibility of subsequent investigation into alleged &apos;k atrocities.&apos;&quot; That case will take its normal course and we expect to be faced, in about two or three months&apos; time, with thedecision whether to allow another local investigation on that account. It mightbe more difficult to resist an investigation on the spot on the &quot; atrocities&quot;application if one had been admitted on the first application particularly if the first investigation has passed off without incident and has resultedin a fair report. On the other hand, the United Nations Assembly will notbe in session, and there may have been other developments. We are agreedabout the effect on the morale of the security forces of such an investigation. Wehave already refused a Parliamentary demand for one. Our present strong viewtherefore is that we should have to refuse or prevent such an investigation, althoughobviously that decision must be completely weighed when the application is made and in the light of conditions at the time.Recommendation10. Her Majesty&apos;s Government should accept the Sub-Commission&apos;s request to visit Cyprus but negotiate to secure that the best possible arrangements in timing and procedure are reached in consultation with the Governor of Cyprus.Jst November, 1957.S. L.P.
ANNEX :EXCHANGE OF TELEGRAMS  BETWEEN  THE  COLONIAL  OFFICEAND THE GOVERNOR OF cyprus to Cyprus\13th September, 1957No. 1544For Harding from Profumo.Greek Applications to Council of Europe Human Rights Commission.As you know things are not going too badly as regards Application allegingatrocities. As regards the other Application, however, Sub-Commission had handed down a &quot; decision &quot; (for text see my immediately following telegram) effectof which is formally to ask Her Majesty&apos;s Government to give facilities for investigation on the spot, by the Sub-Commission or some members of it. Theterms of reference of this investigation as set out in their decision requireconsiderable clarification, but the principal points of enquiry are likely to be theextent to which an emergency still exists in Cyprus, and the circumstances in whichthe curfew regulations are applied.2. We shall naturally try to fend this off and will start with a letter to theCommission requesting clarification, but we are likely before long to be facedwith choice between admitting mission to Cyprus and refusing to afford facilities as required by Article 28 (a) of the Convention, which I judge Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be reluctant to contemplate except for most weighty reasons.3. I know how very strongly opposed you have been to accepting any suchmission. It would help us in advising Ministers concerned if we could have yourlatest considered appreciation of the risks or dangers which might arise fromadmitting a mission (which would consist of reputable international lawyersunlikely wittingly to stir up trouble). I realise and fully sympathise with theextreme inconvenience which such a visit would cause, but please feel free to spellthis out. The dangerous consequences of admission seem to fall under fourheads:  (i) Danger of bloodshed by either community;(ii) danger of non-violent demonstrations and breach of public order;(iii) damage to prestige internally;(iv) administrative difficulties arising from need to look after commission andmeet their requests for information.Point (iv) is one which we fully recognise but which may not unfortunatelyin itself weigh much at Strasbourg. Point (i) is of course of the greatest importance.4. I should be grateful for your assessment of the likelihood of such dangersand any others you may wish to suggest, as far as possible distinguishing betweenthe various heads above.From Cyprus23rd September, 1957No. 1470For Secretary of State from Harding.Your telegrams No. 1544 and No. 1545.   .European Human Rights Commission.This is a very.difficult question. I can see the disadvantage of rejecting theproposal that the sub-commission, or part of it, should visit Cyprus, but many realdangers and difficulties will be involved by agreeing to a visit. I have set out below
some of the more serious considerations involved, but before I can give a properlyconsidered reply to your questions I shall need more precise information on thefollowing points:  (a) What are likely to be the precise terms of reference of the visitingsub-commission ?(b) What would be its actual- composition?   Obviously I could not accept asub-commission that contained a Greek (or: Turkish) representative.(c) How, in precise terms, would the sub-commission propose to conduct itsinvestigations? What type of person would they propose to interview?Could the Cyprus Government and other interested parties berepresented by counsel at their hearings? Would witnesses be liableto cross-examination? In view of secrecy of proceedings, wouldwitnesses be seen privately and would findings be privileged? To what extent would the sub-commission expect to be given access toGovernment records and classified information?  And so on and so on.2. As you know, EOKA is a clandestine organisation which is obviously not going to reveal its strength and intention to members of any such sub-commission.Since there is no other source of information open to them, the sub-commission would thus be bound to rely on Government records to assess the magnitude ofthe threat to the life of the nation presented by the existence of EOKA. We havealready in our written pleadings and at oral hearings described the information which we interpret in light of past, experience as demonstrating this threat.Furthermore, threats from Athens Radio and EOKA and PEKA sources constitute an admission by the underground organisation of violent revolutionary intentions.We have learnt by bitter experience to take such threats seriously. Indeed, thewhole basis of the intimidation campaign has been ability of EOKA to carry out these threats: If the sub-commission proposed to take evidence from individualsthey would be faced with lying witnesses and stage-managed performances byprofessional petitioners. They would be quite unable to get at truth of situationand it would probably not be possible for us to produce counter-witnesses becauseappearance by GreekCypriot not sponsored by EOKA could not be kept secret and his life would, thereafter, be in grave danger. Moreover; the Turks would.; nodoubt, secure witnesses to add to the confusion. .3. I would expect Greek Cypriots to be on their best behaviour during sucha visit and there might well be deliberate restraint during the visit to limitintimidatory practices such as slogan writing, leafieteefing, violent sermons andthreatening letters. Indeed, attempts would no doubt be made by Greek Cypriotsto create an atmosphere of freedom of expression and calm for the occasion to demonstrate, as they would claim, moderate attitude of leaders of the community and their sincere desire.for peaceful settlement. On the other hand,. TurkishCypriots are most unlikely to allow such an occasion to pass without demonstration.They would make a considerable effort which could well lead to inter-communalclashes with serious consequences. Turkish Cypriots might go even further andresort to physical violence. Depending on internal situation here at the time, itmight be necessary to suggest certain restrictions on activities of sub-commission for their personal safety.  I trust they would understand this.4. As regards damage to prestige, there is no doubt we should suffer badly inthis respect with both communities, but for different reasons. However, this isnot decisive factor in considering this matter. My main concern is that visit would undoubtedly heighten political tension between communities and thus constitutedefinite threat to life and property which would necessitate special measure to contain.5. A visit of this kind would certainly impose a heavy additional burden notonly on the administration, but on the Security Forces as well. I agree that thisis not in itself a decisive consideration, but it does affect the timing of a visit if itwas decided to accept (corrupt group ? it) and the methods employed by thesub-commission to carry out their investigations.6. Finally, I. would be most strongly opposed to a visit by such asub-commission while the Cyprus question is open for discussion at.the current session of the United Nations General Assembly or while there remains any
prospect of making progress in discussion between the Powers principally concerned. Tension which visit might raise here would be reflected in Greece and turkey and could have serious repercussions on international plane.7. To sum up, there is a real danger that a visit under present conditions would lead to bloodshed. It would almost certainly be the cause of breaches ofpublic order. It could not fail to be damaging to our prestige internally and itwould impose a heavy additional burden on the administration and the security forces. If it were admitted and did lead to bloodshed, or even to seriouslyheightened tension between the two main communities, it would set at nought fora longish period all the efforts we have made and are making to narrow the gap between them and between their respective backers, Greece and Turkey.8. My recommendation is that we should not reject the proposal, but that weshould use every argument and device open to us to play for time. In any case,I should require precise answers to the questions I have posed in paragraph 1 above and others before I could agree to accept the proposed visit.From Cyprus1st October, 1957No. 1508.My telegram No. 1470. &apos;Council of Europe Human Rights Commission.I have been giving further consideration with my advisers to situation in whichwe find ourselves in relation to our obligations under European Convention.From the start of these proceedings nearly eighteen months ago we have indulgedthe Commission and sub-commissions with our fullest co-operation. A vastamount of effort has been diverted, here and in London, to the preparation ofmaterial to the detriment of other and more constructive purposes, and nothinghas been spared to meet requirements of these enquiries. There must surely bea limit to extent to which a signatory Power can be expected to allow itself to be subjected to such unscrupulous attacks, even by an ally. The Greek Governmenthave, as must be evident to sub-commission from recent exchanges, exploitedthese proceedings to the full from political motives. Furthermore, whenever thecourse of these deliberations appears to have taken a favourable turn from theGreek point of view (e.g., after 2nd/3rd July proceedings and when sub-commissiondecided upon visiting mission) suitable publicity has been arranged in contravention of Article 33. This was not the case at the conclusion of the last hearings whenthe fate of application 299 was not a matter for enthusiasm on part of Greekpoliticians. The circumstances of whole exercise could not have been envisagedwhen Her Majesty&apos;s Government committed themselves to this convention.However much sub-commission may attempt to isolate itself from political aspectsof this matter in its own deliberations it has not done anything effective to curbthe Greek abuse of the proceedings and since the whole approach of the Greeksis so plainly political it is not difficult to see what political use that Governmentwould make of visiting mission. In my view the United Kingdom Governmenthas every right to expect sub-commission to protect it from political machinationsof hostile Government engaged in the active support of sedition and subversionin a British territory. As I have often remarked, if the Greek Government isgenuinely interested in restoration of &quot; freedoms &quot; to people of this island whydoes it not co-operate with us in calling for the renunciation of violence andintimidation as political weapons? Simply because this is not their aim and that much at least should by now have been absolutely clear to the members of thesub-commission.2. Seen from our position in the Middle East, situation is one in which britain, as sovereign Power, having been confronted with armed conspiracypromoted largely by the Greek Government; is now being called to account bythe sub-commission at the instigation of the guilty party for measures it has takento deal with subversion in Cyprus. This in itself is extremely damaging to our prestige and authority and I fear that to acquiesce either in visiting mission,which has been major aim of Greek policy in wider political context, or in view
of Greece&apos;s conduct of this unscrupulous campaign of denigration in a detailed investigation, either in Strasbourg or in Cyprus, into their wild allegations ofatrocities would be regarded in this area, and particularly in Cyprus itself, asfurther evidence of weakening authority and thus encourage our opponents tofurther excesses.3. The political smearing of this Government and of the Security forces that could be achieved by Greece if she were allowed to continue to misuse thesub-commission for this purpose might well in the long run be more damaging to our interests than our refusal to allow ourselves to be pilloried any longer in this forum.4. Our complaints against the Greek Government for the sinister part it has played in provoking measures complained of in these proceedings are using theproceedings as means of diverting our strength from EOKA and as part of its political propaganda; and against sub-commission for lending itself meekly tothese procedures and failing to take any action so far in regard to the persistentbreaches of the security of the proceedings are so serious that to reject visitingmission would not seem sufficiently to demonstrate gravity of matter from our point of view. Her Majesty&apos;s Government could presumably never have consideredthat it would be manoeuvred into this position under the convention by aGovernment deliberately aiming at upsetting our position in one of our dependent territories. Proceedings have demonstrated amply how an aggressor nation can,with co-operation of sub-commission, succeed in harrassing its victim in attemptto gain further advantage in its aggressive activities. I would like to have saidwith &quot; innocent co-operation &quot; of sub-commission but in light of information which has been forcefully and exhaustively put before them, attitude at hearingsof Greek representatives and its own response to the obvious abuses practisedby Greeks, I am afraid our complaint lies against that body also. Thus I believethat simply to reject visiting mission would by no means meet the circumstances.The danger to which it seems to me Her Majesty&apos;s Government are exposed bythe way this Convention has worked in practice in this case demands a reappraisalof our position. I could of course elaborate on this intolerable situation, but I am sure you will appreciate my feelings in this matter; in any case, effects of theproceedings were fully dealt with in my Savingram No. 1482 of 30th July, 1957,and my telegram No. 1491 and my telegram under reference.5. From these arguments you will see that I feel strongly that in the lightof what has already taken place before the sub-commission and in the light of theinternal security situation here we should take a robust stand against exposingourselves any further to unscrupulous attacks before a body which has shown nocapacity or will to control the excesses of the Greeks. In order, to bring this process to a halt you might feel that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be justifiedin taking the matter to highest level of the Council of Europe with intimation that, unless effective action is taken to protect us from these malicious proceedings,we shall have seriously to reconsider our position under the convention. Inmeantime, the sub-commission would have to be informed that we regarded theproceedings as suspended for the time being. Timing of such an approach would of course be matter for consideration in London but it seems to me that if thiscourse is to be followed it should not be long delayed.6. I realise that the course I have suggested above has implications well beyond the Cyprus issue and I appreciate the seriousness with which Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would regard such action. But after considerable reflection, andwith respect, it seems to me that we have allowed ourselves to be taken far enough.To Cyprus10th October, 1957No. 1693Your telegram No. 1508.Council of Europe Human Rights Commission.Personal from the Minister of State.Secretary of State was most grateful for frank expression of your views andwe discussed it together before he left for East Africa/ I have also had foreign secretary&apos;s reaction.
2. We all share your strong feelings that it is time, if only there were means,for a halt to be called. But it is the means which trouble us, as well as the repercussions elsewhere of our saying thus far and no farther.3. Your proposal that we should try to go over the heads of the Sub-Commission to the Committee of Ministers is attractive. Only in that forum could we elaborate the political aspects of the case and hope to get some unstanding of political realities as distinct from the legalities with which the Sub-commission is occupied. But there are two difficulties in this.(a) We can by no means necessarily count on a majority of the Committeetaking our view, especially if we come to them having frustrated theSub-Commission in what the Convention permits it to do, and are thusconfessedly in breach of the Convention. It might well turn out tobe more damaging to us in the long run if we are in breach on thisprocedural question of admitting the investigation than on the substance of Application 176. In the one case we should be flouting obligations which we had freely accepted (and in fact had a part in drafting). Inthe other we should be found at fault in circumstances in which, on a review by the Council of Ministers, we could hope to be exonerated.(b) There is no means within the Convention of our going direct to theMinisters.4. While we never conceived the Convention being used against us like this,we are in fact caught between a binding treaty obligation and letting the investigation proceed. We shall have to come to a decision one way or the othervery soon, and it is to help us reach this decision that I am now seeking your furtherviews.5. It may help you to have such answers as we can provide to the questions in your telegram No. 1470. Some of this adds to our concern about the dangerof such a visit providing the spark to new disorders. It would be most helpful tohave your more detailed assessment of this possibility, in the light of this telegram.6. You will see from correspondence enclosed with our savingram No. 1607that we have already asked the Sub-Commission for clarification of what it intends to investigate. A reply should follow the Sub-Commission&apos;s meeting on 9th October. Meanwhile, it is probably fair to assume that we shall be able tosecure terms of reference which lay down precisely just what the visitors are to do.7. Your questions (b) and (c) in your telegram No. 1470 are ones which wedo not think we could raise with the Sub-Commission without implying that wewere in principle willing to permit the investigation to take place, and we can therefore only give you our own comments on them. We recognise the fundamental importance of point (b) and it extends not only to the members of the visitingteam but also to Modinos, the Council of Europe&apos;s Director of Human Rights. Wethink we might be able, if it came to the point, to have Modinos excluded, although we would also have to have excluded McNulty, whose presence might well be favourable to us. The case of the Greek member of the Sub-Commission is more complicated. If we got him out we shall obviously also have to give up Waldock,the British member, who, besides being the only member with experience of asimilar investigation (in Trieste) is the only member familiar with English law andthe only one likely to handle at all aggressively the kind of witness we can expect the Greeks to have put up. Since we doubt whether the Sub-Commission willadmit counsel, Waldock&apos;s presence has a considerable value as the only potentiallyeffective cross-examiner in the team and it could be worth keeping him even if theprice were to accept the Greek as well.8. On your (c), we think it unlikely that the Sub-Commission would allow&quot; interested parties &quot; to be represented by Counsel. So the only cross-examinationwould be from the Sub-Commission itself. We think the proceedings wouldcertainly be secret and evidence privileged, although the Sub-Commission would no doubt advert to evidence given before it if its findings were finally made public.We would obviously impress on the Sub-Commission so far as we could the undesirability of allowing it to be known or feared that such references might bemade. We think the Sub-Commission would be reasonable on access toGovernment records and classified information.
9. There is one further thing which you will no doubt weigh carefully. the connection  between this and the &quot; atrocities &quot; application is obvious and thepossibility of the Sub-Commission desiring to investigate that application on the spot certainly arises. There is also perhaps a danger that once the team got to cyprus efforts would be made to add the other investigation, to its terms ofreference.10. We can possibly stall a little longer with Sub-Commission but UnitedKingdom Agent must soon be pressed to say whether or not Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment are prepared to co-operate with Sub-Commission in carrying out their decision to make an investigation on the spot. I should therefore be most grateful to have your further advice soon, so that whole- matter can be put to colleagues in near future.From Cyprus12 th October, 1957No. 1553Your telegram No. 1693.Council of Europe Human Rights Commission.Personal for Lord Perth from Harding.Begins.I was glad to know that you were able to discuss this crucial matter withSecretary of State before his departure for East Africa and to hear that my feelingson this matter are shared by Foreign Secretary as well as you and Secretary of State.I am by no means convinced of inevitability of our being obliged to accept VisitingMission; moreover, there appears to be some misunderstanding between us onnature of my suggestion that we should now confront Committee of Ministers withintolerable situation to which Greek intrigue, combined with Sub-Commission&apos;sweakness and our co-operative attitude, have brought us.2. It was not my intention that we should go to Committee of Ministershaving &quot; frustrated Sub-Commission &quot; or &quot; flouted our obligations.&quot; What I have proposed is that Sub-Commission should be informed that we regarded proceedingsas suspended as we intended to take up with Committee of Ministers question ofmanner in which this case has been manipulated by Greeks in flagrant disregard of spirit of Convention. There need be no question of rejecting Sub-Commission&apos;request at this stage. It seems to me that most we could be accused of would be amild measure of discourtesy to Sub-Commission or lack of co-operation trivialmatters in context of this squalid episode with its grave repercussions.3. As you have recognised, Committee of Ministers is only forum in whichwe could hope to expose Greek political motives for which Convention is beingabused. Fear that we could not count on sustaining our case before that body doesnot seem to me to be a vital factor. Strength of our case is such that, as seen fromhere, it seems clear that we either have a good chance of success or strongest groundsthereafter for refusing to have any further truck with such an intolerable exercise.With respect, I suggest that this is clearly a case in which we should not take counselof our fears.4. As regards your paragraph 3 (b), I would point out with respect that itwas because we recognised that Convention did not provide adequate means ofredress or protection for party treated as we have been, that I suggested an approach on political plane. As party to Convention we have interest in seeing that it is not abused. If Convention itself does not facilitate this, only course open to us would appear to be intervention with political organisation whichsponsored the Convention and which therefore has primary duty to safeguard itsintegrity.5. I do not propose to comment in detail on your paragraphs 7-8 at this stagealthough I agree generally with what you say. As regards paragraph 9, I washorrified to read that an attempt by Sub-Commission to widen scope of suggestedenquiry to embrace application No. 299 could even be contemplated. If thatreally is the case, it is in my opinion sufficient reason in itself for refusing a visit.
6. The point raised in paragraph 5 of your telegram under reference wasdealt with in my telegram No. 1470. Since then, further substantial evidence hascome to hand regarding EOKA preparations and plans which are covered in thepaper enclosed with Neale&apos;s letter to Higham of 8th September and my reports on operation &quot; JACKPOT &quot; and the Ashiotis incident. These reinforce what Ihave already said on the dangers of disorder especially in so far as both reveal tosome extent EOKA&apos;s own assessment of Turkish intentions and the scale of counter-action needed to meet this threat. The only other major point I have to add is the probable reactions of the Turkish Government and the Turkish-cypriot community to our acceptance of a visit. I would not put it past them to engineerdisturbances in their own interests in fact I consider such action on their partmore than likely. I would have thought that the Turks would regard such a visitas a weak and disastrous retreat by us in the face of a Greek political attack from(? on intended) the proper exercise of our authority in the Island. The GreekCypriots would certainly regard it in this light. Further consideration of the point is have mentioned in this paragraph has more than ever convinced me that undercurrent conditions a visit would be the cause of breaches of public order and thatthere is a real danger that it would lead to bloodshed.Ends.From Cyprus26th October, 1957No. 1652My telegrams No. 1508 and No. 1553.Following for Lord Perth.Strasbourg.I was glad to see from your telegrams No. 1798 and No. 1864 that you hopequestion of Visiting Mission will be considered next week.I very much hope that firm decision can be taken quickly. The matters inquestion are intimately concerned with my administration and I feel very strongly that my successor should not be embarrassed by having to put up with such anunwarrantable interference in the internal administration of the island as a review by an outside and hopelessly biased body of my conduct of the internal securitycampaign would represent. I trust, therefore, that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill be adamant in refusing to countenance such an invasion of our authority here.
