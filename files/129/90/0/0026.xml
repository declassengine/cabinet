y(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRTAMIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT,-C, (57) 276 COPY NG.20th November, 1957CABINETCYPRUSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs summarise for the information of my colleagues the action that hasbeen taken in the diplomatic field to further a solution of the cyprus problem (C. (57) 178 and C.C.(57) 59th Conclusions, Minute 2 refer).2.     After prior consultation with the United States Government andM. Spaak, the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(N.A.T.O.), our suggestion far an international conference was putinformally to the Greek and Turkish Governments.     The United StatesGovernment and M. Spaak each informed the Greek and Turkish Govern-ments of their general support, though the United States Government wereinitially hesitant about attending such a conference themselves.     TheTurkish Government accepted our proposal, but made it plain that theywould find it exceedingly difficult to attend a conference before their ownelections on 27th Cctober.    After some prevarication, the Greek Govern-ment said they could attend a conference only if agreement on the substance of the Cyprus question had been reached beforehand.     It was also clearthat they were in any case unwilling to make any move until after theUnited Nations debate.3.     As no progress was possible for the time being with either the greeks or the Turks, secret, exploratory and informal talks were heldfirst with the United States Government and subsequently with M. Spaak.Talks with the Americans4.      We reviewed all possible scluti&amp;ns in very frank discussion with theUnited States Government, and at one time it looked as if they would come out in favour of tripartite condominium.     However, on second thoughtsthey decided in favour of exploratory talks by M. Spaak with the Greek and turkish Governments on all possible solutions, with no expressedpreference for any one.Talks with M. Spaak5.     Like the Americans, M. Spaak accepted our view that any solutionmust fulfil the following conditions:-(a) Ker Majesty&apos;r. Government should retain their minimumessential military facilities under British sovereignty;(b) the island should be protected from Communist infiltra-tion;-1-SECRET
SECRET135(c) peace and tranquillity in the island should be ensured;(d) the solution should be acceptable to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Greek and Turkish Govern-m ent s.M. Spaak has a strong preference for guaranteed independence.     Hisideas are summarised in the attached note.     During my recent discussionwith him in London he recognised that any proposed solution must havean element of attrp.ction for the Turks.     I told him that his ideascontained difficult points for ourselves.     I said, however, that any schemewhich was acceptable to both the Greek and Turkish Governments would beconsidered most sympathetically by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.M. Spaak suggested that the settlement might include provision forN.A.T.O. bases entrusted to Turkey.6.      After consultation with the Prime Minister and the Minister ofState forColonia.1 Affairs, I informed M. Spaak, who was3s!xortly to seethe Greek Foreign Minister, that if he could tell us that his ideas, includingrecognition of the substantial Turkish interest in the future of the island,commended themselves to the Greek Government, we would certainly beready to regard them as one of the solutions to be discussed among othersat any meeting that Her Majesty&apos;s Government or M. Spaak in his personal capacity might be able to arrange.7.      We have now had from M. Spaak an account of his conversationwith the Greek Foreign Minister.    The latter was &quot;negative&quot; about theidea of a Turkish base.    Nothing new or concrete has emerged from thisexchange to justify hopes of narrowing the gap betv/een the Greek and turkish positions.8.      In order to keep matters in play with the Greek Government,H. M. Ambassador at Athens had tcld the Greek Foreign Minister on instructions on 25th October that we would be prepared to give the mostsympathetic consideration to any proposal which commended itself to both the Greek e.nd Turkish Governments.    That being so we should be interested to know whether he had put to the Turks the ideas which heoutlined to me in New York and, if not, whether he proposed to do so.These ideas were-(a) that Cyprus should have Dominion status subject to thecondition that she could not change that status fora maximum period of 20 years;(b) that Cyprus should have Dominion status provided thatafter 12 years the question of changing that statusshould be put to the United Nations;(c) that there should be self-government on lines agreeable to the Greeks for ten years, after which there wouldbe a plebiscite.So far as we know, these ideas have still not been put. to the Turks by the greeks,
SECRET1369.      To sum up, we have quite a good record of activity - the prolongedbut unsuccessful soundings for a conference, the talks with the Americans,the talks with M. Spaak, the talks with the Greeks, M. Spaak!s talks withthe Greeks - and now we are ais-a to have talks with the Turks.    Some ofthese efforts can be quoted effectively in the case which we can lay before the United Nations.S.L.Foreign Office, S. W.l.19th November, 1957.SUMMARY OF M. SPAAK&apos;S proposals . To give the island independence and make it a member of theBritish Commonwealth.    Is this possible?    What would be the reactions of the interested parties?    It seems that the Greeks and Cypriots would accept it in principle.     The British doubtless would do so also.     Itseems that the Turks would not oppose this solution, on condition that itcould not be considered as a first stage towards the attachment of the island to Greece.    How can this fear be dispelled?    There would have tobe an international conference at which the three Governments principallyinterested would be represented, together with the Americans and perhapsone or the other country (sic), which would take a decision in principle.The agreement to be reached should also include arrangements that, if in the future the Cypriots were to leave the Commonwealth, therewould be a new international conference, with similar representation,which should decide their new status.The new international entity created by the independence of cyprus could become a member of N. A.T.O.    This would enable an agree-ment to be reached on the bases, whether they are to be British or inter-national.II. Could one not seek the solution in another way, that formulated bythe French and the Germans to regulate the Saar question (Agreement of23rd October, 1954) ?    It would be a matter of giving independence to the island but also of nominating for it - in the Council of N.A.T.O,, forexample - a High Commissioner whose task would be to ensure observance of the internal status of the island as well as its international status.Each status would be fixed by an international conference.The arrangements of the Agreement of 23rd October, 1954, which one could take as a model would naturally be adapted to the particularsituation of Cyprus.As it seems probable that the conference proposed by the Britishcannot take place, and as it seems necessary in the meantime to find asolution without further delay, it could perhaps be put to the NoAcT.O.-3-SECRET
SECRET137countries- apart from the three principally concerned, to recommend the holding of a conference to which would be submitted two proposals;  theone revolving on the independence of Cyprus within the Commonwealth;the other revolving on independence with a High Commissioner nominated by the Council of N.A.T ,Q.An initiative of this sort could not be taken if in the meantime theagreement in principle of the three Governments principally concerned were not assured in advance.4-
