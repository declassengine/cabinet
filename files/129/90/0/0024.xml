Copy No. 5 4C. (57) 27422nd November, 1957CABINETTHE SEVERN BRIDGE AND THE ROADS programme memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Minister for Welsh Affairs, in his paper on the Severn Bridge (C. (57) 273)supports the proposal originally put to me by the Minister of Transport, that a start should be made on the Severn Bridge in the financial year 1960-61 and thatthe decision should be announced now. The suggestion is that room can be found for it within the total expenditure approved for the roads programme. Therecan in my judgment be no question of such an announcement in existingcircumstances.2. The agreed roads programme for England and Wales provides for expenditure on new construction and major improvements rising to a total of annual payments from the Exchequer exceeding  60 millions. The figure Ioriginally put forward in discussion was  50 millions, and this was increased to 60 millions on the urgent plea, as I understood it, that anything smaller would not enable us to deal with the difficulties arising from increasing congestion on theexisting roads with the growth of traffic. Indeed I specifically asked the Ministerof Transport to assure me that this higher figure, which was by no means easy to accept, did not provide for such a project as the Severn Bridge. It is thereforewith surprise that I hear it argued that room can be found within this programme for the addition of this project.3. The Severn Bridge is an expensive project. With its immediate approachesit will cost  15-^ millions. To link it with the Midlands (in the region of the RossSpur) would cost a further  11^ millions. To link it with Chippenham (and london) would cost  6 millions. This makes a total of  33 millions, quite apartfrom any further works which it may make necessary to allow for the increasedtraffic flow to London.4. If it be argued that the links with Chippenham and with the Midlandscan wait for some years until after the Bridge is completed, so that its cost can bekept down to  15^ millions, I am bound to ask if the Bridge is of only localimportance. It seems to me that we cannot make such a major addition to theroad system of the country without catering for the resulting traffic properly,and that in fact we are faced with a totalexpenditure which, making some provisionfor a possible rise in costs, may not be less than  40 millions and could in certaincircumstances be substantially more.5. Nor can I accept that Wales is being unfairly treated. In 1953 the LloydCommittee recommended the Ross Spur and the Heads of the Valleys Road(linking with the Midlands) as giving quicker relief to South Wales than the muchmore expensive Severn Bridge, which would mainly improve communications with london. Physical work on the Ross Spur may start this year, and the cost of thisalone is expected to be  7^ millions The Heads of the Valleys Road will cost over  6^ millions, and will start next year. As regards the political aspect, oneend of the Severn Bridge would be in my constituency.  I have already publicly52631Printed for the Cabinet. November 1957
defended its absence from any programme on the basis of the arguments outlined above, and there is no difficulty whatever in holding this further. Indeed to reverse would be very hard to explain.6. I am accordingly convinced that it is premature to consider any decisionnow about starting the Severn Bridge in three years&apos; time. I am even moreconvinced that it would be folly to announce such a project in the present economic climate.7. Indeed, I must go further and ask whether the provision which we have madein the roads programme is not over-generous, and whether we ought not to consider some reduction. When I consider the limits which have had to be imposed inother fields it does appear open to doubt whether provision which appears nowto be far more generous than I had supposed can be justified for the roads programme. I would however propose to defer a decision on this till we settle the investment programme for 1960-61 in the spring of next year. In the meantimeannouncements of specific projects for 1960-61 and later should not be announced by some Departments to the prejudice of others.P. T.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,21st November, 1957.
