(57) 59th Conclusions, Minute 2), the Cabinet instructedme to arrange for officials of the Treasury, Colonial Office and Board of Trade toexamine the problems of economic and commercial policy which would arise underthe proposed condominium in Cyprus and to submit a further report on these aspects of the proposal.The attached report by officials has been prepared for this purpose.(Signed)        NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th November, 1957.
ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF CYPRUS CONDOMINIUMNote by officials the Cabinet on 30th July referred to the economic problems which wouldhave to be considered in the event of a condominium being established in Cyprus.We have examined these problems and our conclusions are in the attached report.A summary of our main conclusions is as follows.I. Arrangements for Handling Commercial Questions(a) Rights and Obligations of Cyprus under Existing TreatiesThe arrangements between the co-domini should provide for the assumptionby the condominium of treaty rights and obligations previously assumed by her majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom on behalf of Cyprus, and any subsequent decisions with a view to revising commercial treaties should requirethe consent of all three co-domini (paragraph 3).(b) Representation of Cypriot Interests in International Commercial discussions the most practical arrangement would be for one of the co-domini to becharged with this by the other two co-domini; the alternative would be for all three co-domini to act jointly, possibly through chosen Cypriot delegates(paragraph 4).(c) Imperial PreferenceThere is nothing in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.)which would prevent the continuation of the present Imperial Preference granted by and to Cyprus. The decision whether the United Kingdom or other countries would continue to give preferences to Cyprus might depend most on whether theycontinued to enjoy preference in Cyprus (paragraph 6).II. Provision of Financial and Technical Assistance to Cyprus(a) Under a condominium there should be no question of a permanentcontribution to the Cyprus Ordinary Budget from United Kingdom sources as envisaged in the Radcliffe report. If any temporary assistance were required theamount should be shared by the co-domini (paragraph 7).(b) Development FinanceAny United Kingdom financial commitment to assist the development programme of Cyprus should be reduced to the minimum. But this should notrule out in principle the making available to Cyprus of assistance already promisedunder the current Colonial Development and Welfare Act, i.e., up to 1960. Itwould, however, seem preferable that this should not continue to be provided under Colonial Development and Welfare machinery. The eligibility of Cyprusfor Colonial Development Corporation assistance would need to be reviewed(paragraph 8).(c) Technical AidThere would be no objection in principle to Cyprus continuing to receivetechnical assistance from the United Kingdom (paragraph 10).III. Relationship with the Sterling AreaThere are three theoretical possibilities:  (i) to carry on as at present, i.e., for Cyprus to remain within the sterling area and to maintain exchange control restrictions against all countriesTOP SECRET52608 b
outside the sterling area (although there might be certain administrativerelaxations in favour of Greece and Turkey, e.g., an increase in the travel allowances);(ii) to adopt an arrangement on the lines of the present Hong Kong system,i.e., Cyprus would not impose any exchange restrictions against greece and Turkey but would apply the normal restrictions to transactions with the rest of the non-sterling world;(hi) to exclude Cyprus from the sterling area, i.e., the United Kingdom would maintain an exchange barrier against Cyprus (possibly making certain administrative relaxations) and Cyprus would make whateverarrangements she considered appropriate with Greece and Turkey.On general grounds, course (i) would be the most satisfactory both for theUnited Kingdom and for Cyprus, even if it involved allowing Cyprus to make certain relaxations in favour of Greece and Turkey; this is the course to aim atin negotiations but it may not be- acceptable to Greece and Turkey. Course (ii)could not be accepted by the United Kingdom because it would risk thedevelopment of a new gap in the sterling area&apos;s defences in the Middle East. Thespecial consideration in the case of Hong Kong,,/.e., ability to maintain a traditionalentrepot trade, has no parallel in Cyprus&apos; case. Course (iii) is therefore the only alternative if Greece and Turkey will not accept (i). For the United Kingdom,course (iii) would not entail any direct economic disadvantage. For Cyprus,however, the full range of economic consequences of exclusion from the sterling area would be harmful. It would involve the restriction of outward investmentfrom the United Kingdom, the blocking of sterling securities held by Cyprusresidents; no access to the sterling area gold and-dollar reserves, or to the london market for new money. Although these economic consequences could be mitigatedto some extent by giving Cyprus preferential exchange control treatment (as atpresent for the Sudan), the general effect might still be undesirable both 011 the-economy of Cyprus,and- on- sterling area cohesion. There might also be certainpolitical disadvantages in excluding Cyprus from the sterling area. For example,it might be taken as an: indication that the United Kingdom was trying to-abdicate&apos;future responsibility; for- the, island. On the -whole, therefore,- course; (iii) would-be a poor second best to course (i) (paragraphs 11-15).IV. External Loans, Currency and Banking(a) London Market LoansEven if Cyprus remained within the sterling area it is unlikely that she wouldbe able to raise any loans on the London Market in the foreseeable1 future.  But-&apos;-an immediate problem would have to be faced, namely that of securing that the-rights of the holders of existing- Cyprus-loam stock issued -inUondon&apos; were&quot;-fully&quot;protected.   (This issue has in fact already been confidentially guaranteed by her Majesty&apos;s Government in certain circumstances.)   This-might-be ^ done- by&quot;?seeking to retain-, powers analogous to those-of-disallowance, or by obtainingundertakings  analogous, to  those  entered  into  by certain  Commonwealth-Governments  concerning-;, legislation  which  might  prejudice- the - rights   ofstockholders (paragraph-16).,(b) CurrencyThe most -sensible course would be for Cyprus* to retain -her own separate&apos;currency as at present, even if she had to leave the sterling area. Any Bill; affecting;the currency of Cyprus should require the consent of the three co-domini.   Itseems unlikely that Greece or Turkey would press for their currencies to become ^legal tender in Cyprus, but. if they did the proposal should be resisted.   It seemsmore likely that they would..press, for part of-the,currency -backing &apos;Xo be&quot; invested in Greece and Turkey.  This would be wrong in principle&apos; if the&quot;Cyprus&apos;poundretained its link with sterling (paragraph 17).(c) BankingThe establishment of condomirri^M&quot;i-WouMasiOt-;iO&quot;f-?itss4fi&quot;Scausei complicationsin the field of banking-,,but jt-wouldbe. desirable to^ensure that Bills, regulating thebusiness vof- banking, shqukL* require:. the; consent of the three JcoJ-domini(paragraph 18).
ANNEXCYPRUS:  ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL QUESTIONS UNDERCONDOMINIUMAssumptionThere has been general agreement in Cabinet that if genuine goodwillbetween the three co-domini could be assumed and the co-operation of the local inhabitants assured, a reasonable basis of negotiation might include the following arrangements:  (a) the Governor^ powers defined, as regards the internal administration of the island, by the Radcliffe constitution, amended as necessary;(b) all decisions relating to external affairs would have to command the assent of each of the co-domini. Failing such assent the status quo would bemaintained.The following paragraphs are based on the assumption that such arrangements would be made.Proposed Arrangements in Radcliffe Constitution2. The arrangements envisaged in the Radcliffe constitution provided for aMinistry, of Development, a Ministry for Natural Resources (including mines), anda Ministry of Finance, embracing Budget, Estimates, Inland Revenue, Treasury,Audit, under Financial Affairs, and Economic Policy, Banking, Customs,Commerce, &amp;c, under Economic Affairs. Importation of goods and relations withother States, the United Nations and its agencies were enumerated in the Radcliffereport ampng &quot;matters which in some cases it will always and in other cases it maysometimes be necessary to treat as included within the range of Governor^ mattersby virtue of the fact that they involve external affairs, defence or internal security.&quot;The Governor would be empowered tp make Ordinances in respect of such matters.The Governor would withhold assent to a Bill passed by the Legislative Assemblyif lie were of opinion that it dealt either in whole or in part with any matter thatwas one of the Governors matters. The Governor would not, without havingpreviously obtained Her Majesty&apos;s instructions through a Secretary of State, signifyassent to any Bill which in his opinion fell within the following classes:  (i) a Bill affecting the currency of Cyprus or its coinage or affecting foreign exchange or its control;(ii) a Bill affecting the Trustee Status of any Cyprus Government Stock;any such Bill after enactment would be capable of being disallowed by Her Majesty.I.-Possible Arrangements for Handling Commercial QuestionsRights and Obligations under Existing Treaties3. The arrangements between the co-domini should provide for the assumptionby the condominium of treaty rights and obligations previously assumed by HerMajes.ty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom for or in respect of Cyprus. Alldecisions with a view to revising commercial treaties should be treated on the same basis as other external affairs. It would, be open to the self-governing side of theAdministration to propose revisions, but any such proposal would have to command the assent of each of the co-domini to effect any change.International, Commercial Discussions..   4,   Tfhe repres,enta^pi)i of the interests qf.

review the putting into force of the European Economic Community. The following are the alternative possible arrangements:  (i) One of the co-domini alone to be charged with this.   This might be themost convenient arrangement and in the Cypriots&apos; own interests it mightbe best if this responsibility were assigned to the United Kingdom.(ii) All three co-domini to act jointly on behalf of Cyprus.  As a permanentarrangement this might be administratively clumsy (though the secretariat of the proposed Three-Power Council might be able toundertake it). The interests of Cyprus might be sacrificed since theircrops compete with those of Greece and Turkey in overseas markets.The choice between the two alternatives is principally a political one; either couldbe accepted if it attracted greater support from Greece and Turkey and Cypriotrepresentatives.In practice the Cyprus authorities could, if the co-domini agreed, be allowedto select delegates to represent the condominium at international conferences; but,since the co-domini would bear the responsibility for any commitments accepted onbehalf of Cyprus, they would have to reserve the right to reject any particularselection (and to make their own selection if necessary).Strategic Exports5. Maintenance of existing controls of strategic exports would be important,but it should be possible to secure this by reserving adequate powers to the governor and co-domini as in paragraph 1 (a) and (b) above.Imperial Preference6. The continuation of the present Imperial Preference granted by, and to,Cyprus would not be vulnerable in G.A.T.T. in the event of condominium. Cypruswould doubtless wish to maintain its present protection in the United kingdom market since this is its main market for agricultural produce. Precedents are mixedfor having Commonwealth preference arrangements with condominia and territories which have left the Commonwealth. There have never been any preferencearrangements with the New Hebrides or the Sudan condominia; on the other hand,when the Irish Republic and Burma left the Commonwealth, preferencearrangements with the former were maintained, and the grant of preference to thelatter was continued. The decision whether the United Kingdom or other countries would continue to give preference to Cyprus might depend most on whether theycontinued to enjoy preference in Cyprus. The extension of preferential treatmentby Cyprus to Greece and Turkey (other perhaps than through the association of cyprus with the European Free Trade Area) would require a waiver under theno-new preference rule of G.A.T.T.II. Financial and Technical Assistance to Cyprus7. The Radcliffe report envisaged that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would makea substantial annual contribution towards the cost of the Cyprus Police Force andPrison Service, and that the United Kingdom would bear the cost of inter-communaleducation.These arrangements would be inappropriate in the changed circumstances andthere should be no question of a permanent contribution to the Cyprus OrdinaryBudget from United Kingdom sources. Cyprus&apos; financial position should be examined with a view to ensuring that, from the start of the condominium or at most within a short period, ordinary expenditure and local revenue should be in balance. If it emerged that there was a real financial need for any temporaryassistance, the amount should be shared between the co-domini.Development Finance8. It would also be necessary to review the development programme of cyprus in the changed circumstances with a view to limiting to the minimum anyUnited Kingdom financial commitment. We should not rule out in principle themaking available to Cyprus of the balance of financial assistance already promised to her under the current Colonial Development and Welfare Act (/.e.,.up to March
I960) though the precise method by which this assistance should be made availablewould require consideration. Since one of the main objects of the establishmentof the condominium would be to give Cyprus a special status different from thatof a Colony, it would scarcely seem appropriate or politically desirable to provide,such assistance to Cyprus through the Colonial Development and Welfare Actwhich is designed for United Kingdom dependent territories (although it has been extended to the Anglo-French Condominium of the New Hebrides). Some other more suitable method would therefore need to be devised.Cyprus is at present eligible for assistance from the Colonial development corporation (C.D.C.), although the Corporation has not so far made anyinvestment in Cyprus. The activities of the C.D.C. are governed by the Overseas.Resources Development Acts, 1948-56. As they stand at present, no legislative action would be needed in order to preserve the eligibility of Cyprus for assistancefrom the C.D.C. under a condominium arrangement. It is however the intentionto amend the Acts so as to provide that the C.D.C. shall not be able to undertakenew projects in territories which become independent. If it were desired to preserve the eligibility of Cyprus under a condominium for assistance from the C.D.C., itwould be necessary to ensure that the amending legislation did not preclude this.For the reasons given above, however, it would scarcely seem appropriate thatthe C.D.C., which was set up to assist in the economic development of the UnitedKingdom dependent territories, should be permitted to invest in Cyprus under a condominium arrangement-nor is it likely that the Corporation would be interested in doing so.Budget Control9. As envisaged in the Radcliffe report, budget control would have to remainin local, control but it would be important that the Governor should be capable;of maintaining a sound financial system. It would not be desirable to provide,for approval of the budget by the co-domini. If at any time a situation devolped in which Cyprus had to be given a grant-in-aid of administration it would thenbe necessary to devise some form of financial control.Technical Aid10. At present Cyprus has access to the various advisory services and other forms of technical assistance provided by the Colonial Office. There is no reason why she should not continue to benefit from these services under a condominium-subject to suitable financial arrangements being made in cases where such services are provided under Colonial Development and Welfare schemes.HI-Relationship with the Sterling Area11. Before examining the problems that would arise in the fields of currency,banking and external payments, it is necessary to consider how a condominiumwould affect the relationship of Cyprus with the sterling area. There would seemto be three theoretical possibilities:  (1) To carry on as at present; i.e., for Cyprus to remain within the sterling area and to apply exchange restrictions on the existing basis to allother countries outside the sterling area but perhaps making certainrelaxations in favour of Greece and Turkey, e.g., an increase in the travel allowance.(2) To adopt an arrangement on the lines of the present Hong Kong system;i.e., Cyprus would not apply exchange control to Greece and Turkeybut would apply exchange control and import licensing arrangements to the rest of the non-sterling world.(3) To exclude Cyprus from,the sterling area; i.e., for the United kingdom to put Cyprus into the transferable account area and to impose theusual exchange restrictions though they could be administeredpreferentially, as for the Sudan; Cyprus would be left to makeappropriate arrangements with Greece and Turkey.These possibilities are discussed below.52608
12. Full Membership of Sterling Area. With the first alternative therewould, as at present, be no exchange restrictions on current or capital transactionsbetween the United Kingdom and Cyprus, and Cyprus would retain all the benefits of membership of the sterling area; in particular, access to the central reserves ofgold and dollars to finance her normal deficit with the dollar area, the advantageof a currency and banking system based on sterling, unrestricted flow of private capital from the United Kingdom, access to the London market for the investment of her reserves and for the raising of new money though the last would probablybe only a hypothetical benefit for some years.On general grounds a continuance of the present system would be the most satisfactory both for the United Kingdom and for Cyprus herself. However, asco-domini Greece and Turkey might well object because the Cyprus government at present restricts transfers to Greece and Turkey in connection with travel,education, emigration and investment in the same way as it restricts these transactions with other non-sterling countries.The United Kingdom could try to overcome these objections in the followingway. First, by pointing out that it would not be illogical for a condominium to belong technically to the monetary area of only one of its co-domini if that area has certain definite advantages. Secondly, the United Kingdom could argue thatthe removal of the exchange barrier between Cyprus and Greece/Turkey mightwell be against the interests of the latter. If Cyprus removed her exchange barrieragainst Greece and Turkey she would have grounds for insisting that they shouldremove theirs against her. As there is no exchange barrier between Cyprus andthe United Kingdom the way would then be open for Greek and Turkish residentsto escape their respective exchange controls via Cyprus. This might well leadto a flight of capital&apos; since local firms in those countries might transfer their reservevia Cyprus to the comparative safety of the London market, while United kingdom firms operating in Greece and Turkey would probably seek to remit substantial sums that had hitherto been blocked in those countries (the United Kingdom haslarge commercial arrears in Turkey).Thirdly, however, the United Kingdom could offer to modify the existing system: Cyprus could be allowed to administer her exchange control so as to givepreferential treatment to transfers to Greece and Turkey in certain clearly definedrespects and with proper safeguards; e.g., preferential treatment for travelallowances could be given to residents of Cyprus for Greece and Turkey (just asUnited Kingdom residents get increased allowances for Scandinavia).13. Special Status within the Sterling Area. The second possibility is of anarrangement on the lines of the present Hong Kong system. Hong Kong appliesthe normal sterling area exchange restrictions to transactions with all non-sterling countries except its four neighbouring ones. On this analogy Cyprus would cease to apply exchange restrictions against Greece and Turkey but would continue todo so against all other non-sterling countries. The special arrangements for HongKong were however permitted because they represented the only way in whichHong Kong could maintain its traditional entrepot trade; the circumstances in cyprus are completely different. Moreover, experience in Hong Kong has shownthat these arrangements are difficult to administer and despite safeguards have ledto the development of a gap in the defences of the sterling area. The UnitedKingdom cannot afford to risk the development of a new gap of this kind in theMiddle East. This alternative should therefore be regarded as unacceptable to theUnited Kingdom.14. Exclusion of Cyprus from the Sterling Area. The third possibility would be to exclude Cyprus from the sterling area and to regard her as part ofthe transferable account area; this would mean that the United Kingdom would maintain an exchange barrier between herself and Cyprus while Cyprus would be free to make whatever arrangements she considered appropriate with Greece and turkey. (If Cyprus became a condominium, she would automatically cease to bea Scheduled Territory unless special steps were taken to include her in the list.)In general, the exclusion of Cyprus from the sterling area would have little effect on direct current transactions between the United Kingdom and Cyprus(since the United Kingdom has now removed most restrictions on current payments to the transferable account area). Strict exclusion from the sterling area would however, affect capital and other transactions in the following way:  (a) all outward investment from the United Kingdom to Cyprus would besubject to exchange control restrictions;TOP: SECRET .   .
(b) sterling securities held by Cyprus residents (including the banks andCurrency Commissioners) would be blocked, i.e., the proceeds from sales of these securities would be available only for credit to a blockedaccount (and therefore transferable to Cyprus only at the &quot; securitysterling &quot; discount), or for reinvestment in certain securities with amaturity of more than five years;(c) Cyprus would have no access to the sterling area&apos;s gold and dollarsreserves: i.e., Cyprus would have to finance her dollar deficit by buyingdollars at the free market rate at Zurich (which is usually less favourable than the official rate of exchange);(d) the Government would no longer have access to the London capitalmarket for the raising of new money (but if Cyprus became a condominium she would anyway have little credit standing in theLondon Market for some years).In view of the special position of Cyprus as a condominium, it would, however,be possible for the United Kingdom to mitigate the effect of (a) and (b) by givingpreferential exchange control treatment on the same lines as at present for theSudan, and to mitigate the effect of (c) by providing that, on certain conditions,Cyprus could continue to be allocated dollars from the central reserves. However,the interposition of a barrier between Cyprus and the sterling area could hardlytake place without undesirable repercussions on her commercial community andgeneral economy.For the United Kingdom there would be no direct economic disadvantages inexcluding Cyprus from the sterling area since Cyprus is at present more of a liabilitythan an asset; she has a dollar deficit as well as an overall deficit on current account(financed to a large extent by United Kingdom Government grants and CyprusGovernment borrowing on the London Market). There is a risk that if Cypruswere to leave the sterling area but to retain several advantages of membership,some other countries might wish to follow suit; it would therefore be essentialto emphasise the special status of Cyprus as a condominium.In short, the full range of economic consequences of exclusion from the sterling area would have substantial disadvantages for Cyprus. These could, however, be mitigated to some extent by administrative action; for the United Kingdom itselfthere would be no direct economic disadvantage. The political effect might,however, be unfortunate. Exclusion from the sterling area as a consequence ofcondominium could be taken both by the Cypriots and by the other co-domini as an indication that the United Kingdom was trying to abdicate future responsibilityfor the Island as far and as fast as possible. The commercial and economic links with London would probably in any case be weakened and this loosening of tieswith Britain might further encourage Greece to use the condominium as a stepping-stone to Enosis.15. It is therefore suggested that, in negotiations, the United Kingdom should begin by offering to keep Cyprus in the sterling area on the present basis, i.e., herexisting exchange control restrictions against Greece and Turkey would remain inforce; in discussion with Greece and Turkey the danger to them of lifting theirrestrictions on capital movements via Cyprus to the sterling area should be emphasised. If Greece and Turkey object, the United Kingdom should offer toallow Cyprus to remain in the sterling area but to make certain relaxations in their favour. If, nevertheless, this alternative is not acceptable the only other possibility would be to remove Cyprus from the list of Scheduled Territories and to treat heras in the transferable account area. It would be for consideration at the timewhether the United Kingdom should offer to mitigate the full consequences of this action by administrative arrangements to take account of the special status of cyprus as a condominium.IV.-External Loans, Currency and BankingThe raising of external loans16. Any loans obtained from the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment (I.B.R.D.) would require the guarantee of all three co-domini. TheColonial Loans Acts, 1949-1952, enable Her Majesty&apos;s Government to guarantee
loans made by the International Bank to Colonial Governments, but it does notappear that r the&apos; terms of those Acts-would enable us to juar^pjsrl^R-b.&apos;loans to Cyprus as a condominium. Presumably therefore legislation would be requiredin one form or&quot; &quot;another to enable such guarantee to be given.The Cyprus Government could only have access to the London Market for the raising of loans if Cyprus were to remain within the sterling area (see paragraph14 (d) above). This would however be purely academic&apos;for some time: the condominium would need to have been established for some years and to show realprospects of providing a lasting arrangement in the eyes of the investors before there&quot; could he&apos; any question of a loan on the London Market.There would however be an immediate problem to face, namely that of securing that the rights of holders of existing.Cyprus loan stock issued in London were fullyprotected. The outstanding London stock is the Cyprus Government 3^ per cent,loan 1969/71, of which  7-848 millions has been issued. Of this,  2-54 millions was issued in August, 1950,  1-7 millions in December, 1952, and a further trancheof  3-608 millions in 1955. The 1955 tranche was taken up wholly by the CrownAgents for other Colonial Government funds, against a confidential guarantee onthe part of Her Majesty V Government which had necessarily to extend to thewhole of the issue. The terms of that guarantee, as conveyed to the Crown Agentsby the Colonial Office, with Treasury concurrence in November, 1955, are set outin the appendix.It would be undesirable if the terms of the guarantee had to be made publicon the establishment of a condominium, but it might well be impossible to avoid this. In order to protect the rights of stockholders after the establishment of a condominium we would have to seek to retain powers analogous to those ofdisallowance, of to obtain undertakings analogous to those entered into by certainCommonwealth Governments, in relation to legislation which, in the opinion ofHer majesty&apos;s government, would prejudicially affect the rights of stockholders.This miglit present considerable difficulties&apos; vis-a-vis the Greeks and the Turks(though it shouldbe noted that the range of legislation regarded as injurious tostockholders under the Colonial Stock Act, 1934, Section l(l)(a) has been interpreted(in discussions with the Indians) as referring to the general legislation governing the raising, administration and redemption of loans and not to broad economic measures). The precise nature of legislation that might be required is receivingfurther study.Currency17. Cyprus has a separate currency of its own, statutorily linked with sterling.It is automatically interchangeable with sterling at a &quot;fixed rate of exchange, andthe Currency Ordinance requires full backing to be maintained in the CurrencyFund. At present this backing is in sterling securities, but we have authorised the cyprus Government to invest up to 20 per cent, of the Fund in locally issuedsecurities, and are now considering increasing this to 30 per cent.The most sensible course would be that the present currency arrangements should continue unchanged under a condominium even if Cyprus were outside the sterling area. It would be desirable to ensure that any Bill affecting the currency of Cyprus required the consent of the three co-domini.It seems unlikely that the Greeks or the Turks would wish Greek and Turkishcurrency to be made legal tender in Cyprus. Cyprus has its own currency, and thecase for making Greek and Turkish currency legal tender as well would be hostronger than that for making United Kingdom currency legal tender. Moreover,such a proposal would be open to the objection froin a Cypriot pojnf of view that itwould limit the Cyprus Governments powers to regulate its own financial affairs.If the legal tender status of Greek and Turkish currency (both inconvertible nationalcurrencies) Were unqualified so that contracts &quot; expressed in Cyprus pounds (a currency peggecl to arid backed by sterling which is an interuatiorml currency) could;legally be discharged by payment in Greek or Turkish currency, the likely effect would be (a) to dislocate^ the currency system by driving Cyprus pounds out ofcirculation an example of &quot; Gresham&apos;s Law &quot;; all hplderg of Cypruspounds and debtors in Cyprus pounds would tend to make&quot;;a.profit;&apos;(b) -to. provide&quot;Greece and Turkey with, a-means; of ajcquiring st^rljng. again^tneif own Current *&apos;TOJP SECRET
(c) to cause a loss of revenue to the Cyprus Government from the currencyissue;id) to make nonsense of any exchange control restrictions as between Cypruson the one hand and Greece and Turkey on the other.However, it would doubtless provide a stimulus to, or facilitate, trade between turkey and Greece and Cyprus. If the legal tender status of Greek and Turkishcurrency were qualified so that contracts expressed in one of the three currenciescould be legally discharged only by payment in that particular currency it isquestionable whether Greek and Turkish currency would circulate to any significantextent, in which case there would seem to be little advantage to be derived by greece and Turkey from such a proposal but rather the reverse, in terms of prestige.It seems more likely that Greece and Turkey might press for part of the currency backing to be invested in Greece and Turkey. This would be wrong inprinciple if the Cyprus pound retained its link with sterling and it seems unlikelythat the Cypriots themselves would see any advantage in replacing currency coverheld in an international currency by cover consisting of inconvertible nationalcurrencies such as those of Greece and Turkey. This is particularly true whenCyprus is considering investing part of the sterling cover in local development.This entails greater need for the balance of cover to be in an international currency.On a point of detail, it might be necessary to replace the present notes andcoin if, as is likely, objection were taken to the continued use of the design which includes the Royal effigy. This would be a purely mechanical exercise; it wouldinvolve expense but no important point of principle.Banking18. The overseas banks operating in Cyprus are the Ottoman Bank, BarclaysD.C. &amp; O., the Ionian Bank, the National Bank of Greece and Athens, and theTurkye Is Bankasi.The establishment of a condominium would not itself cause complications,though it would be desirable to ensure that Bills regulating the business of bankingshould require the consent of the three co-domini.appendix extract from Colonial Office Letter to the Crown Agentsdated 9th November, 1955(a) Provided that the Crown Agents agree to take up an additional amount of stock of the Cyprus 34- per cent. 1969-71 issue sufficient to make available to theGovernment of Cyprus the net sum of  3 millions, Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentundertakes (i) in the event of Her Majesty&apos;s Government itself relinquishing control in cyprus at any time during the life of the loan to ensure that anysuccessor Government undertakes to discharge the liability in respect ofthe interest and sinking fund payments on, and repayment at maturity ofthe whole of the 1969-71 Cyprus Government issue, including theoriginal issue and the additional tranche;(ii) if any successor Government defaults on any such liability which it has undertaken or refuses to accept such liability Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill, subject to parliamentary approval, itself assume the liability.(b) The terms of the undertaking by Her Majesty&apos;s Government set out in (a)above may be communicated by the Crown Agents in the strictest confidence to anyof their principals who ask for an explanation of their action in taking up Cyprusstock.(c) No further issue of this stock should be made without the consent of her majesty&apos;s Government.
