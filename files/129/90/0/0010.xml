j SECRET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE property OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C0(57) 260 COPY NO.  ^ ^)5th November, 1957CABINETNATIONAL assistance memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and national insurance the Cabinet may wish to know the position on National Assistance.2.      They will recollect that, when we considered the question of improvements in social service benefits before the recess, it was feltthat it would be highly desirable that the improvement in National insurance benefits, the withdrawal of the tobacco concession, and the increases in theNational Assistance scales should be effected simultaneously.    It was,however, far from certain whether the increase in the assistance scalescould be postponed long enough so as to coincide with the earliest datepossible for the National Insurance increases.3.      The National Assistance Board last week submitted to merecommendations and draft regulations to raise the National Assistancerates by 5s. a week for a single householder, 9s. for a married couple,with corresponding adjustments for other categories, to take effect from27th January.    This is the date from which it is intended that theincrease in retirement pensions shall operate under the Bill to be presented this week.4.     After consultation with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer I have accepted the Board&apos;s recommendations, and regula-tions to implement them will be laid this week.    These regulations are subject to the affirmative procedure.5.      This time-table means that there will be a gap a week or two longer than usual between the laying of the regulations and their coming intoeffect.    This will give rise to some criticism.6.      I am satisfied that there are decisive advantages in attaining the objective discussed last summer of a simultaneous operation.    Mycolleagues will recall the trouble which we had in 1955 when the increases in National Insurance benefits took place some two months after theincrease in National Assistance scales.    The result was that a verylarge number of supplemented pensioners felt aggrieved that they werederiving no benefit from the latter operation.    Simultaneous operation is even more important on this occasion since, in the case of supplementedretirement pensioners (of whom perhaps half a million have tobaccotokens), it is only through an increase in the National Assistance scalesthat compensation for withdrawal of the tobacco concession can be given,and this concession will continue to be enjoyed until the 27th January.There is also the fact that the Board have more work to do this timebecause of the combined operation.-1-SECRET
7.      Further, although there will be some criticism that these scales donot operate before Christmas (which would, in any event, have been impossible), the present rates of assistance judged bfath by the Index of retail Prices and by the &quot;Mikardo Index&quot; have not yet fallen below the1948 standard, though they have done so according to the Board&apos;s ownconfidential and, for this purpose, more relevant calculations.     Under theLabour Government the National Assistance scales were allowed to fallsubstantially below the 1948 standard before action was taken.    And,unlike that action, our present proposals will amount to an improvement on the 1948 standard.8.      I ought to add that both the Board and 1 considered the possibilityof shortening the gap by delaying the making of a recommendation for a couple of weeks or so.     We came, however, to the conclusion that silenceon this subject would be very difficult to defend against the background ofthe other steps being taken after the resumption of Parliament.J.A.B.-c ministry of Pensions and national insurance, W. C. 2.4th November, 1957.-2-
