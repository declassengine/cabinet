Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1957C. (57) 288 Copy No.16th December, 1957CABINETWAGE PROBLEMSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of LabourIt may be useful to have a summary of the present position and outlook.2. The Government statement of 19th September represented a marked shiftin the emphasis of economic policy. Previously the objective was full employment,with the hope for price stability through restraint by industry. Now the primaryobjective is maintenance of the value of the currency, i.e., price stability, and theGovernment has made it plain that, unless restraint is exercised, employmentprospects are bound to be damaged.3. The measures of 19th September could only be expected to be felt withthe passage of time, and at present economic activity is at a high level and not likely to fall off much during the winter.4. But public response to Government announcements has been on the wholeencouraging, and especially where Government actions have showed that we meanwhat we say. We should continue with our policies to slow down the pace of wage increases generally, and avoid, as far as we can, settlements on theGovernment front ahead of the main struggle in the industrial field. The tradeunions clearly do not wish public opinion to regard them as the main barrier tostable prices, and though they continue to put in the usual exaggerated wage claims, they are pursuing them cautiously and slowly.5. We shall be judged by the extent to which we maintain a firm front, andthe immediate success of our policy depends on this. The best chance of avoidingsevere strikes is to see that the country is convinced that we mean what we have said and that we will face these if we must.6. Subject to this general attitude, we will have to deal with particular problems as they arise. We cannot decide on tactics except in the light of tacticalsituations.7. In the short term at least no alteration is possible irl the present system of collective bargaining, arbitration, wages councils, &amp;c. For example, the minister is obliged to provide, in certain cases, for arbitration, and to confirm awards bywages councils. The conciliation service of the Ministry (which, of course, dealswith many disputes unconnected with wages) must continue to be available to industry if required, but we have clearly reached the point where even a seriousstrike is more tolerable than a continuance of inflationary wage-settlements.8. In present circumstances, arbitration can be a useful safety-valve. We havemade our point that arbitrators should have regard to the national interest and cannot usefully develop that line further at present.  Otherwise we may find that52728
arbitration is universally avoided. We have made it clear that in the public field we will accept arbitration awards, but that additional Exchequer moneys to meet them will not be provided: they will thus have to be met as far as practicable out of economies in working and services. It is not desirable for us to say in public thatat all costs prices will be kept from rising in the public sector, because in some cases that may be inevitable, especially where the only alternative would be an additional burden on the Exchequer. Through what we have already said and the kind of actions we have already taken in this field, we have given as much guidance as wecan at this stage to private industry.9. There is not very much more that can be done in the short run. If we haveto make speeches we should continue to make clear where we think the national interest lies and the consequences for employment if we have a repetition of recent experience in regard to wages, salaries and other incomes. In order to preservea balance we should continue the recent line of stressing the need and opportunities for some price reductions, e.g., through lower import costs and improved techniques and investment. It may be helpful also to repeat what we said in the House ofCommons on 29th October, that general restraint in distribution of profits would help our national purpose.10. On the wider question of future wage policy, a number of fundamentalproblems are involved. It would not be right, even if it were possible, to reachfinal answers on this in a hurry. No doubt our own attitude would be somewhataffected by the outcome of this winter&apos;s wage round. Officials have already begunwork on the report for which we asked. In the meantime it would be well to avoiddogmatic statements- on the future of arbitration or collective bargaining, lestthereby we limit our freedom for subsequent manoeuvre.11.   To sum up:  (i) We should persevere in our general policies as already announced.(ii) Subject to this we must leave tactics in particular cases to be decided inthe light of the tactical situation.(iii) We should continue with public utterances on existing lines, including the fresh emphasis on the possibility of some price reductions.(iv) We should avoid committal statements about the future forms ofarbitration, or collective bargaining.(v) On general policy we should await the report of officials.P.
