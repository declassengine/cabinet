confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. November 1957C. (57) 278 Copy No.18th November, 1957CABINETMALTA: NAVAL DOCKYARDSNote by the Secretary of State for the colonies circulate for the information of my colleagues a paper bythe Maltese Government giving their observations on the problemof the naval dockyard. This is the paper referred to in my memorandum C. (57) 268.A. L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W. 1,15th November, 1957.
MEMORANDUM BY THE MALTESE GOVERNMENT ON THE MALTADOCKYARDIt is understood that Her Majesty^ Government are considering theeconomic and strategic aspects of maintaining Naval dockyards at home and overseas. The Maltese Government have not been made aware of the facts on thebasis of which this problem is being decided. Accordingly they limit themselvesto the following observations of a general character.2. The Maltese Government believe there are substantial advantages in having forward bases to deal with sudden local crises. This was proved in thecase of Suez last year. Moreover, in a global war there should be advantages in not having &quot; all one&apos;s eggs in one basket.&quot;3. So far as the economics of the matter are concerned, it is certainly lesscostly to retain the Maltese base as the economic dislocation would undoubtedly be far greater in Malta than in the United Kingdom. In the following paragraphsit is demonstrated that the only feasible method of dealing with this problem isto keep the Malta dockyard going for as long as possible in order to allow for the transformation of the Maltese economy from one based almost entirely on defence to one less dependent on Service expenditure.4. There are two alternative ways of dealing with the unemployment created by discontinuing the Naval dockyard in Malta:  (a) the people now employed in the dockyard and others whose incomesdepend on their expenditure have to be transferred elsewhere,i.e., either to Britain or Australia; or(b) new employment has to be found by the Government and/or private firms;(or a mixture of the two).5. We shall first consider the case that the Maltese dockyard is closed downwithout any period of adjustment being provided for if only to demonstrate terrible social and economic consequences of this extreme policy.6. The total national income of Malta in 1956 was  38 -1 millions. Theoutput which was generated by activities wholly independent of the Services wasa mere fraction of this, about  2-5 millions, with a maximum of  3-5 millions.The rest of the national income depended directly or indirectly on Serviceexpenditure and British grants amounting to  25 -1 millions in toto. Thus the closing of the dockyard and the discontinuance of Naval activities in Malta nowgenerating  11-4 millions would require an emigration of at least three times thedischarges plus families. This would represent some 42,000 wage-earners plusfamilies, or nearly 50 per cent, of the Maltese population. This figure assumes thatthe War Department, Air Ministry, NATO and United States expenditure wouldbe maintained at the 1956 level and the British Government maintained its help to the finances of the Maltese Government, at least at the present level.7. If no alternative employment were provided the cost of transplantingsome 42,000 men plus dependants say conservatively altogether 150,000-wouldhave to be met. The cost of emigrant flights is about  12 per head. Even if alarge saving is envisaged and the movement is staggered the cost of transport,of providing reception centres, &amp;c, will certainly not be less than  13 per person,or say  2 millions. The Maltese immigrants would represent a net addition tothe British population whose growth is already higher than the rate of house-building. One way or another additional houses will have to be built especially if the Maltese are settled in areas of great labour shortage. The cost of housing and social services including education for 35,000-37,000 families would not beless than  50 millions and the current cost of hospitals, schools, and family allowances will be higher for these migrants than for the average British employee(and additional capital expenditure will become inevitable).
8. The Australian Government has made it clear to the Maltese Governmentthat under no circumstances would they be prepared to accept more than 5,000migrants per year. Even so, for every thousand taken by Australia, the shippingcharges would increase by  100,000. Against this, however, for every thousandwho emigrate to Australia, the United Kingdom expenditure on housing woulddecrease pari passu, i.e., in the previous example by  350,000.9. Even if this operation could be successfully accomplished, severe losseswould be suffered in Malta. The capital and the income of the higher-incomeclasses, including land and house-owners, doctors, lawyers, &amp;c, would shrinkand Government revenue would drop much more than in proportion to the lossof population. This would happen both if these classes were to emigrate or ifthey stayed at home. The few Maltese industries and agriculture would see theirmarket shrink and lose accordingly. Yet certain basic services, such as education,would have to be maintained, and Maltese Government services would have to be subsidised by greater absolute amounts than they are now. On a first roughestimate the maximum possible saving in Government expenditure would not bemore than some  1 - 8 millions per annum, while revenue is likely to decline bymore than  4 - 5 millions. The actual loss would thus be some  2 - 7 millions. It istrue of course that there would be some saving in capital expenditure, but thiswill no more than partly offset the continuous drain that could be expected. these calculations leave out of account entirely the hardships suffered inevitably by theuprooting of a considerable proportion of an island population which is so closelyknit and which will find living conditions in England in the circumstances of mass-emigration far from satisfactory.10. The provision of alternative employment will now be considered. If the maltese Government is to provide direct employment for 14,000 additional people,it will find it extremely difficult to do so on the present basis. At the moment thecost of employing labour is only about twice the amount of wages paid out, becausethe cost of material and machines required for the bulk of the public works in malta is roughly the same as the amount of wages. But the bulk of these publicworks are rather of a simple nature, e.g., water-works, roads, sewers and simplebuildings. If the manpower in direct Malta Government employment is to bedoubled (and the absorption of 14,000 men would in fact mean doubling the manpower) much more housing would have to be undertaken and some industrial employment would have to be found as the size of the present public works programme could not be doubled. In any case, skilled dockyard workers cannotbe put on road and sewer works for any length of time. Even if the disastroussocial consequences of keeping people idle on the dole, or giving them makeshiftwork, are ignored, the cost would be prohibitive.11. There is no doubt that the cheapest remedial measure is the setting up ofnew industries on the Island. Under normal conditions and without the additionalpressure of having to fulfil the moral obligation of providing alternative employment to men who are being discharged, the attraction of potential industries to Maltaimplies inducements at least comparable to those in operation in Italy and NorthernIreland. These incentives are of the order of 25 per cent, to 35 per cent, by way ofcapital grants and the subsidisation of recurrent costs, e.g., fuel and subsidies toother current expenses. On the basis of two potential projects which were submitted to the Maltese Government quite recently (one having a high labourcontent and the other one having lower manpower requirements) it is estimatedthat in order to provide employment for 14,000 men (the total Maltese Admiraltycomplement) a total capital investment of  52 millions would be required.Therefore a grant of, say, 25 per cent, would bring the initial cost of inducingindustrialisation to about  13 millions. If capital investment were to be guaranteedthe initial cost would no doubt be smaller, but the eventual liability would be muchgreater.* But to force the pace at this very unfavourable time and set up industriesat short notice would obviously necessitate greater capital inducements, and alarger measure of recurrent subsidisation. The shorter the period which one allows for the process of industrialisation the greater the cost. On the other hand,careful synchronisation of discharges with the provision of alternative employment would lower costs to a minimum. The success of technical education would muchfacilitate the process of industrialisation but it will necessarily take time.* The Maltese Government is fully convinced that this method would not work in the case of malta.
12. During the Round Table Conference doubts were expressed about the feasibility of making Malta completely independent of the Services even in 25 years.Any lesser period will certainly involve drastic subsidies. Moreover, the EuropeanCommon Market and Free Trade Area plans have imparted a new uncertainty intothe picture. Thus in the short run (and it is impossible to define the duration ofthis because we do not know how long the uncertainties about these problems willlast) there is no hope for substantial progress in industrialisation in industriesdepending mainly on the commercial arrangements between Britain and theContinent.13. In any case a Committee has now been formed with the full support and encouragement of the United Kingdom Government of highly placed and publicspirited industrialists in the United Kingdom to advise on and promote thediversification of the Maltese economy. From a preliminary meeting between thePrime Minister and the Chairman of this Committee it became clear that members would feel greatly discouraged and embarrassed if before they have even been giventhe chance of sizing up the problem and deciding on what action to take to promoteindustrialisation, the British Government took steps which would destroy overnightthe existing source of national income. Their advice on the possibilities of obtaining the co-operation of British industrialists is essential. On the other hand, their taskmust not be frustrated by a premature crisis brought on by the creation of additionaluncertainties through threats of closing the dockyard. The very fact that the BritishGovernment is considering the closing down of the Malta dockyard has already ledto a breakdown of the plans of a Danish/Dutch group to start work on acommercial dry dock scheme. So long as it is not known what use will be madeof the existing dockyard facilities no industrial group will risk their capital in thisurgently needed extension of work opportunities, while work is proceeding inTaranto on competitive dry-docking schemes.14. The possibility of the dockyard being taken over by a commercial firm orfirms has also been investigated. British firms have examined in detail theirmanpower requirements on two assumptions; firstly if they receive no work fromthe Navy and secondly if Naval work is forthcoming. In the first instance, the fullcomplement would not exceed 2-3,000 men, and in the second, not more than5-7,000.15. Even in the best case, the workless would number 7,000. A large number some 3,500 would be non-manual workers; clerks and minor manipulative staff for whom employment in Malta could not possibly be found. It would be extremelydifficult for these non-industrial workers to find employment overseas. Butassuming that they do, the loss of Maltese national income would bring aboutsimilar problems in respect of some additional 7,000 wage-earners. Thus, even ifthis operation were successful, a total emigration programme of some 10,000workers plus their families would be necessary.16. This leaves 3,500 older and less skilled manual workers to be placed inemployment. Two possibilities exist: either they will be given direct employment by the Government (very unsatisfactory in the long run) in which case the cost would be roughly  2 millions per annum; or alternative private employment in new industries has to be found. The cost of this exercise has been indicated inparagraph 11.17. If the Navy did not supplement the work of the private dockyard, thetotal number of unemployed would be 11-12,000. Thus, the magnitude of theproblem will not be considerably reduced by the transfer of the dockyard to private firms. (This is not necessarily so, since the Naval dockyards were built and organised to fulfil special Naval requirements). The cost that would have to be incurred for emigration or the provision of alternative employment in Malta can be easily deduced from calculations already supplied.18. From the foregoing it is clear that if the solemn undertaking assumed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the June /July 1955 Declaration is to be honoured,it would be considerably cheaper to close, for example, Chatham dockyard, asworkers there may be expected to be able to find alternative employment onaccount of the great labour shortage in that area.
19. The calculations in paragraph 10 onwards have, been made on theassumption that only the Dockyard would be closed and the Naval expenditure cut,but that the activities of the other defence departments in Malta would continueundiminished and the British Government continue its help at the present level.Should this assumption not hold good, the unemployment would be heavier andthe ensuing problems more complex. Thus the reduction of the activities of theServices must be co-ordinated with the provision of alternative local employment.20. It has also been shown that the cost of providing alternative employmentcan be considerably reduced if cuts in defence expenditure were to be postponed until industrialisation is well under way.8th November, 1957.
