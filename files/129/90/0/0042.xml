Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1957C. (57) 29216th December, 1957 :RENTS IN scotland memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland on 20th November the Home Affairs Committee approved in principleproposals now before me for increasing the rents of some 50,000 houses in Scotlandbelonging to certain Government-sponsored bodies the Scottish Special housing association, the First and Second Scottish National Housing Companies, and theNew Town Corporations of East Kilbride and Glenrothes.2. The Committee felt, however, that in view of the possibility of politicaland industrial repercussions, the matter should be reported to the Cabinet.3. Briefly, what is involved is that the average rent of these houses (exclusive of rates) is to be doubled, with the proviso, however, that no tenant will be askedto pay an increase of more than Is. 6d. a week.4. The rents of Association houses are already higher than those of comparable local authority houses in most districts, and the proposed increases would accentuate the disparity. In the district where the disparity would begreatest, there would be a difference of 13s. lid a week in the total burden forrent and rates but in this instance the local authority&apos;s rent for a four-apartmenthouse is only 2s. Ad. a week.5.   A rent rebate scheme is to be operated to meet any cases of hardship.6. The proposals are reasonable but their approval will almost certainly befollowed by strong opposition in several districts. Representations and protestshave indeed already been received from local authorities and from organisationsclaiming to speak for the tenants, who have indicated their intention to resist the increases by all legal means.7. The opposition is likely to take the form of rent strikes, involving courtaction for recovery of arrears and probably the arrestment of wages. In miningdistricts all this may be backed by industrial stoppages. This was the pattern ofthe opposition to increases of rent imposed earlier this year by Dumfries CountyCouncil opposition which is at present in abeyance pending a decision on an action for interdict ii.e., an injunction) taken on behalf of some of the tenantsagainst the County Council in the Court of Session.8. The Scottish Law Officers have advised that in view of the terms of agreements entered into with certain local authorities in respect of houses builtbefore the war, the Association should consult all the 84 local authorities in whose districts the Association have built houses, before the increases in rent are put into operation.9. I consider that it is important, before these consultations are embarkedupon, that a preliminary announcement should be made in the Press presenting the rent increase proposals in proper perspective to forestall deliberate attempts tomisrepresent or distort them. The Minister of Labour has suggested, in the context of wage claims, that this announcement should be made in early January.Copy NoV52CABINET52724
10. I propose, therefore, to ask the Association to announce the rentproposals and begin consultations with local authorities on 15th January.Allowing a maximum of two months for the consultations, and providing for aperiod of three months&apos; notice to be given to the tenants thereafter, the increases would come into operation in June or July 1958. I should seek to secure that the&quot;increases ip the New Towns would operate from about the same time.11.   I should be glad to know that my colleagues agree that I should proceed as proposed.J. S. M.Scottish Office, S.W. 1,13th December, 1957.
