Wt. 38S49/D.1291   50m   8/S7   P.I.   Gp. 1144THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of......................................................TOP SECRET coPy No.. *7C.(57) 28629th November, 1957CABINETWAGESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Cabinet considered on 28th November the specific issues raised in C.(57) 28C by the Minister of Health on &quot;Wages in the national health Service&quot; (C.C.(57) 82nd Conclusions, Minute 5).    That paperalso raised some general issues in regard to wages and arbitration,which are discussed also in C. (57) 264, by the Minister of Labour,on &quot;Wages:  Collective Bargaining and Arbitration&quot;.    I have asked thatthe paper which 1 circulated to the Cabinet last April on &quot;Wages, prices and the Pound Sterling&quot; (C.(57) 103) should be made available forfurther discussion.2.      These papers bear on two aspects of our problem - one shortterm and the other longer term.    The first is how to avoid in theimmediate future a repetition of wage increases on the disastrous scale of the past few years.     The second is whether we can devise a generally acceptable method of preventing wage increases from out-strippingproduction when expansion can again be encouraged.3.      We have already formulated and publicly announced, as far as is appropriate, our policy in regard to the shorter term, both as regardswages generally and in regard to wages in the public sector in particular.1 summarised the guiding principles as follows in the House of Commons:-&quot;The role of the Government and its policy can be quite clearly stated.     First, the Government should state withabsolute clarity their own view of the economic situation,and where they consider the national interest to lie.Secondly, they should, by their monetary, fiscal and spend-ing policies, create conditions and an economic climateconsistent with this view.    Thirdly, they should not inter-fere with collective bargaining, and fourthly, they should,where they are themselves the employer, seek to followpolicies similar to those which they urge upon others.11These guiding principles were subsequently re-stated by the PrimeMinister in C.(57) 261.4.     We have no reason to be dissatisfied with the results of ourshort-term policy so far.    We must, however, keep one fact in thefront of our minds.    However rough the going or unpopular the cause,we must do everything we can to hold wage increases.    Because much--1-TOP ?T;CRET
of the field is outside our control, there is an added importance in what we do ourselves.    A tolerable case can be made out for almost anywage increase looked at in isolation.    A halt at any point in what isnow regarded as the almost automatic right to an annual rise in response to the self-generated price increases, will catch someone out of line.Nonetheless, we must try to slow down the pace of wage increases in thepublic sector and as far as possible seek to avoid settlements on theGovernment front ahead of the main wage struggle in the industrial field.5.     It is upon our own actions that industry will judge us, and to alarge extent decide their own attitude.    When the Minister of Labourand I met the British Employers&apos; Confederation recently it was plain that they attached the highest importance to the fact that we had said&quot;NO&quot;: that we meant &quot;NO&quot;:  and that we showed no signs of wavering.6.     Our short-term policy seems to be provoking constructivethought on all sides about the future.    Lord Chandos has suggestedlong-term wage agreements with a 2j per cent annual increase.    TheEconomic Committee of the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.), althoughcritical of the Government, recognise that solution of the problem&quot;can only be achieved if all sections of the community are willing to limit to some degree their freedom of action&quot;.    Lord Cohen1sCommittee are at work on some of these questions.    We should, there-fore, in public utterances avoid committing ourselves firmly to thepresent forms of collective bargaining and arbitration.    While I agree with some of the points made in paragraph 16 of C. (57) 264 bythe Minister of Labour, I do not think that we should reiterate in thewords of his paper &quot;we have not got a national wages policy but weneither intend to have one nor is it possible to have one&quot;.    Nor should we exclude the possibility that in one way or another we may have tobring home to arbitrators the national aspect of particular wage claims.Before we are finished, we may have to have some - resembling both.The questions posed by the Minister of Health in his paper on these points are relevant:  and they were referred to in my paper C.(57) 103.7.      Meanwhile we are entering rough water and we need to keepourselves free in the next few months to seize any opportunity whichmay present itself^    It is conceivable that the Government might duringthis period have an opportunity to express its attitude to the long-termwage problem with constructive effect.    This might be before or after a strike, or in response to a T. U. C. offer, or in response to somewave of public opinion, or arising from a Report of the Cohen Committee.We need at any rate to be ready.    I consider that we should put in handa study by officials cf the proposals set out in C.(57) 103, together withthose which have since come to light, including those dealt with in the papers of the two Ministers.8.     To sum up, I recommend that we should:-(i)    persevere in our policies as already announced;(i)
(ii)    avoid saying anything in public which commits us to maintaining existing forms of arbitration orcollective bargaining;  and(iii)    authorise study of the proposals set out in C. (57) 103,together with others which have since come to light.P.T,&apos;reasury Chambers, S. W.T.29th November, 1957.-3
