SECRET j[g2(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(57) 287 COPY NO.27th November, 1957CABINETWAGES:  NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Minister of Labour and national service do not wish in this memorandum to deal with all the considerationsraised by the Minister of Health in his paper C. (57) 280, some of whichmight appropriately be discussed on my paper C, (57) 264, which I have prepared on arbitration and allied matters.     This memorandum is there-fore concerned solely with the proposal made in paragraph 10(a) ofC. (57) 280.2.        It seems tc me that with all its difficulties the decision taken bythe Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Health not to approve the Whitley Council recommendation was the right one.    It has created the atmosphere which we wanted to create.    Beyond question it hashad a profound effect in convincing people both at home and abroad thatthe Government are serious about their attack on inflation.3. Nevertheless it is right that we should look ahead and consider our future attitude.    There seem to be three courses:-(a) To regard the Ministers&apos; decision as final and to refuseto reconsider this particular recommendation.(b) To give consent to a case going to arbitration if this is asked for by the Staff Side.(c) To reconsider the recommendation after an appropriateinterval.     (This review would be in line with theMinisters&apos; original letter.)4.        I feel that (a) is indefensible.    We could not, in taking up thisstand, at the same time deny the Unions both arbitration and review withina reasonable period.    In these matters public opinion is of greatimportance.    We cannot hope to urge arbitration on the Trade union movement following on disagreement and at the same time refuse arbitra-tion (or even review) where there is none.    Especially when, as in this case, the workers are ill-paid, ill-organised, and where recruitment is entirely inadequate.5.        Nor would I wish to accept alternative (b), which is what theMinister of Health proposes.     In my view it would be wrong for ministers to consent to subject themselves to arbitration in respect of decisions taken by them in the exercise of their statutory duties.    To do so is toplace upon the arbitrators the responsibility of stating whether theMinister was right or wrong in the decision reached in the use of his-1-SECRET
SECRET163Ministerial prerogative.    I cannot help feeling too that reference to arbitration in such circumstances might also have a profound effect onthe future relations between the Whitley Council and the Minister.6. In my view, alternative (c) is the one to pursue.    But to under-take a review within a stated period might give the impression that theeconomic position was likely to be so much improved by a certain date as to justify a loosening in wage restraint generally. This could haveundesirable repercussions in outside industry.,7.        A promise to review must therefore be based on some other circumstances and it occurs to me that, if it could be foreseen that theproposals in the Noel Hall Report could be worked out within say 3-months, this would form a useful peg on which to hang a more comprehensive review of the wages structure.     I realise that the result of the whitley council&apos;s examination *f the Noel Hall Report might be a heavier wagesbill for the administrative and clerical staffs and that all its proposals might not be acceptable.    But in my view the revaluation of the work whichthe Report recommends cannot be compared in terms of inflationaryeffect and repercussions with a straight wages increase.8.        In these circumstances I propose that the Staff Side of the whitley council should be informed that, in the light of the consideration whichwill be given in due course to the Whitley Council&apos;s views on the Noel HallReport, the Minister will be prepared at the same time t** take intoaccount the representations which have been made on the wages rates ofofficers now receiving less than  1,200 per annum.I.M.Ministry of Labour and NationalService, S. W. 1.26th November, 1957.-2-
