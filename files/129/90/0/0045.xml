THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of.............................................................TOP SECRET Copy No.0.(57)2952?th December,  1957CABINETTHE 1958/59 CIVIL ESTIMATESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer we have very difficult decisions to take about expenditure.We must however take them or we shall be faced with still moredifficult decisions later,2.     On 19th September we stated that we were no longerprepared to finance inflation.      In the public sector we havelimited investment, and in the private sector, bank advances.Our reply to those who ask about the Government&apos;s own current expenditure was to say that &quot;steps have been taken and are beingtaken to limit current civil and defence expenditure&quot;,3,      In the event, Supplementary Estimates this year will amountto about  100 million above the Budget estimate,      worse still,-the Civil Estimates as submitted for 1958/59 show the largestincrease ever recorded in peace-time.     They are  275 million higher than the original Estimates for this year, and 175 million higher than the total Estimates,,     My colleagues will no doubt understand my attitude, however much they maydeplore the need for difficult decisions which flow from it,when I say that I cannot in any circumstances approve estimates of this magnitude,h.      It has &quot;been argued that since the Gross National Product(G,N,P.) is increasing, we can afford some increase inGovernment expenditure without inflation.     Most of the increasehas of course been in money terms and to cottnt on this would/be
be to take credit in advance for the very inflation which we seek to cure.    The increase in the real national income lookslike running at about 1^ per annum.    If we take credit forthe Governmenfs share in the whole of this at present ratesof taxation - which we certainly ought not to do in the face of continuing inflationary pressure - it only represents an extra  75 million.    I emphasise that of course this assumesno reduction whatsoever in taxation.5.     Moreover, before we take this questionable credit, thereare also certain debits which we must record.    Next year weface maturing debts of  1,268 million, which represents anincrease of  365 million above the figure of this year, weface increased charges on the National Debt, and no reductionappears in prospect of the Defence Budget.    It would be unwise to count on a greater volume of non-inflationary lending tothe Government.    It suffices for me to say at present that theline of argument based on a growth in G.N.P., itself dangerousin an inflationary context, would not justify anything likethe increases now in prospect.6.     In fact we are still in an inflationary condition.    the note issue has just hit a new record high level.    the floating debt is more than  5C0 million above what it was this time last year.    Profits are still too high and relativelyeasy to get;    unemployment is low.    There are many in thebusiness world who do not really believe that we mean what wesay.    Confidence in sterling is suspended rather thanestablished.    We do not know the outcome of the struggle onthe wages front, but inflationary Government expenditure isno way to ensure success and failure would in any case demandquick deflationary action./I.    It
7.     It is clear, therefore, that any substantial increase inthe Civil Estimates over this year&apos;s swollen out-turn is noteconomically or politically practicable.   It would make taxincreases probable and it would increase inflation.    Above allit would make clear to the world that we were unwilling tocarry out in our own house-keeping the policy we are enforcingboth in public (investment) and in private spending,t8,     I am sometimes asked what we should do to end thisannual  crisis over the Estimates.    I fear that the answerremains that these crises will recur so long as we continueto attempt more than we can manage.    With relatively fewassets and large debts we continue to live upon the scale ofa great power.    We have the most expensive defence forces inEurope,   We have joined the nuclear &quot;club&quot;.    We claim at thesame time a very high standard of life.    We seek to lead theworld in the Social Services which we provide.   All of thisis very hard to change.    But; we must recognise that out failure in one year adequately to face the problem sows theseeds of precisely the same kind of problem in the year which follows,9.     There is, therefore, no easy solution.    The draft civil estimates are now being discussed between the Treasury and departments,   I have instructed the Treasury - and in thisI am sure I shall have my colleagues&apos;  support - to adopt avery restrictive attitude\ide towards new services, at home and overseas; which are not yet approved or beg-on, and to presswherever possible for the deferment of expenditure which isnot immediately necessary.    It is too soon as yet to say how much the Estimates can be reduced by the ordinary proceduresstringently applied but, short of any major policy decisions,&quot;tftie total reduction is not likely to be more than  1+0 million./(This
(This comparatively meagre figure is of course largely due tothe efforts made by my colleagues, which I gladly recognise,to reduce their draft Estimates as nearly as possible to thepresent year&apos;s figureB)10.    This reduction is not nearly enough.      It is clear thatthere will remain a sizeable gap, which can only be bridged by major decisions of policy.      I am considering what form such decisions might best take and shall be making suggestions in thevery near futureoP.T.Treasury Chambers, S.Wol.20th December, 1957o
