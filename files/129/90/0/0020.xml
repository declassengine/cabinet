Printed for the Cabinet. November 1957C. (57) 270 Copy No.18th November, 1957CABINETREGENT&apos;S PARK TERRACESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Lord Privy seal i circulate a draft statement which the Crown Estate Commissioners proposeto make on the future of the regent&apos;s  Park Terraces. The terraces are shown onthe attached map. The decisions which the Commissioners propose to announceare briefly:  (a) that a number of the terraces will in any event be preserved. The includePark Crescent, Park Square (East and West), York Gate, HanoverTerrace, Kent Terrace and Cumberland Terrace;(b) that every effort will be made to preserve other Nash Terraces, and that no immediate decision to demolish any of them will be taken;(c) that Cambridge Gate and Someries House will be demolished and new buildings erected on the site.2. The only part of the statement which may excite some controversy is thedecision to demolish Cambridge Gate (built only in 1876) and Someries House.Neither of these buildings has any great architectural merit and the GorellCommittee, in considering &quot;the future of the terraces in 1946, recommended that both of them should be demolished. It does not therefore seem likely that therewill be any serious criticism of the Commissioner^ v decision.3. Under the terms of the Crown Estate Act, 1956, the Commissioners areresponsible for the management of the estates in their care, subject to any &quot; orders,instructions and directions &quot; which may be given to them by the responsible minister, who is, in England and Wales, the Lord Privy Seal. I do not considerthat I should be justified in using the power of direction to prevent theCommissioners from proceeding with the demolition of Cambridge Gate andSomeries House.4. The remainder of the draft statement seems to me to be a well-arguedpaper with the objective of preserving as many of the Nash Terraces as possible,at the least reasonable public expense. Whether the Commissioners will attaintheir objective remains to be seen, but I think that they should be allowed to havea try.5. I would therefore propose to inform the Commissioners that I see noobjection to the issue of the proposed statement, and to arrange for its terms to be circulated in the Official Report at the same time as it is made public by theCommissioners.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,14th November, 1957.
THE FUTURE OF THE REGENTS PARK TERRACESDraft of Statement by the Crown Estate CommissionersOn our appointment a year ago as Crown Estate Commissioners one of themost important problems we found was the future of the buildings surroundingand leading to Regent&apos;s Park. This problem has existed at least since 1946 when a Government Committee, under Lord Gorell, considered the future of theTerraces. There are 374 houses in the twenty-two Terraces around the Parkor forming its entrances. We make no apology for not having made an earlierpublic statement about these buildings first, because of the difficulties of theproblem, and, secondly, because nearly all the buildings are occupied and are not,at least at present, deteriorating. Most of the terraces and buildings concerned,but not all, were designed by John Nash, who was the architect employed by our predecessors, about 130 years ago.2.   We now announce:-(i) That a number of Nash Terraces will definitely be preserved for effective use for many years to come.(ii) That an attempt will be made to secure the same result for all the otherTerraces designed by Nash or his contemporary, Decimus Burton, ifthis can be achieved without undue capital cost.(iii) That, while an assured future cannot yet be foreseen for all the Nash andDecimus Burton Terraces, present plans do not provide for the demolition of any such Terrace, or for the elevation of any suchTerrace to be altered.The accompanying note and its schedule give some of the history and facts aboutthe regent&apos;s  Park Terraces and adjacent buildings.GENERAL PRINCIPLES3. Perhaps the major contribution of Nash was his creation of RegenfsPark itself, its entrances, and gardens. None of these can, or will, be altered,except perhaps in detail. We therefore speak only of his Terraces and not of his great planning layout.4. Accepting the unique character of Nash&apos;s Terraces in regent&apos;s  Park, weare clear that they (a) cannot be left in their present state, doomed to early decay;(b) cannot be demolished merely to erect modern replicas; and(c) cannot all be restored to effective use if the cost would be anything like 8 to  10 millions the present equivalent of the estimates put beforethe Gorell Committee.Equally we are clear that, before considering demolition, we must try to secure some effective use for them by restoration, coupled with a moderate financialreturn on the capital to be employed.5. We first thought that, side by side with our investigation into thepreservation of the Terraces, we should institute a national competition for amaster plan for new buildings surrounding regent&apos;s  Park so that a comparisoncould be made between the appearance and cost of buildings erected by modernarchitects, and of Nash Terraces converted to modern use. Decisions would then have been deferred until the results of the proposed competition for a &quot; masterplan &quot; for the Estate were available. After seeking advice, we have decided to omit such a competition at this stage, and to concentrate entirely on the possible methods of preserving by conversion the present Terraces for effective use.6. The biggest problem is the structural condition&quot; of the Terraces. Wecould not recommend very large amounts of capital being expended unless they
would result in a further life for the buildings of at least 60 years. Alarmingevidence was given before the Gorell Committee on this subject. We do not yetaccept or reject this evidence given over 10 years ago. Experience has been gainedin the meantime by our predecessors, by the Ministry of Works and by developerswho have been converting old houses in various places. We propose to test thismatter by practical samples carried out by ourselves and others, and we shall try to interest any expert who can suggest a lowering of the costs.DECISIONS TAKENPark Crescent, Park Square East and West, and York Gate7. We have decided to preserve and rebuild, where destroyed or damaged,Park Crescent, Park Square East and West, and York Gate, and to complete the extensive works already carried out to restore as far as possible their originalfacades. These Terraces, comprising 61 houses, constitute the main Southernentrances to the Park, and are, in our view, its most important features.Leases will be granted or extended, and it is our hope that the restorations canbe carried out without any subsidy. We must, however, continue to be given some latitude in departing from purely residential use and, in this connection, weacknowledge with gratitude the help already given by the London County Council.We may have to ask for some further help in order to justify a return on the large capital expenditure involved.Hanover and Kent Terraces8. We shall retain all the 38 houses in Hanover Terrace and Kent Terrace.None-of these has been used as offices, and nearly all are occupied by one, or atthe most two, families as houses or maisonettes. We think that the houses inthese two terraces have a further &quot; economic &quot; life of at least 20 years. Weshall, therefore, offer to grant or extend leases throughout each of these Terracesfor about this period in return for the carrying out of improvements or the payment- of increased rents. It would be premature now to consider their future after thatperiod but it is possible that the period could later be extended.Cumberland Terrace9. Some evidence exists of the large cost of converting the houses in NashTerraces into modern accommodation comprising flats. We think it is vital thatwe should obtain up-to-date and practical experience of the actual cost of a largesample. Cumberland Terrace (33 houses) is largely unoccupied, and we havedecided ourselves to convert the Terrace within its present main walls, togetherwith some houses adjoining and the Mews property behind. It is clear that wecannot expect anything like a normal commercial return from this expenditure.We feel, however, that any large landowner with the necessary means should beready to make some unprofitable contribution to preserve lovely buildings. Thiswill be our main contribution in regent&apos;s  Park.Immediately after the war St. Pancras Borough Council expressed someinterest in Cumberland Terrace for their housing purposes, and later LondonUniversity showed similar interest in taking over the Terrace as a UniversityHostel. Each authority, after obtaining advice, came to the conclusion that the conversion would be too expensive for it to contemplate.We have engaged Mr. Louis de Soissons, R.A., to design and supervise theseconversions, and preparations are well advanced. Our present information is thatthe cost would be not less than  750,000. The plans involve the production of6 small houses, 48 high-rented flats and 29 single or two-roomed flats, with 44garages. The north block would be retained as 6 single houses. We have engageda structural engineer and a quantity surveyor, and intend that work should startas soon as possible.Cambridge Gate, Someries House and Cambridge Terrace10. The only Terrace we propose to demolish, as soon as possession can beobtained, is Cambridge Gate (10 houses). The site of this Terrace was formerlyoccupied by the Colosseum, designed by Decimus Burton. When this building wasdemolished, the present Terrace was erected in 1876 in its place.   It has no
THE REMAINING TERRACES11. These decisions will deal with 153 houses out of a total of 374 houses in the Terraces around regent&apos;s  Park. The remaining 221 houses are at present occupied either by lessees for residential accommodation until dates ranging from1962 to 1969, or as offices by the Government. The larger of these Terraces areSussex Place and Cornwall, York and Chester Terraces (145 houses). In addition,there are 9 smaller Terraces containing 76 houses.12. We have already been approached by experienced developers asking whether they could be given an opportunity of trying to convert a Nash Terraceinto first-class accommodation on a commercial basis. We propose to give thesedevelopers every opportunity to consider the problem and to satisfy us that they can carry out this objective. Indeed, we are anxious to receive offers from otherexperienced developers, provided that they are advised by architects acceptable to us. As a result, it may be possible that, after large-scale conversions, all thebuildings facing regent&apos;s  Park will contain modern residential accommodation.To assist these conversions, we shall need latitude to use parts of the buildingsnot facing the Park for offices or other suitable uses. It is our intention to allow a period of at least one year to enable these and other experts to give us their advice on this very important matter. If we, and they, are successful, theseTerraces will be able to be preserved. If not, we must then give further urgentthought to their future.13. It has been suggested to us that we ought now to ask the Governmenteither to make a grant of a large sum of money for the preservation of the NashTerraces or to authorise us by statute to use our income for this purpose. Thetime, however, is not, in our view, ripe to ask for grants. We must first establishbeyond doubt whether or not the restoration of Nash Terraces in regent&apos;s  Parkcan be carried out without a large subsidy. It is our view that the Government,who are occupying as offices about half the main buildings, can now best helpby retaining them as offices for the necessary periods.Crown Estate Office, SWA,14th November, 1957.architectural merit. Next to Cambridge Gate is a single buliding now knownas Someries House. The original building was designed by Nash for an AdultOrphanage, but little remains of his design. It is now being used as government offices, and a temporary canteen building has been erected in the garden. TheGorell Committee not only recommended that this Terrace and this buildingcould be demolished, but that they should be. We propose to choose a skilleddeveloper, advised by an architect acceptable to us, to redevelop the sites inharmony with the surrounding Nash buildings and Terraces. We have taken thisdecision not only because the buildings are not worthy of preservation, but also because it is important, to discover how best modern buildings of really goodquality can be fitted into the Nash design. For this same reason we approved the impending erection of a new building for the Royal College of Obstetricians andGynaecologists, to a design by Mr. de Soissons, on the site between Sussex place and Hanover Terrace formerly occupied by Sussex Lodge, which has been demolished.Next to Cambridge Gate is Cambridge Terrace. This is a Nash Terrace,but the Gorell Committee thought it had the least merit of all, and should bedemolished. Four of its ten houses are gutted and only two are used as residences.We do not, therefore, rule out the possibility of including this Terrace later in the redevelopment scheme.
