C(57) 28526th November, 1957HEBRIDES ROCKET RANGEMemorandum by the Minister of defence proposal to set up a range in the Hebrides for Service trialsand training with guided weapons, was approved by the Defence Committeeon 13th July, 1955 (D.C.(55) 6th Meeting, Item 2).   The estimated cost ofthis scheme is about  18 millions (excluding the radar station on NorthUist, costing  2 millions).2,        Since then considerable reductions have been made in theweapon development and training programmes, following upon the changesin defence policy announced in the White Paper.   The Service departments and the Ministry of Supply have consequently re-examined their require-ments.   As a result, they have come to the conclusion that, subject tocertain acceptable limitations, the training facilities for air-to-air and surface-to-air weapons likely to be needed in the next five years or so,could be undertaken on the Welsh ranges of the Ministry of Supply atAberporth and of the War Office at Ty Croes.3. This would necessitate extending the Aberporth range out to seafrom 50,000 to 100,000 yea*e-and the Ty Croes range from 28,000 to3 5,000 yards; and certain additional facilities would have to be provided at these two ranges, costing about  21 millions.4.        There has not been time for the Welsh Office, the Ministry ofTransport and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to consult thevarious shipping, fishing and local interests concerned.   But, providedthat existing safety measures are maintained and safeguards are incor-porated in the missiles for breaking them up should they go off course,these Departments do not foresee any insuperable difficulties.5.        The Welsh ranges are, however, too small for Army trainingwith surface-to surface guided weapons, and it would still be necessary toprovide facilities for this in the Hebrides.   The   estimated cost is about 1. 8 millions, which includes  0. 6 million already spent or unavoidable(i.e. an additional expenditure of only about  1. 2 millions).6.        It will thus be seen that, if the use of the Hebrides range is limited to Army surface-to- surface weapons, and if training with air-to-air and surface-to-air weapons is carried out on the Welsh ranges, thecost of the whole scheme could be reduced from about  18 millions toabout  4. 3 millions.7.        I accordingly recommend -(a)   that the range facilities in the Hebrides should for thepresent be confined to those required for surface-to-surface guided weapons;COPY NOCABINET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE property  OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
(b) that Service trials and training with air-to-air and surface-to-air guided weapons shouldbe carried out on the Welsh ranges and thatthe necessary additional facilities should beprovided on them;(c) that an early announcement should be madeto Parliament.D.S.Ministry of Defence, S.W.I.25th November, 1957-2-SECRET
