secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1957C (57) 273 Copy No.15th November, 1957CABINETTHE SEVERN BRIDGEMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh AffairsThe Minister of Transport, with my support, has proposed that a start shallbe made on the Severn Bridge in the financial year 1960-61. The scheme, whichwill take several years to complete, will comprise the bridge structure and theimmediate approach roads. It will cost some  15^ millions, for which, I understand,room can be found within the total expenditure approved by the Treasury for theroads programme.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has stated, however, that he cannot agreethat this particular project should be included in the 1960-61 programme, on theground that it does not deserve a place in it.3. The Severn Bridge is such a burning issue in Wales that I must raise it with my colleagues. It is imperative in my view that a decision should be taken to buildthe bridge and to announce the decision now even though work on it cannot startfor 3 years. It will take at least 5 years to build the bridge, and the payments willbe spread over 8 years from the date of starting the work. ,4. Politically, public opinion in Wales is at present very disturbed. Myadvice to Parliament in July to pass the Liverpool Corporation Bill enabling Liver-pool to flood the Tryweryn Valley in Merioneth, while quite unavoidable, has aroused deep and widespread distrust of the Government^ attitude towards Wales.The recent sharp fear of unemployment in the Llanelly area as the result of the closing of old tinplate mills has produced a fresh and more justified feeling ofunsettlement. Truth to tell, many people in Wales are inclined to say just now thatthe Prime Minister may have chosen a well-intentioned man to be the new Ministerfor Welsh Affairs, but that ever since his appointment things have turned outbadly for Wales.5. A refusal to proceed with the Severn Bridge would, naturally, be contrastedin Wales with what is happening in other parts of Great Britain. The decision toproceed with the Forth Bridge is by no means forgotten. If it now became known that the Tyne Tunnel was to be approved, but that the Severn Bridge was still toremain out of the programme, it would inflame the belief in Wales that theGovernment refuses to give Wales a fair crack of the whip.6. There are economic arguments fully justifying the great importance whichWelsh opinion attaches to this bridge. The road approach to the South Walesindustrial area is, I believe, less adequate than for any comparable industrial area inthe United Kingdom. As the attached map illustrates, the worst defect is theabsence of a road crossing of the River Severn below Gloucester.7. The bridge would greatly improve communications between South wales and London and the whole of the South of England. It would transform the communications with the Bristol area. Bristol is 40 miles from Cardiff by raik90 by road.52605
8. South Wales has well over the national average of unemployment.Further industrial growth is needed to give stability, but it will depend on there being the necessary facilities, including proper communications.9. The existing road from Newport to Gloucester (the only road to Londonand Bristol) is at any rate in my view so twisty and narrow over much of itslength that, if the Severn Bridge were postponed, expensive road improvements which the bridge would render superfluous would have to be put in hand. Thiswould surely be a foolish way to spend money.10. For these reasons, I ask that the Severn Bridge should be in the roads programme for 1960-61, and that this decision should now be announced.H.
