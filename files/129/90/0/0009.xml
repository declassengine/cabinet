Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1957C. (57) 259 Copy No.4th November, 1957CABINETINTERNATIONAL LABOUR organisation memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service this memorandum discusses the action proposed on certain Conventions andRecommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference.I. Convention No. 105 concerning the Abolition of Forced Labour2. The Conference in June last adopted a Convention (No. 105) concerningthe abolition of forced labour whose main effect is to prohibit the use of forced labour as a means of political coercion or as a method of mobilising labour for economic development. Condemnation of these practices voiced in discussions ofthis subject which began ten years ago in the United Nations, followed by independent enquiry into their prevalence, has now culminated in this action bythe International Labour Organisation. The Convention, which was adopted bya practically unanimous vote, can be considered as among the most important ofthe International Labour Conventions.3. The full text of the Convention is appended (Annex I). It provides thatratifying Governments shall suppress immediately and not make use of any formof forced or compulsory labour as a means of political coercion or education or as a punishment for holding or expressing political views or views ideologicallyopposed to the established political, social, or economic system; as a method ofmobilising and using labour for purposes of economic development; as a means oflabour discipline; as a punishment for having participated in strikes; or as a meansof racial, social, national or religious discrimination.4. It was made clear, in the discussion of the Convention, that prison labour required of persons imprisoned for participation in illegal strikes was not to beregarded as &quot; forced or compulsory labour &quot; for the purposes of the Convention.5. The law and practice in the United Kingdom are fully in accordance withthe requirements of the Convention and I seek the concurrence of my colleagues ina decision to ratify it. It is desirable that the Convention should be ratified as soonas possible in order to deny, or at least minimise, the propaganda advantage whichmay be taken of early ratification by Soviet bloc countries.II.-(a) Convention No. 104 concerning the Abolition of Penal Sanctions for breaches of Contract of Employment by Indigenous Workers(b) Recommendation No. 100 concerning the Protection of Migrant Workersin Under-Developed Countries and Territories6. I also seek the concurrence of my colleagues in decisions concerning twoInstruments adopted by the International Labour Conference in 1955 Convention 104 concerning the Abolition of Penal Sanctions for Breaches of contract of Employment by Indigenous Workers and Recommendation No. 10052545CONFIDENTIALbTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
concerning the Protection of Migrant Workers in Under-Developed Countries and territories. The texts of these Instruments were presented to Parliament in cmd. 9629 published in November 1955.7. The United Kingdom is not directly affected by either of these twoInstruments, but both concern a number of the non-metropolitan territories forwhich the United Kingdom is responsible. After consultation with the Common-wealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretary, I propose, with their agreement, thatthe Convention should not be ratified, and that as regards the Recommendation itshould be stated that its basic principles are generally acceptable to the majority ofthe Governments of the non-metropolitan territories. Annex II gives a summaryof the provisions of the two Instruments and the reasons for the proposed decision.III. Recommendation No. 102 concerning Welfare Facilities for Workers8. I further ask for concurrence in a decision to accept a Recommendationadopted by the International Labour Conference in .1956, viz., RecommendationNo. 102 concerning Welfare Facilities for Workers. The text of theRecommendation was presented to Parliament in Cmnd. 36, published inDecember 1956. Annex III gives a summary of the provisions of theRecommendation and the reasons for accepting it, subject to certain reservations.9. Conventions of the International Labour Organisation are ratified by theUnited Kingdom Government on behalf of both Great Britain and NorthernIreland. The Minister of Labour in Northern Ireland has been consulted andconcurs in the present proposals.10. It is the practice to inform Parliament by means of a White Paper of theGovernments proposals on Conventions and Recommendations adopted by theInternational Labour Conference. If the present proposals are approved, authority is sought for the issue of a White Paper which would state briefly the action proposed and the reasons for it.I. M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,1st November, 1957.
ANNEX IText of Convention 105 Concerning the Abolition of Forced labour the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the InternationalLabour Office, and having met in its Fortieth Session on 5th June, 1957, andHaving considered the question of forced labour, which is the fourth item onthe agenda of the session, andHaving noted the provisions of the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, andHaving noted that the Slavery Convention, 1926, provides that all necessary measures shall be taken to prevent compulsory or forced labour from developinginto conditions analogous to slavery and that the Supplementary Convention onthe Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices Similarto Slavery, 1956, provides for the complete abolition of debt bondage and serfdom,andHaving noted that the Protection of Wages Convention, 1949, provides that wages shall be paid regularly and prohibits methods of payment which deprive the worker of a genuine possibility of terminating his employment, andHaving decided upon the adoption of further proposals with regard to theabolition of certain forms of forced or compulsory labour constituting a violation ofthe rights of man referred to in the Charter of the United Nations and enunciatedby the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international convention,adopts this twenty-fifth day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and fifty-seven the following Convention, which may be cited as the Abolition ofForced Labour Convention, 1957:Article each Member of the International Labour Organisation which ratifies thisConvention undertakes to suppress and not to make use of any form of forced or compulsory labour (a) as a means of political coercion or education or as a punishment for holding or expressing political views or views ideologically opposed tothe established political, social or economic system;(b) as a method of mobilising and using labour for purposes of economic development;(c) as a means of labour discipline;(d) as a punishment for having participated in strikes;(e) as a means of racial, social, national or religious discrimination.Article 2Each Member of the International Labour Organisation which ratifies thisConvention undertakes to take effective measures to secure the immediate and complete abolition of forced or compulsory labour as specified in Article 1 of thisConvention.Article 3The formal ratifications of this Convention shall be communicated to theDirector-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 41. This Convention shall be binding only upon those Members of theInternational Labour Organisation whose ratifications have been registered with theDirector-General.52545
2. It shall come into force twelve months after the date on which the ratifications of two Members have been registered with the Director-General.3. Thereafter, this Convention shall come into force for any Member twelvemonths after the date on which its ratification has been registered.Article 51. A Member which has ratified this Convention may denounce it after theexpiration of ten years from the date on which the Convention first comes intoforce, by an act communicated to the Director-General of the International LabourOffice for registration. Such denunciation shall not take effect until one year afterthe date on which it is registered.2. Each Member which has ratified this Convention and which does not,within the year following the expiration of the period of ten years mentioned inthe preceding paragraph, exercise the right of denunciation provided for in thisArticle, will be bound for another period of ten years and, thereafter, may denouncethis Convention at the expiration of each period of ten years under the termsprovided for in this Article.Article 61. The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall notify all members of the International Labour Organisation of the registration of all ratifications and denunciations communicated to him by the Members of theOrganisation.2.

Should the Conference adopt a new Convention revising this convention in whole or in part, then, unless the new Convention otherwise provides (a) the ratification by a Member of the new revising Convention shall ipso jureinvolve the immediate denunciation of this Convention, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 5 above, if and when the new revising convention shall have come into force;(b) as from the date when the new revising Convention comes into force thisConvention shall cease to be open to ratification by the Members.2. This Convention shall in any case remain in force in its actual form and content for those Members which have ratified it but have not ratified the revising convention.Article 10The English and French versions of the text of this Convention are equally authoritative.
ANNEX IIConvention No. 104 concerning the Abolition of Penal Sanctions for breaches of Contract of Employment by Indigenous WorkersThis Convention provides that the competent authority in each country wherethere exists any penal sanction for the breach of a contract of employment shall take measures to ensure the abolition of such sanctions within one year of ratifying the Convention.In the United Kingdom and the great majority of the non-metropolitan territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible, no penal sanctions for breaches of employment contracts exist. The Convention, therefore, has no practical application there.In the few territories where penal sanctions still exist, namely, SouthernRhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and the High Commission territories, it is not yetpossible to undertake that they will be abolished within one year.It is, therefore, proposed that the United Kingdom should not at presentratify this Convention.Recommendation No. 100 concerning the Protection of Migrant Workersin Under-Developed Countries and TerritoriesThis Recommendation which provides for the protection of migrant workers and their families during their outward and return journeys and duringemployment does not directly concern the United Kingdom. It does howeverconcern the non-metropolitan territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible. It has been brought to the attention of the Governments concerned and the basic principles of the Recommendation are generally acceptable to themajority of them in the light of existing law and practice.ANNEX IIIRecommendation No. 102 concerning Welfare Facilities for WorkersThis Recommendation lays down standards for the provision of feeding, restand recreation facilities in or near places of work, and for transport facilities toand from work where ordinary public transport is inadequate or impracticable. Itdoes not apply to workers in agriculture or in sea transport.The Recommendation indicates alternative methods for achieving the standards it lays down. It does not require the standards to be prescribedexclusively by laws and regulations, but contemplates that they may also beachieved by other means such as collective or other agreements between employersand workers. In examining the position in this country, therefore, regard has been paid not only to the relevant legislative provisions, but also to the general situation as it has developed by the provision of the appropriate facilities through the various other means permitted by the Recommendation. From this examination it appearsthat the broad objectives of the Recommendation have been achieved, and that itsprinciples can be generally accepted, subject to reservations on the following points,which need particularly to be mentioned:  (1) Paragraph 24 provides that the competent authority should consultworkers&apos; and employers&apos; organisations concerning the method ofadministration and the supervision of welfare facilities set up by virtueof national laws or regulations. Where legislative requirements exist in
this country, the obligation to provide welfare facilities is placed on the employer and it is left to him to decide how the facilities should beprovided and managed and to arrange for any consultation withrepresentatives of the workers. It is not proposed to change this policy,nor to require the Factory Inspectorate, which is responsible forenforcement of the relevant requirements, to consult either employers&apos;or workers&apos; organisations.(2) Paragraph 27 provides that where meals are made available to the workersby the employer or by caterers or contractors, prices should be reasonable and there should be no profit to the employer, but that any financial surplus resulting from the running of the canteen should bepaid into a special fund and used either to offset losses or to improve the facilities provided; where the facilities are provided under collective agreements or special agreements within undertakings, the special fundreferred to should be administered either by a joint body or by theworkers. There are practical difficulties about defining profit in thisparticular connection. Moreover, in this country it is preferred to leavethe parties concerned to decide for themselves how any canteen fundestablished by collective or special agreement should be managed,without the terms of the agreement being prescribed in advance. It isnot therefore proposed to accept this paragraph.(3) Paragraph 28 provides that workers should not be required to contribute towards the cost of welfare facilities they do not wish to use, and that where they have to pay for welfare facilities payment by instalments ordelay in payment should not be permitted. Except to the extent thatthe first of these matters may come within the prohibitions of the TruckActs or the Factories Acts they are not the subject of regulation in theUnited Kingdom, although they may be dealt with by voluntary arrangements, and it is not considered appropriate that the Governmentshould take any action in regard to them.It is proposed that the Recommendation should be accepted subject to theforegoing observations and subject to reservations on the particular points indicated above.
