(57) 29831st December, 1957CABINETDEFENCE ESTIMATES, 1958/59Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer recognise that the Minister of Defence has made veryconsiderable savings in defence expenditure as a result of the policyinstituted in his White Paper earlier this year.     But economic circumstances compel me to draw attention to certain other considera-tions which are relevant.2,     It was agreed by the Defence Committee last August that theprovisional target for the total defence expenditure in 1956/59 shouldbe  1,450 millions.    This figure seemed to me to be a fair but not a low one, having regard to the overriding need to keep government expenditure down to a minimum.    Nothing has happened since august to alter my view.     On the contrary, if economy in government expenditure was necessary then, it is even more necessary to-day.Our whole economic strategy depends upon our holding down the levelof Government expenditure on current account, of which a very substantial proportion goes of course on defence.3.      Moreover, the difficulties which we are encountering in obtain-ing support costs from Germany (from whom in the current year we are receiving  50 millions), and the very fact that costs have increased,make it all the more important that defence expenditure, now and in thefuture, should be at a lower level.   It is against this background thatthe Ministers suggestion for Defence Estimates for 1958/59 of 1,492 millions,  42 millions above the target figure, have to beconsidered.4.     I must first remind my colleagues that some  60 millions ofdefence expenditure is not, under the existing arrangements, includedin the conventional &quot;Defence Budget&quot; but regarded as ,fcivil&quot;.   Forinstance, the bulk of the provision for next year&apos;s programme ofmegaton experiments, amounting to some  15 millions or more, is not included in the &quot;Defence Budget&quot; at all.5.      There is then a gap of  42 millions between the Minister ofDefencefs minimum and my own maximum.   If this is to be bridged, anumber of possibilities seem worth examining.   First, there are the savings which should result from an early decision to run down fightercommando   Secondly, the total for inducements should be  2 8 millions
instead of  35 millions - and perhaps still less.   The provision for research and development by the Ministry of Supply should be reducedby, I suggest, another  10 millions.   And the Service departments should be asked to accept the detailed reductions which have alreadybeen discussed between themselves and the Treasury.6.      On &quot;inducements&quot;, I have made it clear in correspondence with the Minister of Defence that the size of the provision must dependon the total defence estimates not exceeding  1,450 millions.   Further,if inducements can be afforded at all, my view is that  28 millionsrather than  35 millions should suffice in 1958/59, and  30 millionsrather than  37 millions in a full year.   These amounts would fullyrestore the relativity established by the generous settlement of 1956between Service pay and civilian wages, whereas the higher figureproposed by the Minister of Defence includes a substantial &quot;betterment&quot;factor.   I think it would be wrong to incur substantial additionalexpenditures on &quot;betterment&quot; until the Grigg Committee have reported.7.      The proposed provision for research and development expenditure concerns me greatly.   It is more than we can afford nextyear;  in the future the cost may, it seems to me, become still moreintolerable.   I fear that we are overloading our resources in this field with defence work without being clear about our ability to carryout our programme satisfactorily or even our need to undertake somuch.   I am particularly concerned at the heavy expenditure proposed for a number of highly sophisticated weapons, some of which seem to insure against another weapon&apos;s failure, while others may be out-ofrdate soon after (if not before) they are available.   Despite our acceptance of the American ballistic missile, we seem to be planning the development of a number of deterrent weapons, costing some 200 millions quite apart from the cost of developing the nuclear war-heads, and all due to come into service by 1965/66 or earlier.   Ibelieve that there should be a full-scale re-appraisal of all our defence effort in the research and development field.8.      In conclusion, I believe that we can, and must ensure that defence expenditure next year is kept down to  1,450 millions.   Ifthe proposals I have sketched in paragraph 5 above cannot achieve this - and I believe they can - we should seek to make further savingsby reducing the &quot;inducements&quot; which it is proposed to offer.P TTreasury Chambers, S.W.1.31st December, 1957.-2
