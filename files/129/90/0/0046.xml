secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1957Copy No.C. (57) 29630th December, 1957CABINETCURRENT affairs memorandum by the Prime MinisterWe are faced at the present time by an unusually large number of difficult problems of varying importance. We must make every effort to get the broad termsof solutions settled before I leave. After that, I must depend upon the co-operationof my colleagues, under the leadership of the Lord Privy Seal, to grapple with them.I shall of course be in full communication all the time.2. Foreign Affairs(a) Russia. We have the whole problem of the Western attitude towardsRussia and the reply we are to make to the Russian peace offensive. Publicopinion at home is disturbed and confused. I shall try to do a broadcast before leaving which I hope may be helpful.(b) Cyprus. The Governor is returning for discussion with the foreign secretary, the Colonial Secretary and myself which I hope will take place on1st or 2nd January. We must try to fix a line of policy for the immediate future.(c) Support Costs. The recent rejection both of the Centurion Tank and ofthe Saunders Roe 177 Fighter are not very favourable signs. I had a private discussion with Chancellor Adenauer on the question of the cost of our troops inGermany and he promised to deal with the matter personally. I shall send him afurther message before I leave.
.2:,;,., . .   SECRET ^3. DefenceWe have the problem of the Defence Estimates which I hope to get settled ingeneral terms but there are special difficulties with regard to certain aspects of air defence on which we are still working, and on which we must reach a conclusiont without delay.4. Home Affairs(a) We have to try and get the Civil Estimates settled and the question of meeting the Chancellor^ needs for some economies to offset the large growth in theexpenditure which seems inevitable as a result of commitments and policies enteredinto long ago.(b) We have the question of the Report of the Tribunal on the so-called&quot; leak &quot; and its possible effects upon the future structure of the Bank of Englandand its relations with the Treasury.(c) Developments are bound to take place on the wages front, but our policyis fairly settled here and for the moment we can only watch and pray.5. Malta. While the policy of the Government is settled in principle, we do not yetknow what will be Mr. Mintoffs attitude to the constitutional proposals. We havethe delicate task of steering our Party opinion, which is certainly divided.6. Any one of these matters would have occupied the political field in theold days for a whole session. All of them involve big difficulties in handling, andpossibly legitimate divergencies of opinion in the Cabinet.7. The only conclusion I can draw from this picture is that we shall need ahigh degree of co-operation and loyalty to each other and to the main causes whichwe serve if we are to succeed.H. M.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,30th December, 1957.
