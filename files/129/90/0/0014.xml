secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1957C. (57) 264 Copy No. (11th November, 1957CABINETWAGES : COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND ARBITRATIONMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National ServiceNormal Methods of Wage DeterminationTerms and conditions of employment in this country are determined almostalways by industry itself through voluntary negotiations between employers and workers. There are 22 million workers in the country, of whom nearly 10 millionare members of trade unions. Although public attention concentrates on theactivities of a small number of the principal trade unions, there are in fact some700 unions that negotiate on wages matters. It is true that the wages of someworkers, particularly in commerce and the professions, are determined on an individual basis, but they are none the less influenced by the current trend ofsettlements reached between employers (or their organisations) and the trade unions.2.   Settlements of this kind may be reached by the parties in three ways:  (a) by voluntary negotiations covering single employers or, more commonly,employers in an industry associated together for the purpose, whoundertake to observe the wages agreement;(b) by joint industrial councils containing representatives only of employersand workers covering some well-organised industries. In the public sector Whitley Councils in Government Departments and the health services and national joint councils for local authority services and nationalised undertakings are the counterparts;(c) by statutory wage regulation through wage boards and councils whichconsist of representatives of employers and workers together withindependent members (including the chairman) appointed by theMinister of Labour or (Agricultural Wages Boards) by the Minister ofAgriculture and Secretary of State for Scotland covering certainless well-organised industries. To some extent the independent members act both as conciliators and as arbitrators since if theemployers&apos; and workers&apos; sides fail to agree after discussion, theindependent members will try to resolve the differences and finally havethe deciding vote in reaching a decision.3. The approximate number of workers corresponding broadly to categories(b) and (c) above are:  (b) Industries covered by Joint Industrial Councils         ... 4,500,000Central Government       ............... 1,100,000Local Government          ............... 1,500,000Nationalised Industries (including Health Service)      ... 2,500,000(c) Industries covered by Wages Councils and CateringWages Boards..................      3,000,000Agricultural Wages Boards        ............        750,000The remainder of the employed population (about 9 million) will also be coveredby voluntary arrangements, ranging from the direct employer-worker relationship to negotiations between employers&apos; organisations and trade unions on an industry-wide basis.52578b
Conciliation4. An officer of the Ministry of Labour does not formally intervene in any dispute on terms and conditions of employment until it is clear that the negotiating() ^ machinery available has been fully utilised and has not produced a settlement. Theconciliation officer&apos;s advice and assistance will, however, be available if required during the course of negotiations. His activities are unlikely to range into central and local government employments or those covered by Wages Boards andCouncils, and he is less concerned with nationalised industries and joint industrialcouncil industries than with the miscellaneous field described in 2 (a) above.Failure of Joint Negotiations5. When it becomes clear that no settlement can be reached by the partiesdirectly, or as the result of conciliation, the arbitration facilities provided by theState may become available. Exceptionally the Minister may consider that it isnecessary to inquire into the causes and circumstances of the dispute in which casehe appoints a formal Court of Inquiry or less formal Committee of investigation to do this and prepare a report. Both these methods are referred to below.Arbitration6. Provided the Minister is satisfied that existing machinery has been usedto the full extent there are available two main types of arbitration:  (a) Voluntary arbitration: in which both parties agree to go to arbitration,is usually provided by the Industrial Court (President, Sir John Forster)but arbitration by a special board or by a single independent person is available. Awards of these bodies are not legally binding but inpractice the parties agree at some time (usually beforehand) to acceptthe awards.(b) Arbitration at the wish of one party only: which is provided throughthe Industrial Disputes Order, 1951, by the Industrial Disputes Tribunal(Chairman, Lord Terrington). Under this procedure, provided certainrequirements are fulfilled, a dispute referred to the Minister by one ofthe parties must be referred by him to the Tribunal, whose awardbecomes part of the implied terms of contract between the employer(s)and workers concerned. The Industrial Disputes Order is dependenton Defence Regulations and will disappear with them. I am at presentin consultation with the Trades Union Congress and the british employers&apos;&apos; Confederation on the provision of &quot; compulsory&quot;arbitration on something like the Industrial Disputes Tribunal model.This would need legislation.7. During the five years up to the end of 1956, the Industrial Court issued280 awards and the Industrial Disputes Tribunal 857 awards. Of the 151 awards of the Industrial Disputes Tribunal in 1956, 28 were concerned with localauthorities and 19 with the health services, many of these of minor importance.The most considerable disputes dealt with were those in the building industry(1 million workers); local authorities (360,000 workers); cotton spinning (240,000workers). No other disputes involved more than 5,000 workers.8. With few exceptions all the nationalised industries have joint agreements for referring disputes to arbitration and for the form arbitration should take.Details of these arrangements are given in Appendix A.Arbitration arrangements for the Civil Service are given in Appendix B.9. At hearings of both the Industrial Court and the Industrial DisputesTribunal these bodies have one representative of employers and one of workers,but whereas the Industrial Court has also one independent member (the chairman),the Industrial Disputes Tribunal normally has three independent members(including the chairman). On the Industrial Court membership seldom varies;but for the Industrial Disputes Tribunal all the members, other than the chairman,are drawn from panels, so that the membership varies from hearing to hearing.All members of arbitration bodies set up under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919,and the Industrial Disputes Order, 1951, are appointed by the Minister of Labourand paid from public funds. Representatives of employers and workers are appointed after consultation with the British Employers&apos; Confederation and theTrades Union Congress but independent members are appointed without consultation with an outside body.
Courts of Inquiry10. A Court of Inquiry can be appointed by the Minister of Labour witnoutthe agreement of the parties, but in practice this is usually forthcoming. It isreserved for matters of major importance, where no agreed settlement seems possible even through arbitration, and when an unbiased and independentexamination of the facts is considered to be in the public interest. The membership of a Court of Inquiry follows the familiar pattern independent chairman andone representative each of employers and workers and it will usually consist ofpersons who are active members of arbitration bodies. The Court of Inquiry isnot specifically an instrument of conciliation or arbitration, though its findings orrecommendations usually form the basis for settlement in subsequent negotiations between the parties.Courts of Inquiry have been set up in the last few years as follows:  1954195519561957Concerneddirectlywith wages3222Concerned primarily with otherconsiderationsHow Wages Settlements are Reached11. The table following shows the composition of the addition to the weeklywage bill 1951-56 by methods of settlement:.

Settlements were finally reached directly by theparties or through arbitration.Role of a Conciliator12 The Conciliation Act 1896 required that a conciliator shall inquire into the causes and circumstances of the difference by communication with theparties and otherwise shall endeavour to bring about a settlement of thedifference &quot; His function is one of bringing the parties in dispute together so thatthey m , reach agreement, not to suggest what the basis of settlement should be.Role of an Arbitrator13. The arbitrator^ function, as expressed in legislation, is the settlement oftrade disputes. He has no rules for guidance and he is not required to give reasonsfor his findings. He has before him the statements and submissions of the parties and he bases his award on practical considerations, such as(1) The capacity of the employer(s) to pay;(2) The &quot; fairness &quot; of his award in relation to movements in wages, &amp;c, foe comparable groups of workers;(3) Movements in the cost of living;(4) Increasing productivity;(5) The prospect of his award resulting in a settlement.52578
Supplying Information to Arbitrators. 14. At present the Ministry of Labour do not supply information toarbitrators or to members of Wages Councils to assist them in their deliberations.The Ministry of Agriculture have for some years supplied the Agricultural wages board for England and Wales with factual data about wages and earnings inagriculture and industry and with particulars of Government statements oneconomic policy. This was supplied at the request of members; no similar requesthas come from the other bodies referred to.15. We should not underestimate the profound significance, to the tradeunion mind, of the Chancellors statement that &quot; those who arbitrate &quot; should take into account the country&apos;s economic position. It seems to us unanswerable that inan adjudication of wages the national interest should be considered, but to thetrade unionist concerned and to his leaders this generally appears as a direction to the tribunal or court and also to some extent as an irrelevance in an issue as towhether or not his pay claim should succeed.16. We have a tightrope to walk in regard to this matter of collective bargaining and arbitration and I suggest that the following conclusions are theright ones to draw:  1(1) We should stick firmly to our belief that the right place for pronouncementsby the Government on economic affairs in this country is the despatchbox in the House of Commons and also to our belief that everyone inthe country should as far as it lies within our power be made aware of what we think could happen if restraint is not shown.(2) We must try to make it clear not only that we have not got a national wages policy but that we neither intend to have one nor is it possibleto have one. We do not intend any attack on collective bargainingnor do we seek to interfere with arbitration. We should continue tomake it clear that the Government do not intend themselves to declineor to encourage others to decline arbitration awards. Indeed, farfrom our doctrines being an attack on arbitration, it would be a morevalid criticism to say we are relying too much on arbitration. For thenatural result of our policies is that more offers considered inadequateby the unions will be made and therefore more cases might go to arbitration.(3) We should make clear, as we did in the Economic Debate, that we arenot sending official advice to the arbitrators nor unofficially do we intend to warn them privately against the dangers of any particularclaim.I.

This Tribunal deals with questions affecting the emoluments,weekly hours of work and leave of classes of Civil Servants on which Governmentdepartments and recognised Associations of Civil Servants have failed to reach agreement by negotiation. The Tribunal consists of an independent Chairman,one member drawn from a Panel appointed by the Minister of Labour and national Service as representing the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the timebeing, and one member drawn from a Panel similarly appointed representingthe Staff Side of the National Whitley Council. This arbitration machinery doesnot apply to the &quot; Higher Civil Service &quot; for whom the Coleraine Committee maymake recommendations in respect of pay, &amp;c.For civil servants employed in Government Industrial Establishments matters in dispute are referred by joint agreement to the Industrial Court for settlement.
