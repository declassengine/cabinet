Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1957C. (57) 269 Copy No.26th November, 1957CABINETTRANSACTION OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESSNote by the Prime MinisterGovernments should from time to time review their methods of conductingtheir business. I have recently been considering this in the light of the growingcomplexity of the problems which confront a modern Government and the increasing burden on individual Ministers; and I have had from Lord Attlee thereport to which I referred in the Debate on the Address which, though it containsno revolutionary proposals, has at least served to stimulate thought. As a result I now put forward the following suggestions :  (i) Ministers in charge of Departments should seek to devolve on their junior ministers, particularly in connection with Parliament, responsibility fora defined range of Departmental work. They must of course ensurethat decisions of major policy remain in their own hands and that theywill be kept generally informed of all the activities of their Department for which they will continue to be ultimately accountable toParliament.(ii) Neither the Cabinet nor its Committees should be burdened with business which can properly be settled in direct consultation between theMinisters concerned.(iii) Cabinet Committees should be used to reduce the burden on the Cabinetby ensuring that, wherever possible, a decision is reached below Cabinetlevel or that, if an issue has to be submitted to Cabinet, it has been adequately discussed and prepared in advance.(iv) Brevity in memoranda for the Cabinet and Cabinet Committees isimportant, and constant vigilance is required to secure it.
(v) Ministers should seek to reduce the demands on their time and energywhich are made by the vast mass of material which they are requiredto read. They can do so by insisting on brevity in Departmentalminutes and correspondence.(vi) We should try gradually to establish new conventions which will reducethe time spent by Ministers in the routine social functions, and in meeting foreign visitors at airports. As a start, we might discontinue the practice by which Commonwealth visitors to London are met by a minister at the airport.(vii) Ministers could exercise a finer discretion in accepting invitations to publicfunctions. While it is important that Ministers should use suchopportunities to keep in touch with public opinion and to ensure thatthe Government^ policies are given adequate publicity, it is doubtfulwhether many functions need be graced by the attendance of, say,four Ministers, of whom three will constitute an audience for the fourth.Before accepting invitations to public functions where they are not expected to speak, Ministers should ascertain how many of their colleagues have been invited and intend to accept the invitation.&quot;:; h. m!10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,25th November, 1957.
