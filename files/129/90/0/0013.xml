i(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (57) 263 COPY NO.12th November, 1957CABINETHOUSE OF LORDS reform memorandum by the Lord Chancellor and theSecretary of State for Commonwealth relations on 15th October the Cabinet discussed the line which government speakers should take in the two-day debate in the House of Lords on Houseof Lords reform, and agreed that it would be preferable to adhere to our original intention to introduce a Bill strictly limited to the creation of life Peerages and that we ought not to appear to be envisaging any extensionof the hereditary principle (C.C.(57) 73rd Conclusions, Minute 6).    Inparticular, we were advised not to encourage the suggestion of providingfor the admission of hereditary Peeresses.2.     We had an interesting, well attended and, on the whole, asatisfactory debate.    Our proposals for life Peerages for men and womenproved generally acceptable to all shades of opinion in the House.    not unnaturally the most vociferous critics were those who thought that wehad not gone far enough and mainly for that reason the reception in some quarters was fairly tepid.    There was, however, little disposition tomake it a Party matter, notwithstanding that the Opposition refused to commit their Party in any way, save in their rejection of the hereditaryprinciple.    In the Debate on the Address in the Commons, Mr. Gaitskellalso refrained from committing his Party, doubting whether the Govern-ment proposals could be treated apart from the questions of the composition of the House of Lords as a whole and its existing powers.One or two Labour Peers (e. g. Lords Silkin and Lucas) speaking for themselves, recognised the practical necessities of the case, that is tosay, the need to recruit adequate numbers of Peers to do the ordinarywork of the House.3.     Apart from the criticism that we had not gone far enough, and theexpressions of dissent (not only on the Labour side) from the hereditaryprinciple, the main points of debate and possible future controversy aroseover the question of limitation of the numbers of life Peerages to be created annually or to be in existence at any one time, the reduction ofthe number of hereditary Peers to an extent which would cut out thebackwoodsmen, the payment of salaries and expenses, the renunciation of Peerages (both before and after succession) and hereditary Peeresses.^*     Limitation on numbers of life Peers.    There was no uniformity of view on this question.     Lord Teynham and other Independent UnionistPeers were in favour of limitation on the ground that a large influx of life Peers would destroy the character of the House:  Lord Samuel was against any limitation.-1-
5.      After discussing the question in the light of the debate, we have come to the conclusion that it would be undesirable to fetter the powerof the Crown in any way.    Apart from other considerations, thearguments against limitation of numbers are compelling on the score of convenience and simplicity.    In practice the demand for life Peers will vary from time to time and the Prime Minister&apos;s hands ought not to be tied.    If an annual limitation were to be imposed, special exceptions wouldin any event have to be made to enable the Prime Minister to bring upMinisters and ex-Ministers to the Lords and this would complicate aBill which is otherwise extremely simple.    Moreover, it is difficult inlogic to impose a limit on the number of life Feers while the number of hereditary Peers which may be created remains unlimited.6.      Reduction of the number of hereditary Peers.    A number of Peersincluding Lord Salisbury wish the Bill to include a limit on the number of hereditary Peers who may sit.    They would arrive at a number byelection or selection.7.      Lord Salisbury will pursue this as he argues that now that theSocialists have declared themselves against the hereditary system thereis nothing to lose by going for a comprehensive scheme of reform andin effect daring the Socialists to repeal it when they take office.    he does not believe that they would do it.8.      There can be no doubt that an imposed limit on hereditary peers would arouse the strongest feelings in our Party and we are sure thatthe best way to deal with the backwoodsmen is to try the proposals ofthe Swinton Committee which recommended that the House could grantleave of absence.    This, at the time, was supported by all the parties and came well out of the recent debate.9.      Payment.    This question received attention from many speakersand fears were genuinely expressed that, unless some better financial provision is made, it may still be difficult to get new blood into the House.At the same time there was general appreciation of the dilemma, namely,the impossibility of paying a salary to a large number of Peers in anunreformed House, and the unwillingness of a large section of opinion tosee a reformed House incorporating any considerable hereditary element.10.      Renunciation of Peerages.    Lords Attlee, Silkin and othersbacked this proposal and it received some support.    The Lord Chancellormade it clear that the Government regard this question as essentiallyone for the House of Commons.11.      Hereditary Peeresses.    There was a general, but not universal,welcome for the proposal to admit women as life Peers.    There was some backing for the admission of hereditary Peeresses, and the pressure for them might increase.12.     Conclusion.    We consider that the course of the debate as awhole confirms the wisdom of the Cabinefs decision not to oroceed atpresent beyond a simple life Peerages Bill.    Tho advocates of radicalreform are fairly numerous and will certainly work behind the scenesand during the passage of the Bill in an endeavour to get us to change our-2-
minds.     Moreover, there are a number who have &quot;injustices&quot; which they wish to see remedied.     It is clear that we shall get badly bogged unless we stick  irmly to the principle of the limited Bill.13.    We attach to this memorandum a copy of a Bill to permit thecreation of life Peerages for men and women without any limitation onnumbers.    If the Cabinet approve, the Lord Chancellor does not considerit appropriate or necessary for the Bill to be brought before the Legisla-tion Committee, of which he is Chairman.    He has arranged for copiesto be sent to the Attorney-General and the Lord Advocate.    We shall beseeing the Independent Unionist Peers again on 21st November and wesuggest that the Bill should be introduced in the House of Lordsimmediately thereafter.14.    We accordingly recommend -(1) that&apos;] in the light of the debate in the House of Lords,the Cabinet should adhere to its previous decisionto confine its legislation on House of lords reform in the current session to taking powerto create life Peerages for men and women;(2) that authority be given for the introduction of theattached Bill in the House of Lords.K.H.House of Lords, S.W.1.12th November, 1957.SECIRET
