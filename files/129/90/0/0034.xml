Thisproposal has already been considered and rejected by the Cabinet.2. The Debate on Welsh affairs in the House of Commons must take place before the Christmas recess. Before then I have to convey to the Council our decision on their recommendation that there should be a Secretary of State andalso to tell them what changes, if any, the Government propose to make in handling Welsh affairs. There is a growing feeling among Welsh people thattheir particular interests are not receiving the attention which they should andwe shall need to be specially careful and sympathetic in our handling of welsh affairs at the present time if we are to prevent the Welsh Nationalist movement from gaining ground. Our proposals, therefore, need careful presentation. I have with the Minister for Welsh Affairs been considering this topic under two mainheads: Ministerial responsibility and the devolution of administration.3. We have rejected the proposal that there should be a Secretary of state on the Scottish model.  With the Minister for Welsh Affairs I have examined the
possibility of changes which without going that length might improveadministration and demonstrate to the people of Wales the care that is taken tosafeguard their interests. As a result I propose to create a new office of Ministerof State for Welsh Affairs. I have it in mind that the holder of this office wouldbe in the House of Lords.4. In considering what further measures of administrative devolution canbe taken we must bear in mind that there can never be exact uniformity of practice in all the different Departments. I believe, however, that it is in this sphere thatwe can give most practical help to Wales and I think that we can usefully do morethan we are doing at present. I have asked the Ministers of Agriculture, transport and Education to consider what measures of devolution they can adopt in their departments. Preliminary consultations with them suggest that we shall be ableto make some satisfactory practical progress in this direction.5. When we have considered this matter, I have it in mind to see theChairman of the Council for Wales and Monmouthshire to explain our proposals to him. I will then send a detailed written reply to the Council. Finally I will,in answer to a Question in the House of Commons on 10th December, brieflyannounce the Governments plans.H. M.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,28th November, 1957.
