C.(5?) 2571st November, 1957RECRUITMENT FOR THE ARMED forces memorandum by the Minister of defence in our White Paper on future defence policy (Cmd. 124), weannounced that &quot;the Government have decided to plan on the basis thatthere would be no further call-up under the National Service Acts afterthe end of 1960&quot;; and that &quot;in order to encourage recruiting, theGovernment will seek to make life in the Services more attractive. &quot;2.      The Service Ministers and I have for the last six months beenintensively studying the recruitment problem, since, as we have emphasised from the first, it will be no easy task to obtain voluntaryrecruits in the numbers required.3.      We shall need over the next five years an average rate of recruitment of male other ranks of 36,000 a year (27,000 adults and,000 boys).   Figures for each Service are -	Men	Beys	TotalRoyal Navy	3,000	3,000	6,000Army	18,500	2,500	21,000Royal Air Force	5,500	3,500	9,00027,000 9,000       36,0004.      These are the numbeis needed to build up by 1962 all-regular forces of about 375,000.   Assuming an average length of service of abouteight years in the Army and about ten years in the Royal Navy and RoyalAir Force, the average entry needed to sustain those forces after 1962would be some 31,500 a year (22,500 adults and 9,000 boys) .   No greatdifficulty is expected in recruiting the number of boys needed; theproblem will be to obtain the adults, of whom we need 2$7000 a year, upto the end of 1962 and 22,500ayear thereafter.   If recruitment runs atan average annual rate between these two figures, the total regular strengthrequired can still be achieved, though two or three years later thanplanned.   Should this occur, it will have to be decided, in the light of thesituation at the time, whether it is acceptable for the forces to be temporarily under strength.   If not, some form of selective nationalservice will have to be introduced to bridge the remaining gap.COPY NO.CABINETSECRET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
5.      Since the new defence policy was announced in April 1957,recruiting of adult male other ranks for all three Services has been atan annual rate of about 35,000.   However, of this total figure, the annual rate of entry on long service engagements is no more than 10,000; therest represents entry on short engagements - three years for the Armyand three or four years for the Royal Air Force.   The figures for each service are as follows -Adult Male Other Ranks (annual rate)Long short service     ServiceTotalRoyal Navy 3,700 - 3,700Army 2,500       19,000       21,500Royal Air Force 3,500 6,500       10,0006.      Most of the men who enter upon short engagements do so as analternative to a two-year period of National Service, in order to obtainthe higher regular rates of pay and have no intention of making theircareer in the forces.   We do not know how many will re-engage for afurther period at the end of their term, but the average for the Army inthe past has been less than 10 per cent.   The three-year Army engage-ment was abolished last month, except for National Servicemen and forthe Guards and certain other units; and it is too soon to tell what increase this will produce in long-term engagements.   (For what it is worth, theexperience of two weeks in October suggests an annual rate of about10,00.0.)7.     Taking it all round it seems reasonable to say that we need anincrease of about 50 per cent if we are to secure regular forces of the planned  size by the end of 1962.   In a period of full employment and high civilian wages, this is obviously not going to be easy, but I do not regard it as by any means impossible, if we take the necessary measureswithout delay.8.      It will not be achieved by sudden and spectacular measures, but rather by a sustained effort over a period of years.   This should include,not only measures to improve material conditions, but also action toemphasise the continuing importance of the Armed Forces in the life ofthe nation.9.     The willingness of men and women to join the Services isinfluenced by a wide variety of factors - social, industrial and psycholo-psychological .   The relative weight to be attached to each of them in the conditionsof life today is hard to assess, and past experience gives us   little or noguidance.   The Service Ministers and I have, therefore, decided to setup a strong independent Committee to advise on the long-term measuresneeded to attract and retain sufficient men in the Forces.Sir James Grigg has agreed to act as chairman.10.   A study of this kind is bound to take time.   Meanwhile someinterim action must be taken to stimulate recruitment and to removecertain positive disincentives to re-engagement.   It is already sixmonths since we announced our intention of improving Serviceconditions, and any further delay will gravely prejudice future prospects.11.    The Service Ministers and I have, therefore, proposed to theTreasury certain improvements which we consider urgently necessary.These include an average increase in pay of about 13 per cent, which-2-SECRET
would do no more than roetore the balance between Service pay and civilian wages to what it was when the present Service rates were fixed in February 1956.   The increase would not be spread evenly overall ranks, but would be distributed in such a way as to make the maximumimpact on recruitment and re-engagement.   Other measures proposed are the removal of various disparities and anomalies in allowances,and improvements in uniforms and amenities.12. The combined cost of these proposals would be about 39 millions in 1958/59, made up as follows -PayAllowancesUniformsAmenities  millions23 11133913.    In addition, there is the problem of accommodation.Successive Service Ministers have had publicly to admit that many ofour barracks are deplorably substandard, and married quarters inade-quate.   We cannot expect to attract recruits and to retain men for longservice, unless we can show that we are tackling this problem withdetermination.   I estimate that this will mean spending some  10- 15millions a year.   Even so, it will take about ten years to complete theminimum programme.14.    I accordingly ask the Cabinet -(a) to take note of the present position;(b) to accept that, if our declared policy of ending NationalService is to succeed, action to stimulate regularrecruitment is urgently necessary; and(c) to agree in principle to the measures proposed inparagraphs 11 to 13 above.D.S.Ministry of Defence, S.W.I.31st October, 1957
