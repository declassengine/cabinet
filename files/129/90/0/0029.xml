Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1957C. (57) 279 Copy No.20th November, 1957CABINETCOMMISSION FOR TECHNICAL CO-OPERATION IN AFRICA SOUTHOF THE SAHARAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for the colonies on 31st July, 1952, the Cabinet &quot; asked the Foreign Secretary to give themearly notice of any new proposal to extend similar immunities and privileges toother international agencies&quot; C.C. (52) 75 Conclusions, Minute 6. We are accordingly bringing to the attention of the Cabinet a proposal to extend certainprivileges and immunities to the Commission for Technical Co-operation in africa south of the Sahara (C.C.T.A.).2. The Commission is an international organisation, with its Secretariat inLondon, which has been in effective.existence since 1950, and consists of Stateshaving interests in Africa. The present membership comprises the Governmentsof the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Portugal, the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland, and South Africa: the admission of Ghana and Liberia to membership will shortly be completed. It is also hoped that the Sudan and ethiopia will join. The organisation has already proved its usefulness in fosteringtechnical co-operation in many fields, but from the political point of view it also provides convenient machinery for Governments with direct responsibilities intropical Africa to discuss more general problems. And it is hoped that in future,with an expanding membership, it may serve to strengthen the links with the west of the newly-emerging African States. Considerable political importance is also attached to the Commission by other member Governments, notably those ofSouth Africa, Belgium and Portugal, who see in it an organisation which cancontrol international interest in Africa and channel it into useful activities.3. When the C.C.T.A. Agreement (Cmd. 9066) was originally drawn up it provided only that the Commission should have the legal capacity of a body corporate and made no provision for the grant of privileges or immunities. Havingregard to its increasing importance to member Governments, and to the scale of privileges and immunities which had been considered necessary for the efficient working of other international organisations, there has recently been increasing pressure in the Commission for comparable treatment. The other member governments have lent their general support and it has been clearly indicated thatif Her Majesty&apos;s Government do not accord the Commission and its staff more generous treatment than at present, we may be faced with a recommendation thatthe Secretariat should be transferred to Lisbon; where it is believed the portuguese government would be prepared to accord full diplomatic privileges. Such a movewould deprive the United Kingdom of the special influence which we are able to exert over the Commission on account of its presence in London. It might alsoimpair the standing of the Commission in the eyes of the African States whomistrust the Colonial policy of the Portuguese Government.4. At its Twelfth Session in March 1957 the Commission asked for the earlyviews of member Governments on the granting of privileges and immunities and adecision on the attitude of Her Majesty&apos;s Government is now needed.52616THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
5. The problem has been kept under continuous review by the working party on Privileges and Immunities in which the Foreign Office and Colonial office have advocated the grant of those privileges and immunities which are listed inthe attached appendix. The modest scale proposed would, it is thought, satisfy the Commission and other member Governments and constitute a reasonableminimum which would promote the efficient working of the organisation. Forthis reason, and those summarised in paragraphs 2 and 3 above, this scale was strongly advocated by the Foreign and Colonial Offices, who have in mind theimportance, at any reasonable cost, of ensuring that the Secretariat remains inLondon. The proposal has not however received the unanimous support of themembers of the Working Party. Of the other Departments particularly concerned,the Treasury and Board of Inland Revenue recognised the considerations ofpolitical expediency but were of the opinion that a case had not been made out on merits for extending privileges and immunities to the C.C.T.A. and that therewas little evidence that the Commission has yet been hindered in its operations by the fact that it does not enjoy these concessions. The proposed scale was,however, acceptable to the representatives of the Home Office and LordChancellor^ Office.6. In bringing this matter before the Cabinet we wish to point out that thescale of privileges and immunities proposed for C.C.T.A. is substantially lessgenerous than that conferred on the United Nations Specialised Agencies or indeedupon the majority of other international organisations; it does not include, forexample, the controversial &quot; personal&quot; immunity conferred upon certain highofficials of other organisations. In our opinion any international organisation ofthe character of C.C.T.A. with its seat in this country might reasonably expect tobe granted, to facilitate its work and interests, a scale of privileges approximatingto that, which is now proposed. It is, moreover, likely that this constitutes theminimum that will ensure that we retain the seat of C.C.T.A. in this country, withthe considerable political advantages which that entails.recommendation.   We accordingly invite the Cabinet to (a) approve in principle the grant to the C.C.T.A., its organs and its staff,the privileges and immunities which are set forth in the appendix tothis memorandum;(b) and, to this end, to authorise the opening of negotiations for the conclusionof a Protocol, or other appropriate amendments, to the C.C.T.A.Agreement.S. L.A. L.-B.19th November, 1957.APPENDIXPROPOSED SCALE OF PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES  FORTHE C.C.T.A.1.   For the Commission and its Organs (see Note 1)*(i) Immunity from suit and legal process v(see Note 2).*(ii) Inviolability of archives and premises.* (iii) Exemption from import taxes . and restrictions on the importation of official supplies.*(iv) Exemption from taxes and the non-beneficial portion of local rates,(v) Currency transfer facilities  of the kind granted to  certain  other international organisations. :2.   For the Secretary-General and other officers, and servants *(i) Immunity from -Suitin- respect-&apos; otfvoffipiall words- and actei ,*(ii) Exemption from income tax in respect of emoluments received from theorganisation (except-W the cdse- of Tocal nationals) (see Note 3).
(iii) Provision for staff and families to be allowed to import their personaleffects (including their furniture and a private motor-car) duty free,on the occasion of their first taking up duty in the country concerned.(iv) Exemption from immigration formalities and alien registration.In addition, Article X (6) of the C.C.T.A. Agreement should be strengthenedon the lines of Section 28 of the Specialised Agencies Convention (Cmd. 7673)which deals with the issue of visas &quot; as speedily as possible &quot; and &quot; facilities forspeedy travel.&quot; It is not considered necessary to propose the provision of anyspecial passport or laissez-passer, but if other member Governments press for suchan arrangement, some general clause could be included to encourage member governments where possible to issue such documents.3. For representatives of member Governments attending C.C.T.A. meetings(other than representatives of the United Kingdom) (i) Similar facilities to those mentioned in sub-paragraph (iv) of the preceding paragraph.*(ii) Immunity from suit in respect of official words and acts.It is not considered necessary to provide for similar facilities for observersand representatives of non-member Governments.Notes1. It is doubtful whether the Scientific Council for Africa South of the Saharaand the other C.C.T.A.-sponsored bodies mentioned in Article 1 of the C.C.T.A.Agreement can at present be considered to be &quot; organs &quot; of the C.C.T.A., and soto qualify for immunities and privileges under the International Organisations(Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950, but it may be possible to take action withinC.C.T.A. to remove this difficulty.  This will be for later consideration.2. The items marked with an asterisk in the above list are concessions whichwill need in due course to be the subject of an Order in Council made under the1950 Act.3. As salaries were determined with reference to tax liability, adjustmentsmay need to be made, e.g., by the institution within the Organisation of its own internal tax system.
