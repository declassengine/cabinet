It is issued for the personal use of............................................................TOP SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 261Sth November, 1957CABINETWAGESNote by the Prime MinisterAt their meeting on 7th November the Cabinet agreed that a short statement should be prepared defining the Government^ attitude towards wage claims, witha view to ensuring that Government speakers would give consistent answers to questions on this matter.The attached statement has been prepared for this purpose. I would ask mycolleagues, in considering it, to bear in mind the following points:  (a) It is not intended to serve as the basis of a speech. We should not ourselvesattempt to prolong public discussion of this question. But, in so faras it is necessary for Ministers to make public statements on this subject,they should be guided by the general considerations outlined in the-statement.(b) What the statement does not say is as important as what it does say. Theeconomic theory from which our policy derives is not simple and itcannot easily be explained in straightforward language which theman in the street can be relied upon to understand. Fundamentally,we rely on the working of a disinflationary policy through the economy as a whole to counter the effects of any unwarranted increase in personal52571TOP SECRET

But it is neither intellectuallyeasy nor politically attractive to explain in public that, if one industrygets away with too generous a wage increase, other industries may haveto foot the bill in terms of a smaller increase in pay or some discharge oflabour. Nor is it easy to explain that, if the total demand on the economy is to be kept within manageable limits, the non-productiveworkers have got to be &quot; carried &quot; by the productive workers and that,for this purpose, the latter must be content with rather smaller rewardsthan their own productivity would strictly justify.(c) For these reasons we should not allow ourselves to be drawn into discussingin detail the impact of our policy on individual industries or particularsectors of the economy, whether in terms of prices or the level ofemployment. We should equally refuse to indicate in advance theattitude which we might adopt to hypothetical wage claims in industriesover which we have some control, e.g., the nationalised industries. Itwould, indeed, be unprecedented and improper if we did so. We mustargue in terms of general principles. We must not let ourselves be driven into a corner and be compelled to define our policy towardsparticular industries and individual interests.(d) The most important of the general principles is simple namely that, while we have no intention of interfering with the established processes of collective bargaining and will continue to accept the awards ofarbitration tribunals, we shall refuse to create more money to financewage awards which are not matched by increased output. This is the cardinal proposition; and on this proposition we should rest.I have circulated this statement of principles for the personal information ofmembers of the Cabinet. It should not be communicated to any person outsidethe Government Service; and I would ask my colleagues to remember, in whateveruse they make of it, the importance of not attempting to elaborate the government&apos;s policy in public statements in any more detail than Government spokesmen have so far supplied. I am arranging for the more important statements already madeto be circulated; and these should be regarded as the basic material on which all government speakers should rely.H. M.
STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES ON WAGE CLAIMS(a) Where the Government is dealing with its own employees or with services which are financed by the State, the existing Whitley procedures and principleswill continue to apply. In considering any claims under these procedures theGovernment will apply the most stringent tests of what is justified under theprinciple of fair comparisons. If the result is disagreement and arbitration follows,the Government will accept the award. If the outcome of negotiations or ofarbitration means spending more money, that money must somehow or other be saved, either within the particular Vote or within general Government expenditure.(b) If arbitration takes place in a nationalised industry, such as the railways,the Government will not expect the Board to reject the arbitration award; but theywill expect the Board to meet the extra costs from its own resources.(c) The Government have no power to prevent private employers fromnegotiating with their employees such wage increases as they see fit to grant. Butthe restraint on demand which will be exerted by the Governments disinflationarypolicies will operate to prevent employers from passing on such increases in higher prices while maintaining their sales undiminished.TOP SECRET
