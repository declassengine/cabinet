(57) 26512th November, 1957CABINETCYPRUSMemorandum by the Minister of defence the Cabinet on 30th July, 1957 (C.C. (57) 59th Conclusions, Minute 2),invited me (i) to arrange for an examination of the possibility of establishing adequate control over the areas of territory indicated in the map annexed toC. (57) 178, other than the enclaves of Akrotiri-Episkopi and Dhekelia-Pergamos, by means of the acquisition of leases in perpetuity;(ii) in consultation with the Colonial Secretary, to arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the desirability of enlarging theDhekelia-Pergamos enclave to include the whole of the Cape Grecopeninsula south of Famagusta.Desirability of Securing Facilities by Means of Bases2.   The facilities outside the Akrotiri-Episkopi and Dhekelia-Pergamosenclaves which we require to retain are as follows:  (a) Nicosia Airfield to accommodate fighter and transport aircraft, and toprovide alternative airfield facilities;(b) Cape Greco and Cape Kormakiti for deployment of radar early warningfacilities;(c) Mount Troodos containing a radar homing beacon for R.A.F. aircraft;id) Heraklis containing the R.A.F. transmitting station covering normalR.A.F. signals and also the transmission to London of intelligenceintercepts by the Y stations at Ayios Nikolaos and Pergamos;(e) four small outposts providing search and rescue and meteorologicalservices;(f) Zyghi containing the Foreign Office medium wave transmitter now usedfor B.B.C. broadcasts to the Arabs;(g) SCANT &quot; STUDIO &quot;-(the site marked &quot; B &quot; near Athna on the mapattached to C. (57) 178) and SCANT transmitter (site &quot; B &quot; south ofLarnaca on the map) covering both overt and covert Foreign Officewireless activities;(h) Ayios Nikolaos containing the Army Y station, the R.A.F. messagecentre and the Army ordnance depot.3. It is essential that we should be able to continue to use these variousinstallations after the introduction of condominium to the same extent as we do now.4. Although for all practical purposes it would be possible to secure this bymeans of leases, I do not favour this course. Leases would depend on some formof agreement with the new Government of Cyprus and we know from experiencehow vulnerable such agreements are to unilateral renunciation. Our rights are less52583
liable to be disputed if we retain actual sovereignty. The only point of going forleases in preference to sovereignty would be to make the arrangement morepalatable to the Greek Government. But I doubt whether in fact leases would bemore palatable to the Greeks than our retention of sovereignty. The GreekGovernment would have to give their positive approval to a lease arrangement andthey might well find this more embarrassing than to be faced with a firm decisionon our part that in transferring Cyprus to the condominium we must retain certainsmall areas under our sovereignty.5. In the case of Nicosia airfield, we would naturally grant to the condominium all the facilities necessary to operate it for civil aircraft.Desirability of Extending Dhekelia-Pergamos Enclave6. If the Dhekelia-Pergamos enclave were to be extended to include thewhole of the South-East corner of the island, it would comprise a goodself-contained area and would have the advantage of incorporating in one enclaveDhekelia-Pergamos, Ayios Nikolaos, Cape Greco and SCANT &quot; STUDIO.&quot;7. But there would be serious disadvantages. Instead of the negligiblenumber of Greeks who would be included within the smaller Dhekelia-Pergamosenclave, there would be some 17,000 Greeks and eleven villages. The larger areacontains fertile land including valuable citrus plantations and market gardens. Theejection of the local population would be strongly resented; yet, if they were allowed to remain, they would create a considerable administrative problem.8. On balance, I am satisfied that the disadvantages of extending the Dhekelia-Pergamos enclave in the manner proposed would outweigh any possible advantages.conclusions .   My conclusions are that:  -id) The negotiation of leases would be less satisfactory to us and notnecessarily more acceptable to the Greek Government, than ourretention of sovereignty over these areas.(b) The local resentment and the administrative problems which the proposed extension of the Dhekelia-Pergamos enclave would cause would greatlyoutweigh the advantages.D.
