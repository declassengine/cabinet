secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  October 1957C. (57) 252 Copy No.30th October, 1957CABINETBRITANNIA aircraft memorandum by the Minister of power on 15th October the Cabinet invited a Committee of Ministers under my chairmanship to consider what further steps would be necessary and justified toensure the satisfactory development of the Britannia aircraft (C.C. (57) 73rdConclusions, Minute 2). Progress has been made in dealing with the immediate difficulties which have arisen, and our colleagues may wish to have a reporton the steps taken so far and the present position; but a final solution cannot yet be assumed. This is, therefore, essentially an interim report.2. Britannia Programme. The Bristol Aeroplane Company have a programme for the production of 83 Britannia aircraft (of both the medium and long-range versions). Of these 83 aircraft 15 (of the medium-range version) havealready been delivered to British Overseas Airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.) andare in daily service. The remaining 68 are of the long-range version and of these18 have been ordered by B.O.A.C. and 24 by the Ministry of Supply, while ordersfor all save 5 of the remainder of the programme have been placed by othercommercial air lines, of those aircraft which have already been ordered, the eventual sale of the 5 ordered by the American North East Airlines is, however,in doubt.3. The Troubles of the Britannia. This programme has been placed injeopardy as a result of icing troubles which have been found to affect the Proteusengine of the Britannia. Although the engine passed its tests for normal icingconditions with complete success, it was subsequently found to be susceptible intropical areas to certain icing conditions whose existence had not previously beensuspected. Teething troubles are inevitable in any aircraft which, like theBritannia, represent a marked advance on anything which has gone before.Unfortunately, however, the icing difficulties have occurred at the height of theproduction programme and have proved particularly intractable. They have,moreover, attracted much publicity. As a result the reputation of the Britanniahas suffered severely and BristoFs delivery programme has been set back.4. A further blow to confidence in the Britannia was struck by the additionalengine trouble recently experienced at Miami in the prototype of the long-rangeversion, although we were advised that a remedy for this particular trouble hadbeen found before the incident but had not been applied to the aircraft. The AirRegistration Board is satisfied with this remedy.5. The Issues at Stake. We have worked on the assumption that failure ofthe Britannia project and the collapse of the Bristol Aeroplane Company mustbe averted unless this objective could only be achieved at a wholly disproportionatecost. If the present engine troubles continue serious issues may arise, regardingthe Britannia&apos;s certificate of air worthiness, the extent to which B.O.A.C. arecontractually committed to taking the Britannias which they have ordered and,bound up with both these questions, the policy to be pursued by B.O.A.C andother customers.52504
The immediate financial difficulties of the Bristol Aeroplane Company donot seem insuperable. These are discussed in paragraph 7 below. But if,for any reason, production of the Britannia had to be discontinued, an investmentamounting to some  73 millions, of which some  26 millions would have beenprovided in this and previous years out of taxation, will be abandoned. Therewould also be a risk of unemployment for 30,000 work people, which wouldparticularly affect Northern Ireland.For B.O.A.C. the financial consequences of the difficulties to date havealready been serious: failure of the Britannia project or further extensive defermentof deliveries might have a catastrophic effect. The Corporation would probably not survive without subsidy which would need legislation. Quite apart frompayments to which the Corporation might or might not be found committed under their contract with the Bristol Aeroplane Company, they would be deprived ofthe equipment supremacy which they had hoped to achieve on the North atlantic and other routes during the period up to about 1960 before long-range jet civil aircraft come into operation, and would become gravely short of passenger capacityunless Her Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to sanction an additional capital investment in dollars large enough to make good the shortage. Faced with these problems, B.O.A.C. have already indicated that they could not afford to acceptfurther deliveries of Britannias unless they could be assured that the currenttroubles will be overcome in time for these aircraft to enter service on the north atlantic routes in the summer of 1958, and they have already expressed their desireto examine the possibility of acquiring alternative aircraft from dollar sources.6. Possible Solutions to the Icing Trouble. The intensive search for remediesfor the icing troubles which the Proteus engine has encountered is nowconcentrated in two directions. In the first place, work is in hand on a system ofmultiple ducts to reduce the obstructions which exist in the present single airintake. Associated with this, as a long-term measure, is a major redesign of theair intake of the engine. The multiple duct system may well be capable in itself of solving the present icing troubles. It should be fully tested by the end ofMarch 1958. In recent weeks, however, another and quicker solution has come insight. This involves the injection of high-speed air streams from the compressorinto those parts of the existing air intake system which are susceptible to iceaccumulation. Extensive ground testing has shown that there is every likelihood that this will be fully effective. Flight trials are due to be held towards the endof November and the results should be known by the middle of December. Ifsuccess is confirmed the necessary modification can easily be made of all new enginescoming forward from the end of 1957, and could subsequently be carried out on those engines both of the medium and long range which have already been delivered.In that event the problem of timing will be transformed and B.O.A.C.&apos;s deliveryrequirements met. The cost of the whole of this programme of further development if it had to be carried through to the end might be of the order oft\ million- l million, of which, however, not more than    million would relateto the period before 31st December, 1957. We consider that the issues at stakeare such that the whole of this programme should continue to be pressed forward.:but we should propose to re-examine towards the end of the year the need tocontinue with longer term development in the light of the result of the testing of the air jet system.7. The Bristol Aeroplane Company. The financial problem of the bristol aeroplane Company seems manageable in the longer term, provided that theexisting orders for Britannias stand and the icing troubles do not lead to thewithdrawal of a certificate of airworthiness. The Company claim that they canhold B.O.A.C. to their Britannia contract. The delay which has taken place inthe deliveries of these aircraft, together with the withholding of certain payments by B.O.A.C. on grounds of shortcomings in performance and delivery date, andthe suspension of the North East Airlines order, have however left Bristolsseriously short of liquid resources. If no special steps are taken the Company&apos;sbank overdraft (see the table in paragraph 10) is forecast to rise from  18 millions in October to nearly  22J millions in December as against the present limit of 18 millions set by Lloyd&apos;s Bank. The immediate financial problem as we see it,therefore, is how to tide the Company at least over the next two months pendingthe conclusion of the coming tests of the air jet system. If these are successful,the Company&apos;s shortage of liquid resources should be relieved.   If they fail, a
new situation will have been created which we shall have to consider at that stage. We have not thought it desirable at this stage to attempt an examinationof this eventuality, since it is impossible now to predict what developments mightby then have taken place in the continuing research on the main re-design of theProteus engine which we are proposing should continue.8. Immediate Action by the Government. There are three possible means ofrelieving the immediate financial difficulties of the Bristol Aeroplane Company.The first lies in anticipating certain Government expenditure. There are certainpayments in respect of flying trials, of down payments for Britannia aircraftalready on order for the Government, and of jig and tooling expenditure for theOlympus engine for the Vulcan aircraft, which could reasonably be authorised inthe ordinary course of events; and further help could be given by a deferment ofthe levy payments owing by Bristols to the Government in respect of theGovernment^ expenditure on the development of the Britannia. (Such defermentwould also settle a dispute between the Government and the Bristol company which might have involved litigation.) Upon the understanding that no commitment is created beyond the end of 1957, we have agreed that immediate action should be taken on these lines, and also that Government expenditure on development of the Britannia should be increased by the cost of testing the airjet system. These various arrangements should provide a relief of some 2 - 6 millions for Bristols at the end of December, together with the million fortesting referred to in paragraph 6. It is proposed, however, to make these arrangements conditional upon certain interest payments from Bristols and torequire that the development levy on future sales of engines should be raised incompensation for the increased Government expenditure on development.9. Action by B.O.A.C. The second source of financial assistance is B.O.A.C.The delay in deliveries of their Britannia aircraft and the present confidence crisishave caused the Corporation to hesitate before continuing to accept any more ofthese aircraft. But in the light of the latest report on the air jet system and onthe strength of an indication that it is the desire of the Government that steps should be taken to support the Britannia programme at this juncture, the Chairmanof B.O.A.C., has agreed to recommend to his Board that the Corporation shouldcontinue to accept further deliveries of Britannia aircraft up to the end of this year,pending the results of the tests of the air jet system, and should make certainpayments on account to the Bristol Aeroplane Company in respect of former flyingtrials and of the sums previously held over. These payments would be withoutprejudice to subsequent claims on both sides. The Chairman of B.O.A.C. has also agreed to recommend that the Corporation should open negotiations with theCompany regarding the possible acquisition for one of the Corporation^subsidiaries of three of the aircraft previously earmarked for the North EastAirlines, though these would not in fact be required before the autumn of 1958-59.Further assistance would be forthcoming if the Royal Air Force could make use ofthe remaining two North East Airline aircraft on hire.10. Resulting situation. The total effect of the financial measures to be takenby Her Majesty&apos;s Government and B.O.A.C. is set out in the following table.Forecast Overdraft1. Earlier forecast......2. Additional   payments   byHerMajesty&apos;s Government and defer-ment of levy payments ...3. Revised forecast4. Payments by B.O.A.C.......5. Revised forecastOctober18-0782-01316-065-720*15-345  millionsNovember19-5632-41417-149-590*16-559December22-7062-63120-075 :-525*19-550Note.-These payments decline because, whereas the forecast at line 1 assumed full payment inrespect of Britannias to be. delivered to B.O.A.C., during the rest of the year, B.O.A.C. proposeto continue to hold back payment of  65,000 in respect of each of the four aircraft concerned.
This shows that the BristoPs overdraft would be kept within the Bank&apos;s limit during october and November, but that it would exceed the limit in December unless asthe third possible expedient the Bank were ready to provide further facilities to theCompany. In present circumstances it would hardly be appropriate for any approach on this subject to be made by the Government; but the Bristol company are confident that the further support for the Britannia programme which willalready have been demonstrated by the Government and B.O.A.C., if the measuresoutlined above are put into effect, should enable the Company to find the necessaryadditional finance, provided that no impression is given that any decision has beentaken to suspend the Britannia programme.11. Conclusion. By the means set out above the position of the bristol aeroplane Company will be assured till the end of November, and should in factnot be in danger in December, in the course of which month the success or otherwise of the new air jet system will be known. We recommend that our Committee shouldstay in being throughout this period so that we can keep the situation under continuous review and report again to the Cabinet as it develops.M.Ministry of Power, S.W. 1,28th October, 1957.
