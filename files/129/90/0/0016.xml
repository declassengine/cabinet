KENYAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies on Sth November in Nairobi I make a statement to the Electedand Corporate Members of the Legislative Council of Kenya on new constitutional arrangements.   This statement is attached; it will be presented as a White Paper to Parliament on 14th November.2.     I negotiated for two weeks with the various groups of membersof the Legislative Council.   The position of the Africans was that theywould not discuss any other constitutional isssue until their claim forfifteen additional seats for communally elected African representatives had been accepted and the agreement implemented.   The position of the europeans was that they were ready to negotiate on all constitutional issues together but they attached particular importance to some built-insafeguards for the minority communities and implementation of theagreement reached between the groups in the Legislative Council lastyear for the creation of some additional seats to strengthen the non-Government side of the Legislative Council and to provide a place forsome Ministers who would draw their support from more than a singlecommunal constituency.   There were some Europeans who wished to insist on the implementation of this agreement before discussion on other issues.   The Asians were on the fence.3.      It became clear that, if I remained bound by the pledge in the1954 constitutional settlement not myself to initiate changes so long asthe constitutional arrangements remained workable, a situation ofdeadlock with growing bitterness would persist.   Some of the leadingEuropeans realised, as I did, that this would not be to anyone1 s advantage.The European and Asian Elected Ministers therefore decided to help meto declare the Constitution unworkable and resume the initiative by putting their resignations in the hands of the Governor.4.     In these circumstances I made the attached statement.   The main features of the settlement proposed are as follows -(a)  Six additional seats should be provided for African members to be elected by communal electorates from constituencies subsequently to be determined.   With the proposal that the two seats at present filled by Corporate Members should not remain beyond I960, this additionwill bring the African Elected Members into equality of communalrepresentation with the Europeans.CO?Y NO.!(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C0(57) 26613th November, 1957CABINET
SECRET - 86(b) The additional seats contemplated in last year&apos;s agreement should be twelve in number, four to be filled by Europeans, four by-Africans and four by Asians.   These seats should be filled throughelection by the whole Legislative Council sitting as an electoral college and voting by free and secret ballot.   They can, perhaps, best be described as inter-communal seats.   The number of such seats may beincreased during the next ten years but during that period the proportionsbetween the groups (and within the various divisions of the Asian group)should not be varied.   Any changes in the total number of such seatsand the method of filling them should be subject to the approval of theCouncil of State, which is also a feature of the proposals.(c) In any future expansion of the Legislative Council there willbe no additional seats based on election by purely communal electorates,(d) The two portfolios available to African Ministers will beincreased in importance and the European and Asian Ministers without portfolio will be given defined responsibilities.(e) In order to protect any one community against discriminatorylegislation harmful to its interests, there should be created a Council ofState with certain defined powers of delay, revision and reference.This would not be a standing second chamber but would be convened,rather like a Privy Council, when occasion arose for it to exercise its powers.5.      This solution has the merit from the African point of view ofincreasing their communal representation on a scale which is reasonable in relation to the demarcation of constituencies (on which I have yet tohave the Governor&apos;s final recommendation) and in relation to the other groups, since the Africans will now have as many Elected Members,either from communal constituencies or by indirect election by theLegislative Council, as the Europeans.   It also replaces the previousconstitutional arrangements known to and opposed by the Africans asthe &quot;Lyttelton Plan&quot;.6.      From the European point of view the settlement has the virtuesof placing a barrier on the creation of further purely communalconstituencies and closing the door to the racialist advance of Africannumbers.   It also creates an instrument with powers of revision, delay and reference to Her Majesty&apos;s Government, the Council of State, whichwill have within its functions the right to give advice, which the Secretaryof State must respect, on any subsequent changes in the numbers and methods of election to the non-communal seats.    This does not preclude the possibility of moving in future in the development of this type ofseat to a common roll, but such a move would nut at present meet witha welcome from any group in Kenya.   The settlement also maintainsthe numerical relationship of f*sur Europeans tw two Africans to twoAsians among the elected Ministers in the Council of Ministers, although these proportions are not frozen in the settlement.7. From the point of view of the Asians and Arabs, while they have gained no addibional communal seats, they have been as a group allottedinter-communal seats **n a basis of equality with the other two groups.
8.      There is, of course, provision that in all circumstances theGovernor will be able to maintain a Government majority in theLegislative Council.   This, taken with the statement which I made tothe Press before leaving Kenya, that I believe that for many years tocome it will be necessary for the Government of Kenya to include acertain number of official members and for ultimate control to remain with a Governor responsible to Ker Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom, should promote a feeling of stability and confidence inthe country which I am confident will be widely shared by responsibleAfricans as well as by the immigrant communities.9.      There are two matters of importance which remain to besettled.   The first is the method of nomination of candidates for election to the inter-communal seats.   The second is the composition, functions and powers of the Council of State.10.    I therefore recommend -(a) that I should be authorised, as I said in my statement, to confirm to the Governor as thedecision of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, theintention to initiate the constitutional changesdescribed in this paper;(b) that I should be authorised to determine, inconsultation with the Governor, the remainingissues referred to in paragraph 9 above.A.L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.1.12th November, 1957-3-SECRET
KENYAPROPOSALS FOR NEW CONSTITUTIONALAR R A NG EM ENT SThe following statement was made by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies at a meeting with the Elected and Corporate Membersof the Legislative Council held in Nairobi on 8th November, 1957 -&quot;(1)    I have had many talks with the various groups and with ministers on the constitutional position, in which I have done my utmost to create a situation in which local agreement was possible. I amgrateful for the many courtesies I have been shown, but I have reachedthe disappointing conclusion that local agreement is not in sight.Throughout these talks I have naturally been considering, in consultationwith Kis Excellency, the elements of what I would myself regard as afair and durable solution of current political problems.   In doing so Ihave attempted to form a judgment on what I could approve as legitimateaspirations and what I could sympathise with as justifiable anxieties.All this time it has been my earnest hope that my role would be that ofa conciliator and that I would succeed in bringing the various racestogether so that they could secure an agreement acceptable to all.   Butit was not to be.(?.)    So far I have been inhibited from taking an initiative in thismatter by the undertakings given by Her Majesty&apos;s Government at thetime of the wise settlement arranged by my predecessor in 1954.   Ihave consistently adhered to the view that I was bound by these under-takings and that, so long as the Government so constituted remainedworkable, all pledges given at that time must be honoured.   Neither Inor my predecessor have ever considered that the refusal of any oneracial group to abide by these arrangements would necessarily make them unworkable.   I have now however been informed that the threeEuropean Elected Ministers - the Minister for Agriculture and natural resources, the Minister for Local Government, Health and Housing, andthe European Minister without Fortfolio, who is a Member of the WarCouncil - and the two Asian Elected Ministers - the Minister for works and the Asian Minister without Portfolio - have reached the conclusionthat the present lack of effective understanding, if it persists for long,will not be to the advantage of Kenya.   They have therefore decidedthat the interests of Kenya would best be served by my being free totake the initiative.   For this purpose they have tendered their resigna-tions to His Excellency.   He has accepted these resignations but has asked the Ministers to continue in office until the new constitutional arrangements, which I shall outline in this statement, have been introduced.As a result of these resignations I am satisfied that the constitutional arrangements introduced by my predecessor have now become unworkable,and that in these circumstances, as he made clear at the time might happen, the position has reverted to what it was before the emergency and Her Majesty&apos;s Government are free to take such action as theythink fit.    You will find the actual words in paragraph 11 of the Annexureto the Colonial Office despatch of 15th April, 1954.   I have asked you tocome here to-day in order to tell you what I, as Secretary of State,intend to do in these circumstances.    I will, on my return to London and
with the authority of the Prime Minister and my other colleagues in her majesty&apos;s Government, confirm to His Excellency the decision I am nowconveying to you.(3)    I have decided, with His Excellency&apos;s agreement, to initiateconstitutional changes designed to meet the main needs, aspirationsand anxieties of the people of Kenya as a whole.   Before leaving for theUnited Kingdom I wish to give you a general outline of ruy intentions.These intentions are clear and definite.   Subject to Her 3viajesty&apos;pleasure I will arrange for them to be expressed subsequently in properconstitutional form, which will incorporate any consequential changes of detail.(4)    To deal first with the constitution of the Legislative Council.I recognise that on merits the African population is under-represented,in terms of members returned by a communal electorate, in relation toother groups.   I therefore intend to provide for the addition of sixsuch seats for the African population from constituencies to besubsequently determined.   It is also intended to provide for one seaton the Government benches to be filled by a nominated representativefr om the Northern Province, which so many of us still think of as theNorthern Frontier District.   It is a further intention that the two seatsat present filled by Corporate Members shall not remain beyond 1960.(5)     Proposals were made last year by all groups for the creation ofadditional seats to reduce the disparity between the Government and non-Government sides of the House and to provide a place in LegislativeCouncil for Ministers who draw support from more than one community.I intend in this connection to provide for the creation now of twelve suchseats, four to be filled by Europeans, four by Africans and four by Asians,of whom one shall be an Arab, one shall be an Asian Muslim, and twoIndians who are not Muslims.   These seats will be filled through electionby the whole Legislative Council sitting as an electoral college, voting byfree and secret ballot.   Methods of nominating candidates for election to these seats will be decided later.(6)    The number of such seats designed to provide representation notbased on a purely communal electorate may be increased during the next ten years, but during this period the proportions between and within the groups which I have indicated will not be varied.   In addition, any alteration in the total number of such seats, or in the method of fillingthem will be subject to the approval of the Council of State, to which i will refer later.(7)    These additional seats of all kinds may add considerably to thenon-Government side of the House.   Provision will be made to ensurethat His Excellency will at all times be able to appoint such numbers ofnominated members as will secure an adequate Government majority.(8)    In any future expansion of the Legislative Council there will beno additional seats based on election by purely communcal electorates.(9)    Once the extra African seats and the non-communal seats nowproposed have been filled two Ministers will be selected from the african members.   Of the two African Ministers one will hold the portfolio of housing and the other a portfolio which will include Adult Education and
Community Development.   The European and Asian Ministers without portfolio will be given defined responsibilities.   It will be seen thatthe total size of the Council of Ministers remains as fixed last year.   Itwill be fully large enough and I do not think that efficiency would be served by any further increase.(10)  The division of Ministerial offices as between members of thepublic service and unofficials will remain as at present, subject to theGovernor^ discretion to make adjustments in the burden of responsibility-lity carried by individual Ministers.   The portfolios of Finance andof Forest Development, Game and Fisheries may be filled from withinor without the public service.   Of the remaining Unofficial Ministersfour will be Europeans, two Africans and two Asians.   The position ofthe Adviser on Arab Affairs, who is entitled to participate in the Councilof Ministers, will remain unchanged.(11)  There will be not less than three, and not more than sixParliamentary Secretaries, whose office will be changed to that ofAssistant Minister.   It is the present intention that two of the AssistantMinisters will be African, one an Asian and one an Arab.(12)  If, in the opinion of the Governor, there is no suitable member ofthe Legislative Council who is willing to accept office as an UnofficialMinister or Assistant Minister, it will be open to the Governor, subjectto the instructions of Her Majesty, to appoint a suitable person,preferably but not necessarily of the race in question.   A person soappointed may be within or without the public service and, if not already a nominated member on the Government side of the Legislative Council,would be nominated to such membership.(13)  In order to protect any one community against discriminatorylegislation harmful to its interests, there will be created a Council ofState with certain defined powers of delay, revision and reference.   Ishall in consultation with my colleagues in Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand with His Excellency, determine the powers, functions and composition of the Council of State.   It will be convened whenever occasion arisesto exercise its functions.(14)  When the present constitution was introduced, my predecessoraddressed a despatch to the Governor, to which I have already referred.This despatch conveyed certain of Her Majesty&apos;s instructions and dealtalso with matters arising out of the policy laid down by my predecessor.In the same way I shall subsequently address a despatch to HisExcellency, dealing with any additional matters not covered by this statement which remain relevant to the changed conditions since 1954.(15)  These arrangements, taken as a whole, make many changes inthe existing Constitution introduced in 1954.   But an important feature ofthat Constitution, namely the presence of Elected Ministers on the Councilof Ministers, is preserved.(16)  I believe that these arrangements should command the support of responsible people of all communities.   I pray that they will give to thepeople of Kenya of all races an opportunity for constructive and co-operative endeavour and a long period of stability and peace.&quot;
