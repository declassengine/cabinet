CABINETTHE SEVERN BRIDGE AND THE RCADS programme memorandum by the Minister of Transport and civil AviationThere seems to be some misapprehension about the effect ofmy proposal that we should announce now a decision to go ahead in1960/61 with the scheme for the construction of the Severn 3ridge and its immediate approaches.2. The cost, which will be fully recovered by tolls, will be about 15-2&quot; millions.    But none of this expenditure will be incurred until1960/61, and none of it, therefore, will fall within the period covered bythe current review of capital expenditure.   In 1960/61 only Sij million will be expended and only  1 million in 1961/62 so that even in the period covered by the current four year roads programme ending in 1961/62the amount expended will be only  l^ millions in all.   This compares with expenditure of  120 millions in these two years for the roads pro-gramme as a whole.   The rest of the expenditure will be spread over afurther six years and will not exceed  3 millions in any one year.3. Whatever may be the feelings elsewhere there can be no doubtthat there is the strongest pressure for the scheme in industrial SouthWales and the West of England.   I am being continually pressed bothinside and outside the House of Commons and in my view a decisioncannot be postponed much longer without considerable political damage.For a scheme like this, which is necessarily spread over so many years,the only time when the Government will get any credit for it is when theannouncement is made that a decision has been taken to go ahead.   Thatis one reason why I feel that the Government should announce their decisions in the very near future.4. It seems to me that for schemes of this magnitude we must have some faith in the future or our critics will be quick to point out - withsome reason - that we ourselves have no faith in the ultimate success ofour ov/n policies.5. I must make it clear that apart altogether from the politicalexpediency of going forward with the scheme it is fully justified on itsown merits.   The Chancellor is right in saying that in earlier discussions with him about the road programme it was the understanding that the severn Bridge should not be included in the four year programme.   the sums in question were then  15^ millions (for the smaller scheme) or 33 million (for the complete scheme) from the current programme.copy N(0-1-(TH&apos;S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(57) 28323rd November, 1957
SECRET154Since then I have considered the matter further with the Minister for welsh Affairs and have locked again and its phasing and merits and Iam satisfied that the scheme consisting of the construction of the bridge and its immediate approach roads only (costing about  15^ millions) is entirely justified on economic grounds when phased out in this way.   nor can I accept the view that because we cannot in the foreseeable futurecarry ouh the entire scheme including the motorways to link the bridgemore easily with London and Birmingham, the scheme should not becarried out at all.   The bridge by itself linked to existing roads willmake an immense contribution to easing traffic problems in this area.6. The benefits will be mainly to industrial traffic from SouthWales to the South of England generally.   The bridge will reduce the distance from South Wales to London by about fifteen miles, and to bristol and the South West by some fifty miles.   One South Wales steel firmestimates that the saving on steel on a journey from Cardiff to South WestEngland will amount to 9s. 2d. a ton.   The annual savings for one largeorganisation operating a fleet of about 230 vehicles a day between SouthWales and London and South West England are estimated to be of theorder of  62,500 a year for operating costs alone, quite apart from time.So important is the facility to those who will make use of it that they are willing to pay for it themselves by means of tolls and the local authorities would be prepared to go ahead with the scheme themselves without anyExchequer assistance if they were permitted to do so.7. With regard to the last paragraph of the Chancellors paper(C.(57) 274), the road programme has been publicly announced and thePrime Minister has publicly stated that it will go ahead despite the cutsin capital expenditure.   This has been extremely well received inFarliament and by the public and the Press and I could not agree to any reduction in it now.   I must again make it plain that even this programme is in my view nothing like adequate to deal with congestion on the roads and the future growth of traffic.   It is merely the minimum that I am prepared to defend.H.W.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1.22nd November, 1957
