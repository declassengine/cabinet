Because of the number of tribunials organised on a basis  common to Great Britain as awhole a single Council (to he appointed jointly hy the LordChancellor and the Secretary of State for Scotland) with powerto set up a special Scottish panel is preferahle to twoCouncils.&quot;(2)   Chairmen of tribunals should he appointed hy theLord Chancellor (or alternatively in Scotland, hy the lord president of the Court of Session or the Lord Advocate).Members should he appointed hy the Council on Trihunals.Recommendations for appointment hy the Crown should be made hythe Lord Chancellor.

(Paragraph 57).!entirely accepted.    The Council should, however, confineits recommendations regarding remuneration to general terms.&quot;(7)   The present arrangements for providing clerks of tribunials should continue.    The duties of a clerk should be confined to secretarial work, the taking of notes of evidence,and advice on the tribunal&apos;s functions.

The Council should be asked toadvise on detailed application of the recommendation to debarthe clerk from retiring with the tribunal unless sent for.u(8)    The detailed procedure for each tribunal shouldbe designed to meet its particular circumstances and should be formulated by the Council on Tribunals in the light of thegeneral principles enunciated in this Report.    The aim shouldgenerally be to combine an orderly procedure with an informalatmosphere.    (Paragraphs 63-6U).&quot;Entirely accepted, Tlio Council on Tribunals will not he.the nale-mftlsing authority ** but will act in an a&amp;ttisoryteapacitjr in this matter.U(S)    Every care should be taken to ensure that the citizen is aware of and fully understands his right to applyto a tribunal.

(Paragraph 7k)*uEntirely accepted.-2-
&quot;(13) HeariiKB Before tribunals should be held in public,except in cases where:- (i)  considerations of public security-are involved;    (ii) intimate personal or financial circumstanceshave to be disclosed;    or (iii) the hearing is a preliminaryinvestigation of a case involving professional capacity andreputation,,     A tribunal concerned almost exclusively withany of these types of case should sit in private,,(Paragraphs 77-81).&quot;Substantially accepted.     The qualification is thathearings before the National Health Service Tribunal shouldcontinue to be in private (i,e. not only the &quot;preliminaryinvestigation&quot; by the appropriate Service Committee),&quot;(14) Consideration should be given to the conferment of absolute privilege on witnesses before tribunals, at any rate on those giving evidence on oath.      (Paragraph 82).;tSubstantially accepted.      It is agreed that swornwitnesses should have absolute privilege;    the conferment of privilege on other witnesses and on documentary evidenceshould be considered by the Council.&quot;(1&apos;5) The right to&quot;1 legal representation before tribunalsshould he curtailed only in the most exceptional circumstances,(Paragraph 8?)*&quot;Entirely acceptedg      In fact, it is proposed to go further and remove all restrictions on legal representationbefore tribunals.&quot;(16) The official scheme of legal aid should oe extendedat once to tribunals which are formal and expensive and to final appellate tribunals.     Any extension of the scheme tocover a wider range of proceedings in courts should be accompanied by an extension to other tribunals.      (Paragraph 89).Rejected.      The proposal to extend legal aid to certaintribunals must take its place in the queue of prior andcompeting claims for the extension of this service.w(i7) Tribunals should have power to administer the oath.Those most akin to courts of law&apos;should always take evidence on oath.     Others should not normally do so.      (Paragraph 91).&quot;Substantially accepted.     The qualification is that insome cases, for the sake of informality and simplicity, it maybe undesirable for the tribunal to have the power.      On this basis the recommendation should be referred to the Couneil.!;(18) Tribunals should have power to subpoena witnesses togive evidence or produce documents.      (Paragraph 92),&quot;Substantially accepted.      The Council should be invitedto. consider whether the power should rest with the tribunalor be exercisable only by the higher courts,&quot; (19) Parties should be free to question witnesses directly and not only through the chairman.      (Paragraph 93) *uEntirely accepted,-3&quot;
!i(20) -Present arrangements for the award of costs and payment of expenses of parties should be reviewed by theCouncil on Tribunals,      The general principles should bethat;- (i) a successful applicant should be given a reasonableallowance in respect of his expenses, including in some casesan allowance for the cost of legal representation;    (ii) an unsuccessful applicant should never have to pay any costs but before social service and most other tribunals should beentitled to the same reasonable allowance as the successfulapplicant.      In dispute between private parties^ however,the parties should bear their own expenses and costs, except at the appellate level or where a party has acted frivolouslyor vexatiously, when the tribunal should have power to order the unsuccessful party to pay a sum towards the other&apos;s costs and expenses,      (Paragraphs 9U*-96).i!-Reserved. The payment of applicants&apos; legal expenseswould lead to the excessive employment of lawyers and producedelay and undue formality, but the payment of legal expenses in cases taken to appeal by the Department concerned in orderto obtain a clarifying judgement on a point of principle willbe sympathetically considered. On this basis the recommendations should be remitted to the Council for advice.&quot; (21) Notwithstanding recommendation (20), no change should be madein the powers of the Lands Tribunal and the Transport Tribunal to award costs or in the power of the Minister of Labour and NationalService to pay allowances to parties or witnesses beforeRe-instatement Committees or the Umpire.      (Paragraph 97) *nEntirely accepted.&quot;(22) Decisions of tribunals should be reasoned and asfull as possible.      (Paragraph 98),&quot;Substantially accepted.      In some categories of case,as the Pranks Committee reeognised, reasons  cannot be formally stated.     Detailed consideration of the applicationof the recommendation should be referred to the Council.&apos;!(23) As soon as possible after the hearing a tribunal should send to the parties a written notice of decision, whichshould set out the decision itself, the findings of fact bythe tribunal, the reasons for the decision and the rights ofappeal against the decision.      (Paragraphs 99-iOQ).;&apos;Substantially accepted.      The qualification is that noted in connection with recommendation (22) above.&quot;(2U) Final appellate tribunals should publish selecteddecisions and circulate them to lower tribunals.(Paragraph 192).&apos;1Entirely accepted
CONFIDENTIAL o a64i!(25) There should be an appeal on fact, law and meritsfrom a tribunal of first instance to an appellate tribunal,except where the tribunal of first instance is exceptionallystrong and well qualified.      (paragraphs 105-106).&apos;&quot;Substantially accepted.     This recommendation, whichsubstantially reflects present practice, is accepted inprinciple but its application to particular cases requiresfurther consideration.&quot;(26) As a matter of general principle appeal shouldnot lie from a tribunal to a Minister.      (Paragraph 105).i;Entirely accepted.::(27) An appeal on a point of law should lie to thecourts from a tribunal decision, except from a decision ofthe National Insurance Commissioner, the Industrial InjuriesCommissioner or National Assistance Appeal Tribunals,      Themachinery for such appeals should be simple, cheap andexpeditious - and should be formulated in detail by theappropriate Rule Committees.     Decisions of the national insurance Commissioner   the Industrial Injuries Commissioneror National Assistance Appeal Tribunals should remain subjectto review by certiorari. &apos;     (Paragraphs 107-112).i!Substantially accepted.      (See note on recommendation(25) above).;:(28) No statute should contain words purporting tooust the remedies fay way of certiorari, prohibition andmandamus.      (Paragraph 117)&quot;Entirely accepted.u(29) The Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State forScotland, respectively, should be responsible for thestatutory action to give effect to recommendations of theCouncil on Tribunals for England and Wales and the Scottish Council.      (Paragraphs 131-132).i!Partly accepted.      The two qualifications are:-(i) existing rule-making powers should not in general betransferred to the Lord Chancellor because of the administrativeburden this would place on his Department;    and (ii) it wouldbe inappropriate for regulations on certain matters.(notably tribunal remuneration) to be made by theLord Chancellor rather than the departmental Minister.u(30) The main function of the Councils should be toadvise on the detailed application to the various tribunals of the general principles of constitution, organisation and procedure enunciated in this Report.      (Paragraph 133).&quot;Entirely accepted.)-15-*
!:(3*l) Any proposal to estaolish a new tribunal should,be referred to the Councils for their advice.(Paragraph 133).&quot;Substantially accepted.     Consultation v/ith theCouncil about future tribunals should not include thequestions whether a tribunal was to be established and what issues should be decided by the tribunal.&quot;(32) The Councils should have power to take evidence,and their reports should be published,      (Paragraph 133),&quot;Entirely accepted.i!(33) The Councils should comprise both lay and legallyqualified members, v/ith a lay majority.     The chairmenshould be salaried and need not be lawyers.      (Paragraph 13U).UEntirely accepted..PART B - PARTT5uL&amp;R&quot;^TRmuNfcLS&quot;(34) The general principles enunciated in Part ii should, unless otherwise stated, De applied to all tribunalswithin our terms of reference (exceot those mentioned inparagraphs h and 5 of Appendix II).&quot;    (Paragraph 135).&quot;Substantially accepted.      This recommendation isclearly right in principle out the Government cannot commititself to complete acceptance.     A number of recommendationshave to oe referred to the Council for advice on their particular apiplication, and it will clearly take the Councilsome time to review the constitution and working ofthe many tribunals within their purview,;i(35) Whenever it is proposed to establish a newtribunal consideration should first oe given to thepossibility of vesting the jurisdiction in an existingtribunal,      (Paragraph 139).&quot;Entirely accepted.&apos;!(36) The adjudicating functi ons now 02c ercised by county Agricultural Executive Committees should be entrusted to new independent tribunals from which appeal should lie toan Agricultural Land Tribunal .or to the Scottish Land Court.(Paragraph 12+8),&quot;Reserved.     This recommendation (and recommendations37-39 below) Is being considered in the wider context ofthe review&apos; of the Agriculture Acts now taking place,i:(37) All chairmen of these new tribunals should havelegal qualifications and be wholly independent of the areaconcerned.      (Paragraph 1h9)*,iReserved.      (See note on recommendation (36) above),!!(38) These ^&apos;ib&quot;un^s^^h^uj2&quot;have the right, cm givingdue notice, to inspect the land.      (Paragraph 150),&quot;Reserved.      (see note on recommendation (36) above).-5-*
6b&quot; (39) -A proposal to make a supervision order should heheard by one of the new tribunals, and an appeal should lie toan Agricultural Land Tribunal or to the Scottish Land Courtagainst approval of the making of an order.      (Paragraph 152),i!Reserved.      (See note on reoommendation (36) above).&quot;(l+O) The numbers of representatives of local authorities on Local Valuation Courts in England and Wales should bereduced.      Persons acting as chairmen should be independent of any local authority   and members of local authorities shouldnot hear any case relating to property within the electoralarea which they represent on the local authority or within the electoral area in which they live.      (Paragraphs 155-156).&apos;&quot;Partly accepted.      The idea behind this recommendation isacceptaole in principle but it is unlikely that any substantial reduction in the number of representatives of local authorities,serving either as chairmen or members of these tribunals, canbe achieved in practice.     The local authorities concerned willbe asked to comply as far as possible with this part of therecommendation.     The Council of Tribunals should be invitedto keep under review the progress made in implementing it,.The terms of the proposal to oar local authority members fromhearing certain types of case appear to go wider than thePranks Committee really intended, and this matter requiresfurther consideration.r&apos;(hl) All chairmen of Rent Tribunals should have legalqualifications.      (Paragraph 1o3)*&apos;,!Substantially accepted.      Legally qualified chairmen arebeing appointed in most cases, but it is not proposed to dismiss competent lay Chairmen.;;(U2) The panels from -which Rent Tribunals are constitutedshould inslude valuers to serve when required.      (Paragraph 163).;Partly accepted.      The contribution which valuers could make is now limited, especially in view of the curtailment of the jurisdiction of Rent Tribunals by the Rent Act, 1957?particularly in England and Wales.&quot;(U3) An appeal should lie from a Rent Tribunal to anappellate tribunal consisting of a County Court judge or sheriff,sitting with a valuer as assessor.      (Paragraphs 165-160).&apos;&apos;Substantially accepted.     An appeal will be provided butthe detailed machinery requires consideration.i:(L[i(.) Legal representation should be permitted before aNational Insurance Local Tribunal when the chairman considersthat the claimant cannot satisfactorily present his caseunless allowed to employ a lawyer.      (Paragraph 17h).;iSuperseded, This recommendation is superseded by thedecision to remove all restrictions on legal representationbefore tribunals.
&quot;(1+5) National Insurance Local Tribunals should sit in public except v/hen a case involves the disclosure ofintimate personal or financial circumstances.      (Paragraph. 175).&apos;Entirely accepted.      This is a consequential of recommendation (&quot;13)*;; (1+6) In both national insurance and industrial injuriescasesall parties should have an automatic right of appealto the approrpiate Commissioner.      (Paragraph 177)* i:Entirely accepted.&quot;(i+7) National Assistance Appeal Tribunals should continueto sit in private.      (Paragraph 180).;entirely accepted.      This is a consequential of .recommendation (13)*&quot;(i+S) Legal representation before National AssistanceAppeal Tribunals should be permitted on the same basis as that recommended for National Insurance Local Tribunals -see recommendation (kk) above.      (Paragraph 183). :iSuperseded.      See note on recommendation (2+1+).&quot;(2+9) The functions of Family Allowance Referees shouldbe transferred to National Insurance Local Tribunals,  withappeal to the National Insurance Commissioner,    (Paragraph 181]Entirely accepted.      Some matters of detail will require futher consideration.:i(50) Appeals from the Medical Practices Committee shouldcontinue to lie to the Minister.      The general recommendations in Part II should not be strictly applied to this Committeebecause of its special character.      (Paragraph 193)* !entirely accepted.&quot;(51) Complaints against practitioners should continueto oe first heard b; Service Committees and decided thereafterby Executive Councils, suoject to further appeal.(Paragraphs 192, 19U).WEntirely accepted.,: (52) Service Committees should continue to sit in private.      (Paragraph 195).uEntirely, accepted.-8-
!1(53)  Service Committees should normally administer the oath,      (Paragraph -196),&quot;Entirely accepted,&apos;&apos;(5h) Complainants should be entitled to apply forthe assistance of an official representative at hearingsbefore Service Committees,    Clerks to Executive councils should continue to assist complainants in preparing theirstatements of case,      (Paragraph 200),;:Partly, apceptedb.     The last part is acceptable.     Thefirst part has still to oe considered in the light of thedecision to permit legal representation before thesetribunals, out any such official representation should beprovided by Executive Councils and not the HealthDeparments,&quot;(55) Ihe general recommendations in Part II should notbe strictly applied to Executive Councils, which areprincipally administrative bodies,      (Paragraph 201),&quot;Entirely accepted.-9.
&quot;(56)    The National Health Service Tribunal should in generalsit in public.    (Paragraph 203).&apos;Rejected.    The Tribunal1s jurisdiction is confined to national Health Service practice.    Only the DisciplinaryCommittee of the General Medical Council can debar apractitioner from all practice and since this Committee sitsin public there is no need for the National Health ServiceTribunal to do so.1!(57)    The right of appeal from the National Health ServiceTribunal to the Minister should be abolished, and the right ofappeal from Executive Councils to the Minister in certain cases should be replaced by a right of appeal to the Tribunal.    Asa safeguard for practitioners appeals by individual complainantsshould be heard by the Tribunal in private.    (Paragraphs 205-207).:..Partly accepted.    The first point, the abolition of appeal from the Tribunal to the Minister is accepted.    The last point,that certain appeals should be heard in private, is covered bythe rejection of recommendation (56).    The remaining point thatthe appellate jurisdiction of the Minister in minor disciplinarycases is reserved for discussion with professional associations,u(58)   Hearings before Military Service (Hardship) committees should be in public unless intimate personal or financial circumstances have to be disclosed.    Legal representation shouldbe permitted, and there should &quot;be an automatic right of appealto the Umpire, at least on any point of law.    (Paragraphs 214-216)Substantially accented.    The qualification is that somerestriction will be miaintained in appeals to the Umpire inhardship cases not involving points of law, in order to avoidan excessive number of appeals.&quot;(59)    It is particularly important that the general recommendations in Part II concerning the atmosphere of tribunalhearings and the publication of selected appellate decisions should be applied to Conscientious Objectors Tribunals;    an age-limit for members should also be considered.(Paragraphs 217-219).&quot;Entirely accented. The atmosphere of hearings is in thecontrol of the Tribunals themselves, and their attention willbe drawn to this point. The consideration of age-limits is amatter for reference to the Council.&quot;(60)   Pensions Appeal Tribunals should each include apractitioner with recent clinical experience as far as possibledirectly related to the disability in the case.    (Paragraph 221%&quot;Reserved.    There are practical difficulties to bediscussed with ex-Service organisations.&quot;(61)    We recommend no change in existing arrangements forappeals from the Licensing Authorities for Public Service and goods Vehicles.    Prom appeal decisions by the Minister a furtherappeal should lie to the courts on a point of law.(Paragraphs 229-231)&quot;Entirely accepted.-1 0-
&quot;(62)    The general recommendations in Part II should not he strictly applied to the Transport Tribunals.      (Paragraph 232).&quot;Entirely accepted.&quot;(63)    We have not examined the constitution and workingof the General and Special Commissioners of Income Tax, whichhave recently &quot;been examined fully hy the Royal Commission onthe Taxation of Profits and Income, hut it may he desirable toinclude the Commissioners within the terms of reference of theproposed Council on Trihunals.      (Paragraph 236).&quot;Entirely accepted.&quot;(6h.)    Compensation Appeal Trihunals should he strengthenedhy vesting the appointment of both chairmen and members in theLord Chancellor.     We donnot recommend the establishment of afurther appellate tribunal, but there should be an appealto the courts on a point of law.      (paragraphs 238-239).&quot;Substantially accepted.      The qualification is that members should continue to be appointed by the Minister of Labour,but in consultation with&quot;the Council on Tribunals.     This isconsequential on the general decision on the appointment ofmembers - see note on recommendation (2).&quot;(65)    The Council on Tribunals should consider the questionof providing a further appeal from the decisions of IndependentSchools Tribunals.      (Paragraph 2I4-I).&quot;Entirely accepted. The Council should be invited to do this in the light of experience gained from actual working ofthe Tribunals when they are set up.PART C - ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES  (GENERAL QUESTIONS)&quot;(66)    Although we confine ourselves to procedures relatingto land the broad principles enunciated in Part IV shouldordinarily be applied to other procedures clearly within thesecond part of our terms of reference.      (Paragraph 2h2).&quot;Reserved.      The application of the general principles toprocedures other than land procedures has not yet beenconsidered.&quot;(67)    An acquiring or planning authority should he required to make available, in good time, before the enquiry, a written statement giving full particulars of its case.(Paragraph 281).&quot;Substantially accepted.     The proposal in paragraph 281of the Report that this -requirement should be statutory is not acceptable.      To avoid the courts of appeal being able to enquire into the merits of the case the obligation should he tostate an adequate case and should he included in rules ofprocedure for enquiries to be made by the Lord Chancellor withthe advice of the Council on Tribunals.
H(68)   The deciding Minister should, whenever possible,make available before the enquiry a statement of the policyrelevant to the particular case, but should be free to direct that the statement be wholly or partly excluded from discussion at the enquiry.    (Paragraphs 287-288).&quot;Rejected   Not only do the dimensions of the problem in practical terms preclude acceptance but the issue of a policy-statement might seem to prejudge the case.    Steps will be taken,however, to make more generally known the policies which ministers are applying in these cases.H(69)   -If the policy changes after the enquiry the letterconveying the Minister&apos;s decision should explain the change and its relation to the decision.    (Paragraph 289).i:Entirely acceptedu(70)   The main body of inspectors in England and wales should be placed under the control of the Lord Chancellor,but inspectors may be kept in contact with policy develop-ments in the Departments responsible for enquiries.   Thepreference of certain Departments for independent inspectorsappointed ad hoc need not be disturbed.    If a corps ofinspectors is established for Scotland, the Lord Advocate should assume responsibility for it.    (Paragraphs 303-301].).&quot;Partly, accepted,.   The Minister of Housing must be able toexercise close control over his inspectorate because of the need to deal expeditiously with the large number of enquiries.   Whilsttransfer of the inspectorate to the Lord Chancellor is,therefore, impracticable, it is proposed that inspectors shouldhe appointed by the departmental Minister after consultationwith the Lord Chancellor and dismissed only with his consent.;!(71)   -The initiating authority, whether a Minister or alocal or other authority, should be required at the enquiry toexplain its proposals fully and support them by oral evidence.    (Paragraph 308).&quot;Substantially accepted.   As with recommendation (67) this requirement should be embodied in the rules of procedure.&quot;(72)    The code or codes of procedure for enquiries shouldbe formulated by the Council on Tribunals and made statutory;the procedure should be simple and inexpensive but orderly.(Paragraphs 310, 312).&quot;Entirely accepted..   The rules of procedure should be madeby the Lord Chancellor&apos; on the advice of the Council.&quot;(73)   In connection with the compulsory acquisition of land(and schemes which imply later acquisition), development plans-planning appeals and clearance schemes, a public enquiry shouldbe held in preference to a private hearing unless for special reasons the Minister otherwise decides.    (Paragraph 311 )*&quot;Entirely accepted.-12-
&quot;(7I4.)   The proceedings should he opened by t he&apos; init lat ingparty.   Strict rules of evidence are not required, hut the inspector should have power to administer the oath andsubpoena witnesses.   He should have a wide discretion incontrolling the proceedings and should give rulings on thescope of the proposed ministerial policy statements.(Paragraphs 31 2-313 ) .&quot;Substantially iaccepted.    The qualification is that, since it is proposed to reject recommendation (68) the need for the inspector to give rulings on the scope of the policy statementsdoes not arise.&quot;(75)   Officials of the Department of the deciding minister should be required to give evidence&apos; if the enquiry is into aproposal initiated by that Minister,   but not otherwise.Officials of other Departments should, if required, givefactual evidence in support of the views of their Departmentif these viev/s are referred to by a public authority in itsexplanatory written statement (see recommendation 67) or inits evidence at the enquiry,    (paragraphs 317-318).5:Substantlaity accepted..   The qualification is that officials of the Agriculture Departments should not be required to give evidence in cases where their Department has expressed no view on proposals to alienate agricultural land (see paragraph 319of the Report).!(76)   In compulsory acquisition cases and clearance schemesreasonable costs should generally be awarded to successfulobjectors directly interested in the land;   they should only be awarded to unsuccessful objectors if the initiating authority has acted unreasonably.   Costs should only be awarded against an unsuccessful objector if he has acted frivolously orvexatiously.   (Paragraph 323)*&quot;Reserved,,   it may be right to award costs more frequentlybut the question is not as straightforward as the PranksCommittee seemed to think.   The recommendations on costs require,further consideration in consultation with the Council,&quot;(77)   In planning appeals reasonable costs should generally be awarded to owner appellants if their appeals succeed or ifthe local planning authority has acted unreasonably.   Costsshould exceptionally be awarded to other successful appellants,(Paragraph 32U) ,!iReserved,: - see note on recommendation (76) above.&apos;&quot;(78)   Any award of costs should be made by the Minister.The inspector should hear submissions by the parties on costs and, where appropriate, made recommendations in his report.(Paragraph 325).&quot;Entirely; accepted, - but see note on recommendation (76)above.-13-
&quot;(79)   The Council on Tribunals should consider the basis on which &quot;reasonable costs&quot; should be assessed and keep underreview the arrangements regarding the award of costs,(Paragraph 32.6) i&apos;Entirely; accepted - see note on recommendation (76) above,&quot;(80)   Reports should be divided into two parts - (i) summaryof evidence, findings of fact and inferences of fact;   and(ii) reasoning from facts, including application of policy,and (normally) recommendations,    (Paragraph 328),&quot;Entirely accepted,.&quot;(81) The complete text of the report should accompany theMinisters letter of decision and also be available on requestcentrally and locally.    (Paragraph 3kh)*uEntirely accepted - but see note on recommendation (82)below.&quot;(82)   Additionally, if any of the following parties desiresan opportunity to propose corrections of faot, the first partof the report should, as soon as possible after the enquiry,be sent to - (i) the promoting authority (or local planning authority) and any other authority which gave evidence;   and(ii) all persons who lodged written objections (in planningappeals the applicants).   Recipients should be allowed fourteen days in which to propose corrections.   The inspector should decide whether to accept any proposed correction.    (Paragraph 3k$A!Reserved.   It is agreed that some opportunity for thecorrection of facts must be given but, because of practicaldifficulties, and the prospect of serious delay, an alternative means to that recommended must be devised.&quot;(83)   The deciding Minister should be required to submit to the parties concerned for their observations any factualevidence, including expert evidence, obtained after the enquiry.(Paragraph 350).&quot;Substantially accepted. The qualification is that &quot;expertevidence&quot; should not include technical or other advice given by civil servants.%&amp;h)   The Minister1 s letter of decision should set out infull his findings and inferences of fact and the reasons forthe decision.    (Paragraph 352),&quot;Entirely, accepted.&quot;(85)   The present special form of appeal to the courts inprocedures relating to   land should be retained and also appliedto decisions on planning appeals.   The time-limit for lodgingsuch appeals could be reduoed if recommendation (82) is accepted.    (Paragraph 359).&quot;Entirely, accepted,.-1U-
PART D - PARTICULAR ADJONISTRATIVE PROCEDURES.RELATING TO. LAND     &apos;   &apos;   ^       *&quot;&quot;(86)   Acquiring authorities should notify as early asossihle those likely to be affected by their proposals.Paragraph 367).&quot;Entirely accepted.&quot;(87)   Save in time of emergency or threat of emergency orIn special security cases the Service Departments should berequired to adopt the same procedure for acquiring land as other Departments.    (Paragraph 370).&quot;Partly accepted.   Two main considerations preventacceptance of the recommendation an it stands - (i) the urgency of some land requirements for defence purposes;   and(li) the need to avoid spotlighting the oases involvingsecurity considerations.   An alternative procedure is proposed,the main features of which would be that a statutory rightwould be given for a private hearing by a lawyer of standingappointed by the Lord Chancellor.   The inspector would have discretion to grant a public hearing in cases not involvingsecurity.   Because of the special nature of many of thesecases a number of other features of the normal procedure(notably the publication of the inspector&apos;s report) couldnot apply.&quot;(88)   Objectors should give advance written notice of proposals for alternative sites;   discussion of such sites at theenquiry should otherwise be disallowed.    (Paragraph 3/2).&quot;Entirely accepted,.   But safeguards for the owners of alternative sites will have to be devised If those sites areto be discussed, after due notice, at the enquiry.&quot;(89)   Compulsory purchase orders requiring confirmationshould be restvled &quot;draft compulsory purchase orders&quot;.(Paragraph 37k) *uEntirely accepted.&quot;(90)   The MlnTster^should pubUsh^any modifications whichhe proposes to make to a development plan, and twenty-one daysshould be allowed for the lodging of objections to them.Any further enquiry should be limited to opposed modifications.(Paragraph 377).&quot;Reserved.   The recommendation is equitable but would add considerably to the length of time required to reach decisions on these plans.   It requires further consideration.&quot;(91)   An appeal should lie to the courts on a point oflaw against a determination by the Minister as to whatconstitutes &quot;development&quot;.    (Paragraph 381 ).&quot;Entirely accepted,.-15-
&quot;(92) Local planning authorities should discuss applica-tions with applicants.    (Paragraph 382).&quot;Entirely accepted.&quot;(93)   Owners and. others directly interested In the land should he informed of third party planning applications andallowed to state their views.   They should also he informed of the decision of the local planning authority and of thelodging of an appeal,    (Paragraph 38I4.),&quot;Entirely accepted.    Steps will he taken to meet as faras possible the practical difficulties,i:(9h)   The weight of planning appeal work falling upon theGovernment Departments concerned should he reduced bydelegating some decisions to inspectors.    (Paragraph 392).&quot;Rejected,.   But further consideration will he givento the possibility of setting up local tribunals to decidecertain cases.&quot;(95)   There should be an appeal to the Lands Tribunal(in Scotland to an independent arbitrator) against a decision by the Minister that a property is &quot;unfit&quot; or against a refusal by the Minister to sanction a &quot;well maintained&quot; payment,(Paragraph 399)Reserved.   The provision of an appeal against refusal of a &quot;well maintained&quot; payment will be further considered.   Theprovision of an appeal to a tribunal on &quot;unfitness&quot; is impracticable for two main reasons - (i) the fact of unfitnessmust be established before the Minister confirms the clearanceor compulsory purchase order;   and (ii) the criterion ofunfitness cannot be fully codified.-16-
