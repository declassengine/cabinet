Printed for the Cabinet. December 1957C. (57) 289 Copy No.3rd December, 1957CABINETSEVERN BRIDGE AND THE ROADS programme memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of housing and Local Government and Minister for Welsh Affairs and theMinister of Transport and Civil aviation the Prime Minister has asked us to circulate an agreed statement on what theexpenditure on the Severn Road Scheme would be and how it would be phasedover the next few years.2. The  15-5 millions scheme for the Severn Bridge includes the cost oflinking it with the trunk road between Bristol and Gloucester (and Birmingham)(A.38) On the English side, and with the Swansea-Cardiff-Gloucester Road (A.48)on the Welsh side. It is common ground that at some time in the future thebridge ought to be linked more directly with the main road to London (A.4) and,to the North, with the new motor road which will be constructed to link theRoss Spur with the Midlands. These further schemes for providing connectionsfor the bridge are estimated to cost an additional  20-V millions; once the decisionto construct the bridge was taken pressure to carry out this work would build up,although its place in the programme would depend on an estimation of its meritsat the time compared with other schemes (there should, of course, be some-consequential savings elsewhere, in so far as use of the bridge relieves existing roads,especially the Chepstow-Gloucester Road).3. The preparation of the scheme will take some time to complete. work could not start before 1960-61. The Ministry of Transport take the view that itwould take about five years to finish, but the actual payments would be spreadover about eight years. In detail, they estimate that the payments for the 15^ millions for the bridge would be 1960-61 .................. 0-51961-62*.................. 1 01962-63 .................. 1-51963-64 .................. 2-71964-65 .................. 2-81965-66 ....     ............... 2-71966-67 .................. 2-81967-68 .................. 1-5Total    .........      ......    15-5* Last year of the 4-year road programme.The above excludes any provision in respect of the  20^ millions for the furtherroad links. The Treasury feel that costs may in practice turn out higher thanestimated, and that the payments may be more concentrated as one cannot reckonon a large part of the cost of the bridge remaining unpaid when the bridge is completed.P.
