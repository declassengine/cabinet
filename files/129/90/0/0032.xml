Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1957Copy No.C. (57) 28220th November, 1957CABINETSUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES, 1957-58Note by the Chancellor of the ExchequerSupplementary Estimates are presented to Parliament in February, and I havebeen considering the provisional figures collected by the Treasury of the amounts which Departments expect to ask for. I must warn my colleagues that they showa formidable total.2. On the figures at present before me, it would seem that Governmentspending, in spite of the Prime Ministers Minute of 10th August, will have so faroutrun the existing Estimate provision that there will be the following consequences,which are as unwelcome presentationally as they are financially:  (i) Civil Supplementary Estimates will be the highest for 4 years.(ii) We shall run out of cash before the Supplementary Estimates can be votedand further Supply obtained from Parliament through the normalMarch Consolidated Fund Bill, because the excess spending will bemore than can be covered by the normal method, viz., temporaryrecourse to the Civil Contingencies Fund. This will force us to go toParliament immediately after the Christmas recess for a specialadditional Consolidated Fund Bill for the purpose (it will be said) ofbailing us out of our profligacy.3. I ask my colleagues to be rigorous in reducing, and if possible eliminating,Supplementary Estimates which are at present contemplated. They damage us. I ask them too to cut their Estimates for next year, so that, even if we have to presentsubstantial spring Supplementary Estimates, we shall at least be able to claim inour defence that we are achieving the maximum offset by pruning next year&apos;expenditure.P. T.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,20th November, 1957.52627
