Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1957C. (57) 291 Copy No.10th December, 1957CABINETMALTA : CONSTITUTIONAL development memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andLord Privy seal at our meeting on 14th November I was asked, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, the Colonial Secretary and the Law Officers, to examine in greater detail the legal and constitutional implications of the proposals inC. (57) 262 for constitutional-development in Malta. (C.C. (57) 80th Conclusions,Minute 4). This memorandum, in which these colleagues concur, reports the resultof this examination.2. We were advised by the Law Officers, a copy of whose memorandum is appended, that the proposals in C. (57) 262 in regard to the future status of malta and the proposed affirmations on status and on legislation by the United kingdom parliament were in some respects objectionable. The points they raised were discussed at a meeting with the Lord Chancellor on 2nd December, at which thefollowing changes in the proposals previously submitted were agreed:  (i) the second, short draft on the status of Malta (C. (57) 262, Annex C,Alternative II), the effect of which is to include Malta within the territories of the United Kingdom without altering the title of theUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, should beadopted, with the omission of sub-section (3);(ii) the first affirmation on the status of Malta and on representation at westminster should be retained in the body of the Bill, though onlythe principle and not the extent of such representation should beaffirmed. It was felt by some of us that the part of the first affirmationrelating to status should if possible be expressed in terms of the unionbeing for ever after. (The provision that there should be not less than three members for Westminster would be dealt with by amendmentof the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949, whichgoverns the representation of the constituent parts of the UnitedKingdom); and(iii) the second affirmation on legislation by the United Kingdom parliament should not be in the body of the Bill but should be placed in the preamble.3. It was also agreed at the meeting that I should circulate for considerationdrafts showing the lines along which these conclusions might be expressed. Theseare attached as Annexes A and B.4. Annex A contains draft clauses incorporating the first affirmation; theaffirmation relating to the status of Malta appears as sub-section (2) of the firstclause, and the affirmation on representation at Westminster is in sub-section (1)of the second clause. I ought to draw the attention of my colleagues to the apparentinconsistency between sub-sections (1) and (2) of the first clause if the words &quot; [andfor ever after] &quot; were to be included in which case integration would be &quot; for everafter,&quot; whereas sub-section (2) contemplates the possibility at any rate thatintegration might be terminated with the consent of the Maltese Parliament.52707b
5. Annex B contains alternative versions of the affirmation on the relationship between the Westminster Parliament and the Parliament of Malta. In Version Ithe whole affirmation is set out in a preamble to the Bill. Version II takes theform of a preamble, which refers to an Exchange of Despatches between the twoGovernments about the relationship between the Westminster Parliament and the parliament of Malta, together with a proposed Schedule to the Bill setting out theExchange of Despatches.6. I invite my colleagues to agree with the modified proposals summarised at (i) to (iii) in paragraph 2 above and to authorise the Colonial Secretary to resume negotiations with the Maltese Government on this basis. For this purpose it willalso be necessary to decide, in general terms and not in matters of drafting detail,whether we approve the draft contained in Annex A and which of the alternativeversions set out in Annex B we prefer.7. Two other points requiring decisions were raised in C. (57) 262. The firstdealt with the phasing of the Integration Bill. As explained in paragraph 2 ofC. (57) 262, the plan now is that the Bill, covering both representation and the newconstitution, will only come into effect after the Maltese General Election. Thequestion arises whether the Bill should be so framed that its provisions come intoeffect automatically on the passing of a resolution by the new Maltese parliament by whatever majority, even a single vote. The Maltese Government strongly press that the Bill should come into effect on the passing of a resolution. A decision onthis point is necessary.8. It was also proposed in C. (57) 262 that there should be an exchange of letters with the Maltese Government on the subject of equality of treatment of maltese citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. The wording of the letterproposed in paragraph 7 of C. (57) 262 has been revised in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary. It may need some further revision, but the colonial secretary seeks authority for an exchange of letters on the lines indicated.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,10th December, 1957.
SECRET &quot;3      172ANNEX A    .First.

Draft Schedule of Malta BillSCHEDULERelationship between the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the parliament of MaltaExchange of Despatches2. We recognise that it is in accordance with the constitutional position which Malta is to have as part of the United Kingdom that, after Malta has becomepart of the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom Parliament will not, unless atthe request of the Parliament of Malta, pass laws extending to Malta in relationto matters with respect to which the Parliament of Malta has power to make lawsexcept so far as the United Kingdom Parliament may judge it necessary for the fulfilment of the responsibilities of the United Kingdom Government for defence and external affairs and except with regard to the following subjects:  Merchant shippingCivil aviationCoinage, currency and legal tenderExchange control3. We also recognise that it is the wish of the Government of Malta that this letter should appear in the legislation passed to make Malta part of the UnitedKingdom.Second Affirmation: Note by the DraftsmanVersions I and II are intended to record a detailed and rigid rule which willbe observed by Parliament at Westminster. The details of the rule are, it isthought, just those which the Maltese delegation have accepted but, in additionto this general restriction on Westminster legislation, the delegation want to see rigid rule that the Westminster Parliament will not change the constitutional arrangements worked out under the Integration Act. The details of such a rulehave not yet been worked out and cannot, therefore, be set out in the draftpreambles.The main difference between Versions I and II is that Version II relies on an exchange of Despatches which could be scheduled to the Integration Act, asindicated in Version II, or, if preferred, summarised in the preamble itself.
APPENDIXMALTAMemorandum by the Attorney-general in paragraph 4 of C. (57) 262 the Colonial Secretary states that &quot; the Maltesehave maintained that the new constitutional arrangements must reflect equality of status for Malta and its people.&quot; He says (in paragraph 10) &quot; apart from thequestion of equality of status with the United Kingdom the Maltese government attach great importance to having an explicit provision in the Bill to make Maltapart of the United Kingdom.&quot; In paragraph 14 he recommends that &quot; the fullestand most explicit expression should be given in the new arrangements to Malta&apos;sequality of status with us.&quot;2. The provisions contemplated do not appear to me to give Malta and its people equality of status with us. That equality could be secured by Maltabecoming a Dominion. That is not contemplated. If Malta becomes part of theUnited Kingdom, it does not thereby secure equality of status with the UnitedKingdom. The two things are mutually inconsistent.3. It is suggested that &quot; as Malta must no longer be a Colony, a new statusis needed and Northern Ireland provides the closest analogy.&quot; If, however, theproposals are implemented the Maltese people will enjoy far greater control over their own affairs than not only the Scots and the Welsh but also the people ofNorthern Ireland.In the first place, whereas the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, providesthat the power of the United Kingdom Parliament to legislate for Northern Irelandshall remain &quot;unaffected and undiminished,&quot; it is proposed that the Billcontemplated should exclude legislation by the United Kingdom Parliament on matters within the Maltese Parliament^ competence without their consent.In the second place, Malta will possess a far greater degree of autonomy thanNorthern Ireland. It will be free to legislate over a far wider field. It will have greater executive power.For ease of reference I have set out in Annex I hereto the proposed powersof Malta and the powers of Northern Ireland.4. Malta will in future participate, through its representatives in the Houseof Commons, in the exercise, should occasion arise, of the power of the UnitedKingdom Parliament to legislate for Northern Ireland. The people of Maltawill however continue to be subject to the laws of Malta and future Acts ofParliament will not apply to Malta unless that is specially provided for. existing acts having effect as part of the law of Malta will be capable of amendment bythe Maltese Parliament where they deal with matters within the competence ofthat Parliament.5. Mr. Mintoff has been told that &quot; it is the reality of the constitutionalrelationship which will count and not any descriptive title.&quot; Apart from the realityof sending three representatives to the House of Commons, I must confess that, forthe reasons given in the preceding paragraph, I am unable to see any reality in theproposed integration. It is not even proposed to treat Malta as part of the UnitedKingdom vis-a-vis foreign States. It does not follow from integration that the maltese will receive equality of treatment with the inhabitants of these islands atthe hands of the Commonwealth countries.The Affirmations6. The proposal that the body of the Bill should contain the proposedaffirmations appears to me unnecessary and objectionable. One Parliamentcannot bind another Parliament and though there are precedents in the Statute of westminster and the Ireland Act, 1949, Section 1(2), for Parliament purporting soto do, it would in my view be wrong to add to these precedents unless it is absolutely essential and wholly unavoidable. We should seek to maintain the sovereign rightof the Parliament of the United Kingdom to legislate for the United Kingdom.Such affirmations in the body of the Bill imply a statutory limitation of that right.
7. With regard to the first affirmation, in my view it would be preferable tofollow the precedents of the Union with Scotland Act, 1706, and the Union withIreland Act, 1800, which recited the intention to integrate and enacted that theunion should be &quot; for ever after.&quot;I could not resist the inclusion of that part of the first affirmation whichcorresponds with Section 1(2) of the Ireland Act, 1949, but I do very stronglyobject to a provision which purports to secure that there will always, unless Maltaconsents to a change, be three Maltese Members of Parliament.The statutory provision in the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats)Act, 1949, that Scotland shall have not less than 71 Members, Wales not less than35 and Northern Ireland 12 can be altered by Parliament. It is not likely that itwill be. I really cannot see any ground for purporting to give Malta a prescriptiveright to three seats in perpetuity, a right which Scotland, Wales and NorthernIreland do not enjoy. Parliament should not appear to divest itself of control overthe membership of the House of Commons. Provision for membership of the commons should in my view be made by amendment of the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949.8. If it is essential to have something on the lines of the second affirmation,then it should be in the preamble. I do not understand why the Colonial Secretarysays &quot; there is no real parallel between the Statute of Westminster and thisaffirmation.&quot; To me they appear closely associated. The limitation on the sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament in the Statute of Westminster was appropriate as a limitation on the right to legislate for independent sovereign States.The limitation here proposed is a limitation of the rght of the United kingdom parliament to legislate for part of the United Kingdom.9. I do not know to what extent the Government are committed to recordingthese affirmations in a statutory form. An agreement to integrate and an assurancenot to intervene do not imply an undertaking to give statutory effect to theagreement and assurance.The Alternative Drafts(Annex C to C. (57) 262)10.   Of the two Alternatives I think the second is to be preferred.11. The words &quot;United Kingdom&quot; denote a political and geographicalentity. Merely expanding the meaning of the words &quot; United Kingdom &quot; does notalter the geographical situation nor, for the reasons I have given in paragraph 4of this memorandum, will it.be followed by substantial changes in the politicalentity.12. To avoid tampering with the Royal Style and Title Alternative I combinesthe new name of the United Kingdom with the express preservation of the existingRoyal Title. Alternative II does not alter the description of the United Kingdom;it retains the title of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Irelandwhile including Malta within its territories.Alternative I results in a discrepancy between the Royal Style and Title andthe territories of the^ United Kingdom. Alternative II avoids this discrepancy andis consequently in my opinion to be preferred. Under Alternative II the words&quot;United Kingdom&quot; will have a different meaning in Acts of Parliament beforeintegration from the meaning after integration.13. The presumption of law referred to in paragraph 3 of Alternative II isthat Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament, because they are Acts of that parliament, extend to the United Kingdom. Without paragraph 3 of Alternative II(or paragraph 5 of Alternative I.) the inclusion of Malta, in the United kingdom would mean that future Acts would be presumed to apply to the &quot;UnitedKingdom &quot; (including Malta).The object of paragraph 3 is to avoid this consequence,, as it is proposedto limit the power of the United Kingdom Parliament to legislate for Malta andas the United Kingdom Parliament is unlikely in practice often to legislate formaltality. It is also intended to avoid the necessity of express exclusion of Maltafrom future Acts of Parliament.&apos; Paragraph 5 of Alternative I achieves the same)
object by providing that despite the inclusion of Malta in the United Kingdom,Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom are not to apply to Malta unless Maltais expressly included.Northern Ireland is in practice either expressly included or expressly excludedunless the context makes the extent of the Act apparent without express reference.I feel this precedent should be followed.14. The effect of paragraph 5 of Alternative I and paragraph 3 of alternative II is that in the event of the United Kingdom Parliament wishing topass a law applying only to Great Britain, Northern Ireland and Malta there willhave to be express reference to &quot; the United Kingdom &quot; (i.e., the United Kingdomincluding Malta). In all other cases the legislation of the United kingdom parliament will have effect just as if Malta were not part of the United Kingdom.These paragraphs clearly reveal the absence of legal reality behind the proposal that Malta should become part of the United Kingdom and in my opinion theyshould therefore be omitted.15. I have shown this memorandum to the Lord Advocate, the solicitor-General and the Solicitor-General for Scotland, who have told me thatthey agree with it.R. E. M.-B.Law Officers&apos; Department, S.W. I,25th November, 1957.
