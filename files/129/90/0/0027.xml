(57) 14 of 9th January outlined the course proposed for reducing theUnited Kingdom commitment in Libya while continuing to preserve our essentialinterest and discharge pur Treaty obligations there. .   !The Future Commitment2. Our financial contribution to Libya in the current year is  4  millions,devoted to budgetary support and development aid. We wish to reduce this andto get the United States Government to cover the gap. We also want the UnitedStates Government to take over responsibility for equipping and training the Libyanarmed forces. And we are reducing the number of British forces stationed in Libya:United Kingdom Interests in Libya&apos; 3.  These were described in CP. (57) 14.. They are:-ihi      --. ; tii . &apos;; - rU .ii(a) to check Egyptian influence and to keep Libya within the Western orbit;(b) to maintain influence of King Idris and strengthen internal security;(c) to secure specific military, naval and air facilities.  .      .!The Libyan Political situation. Since the beginning of the year, there has been a slight movement against us with potentialities for a further worsening of the position. In May the PrimeMinister Ben Halim resigned, ostensibly at his own request but in fact because hehad made powerful enemies whom he couldino longer withstand. Under him the libyan Government was committed to a prb-Western line and his relations withthe Egyptians and the Russians were bad. He has been succeeded by a weak man who is himself, as are most of his colleagues, pro-Western, but whose Cabinet nowcontains pro-Egyptian&apos; elements,&quot; notably the Minister of Defence,&quot; who was previously Ambassador in Cairo. With a weak Government, the influence of theKing has become more important. King Idris remains firmly pro-British, but hehas reservations about the United States. He does not attend thoroughly to thedetails of Government, however, and his Household includes pro-Egyptian elements.These are behind the recent gift of armoured cars and arms from Egypt.. ;,&apos; &apos; &apos;;. 5.&apos;&apos;&quot; The effect of these changes is that there may be a greater tendency to turntowards Egypt if the West, and particularly the United Kingdom, is thought to beproviding inadequate help. 1 !;52657
The United States Position      ^ .      .&apos;.  !6. The United States Government are willing to take over the training andequipment of the Libyan Army and the necessary approach has been made jointly tothe Libyan Government: As regards the financial side the United States Governmenthave never agreed, despite continued pressure, to make good the balance betweenLibya&apos;s needs and the  1^ millions which we stated to be our maximum annual contribution for the next five years. In the context of the Prime Ministers visit to Washington I promised the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Dulles, tore-examine our figure though I held out no hope that we should be able, to increaseit. Mr. Dulles has now sent me a personal message pointing out the difficulty whichthe United States Administration has in making long-term financial commitmentsparticularly where, as in Libya, a deficit in the ordinary budget is involved. Hepoints out, quite rightly, that this absence of certainty and continuity is disturbingthe Libyans as well. In short he urges us to maintain our aid at its present level orfailing this at least to assume responsibility for supporting the ordinary budget asin the past, while the United States Government does its best to maintain anadequate level of economic development.7. I would recall the discussion in Cabinet on 15th January when it was agreedthat our commitments should be reduced to the minimum necessary to safeguard our essential needs in North Africa (C. (57) 1st Conclusions, Minute 2). Quite apartfrom the difficulty with the United States it seems very important that our cut in thesubsidy, the payment of which depends on a contractual obligation, does not drivethe Libyan Government to demand a review of the Treaty and a curtailment of ourstaging and over-flying rights.8. Tn. the circumstances I hope, that my colleagues will agree that our contribution will have to be increased and that we should so inform the UnitedStates Government. We should allow the latter to look after Libya&apos;s developmentneeds and devote the whole of our subsidy to the budget. It would have to be clearly understood, however, that we could not assume any responsibility for thebudget of the Libyan Army, let alone any other forces which the Libyans may try to persuade the Americans to give them, and&apos; that our contribution to the budgetwould.in any case be limited to a given figure, say  2^ to  3 millions.j 9. On this basis I should hope that the United States Government would agree^ despite their present reluctance, to the future level of aid to Libya being taken up jointly by our two Ambassadors with the Libyan Government. The latteralready know that there will have to be some reduction in our aid; and the basis ofthe joint approach would be that there should be. a tripartite examination of Libya&apos;sneeds, so that, with the facts before us, we can see how the United Kingdom and united States Governments could best meet those needs. During the initial fact-finding stage we would not quote to the Libyans any figures on our United Kingdomaidjjrcjo f,^f^W irdf/iiitH\y iwlrJ qi-o;!/.; h;;r. m-liq/Vj .\.-uh    h)Reduction and Redeployment o  Our Forces  .10. Our military forces will be down to two major units with a few supportingtroops by March 1958. I have agreed with my colleagues directly concerned thatfor reasons of administrative convenience these forces should be concentrated in Tripolitania leaving one company&apos;in Tbbruk to be near the King and to meethis desire that some troops should be left in Cyrenaica. r&apos; 11. To meet local political requirements, the forces in Tripolitania will haveto be stationed outside the capital andiit is proposed that they should be in barrackson the outskirts of Tripoli and at HomS.12. The Libyan Government have been informed of these moves and havebeen given a list of the premises and installations which we are prepared to give up(Annex). It is important that we should not go back on the undertakings thusgiven to the Libyan Goyernmenh,     &quot;Future of British Troops in Libya, 13; The Defence Committee on 13th November invited the Minister ofDefence, in consultation with me, to review the plans for reducing British forcesin Libya, which at present fix March 1959 as the planning date for final withdrawal
(D. (57) 9th Meeting, Item 2). I welcome this decision; and, pending action asdirected by the Committee, I would only mention the following considerations which tend to support the Committee &apos;s decision:  , ,(a) the King arid the Libyan Government are already worried about the effectof&apos;our reduction on their ability to maintain internal security.   The;prospect of our total withdrawal would have a marked effect on their confidence about keeping the country stable, and would pfay: into&quot; the-   :  hands of the pro-Egyptian elements;  -     &apos;       iiu *-...  *i (b) with the Libyan Government in this state of riiind there would be a serious danger to the staging and overflying rights which are of cardinal, importance for. the strategic, mobility of our smaller forces and forour communications with the Middle and Far East;,-U: iffv:.,:      ,   ,;.: ,, . (c) the Americans, who are by no means anxious to adopt (the major role in libya, have made it clear that they want us to keep.some troops thereuntil they have been able to strengthen the Libyan army.:&apos; At the rateof expansion which the Americans can contemplate, it will be sometime before the army is of value as an internal security force, i We mustbe frank about,our intentions with.the Americans,; . ., \The Libyan Army and the British Military Mission &apos;/14. On 22nd October, H.M. Ambassador informed!&apos; the Eibyan&apos; PrimeMinister that Her Majpsty&apos;s Government would have to give up responsibility fortraining the Libyan army and the United States Ambassador, who was presentsaid that his Government were prepared to take this on and tp provide thenecessary equipment. The immediate Libyan reaction Was non-committal, butI have secret information that they much dislike this development.and may returnto the charge. The King himself has also expressed regret arid has urged that theBritish Military Mission should continue in being. ;i15. Plans for the run-down of the British Military Mission worked out by its Commanding Officer with the Head of the newly-established american military Mission provide for a gradual reduction over the coming year, to becompleted by October 1958 when one Arabic-speaking officer would be left toassist the Americans. In view of the King&apos;s pressure on us, I think we should try to keep the British Military Mission at about its present strength for the nextfew years. It might continue as a separate Mission working in close co-operationwith the Americans, or as part of a joint Mission. It would take some time for american equipment to displace the existing British equipment and it is likely that for a few years considerable numbers of Libyan forces will be equipped with british arms. The Foreign Office and the War Office are discussing this and,subject to agreement, I propose to explore the question with the United StatesGovernment.Recommendations16.   My chief recommendations are, therefore:(i) we should handle the question of financial aid with the United StatesGovernment on the lines indicated above;(ii) we should adhere strictly to the programme for the evacuation of barracksgiven in the Annex;(iii) we should retain our remaining troops in Libya beyond March 1959 until further notice;(iv) we should maintain the British Military Mission for a few more yearsprovided we can make the necessary arrangements with the Americans..    *   S.
