I 167SECRET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)Ca(57) 2906th December, 1957CABINET;ofy no. jf-^jSTATUES OF SIR WALTER RALEIGHAND JAMES memorandum by the Minister of WorksA number of public spirited business men and companies havesubscribed the money necessary to erect in London a statue ofSir Walter Raleigh.   I have promised to find a site and Mr. William McMillanhas been commissioned to execute the statue.   I am of the opinion that themost suitable place for this statue is balancing George Washington in front of the National Gallery.2. It is, I think, important to give prominence to the links betweenthe United States and Britain, and Americans visiting London should seethat we honour those who have played a part in the foundation of the UnitedStates and perhaps particularly those whose careers may be regarded ascommon to the history of both countries.    I think it would be most suitablethat two such distinguished Virginians as Sir Waiter Raleigh andGeorge Washington should stand on opposite sides of the extrance to theNational Gallery.3. This would involve the removal of Grinling Gibbons&apos; statue ofJames II and I welcome this opportunity of removing it to a more suitableplace.   This fine statue was only put in front of the National Galleryafter the war as a temporary measure.    Previously the statue had stood in St. James&apos;s Park close to the Admiz-alty on the site now occupied bythe Citadel.   James II was a very distinguished naval commander and sea-man.   It is therefore appropriate that he should stand in navalsurroundings.   My first intention had been to put the statue in the middleof the courtyard in front of Admiralty House, but the First Lordregretfully came to the conclusion that there was not room if he is toprovide space for cars.   I also considered the Royal Hospital, Chelsea,of which James II was one of the three royal founders.4. My present proposal is that this statue should stand in front of the steps of the Queen&apos;s House at Greenwich.    (A photograph of this site is appended to this paper. )  Not only is Greenwich the centre of naval history and tradition, but the buildings are the finest example we retain of Stuartarchitecture.   The Queen&apos;s House, one of the few buildings known to be byInigo Jones, is surely the perfect architectural background to a statue byGrinling Gibbons.   The Queen!s House was built by Charles I forHenrietta Maria who occupied it in her husband&apos;s reign and again after therestoration of Charles II,   It is certain that James II frequently visited hismother while she was living there.   The fact that the house has beenturned into the Maritime Museum is an additional reason why my proposals is appropriate.-1-OS
5.        The Trustees of the National Gallery naturally do not wish to lose this statue.   In 1946 when the statue was placed where it now is,the Royal Fine Art Commission &quot;felt that a more suitable site might befound .... that the choice of a new site for the statue of James It should bdeferred until it is decided whether there is likely to be a statue erectedto Pepys, as it is felt that the two should be associated with theAdmiralty.   Further .... the public should be able to get close up to and see all round a statue of such merit and that it would not in effect balance the Washington statue&quot;.   The Royal Fine Art Commission have now changed their views and wish the statue to stay where it is in central london so that it can be seen by the multitudes.   They would prefer meto remove the statue of Washington, despite the fact that it is a replicaof a work by Houdon and was presented by the Commonwealth ofVirginia.   This suggestion seems to me to have nothing aesthetic,historical or sentimental to commend it.conclusion.        I propose -(i)  to put the statue of Raleigh in front of the national gallery, and(ii)  to put the statue of James II in front of the Queen&apos;house at Greenwich.7. If the Cabinet disagree with these proposals, I should suggestthat the latter statue be put. once more in St. James&apos;s Park on the grassto the west of the Citadel, or alternatively in the grounds of the RoyalHospital, Chelsea.A.H.E.M.Ministry of Works, SaE.l.5th December, 1957-2-
