17th December, 1957 COPY NO. y\CABINETTHE ELECTRICAL TRADES union memorandum by the Minister of Labour and national ServiceThere is a good deal of public interest in the recent reports ofthe affairs of the Electrics 1 Trades Union (E0T.U.) and my colleagues may wish to know how I see the position.2.        The allegations against the E0T.U. Executive Council fall into two categories -(a) manipulation of elections;(b) alterations of rules to strengthen the powers ofthe Executive Council against its members.3. Manipulation of elections has been alleged against the Executiveby anti-Communist members from the time the Communists gainedcontrol of the union in 1948,   As, however, the only authoritativeinvestigating body is the Executive itself it has never been possible tobring thesc allegations home.In the present case Mr. Cannon (an ex-Communist), was standingagainst Mr. Fraaer (a Communist) for the position of Executive Councilmember for the No. 9 Division (which covers S,W0 London, Surrey,Berkshire, Hampshire, the Isle of Wight and the Channel Islands).   his election would have been a severe blow to the Executive Council andthey took-steps to lobby a.gainst him with all their resources.   It isalleged that the Executive Council disallowed on insufficient grounds the returns from several of the known anti-Communist branches, inparticular the Mitcham Electronic Branch and the London StationEngineers No. 14 Branch.   The Executive Council have quoted detailed figures supporting their action in rejecting the returns from the Branchesand stated that even if all the votes from these two Branches had beencounted Mr. Frazer would still have been elected.   The representativesof the Branches concerned have not only challenged the figures quoted by the Executive Council but have alleged that irregularities occurred in other Branches which were pro-Communist and that these have notbeen investigated or disallowed by the Executive Council; they have alsoreiterated their view that on a fair count Mr. Cannon would have been returned.-1-SECIIETTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(57) 291-
SECRET &apos; g24.        The remedies open to the anti-Communist Party are -(i)     An appeal to the Executive Council against their decision.Under the rules the support of 10 per cent of the Branchesis required,   The Executive Council are required eitherto convene a special policy Conference or to take a ballot vote.(ii)     Mr. Cannon might appeal to the High Court for an injunction against the Executive Council alleging thatthey acted in contravention of the rules of the union.(ill)     The members could appeal to the Trades Union Congress(ToU.Cc) who, under their rule 13, have power to inter-vene in certain circumstances and in particular whenthe conduct of any affiliated organisation may beregarded as detrimental to the interests of the tradeunion movement.It is know/n that (i) and (ii) are under active consideration.   Thepossibility of an intervention by the T.U.C. cannot be entirely dismissedthough they would naturally be reluctant to intervene in the internal affairs of a single trade union.5. The new rules have not yet been published, but there is some reason for believing that they will have the effect of strengthening theExecutive Council*s position as against its members and also that theycontemplate some alteration of the election machinery.   On the otherhand, the alterations appear to have been reached constitutionally andseem unlikely to conflict v/ith the limited requirements for continuedregistration with the Registrar of Friendly Societies.   They could beappealed against by 10 per cent of the total branches of the union, as could any other decision of the Executive Council.conclusion.        There is little or no evidence of the truth of the variousallegations.   Indscd I would be fairly confident that everything done hasbeen within the rules.   But this does not dispose of the matter.   The rulethemselves have probably been unfairly and unevenly applied.(i)     The best solution of course is for the members of the union(if they will and if they can) to rally against the Communistleadership.   There is a chance that they will.   I feel inpresent circumstances we should do nothing and say nothingthat will hinder them from doing this.(ii)     If it transpires that the members themselves are unable toput matters right the T0U.C0 can and should take action underrule 13.   But I doubt if they will.(iii)     If neither the union members nor the T.U.C0 are willingor able tc find a remedy we must consider the possi-bilities of Government action,   I attach a brief note of
some of the suggestions which have been made.   All ofthem raise issues of great difficulty.   But we need notdecide yet whether, and if so how, to intervene.   I will of course bring the matter back to Cabinet if any decision is needed.I.M,nistry of Labour and national Service, S.W.I.16 th December, 1957
APPENDIXPOSSIBILITIES OF GOVERNMENT action under the Trade Union Act, 1871 there is power to make regulations governing; matters of procedure whereby trade unionsmay be registered, but fresh legislation would be needed to make it acondition of registration that e. g. election ballots should be held underindependent auspices.2. Legislation would also be needed if it were proposed to maketrade unions publicly accountable, rather  on the lines of the CompaniesActs, by extending the powers of the Registrar to enable him to institute an inquiry into the operation of the rules and also require more detailed information about the trade union&apos;s accounts, procedures for election and so on.   It is argued in favour of this proposal that the equivalent provisions under the Companies Act   exist for the benefitof shareholders and that similarly such provisions in respect of tradeunions would be for the protection of trade union members.   The tradeunion movement would not of course accept this argument.3. The main practical objection to proposals for dealing with thesituation by strengthening the powers of the Registrar is that withdrawalof registration alone would not be very effective.   It would only deprivea union of certain advantages (e. g. the investment income of a registered trade union is exempt from income tax in so far as it is applied to provident benefit;  on a change of trustees the property of a registered trade union vests automatically in the succeeding trusteeswithout any conveyance, transfer or assignment;  and a registered tradeunion may sue in its registered name).4. Withdrawal of registration would not prevent a trade union from continuing to function, nor deprive the union of the advantages conferred on trade unions (whether registered or not) by the Trade Unions Acts,e. g. the immunity from actions of tort conferred by Section 4(1) of theTrade Disputes Act, 1906,   Any proposal to increase the sanctionsfollowing on withdrawal of registration, e. g. by providing that only a registered union would have the protection of Section 4(1) of the TradeDisputes Act, 1906, would be an extremely explosive issue.5.        A suggestion was made in a Parliamentary Question to the PrimeMinister on 5th December (Hansard, Column 609) that a tribunal shouldbe appointed under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.   Thiswas rejected by the Prime Minister on the facts then before him and hesaid in reply to supplementaries that &quot;this is a matter which it is primarily the duty of the members of the union to cure, but for which other bodies have a responsibility which I feel sure they will not shirk&quot;.    Itwould, of course, be possible to appoint a committee under general powersbut such a body would have no power to compel witnesses or call fordocuments.16th December, 1957
