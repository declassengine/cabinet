CABINETADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALS AND ENQUIRIESNote by the Lord chancellor the summary of the findings of the Ministerial Committee on administrative tribunals on each of the 95 Recommendations in Cmnd. 218 which was circulated with C. (57) 254 was intended to serve as a convenient work of reference for thefuture consideration of matters arising out of the Report of the Franks Committee.I now circulate a revised version of the summary, amended to incorporate variouscorrections which my colleagues have made.2. This revision has entailed a recount of the classification of the findings ofthe Ministerial Committee which was given in paragraph 5 of C. (57) 251. It now appears with the figures for the earlier count shown for comparison in brackets that some 72 (71) out of the 95 Recommendations are either completely or broadly acceptable; 8 (8) are acceptable to a lesser or minor degree; 11 (12) must be reserved, in whole or in part, for further consideration; and 4 (4) must be considered as rejected. This classification, which is necessarily somewhat arbitrary, is merelyintended to indicate the proportions in which the Report as a whole is acceptable.K.House of Lords, S.W. 1,25th November, 1957.Printed for the Cabinet.

COMMITTEE ON ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALSFindings of the Committee on the Recommendations in the Report of theCommittee on Administrative Tribunals and EnquiriesPART A.-TRIBUNALS IN GENERAL&quot;(1) Two standing Councils* on Tribunals, one for England and Wales andone for Scotland, should be set up to keep the constitution and working of tribunalsunder continuous review. The Council for England and Wales should be appointedby and report to the Lord Chancellor. The Scottish Council should be appointedby and report to the Secretary of State for Scotland.   (Paragraph 43.) &quot;Substantially accepted. Because of the number of tribunals organised ona basis common to Great Britain as a whole a single Council (to be appointedjointly by the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Scotland) with provision for setting up a special Scottish panel is preferable to two Councils.&quot; (2) Chairmen of tribunals should be appointed by the Lord Chancellor (or alternatively in Scotland, by the Lord President of the Court of Session or theLord Advocate). Members should be appointed by the Council on Tribunals.Recommendations for appointment by the Crown should be made by the LordChancellor.   (Paragraphs 48^19, 53-54.) &quot;Partly accepted. With few exceptions, it is &quot;practicable for chairmen tobe appointed by the Lord Chancellor and the Lord President of the Court of session. To preserve accountability to Parliament and avoid duplication ofwork members of tribunals will in general be appointed by the minister concerned, but in consultation with the Council on Tribunals. Recom-mendations for appointments by the Crown will be made by the LordChancellor, or, for appointments to Scottish tribunals, by the Secretary ofState for Scotland.&quot; (3) Responsibility for the removal of chairmen and members should rest withthe Lord Chancellor or, alternatively, in Scotland, with the Lord President of theCourt of Session or the Lord Advocate.   (Paragraphs 51, 53.) &quot;Substantially accepted. With a few specific exceptions in the case ofchairmen, dismissal in England and Wales will rest with the Lord Chancellor,and in Scotland with the Lord President of the Court of Session.&quot; (4) All chairmen of tribunals exercising appellate functions should have legalqualifications; chairmen of tribunals of first instance should ordinarily have legalqualifications.   (Paragraphs 55, 58.) &quot;Substantially accepted. The qualification is that &quot; ordinarily &quot; would not &apos;involve the dismissal of competent lay chairmen, or preclude the employmentof a substantial number of lay chairmen in special classes of tribunal (e.g.,National Assistance Tribunals).&quot; (5) In general, tribunal service should not be whole-time or salaried.(Paragraph 57.)&quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (6) Some appointments should be paid, and remuneration should be reviewed by the Council on Tribunals.   (Paragraph 57.) &quot;Entirely accepted.-Thc Council should, however, confine its recommendations regarding remuneration to general terms., &quot; (7) The present arrangements for providing clerks of tribunals shouldcontinue.  The duties of a clerk should be confined to secretarial work, the taking* For simplicity, elsewhere in the Summary of Main Recommendations; except in recommendations(29)-(33), which relate to the proposed constitution and functions of the Councils, we refer to the&quot; Council on Tribunals.&quot;  This term covers either or both Councils as appropriate.
of notes of evidence, and advice on the tribunals functions. Unless sent for toadvise he should be debarred from retiring with the. tribunal.   (Paragraph 61.) &quot;Substantially accepted. The Council should be asked to advise on detailed application of the recommendation to debar the clerk from retiring with thetribunal unless sent for.&quot; (8) The detailed procedure for each tribunal should be designed to meet itsparticular circumstances and should be formulated by the Council on Tribunals inthe light of the general principles enunciated in this Report. The aim shouldgenerally be to combine an orderly procedure with an informal atmosphere.(Paragraphs 63-64.)&quot;Entirely accepted. The Council on Tribunals will not be the rule-makingauthority, but will act in an advisory capacity in this matter.&quot; (9) Every care should be taken to ensure that the citizen is aware of and fullyunderstands his right to apply to a tribunal.   (Paragraph 67.) &quot;Entirely accepted.&quot;(10) The citizen should know in good time before the hearing the case which he will have to meet. He should accordingly receive a document setting outthe main points of the opposing case.   (Paragraphs 71-72.)&apos;&apos;Entirely accepted.&quot; (11) Documents relating to tribunal proceedings should be clearly designated as documents of the tribunal and should come from the tribunal and not from aGovernment Department.   (Paragraph 73.) &quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (12) An adequate opportunity of attending the hearing or inspection shouldbe given to the parties.   (Paragraph 74.) &quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (13) Hearings before tribunals should be held in public, except in caseswhere:  (i) considerations of public security are involved; (ii) intimate personalor financial circumstances have to be disclosed; or (iii) the hearing is a preliminaryinvestigation of a case involving professional capacity and reputation. A tribunalconcerned almost exclusively with any of these types of case should sit in private.(Paragraphs 77-81.)&quot;Substantially accepted-The. qualification is that hearings before theNational Health Service Tribunal should continue to be in private (i.e., not onlythe &quot;preliminary investigation &quot; by the appropriate Service Committee).&quot; (14) Consideration should be given to the conferment of absolute privilegeon witnesses before tribunals, at any rate on those giving evidence on oath.(Paragraph 82.)&quot;Substantially accepted. It is agreed that sworn witnesses should haveabsolute privilege; the conferment of privilege on other witnesses and ondocumentary evidence should be considered by the Council.&quot;(15) The right to legal representation before tribunals should be curtailedonly in the most exceptional circumstances.   (Paragraph 87.) &quot;Substantially accepted. In fact, it is proposed to go further and removeall restrictions on legal representation before tribunals. But furtherconsideration will need to be given to the position of Local Service Committeesunder the National Health Service.&quot; (16) The official scheme of legal aid should be extended at once to tribunalswhich are formal and expensive and to final appellate tribunals. Any extension ofthe scheme to cover a wider range of proceedings in courts should be accompaniedby an extension to other tribunals.  (Paragraph 89.) &quot;Rejected. The proposal to extend legal aid to certain tribunals must take its place in the queue of prior and competing claims for the extension of this service.
&quot; (17) Tribunals should have power to administer the oath. Those most akinto courts of law should always take evidence on oath. Others should not normallydo so. (Paragraph 91.) &quot;Substantially accepted. The qualification is that in some cases, for the sake of informality and simplicity, it may be undesirable for the tribunal tohave the power. On this basis the recommendation should be referred to theCouncil.&quot; (18) Tribunals should have power to subpoena witnesses to give evidence orproduce documents.  (Paragraph 92.) &quot;Substantially accepted. The Council should be invited to considerwhether the power should rest with the tribunal or be exercisable only by thehigher courts.&quot; (19) Parties should be free to question witnesses directly and not only throughthe chairman.  (Paragraph 93.) &quot;Entirely accepted. .&quot; (20) Present arrangements for the award of costs and payment of expensesof parties should be reviewed by the Council on Tribunals. The general principles should be that: -  (i) a successful applicant should be given a reasonable allowance in respect of his expenses, including in some cases an allowance for the cost of legal,representation; (ii) an unsuccessful applicant should never have to pay any costsbut before social service and most other tribunals should be entitled to the samereasonable allowance as the successful applicant. In dispute between private parties,however, the parties should bear their own expenses and costs, except at the appellate level or where a party has acted frivolously or vexatiously, when thetribunal should have power to order the unsuccessful party to pay a sum towardsthe other&apos;s costs and expenses.  (Paragraphs 94-96.) &quot;Reserved-The payment of applicants&apos; legal expenses would lead to the excessive employment of lawyers and consequently to delay and undue,formality, but the payment of legal expenses in cases taken to appeal by theDepartment concerned in order to obtain a clarifying judgment on a point ofprinciple will be considered. The recommendation should be remitted to theCouncil for advice on this basis. Meanwhile no undertaking should be given that the award of costs would be considered sympathetically in certain types of case.&quot; (21) Notwithstanding recommendation (20), no change should be made inthe powers of the Lands Tribunal and the Transport Tribunal to award costs or inthe power of the Minister of Labour and National Service to pay allowances toparties or witnesses before Re-instatement Committees or the Umpire.(Paragraph 97.)&quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (22) Decisions of tribunals should be reasoned and as full as possible.(Paragraph 98.)&quot;Substantially accepted. In some categories of case, as the franks committee recognised, reasons cannot be formally stated. detailed consideration of the application of the recommendation should be referred tothe Council.&quot; (23) As soon as possible after the hearing a tribunal should send to the partiesa written notice of decision, which should set out the decision itself, the findings of fact by the tribunal, the reasons for the decision and the rights of appeal againstthe decision.  (Paragraphs 99-100.) &quot;Substantially accepted. The qualification is that noted in connection withrecommendation (22) above.
&quot; (24) Final appellate tribunals should publish selected decisions and circulatethem to lower tribunals.. (Paragraph 102.) &quot;Substantially accepted. Subject to (i) the qualification noted in connectionwith recommendation (22) above so far as relevant; and (ii) the fact that thereare some tribunals to which it would be impracticable or undesirable to applythis particular procedure.&quot; (25) There should be an appeal on fact, law and merits from a tribunal off first instance to an appellate tribunal, except where the tribunal of first instance isexceptionally strong and well qualified.   (Paragraphs 105-106.)&quot;Substantially accepted. This recommendation, which substantiallyreflects present practice, is accepted in principle but its application to particular cases requires further, consideration.&quot; (26) As a matter of general principle appeal should not lie from a tribunal to a Minister.  (Paragraph 105.) &quot; &quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (27) An appeal on a point of law should lie to the courts from a tribunaldecision, except from a decision of the National Insurance Commissioner, theIndustrial Injuries Commissioner or National Assistance&quot; Appeal Tribunals. Themachinery for such appeals should be simple, cheap and expeditious and should be formulated in detail by the appropriate Rule Committees. Decisions of theNational Insurance Commissioner, the Industrial Injuries Commissioner or national Assistance Appeal Tribunals should remain subject to review by certiorari.(Paragraphs 107-112.)&quot;Substantially accepted. (See note on recommendation (25) above.)&quot; (28) No statute should contain words purporting to oust the remedies byway of certiorari, prohibition and mandamus.  (Paragraph 117.) &quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (29) The Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of Sjtate for Scotland,respectively, should be responsible for the statutory action to give effect to recommendations of the Council on Tribunals for England and Wales and theScottish Council.   (Paragraphs 131-132.)&quot;Partly accepted. The two qualifications are: (i) existing rule-makingpowers should not in general be transferred to the Lord Chancellor becauseof the administrative burden this would place on his Department; and (ii) itwould be inappropriate for regulations on certain matters (notably tribunalremuneration) to be made by the Lord Chancellor rather than the departmental minister. The rule-making authority for Scottish tribunals will be the lord president of the Court of Session.&quot; (30) The main function of the Councils should be to advise on the detailed application to the various tribunals of the general principles of constitution,organisation and procedure enunciated in this Report.   (Paragraph 133.)&quot;Entirely accepted.&quot;(31) Any proposal to establish a new tribunal should be referred to the council&apos;s for their advice.   (Paragraph 133.)&quot;Substantially accepted. But consultation with the Council about futuretribunals should not include the questions whether a tribunal was to beestablished and what issues should be decided by the tribunal.&quot; (32) The Councils should have power to take evidence, and their reports should be published.   (Paragraph 133.)&quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (33) The Councils should comprise both lay and legally qualified members,:with a lay majority. The chairmen should be salaried and need not be lawyers.(Paragraph 134.)&quot;Entirely accepted.
PART B.-PARTICULAR TRIBUNALS&quot;(34) The general principles enunciated in Part II should, unless otherwisestated, be applied to all tribunals within our terms of reference (except those mentioned in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Appendix II).   (Paragraph 135.) &quot;Substantially accepted. This recommendation is clearly right in principlebut the Government cannot commit itself to complete acceptance. A numberof recommendations have to be referred to the Council for advice on their particular application, and it will clearly take the Council some time to review&apos;the constitution and working of the many tribunals within their purview.&quot; (35) Whenever it is proposed to establish a new tribunal consideration should first be given to the possibility of vesting the jurisdiction in an existingtribunal.   (Paragraph 139.) &quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (36) The adjudicating functions now exercised by County AgriculturalExecutive Committees should be entrusted to new independent tribunals fromwhich appeal should lie to an Agricultural Land Tribunal or to the Scottish LandCourt.  (Paragraph 148.)&quot;&quot; (37) All chairmen of these new tribunals should have legal qualifications andbe wholly independent of the area concerned.   (Paragraph 149.)&quot;&quot; (38) These tribunals should have the right, on giving due notice, to inspectthe land.   (Paragraph 150.) &quot;&quot; (39) A proposal to make a supervision order should be heard by one of thenew tribunals, and an appeal should lie to an Agricultural Land Tribunal or tothe Scottish Land Court against- approval of the making of an order.(Paragraph 152.)&quot;* Accepted in principle, or in substance (4 Recommendations). Thequestion of transferring to independent tribunals the adjudicating functions ofthe County Agricultural Executive Committees in regard to agriculturaldiscipline will not now arise, as it has been decided to repeal the disciplinary actions contained in the Agriculture Acts of 1947 and 1948. The judicial functions now exercised by these Committees in disputes over notices to quitwill be transferred, under forthcoming legislation, to the Agricultural LandTribunals or, in Scotland, to the Scottish Land Court. Both these latter bodies are independent of the agricultural Ministers. Consideration is also being given to transferring to the Agricultural Land Tribunals and.the Scottish LandCourt other judicial functions now exercised by the County Committeesincluding that of dealing with applications from tenants wishing to carry outlong-term improvements to which the landlord does not consent.&quot; (40) The numbers of representatives of local authorities on Local ValuationCourts in England and Wales should be reduced. Persons acting as chairmenshould be independent of any local authority, and members of local authoritiesshould not hear any case relating to property within the electoral area which they represent on the local authority or within the electoral area in which they live.(Paragraphs 155-156.)&quot;Reserved. No change should be made for the present in the method of appointment of chairmen and members of Local Valuation Courts. Thepanels (from which the Courts are selected) are appointed by local authoritiesand the work is unpaid; it would be very difficult to find many people, not local* The note under recommendations (36)-(39) - above summarises the relevant proposals inC. (57) 240 which were approved by the Cabinet.
authority members, willing and competent to do the work and there has beenvery little criticism of the work of the Courts. (Further consideration will begiven to the proposal in paragraph 156.)The Council on Tribunals will be asked to review this work in due course.&quot;(41) All chairmen of Rent Tribunals should have legal qualifications.(Paragraph 163.)&quot;Substantially accepted. Legally qualified chairmen are being appointed&apos;-in most cases; but it is not proposed to dismiss competent lay-chairmen, nor to preclude the occasional appointment of well-qualified laymen in future.&quot; (42) The panels from which Rent Tribunals are constituted should includevaluers to serve when required.  (Paragraph 163.) &quot;Partly accepted. The contribution which valuers could make is nowlimited, especially in view of the curtailment of the jurisdiction of RentTribunals by the Rent Act, 1957, particularly in England and Wales.&quot; (43) An appeal should lie from a Rent Tribunal to an appellate tribunalconsisting of a County Court judge or sheriff, sitting with a valuer as assessor.(Paragraphs 165-166.) &quot;Accepted in principle. If Rent Tribunals were to be a permanent featurethe Government would think it appropriate to provide for an appeal fromtheir findings. But they are only kept alive from year to year under the expiring Laws Continuance Act and their work is shrinking. The tribunalsmay not continue to be needed for very much longer.&quot; (44) Legal representation should be permitted before a National InsuranceLocal Tribunal when the chairman considers that the claimant cannot satisfactorilypresent his case unless allowed to employ a lawyer.   (Paragraph 174.)&quot;Entirely accepted. This recommendation is in fact superseded by thedecision to remove all restrictions on legal representation before tribunals.&quot; (45) National Insurance Local Tribunals should sit in public except when a case involves the disclosure of intimate personal or financial circumstances(Paragraph 175.)&quot;Entirely accepted. This is a consequential of recommendation (13).&quot; (46) In &quot;both national insurance and industrial injuries cases all parties should have an automatic right of appeal to the appropriate Commissioner.(Paragraph 177.)&quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (47) National Assistance Appeal Tribunals should continue to sit in private.(Paragraph 180.)&quot;Entirely accepted. This is a consequential of recommendation (13).&quot; ^48) Legal representation before National Assistance Appeal Tribunalsshould be permitted on the same basis as that recommended for National InsuranceLocal Tribunals see recommendation (44) above.   (Paragraph 183.)&quot;Entirely accepted. See note on recommendation (44).&quot; (49) The functions of Family Allowance Referees should be transferred to national Insurance Local Tribunals, with appeal to the National InsuranceCommissioner.   (Paragraph 184.) &quot;Entirely accepted. Some matters of detail will require furtherconsideration.&quot; (50) Appeals from the Medical Practices Committee should continue to lieto the Minister. The general recommendations in Part II should not be strictlyapplied to this Committee because of its special character.  (Paragraph 193.)&quot;Entirely accepted.
&quot; (51) Complaints against practitioners should continue to be first heard by service Committees and decided thereafter by Executive Councils, subject tofurther appeal.  (Paragraphs 192, 194.) &quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (52) Service Committees should continue to sit in private. (Paragraph 195.) &quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (53) Service Committees should normally administer the oath. (Paragraph196.)&quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (54) Complainants should be entitled to apply for the assistance of an officialrepresentative at hearings before Service Committees. Clerks to executive councils should continue to assist complainants in preparing their statements of case.  (Paragraph 200.) &quot;Partly accepted. The last part is acceptable. The first part has still tobe considered in the light of the provisional decision to permit legalrepresentation before these tribunals, but any such official representations should be provided by Executive Councils and not the Health Departments.&quot; (55) The general recommendations in Part II should not be strictly appliedto Executive Councils, which are principally administrative bodies. (Paragraph201.)&quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (56) The National Health Service Tribunal should in general sit in public.(Paragraph 203.) &quot;Rejected-The TribunaFs jurisdiction is confined to National health service practice. Only the Disciplinary Committee of the General MedicalCouncil can debar a practitioner from all practice and since this Committeesits in public there is no need for the National Health Service Tribunal to do so.&quot; (57) The right of appeal from the National Health Service Tribunal to theMinister should be abolished, and the right of appeal from Executive Councils tothe Minister in certain cases should be replaced by a right of appeal to the Tribunal.As a safeguard for practitioners appeals by individual complainants should be heard by the Tribunal in private.   (Paragraphs 205-207.) &quot;Partly accepted. The first point, the abolition of appeal from theTribunal to the Minister is accepted. The last point, that certain appealsshould be heard in private, is covered by the rejection of recommendation (56).The remaining point that the appellate jurisdiction of the Minister in minordisciplinary cases is reserved for discussion with professional associations.&quot; (58) Hearings before Military Service (Hardship) Committees should be in public unless intimate personal or financial circumstances have to be disclosed.Legal representation should be permitted, and there should be ah automatic rightof appeal to the Umpire, at least on any point of law.   (Paragraphs 214-216.)-&quot;Substantially accepted. The qualification is that some restriction will bemaintained in appeals to the Umpire in hardship eases not involving points of law, in order to avoid an excessive number of appeals.&quot; (59) It is particularly important that the general recommendations in Paife IIconcerning the atmosphere of tribunal hearings and the publication of selectedappellate decisions should be applied to Conscientious Objectors Tribunals; an age-limit for members should also be considered.   (Paragraphs 217-219.)&quot;Entirely accepted. The atmosphere; of hearings and the publication of selected Appellate decisions are in the control of the Tribunals themselves and their attention will be drawn to these points. The consideration of age limits is a matter for reference to the Council.
&quot; (60) Pensions Appeal Tribunals should each include a practitioner withrecent clinical experience as far as possible directly related to the disability in thecase.  (Paragraph 221.)&quot;Reserved. There are practical difficulties to be discussed with ex-Serviceorganisations.&quot; (61) We recommend no change in existing arrangements for appeals from the licensing Authorities for Public Service and Goods Vehicles. From appealdecisions by the Minister a further appeal should lie to the courts on a point oflaw.  (Paragraphs 229-231.)&quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (62) The general recommendations in Part II should not be strictly appliedto the Transport Tribunals.  (Paragraph 232.) &quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (63) We have not examined the constitution and working of the Generaland Special Commissioners of Income Tax, which have recently been examinedfully by the Royal Commission on the Taxation of Profits and Income, but it maybe desirable to include the Commissioners within the terms of reference of theproposed Council on Tribunals.  (Paragraph 236.) &quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (64) Compensation Appeal Tribunals should be strengthened by vesting theappointment of both chairmen and members in the Lord Chancellor. We do not recommend the establishment of a further appellate tribunal, but there should bean appeal to the courts on a point of law.  (Paragraphs 238-239.) &quot;Substantially accepted. The qualification is that members shouldcontinue to be appointed by the Minister of Labour, but in consultation withthe Council on Tribunals. This is consequential on the general decision onthe appointment of members see note on recommendation (2). TheChairman of the Scottish Tribunal will of course be appointed by the lord president of the Court of Session.&quot; (65) The Council on Tribunals should consider the question of providing afurther appeal from the decisions of Independent Schools Tribunals.(Paragraph 241.)&quot;Entirely accepted. The Council should be invited to do this in the lightof experience gained from actual working of the Tribunals when they are set up.PART C-ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES (GENERAL QUESTIONS)&quot; (66) Although we confine ourselves to procedures relating to land the broad principles enunciated in Part IV should ordinarily be applied to other proceduresclearly within the second part of our terms of reference.   (Paragraph 242.) &quot;Reserved. The application of the general principles to procedures otherthan land procedures has not yet been considered.&quot; (67) An acquiring or planning authority should be required to make available, in good time, before the enquiry, a written statement giving full- particulars of its case. (Paragraph 281.)&quot;Substantially accepted. The proposal in paragraph 281 of the Reportthat this requirement should be statutory is not acceptable. To avoid thecourts of appeal being able to enquire into the merits of the case the obligationshould be to state an adequate case and should be included in rules ofprocedure for enquiries to be made by the Lord Chancellor (or the lord president of the Court of Session) with the advice of the Council on Tribunals.
&quot; (68) The deciding Minister should, whenever possible, make available beforethe enquiry a statement of the policy relevant to the particular case, but shouldbe free to direct that the statement be wholly or partly excluded from discussion at the enquiry.  (Paragraphs 287-288.)&quot;Rejected. Not only do the dimensions of the problem in practical termspreclude acceptance, but the issue of a policy statement in relation to aparticular case before it is enquired into might seem to prejudge the case.Steps will be taken, however, to make more generally known &quot;the policies which Ministers are applying in these fields.&quot; (69) If the policy changes after the enquiry the letter conveying the Minister^decision should explain the change and its relation to the decision.(Paragraph 289.)&quot;Partly accepted. Since the proposal (recommendation (68) above) that ministers should issue statements of policy in advance is rejected, this doesnot directly arise. But if the local authority have said on what policy they arerelying (as they should do) and if that policy changes, the Minister^ letterof decision would of course explain the change.&quot; (70) The main body of inspectors in England and Wales should be placed under the control of the Lord Chancellor, but inspectors may be kept in contact with policy developments in the Departments responsible for enquiries. Thepreference of certain Departments for independent inspectors appointed ad hocneed not be disturbed. If a corps of inspectors is established for Scotland, theLord Advocate should assume responsibility for it.   (Paragraphs 303-304.)&quot;. Partly accepted. The Minister of Housing must be able to exercise closecontrol over his inspectorate because of the need to deal expeditiously witha very large number of enquiries. The Minister of Power&apos;s electricalinspectors are engaged more on departmental administrative and advisorywork than on the quasi-judicial functions involved in enquiries and hearings.Whilst the transfer of inspectorates to the Lord Chancellor is, therefore,impracticable, it is proposed that inspectors should be appointed by theDepartmental Minister after consultation with the Lord Chancellor anddismissed only with his consent. But the existing practice whereby theScottish Departments and the Ministry of Education appoint persons from outside the Public Service will continue.&quot; (71) The initiating authority, whether a Minister or a local or other authority, should be required at the enquiry to explain its proposals fully and support them by oral evidence.  (Paragraph 308.) &quot;Substantially accepted. As with recommendation (67) this requirementshould be embodied in the rules of procedure.&quot; (72) The code or codes of procedure for enquiries should be formulated bythe Council on Tribunals and made statutory; the procedure should be simple andinexpensive but orderly.  (Paragraphs 310, 312.) &quot;Substantially accepted. The rules of procedure should be made by theLord Chancellor or the Lord President of the Court of Session on the advice of the Council.&quot; (73) In connection with the compulsory acquisition of land (and schemes which imply later acquisition), development plans, planning appeals and clearanceschemes, a public enquiry should be held in preference to a private hearing unlessfor special reasons the Minister otherwise decides.   (Paragraph 311.)&quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (74; The proceedings should be opened by the initiating party. Strict rules of evidence are not required, but the inspector should have power to administer the oath and subpoena witnesses. He should have a wide discretion in controlling theproceedings and should give rulings on the scope of the proposed ministerial policystatements.  (Paragraphs 312-313.)&quot;Substantially accepted. The qualification is that, since it is proposed to reject recommendation (68) the need for the inspector to give rulings on thescope of the policy statements does not arise.
&quot; (75) Officials of the Department of the deciding Minister should be requiredto give evidence if the enquiry is into a proposal initiated by that Minister, but not otherwise. Officials of other Departments should, if required, give factual evidence in support of the views of their Department if these views are referred to by a public authority in its explanatory written statement (see recommendation 67) or in itsevidence at the enquiry.  (Paragraphs 317-318.) &quot;. . Substantially accepted. The qualification is that officials of the agriculture Deparments should not be required to give evidence in cases where their Department has expressed no view on proposals to alienate agricultural land (see paragraph 319 of the Report).&quot; (76) In compulsory acquisition cases and clearance schemes reasonable costsshould generally be awarded to successful objectors directly interested in the land;they should only be awarded to unsuccessful objectors if the initiating authority hasacted unreasonably. Costs should only be awarded against an unsuccessful objectorif he has acted frivolously or vexatiously.   (Paragraph 323.) &quot;Reserved. It may be right to award costs more frequently but thequestion in cases of compulsory acquisition as elsewhere, is not asstraightforward as the Franks Committee seemed to think. Therecommendations on costs require further consideration in consultation withthe Council.&quot; (77) In planning appeals reasonable costs should generally be awarded toowner appellants if their appeals succeed or if the local planning authority has actedunreasonably. Costs should exceptionally be awarded to other successfulappellants.  (Paragraph 324.)&quot;Reserved. See note on recommendation (76) above.&quot; (78) Any award of costs should be made by the Minister. The inspectorshould hear submissions by the parties on costs and, where appropriate, made recommendations in his report.   (Paragraph 325.)&quot;Entirely accepted. But see note on recommendation (76) above.&quot; (79) The Council on Tribunals should consider the basis on which&quot; reasonable costs &quot; should be assessed and keep under review the arrangements regarding the award of costs.  (Paragraph 326.) &quot;Entirely accepted. See note on recommendation (76) above.&quot; (80) Reports should be divided into two parts:   (i) summary of evidence,findings of fact and inferences of fact; and (ii) reasoning from facts, includingapplication of policy, and (normally) recommendations. (Paragraph 328.) &quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (81) The complete text of the report should accompany the Minister^ letterof decision and also be available on request centrally and locally. (Paragraph 344.) &quot;Accepted in principle. Reports will be published where desired, but themethod of publication needs to be further considered. The Government are anxious to limit the distribution of paper to the minimum necessary to enableanyone who wants to see the report to do so.&quot; (82) Additionally, if any of the following parties desires an opportunity to propose corrections of fact, the first part of the report should, as soon as possible after the enquiry, be sent to:  (i) the promoting authority (or local planning authority) and any other authority which gave evidence; and (ii) all persons wholodged written objections (in planning appeals the applicants). Recipients shouldbe allowed fourteen days in which to propose corrections. The inspector should decide whether to accept any proposed correction.  (Paragraph 345.) &quot;Reserved. An effort will be made to find satisfactory ways and means ofgiving effect to this recommendation. Nevertheless, the Departmentsconcerned see considerable difficulties in applying this recommendation, partly because of the invitation it would give to objectors to re-open the argumentand because a strict dividing line between facts and conclusions cannot always be drawn.
&quot; (83) The deciding Minister should be required to submit to the parties concerned for their observations any factual evidence, including expert evidence,obtained after the enquiry. (Paragraph 350.) &quot;Substantially accepted. The qualification is that &apos;; expert evidence&quot;should not include technical or other advice given by civil servants.&quot; (84) The Ministers letter of decision should set out in full his findings andinferences of fact and the reasons for the decision.  (Paragraph 352.) &quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (85) The present special form of appeal to the courts in procedures relatingto land should be retained and also applied to decisions on planning appeals. Thetime-limit for lodging such appeals could be reduced if recommendation (82) is accepted.  (Paragraph 359.) &quot;Entirely accepted.PART D.-PARTICULAR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES RELATINGTO LAND&quot; (86) Acquiring authorities should notify as early as possible those likely tobe affected by their proposals.   (Paragraph 367.) &quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (87) Save in time of emergency or threat of emergency or in special securitycases the Service Departments should be required to adopt the same procedure foracquiring land as other Departments.   (Paragraph 370.) &quot;Partly accepted. Two main considerations prevent acceptance of therecommendation as it stands: (i) the great urgency of some land requirements for defence purposes at times where there is no emergency or threat ofemergency; and (ii) the need to avoid spotlighting cases involving security. Analternative procedure is, therefore, proposed for safeguarding the rights of theindividual in these cases. Private owners and occupiers would be given a statutory right to object and to have an independent hearing of their objectionsby a person of suitable status and judicial qualifications appointed by theLord Chancellor (or, in Scotland, by the Secretary of State for Scotland). the inspector would have discretion to grant a public hearing in cases not involvingsecurity. He would submit his recommendations to the Service minister concerned who must retain an overriding right of rejection, but would besubject to an obligation to inform the appellant that the inspector had recommended in the latter&apos;s favour, when that was the case. While the inspector^ recommendations would not be published as such, the appellantwould be informed of them in as much detail as security considerations would permit. Subject to these additional arrangements, the existing procedures for services&apos; land acquisitions would continue.&quot; (88) Objectors should give advance written notice of proposals for alternativesites; discussion of such sites at the enquiry should otherwise be disallowed.(Paragraph 372.)&quot;Reserved. Proposals for alternative sites should not be discussed in theabsence of owners. It might be difficult to insist on their attendance, and itwould be pointless to do so unless the alternative site offered real prospects.While further consideration will need to be given to this recommendation, its acceptance would present the Ministry of Power with serious difficulties, partly because a private amenity interest raising objections could scarcely be expectedto bear the cost of advertising his proposed alternative site under the statutory-procedures provided; and partly because an alternative site for a particularelectricity pylon is likely to interfere with the- main,route of the line over aconsiderable distance.
&quot; (89) Compulsory purchase orders requiring confirmation should be restyled&apos; draft compulsory purchase orders.&apos;   (Paragraph 374.) &quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (90) The Minister should publish any modifications which he proposes tomake to a development plan, and twenty-one&quot;days should be allowed for the lodgingof objections to them. Any further enquiry should be limited to opposedmodifications.   (Paragraph 377.) &quot;Reserved. The recommendation is equitable but would add considerably to the length of time required to reach decisions on these plans. It requiresfurther consideration.&quot; (91) An appeal should lie to the courts on a point of law against a determination by the Minister as to what constitutes &apos; development.&apos;(Paragraph 381.) &quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (92) Local planning authorities should discuss applications with applicants.(Paragraph 382.) &quot;Entirely accepted.&quot; (93) Owners and others directly interested in the land should be informed of third party planning applications and allowed to state their views. They shouldalso be informed of the decision of the local planning authority and of the lodgingof an appeal.   (Paragraph 384.) &quot;Reserved. The Government sympathise with this proposal but there arepractical difficulties.   Being further considered.&quot; (94) The weight of planning appeal work falling upon the GovernmentDepartments concerned should be reduced by delegating some decisions toinspectors.   (Paragraph 392.) &quot;Rejected. It would not be appropriate to empower individual civilservants to give decisions for which the Minister could take no responsibility.&quot; (95) There should be an appeal to the Lands Tribunal (in Scotland to anindependent arbitrator) against a decision by the Minister that a property is &apos; unfit&apos;or against a refusal by the Minister to sanction a &apos; well maintained&apos; payment.(Paragraph 399.) &quot;Reserved. The provision of an appeal against refusal of a &quot; well maintained &quot; payment will be further considered. The provision of an appealto a tribunal on &quot; unfitness &quot; is impracticable for two main reasons: (i) thefact of unfitness must be established before the Minister confirms the clearanceor compulsory purchase order; and (ii) the criterion of unfitness cannot be fully codified.
