Printed for the Cabinet. November 1957C. (57) 280 Copy No.21st November, 1957CABINETWAGES: NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Minister of health the Cabinet will be aware of the ban on overtime, beginning on18th November, by the National Health Service staffs affected by the recent decision in respect of the Whitley agreement. The question of arbitration had been raised and discussed at a meeting between both Sides of the Whitley Council for adminsitrative and Clerical Staffs and the Under-Secretary of State for Scotlandand myself; but no request for it was then, or has so far been, made by the staff side. They may, however, request it at any time and I understand that they are seeking Counsels opinion about it. Further, by reason of the ban it is to beexpected that the question will be raised in other quarters. My colleagues thereforewill wish to be aware of the considerations which will arise.2. The Law Officers have advised that, in the event of a dispute betweenthe Ministers concerned and the Staff Side, which would arise if one were formally&quot; reported,&quot; the matter could be referred, with the consent of those Ministers, tothe Industrial Court or to arbitration under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919. they further advised that the present dispute with the Ministers could not be referred for decision under the Industrial Disputes Order, 1951, but they left open thequestion whether the matter could be dealt with under that Order as an issuebetween an individual Regional Hospital Board or Executive Council or a numberof Boards and Councils and their employees for final decision when that questioneventually arose.3. There are therefore three possible ways in which this matter might cometo arbitration:  (a) as a dispute with Ministers under the Act of 1919;(b) as a dispute with the management side collusively arranged on aresubmission of this claim;(c) as a dispute with an individual hospital authority under the industrial disputes Order, 1951.(b) and (c) are open to the serious disadvantage that they would really besham fights. In neither case would the respondents have any interest inrepresenting the Governmenfs point of view; and in case (b) there would be thefurther difficulty that as the arbitration would be on a resubmission the award could and might easily be in excess of the original 3 per cent, agreement which is the causeof the present dispute. Such an award would, of course, be confidently represented as demonstrating objectively and conclusively the unreasonableness of the government&apos;s original decision.4. It is therefore clear that if in the event this issue is to be arbitrated theadvantage lies in having an arbitration between the Staff Side and the Secretaryof State for Scotland and myself. The fact that arbitration is not excluded in this case has been made clear to the deputation from the Whitley Council, in bothHouses of Parliament and on television. The failure of the Staff Side to ask for it.so far may only be due to a desire to clarify the legal position. It may be, however,that their proclaimed enthusiasm for arbitration in principle is tempered by acautious hesitancy to ask for it in this particular case. If the question ofarbitration is raised I would propose, subject to the views of the Cabinet, to consent52626
to procedure under the Industrial Courts Act and to announce in advance thatI would hold myself bound by the results.5. It would be wrong, however, to cloak the great difficulties for the national health Service in the acceptance of arbitration awards made by arbitrators fixedwith no more precise responsibility in the general economic context than a presumedawareness of pronouncements by Ministers on economic affairs. It may be thatthis presumption will be insufficient to influence the decisions of arbitrators in the desired direction. An arbitrator into any dispute, industrial or otherwise, isbasically performing the judicial function of trying a lis between two parties. an industrial arbitrator, however, has to do so without the advantage either of statutoryguidance or of case law. It may be difficult for him, therefore, to do other thantake into account primarily cost of living, comparability and conciliation andcompound from the trio an inevitably inflationary brew. But arbitrators are tryingaccording to their lights to do the duty entrusted to them, i.e., to decide an issuebetween the parties before them. They may well take the view that if they are totake into account wider economic considerations and the interests of &quot; the unheardparty,&quot; they should be fixed with a clear responsibility in law in the shape of statutory guidance; in default of it they may well continue to do the normal dutyof an arbitrator and leave wider considerations to the Government. If events take this course, the anticipated increase in the number of wage increases settled by arbitration will, of course, result in an addition to the national wage bill.6. The National Health Service shares to the full in these general difficulties.But it has others besides. The disputes over the general industrial field whichresult in arbitration arise out of negotiations where the parties are at arms length.Over part at any rate of the National Health Service field, the parties, consciousperhaps of the disadvantageous position of the National Health Service in comparison with other employments, tend to negotiate arm in arm. It follows thatit is impossible always to rely on the offers of Management Sides being as low asthey would be in the case of employers who have to find the money to implementthem. At the same time, Staff Sides are likely to reject offers made even on this basis so as to be certain to secure arbitration, and thereby sidestep the possibilityof Ministerial disapproval of the agreement. With arbitration in view from the outset, they may, of course, also pitch their claims higher so as to increase theamount of an award based on splitting the difference between claim and offer. Inthe National Health Service field therefore even more than in the general field the increase in the proportion of wage claims settled by the awards of arbitrators,without statutory guidance and not fixed with direct responsibility to take intoaccount the requirements of the general economic position, is likely to addconsiderably to the wages bill.7. This raises the question of finding the money to meet any increase thatmight be awarded. On this question I am already in correspondence with theChancellor of the Exchequer, who is taking the general line that increases in wagesmust be met by retrenchment. I hope to be able to discuss this question further with him but in the meantime it is impossible to consider policy on arbitrationwithout taking it into account. It does not seem to me practical politics to meetthe cost of an award accepted by the Government by legislating to increase charges or Health Service contributions or by reducing services available to patients. Itmay be that there is still room for a certain reduction in paper work, leadingpossibly to some small reduction in staff, but this may depend on the abandonment of some existing central requirements. The administrative and clerical staffs ofevery hospital authority have been reviewed by visiting teams which securedreductions between 1951 and 1955; and since 1951 all additional appointmentshave needed prior approval. The results to be expected from any special review by my own O. and M. branch (which is in any case-continually at work) or bythe Treasury O. and M. or with outside assistance must be assessed in this context.A reduction in paper work depending on the reduction of central requirements is also not an easy solution because of its implications on, for example, thecollecting of costing or other information designed to. promote economy and efficiency. In any event, however, in spite of these difficulties, if ultimately theadministrative and clerical workers, whose 3 per cent, increase has so far beenwithheld, should get that increase (or more) by an arbitration award, I should propose, subject to the views of the Cabinet, to announce, if only for presentationalreasons, that I was seeking a diminution of the paper work for which they are
responsible. Subject to the possibility of further economies I should like to be assured that additions to meet the cost of an arbitrator^ award (or approvedWhitley agreements) will be forthcoming from the Exchequer.8. While I am naturally apprehensive of the consequences of widespreadincreases in National Health Service wages following an arbitration award, I mustremind the Cabinet that National Health Service employees are not in the vanof inflation; on the contrary they are panting distinctly, if doggedly, in the rear.It would be wrong that the need for disinflationary policies should fix them at apermanent disadvantage. This raises the question not only of their relation to others engaged in socially useful, but not directly productive work; but the more general question of what should be our policy regarding the remuneration of people doing such work. It would seem reasonable to take the view that while these people should not lead the van in a period of increasing wage rates, theyshould not be allowed to fall substantially behind increases granted to productiveworkers. Here again there is a danger in unguided arbitration. Arbitrators intoindustrial wage disputes, left without guidance, may well be inclined to awardthe whole of any increase in the gross national product to direct industrialproducers, with the result that further increases for the other group are inflationaryif made: if on the other hand they are not made, this group is denied a share in an expanding economy. It should be recognised that present relativities between different types of workers in this group and between one group and the otherare not necessarily right and revaluation involving increased remuneration shouldnot be ruled out.9. I should perhaps mention that there are certain other Whitley agreementsrequiring my approval, which will shortly have to be dealt with. Some of thesegive cost-of-living increases on salaries in operation for a relatively long time,some are revaluation and some a combination of the two: all are within authorities from the Treasury. In promulgating these decisions I shall seek to make clear ineach case the principle on which the decision is taken and its relation to thedecisions taken on the administrative and clerical officers with salaries up to  1,200and over  1,200 respectively.10.   To summarise the lines on which I suggest we should proceed:  (a) Consent should be given to arbitration under the Industrial Courts Actif asked for, and the Health Ministers should announce in advance thatthey would be bound by the results.(b) The position of the National Health Service, and any other comparableparts of the public sector, should be taken into account in decidingon policies in regard to arbitration.(c) If an arbitration award gave increases to administrative and clerical staffs,the paper work of the Service should be reviewed to see if reductions in staff are practicable.(d) Subject to paragraph (c), additions to National Health Service estimatesrequired to cover the cost of an arbitrator^ award (or approved Whitleyagreements) should be met.(e) Wage claims in respect of people doing socially useful but not directlyproductive work should be dealt with on the lines that, while these people should not lead the van, they should not be allowed to fallsubstantially behind productive workers. Revaluation of certain types of work should hot be ruled out.D. W. S.Ministry of Health, W. 1,20th November, 1957.
