DEFENCE:  MAN-POWER policy memorandum by the Minister of defence on 14th October the Cabinet invited me to circulate amemorandum on Service man-power, with particular reference to theprospects of obtaining sufficient voluntary recruits to end National Service(C.C.(58) 75th Conclusions, Minute 3).2. It is the Governments declared policy to bring National service to an end by December, 1962 and thereafter to rely on all-regular forcesof a combined strength of about 375,000.   In order to allow some flexibility, the Services have been given authority to recruit up to a totalof 388,000 (Navy - 88.000; Army - 165,000;  Royal Air Force - 135,000).3. If anything like the present rates of recruitment are maintained,these targets will easily be reached and, if required, exceeded.   There maybe some shortfall in certain of the administrative branches for such duties as cooking, store-keeping and nursing;  but this is by no means certain.In any case, the numbers involved are relatively small and various wayscan be found of overcoming such shortages should they occur.4. Nobody can, of course, be sure that there will not be some falling off in the rate of recruitment, but there are certainly no signs of it atpresent.5. The Navy are already turning away recruits to prevent theirceiling of 88,000 being exceeded.6. Before long the Royal Air Force will likewise have to restricttheir intake to keep within their planned strength of 135,000.   Owing to the inevitable uncertainty about the future of manned aircraft, the recruitment of officers for flying duties is at present lagging;  and I am considering withthe Secretary of State for Air whether some statement can be made whichwould reassure prospective entrants about career prospects.   Since it has never been the practice to obtain air crew other than by voluntary enlistment,this problem does not affect the issue of National Service.7. Unless there is a complete change in the trend of recruitment, weshall certainly be able to obtain appreciably more recruits than would be needed to provide an Army of the planned strength of 165,000.   In fact, itseems probable that recruits sufficient for an Army of over 180,000 will be forthcoming.8. In the light of this situation, we have, I am sure, every reason forconfidence in our ability to carry through our plan to end National service in 1962.Ministry of Defence, S.V/.1.
