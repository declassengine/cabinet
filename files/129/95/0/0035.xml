Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1958C. (58) 235 Copy No.5514th November, 1958CABINETGHANA: RELATIONS WITH GUINEAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations am sorry to produce this paper at short notice but the unpredictableDr. Nkrumah, Prime Minister of Ghana, may be about to make a move of whichthe Cabinet should be forewarned. I am informed by our High Commissioner inAccra and by the Governor-General of Ghana, Lord Listowel, who is now in thiscountry, that the Prime Minister of Guinea, M. Sekou Toure, is in touch withdraw. Nkrumah on the question of some form of close association between ghana and Guinea. It is by no means clear precisely what form this association might take, but we cannot exclude the possibility that either (a) a Federation of the twosovereign States or even (b) some form of complete absorption of Guinea withinGhana is contemplated. There is even a risk that we may at short notice be facedwith some fait accompli since the two Prime Ministers are understood to be meeting in Accra early next week.2. Any proposal that an independent foreign State should either merge inor federate with an existing Member country of the Commonwealth would giverise, quite apart from the numerous practical difficulties involved, to issues ofprinciple. The assent of all other Member countries would be required. Suchassent cannot be taken for granted. On the other hand, Dr. Nkrumah mightattach more importance to Ghana becoming the nucleus of a West african federation which would hope eventually to absorb the French West african territories as well as Togoland than to continued Membership of theCommonwealth.3. It is difficult profitably to consider this issue while we are in the dark as towhat precisely Dr. Nkrumah has in mind. But at the Annex to this paper I setout some of the arguments as I see them for and against our supporting any formof merger within the Commonwealth between Ghana and Guinea. From this it looks on balance as if such a development would be unwelcome at least to some members of the Commonwealth. It could also have unfortunate effects on ourrelations with France. Serious issues of principle for the Commonwealth would beraised by what would be the first dilution of the Commonwealth by the admissionof a foreign territory with a completely different background and history.4.   I think we can only wait and see what happens.H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,14th November, 1958.54324THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
ANNEXARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST A GHANA-GUINEA FEDERATIONBEING WITHIN THE COMMONWEALTHIf Ghana and Guinea are determined to federate or to form a unitary State,neither&apos;we nor the rest of the Commonwealth can stop them. The only choice thatwould then confront the Member countries would be whether the unified Statecould be a Member of the Commonwealth or not.2.   The following factors are considered seriatim:id) Local factors are Ghana and Guinea likely to be determined to federateat all costs or not?(b) United Kingdom, Commonwealth and Colonial factors a list of the obvious arguments for and against agreeing to such a federationremaining within the Commonwealth.(c) The French interest.(d) International repercussions.Local Factors3.   Local factors which exist in favour of federation include the following:(a) Dr. Nkrumah&apos;s ambitions and plans for local aggrandizement, leadingperhaps to the vision of a Federation of West African States; theseambitions may well have been sharpened by his apparent failure so far to induce French Togoland to throw in its lot with Ghana.ib) M. Sekou Toure&apos;s sense of isolation and his desire to score off the Frenchby showing that he has friends,(c) The possible desire of both Prime Ministers to build up a larger unit so thatthey will not be overshadowed by Nigeria after 1960.id) West African feeling that frontiers imposed during British, French, Belgian,German and Portuguese colonial eras were arbitrary.(e) The unifying factors of colour and of recently-won independence.(/) The possible hopes of M. Sekou Toure that, if he throws in his lot withGhana, and Ghana assumes responsibility for, e.g., defence and external affairs and enters into a customs union, there will be savings or receiptsto offset the loss of French subsidies. He might also hope to benefit from aid from the United Kingdom, Canada, &amp;c.4.   Factors adverse to any form of union include:  ia) Guinea would be very much the junior partner (population 2\ millions ascompared with Ghana&apos;s 5 millions).ib) Differences in language, traditions, legal and financial systems, culture,indeed everything except the unifying factor of colour.ic) Absence of a common enemy (as compared with the mutual enmity ofEgypt and Syria to Israel) though mutual dislike of the French exists.id) The possibility that Guinea might have difficulty in accepting The Queenas Head of the Commonwealth.ie) Financial difficulties of Guinea; federation would certainly cost Ghanamoney. Ghana has liquid cash but heavy liabilities both actual and potential, especially if she is determined to realise the Volta scheme.United Kingdom and Commonwealth Factors5. The following arguments could be advanced in favour of the acceptance by the Commonwealth of a Ghana-Guinea federation:  (a) It might add to the prestige of the Commonwealth if a foreign country even one so small and backward as Guinea were seen to join it.
(b) While Ghana remains in the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth can help to keep her on the right lines. If she left it, we should be less well placed to do so. And she could become a point d&apos;appui in West Africa forthe Russians or Egypt.(c) Ghana&apos;s role in the Commonwealth is still of little practical importance.But her independence was a symbol to the black peoples of Africa andthe fact that she remained within the Commonwealth redounded greatly to our own credit. Any secession from the Commonwealth is to bedeplored. The secession of a black African State might be misunderstood internationally as well as by Africans.(d) There are interests in  this country, and notably the &quot; ExpandingCommonwealth Group &quot; which would welcome such a broadening ofthe Commonwealth basis.(e) African nationalism shows signs of becoming more acute.   We allowedIndia to set a precedent in 1949 by remaining in the Commonwealth asa Republic. Ought we to risk a possible secession by Ghana over thepresent issue?(/) The absorption of Guinea would certainly dilute the Commonwealthconcept. But we and the other Commonwealth countries have shownourselves very flexible since 1939.6. Arguments against including a Ghana-Guinea federation in theCommonwealth:  (a) Repercussions in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth(i) Is such a dilution of the Commonwealth concept likely to attractgeneral support within the United Kingdom?(ii) All existing members of the Commonwealth (the French Canadianelement excepted) have at the outset been steeped in Britishtraditions, speak English, have close historical connections withthe United Kingdom, have strong economic and financial links with us, have based themselves af least in part on our system ofgovernment. All are lands either of British colonisation or inwhich the British have worked for many years.(iii) To accept a country into the Commonwealth which had no suchlinks with the United Kingdom or with any other commonwealth countries would be a major departure of principle.(iv) To include French Guinea, with its completely different history and background, in the Commonwealth could be the beginningof a process which would dilute the Commonwealth beyond thepoint where it would retain any real meaning.(v) Unless Ghana absorbed Guinea, a Guinean representative atPrime Ministers&apos; Meetings would inhibit discussion, while theexistence of a Guinean &quot; personality &quot; within the commonwealth would handicap full and frank exchange of information withother Commonwealth Governments. And if the example of theinclusion of Guinea in the Commonwealth as a sovereign butfederated state proved contagious, the whole character of PrimeMinisters&apos; Meetings would be changed.(vi) There would be numerous technical difficulties to be overcome,e.g., in relation to citizenship, finance. Imperial Preferences, &amp;c.(b) Repercussions in the Colonies(i) Sierra Leone is partially surrounded by Guinea.   The colonial government might see in any union between Ghana and Guineaa scheme designed eventually to absorb the colony in a widerfederation. The same fears might be shared in The Gambia.(ii) Such a union might excite British Somaliland to throw in its lotwith a free Italian Somaliland in 1960. This in turn might leadto demands for the admission of a &quot; Greater Somalia&quot; to commonwealth membership. Such a unit, even if other commonwealth countries were prepared to accept it, might prove an even more embarrassing Commonwealth bedfellowthan Guinea.
(c) International Repercussions(i) France, so shortly after losing Guinea, would&quot; not be likely to appreciate anything that could be interpreted as a gesture of friendship on the part of the Commonwealth towards Guinea.French public opinion would undoubtedly blame this countryrather than Ghana if any merger took place. And there wouldbe strong suspicions that Guinea was only the first target in an effort to seduce French West and Equatorial Africa. (LordListowel thinks that Dr. Nkrumah hopes that in due courseDahomey will also join with Ghana if Guinea does so.) (Percontra the United States might welcome any steps which Ghana,with or without Commonwealth approval, might take to prevent a power vacuum developing over Guinea.)(ii) A Ghana-Guinea union might inspire some kind of merger orfederation between Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. This couldwell prove very unpalatable to India.(iii) It would be likely to encourage pressure from the &quot; ExpandingCommonwealth Group &quot; and their supporters for bringing intothe Commonwealth one or more European powers, notablyNorway. Such action could well precipitate strong Sovietopposition.(iv) It might revive requests from the Sudan or Burma for re-admission to the Commonwealth. These would excite in the former casestrong Egyptian reactions, and in the latter important internalopposition.The Interests of Ghana Herself7. It is doubtful whether Dr. Nkrumah is as yet fully seized of the difficultieslisted above. And it may well be that he would underestimate their importance.Ghana&apos;s importance derives to no small extent - from her commonwealth membership. In the long run she is in any case likely to prove very much the junior partner to Nigeria, which has seven times her population; while if she were to secede over the Guinea issue, she might dwindle to the status of a secondLiberia. Finally, Dr. Nkrumah should not be over-confident about securingunanimous Commonwealth assent to his rumoured plans for union with Guinea.Canada, Ceylon and Malaya and perhaps New Zealand might be willing toaccept a Ghana-Guinea union within the Commonwealth. So might Pakistan,with her eyes on a possible federation with Iran and Afghanistan. That possibility,which could strengthen Pakistan, might weigh with India, which would howeverprobably support. It is perhaps, on the other hand, unlikely, for different reasons,that Australia or South Africa would welcome the change.November, 1958.
