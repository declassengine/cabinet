(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 260 COPY NO. J 119th December, 195&quot;cabinet civil, AVIATION:   JET aircraft memorandum by the Minister of Transport and civil AviationSince the Cabinet last considered this problem (C. C. (58) 6 VthConclusions, Minute 8) Comets of the British Overseas Airways Corporation(B.O.A.C.) and Pan American&apos;s Boeing 707s have been allowed to startregular services to and from London Airport under satisfactory conditionsagreed with the operators for the reduction of noise.     Unfortunately, it hasnot yet been possible to obtain the agreement of the Russians to similar conditions for the Soviet jet aircraft TU-104.2.     After repeated requests, the Russians have now given details of newoperating procedures which they claim will bring the noise level of theTU-104 down to the level of the Comet and the Boeing 7 07.    However, theRussian figures can only be properly evaluated if the aircraft is madeavailable for noise tests in London.    This the Russians have refused to doand I am convinced that they will not budge from this position.    It wouldnot be possible for us to carry out noise tests around airports on theContinent without the Rassians getting to know, and the airport authoritiesthere are not so far carrying out any systematic tests of their own.3.     As my colleagues are aware, the Port of New York Authority and Iinsisted that regular serices with the Boeing 707 and the Comet TV couldnot start at our airports until these aircraft had passed noise test       Thiscommon stand has forced the pace in noise abatement, but inevitably has aroused considerable criticism in the United States.4.      On the other hand, for as long as the present deadlock continues,British European Airways cannot start their service to Moscow and arelosing out to the Dutch, French and Belgians who already have services to Moscow.    More important still, we cannot open up negotiations with theRussians for a service by 3.O.A.C. across Russia to Tokyo.     3.O.A.C.would like to start this service as soon as possible.    They are losingsubstantial passenger and mail traffic to their competitors who operate to Tokyo over the Pole.    The trans-Russia route is even shorter.    If theRussians would grant rights to B.O.A.C., the latter would regain much thathas been lost to the initiative of the Polar operators.    We cannot thereforeafford to be too intransigent with the Russians without damaging our chancesin the next round of negotiations.5.      We must break this deadlock if possible as on balance it is in our interests to do so.    I propose, therefore, to inform the Russians that weshould be prepared to allow the TU-104 to start regular services intoLondon Airport for a trial period of thirty days.    During this time theaircraft would be permitted to take off only in one direction where the-1-CONFIDENTIAL
effect on built-up areas was least, and would be required to reach a minimumheight above built-up areas.    In certain weather conditions this couldconceivably mean that the aircraft would be grounded for several days, butthis would be the unfortunate result of the Russians&apos; refusal to bring theaircraft to London for prior tests.    Details will be worked out by myDepartment in the light of information provided by the Russians andsupplemented by such measurements as are being made at airports on theContinent into which the TU-104 is already flying.     If at the end of thistrial period the noise level is found to be acceptable, scheduled operationscould continue at London Airport under appropriate conditions.    If, on theother hand, the noise level proved higher than that of the Boeing 707( andon the information so far available I think this unlikely) stiffer conditions would be imposed on the Russian operations.6.      I am not certain that the Russians will accept this offer, but I hopemy colleagues will agree that this is as far as we should go.     It will alsobe necessary to get an assurance from the Russians that the TLM04 doesin fact meet internationally agreed standards.H.W.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation,V/. 1.19th December, 1955.-2-
