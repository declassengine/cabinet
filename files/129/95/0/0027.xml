Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1958Copy No.CABINETEMPLOYMENTDirective by the Prime MinisterSince the autumn of 1957 we have been fighting inflation. Our efforts have produced good results. International confidence in sterling has been restored; our reserves of gold and dollars have risen; we have secured greater stability in prices.2. The pendulum is now swinging a little too far in the opposite direction.Production is below the capacity of the economy, and labour and resources are under-employed. For the first time since the end of the war the unemploymentfigure has risen above 500,000. If this movement were not checked, we might find ourselves in a serious trade recession in 1959.3. The measures which the Government have successively taken in the last few months have been designed to provide a fresh stimulus to production. Butthe full effect of some of them will not be felt for some time. Additional measuresmust now be taken to increase output in those industries, and in those areas of thecountry, which are most adversely affected and to do so rapidly and effectively.For this purpose Departments directly concerned with the private sector of industry should at once consider what steps they could take to maintain confidence andstimulate activity. In the public sector all Departments should urgently re-examinetheir forward programmes of expenditure and investment in order to ascertain howfar, by adjustment or acceleration, they can provide further immediateopportunities for employment. Proposals (affecting either the private or thepublic sector) should be submitted promptly to the Treasury.4. The corrective measures needed now are measures to prevent thependulum from swinging too far in a deflationary direction. They must be short-term and quick to take effect. They must not entail commitments for thefuture which are either indefinite or excessive. The current need is for action whichwill give a quick and selective stimulus to production and employment withoutimposing a fresh strain on the balance of payments or overloading the economywith long-term expansionary plans which will lead in future years to a recurrence of inflationary pressure.H. M.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,27th October, 1958.C. (58) 22728th October, 1958SECRET
