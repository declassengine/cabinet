SECRETTHJS DOCUMENT SS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1958C (58) 216 Copy No. 622nd October, 1958CABINETCYPRUS : HUMAN RIGHTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for the colonies the Present PositionC (57) 258 referred to a second Application by the Greek Government,comprising twenty-nine cases of alleged ill-treatment by the Security Forces in cyprus, which had been admitted for examination by the European Human RightsCommission. The proceedings on this Application went forward by means ofwritten pleadings until 30th June, 1958, when the first oral hearing took place atStrasbourg. As a result of that hearing the Greek Government, who had beenpursuing a policy of calculated dilatoriness in the production of their writtenevidence (with the idea of persuading the Sub-Commission to conduct an inquiry into the allegations on the spot in Cyprus), were required to complete their writtensubmissions on all twenty-nine cases by 22nd July. Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere given until 10th September to complete their written submissions andcomments. A further oral hearing was fixed for 3rd October.2. Inter-communal violence in Cyprus reached its height during July, and work by the Cyprus administration on the collection of material to complete theUnited Kingdom&apos;s written evidence consequently had to be temporarily suspended.The United Kingdom agent informed the Sub-Commission of this suspension ofwork in August, and formally requested an extension of time of six weeks and acorresponding postponement of the oral hearing. The Sub-Commission have now agreed to this request, and have announced their intention of holding the oralhearing on 12th November. They have informed the parties that on that date theapplication &quot; will be taken up by the Sub-Commission under the conditions inwhich it then is.&quot;3. Meanwhile the Greek Government have submitted written evidence on alltwenty-nine cases. On our side, written evidence has already been submitted onten of the cases; some evidence is available but has not yet been submitted on afurther nine; and material on the remaining ten has still to come from Cyprus.It is uncertain whether all the outstanding evidence can in fact be made available for 12th November, but it is clear from the terms of the Sub-Commission&apos;communication referred to in paragraph 2 that they are not prepared to grant anyfurther postponement merely to enable evidence in writing to be collected.4. The most important question at the hearing will be that of witnesses.From the beginning it has been the object of the Greek Government to persuade theSub-Commission to hold an investigation on the spot (as was done on theApplication of 1956) at which oral evidence would be heard. So far, however, wehave succeeded in confining the proceedings to an exchange of written pleadingsand in putting off a decision by the Sub-Commission on the question of witnesses.We cannot, however, defer a consideration of this question by the Sub-Commissionany further. The Greeks have expressly requested the Sub-Commission to hearwitnesses in all twenty-nine cases, and will no doubt press this request at the hearing54211
on 12th November. We have therefore to decide what line the United KingdomAgent should take in dealing with this request, which may well receive a favourablehearing from the Sub-Commission.The Legal position. It is considered that in view of the absence of means of redress availableto individual complainants in Cyprus the Commission was within its rights underthe Convention in admitting the twenty-nine cases, and that the Sub-commission will also be within its rights if, at the appropriate time, it decides to hear witnesseseither in Cyprus or in Strasbourg. We should in any case find it difficult to argueotherwise, since the cases are of a sort on which no Anglo-Saxon court would beprepared to adjudicate on the basis of written evidence alone. The Sub-commission is entitled under Article 28 of the Convention^ request necessary facilities for itsinvestigations. Therefore a flat refusal on our part to co-operate in the productionof witnesses would constitute a breach of our obligations under the Convention.It might, however, be possible to justify a refusal to grant facilities which it is unreasonable of the Sub-Commission to request; for example, it is arguable thatin present circumstances Greek Cypriot witnesses are too intimidated by EOKA totell the truth, and it would therefore be unreasonable of the Sub-Commission toundertake an oral examination of witnesses at present.Objections to the Production of Witnesses6. There are strong objections, from the point of view of the Cyprusadministration, to the production of witnesses either in Cyprus or at Strasbourg.A local enquiry in Cyprus would (a) be exploited by the Greek Government and EOKA as a major victory intheir &quot; smear &quot; campaign against the British administration and security forces;(b) probably produce an explosive reaction from the Turkish Cypriots andthe Turkish Government, since Turkish members of the Cyprus police would be involved as witnesses. Indeed, in many of the cases they arethe persons alleged to be responsible for ill treatment;(c) seriously affect the morale of the armed forces and police as a whole.7. The objections to producing witnesses at Strasbourg are almost as strong.The harm would be less only to the extent that the Cyprus Government would be spared the special difficulties and unpleasantness of an inquiry into the actions ofits own servants taking place in the island itself.8. The first Sub-Commission, which enquired into the need for and use ofemergency powers in Cyprus (on the Application of 1956), took evidence mainly from officers and senior ranks who testified in a semi-official capacity. The Chiefsof Staff have expressed the view that if the present Sub-Commission were to take evidence from other ranks it would have a most serious effect on the morale of thetroops. In fact, many of the witnesses are other ranks, and of the remainder, themajority are officers of comparatively junior rank. Moreover, even if we were toagree to produce witnesses (and under Rule 54 of the Rules of Procedure we are obliged to arrange for our witnesses to appear) we could not compel them to doso, and the likelihood is that many of them would in fact refuse.Political Consequences of a Breach of the Convention9. Action on our part which could be represented as a breach of theConvention would have serious political consequences. It would certainly receivewidespread publicity, and might damage our reputation as one of the principalguardians of Human Rights. Many of our friends would be puzzled and dismayedand our opponents elated. If the action were taken during or immediately beforethe Cyprus Debate at the United Nations, we could expect the Greeks to make every effort to exploit the situation, and the General Assembly may well be morethan usually sensitive in Human Rights matters since the tenth anniversary of theadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is to be celebrated duringthe present Session. A break with the Sub-Commission might prejudice muchof the support which we have previously enjoyed at the United Nations and would
certainly lend weight to any call by the Greeks for a United Nations Police orobserver force. There would also be repercussions in the Third Committee. Atthe last Session, the Greek representative in the Third Committee gave notice thathis delegation might reintroduce an item calling for interim measures in respect ofviolations of Human Rights pending conclusion of the Covenant. A break withthe Sub-Commission would probably stimulate Greek action on this front alsoand might give the Greeks sufficient support to enable them to secure acceptanceof their proposals, which would of course be directed against ourselves.10. We should also be in difficulties from the European point of view. the human Rights Convention is held in high regard by many Europeanparliamentarians and a breach of it by us, even under the present severe provocation,would alienate many of our friends. It would probably lead to trouble in theCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe and prejudice their reception ofthe Commission^ report on the earlier Greek application which has just beencompleted. ,11. In general a refusal on our part to co-operate in the production of witnesseswould focus attention on the absence of redress at present available to complainantsin Cyprus, and would almost certainly be interpreted as implying that some at least of the charges are true.Recommendations12. From the international point of view therefore it is obviously desirablethat we should continue to co-operate with the Sub-Commission and agree to the hearing of witnesses, should the Sub-Commission decide to call them. It is howeverconsidered that so long as the present emergency continues in Cyprus, the arguments in paragraphs 6 to 8 must be regarded as overriding, and that consequently wecannot agree that witnesses should be called. Our tactics must therefore be directed towards:  (a) preventing the Sub-Commission from reaching a decision on the questionof witnesses with which we should have to refuse to comply; and(b) making sure that if such a refusal becomes unavoidable, it is made on grounds which will appear as reasonable as possible.13.   It is recommended that we should proceed as follows:(a) Every effort should be made to complete our written submissions on allthe cases in time for the oral hearing on 12th November. In this way we shall at least ensure that none (or very few) of the allegations is left totally unanswered;(b) We should attend the oral hearing and argue the merits of the cases onthe written evidence. We should take the line, as forcefully as possible,that the charges are ill-founded; that they have been brought from political, not humanitarian, motives and that they should be eitherwithdrawn or dismissed.(c) While not refusing to grant facilities which may ultimately be requested bythe Sub-Commission under Article 28 of the Convention, we should oppose the request of the Greek Government that the Sub-commission should now proceed to an investigation by the hearing of witnesses.The United Kingdom Agent should not commit Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment as to their attitude if the Sub-Commission should never-theless decide to hear witnesses, but he should oppose this course onthe following grounds:  (i) that in the existing circumstances in Cyprus witnesses are toointimidated to tell the truth;(ii) the weight of the Cyprus Government^ responsibilities for themaintenance of law and order is such &quot;that they should not berequired to give to witnesses the special personal protectionneeded to make them feel secure;(iii) we should expect the Sub-Commission themselves to recognise thatto call witnesses in the present circumstances could onlyaggravate inter-communal tension in Cyprus and might finallydestroy all hope of restoring lasting peace and unity in the island.
14. It is not easy to assess the likely reaction of the Sub-Commission to theline of the argument set out at (c) above. They may well refuse to accept it andinsist on calling witnesses. But the merit of the course recommended is that, if weare compelled to refuse to co-operate further with the Sub-Commission, it affordsus a ground for making the refusal which can be represented as a reasonable one and gives us a line of defence before public opinion and at the Committee ofMinisters of the Council of Europe. In any case the Sub-Commission are unlikely to issue a formal decision during, or immediately following, the oral hearing andthere may well be a delay of two or three weeks or even longer. We could ifnecessary delay our reply to such a decision for a further two or three weeks.We can therefore hope to have a minimum of about three weeks and amaximum of about six weeks from the middle of November before we need makeany definite communication to the Sub-Commission about our future participation in the proceedings. We should thus at least be able to avoid the embarrassmentof a break with the Sub-Commission during^he current session of the united nations General Assembly.United Kingdom Representation15. If the line of argument set out in paragraph 13 is to stand any chance ofsuccess it is important that the United Kingdom should be represented at the hearing on 12th November by as strong a team as possible. It is therefore considered that if the recommended course is approved, the United kingdom should be represented at Strasbourg by the Solicitor-General, and that counselshould be engaged to assist him.S.
