i(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY CF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT./*^-C.(58) 250 COPY NO.15th December, 1958CABINETOBSCENE PUBLICATIONS bill memorandum by the Lord ChancellorA Sub-Committee was appointed by the Home Affairs Committee on21st November with the following composition and terms of referenceCompositionLord Chancellor      (In the Chair)Lord PresidentChancellor of the Duchy of LancasterAttorney-GeneralLord AdvocateFinancial Secretary, TreasuryJoint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State,Home Office.Terms of Reference&quot;To consider (i) to what extent legislative effect should be given to the recommendations of the SelectCommittee on Obscene Publications;   (ii) whether,having regard both to technical and Parliamentaryconsiderations, the recently introduced obscene publications Bill (Annex A) might be modified forthis purpose;  or (iii) what alternative course shouldbe followed;  and to report. 112.      I now report on behalf of the Sub-Committee.    The subject is a difficult one, full of controversial issues, and I will not conceal the factthat on several of them the Sub-Committee was deeply divided: therecommendations which follow therefore represent, on each point, themajority opinion among us.Case for legislation.        It is by no means certain that there is any real case for legisla-tion at all.    The present agitation for statutory provision in replacement of the common law has arisen from prosecutions of novels instituted bythe Director of public Prosecutions in 1954;  but the circumstances inwhich these prosecutions were undertaken were exceptional, and both forthis reason and because the outcome showed that juries were liable toadopt a liberal attitude towards such works, it is unlikely that similarprosecutions will be undertaken in the future.    Some of us feel, however,that there would nevertheless be advantage in trying to devise a rather-1-
2mmore satisfactory definition of obscenity and in putting the law on obscene publications on a statutory basis.    Tf one thing we are satisfied: thatthe political pressures which have developed make it necessary to adopta constructive attitude towards Mr. Roy Jenkins&apos; Bill.4.        But this presents something of a dilemma.    We are ourselves in no doubt that, in certain respects referred to in later paragraphs, theBill, which is based closely on the Select Committee^ recommendations,will not do as it stands.    We believe that the modifications we regard as necessary could be effected without technical difficulty and we havebeen informed that Mr. Jenkins has expressed his willingness to co-operate in securing enactment of his Bill in a modified form - in effect, to accept any amendments for which we ask.    There are, however, certain difficulties which the following programme might meet:-(a) There is a strong body of opinion which considers thata Bill on this subject should not go to a StandingCommittee without a Second Reading debate.As the Bill has been introduced under the TenMinute Rule it is not easy to guarantee suchdebate.(b) The Chief Whip might be asked whether there is a chance of sufficient time for -debate on a Fridaysoon after the Christmas recess.(i)   in order to allow a reasonable deployment of general arguments;(ii)  to indicate the amendments which theGovernment desire to introduce.(c) If the Cabinet agree with the line suggested by this sub-Committee, and the Leader of the House andthe Chief Whip think that the time can be found,the Lord Privy Seal could inform the House thatthe Government would adopt the programme whichI suggest.If some such course is impracticable we have reached the conclusionthat it would be better to let the Bill go into Committee without debatethan to do nothing.Recommendations of the Select Committee5.        These are set out in full in Annex B.    The first three areconcerned, in effect, with a statutory definition of obscene matter and we regard them as broadly acceptable.    The Attorney-General dissents,however, from the view that we should accept the third recommendation -&quot;that the effect of a work as a whole should be considered&quot; or, as weshould prefer to express it, &quot;the effect of the matter in its context&quot;.It is arguable that this could open the way to pornography by enablingobscene passages or pictures to be included in works otherwiseunobjectionable, but we believe nevertheless that the principle of therecommendation is essentially sound and practical.    We therefore propose
that (in place of the first five lines of clause 1 of Mr. Jenkins1 Dill) thestatutory definition of obscenity should run as follows:-&quot;For the purposes of this Act any matter shall bedeemed to be obscene if its effect in its context is suchas to tend to deprave or corrupt or further to depraveor corrupt those persons who are likely to read, hearor see it.&quot;In determining what persons are likely to read,hear or see it, regard shall be had to the circumstances in which the matter was found and to the manner in whichit was proposed to be or was published. &quot;6.        We have found more difficulty over the recommendation that a defence of literary or artistic merit should be afforded than over any other.We are all agreed that a defence in these terms is unacceptable: anessentially obscene book is not less obscene because of its literary merit.Some of us indeed think it neither necessary nor desirable to afford any form of special defence:  it is unlikely that reputable works would be prosecuted and the provision of any special defence might make it moredifficult to secure the successful prosecution of &quot;high class&quot; pornography.Those of us who favour a special defence are divided on whether it shouldbe one of good faith, or of the public good or public interest.    It may be argued that the first would automatically bring in the question of literaryor artistic merit and that the second is too vague to be workable.    On theother hand, there are strong political grounds for adopting some form ofspecial defence.    The Society of Authors set much store by it and mightwell reject as wholly unsatisfactory any proposal which did not include some provision of this kind and so open the door to the admission of expert evidence.    This would lose us much of the advantage oflegislation.7.        We do not agree with the Select Committee&apos;s view that, in orderto secure uniformity in the administration of the law, the consent of theDirector of Public Prosecutions should be required for the initiation of proceedings.    Uniformity is already achieved in practice by informalconsultation between the police and the Director, but if some more formalarrangement were adopted the Director could not avoid having regard, on each occasion, to the results of previous cases and every unsuccessfulprosecution would therefore lead to a progressive lowering of standards.8.        The remaining recommendations of the Select Committee are ofa minor or relatively uncontroversial nature and our views on theseare contained in Annex B.conclusion.        We invite   the Cabinet -(i)      to agree that, if satisfactory assurances can be obtainedfrom Mr. Roy 3&quot;enkins that he will move or support in Committee the amendments desired by the Govern-ment in the Obscene Publications Bill, an attempt-3-S EC RET
should be made to secure the procedure set out inparagraphs 4(b) and (c) above or if that is unobtainable,the Bill should no longer be blocked on Second Reading;and if this is agreed,(ii)   to agree that the amendments to be proposed to Mr. Jenkinsshould be those required to give effect to the recommenda-tions in this report and Annex B, and to decide whether we should also propose a provision for some form ofspecial defence (paragraph 6).K.Lord Chancellor^ Department, S.W.1.15th December, 1950.-4

ANNEX BRECOMMENDATIONS CF THE SELECTCOMMITTEE(i)     That the test of obscenity to be applied in any statutory-definition should begin with the words &quot;whether the mattertends to deprave and corrupt&quot;.(ii)     That the class of persons liable to be depraved and corruptedshould be defined in accordance with the explanation of thelaw contained in R. v. Seeker (Annex C).(iii)     That the effect of a work as a whole should be considered.With some modifications of detail we recommend that these beaccepted (paragraph 5).(iv)    That a defence of literary or artistic merit should be afforded.We dlscu:?3 ?.hif; In paragraph 6.(v)    That an author should have a right to be heard in criminal proceedings if he is not already a party;  and that he shouldhave a similar right, and a right of appeal in proceedings under the Obscene Publications Act, 1857.We do not think that the first part of this recommendation shouldbe accepted.    The author will normally be joined as a co-defendant where he is known.    Where he is not so joined, the case for the defence mightbe prejudiced by his intervention.    We see no reason, however, why the author, and indeed the publisher as well, should not have a right to be heard in destruction proceedings under the -bscene Publications Act, 185? andthe right of appeal in such proceedings.(vi)    That a defence should be afforded to publishers on the linesof the proviso to Section 2(i) of the Children and YoungPersons (Harmful Publications) Act, 1955.This proviso affords a defence to a person &quot;selling or letting onhire&quot; a work if he can prove that he had not examined the contents of awork and had no reasonable cause to suspect that it was one to which theAct applied.    In our view this defence should be available not only tobooksellers, but to circulating libraries as well, and we therefore thinkthat Clause 5 of the Obscene Publications Bill should be extended to anyperson engaged in distributing.(vii)    PenaltiesThe penalties recommended by the Select Committee are:-&quot;On summary conviction a fine not exceeding  100 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding four months;  on conviction on indictment a fine not exceeding  2,000 or-5-
SECRETimprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or bothsuch fine and imprisonment. &quot;We think that there should be no limit to the amount of the finewhich might be imposed on conviction on indictment; the penalty of imprisonment cannot be imposed on companies, nor are they likely to be deterred by the fines recommended by the Select Committee.    On summary conviction we recommend that the maxima should be  500 and six months.(viii)    That the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutionsshould be required for tue initiation of proceedings.Wc i&apos;3 com mend that this be rejected (paragraph 7).(ix)    That the trial court should be empowered to make thenecessary destruction orders in the case of a successful prosecution.A trial court could hardly be expected to examine material notexhibited in the prosecution proceedings.    But Clause 2 of the Billinterprets the recommendation in the limited sense that the court should beempowered to order the forfeiture of any seized works identical with anexhibit.     This is       ^ptftble.(x)    That the Obscene Publications Act, 1857 should be amended by omitting the requirement of proof of sale.(xi)    That warrants under the Obscene Publications Act, 1S57should give power to seize documents relating to thebusiness.(xii)    That warrants under the Obscene Publications Act, 1857should enable stails and vehicles to be searched.(xiii)    That the law relating to obscene publications should beconsolidated incorporating the preceding recommendations.We regard these as acceptable.-6*&quot;
ANNEX C&quot;Remember the charge is a charge that the tendency of the bookis to corrupt and deprave.    The charge is not that the tendency of thebook is either to shock or to disgust.    That is not a criminal offence.Then you say:  *Well, corrupt or deprave whom?&quot; and again the test:those whose minds are open to su-:)- immoral influences and into whosehands a publication of this sort may fall.    What, exactly, does thatmean?    A--e we to take our literary standards as being the level of some-thing that i&apos;j suitable for a fourteen-year-old schoolgirl?    Or do we goeven further back than that, and are we to be reduced to the sort of booksthat one reads as n child in the rv-vsery?    The answer to that is:  Ofcourse not.    A mess of literature, great literature, from many anglesis wholly unsuitable for reading by the adolescent, but that does not mean that the publisher is guilty of a criminal offence for making those worksavailable to the general public. &quot;
