Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1958C. (58) 253 Copy No.17th December, 1958CABINETBRITISH ALUMINIUM company memorandum by the Economic Secretary, treasury the purpose of this paper is to report developments since the Cabinet last considered the affairs of the British Aluminium Company (B.A.C.) on 4th December, 1958 (C.C. (58) 83rd Conclusions, Minute 4). I do not recommendany action by the Government at this stage.B.A.C.&apos;s Letter to Shareholders2. On 5th December, Lord Portal, the Chairman of B.A.C., addressed a letterto all shareholders. He explained the Company&apos;s need for new capital and the steps it had taken to associate with the aluminium Company of America (Alcoa).The agreement would give it access to the capital needed for its development programme, while leaving its Board and Management just as free as in the past tocarry out its plans. He argued that, notwithstanding that the rival offer wouldgive Tube Investments (T.I.) a 51 per cent, holding, they had no experience of running an international aluminium complex; hence &quot; it was inevitable that thereal functions of management would fall into the hands of Reynolds Metalsalone so that B.A.C. would become merely a subsidiary instrument of that Group.&quot;B.A.C.&apos;s Representations to the Treasury3.  Lord Portal called on me on 11th December to say that (a) many of the staff and workers of B.A.C. were opposed to the take-over byT.I., and there would be a great number of resignations (including thoseof the present Board) if the bid succeeded;(b) by taking no action on either proposal, the Government were in effecttaking sides against B.A.C. because they were enabling to go forward a take-over bid which the Board&apos;s agreement with Alcoa was designedto prevent.The Tube Investments Offer4. T.I. have now made their offer to B.A.C. shareholders direct one T.I.share and 78s. cash for every two B.A.C. shares equivalent to about 78s. for eachB.A.C. share. The offer closes on 9th January, or may be extended to 9th February,and is subject to (a) 90 per cent, acceptances, or such lesser proportion as T.I. may determine;(b) T.I. may cancel the offer if B.A.C. have entered into any contracts, apartfrom normal trading contracts, this year (this arises mainly from B. A.C.&apos;sconditional contract with Alcoa).5. T.I.&apos;s letter covering the offer is primarily concerned with convincingB.A.C. shareholders that it is to their financial advantage, both immediately andas far ahead as can be foreseen.  The letter also deals with questions of control54473THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT
and finance. It argues that the proposed arrangements with Alcoa would confereffective control upon an American company, whereas acceptance of the T.I. offer would ensure control in the United Kingdom. It says that finance for futured development will be provided on terms which will not remove control from the^ United Kingdom, and concludes that the link with Reynolds Metal Company andt, i, T.I. &quot; will result in a very strong aluminium unit within the British commonwealth and under United Kingdom control which should be well able to match the competitive conditions in world markets.&quot;conclusion. The choice between the two proposals is now with the ordinaryshareholders. Many would say that is as it should be. In any case, I suggestthat the Government, having refrained from expressing a view so far, shouldcontinue to do so until the shareholders&apos; response, is known. At some point, weshall have to give a decision on the two applications before us. How difficult thatdecision will be will depend very largely on the shareholders&apos; response. an overwhelming acceptance of the T.I. offer would make the decision a comparativelyeasy matter; a half acceptance would leave us with a difficult question still to answer.F. J. E.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,17th December, 1958.
