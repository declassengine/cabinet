secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1958C. (58) 203 Copy No.1st October, -1958CABINETFUEL AND STEEL : EFFECT OF THE RECESSIONMemorandum by the Minister of power the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation has circulated a Paper(C. (58) 193) on the effects of the recession on transport, and I think my colleagues will be interested in the evidence of similar repercussions on some of the industries for which I am responsible.2. The total demand by industrial consumers for energy (coal, coke, oil,electricity and gas) fell, in terms of coal equivalent, from 105 - 3 million tons in 1956to 104-5 million in 1957, and is thought likely to fall further to 100 million in 1958. Although part of this reduction in demand is due to the more efficient use of fuel, it undoubtedly reflects the decline in industrial activity, beingparticularly marked in iron and steel, textiles, bricks arid cement industries.3. The consumption of electricity and oil has actually increased, the reductionin demand for energy being concentrated largely in the coal industry. This industry has also been hit by the fall in their export trade which is now only half of what it was in 1956. The total demand for coal for all purposes has fallen from228 million tons in 1956 to about 210 million tons in 1958. The National coal board finds itself, therefore, in a similar position to the British transport commission for, despite the Board&apos;s efforts to reduce their costs by restrictingrecruitment, ending general Saturday working and closing uneconomic pits, thereduction in consumption is having adverse effects on the financial position ofthe Board.4. The decline in industrial activity is having a serious effect in respect ofsteel requirements. I attach, as an Appendix, a memorandum submitted to me by the Chairman of the British Iron and Steel Federation. This shows the rapidcontraction that is taking place in the steel industry&apos;s output and order books. Inthe second quarter of this year output was 10 per cent, below the correspondingperiod last year and is still sinking, only 73 per cent, of the industry&apos;s capacitybeing now in use; orders have been reduced from 8-06 million tons in June 1956,to 6-36 million tons in June 1957, and to 3-76 million tons in June 1958. In thelight of these trends the Federation are asking the Government to take steps to accelerate both public and private investment..:     M.Ministry of Power, S.W. 1,30th September^ 1958.54122
APPENDIXMEMORANDUM BY BRITISH IRON AND STEEL FEDERATIONPresent Position of the Steel Industry and the Necessity for an Expansion of theEconomyFall in output of steel during 19581. In the first quarter of 1958 as compared with the corresponding period of1957, output of steel was reduced by 1 per cent., in the second quarter by 10 per cent.,in July by 13 per cent., and in August by 20 per cent. In March 1958 95 per cent, ofthe industry&apos;s steel-making capacity was in use. After making allowance for normalseasonal influences the use of steel-making capacity was reduced to 82 per cent, inJune, and to 73 per cent, in August. \During 1958 the demand for the products of the wide strip mills, particularlysheet has substantially been maintained. The use of the industry&apos;s other steel-making capacity has, in fact, declined from 94 per cent, in March to 79 per cent, in June, andto 67 per cent, in August.The foregoing facts show that the position of the industry has rapidly worsenedduring the year, and that it is now extremely serious.2. It is evident from the industry&apos;s order book that a further decline in tradeis inevitable. At.the end of June 1957 the order book represented 17  weeks&apos; work at the rate of delivery in the second quarter, compared with more than 20 weeks at mid-1956. At the end of June 1958 the order book represented 11 weeks&apos; work atthe rate of delivery in the second quarter. Since June orders have declined stillfurther. Total orders fell from 8-06 million tons in June .1956 to 6-36 million tonsin June 1957 and to 3 -76 million tons in June 1958-, For the first time since the warthe industry has less than one quarters work on the books, and many of these ordersfor future delivery are being cancelled. Unless there is a substantial increase in new orders a further reduction in output is inevitable.3. Steel production has been reduced and every major steel producing country has steel-making capacity standing unused. Imports are being reduced particularlyin the primary producing countries. The recession is much more serious than thatof 1953-54 in many countries. The decline in world trade in manufactures isaccelerating. The prospects for exports of steel and of manufactures containing steelare not good.The prospects for the Steel Consuming Industries4. An inquiry into industrial trends made by the Federation of BritishIndustries in June disclosed that companies in manufacturing industry weremarkedly less optimistic as to their future prospects. A great majority of thecompanies were working below capacity. A more recent inquiry made by theNational Institute of Economic Research showed that metal-using industries otherthan shipbuilding were working at only 80 per cent, of capacity. Capital goodsindustries are particularly affected, as is confirmed by the experience of the steelindustry, where the most recent decline in orders has been in heavy steel, particularlyheavy sections and plates. A survey by the Board of Trade forecasts a decline in investment by private manufacturing industry of 15 per cent, in 1959 as comparedwith 1958, and a 25 per cent, decline in building.Government Policy5. The Government measures taken to stimulate the economy have only very recently extended beyond a removal of the restrictions imposed in September1957. In the view of the industry these measures are insufficient particularly onthe investment side. Moreover, they are likely to increase the demand for sheet,which is the only section of the industry now fully extended, and they are notcalculated to stimulate those sectors of the economy where the difficulties aregreatest. It is suggested that over a wide field of industry, including iron andsteel and other capital goods industries, substantial expansion could be encouragedwithout inflationary pressures or shortages.
Further action necessary6. The industry appreciates that it is for the Government to decide what arethe appropriate steps to take to remedy the present very serious situation. It is,however, submitted that public investment should no longer be limited, and that immediate steps should be taken to accelerate those programmes e.g., for therailways and roads which hold out some prospect of cost saving to the rest ofthe economy. These measures, by keeping resources in employment and maintaining consumer incomes, would assist in steadying consumer demand, and indirectly assist private investment which is at present declining. It is also suggested that the investment allowance should be restored as soon as possible.The restoration of the investment allowance would stimulate investment for expansion, and make possible more modernisation, a reduction of costs and improvement in services and products.Urgency of position7. Steel production in 1958 may not reach the level of steel production in1955. In the three years following 1955 the industry has spent  280 millions at1957 prices on the development of further capacity. The jndustry plans to spendover  400 millions on development in the next four years. The development planhas been geared to an expected expansion of the economy and should not be frustrated. Immediate action to stimulate the economy and to encourage capital investment is required to prevent the waste implicit in the failure to use fully theindustrial capacity of the country.26th September, 1958.
