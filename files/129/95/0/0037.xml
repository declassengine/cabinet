-I goC.(58) 237 COPY NO.18th November, 1958CABINETLOCAL, GOVERNMENT; general grant FCR ENGLAND AND wales memorandum by the Minister of Housing andLocal Government and Minister for Welsh affairs attach the draft of a White Paper on the general grant for england and Wales for the two financial years 1959-60 and 1960-61,subject to any further necessary drafting revisions.   The formalOrder which accompanies the White Paper , and which requiresaffirmative resolution, must be laid at the beginning of next week in order to be debated early in December.2.      I have reached agreement with the Chancellor of the exchequer that the total of grant shall be  393 millions for 1959-60 and 414 millions for 1960-61.3.     When this new system was initiated by the Local government act, 1958, suspicion of the purpose was freely expressed, not onlyin quarters politically prejudiced.   It was widely feared that part of the tax burden would be shifted on to rates.   The table inparagraph 15 of the draft White Paper brings out clearly howunfounded are these fears.   As required by the Act, I have heldconsultations with the local authorities on the figures;  and though they will naturally say that they would have liked a little more,it is clear that, broadly speaking, they regard the proposals as reasonable.4.     The text of the White Paper (subject to any minor draftingimprovements) is, so far as I am aware, acceptable to all theMinisters who are directly concerned.   As there is not likely to bea further meeting of the Cabinet before it has to be published, I have obtained the authority of the Prime Minister to circulate it to mycolleagues, without need for bringing it to the Cabinet;  if they have any comments, I shall be grateful if they will let me have them bymidday on Thursday, 20th November.H.B.Ministry of Housing andLocal Government, S.W.1.18th November, 1958(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
CONFIDENTIALANITEXDRAFT WHITE paper the GENERAL GRANTS FOR 1959-60 AND 1960-61FOR ENGLAND AND WALESAo      The Total of the General GrantBGeneral RequirementsSection 1 of the Local Government Act, 1958, providesthat there shall for each year he a prescribed aggregateamount of the general grants, determined by Order made by theMinister of Housing and Local Government with the consent ofthe Treasury and after consultation with such associations oflocal authorities as appear to him to be concerned and withany local authority with whom consultation appears to him tobe desirable.     The Order has to be laid before the House ofCommons, together with a report by the Minister explaining the considerations leading to the provisions of the Order;and it does not have effect until approved by a resolution ofthe House.     General Grant Orders are required to be made inadvance for successive periods of not less than two years, butan Order may make different provision for different years inthe grant period.2. The Government propose that the first General Grant order should be for the two financial years 1959-60 and 1960-61, andshould provide for different amounts of general grant for eachof these years.Considerations to be taken into account in Fixing the AnnualAggregate of the General Grant3.     By Section 2 of the Act of 1958 the Minister in fixing theannual aggregate amount to be prescribed is required to take into consideration:-(a)    the latest information available to him of the rate of relevant expenditure (excluding, except in so far as theMinister with the consent of the Treasury otherwise determines,-1-
any expenditure of a description in respect of which nogrant has been paid for years before the year 1959-60), andthe current level of prices, costs and remuneration,together with any future variation in that level which can before seen;(b) any probable fluctuation in the demand for the servicesgiving rise to relevant expenditure so far as the fluctuationis attributable to circumstances prevailing in England andWales as a whole which are not under the control of localauthorities;(c) the need for developing those services and the extent towhich, having regard to general economic conditions, it is reasonable to develop those services.The Current Sate of expenditure +.     During the autumn of 1957 local authorities, in thenormal course, submitted to Government Departments estimates of their relevant expenditure in 1958-59, on which the amountsincluded in the Votes of the several Departments were based.These estimates were, if necessary, revised by the localauthorities for the purposes of making their rates for1958-59 and in some cases were further revised subsequently.These revised estimates constitute the latest available information of the current rate of relevant expenditure.They aggregate to a figure of  644.1 millions.     The aggregateamount of the specific grants corresponding to this level of-2-
-3-annual expenditure is  363*0 millions.*    For comparison, itmay be noted that when the earlier White Paper on LocalGovernment Finance was presented in July 1957 the total of the specific grants for 1956-57 to be absorbed into the general grant was then estimated at &quot;nearly  300 millions&quot;;    and,after making an adjustment for re-rating, a hypothetical totalof  291.25 millions vae taken as the   basis for   demonstrat-ing the effect of the formula&apos;in distributing the general grant.Expected Increase in expenditure .     On this occasion, for the purpose of assessing in theyears 1959-60 and 1960-61 the effect of any generalfluctuations in the demand for the services and the probabledevelopment in the services, and the effect in each year ofvariations in pay and price levels which had operated for part only of 1958-59, the individual local authorities were asked in the summer of 1958 to submit their own estimates,together with supporting particulars.     These estimatesaggregatedto an estimated expenditure of  697*1 millions in 1959-60 and  732.5 millions in 1960-61.     These figures,for 1959-60 represent an increase over 1958-59 of some.2 per cent; and those for 1960-61 represent an increase3z Throughout this Paper, in assessing totals of expenditure and grant the following procedure has been observed;(a) The grant under the National Assistance Act, 19U8, inrespect of the provision of accommodation for the aged andinfirm is by way of a unit sum and is not related to theexpenditure on the provision (mostly capital in nature).The grant is included in the figures but the expenditure is excluded.(b) Expenditure and grant on the registration of electors inthe forthcoming years has been estimated by the appropriate department;    and the local authorities were not asked tosubmit estimates for this service.(c) Expenditure on welfare services for the handicappedclasses is not at present grant aided;    but, as indicated inparagraph 11, the Government have decided that further expenditure for this purpose above the level of 1958-59should be assisted through the general grant.     The estimated expenditure under this heading vrtiich is taken into account is therefore the excess above the level of 1958-59*
&quot;beyond the same &quot;base year (1958-59) of some 13.7 per cent.6.      In preparing these returns local authorities were asked to arrive at them &quot;by their traditional processes ofassembling the proposals of the spending committees andaccepting or limiting them in accordance with the normal&quot;budgetary procedure of each authority.     They have since&quot;been examined closely in the several Departments.7*     The Government have accepted the figures returned,subject to certain modifications which represent only a verysmall proportion of the total.      In this process the modifi-cations were discussed with the local authority representa-tives, and adjustments were made in the light of their comments.     Additions were also made for certain itemsomitted.The Effect of Increased Remuneration8.     The returns were made on the basis of the level ofprices, costs and remuneration current at the date of theirmaking.     Departments have made adjustments for certain increases in remuneration which have since taken place.Certain other increases can also he foreseen and are included.Stability in the Price Level for Goods and Services9.     Nothing is included for increases in the price level ofgoods and services.     Whether or not stability is whollyachieved during the period of the grant, it is natural that public authorities will seek, as they normally do, to meetincreases &quot;by economies and that they, will constantly improve efficiency by the use of new techniques.      If it appears tothe Minister that during the grant period there has been anunforeseen increase in the level of prices, costs or remunera-tion and that the net effect on the cost of providing theservices is of such magnitude that it ought not to fallentirely on local authorities, he may by Order increase theannual aggregate amount of the grants.
CONFIDENTIALAdjustment for Increased Site Costs10,   A Bill has been introduced amending the &quot;basis for the compulsory acquisition of land.     If enacted, this amendedbasis will begin to operate from 30th October, 1958.     Theincrease in the cost of site purchase which is to be expectedto result will normally be amortised over a period.     the consequent increase in loan charges is not a figure of anymagnitude, but the necessary addition to the amount of general grant has been made.Expenditure on the Welfare of the Handicapped11.   Expenditure on welfare services for the handicappedclasses does not at present attract Exchequer assistance, butin order to promote a fuller development of these services as envisaged by the Piercy Committee (Cmnd. 9883) the Governmenthave agreed that the cost of further developing these servicesabove the present level should rank for the general grant.Accordingly, the estimated increase in expenditure above thelevel of 1958-59 is taken into&apos; account.Adjusted Estimates of Expenditure and General Grants12.    The net effect of these calculations is an estimated expenditure of  707.8 millions for 1959-60 and  7Uh,3 millions for 1960-61.     Some further details of these figures are contained in the Appendix.     Compared with the percentagesmentioned in paragraph 5, the figure for 1959-60 is an increase over 1958-59 of about 9.9 per cent while that for 1960-61 isan increase over the same year of 15.6 per cent.     On thebasis of these figures, the corresponding total of specific grants would, if re-rating and the 1958 Act were ignored, be 399.9 millions for 1959-60 and  U20.5 millions for 1960-61.13.    The proceeds of re-rating, estimated in total at 30 millions a year (see the White Paper Cmnd, 209,paragraphs 26-30), are to be divided between the Exchequer andlocal authorities.     That part which will accrue to theExchequer is  20 millions.      13i millions of this will comeautomatically from a reduction in rate deficiency grants andfrom the abolition of small grants, but the remaining 6.75 millions falls to be deducted from the total of thegeneral grant in each of the two years.-5-CONFBDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL &apos;       1891k.   In these circumstances the Government have concluded thaton this occasion the total of the general grant should he 393 millions for 1959-60 and  h1h millions for 1960-61.Oonvparative Figures of Grants over the Years15.   Much of the increase in grants in earlier years was attributable to increases in the prices for goods and services,which should not arise in the years Immediately ahead.     Inpercentage terms the grants proposed (when account is taken ofthe effect of re-rating in benefiting local authorities by 10 millions) compare favourably with those for earlier years,as the following figures show:-135ks55   1955-56 1956-57 1957-58 1258-59   1959-6,0 1960-61 *  t &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;millions millions millions millions millions millions millionsExpenditureor estimated expenditure     1+17.9 h5h*7 528.0 592.6 6kh.1 707.8 7U4.3Grant              232.

In due course the Government propose to pay the full amount of the general grant for each year within that year,reaching this position by stages which must take account of theincreased burden which the charge will throw upon the budget ascompared with present arrangement.     At the beginning of thefirst grant period there will be substantial unpaid arrears ofthe specific grants now to be superseded.     These arrears will besettled and paid as speedily as practicable.     In 1959-60 theGovernment will pay 90 per cent of the general grant for thatyear;    and the remaining 10 per cent in the succeeding year.In 1960-61 it will be 91.25 per cent, and the remaining 8.75 percent in the succeeding year.
Development of the Services17.   The provision made in the general grant takes full account of the need for further development of the servicesand in certain directions for the acceleration of fartherdevelopment.     Throughout the services the requisite capitalprovision based on the investment programme has &quot;been takeninto account.     The following notes draw attention to some of theprincipal features.Development in Education18.    In education, the number of pupils in the primary schools is expected to fall, and this will make it possibleto reduce the size of classes in these schools.     There willbe an increase in the roll of the secondary schools whichwill more than offset this fall;    and the main task here will he to maintain and where possible improve standardswhile providing for the additional children.     The need toprovide suitable courses for the increasing number ofchildren staying on at school after the age of fifteen, andthe &quot;bringing into use of many new school ouildings, will call for higher expenditure, while the volume of new school buildings to be started will increase.     The policy of developing the special school system will be continued, withparticular emphasis on the provision of day schools for theeducationally sub-normal.7-
19.   The publication of the 1956 White Paper (Crand. 9703)sets new targets for the development of Technical Education,The designation of eight colleges as colleges of advanced technology, and the award of the first Diplomas of Technologyunder the auspices of the Hives Council have drawn attentionto the successes already achieved.     Substantial further developments, particularly in increasing the number of studentsattending advanced full-time and sandwich courses, and ofthese released for part-time instruction, are planned for thenext two years.     The higher rates of awards recommended bythe last triennial review will apply generally during thefinancial years 1959-60 and 1960-61, while the numbers of awards will increase as the Universities expand and thenumber of full-time courses in technical colleges grows.20.   Virtually all important developments in education dependon maintaining an adequate supply of teachers of the highest possible quality.     The estimates provide for an increased number of students in the training colleges during the grantperiod.     Ambitious plans for the further expansion of thetraining colleges to enable the training to be lengthenedand improved without reducing recruitment to the professionhave already been announced, but will begin to make them-selves felt in increased educational expenditure only towardsthe end of the period.     It has been assumed that netrecruitment of teachers during each of the two years will fall within the limits suggested by the National AdvisoryCouncil on the Training and Supply of Teachers.-8-
Developments in the Local Health Services21.    Similar substantial further development of the local health authority services is provided for, especially in thefield of mental health.22.    Following the recommendations of the Royal Commissionon the Lav/ relating to Mental Illness and Mental Deficiency(Cmnd. 169) and their acceptance by the Government, it isexpected that far greater responsibilities for the care ofmentally disordered persons will devolve upon the local health authorities.     There is a need to provide residential accommodation in homes and hostels for patients who may needresidential care but do not need, or no longer need, treatment as hospital in-patients;    to increase the number ofoccupation and training centres for both children and adultsand to make some of them residential;      and to expand thecommunity care services generally.     Taking this into account,the estimates as a whole allow for an annual rate of develop-ment in the mental health field in each of the years 1959&quot;60and 1960-61 at roughly two and. a half times the rate whichhas obtained in recent years.23.     Another service of particular social significance,in view of the ageing population, is the DomesticHelp Service.      An effective domestic help servicereduces the demand for hospital beds and for accommodation in local authority welfare homes.    .  It is estimatedthat expenditure on this service will increase byabout 8.5 per cent in 1959^60 and by 13 per cent in 1960-61over the 1958-59 level.     The number of staff employed (i.e.,staff employed on a whole-time basis plus the whole-timeequivalent of staff engaged on a part-time basis) is expectedto rise from just under 22,000 at 31st December, 1958 to nearly24,500 by 31st December, i960.-9-
2L\.*   Provision is also made for improved or additionalwelfare centres for mothers and young children;    for increases in the numbers of midwives, health visitors and home nurses;and for the expanded anti-poliomyelitis vaccinationprogramme announced in the House of Commons on 21st July, 1958*Developments in Residential accommodation for the aged andinfirm provided under the National Assistance Act, 19U825.   Another important part of current social policy is theprovision of residential accommodation for the aged and infirm.It is estimated that since 191+8 just under 30,000 placesranking for contribution will have &quot;been brought into use inhomes by the end of the current financial year, and that thenumber will be increased to 33,000 &quot;by 31st March, i960.Allowance has also been made for a still further substantial increase by 31st March, 1961.Developments in Welfare Services for the Handicapped underSection 29 of the National Assistance Act, 19U826.   The Piercy Committee (Cmnd. 9883) found that, with theexception of services for the blind, there was room for considerable expansion in the services provided for handicappedpersons.     The estimates now accepted allow for the provision,&quot;by 31st December, i960, of services for an additional 5,000(I4..3 per cent) blind and partially sighted persons, anadditional 3,000 (9.5 per cent) deaf and hard of hearingpersons, and an additional 16,000 (25.5 per cent) personshandicapped for other reasons.Developments in Child Care27.   Provision has been made for an increase proportionate to the expected increase in the population under the age of eighteen,in the numbers of children in care.     Allowance has been madefor additional help to foster parents, with a view to thefurther development of boarding out, and for continuedprogress in improving existing children&apos;s homes, replacing
large and unsuitable homes by small family group homes, andsecuring that the service is adequately staffed.     Theimmediate effect of these developments may be a temporary increase in expenditure, but the ultimate result should bea saving in the cost of the service as a whole.Development of the Fire Services28,   Some increases in man-power establishments for the fire services are contemplated in the years under review.     Steady-progress in other parts of the service has been allowed for.Development of School Crossing Patrols29*   Further provision is made for school crossing patrols.An increase of 1+50 in the number of patrols in 1959-60 andof a further 300 in 196O-6I is contemplated, as compared with8,045 patrols at present.Development of Police Traffic Patrols and Road Safety30.   The provision for police traffic patrols envisagesgreater mileages for cars and motor-cycles.     More localauthorities will be engaged in training schemes for road safety, with special attention to child cyclists.Development of Planning31.   Planning (apart from blitz redevelopment, which continuesas a specific grant) is mainly concerned with the redevelopmentof areas of obsolete development or bad layout.     Up to march, 1958 the main project had been Birmingham&apos;s long-standing redevelopment scheme affecting over 900 acres ofslum and obsolete industrial development.     Proposals were however being prepared elsewhere for inclusion in the firstquinquennial review of development plans.     In 1957-58 and1958-59 approximately 300 acres and 1+00 acres respectivelyhave been or are expected to be acquired.     1959-60 should see the acquisition of a further 600 acres, while 1960-61 isexpected to show substantial progress on some of the larger-11-
19?schemes, leading to acquisitions totalling over 1,750 acres.Steady progress has also been allowed for in the provision ofpublic open space:    the 1959-60 programme allows for anincrease of approximately 20 per cent and that of 1960-61about 50 per cent over 1953-59.B.     The Formula for DistributionGeneral32.   The formula set out in Appendix C of the earlier white paper (Cmnd. 209) was designed to illustrate the distributionof a total grant of  291.25 millions (which was related tothe amount for 1956-57 of specific grants to be absorbed inthe general grant).     The weightings of the various factors in the formula need to be altered to take account of largertotals, as well as for any desirable improvements.Improvements in the Formula33.    The formula has been re-examined with the associations of local authorities in the light of suggestions for improvement made in Parliament and elsewhere.     Two of these suggestions concern the supplementary grant which is paidwhere the number of school children and children attendingoccupation centres exceed a prescribed proportion of thepopulation.     One suggestion was to the effect that theweighting assumed in the White Paper ( 0.06 per head of population multiplied by the number by which pupils per 1,000population exceed 120) was relatively too high.     The othersuggestion was that the qualifying proportion of 120 childrenper 1,000 population should be reduced so as to secure thatall authorities received this grant (only five failed to qualify for it in the White Paper exemplification).     Thefactor of rate product deduction in the formula has also received much attention.
CONFIDENTIAL *        1983k*   The examination of the formula has shown that in a modification of the formula to meet the above pointsdesirable improvements can be secured provided they arcaccompanied by a small modification in the supplementarygrant for low density.35*   The following proposals for 1959-60 and 1960-61 (the1960-61 figures, where different, are given in brackets)result from these considerations.     They are designed to distribute sums of  393 millions for 1959-60 and  l+lh, millions for 1960-61.(a) Basic grant  5*75 ( 6.05) per head of population;plus  0.52 ( 0.54) for each child under fifteen.(b) Supplementary grants(i)    Young children and old people  0.2+2 ( 0.1+3)for each child under five and each personover sixty-five,(ii)    Schoolchildren, etc.  C.O58 ( 0.06) per head of population multiplied by thenumber of pupils etc., per 1,000population in excess of 110.(iii)   High density.     A percentage of the basicgrant being one-half of the amount by whichthe number of persons per acre exceedseighteen.(iv)    Low density.     A percentage of the basicgrant payable where road mileage exceedstwo per 1,000 population;    the percentagebeing 2-J times the road mileage per 1,000population, with a maximum of 70 per cent.
(v)   Declining -population.     A percentage of the basic grant being half the amount by whichthe decline in population over the pasttwenty-one years exceeds 5 per cent.(vi)    High cost in the metropolitan district.5 per cent of the basic grant to authoritieswholly or partly in the metropolitan district.(c)    Rate Product Deduction.     A rate of 9d. in the  .Amount Receivable by Individual County and County BoroupfttCouncils &quot; &quot; &apos;     &quot;    *36*   A separate paper is being prepared shewing the shareof each county and county borough council in the total ofthe general grant for 1959-60.     These will be provisionalsums, calculated upon data of population, schoolchildren,etc., at the latest available dates.     They will also fall to be adjusted under Part IV of the First Schedule of theAct in respect of the pooling of certain categories ofexpenditure, and under Section 15 in respect of the transitional scheme contributions.     Details of theseadjustments are not yet finally settled.     The actual grants for 1959-60 will finally be determined on data of population,etc., for June, 1959 and January, I960.-1h-
