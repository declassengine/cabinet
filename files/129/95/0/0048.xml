THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTINTEGRATION OF N.A.T.O. AIR defence memorandum by the Minister of defence on 26th November, 1958, the Defence Committee invited me,incconsultation with the Foreign Secretary, to give further considerationto the means whereby proposals of the Supreme Allied CommanderEurope (SACEUR) for the integration of the air defence of N.A.T.O.Europe could be presented to the North Atlantic Council in a form which would not expose the Government to political embarrasment in this country.2.   In considering our attitude towards this proposal, the factorsset out below should be taken into account -(a) At present the air defence forces of N.A.T.O, countries are under national control, though SACEUR is charged with the task ofco-ordinating them.   He has found that the present arrangements do not provide him with the necessary control to secure an effective air defence system in Western Europe.(b) Having regard to the speed of modern aircraft and the need fora continuous chain of early warning stations, the air defence of western Europe needs to be organised on an integrated basis.(c) The only authority through whom this system could be organisedis SACEUR.(d) In order to discharge this responsibility, SACEUR must havethe power to plan, organise, and test the air defence system in timeof peace and to direct its operations in time of war or imminentthreat of war.(e) Since, in the sphere of air defence, the transition from peace towar may take only a matter of minutes, it is necessary to confer uponSACEUR in advance the powers he would need to exercise in anemergency.(f) It is, therefore, necessary for the N.A.T.O. countries concerned to assign their air defence forces in Europe to SACEUR&apos;s command.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of.........------------------TOP secret.(58) 2489th December, 1958CABINET-1-
TOP SECRET(g) However, national interests require that certain far-reachingrestrictions should be placed by the Governments concerned upon themanner in which SACEUR shall be entitled to exercise his command&apos;.&apos;over their air defence forces.   They must, for example, reserve theright   -(i) to decide the size and equipment of theair defence forces they provide, the mannerin which they are to be deployed, and thestate of readiness at which they can bemaintained;  and(ii) to withdraw their air defence forces fromthe N.A.T.O. area,  should they consider this necessary to meet national commitmentselsewhere.(h) It is also necessary that, before SACEUR assumes command of these forces, he should agree with the Governments concerned,through the N.A.T.O. Council, precise rules and proceduresgoverning the operation of the assigned forces, with particular reference to the opening of fire.(i) The N.A.T.O, air defence system, proposed would have to be divided into regions.   Britain would constitute a separate regionon her own, under the command of the Commander-in-Chief, R.A.F.Fighter Command.3.   The paper MC 54/l (a copy of which was circulated underD. (58) 7 8), like most N.A.T.O. papers is a lengthy and obscure document.It is therefore desirable that, when the proposal is submitted to theforthcoming Ministerial Session of the Council, it should be framedin much more precise terms.4.   The Permanent Council of N.A.T.O. are at present considering this matter;  and, subject to the agreement of my colleagues, I suggestthat our representative on the Permanent Council should try and secure that the recommendation to the Ministerial Session shouldbe framed on the lines set out at the annex to this paper.D.S.Ministry of Defence, S. W.l.9th December, 1958-2-
ANNEXINTEGRATION OF AIR DEFENCE IN EUROPESugc^sted form of Resolution to besubmitted to Ministerial Session ofthe North Atlantic council the COUNCIL: Having noted the report by the military committee MC 54/l;APPROVE:  The establishment of an integrated system ofair defence for NA..T.O. Europe under the command and control ofSACEUR, on the general lines recommended by the military committee in MC 54/1.REQUEST:  The N.A.T.O. Governments concerned to assigntheir air defence forces in Europe to SACEUR, subject to:-INSTRUCT:  The Military Committee to direct the supreme allied Commander Europe, through the Standing Group:-(a) to negotiate with the N.A.T.O. Governments concerned the arrangements required to establish the above-mentioned air defence system;(b) to draft rules of engagement for the operation ofthe assigned forces for submission to the Council.(a)approval by the Council of the rules of engagementgoverning the operation of the assigned forces;(b)the provisions for safeguarding national interestsset out in paragraph 11. of MC 54/1 (see Appendix);and-3
TOP SECRET-    255APPENDIXParagraph 11 of MC 54/lResponsibilities and SafeguardsIn order to safeguard national interests and to clarifyAllied responsibilities, the following principles should be established and agreed:(a)     National air defence units assigned to SACEUR will be placed under his operational command and control in peace and war, subjectto such restriction as may be imposed^by Governments^ in respect ofemployment and deployment of forces.(b) Assigned air defence forces will not be used for tasks otherthan air defence without national approval.(c) Assigned air defence units will, in general, be deployed in national territory unless exceptions to meet overall requirementsreceive national approval.(d) The composition of Allied air defence staffs at each levelshould take into account the nationality and service of the forces and facilities contributed.(e) Control and reporting centres and stations will be mannedprimarily by the nation in whose territory they are located unlessunusual circumstances demand otherwise, and then only after approvalof the nations concerned.(f) The provision of national force contributions will follow the already established procedures (i. e. Supreme Allied Commander europe will continue to make his recommendations to the Standing Group forthe Military Committee), but the decision on the size and shape   of theforces to be provided, and their equipment, will remain as at presenta national responsibility.(g) The logistical support of assigned units will remain a nationalresponsibility.(h) Administration and discipline of personnel assigned to Alliedorganisations will remain a responsibility of the nation concerned.(i) The Allied air defence organisation will continue to provide theinformation normally supplied by national air defence authorities forall matters which remain national in character.   This will includeinformation which is necessary from military authorities for the nationalcontrol of:(1) Civil Aviation(2)  Civil Defence(3)  Other national responsibilities.-4-
(j)       Certain functions such as internal security and nationalcommitments outside of N.A.T.O., must remain a national responsibility.Should circumstances require the employment of national forces for such purposes, the necessary forces inclusive of personnel andequipment may be withdrawn from the assigned forces by the nationconcerned under the currently agreed procedures.(k)       To ensure that Allied commanders responsible for air defencehave the required degree of authority to discharge their Alliedresponsibilities, it is essential that commanders at each level beresponsible only to superior Allied authorities for matters which areAllied.   If it is essential that an Allied commander undertake certain additional administrative functions or responsibilities of a purelynational character, direction and control must be purely Allied for allied matters and purely national for national matters.(!)       The inclusion of the Faeroe Islands in Supreme AlliedCorr-iander Europe area of responsibility for air defence would be without jeopardy to the use of the facilities thereon by theSupreme Allied Commander Atlantic in pursuance of his airborne early warning and anti-submarine warfare responsibilities.   The commander of facilities in the Faeroe Islands jointly supporting the Supreme allied commander Europe and Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic, wouldhave equal responsibility to Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic inconnection with the control and direction of airborne early warningand anti-submarine warfare operations as he has to the Supreme allied commander Europe in connection with the integrated air defence.-5-
