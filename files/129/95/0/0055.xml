secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1958C. (58) 25518th December, 1958CABINETINVESTMENT PROGRAMME : 1959-60 AND 1960-61Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the object of this paper is to set out for my colleagues the main features ofpublic sector investment in the two years 1959-60 and 1960-61, as amended inthe light of the decisions taken last July and during recent weeks as part of our general reflationary action.2. It is now necessary to settle finally the total for 1959-60 as well as thefigures for individual programmes.3. As regards 1960-61 (with which this paper is mainly concerned), it isnecessary to determine the total for public sector investment as well as the limits for individual programmes. As most investment takes a long time to fructify,decisions made now about investment in 1960-61 will largely govern the pattern of investment in that year. Although we shall have another opportunity next summer to take final decisions for 1960-61 (as well as take provisional ones for later years) I must ask my colleagues to do their utmost to see that the limits setout in the accompanying table are observed when individual propositions are put by Departments to the Treasury.Economic Background4. In the past year we have gone far to overcome the serious internal and external dangers which the currency faced in the autumn of 1957. We must make as certain as we can that the measures which we have rightly taken to offset thedownturn in certain sectors of the economy do not undermine the progress wehave made.5. The particular dangers I have in mind in the context of public investmentare those to which I referred in the Debate on the Address on 3rd November, viz.,&quot; .... we must be aware of the danger of making a mistake which hasbeen made before, that is, embarking upon expansions of public investmentwithout fully weighing the likelihood that by the time the programmes cometo fruition they may be overloading the economy.&quot; We must be careful to avoid excessive expansion here which would absorb resources building and engineering capacity and savings in twoor three years&apos; time^ which may well by then be heeded to support the nextwave of industrial development.&quot;6. It is highly desirable that, once programmes for public sector investmenthave been settled, subsequent alterations should be as small as possible, sinceshort-term chopping and changing make for inefficiency. But if we are to getreasonably close to achieving this objective, it would be most imprudent to getcommitted now to public sector investment for 1960-61 (and for later years) onCopy No.6254476
a scale which might well then stimulate inflation, forcing us either to stifle theexpansion of private industrial investment upon which we are relying, or toundertake yet another series of emergency cuts in public investment.7. We may find, when the time comes to take final decisions next summer,that refiationary action is needed for 1960-61. This is where the relatively fast-moving programmes are important. In housing and in educational minor worksit will then be possible to provide an increase in 1960-61. For practical purposes in this paper I have included these at minimum levels, subject to re-considerationnext summer if we then find that a higher total of public sector investment for1960-61 is appropriate then than is now envisaged.Total Public Sector Investment8. The total for public sector investment in 1957-58 is now estimated to havebeen  1,430 millions. In the present year, 1958-59, the total is put at  1,465 millions in round figures.9. The total envisaged for 1959-60 is now  1,585 millions. Our decisionslast July (C.C. (58) 64th Conclusions, Minute 4) were for  1,500 millions, whichwas itself  75 millions higher than had been planned in the previous autumn. Asa result of the measures which we have taken, public sector investment in 1959-60will be over  150 millions more than last year more, indeed, than the upper limit which I announced to the House of Commons on 3rd November. We have certainly gone as far as we should at the present time.10. For 1960-61 the Cabinet in July approved my proposal to containinvestment within an increase of  150 millions over 1958-59 i.e., a figure of around 1,580 millions. I was invited to examine the investment programmes with thedepartments accordingly. I append a list which adds up to  1,595-  1,600 millions:this, as I have explained in paragraph 7 above, subject to any additions which maylater prove to be appropriate to the relatively fast-moving programmes (housing and educational minor works) here included at &quot; minimum &quot; figures.11. This figure of  1,595- 1,600 millions for 1960-61 is certainly the most wecan now contemplate it is in fact higher than the hope I expressed to the House ofCommons that public investment in 1960-61 would not rise above the 1959-60 level.Prices12. Some of my colleagues may wish to know how future price increasesmight affect these limits. I would prefer to leave this question until we examinethe public sector investment again next summer. I would of course be willingto examine any exceptional cases on their merits before then.THE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMMES13. The detailed figures for individual programmes are set out in theaccompanying table. All the figures have been discussed between the department concerned and the Treasury; those for 1959-60 have been agreed in nearly all cases.As regards 1960-61, the individual figures have been agreed subject to the points noted in the remainder of this paper.Atomic Energy Authority14. The Authority&apos;s programme is partly geared to military requirements and partly to those of the electricity industry, although there is a substantial partdevoted to its own research and development activities. At the present time its programme is in a state of flux due to the receipt of information from the UnitedStates of America under recent agreements, which has made necessary a numberof changes in the pattern of investment. As some of these have yet to be worked out it has not yet been possible to reach finality, but meanwhile a provisional estimate of investment of  52 millions for 1960-61 would be appropriate.Post Office15. The Postmaster-General has warned me that he may have to ask forsome rise on account of possible price increases. I have referred to the general question in paragraph 12.
Roads16. The latest proposals for roads in England and Wales would have involvedexpenditure of  70 millions in 1960-61; but the Minister of Transport has agreedto rearrange these so as to reduce the figure to  65 millions.Education17. The figures included for education are those agreed with the ministers concerned, and are of course in accordance with the White Paper. The figuresfor minor works for 1960-61 are included at the &quot;minimum&quot; figure, subject toreconsideration nearer the time as in paragraph 7.Electricity Council18. The present position is that a total of  296-2 millions has been agreed,a reduction of  12-5 millions on the original proposals for generation, transmission,&amp;c, having been offset by a rise of   11 - 5 millions in outlay on primary nuclearfuel charges, leaving  296 - 2 millions as the net result. Having regard to the markedexcesses in the programme in recent years, the speed with which it has expanded,and the additions recently allowed for reflationary purposes, I believe that thetotal is still somewhat higher than can be justified; I am anxious, therefore, thatthe discussions now proceeding with the Electricity Council should yield further savings.South of Scotland Electricity board north of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board19. The figures shown for 1960-61 have been agreed by the Scottish home department, but have yet to be finally settled with the Boards.British Transport Commission20. The programme for 1960-61 has been agreed by the Minister ofTransport. The increase of  7-5 millions for 1959-60 as compared with the figuregiven in E.D. (58) 15 is due to a later computation of the way in which the increasesagreed after last May&apos;s wages settlement will work out.National Coal Board21. The Minister of Power has agreed to my request for a reduction of 10 millions on the claims made by the National Coal Board for 1960-61 and isproposing it to the Board, expressing the view that they should accept it.Gas Council22. The Minister of Power has also agreed to propose a reduction of  1-millions to the Gas Council, leaving the figure for 1960-61 at  53 millions.Miscellaneous23. This heading covers diverse Government and local authority investment programmes. The figures for 1960-61 are an indication of the magnitude involved;the programmes for that year have yet to be discussed with Departments.Housing24. As explained in paragraph 10, these figures for 1960-61 ( 198 millions for England and Wales and  41-6 millions for Scotland) are on a &quot; minimum&quot;basis, subject to reconsideration next summer in relation to the size of the total public sector investment for 1960-61 that then appears desirable.25. For England and Wales, this &quot; minimum &quot; figure implies that the rateof approvals would be lowered to an annual rate of 92,500 in the second halfof next financial year, with this rate maintained through the first half of 1960-6.1.The &quot; normal&quot; programme is 100,000 a year: the minimum of 92,500 subtractsfrom the 100,000 the additional 7,500 houses ( 15 millions) authorised, for thepurposes of reflation, earlier this year. The time of construction of local authorityhouses in England and Wales is about nine months, so that a decision affecting theamount of investment in 1960-61 can be deferred for a long time yet.26. For Scotland, the &quot; minimum &quot; implies a reduction to 20,000 publicly-owned completions in 1960-61, of which 16,000 would be local authority houses.We agreed to aim at this figure in 1959-60 as consistent with an annual programmeof 100,000 in England and Wales.
27. But this programme is being much exceeded. The Scottish localauthorities en visage, programmes totalling 26,000 a year 10,000 (or  20 millions)more than is &quot;envisaged above. Moreover, the period between approval andcompletion is much longer in Scotland (about 18 months), so that decisions arealready being taken which will involve investment in 1960-61.28. The Secretary of State is reluctant to exercise any control over theScottish local authorities. But the dimensions are becoming so great threateningto rise to over  60 millions a year that I must press for control, and control thatwill keep the total within the  42 millions limit.Conclusion29.  To sum up, I would seek my colleagues&apos; endorsement for:  (a) The programme for 1959-60 in the annexed table, totalling  1,585 millions.(b) The working limits for 1960-61 in the table annexed, totalling.  1,595-1,600 millions, subject to final decisions next summer.(c) In particular, reservation of decisions on housing and other relatively fast-moving programmes, until we can see whether reflationary action willbe needed for 1960-61. (But imposition of control on Scottish housingwill be necessary in any case.)D. H.
