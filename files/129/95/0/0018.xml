H SECRETI THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1958 ^L\\\\\I C. (58) 218 &apos;&apos;&apos; .    Copy No. 3\21 st October, 1958 ^L\\\AH CABINETH IRISH REPUBLIC: IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY TERRORISMMemorandum by the Lord ChancellorDuring the recent summer months the Irish Republican Army (I.R.A.), ori splinter groups associated with them, have continued their terrorist activities againstI individuals, public utilities and military installations in Northern Ireland. Despitethe assurances of Mr. de Valera, the Taoiseach, to his own Parliament in July thatI he would mobilise all the resources of the Republic and, if necessary, take further j^^HI powers to quash these activities, murderous assaults upon the North have continued.| Between 5th and 7th September alone four incidents occurred in the North, andI a sizeable ammunition dump and dug-out were discovered by the Royal UlsterI Constabulary.2. The Home Secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary, as well as, of ^^^(I course, the Northern Ireland Government, are much concerned at these continuingI acts of aggression and at the apparent inability of the Irish Republican GovernmentI to deal more effectively with them.  This concern is heightened by the fact thatwMM        I the longer winter nights may still give greater scope to the terrorists.3. Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador was, therefore, recently asked to express toi Mr. de Valera in person the concern of Her Majesty&apos;s Government and to urgeI him to do everything in his power to suppress terrorists operating against the NorthI from south of the Border. I now circulate for the information of my colleaguesI Sir Alexander Clutterbuck&apos;s report of the conversation which he had with theI Taoiseach on 27th September. It is not intended to make any public referenceI to this exchange of views at the present time.  Bfrt should further serious incidents^LM        I occur, we must obviously reserve to ourselves the iipa&apos;to make Jb&amp;Wn at a suitableI time that we had warned the Irish Republ^fa government of the dangers which^Lm        I layI m\\\\\Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department, S.W.I, ^k-wmH 20th October, 1958.H , SECRET? 54216 ^L%m
SECRET imum 1 L^l^fl             REPORT FROM HER MAJESTY&apos;S AMBASSADOR IN DUBLIN ON A ^LM^fl      H &quot;            RECENT CONVERSATION WITH MR. DE VALE RA II saw Mr. de Valera on Saturday morning and had hard-hitting talk with him ^LwMlasting over an hour.  Result I regret to say was far from encouraging. m ^LwM2. He listened quietly while I developed our apprehensions to him, stressing fl UWkmrisks arising from recent recrudescence of I.R.A. activities and impact on Northernopinion and urging him to consider strengthening of counter-measures in Republic BUwM             before winter sets in.   But at first opportunity he launched out into fierce ^^Bdenunciation of evils of partition on only too familiar lines, rehearsing events (and ^^BUwM             of course all our mistakes) from 1912 onwards and arguing that so long as partition ^^Bexisted we could never hope for peace and quiet on the Border. The Government ^^Bhe said were doing their best to control things but there were limits to the actionthey could take without outraging public opinion and in any case they could only ^^Bdeal with the symptoms; it was only we and the North who could deal with the roots&apos; I ^^Bof the trouble and yet we refused to face up to the self-evident fact that so long as ^^Bwe declined to discuss the partition problem, so long would outbreaks of violence 1in one form or another continue.  There was no greater driving force affecting ^^Bhuman behaviour than the desire for the unity of one&apos;s country. This applied all 1 ^^BUwM             over the world and he would wager that none of the experiments in partition made ^^Banywhere would last or bring contentment.  The unity of Ireland was bound to ^^Bcome. Of course there were difficulties and he would not pretend that intervention ^^Bwould be easy for us but surely true statesmanship demanded that we should ^^Bexplore ways and means of helping unity forward instead of turning a blind eye to fl ^^flmWm             the problem as if it just did not exist. ^^fl3. I pointed out that it was unrealistic to talk in these terms. He knew our ^LwMattitude which was that the problem was one to be settled between Irishmen. No fl ^^flBritish Government could ever lend themselves to any action which would lead to ^LwMforcing part of the United Kingdom to separate from us against its will. I ^^flStatesmanship should surely demand efforts towards reconciliation with the North. ^LwMThis meant in turn cessation of violence which only increased bitterness and made I ^^flUwM closer relations impossible.^LwM 4.   Mr. de Valera replied that this argument was one he could not accept. Wecould not shuffle off responsibility in this way.  Division of Ireland was our own fl ^^flUwM             creation and sooner or later would have to be undone by us. Talk about forcing^-M             people out of the United Kingdom carried no conviction when we ourselves had h ^^flUwM             had no compunction in forcing whole areas (Fermanagh, Tyrone, Derry, &amp;c.) into ^LwMremaining in the United Kingdom against their will. I ^^B5,  I said that nevertheless, whatever his view, fact was that it was declared ^LwMpolicy of his Government that there should be no coercion of the North and that H^^flsolution should not be sought by violence. This policy had the support of the other ^LwMpolitical parties apart from Sinn Fein and I was sure it had the support too of 90 per ^^fl^mwm              cent, of the country.  Did not this provide the basis for firmer action to suppress^mwM             the present movement? It was not at all easy for instance to understand a position r ^^B^mjM              in which in defiance of the Government&apos;s known attitude the I.R.A. continued to [ !^^B^LwM             run its own newspaper, issue its own communiques and pursue its own perverse b!l^h^LwM             campaign in spite of all threats and warnings, thus in effect bringing the Government ^^B^LwM             into contempt.     %/r&quot; \mm\^LwM                   6.  To this I received however only an evasive reply.  Mr. de Valera said I Bfi^BUWkm             might be right in saying that 90 per cent, of the country was against violence, but j flt^^flfact was, that of that 90 per cent, nearly all approved the objectives of those J H^^flUWkW             implicated. It was the methods that they disapproved; none the less there was a fl ^^B^LwM             strong underlying sympathy everywhere for the men taking part.   It was this ^^B^LwM            &quot;sympathy which had to be taken very carefully into account by the Government ^^B^LwM             in considering how far they could go with their repressive measures, and now their I ^^B^LwM             freedom might be further curtailed by the action of the Human Rights Commission flSECRETE ^kW
H SECRETI in ruling the Lawless case to be admissible. (Gerrard Lawless, who was interned inI the Curragh under the Offences against the State Act, but was subsequently releasedI on signing an undertaking not to indulge in illegal activities, has now appealed toI the Human Rights Commission against his allegedly unlawful detention. TheI Commission has ruled the3 appeal to be admissible. The merits of the case-which^H may significantly affect the other 100 odd detainees-have, however, yet to beI considered by a subsidiary organ of the Commission.)H 7.  Continuing, Mr. de Valera said that he had been very glad to have thisI talk with me as he had been wanting to tell me that he was a good deal worriedI about the implications of the Lawless case. He had felt for some time that he couldI not keep the men in the Curragh in internment indefinitely, and he had alreadysummoned the Minister of Justice and asked him to consider each case afresh withI a view to some move towards releasing selected individuals least likely to do harm. ^^^HI I said that this surely might have a very serious effect in encouraging renewed ^^^HI violence and putting new heart into the I.R.A., just too when a further tighteningI of the screw was wanted.   Would not the difficulty with the Human RightsI Commission be overcome, if a state of emergency was declared?  He replied that ^^^HI there was no state of emergency; and I said that there clearly was, and I wanted to ^^^HI press this on him.   He then said that he could never carry public opinion in L^^HI believing so, and continued somewhat dejectedly in this strain when I told him that ^^^HI in my view he could do it to-morrow, if he chose; the public would accept any lead f^^HI from ^^^H8. I then reminded him of his speech in the Dail in July when he said that he ^^^HI would mobilise all the resources of the country and take further powers if necessary. ^^^HI He replied that he was &quot; angry at the time &quot; and wished to knock the heads of the ^^^HI various parties together. Clear implication was that on calmer reflection he does ^^^HI not feel able to go ahead on this line, rather the reverse. _^^H9. In course of interview I stressed risks of sectarian trouble in the North ^^^HI and of general deterioration in relations and before leaving tried to persuade him ^^^HI again to some fresh positive action, e.g., suppression of the United Irishman and ^^^HI a new directive to the Police. He was however non-committal in reply. As regards |^^^|I the former, he said that the paper had been closely watched, but he was advised ^^^HI that it was very cleverly just keeping on the right side of the law. A further point ^^^HIwas that it was very expensive to run; it was therefore draining off I.R.A. funds ^^^HHwhich might otherwise be used in more dangerous directions. ^^^H10. Interview closed with his saying once more that he was doing his best ^^^HBand was only too anxious for better relations but these could never come about H^^HBwhile root cause of present difficulties remained untackled. I on my side repeated ^^^HHthat whatever the wider problems we looked to him to take whatever counter- ^^^HHmeasures might be needed to keep down further violence. ^^^H11. Interview taken as a whole was discouraging since unless Mr. de Valera ^^^HHwas keeping up a front for my benefit implication seemed to be that so far from ^^^HHour being able to count on more vigorous action here he may feel himself obliged ^^^HHto soft-pedal in some directions.   He seemed genuinely quite shaken on the^H HLawless case; on the other hand his estimate of the political difficulty in declaring ^^^H^H Ha state of emergency for the purposes of the Human Rights Convention seemed ^^^HHto me greatly exaggerated. His main objective remains as always to force someHmove towards the discussion of partition and though I hardly think he can hopeHto frighten us in this direction I do not doubt that his attitude to my approachHwas coloured to some extent by this underlying aim. In any case I feel thatBnterview which was friendly enough may have done some good in bringing homeHto him our concern. He was as alert and vigorous as usual but whole subject isHso emotional for him that it is difficult for him to discuss it calmly. *^^^H12. In the course of talk I handed him a list of reported training camps in^H Hthis country. (This list contained the names of eight camps thought by the Northern ^^^^H^H) Hlreland authorities to have been operated by the I.R.A. during the summer months.)^Ht HHe said that holding of any such camps was &quot; entire news &quot; to him and he would f^^^H^He Hcertainly look into the matter. f^^^HH SECRET
