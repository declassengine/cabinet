secret this document is the property of her britannic majestvs governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1958C. (58) 212 Copy No.21st October, 1958CABINETSTEEL : LOCATION OF NEW WORKSMemorandum by the Minister of power in April and May the Cabinet discussed memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister for Welsh Affairs (C. (58) 66 and 87) about the site of the proposed new strip mill. On 21st May the Cabinet invited me to consider with the Iron and Steel Board what alternative site would be least objectionable, interms of cost of operation, management and other relevant factors, if an IndustrialDevelopment Certificate were to be refused for Newport (C.C. (58) 44th Conclusions,Minute 6).2. The Annex to this paper contains a summary of the possibilities whichhave been examined by the Iron and Steel Board, and of the Board&apos;s advice, withwhich I agree.3. The basis of the proposals which follow is that enough sheet capacity shouldbe installed in Scotland to meet Scotland&apos;s needs, present and prospective, and thatthe first stage of a major strip mill development should be installed at the most economic site, with full scope for expansion.4. Scotland. I recommend that capacity to produce a quarter of a million tons of sheet should be installed at Ravenscraig, near Glasgow, by Colvilles Limited,subject to negotiation with the Company on the provisions of finance. The totalcost of the scheme, which will also increase Colvilles&apos; output of other products,is likely to be about  45 millions. In the present circumstances all or nearly all of this money may have to be found from the Exchequer, and the terms may haveto be easier than would be usual in a normal commercial transaction.5. In no case do I recommend the building of a steelworks at Grangemouthbecause of the serious economic disadvantages of the site.6. Wales. The Ravenscraig project by itself goes only part of the way tomeet the expected requirement. I further recommend that capacity to producehalf a million tons of sheet, tinplate and light plate should be built at Newport byRichard Thomas and Baldwins, Limited (R.T.B.). The cost of the scheme willbe about  90 millions which must all be found from public funds, as R.T.B. arepublicly owned. The scheme can be regarded as the first stage of a major development capable of expansion up to 3 million tons or more of crude steel.The site is the best economic site that can be found for a project of this nature.7. In no case do I recommend Kidwelly as a site. It has serious economicdisadvantages, and its use would largely prevent access to 900 million tons of coal.8. England. I do not recommend the building of the strip mill atImmingham. The site is less economic than Newport and has no sociologicaladvantages.9. If the Cabinet are prepared to approve that negotiations should proceed on the above lines it is a matter for consideration when Parliament should beinformed and in what terms.54210
10. It has been suggested that the Government should announce their intention to proceed during the Debate on the Address. There are difficulties inthis suggestion owing to the fact that financial arrangements have not yet beenagreed with Colvilles. Should an announcement be made and subsequently wefail to come to terms with Colvilles, it might prove a bull point for the opposition in their campaign to renationalise steel.11. The Iron and Steel Board have arranged for conversations to take placethis week with Colvilles and perhaps with the Treasury. I would propose to reportorally to the Cabinet when we meet as to the position and as to the possibilitiesof a statement.M.Ministry of Power, S.W. 1,20th October, 1958.annex the project discussed by the Cabinet in April and May was an integrated steelworks with an initial capacity of 1 million tons of crude steel or 730,000 tons of finished steel. The initial cost was estimated to be  120 millions, and the scheme would be capable of expansion up to 3 million ingot tons or beyond.2. The Iron and Steel Board are engaged with the help of GovernmentDepartments and the industry in reviewing the probable level of demand for steel in the mid-1960s. In advance of the main review, the Board have re-examined theoutlook for sheet, tinplate and light plate. They consider that for planning purposes a minimum deficiency of % million tons in the mid-1960s must be assumed.The full review which the Board are undertaking is not expected to establish a lower deficiency. The capacity constructed to meet the minimum deficiency mustbe capable of fairly rapid expansion.3. I have reviewed the four sites originally considered for the new steel works with the Iron and Steel Board and the National Coal Board. On economic groundsNewport remains unquestionably the best site. Immingham is on economic groundsthe next best site, but the cost of finished steel would be  1 a ton higher atImmingham than at Newport. To choose Immingham would be ill-received inScotland and Wales nor are there any sociological grounds for the choice.Operating costs at Grangemouth would be over  3 a ton more than at Newport:the differential would increase as the plant expanded. In face of this, no steelcompany is prepared to construct capacity at Grangemouth. The cost at Kidwellywould be some  2 10s. a ton higher than at Newport, and the choice of this sitewould largely prevent access to 900 million tons of coal which the National coal board intend to work.4. But since May new possibilities have emerged, and in my view a solution tothe problem of siting can now be found. The first of these new possibilities is theprovision by Colvilles at Ravenscraig (15 miles south-east of Glasgow, and 21 miles west of Grangemouth) of capacity for producing 250,000 tons of cold reducedsheet. The new capacity would be integrated with existing capacity atRavenscraig and Colvilles&apos; other works near Glasgow. The capital outlaywould be around  45 millions, and would increase Colvilles&apos; capacity by340,000 tons of other products (rod, bar, medium plate) as well as by 250,000 tonsof sheet. Scottish sheet consumption is at present 150,000 tons a year. Scottishsheet production in 1957 was 58,000 tons, all from handmills, and the greater part from Colvilles. Handmill sheet is dearer and of worse quality than cold reducedsheet from the continuous strip mills: the Scottish handmills are to be regarded asobsolescent. The installation of cold reduced capacity at Ravenscraig would replace the obsolescent handmill production; meet all current Scottish demands for cold reduced sheet; provide reserve capacity; and allow of expansion to meet any growth of Scottish sheet consumption.
5. In the current situation Colvilles are unlikely to be able to finance such an expansion by normal methods. It might be necessary for the greater part of the 45 millions to be provided from the Exchequer. The terms of a Government loanmight have to be easier than normal commercial terms.6. The second possibility would be to reduce the scale of the Newportproject so as to make room for Colvilles&apos; production. This could be done without loss of efficiency and without prejudice to later expansion. A modified scheme at newport to produce \ million tons would cost about  90 millions. some contribution would no doubt be available from profits, but in the main the cost would fall on the Exchequer. The site would be capable of ultimate expansion upto 3 million ingot tons or over. Expansion by R.T.B. at Newport would be linked with their existing works at Ebbw Vale.7. The third possibility is the provision by the Steel Company of Wales(S.C.O.W.) at a site six miles east of Swansea of capacity to produce \ million tonsof sheet, tinplate and light plate. Such a plant would work in conjunction withthe company&apos;s tinplate and sheet rolling capacity at Trostre and Velindre to thewest and at Margam to the east of Swansea. The site could ultimately be developedup to a maximum of about 2 million ingot tons, but not beyond. This, like the reduced Newport scheme, would cost around  90 millions. In the presentcircumstances a substantial part of this might have to be provided by way ofa loan from the Exchequer, but a third or more might be available from profits.8. Having regard to the trend of discussions in the Cabinet earlier this year,I asked the Iron and Steel Board in giving me their further advice on the siting of additional strip mill capacity to assume, first, that it would not be an acceptablesolution to the Government to place the development at Newport, and secondly,that some sheet capacity must be provided in Scotland. I have had extensivediscussions with the Chairman of the Board, and now have their advice.9. Given that some sheet capacity must be installed in Scotland, the Boardadvise that Colvilles&apos; Ravenscraig project should go forward. In no case should plant be sited at Grangemouth because of the serious economic disadvantages ofthe site. Though the Colvilles&apos; project is likely in the foreseeable future to resultin some underloading of their strip mill capacity, the Board recognise thateconomically the scheme makes sense for Colvilles, since it would be geared in totheir existing works, and would improve their output of other products (includingplate) in quantity and in quality. At a cost of  45 millions the scheme would produce 250,000 tons of sheet and 340,000 tons of other products, and in full production should give a return on capital of 12 per cent, (before depreciation).The terms of a Government loan to Colvilles would be for negotiation.10. A decision to go ahead with the Colvilles project will still leave a need forthe immediate development of new strip capacity elsewhere. It is clear that the choice of site for such further development rests between Swansea and Newport.The Board consider, and I agree with them, that Newport should be selected. they also consider, and again I agree with them that it would be better for an expansion in South Wales to be undertaken by R.T.B. rather than by S.C.O.W.11.   My reasons for preferring Newport over Swansea are:  (a) the Swansea site is less capable of expansion than Newport;(b) the Swansea site involves higher costs for raw materials and higher deliverycharges for finished products than Newport. These disadvantageswould be mitigated at the \ million ton stage by making use of existingspare tinplate and sheet rolling capacity at S.C.O.W.&apos;s other works, but would become progressively more important as the scale of operationsgrew;(c) thus, although an additional works set down six miles south-east of Swanseawould be nearer to the depressed communities of South-West Walesthan would one at Newport, a decision to expand there would run a grave risk of repeating the mistake made in putting the present R.T.B.works in Ebbw Vale. A major expansion should be placed in the besteconomic site available. For the reasons set out in paragraph 12 below Iprefer R.T.B. as the company to carry out this development and, to my mind, the choice of R.T.B. heavily reinforces the economic arguments for Newport;
id) I fully appreciate the difficulties presented by this proposal to the Presidentof the Board of Trade. Nevertheless I do urge the view that a majorsteel works is really in a special category. The technical and economicrequirements do limit the choice of a site and their satisfaction shouldbe the over-riding consideration.12.   My reasons for preferring R.T.B. over S.C.O.W. are:  id) the Governments holding in S.C.O.W. is already very large. Thecompany&apos;s ordinary capital is  40 millions. The Iron and Steel holding and Realisation Agency (I.S.H.R.A.) hold  65 millions debenture stock,and have in addition agreed to make loans of a further  40 millionsavailable to the company up to 1964. If S.C.O.W. undertook thescheme, the Governments holding might increase even further, andwould certainly remain high for a much longer period. Such a financial structure in a de-vested company would attract adverse comment.This would be all the more likely as the Government would be alsoproviding the capital for another de-vested Company Colvilles forthe Scottish project;ib) R.T.B., on the other hand, are wholly owned by I.S.H.R.A., the presentbook value being  24-2 millions. The company expect in the nextyears to call on a balance of  2 millions they have on deposit withI.S.H.R.A., and on  6 millions which I.S.H.R.A. have agreed to make available as a loan for schemes already approved. The Government isthe normal source of finance for a State-owned undertaking.(c) there are three strip mill operators in the country, S.C.O.W., R.T.B. andSummers in North Wales. The size of their operations is comparedbelow:  S.C.O.W.: 3 million ingot tons.Summers: 2 million ingot tons.R.T.B.: 1 million ingot tons (plus about   million tons in other activities).If the Government were to lend money to S.C.O.W. to finance a further expansion in preference to R.T.B., it would further increase the disparity between the companies;id) it is agreed that R.T.B. cannot be de-vested before the next GeneralElection. Should the company remain in its present state there willbe little chance of de-vesting after the Election. If, on the other hand,money is put into this publicly-owned company so as to improve its efficiency, it will be a more valuable asset whether offered for de-vestingor retained by the Government.
