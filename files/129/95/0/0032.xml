THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTHE FEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND NY AS ALANDNote by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations have agreed, with the concurrence of the Colonial Secretary, that we shallbe ready to see a Federal Minister of Rhodesia and Nyasaland on 19th November,to discuss the representations made by the Government of the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland about the proposed changes in the Northern RhodesiaConstitution. Subject to the result of the Federal general election on 12th November,Sir Roy Welensky is likely to come himself.2. I hope that we can treat this as a self-contained exercise and that it willnot cause us too much trouble, but as the Northern Rhodesia Constitution is closely linked in Sir Roy Welensky&apos;s mind with the future of the Federation I attach, asbackground, a memorandum setting out some personal reflections on the problems that fie ahead in this part of Central Africa. I would stress that this memorandum is circulated at this stage solely as an explanation of the background against whichI view the Colonial Secretary&apos;s Northern Rhodesian proposals with which in themselves I agree. In so far as my memorandum raises new issues of policy, Ipropose to ask for these to be considered in the Colonial Policy Committee afterthe visit of Sir Roy Welensky or his successor.Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1958C. (58) 23212th November, 1958Copy No.   58CABINETH.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1.12th November, 1958.54305
PROBLEMS THAT LIE AHEAD IN THE AREA OF THE FEDERATIONOF RHODESIA AND NYASALANDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the Federation was established in 1953, from the three Territories of SouthernRhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Southern Rhodesia had beeninternally self-governing since 1923. It now has a population of 178,000 europeans and 2-3 million Africans. Northern Rhodesia with 71,000 Europeans and 2 millionAfricans, and Nyasaland with 8,000 Europeans and 2-6 million Africans, were, andare, protectorates, administered by Colonial Service officers under the responsibilityof the Secretary of State for the Colonies, though some services have beenFederalised. The Federation was thus a hybrid from the start. But this was thebest solution that could be devised at the time. The previous attempt at mereco-ordination through a body known as the Central African Council had provedinadequate, but opinion both in the Northern Territories and in this country wouldnot stand for amalgamation.2. The Constitution provided that it was to be reviewed not less than seven,nor more than nine, years from the date when it came into force. The conference is to be between delegations from the Federation, the three Territories and theUnited Kingdom, chosen by their respective Governments. After discussions withthe Federal Prime Minister in London in April 1957, we agreed in a public declaration that the constitutional review conference should be convened at theearliest permissible date, viz., in 1960 (it cannot be earlier than October 1960),and that&quot; the purpose of this conference is to review the Constitution in the light ofthe experience gained since the inception of Federation and in addition toagree on the constitutional advances which may be made. In this lattercontext the conference will consider a programme for the attainment of sucha status as would enable the Federation to become eligible for full membership of the Commonwealth.&quot;3. The preamble of the Federal Constitution provides that Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland shall enjoy separate governments for &quot; so long as their respertivepeople so desire,&quot; those governments remaining responsible, subject to the iltimate authority of the United Kingdom Government for, in particular, the control ofland in those Territories and for the local and territorial political advancement oftheir peoples. By pledges given in the course of the Federation debates in 1953,we are committed to preserve the protectorate status of the Northern Territories for as long as the inhabitants, including the Africans, so desire, and not to introduceamalgamation.4. The ambitions of the Federal Government have two aspects: the removalof United Kingdom controls from the Federal Government, referred to later in this paper as &quot; internal autonomy &quot; (they say they can never win the African&apos;s loyalty to Federation if he can always look over his shoulder to the United KingdomGovernment), and full independent status for the Federation in external relations,referred to below as &quot; sovereign status.&quot; Internal autonomy is within the powerof the United Kingdom Government to grant or to withhold. Sovereign statusdepends on recognition by other Commonwealth governments and foreign government. It would be possible to grant a larger measure of internal autonomy,or even complete autonomy in Federal affairs, without creating a constitutional position which would entitle the Federation to claim sovereign status. TheFederation could probably not enjoy internationally recognised sovereign statuswithout complete internal autonomy, both in Federal and regional affairs. it follows that the Federation is not likely to be regarded as eligible for full membership of the Commonwealth until United Kingdom controls have been
withdrawn from Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The dilemma is this. If wewithdraw from the Northern Territories before we have built up Governments andLegislatures there that the Africans support, we shall be accused of disregardingour pledges. If we hang on in the Northern Territories, the Federation will notattain sovereign status and full membership of the Commonwealth.5. If, therefore, the Federal Government and the Europeans in the Federationare to obtain sovereign status for the Federation, they must, on the one hand,reconcile themselves to accepting an evolution in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasalandwhich will provide for greater African participation in the processes of governmentand, on the other hand, they must make Federal policies acceptable to Africansthroughout the Federation and, indeed, to the large body of opinion in this country which supports the African attitude. At the same time a double task will fallon us. We shall have to ensure that the Administrations in Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland make the most vigorous attempts to convince Africans there ofthe advantages of federation, and we shall probably this is my provisional viewsubject to discussion in the Colonial Policy Committee have to stretch theinterpretation of the 1953 pledges, so as to be able to hand over in the northern territories within a reasonable time.6. It is just possible that the Federal Government would prefer to carry on for some years longer under the shield of the United Kingdom. But neither theynor we can be blind to the pace of political advance elsewhere in Africa. In thepast few years they have seen Libya, Tunisia, Morocco and Ghana attainindependence. Guinea has just voted itself independence. Somalia and nigeria are to become independent in 1960. It is galling to the Europeansin Rhodesia to be told that their country is less ripe for independencethan these other (purely African) countries. Meanwhile the more african states that attain independence, the more the Africans in Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland will be encouraged to hope for independent status for those territories outside the Federation unless their aspirations can be satisfied inside the Federation.7. Action on our part to increase African participation in Government inNorthern Rhodesia and Nyasaland should therefore strengthen the Federation, andis necessary if the advance of the Federation to independence within theCommonwealth (in the sense of &quot; Sovereign Status &quot;) is to take place within apolitically tolerable period. .8. Nevertheless, given the present stage of development of the Africans inthese Territories, it is inevitable that, if the Federation is to be maintained andbuilt up, this can only be under European leadership. I recognise that africans in Nyasaland, and to some extent in Northern Rhodesia, are opposed to theFederation. But this is nothing new. It was in full awareness of the criticism v/we should encounter, both in this country and in Central Africa, that we decided from1951-53 to go ahead with Federation. We took the view that it fell to us to givea lead, and that we should not be deterred by extremist opposition. The basic factshave not changed since then.9. I have felt for some time that we are in danger of losing the sense of purposewhich led us to establish the Federation in 1953, and of faltering in an apparentconflict between, on the one hand, the views expressed by Africans in the northern territories and their sympathisers in this country, and, on the other, themaintenance of the Federation under European leadership. These two conceptsshould balance, not conflict. We should not allow factious opposition fromAfricans in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland to deflect us from a policy ofbuilding up a strong Federation. We should make it clear to the federal government that our policy of maintaining the Federation is unchanged and thatwe want to back them up. If convinced of our desire to support them, they will,I hope, be readier to accept that this is only politically practicable if we providefuller scope for African aspirations in the processes of government in the northern territories. Conversely, the sensible Africans in the Northern Territories may come to a livelier appreciation of the benefits of Federation when they are convinced of the prospects of political advancement for the Northern Territories within theFederation.
10. Sir Roy Welensky, when he is here, will certainly wish to have some discussion on the future of the Federation and the prospects of the 1960Constitutional review. As the Review cannot begin until October of that year no decisions are required on this now, but before long I will suggest that the colonial secretary and I bring the problem to the Colonial Policy Committee and theCabinet as there is much to be foreseen.H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,12th November, 1958.
