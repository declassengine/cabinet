fH^S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(58) 21921st October, 1958ARMED FORCES: FAMILY pensions memorandum by the Minister of defence the Advisory Committee on Recruiting, under the chairmanship of Sir James Grigg, have recommended &quot;that future family pensions should be increased to give widows one-third of the pension which the husband was drawing or (in the case of those still serving) the pensionhe would have drawn had he been invalided&quot;.   They have stated explicitlythat the scheme should continue on the present non-contributory basis.The Service Ministers and I are anxious to put this recommendation intoeffect as it stands.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer, while preparedto accept the scale of benefits proposed by the Grigg Committee, is anxious that any new scheme should be on a contributory basis.2.        I am aware of the Governments general policy that pensions should normally be contributory and of the statement in the 1956 white paper on Service Pay and Pensions that &quot;any future revision of familypensions would be on a contributory basis&quot;.3.        On the other hand, the difficulties of a contributory scheme wouldbe very serious.   Servicemen are unique among State employees, inthat most of the men in the ranks do not serve long enough to earnpensions.   To deduct contributions from pay would mean collecting smalland varying sums every week from every man, recording them and, forall but a minority, returning them, after calculating interest, when theman leaves the Service.   This would be an immense waste of labour.   Theonly alternative would be to deduct the contributions from the grant whichlong-service officers and men receive on retirement.   This grant is,however, as the Grigg Committee point out, designed to help them in the transition to civil life at an age when resettlement is difficult.4.        Whatever method was employed to introduce a contributoryscheme would be resented in the Services.   At the least it could berepresented with some justification that the existing family pensions havefallen in value through inflation and were not increased pari passu with pay;and that to insist on a contribution as a condition of increasing them isto worsen the terms of service.   To create a grievance in this way mightwell damage recruiting.5.        I do not believe it should be impossible, if the Committee&apos;recommendation is accepted, to hold our position with other employeesby pointing out that Servicemen&apos;s pensions have never been contributory;and that this and other features of their conditions of service are designedto make up for some of the inevitable drawbacks of a Service career.-1-COPY NO--aCABINET
6.        In short, I consider that the gain from introducing a contributoryscheme would not be worth the disadvantages of rejecting an explicitrecommendation by a strong independent Committee; and of damagingrecruiting at a critical juncture.D.S.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1.2lst October, 1958-2-
