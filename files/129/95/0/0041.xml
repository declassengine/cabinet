confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. November 1958C. (58) 241 Copy No.21st November, 1958CABINETHORTICULTURE AND THE HORTICULTURAL TARIFFMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food must ask my colleagues to consider the wider implications of recent decisions by the Economic Policy Committee about horticultural tariffs.2. The horticultural tariffs were last changed in 1953. Last year the national farmers&apos; Union (N.F.U.) put forward applications for increases in the tariff onfive important horticultural crops, and these were considered in the usual way bythe Tariffs Advisory Committee. I took the view that there was a case for increase on certain crops, particularly those important to the glasshouse industry. i therefore proposed to the Economic Policy Committee increases in the tariff ontomatoes and cut flowers. In both cases my colleagues took the view that theeconomic case was not sufficiently strong for any increase.3. In my view an announcement now that all the applications by the N.F.U.for an increase in tariffs have been rejected will lay the Government open to severe criticism. Under the Agriculture Act, 1947, we have promised for agriculturestability and adequate levels of remuneration: under that Act agriculture includeshorticulture. From 1947 onwards it has repeatedly been stated that since guaranteed prices are excessively difficult to operate for horticultural products the tariff wouldbe the main instrument used to implement our undertaking to horticulture.4. During the past few years the position of horticulture has worsened. Costshave risen sharply particularly labour, and fuel for the glasshouse industry.Indeed the rise in costs in the glasshouse industry at any rate appears to have beennoticeably steeper here than in our main competitor Holland. Prices, on the otherhand, have not kept pace. Even allowing for steady improvement in efficiency the horticultural producer is falling behind. Further investments in equipment and storage and in improvements in standards of grading are required. (For examplean additional  2 millions ought to be invested in apple storage over the next fiveyears.) At present the industry certainly does not possess either the confidence orthe means to carry out such investment.5. There are 50,000 growers in the horticultural industry. At almost every point our policies seem to discriminate against them. They benefit little from the farm Improvement Scheme, or from my new Small Farmers Scheme. Potash,which horticulture uses by itself far more than agriculture, is the only fertiliser notsubsidised. Apple and pear producers are worried that recent statements at montreal and New Delhi mean that we shall not be able to continue quotas much longer. We have rejected a number of proposals put up by the N.F.U. for special assistance to horticulture. If we now announce that all the tariff applications which are regarded as abundantly justified by the industry are rejected, I think we shall be in a very difficult position, and indeed in breach of our 1947 Actobligations.6. I ask my colleagues, therefore, to consider whether we ought, in order to honour our obligations under the 1947 Act, to increase the duties to help theglasshouse industry which is at present most seriously affected.54358CONFIDENTIAL
7. If my colleagues do not accept that, then I consider we must take othersteps to assist horticulture. I have been considering this. It may be that we couldwork out proposals for new production grants aimed at assisting the industry toincrease efficiency and profitability similar to some of those we have adopted for agriculture. These would at least be an alternative to a further increase in tariffsat this point though the existing level of tariffs would still be essential. Inevitablythey would involve further subsidies, which could not be taken into account atthe Annual Price Review.8. I have in mind also other possibilities designed to get the industry to helpitself and not involving Government money. Together these measures and our proposals on London horticultural markets might constitute a new Charter for horticulture.9.   I ask my colleagues, therefore, either (a) to agree to some increase in the duties on tomatoes and cut flowers tohelp the glasshouse industry, or(b) to authorise me to say publicly at the same time as we announce the rejection of the tariff applications that we are considering a schemedesigned to assist the industry to improve the competitive position ofhorticulture and shall soon be discussing it in confidence with theleaders of the industry.J. H.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S.W. I,21st November, 1958.
