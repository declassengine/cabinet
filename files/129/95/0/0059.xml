secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1958C. (58) 25919th December, 1958CABINETPENSIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and the Lord Privy SealOn 4th December, 1958, the Cabinet invited me to arrange for furtherconsideration to be given by the Ministerial Committee on Pensions to thepossibility of improving the arrangements for pensions increments (C.C. (58)83rd Conclusions, Minute 6).2. My colleagues will recall that in my Memorandum (C. (58) 244) I reportedthat the Ministerial Committee saw some merit in proposals to shorten the period for which a person who defers retirement has to work in order to earn an incrementon his basic pension and to improve the rates of increment so earned.3. The present position is that an insured.person on reaching the minimumretirement age has a choice of retiring from regular work and drawing his pensionor postponing retirement. In the latter case he would continue to pay his normalshare of the contribution while working and would draw no pension. For eachblock of twenty-five contributions paid for weeks in which he had worked duringdeferred retirement his eventual pension would be increased by Is. 6d., and, ifhe was married, that of his wife by Is.4. The proposal before us was to provide an increment of Is. for twelvecontributions (with 6d. on the wifes pension for each twelve contributions). Thecost of this concession up to the spring of 1961 would be about million andwould thereafter rise by about  1 million a year, reaching a total of  20 millions in 1979-80. There would be some saving on Vote provision for national assistance.5. We considered the main criticisms which have been made of the existing arrangements, namely, that the level of increments had been fixed in 1951when benefits were substantially lower than at present; that where retirementoccurred shortly before the end of a twenty-five week period all the contributions paid up to that point would be wasted; and that one of the main criticisms of theproposals outlined in the White Paper had been the lack of any immediate benefitsaccruing. We also considered the financial objections to improving the level ofincrements at this point in time.6. We were agreed that the present incremental period was too long. Wewere generally in favour of accepting the proposal for an increment of Is. for eachtwelve contributions, but the Financial Secretary, Treasury, while agreeing to a shorter incremental period, was unable to accept the proposal for a higher rate and felt bound to reserve the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ position. He proposedinstead increments either of 9d. for each twelve contributions or 6d. for each eightcontributions.7. Recognising that the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ position must be reserved I think it right that I should set out for my colleagues the main arguments that were advanced.Copy No.   5S54484
&apos;   8.  The arguments in favour of the proposal were (i) The increments, which were never designed to give full actuarial returnby way of compensation for pensions forgone and contributions paid,had been fixed when benefit rates were substantially lower and had therefore become even more out of scale.(ii) The approval of the Cabinet (C.C. (58) 83rd Conclusions, Minute 6) ofthe concession in respect of earnings limits for retired pensioners hadbeen a step in the direction of meeting the criticism about lack of immediate benefits, so far as people who had retired from regular workwere concerned. A complementary concession for those who decidedto defer retirement instead of retiring from regular work and drawingtheir pensions would hold the balance between these two categories.The concession could be logically defended and would be popular.(iii) A concession on these lines would be particularly helpful to those whowere not members of occupational schemes and who might thereby be encouraged to remain in full-time employment and so improve on their basic pension. Concern had been expressed in both Houses ofParliament about the position of this class of pensioner.(iv) A proposal to shorten the incremental period without improving the ratemight well prove impossible to maintain against the pressures whichwould develop in the course of the passage of the Bill. It would,therefore, be better to make any concession at the outset rather than tobe driven to do so, thus losing any credit for it.9.   The arguments advanced against the proposal were:  (i) The increased costs which would be incurred as a result of improving theincrement rate would increase the average annual deficits until the endof the quinquennium 1971-76 and would thus materially impair the concept of financial soundness on which basis the scheme was beingpresented. Any savings on the National Assistance Vote would not affect these deficits and would in any case be comparatively very small.(ii) Though the proposed improvement would help the diminishing numberof those were were not in occupational schemes, it would also beavailable to the increasing number who were, and whose need was much less.(iii) The main reasons for remaining at work after 65 were in order to earn afull-time wage and to remain active. Rates of increment would only have a marginal effect.(iv) Although the Government were at present debarred by electoral pledgesfrom raising the minimum age of retirement, consideration would doubtless have to be given to this in the next Parliament. Considerableimprovements in the rate of pension payable at retirement ages above65 would certainly then be necessary and the present proposal shouldbe reserved to play its part in those improvements.10. I invite my colleagues to decide, on the basis of the above arguments,the issue whether or not to provide an increment of Is. for 12 contributions (with6d. on the wife&apos;s pension) in place of the existing arrangements of Is. 6d. for25 contributions.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,18th December, 1958.
