PENAL PRACTICE IN A CHANGING SOCIETY-      ASPECTS OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENTv.- (ENGLAND AND WALES)I. introduction. It is a disquieting feature of our society that, in the years since thewar, rising standards in material prosperity, education and social welfarehave brought no decrease in the high rate of crime reached during the war:on the contrary, crime has increased and is still increasing. The purpose ofthis paper is first to give the facts about this situation, then to set out proposalsof the Government for dealing with some of its aspects. This Paper does not seek to deal with those deep-seated causes which, even were they fully understood, would be largely beyond the reach of Government action.The growth of crime2. The growth of crime is no new problem ; the increase during the war was much greater than the increase during the past 13 years. Between 1939and 1945 the number of indictable offences, and of persons convicted ofthem, increased by one-half. Since 1945 there have been both upward anddownward movements in crime, and as this is written, in 1958, an upward movement has been in progress for over three years. But it followed an equally long downward movement from a peak in 1951, and in total thereis not much difference between the figures for 1957 and those for 1951.Even compared with 1945, the figures for 1957 were higher by no morethan about one-seventh. The same is generally true of most non-indictableoffences, which include some such as malicious damage to property thatare only technically different from indictable offences. (See diagram 1 inAppendix A.)3. The fact that the war-time increase, so far from receding, has continued,although less steeply and with fluctuations, gives cause for grave concern.Moreover, the growth of crime since the war has two disturbing features.One is that indictable offences against the person that is, crimes of violence and sexual offences have increased steadily in number since the end ofthe war. Their total is still small compared with the number of offences ofdishonesty, but they have increased persistently every year.4. Another aspect which is perhaps even more disturbing, is that inthe last few years there has been a startling increase in convictions of youngmen aged, roughly, from 16 to 21. These men are responsible for morethan their, share of the increase in offences of violence ; but the increased rate of crime at these ages extends to offences of all kinds. Drunkenness isi31577 A 2
one important example. The number of convictions of this offence has inrecent years increased to well above the pre-war level, and, as with more serious crime, the increase at the young adult ages is disproportionately large.5. The increase in crime during the last two or three years has led tosevere overcrowding in prisons and has strained the resources of other agenciessuch as borstals, approved schools and the probation service. The approvedschool population in January, 1956, was 6,800; it is now approximat-&apos;-7,700. The population of prisons and borstals at the beginning of if,was 21,000 ; now it is over 26,000. The abnormal increase in delinquency atages between 16 and 21 has caused a particularly large increase in the borstalpopulation which rose from 2,800 at the beginning of 1956 to 4,500 in March,1958, an increase of 61 per cent. (See diagrams 2 and 3 in Appendix A.)These increases do not, in the main, reflect any change in the sentencingpractice of the courts. They are a direct result of the increase in the numberof convictions and of the speed with which the increase has taken place.The increase in crimes by women and girls has been very much less marked,and there has been no significant increase in the population of the women&apos;sprisons or girls&apos; borstals.The weapons against crimeThe police6. The State&apos;s weapons against crime are threefold an efficient police force, the deterrent effect of the criminal law, and the penal system, whoseobject must be to prevent as many offenders as possible from returning tocrime.7. The Government has a primary duty to maintain The Queen&apos;s peace and for that purpose to ensure that there are efficient and vigilant police forces to protect the public against attacks on their persons or property.Except in the Metropolis, where the Home Secretary is the police authority,the police forces are locally administered. But, in view of the Government^general responsibility for law and order, there must be a partnership. TheSecretary of State&apos;s share of this partnership takes various forms. In con-sultation with the Police Council, he settles, by regulations, the conditionsof service of members of police forces. His specific functions include theapproval of appointments of Chief Constables and of the authorised strengths of police forces. He determines appeals against serious disciplinary punish-ments. The payment of the Exchequer grant in aid of police expendituredepends on his being satisfied that the force in question is efficientlyadministered. It has always been the aim, in the exercise of these functions, toavoid unnecessary interference with the autonomy of police authorities ;but where the interests of an individual force, or of the service as a whole,require him to do so the Secretary of State does not hesitate to use thepowers with which Parliament has entrusted him.8. The first duty of the police is to prevent crime and the next to be efficient in detecting crime which has been committed. For the purpose ofprevention there must be a sufficient number of police officers and theymust be employed to the best advantage. Although there are serious shortages of police in a few areas, the total number of police officers in the country is greater than it has ever been, and the percentage of police to population is higher than it was before the war. There must obviously be a limit to thedemands which the police service can make on the available manpower and since the war great attention has been given to improving methods ofpatrolling and generally to the deployment of police to the best effect. this must include the allocation of a proportion of the force to traffic duties.
279The number of fatal and other serious accidents and the dislocation ofbusiness resulting from traffic congestion necessitate close attention by thepolice to traffic problems. Naturally every effort is made to give that attentionwithout interfering with the duty of the police to enforce the general criminal law and maintain order and the Government are satisfied that the police donot spend an undue amount of their time on traffic duties. Much progress,has also been made in the replacement of policemen by civilians on dutiesr which the powers of a constable are not required.9. There has been an increase in the complexity of crimes as well asin the ingenuity of criminals and of the means at their disposal. The facilityand speed of modern communications have revolutionised the technique of crime and made the task of detection more difficult. Police methods andequipment have been improved to match these developments. Individualforces have a much increased mobility. More and more cars and motor-cycles are now equipped with wireless, making possible a swift concentration of resources when necessary. The effectiveness of the whole police machinefor dealing with crime has been greatly improved by the provision of a highly developed system of inter-force communication. More efficientreporting and recording methods have been adopted. The scientific resources available to the police have been steadily developed and police forcesthroughout the country now have at their disposal forensic science laboratoriesto assist in the investigation of crime and to undertake research intoscientific methods of detection.The criminal law10. Closely related to the Governments duty to maintain the peace isits duty to ensure that the sanctions for the enforcement of the criminal law are adequate and that the machinery of the courts is such that theycan do their work effectively. The courts must have power to be severewhen severity is warranted. The Government considers that the necessarymeans to punish and deter are provided by the sanctions at present avail-able. These sanctions are heavier than is often supposed. All the more seriouscrimes can be punished with life imprisonment ; they include manslaughter,rape, robbery with violence, burglary and felonious wounding. Robberywithout aggravation, some forms of housebreaking and many forms oflarceny can be punished with 14 years&apos; imprisonment, and some lesserforms of violence or dishonesty with five years. These types of murderwhich particularly strike at public order and from which potential offendersare most likely to be deterred are still punishable by death, and other typesby life imprisonment. Persistent offenders can be sentenced to preventivedetention for up to 14 years. The superior courts have in these stringentpenalties ample powers to inflict severe punishment where punishment is a primary object, and magistrates&apos; courts have power, in relation to themore serious of the offences which they can try summarily, to commitoffenders to quarter sessions for sentence if they consider their own powersof punishment inadequate.11. The growth of crime has added greatly to the work of the criminalcourts, and in particular of courts of quarter sessions. In the higher courtsthe number of cases for trial doubled between 1938 and 1956. Since many ofthese courts sit only three or four times a year, one result has been a large increase in the number of persons who are committed in custody oncommittal for trial and remain in custody for a considerable period before being brought to trial. Since in recent years over one-third of the prisonersreceived in custody on committal for trial or on remand did not return to(31577)A 3
prison on conviction, but were otherwise dealt with by the court (apartfrom the minority who were found not guilty), the delays in bringing themto trial are a matter of concern.12. Another aspect of the work of the courts which needs to be examined is the procedure for obtaining information about offenders.Modern penal practice provides the courts with a wide range of methodsfrom which they may select that which is most likely to achieve IhJftLends of justice in relation to the individual offender. In doing so XaWcourt must take account mot only of the public effect of its decision but ofthe effect of that decision on the offender himself, that is to say, the likelihood of its preventing &apos;him from offending again. It is therefore necessary to providethe courts with such information about an offender as will enable them to judge what form of treatment will best serve these ends.13. The courts in many cases already have much information of thiskind before them ; but it is particularly difficult to assemble all the relevantmaterial and assess its value where the courts sit for short periods at longintervals, as the superior courts do in most parts of the country. Unlikemagistrates&apos; courts, which sit frequently, courts of assize or quarter sessionscannot conveniently remand offenders after conviction in order to obtainreports on their background and history and advice on the treatment thatis most likely to succeed in turning them from crime. The superior courtsmust normally proceed from conviction to sentence on the basis of such information as may have been supplied before the trial or can be madeavailable while they are in session. Where the accused has been committedon bail or has been in custody for only a short time, it is difficult, and oftenimpossible, to supply the court with adequate information.14. In order to examine, and if possible resolve, these difficulties the HomeSecretary and the Lord Chancellor have appointed a committee, under thechairmanship of Mr. Justice Streatfeild, to review the present arrangements in England and Wales:(a) for bringing to trial persons charged with criminal offences, and(b) for providing the courts with the information necessary to enableihem to select the most appropriate treatment for offenders, and toconsider whether, having regard to the desirability of ensuring thatcases are brought before the courts and disposed of expeditiously,any changes are required in these arrangements or in those for thedispatch of business by the courts ; and to report.Any recommendations that the Committee may make will be immediately and closely considered.15. One way of ensuring that the criminal law is effectively enforced isto ensure that its principles are clearly applied to the prevalent forms of crime as they change with changes in the pattern of society. In order thatthis may be done a Standing Committee on Criminal Law Revision is being appointed under the chairmanship of Lord Justice withthe following terms of reference:  &quot; To be a standing committee, to be known as the Criminal law revision Committee, to examine such aspects of the criminal law asthe Home Secretary may from time to time refer to the Committee, toconsider whether the law requires revision, and to make reeom-mendations.&quot;The first major subject which will be referred to the Committee is thelaw of larceny and kindred forms of fraud which has long been recognised to be in need of reform. The Committee is also being asked to consider how
best to fill the gap in the law disclosed by recent cases in which it has beenheld that a man who invites a child to handle him indecently does not commit indecent assault.The penal system16. The Governments responsibility does not end with ensuring that theefficiency of the police is maintained and that the courts are equipped withtdequate sanctions and machinery. Behind these first lines of defence the counter-attack on crime must be mounted. It is to the development of themeans of dealing with the individual offender who has been sentenced by thecourts to some form of detention that this paper is principally directed.It does not attempt to deal with other methods of treatment, such as probation,which are also widely used.II.-RESEARCH17. Delinquency cannot be dealt with effectively without more knowledgeof its causes and a more accurate measurement than we have at present ofthe success of the various forms of treatment. It is now widely recognisedthat in this field research is as essential as in the fields of science and technology.18. Research is not necessarily best conducted by official agencies. Theoutlook, training and environment of the academic worker give himadvantages in some kinds of research over the staff of a Government Depart-ment. On the other hand, a Department in daily practical touch with the realities of penal treatment, and with contacts and access to data not availableto outside workers, has its own distinctive contribution to make. The work that is being done and planned is therefore being shared between academicand official agencies working closely together. In this new advance, the HomeOffice has taken a lead. It has set up a Research Unit and assists from itsvote research work being done elsewhere.19. Research into the causes and prevention of delinquency is confronted with problems which are immense both in range and complexity. The causes of crime are varied ; heredity, environment and the unpredictable influencesto which the individual may be subjected all play their part. Although much is being done, there are no easy answers to these problems and progress is bound to be slow. The difficulties are not so great with research into theuse of the various forms of treatment and the measurement of their results,since this is concerned with matters that can be analysed more precisely.It is therefore on constructive work in this part of the field that specialemphasis is being put.20. The Home Office recently made enquiries of the Universities aboutthe research they had completed and had at present in hand. AppendixB to this Paper summarises the information thus obtained and the workon which the Research Unit is itself engaged. It will be seen that, apartfrom a number of special enquiries undertaken for administrative pur-poses, the Research Unit is at present studying the effectiveness of various forms of treatment when applied to different types of offender. An attempt is being made to measure the efficacy of treatment by comparing the numberof reconvictions of offenders who have been dealt with in different ways,after adjustments have been made for their varying characteristics and records.An essential part of research of mis kind is the identification of those charac-teristics of an offender that indicate whether a particular kind of treatmentv/ill be suitable for him. As a continuation of previous research of a531577 A 4
similar kind, records are being kept of all boys entering borstal institutions and they will be studied after discharge, together with information about any reconvictions, so that the relevant characteristics can be picked out and related to the likelihood of recidivism. Similar studies are being carriedout for other forms of treatment. Oxford, Cambridge and London universities-ties and the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations are, or have recentlybeen engaged, with Home Office support, in the study of particular fonjK^of treatment, including probation, prison, detention centres, and attendajpcentres, and of the psychological and sociological processes that take placewhen groups of men are brought together under prison conditions. A large-scale study of crimes of violence against the person in London is being madeby Cambridge University. Several other Universities are engaged inindependent research on delinquency, criminal law and the treatment of offenders.21. A good beginning has thus been made with the more intensivestudy of crime and criminals; but the field in which research must takeplace, in criminology as in any social science, is large and ill-defined, andopinions differ widely about the best routes to follow. The Research Unitwill apply the basic principles of scientific method and attempt to produceits results in quantitative terms. It will not cling to the methods of anyparticular discipline or school of thought, but will seek to provide answers to specific questions by whatever means appear most appropriate. Inco-operating with outside research workers by providing facilities or grants,the Home Office will similarly be guided only by the apparent suitabilityfor their purpose of the methods proposed to be used and the likelihood thatthe research will provide information in a form that can be used as a start-ing point for a further advance in knowledge. If this course is patientlypursued, it is hoped and believed that knowledge of crime and criminalswill increase to the point at which measures can be taken to bring about a real reduction in the amount of crime and still more effective treatment canbe given to each offender.22. There is not at present any agency outside the Home Office whichcan keep the whole problem under constant and critical survey ; which can keep track of what is being done ; and which can serve as a focus of con-structive thinking about delinquency in all its aspects. For this reason special importance attaches to the indication given by Cambridge University thatit is prepared, if the necessary funds can be made available, to considerthe establishment of an institute of criminology. The institute would be broadly based ; and it would be closely linked with all the faculties con-cerned in any aspect of the study of delinquency. It would necessarily haveto keep itself informed of all that is being done in the furtherance of thatstudy, both at home and abroad. Its purposes would be various. Itwould teach criminology, especially on the post-graduate level ; and it would undertake and encourage research on the highest academic standard. It would therefore not only itself contribute to our knowledge of criminology ; itwould help to produce the teachers of that subject, and the highly qualifiedresearch workers, who are at present so scarce. It would also, it may be hoped, be able from time to time to bring together groups of those concernedwith the administration of justice and the treatment of offenders. By doing soit would help to keep them abreast of current thought and the findings of research ; and it would at the same time strengthen its own contacts withthose doing the practical work of which it would study the results. Finally,the institute should be able, as no existing agency is in a position to do, to survey with academic impartiality in the light of the results of the researcheffort as a whole the general problem of the criminal in society, its causes and its solution.
III-THE DEVELOPMENT OF PENAL METHODSIntroduction23. Existing penal methods have of necessity been developed piecemealand empirically in response to experience and to the pressure of currentfoblems. Experience is always a valuable guide and the immediate problem:en an inescapable one, but in a society which changes as rapidly as oursmething more is needed if penal methods are to be related effectively tothe purposes which they are required to serve. We need periodically to con-sider whether existing methods are the best that can be devised for dealingwith crime in the context of society as it is at a given time. As crime is related.to the pattern and outlook of the society in which it occurs, so penalmethods may need to be adapted to the society in which they must operate.24. A fundamental re-examination of penal methods, based on studies of the causes of crime, or rather of the factors which foster or inhibit crime,and supported by a reliable assessment of the results achieved by existingmethods, could be a landmark in penal history and illumine the courseahead for a generation. Such a re-examination, though based on practicalstudies, need not and indeed should not be purely pragmatic. If it werenot merely to assess past progress, but also to point the way forward, itmust concern itself with the philosophy as well as the practice of punishment.It must consider the fundamental concepts underlying our treatment of offenders, and examine not only the obligations of society and the offenderto one another, but also the obligations of both to the victim. The basisof early law was personal reparation by the offender to the victim, a concept of which modern criminal law has almost completely lost sight. The assump-tion that the claims of the victim are sufficiently satisfied if the offender ispunished by society becomes less persuasive as society in its dealings withoffenders increasingly emphasises the reformative aspects of punishment.Indeed in the public mind the interests of the offender may not infrequentlyseem to be placed before those of his victim.25. This is certainly not the correct emphasis. Indeed one of the principalobjects of our penal system is to provide those deterrents which are necessaryto protect the citizens as a whole. It is also possible to hold that the redemptivevalue of punishment to the individual offender would be greater if it were madeto include a realisation of the injury he had done to his victim as well as tothe order of society, and the need to make personal reparation for that injury.If this concept of personal reparation to the victim were added to the conceptsof deterrence by punishment and of reform by training, our penal system would not only find a greater moral value but might still more effectivelyserve its purpose of protecting society against crime. The application of thisconcept to those sentenced to imprisonment could not be separated from the considerations affecting the level of a prisoners earnings which are discussed in paragraphs 73-74 below. Moreover, its realisation could be consideredonly in the context of a body of knowledge sufficient to sustain a generalre-examination of penal philosophy and practice.26. Latterly the view has been put forward that the obligation to the victimrests primarily on the society which has failed to protect him against crimeand can alone effectively compensate him. It was this view which led the lateMiss Margery Fry to propose a scheme for the payment of compensation tothose who suffered personal violence. This proposal presents many practicaldifficulties. Nevertheless the Government have decided to set up an official working party to examine the proposal in detail and see whether, if theprinciple were accepted, a workable scheme could be devised.
28427. This Paper illustrates how much there is still to be done. Existing formsof penal treatment, continuously adjusted in the light of deeper insight and greater information must be developed to the limit of the good we believe to be in them. Only when their potential power to turn men from crime hasbeen fully tested can we judge how far other methods may be required to reinforce and, if need be, to replace them.The Treatment of the Young Offender(a) Children and young persons28. The law relating to children and young persons (i.e. those who are under the age of 17 years and are dealt with by the juvenile courts) has alwaysbeen a matter of concern to the Government of the day and many changesin it have been made during the quarter century since the last major legisla-tion. In October, 1956, the Home Secretary appointed a committee underthe chairmanship of Viscount Ingleby to inquire into, and make recommenda-tions on, inter alia, the working of the law, in England and Wales, relatingto proceedings, and the powers of the courts, in respect of juveniles brought before the courts as delinquent or as being in need of care or protectionor beyond control; the constitution, jurisdiction and procedure of juvenilecourts; and the remand home, approved school and approved probationhome systems. The Committee are still receiving evidence and the Govern-ment await the outcome of their deliberations before considering what changes can or should be made in the methods of dealing with offenderscoming before the juvenile courts.(b) Young Adults29. The striking increase in crimes committed by young adults (i.e. thosebetween the ages of 17 and 21) emphasises the need for a review of the forms of penal treatment available for this age-group. It has long been recognised that the treatment of young adults ought to be provided ininstitutions separate from the prison system for adult offenders, and thatits emphasis must be on personal training. The Criminal Justice Act, 1948,sought to reduce the imprisonment of young adults by all courts, and eventually to abolish its use by magistrates&apos; courts. Section 17 of the Actprovided that no court should impose imprisonment on a person under21 unless it was of opinion that no other method of dealing with him was appropriate; courts of quarter sessions and magistrates&apos; courts were requiredto state the reason for their opinion, and magistrates&apos; courts in addition to specify the reason in the warrant of commitment. The immediate effectof section 17 was striking. In 1947 the number of male young offendersreceived under sentence of imprisonment was 2,572: in 1949 it was 1,187.30. As alternatives to the shorter sentences of imprisonment, the Actprovided two new forms of treatment attendance centres and detention centres. It also provided for the establishment of remand centres, to whichcourts might send persons aged 17-21 who would otherwise be remandedto prison, and those under 17 who were unsuitable for remand homes orin need of diagnostic examination which could not be given there. Whenthe Secretary of State is satisfied that adequate alternatives to imprisonmentare available to magistrates&apos; courts, the imprisonment by such courts ofpersons under the age of 21 may be prohibited by Order in Council.(1) Remand and attendance centres31. Financial restrictions have hitherto prevented the establishment of anyremand centres, but a site for the first has been obtained between manchester and Liverpool, and preliminary work will begin in 1959. Attendance centres
have been available for a number of years for young offenders under 17,and an experimental centre for the 17-21 age-group was opened in Manchesterin December, 1958.(2) Detention centresw 32. Detention centres were intended by Parliament to provide a sanctionrfc ir those who could not be taught to respect the law by such milder measuresfclas fines, probation and attendance centres, but for whom long-term residentialtraining was not yet necessary or desirable. In the first (junior) detentioncentre (Campsfield House, Kidlington, 1952 for boys aged 14 to 17)emphasis was placed on the elements of hard work, brisk tempo, andstrict discipline. From the outset, however, it was understood that thepurpose was not to frighten young offenders into well-doing, but to use these stricter elements as part of a reformative system in which a sympatheticstaff would make a real effort to find out what was wrong with a boyand put it right.33. It was realised that within the short period of the sentence, which is normally three months and only in exceptional cases up to six months,no such constructive all-round training as is possible in an approved school or borstal could be attempted; indeed boys in need of such training shouldnot be sent to detention centres. Nevertheless, with the growth of experience,and the addition first of a senior centre (Blantyre House, Goudhurst forboys aged 16 to 21) and later of another junior and another senior centre,the emphasis has gradually moved from the original conception of the&quot; short sharp shock &quot; towards that of a limited but positive form of training.From the outset, at the request of the Prison Commissioners, the experimentat the first two centres was followed by Dr. Max Grunhut, the Reader inCriminology at Oxford University. He has now completed a report basedon a study of 434 boys before, during and after treatment. Dr. Grunhut con-cludes that the results are encouraging, in terms both of reappearances incourt and of character improvement, and that the detention centre &quot; has a legitimate place in a variegated system of treatment for young offenders &quot;.There are now four detention centres and two more are planned. further development is discussed in paragraph 89.(3) Borstal34. The borstal system of institutional treatment for this age-group, asestablished by Part I of the Prevention of Crime Act, 190S, was not significantly changed by the Criminal Justice Act, 1948. Borstal trainingremains an indeterminate sentence with a minimum of nine months&apos; detentionand a maximum of three years. The total period of control extends to fouryears from the date of the sentence, the remainder of that period, afterrelease from the institution, being spent under the statutory supervision ofthe Central After-Care Association.35. Borstal is essentially a remedial and educational system, based on personal training by a carefully selected staff. Its development since the act of 1948 has been mainly in the extension of vocational training in skilledtrades and of education in its widest sense. During this period the institutionshave increased both in numbers and variety. They range from prison-typebuildings through those of medium security to the entirely open. To matchthese developments a system of classification, based on some weeks&apos; studyby a skilled diagnostic team, has been established in two reception centresat Latchmere House and Wormwood Scrubs.
(4) Imprisonment36. Sines over 1,000 young men under 21 are still sentenced to imprison -ment every year, it has been necessary to develop a separate system for deal-ing with them within the prison system. There are at present four prisons,or separate parts of prisons, set aside as young prisoners&apos; centres, to whichare sent all boys with sentences of three months or over, so far as accommsdation permits. One, at Wakefield, takes those with sentences of over thfyears who are not too sophisticated criminally. Of those sentenced to threeyears or less Lewes takes those who, if they were adults, would be placed inor with the Star Class*: Liverpool takes the remainder. Those with sentences of under three months (and in present conditions many with sentences ofmore than three months) must perforce remain in the unsuitable conditionsof the local prisons, as must all girls under 21, since their numbers are so small that no special centre could be provided for them. A section of the open prison at Eastchurch takes boys suitable for open training.37. The regime in these prison centres has been based on borstal principlesso far as is compatible with the security and atmosphere of a prison. it includes industrial training for those with long enough sentences ; physical,mental and moral education ; and personal attention from the staff, includingassistant governors who fill a similar role to that of borstal housemasters.(5) The present problem38. The system for the treatment of young adult offenders has been subjected to severe strains as a result of the great increase in crime in thisage-group. Detention centres are full and courts have been prevented fromcommitting offenders to a detention centre as an alternative to short-termimprisonment because no vacancy can be found. Offenders sentenced toborstal training have frequently had to wait in local prisons for as long as 12weeks before transfer to a borstal reception centre ; and many youngprisoners with sentences of three months or more, who are eligible for transfer to a young prisoners&apos; centre, have had to serve the whole of theirsentence in a local prison. To meet this situation four prisons have been converted into borstals during the last 12 months, and two more new borstalshave been provided by the adaptation of redundant service camps. It isalready clear that even on the present level of committals much more borstalaccommodation will be needed during 1959, and if the level of committalsincreases as much as it did in 1958, a critical situation may arise by theyear&apos;s end. Further, the rise in the birth-rate, which began during the war,is now beginning to affect the 16-21 age-group, and there is therefore everylikelihood that the number of young offenders committed to prisons, borstalsand detention centres will continue to increase.(6) The Prison Commissioners&apos; proposals39. Against this background it was thought desirable to institute a reviewof the existing methods of custodial treatment for young offenders, and certain proposals made by the Prison Commissioners have been referred by theSecretary of State to the Advisory Council on the Treatment of Offenders fortheir advice.40. The first part of these proposals looks to the early implementation ofthe intention of section 17 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1948 (see paragraph29 above). Far too many young people are still sent to prison for very short periods which must for the most part be spent in local prisons, where theconditions make it impossible to organise a form of training for young* See footnote to paragraph 48.
offenders which is both corrective and exacting. In 1957 about 1,000 boysand 100 girls received sentences of six months or less. In view of theencouraging results of the detention centres, and the manifest desire of manycourts to be able to use this form of treatment, it is proposed to accelerate the provision of more centres so that as soon as possible all sentences of six^months or less may be of detention and not of imprisonment.iS&apos; 41. The second part of the proposals is more novel and far-reaching.It seeks in effect, for sentences of over six months and under three years,to integrate borstal and imprisonment into a single system. To this endit proposes to provide a single indeterminate sentence of custodial training,with a maximum of two years, within which the offender may be releasedat any time after a minimum of six months on the same principles as nowgovern release from a borstal sentence, i.e., individual consideration basedon response to training and prospects of rehabilitation after release. Thosereleased would, as now, be subject to a period of statutory supervision andafter-care. For serious offences which merit a sentence of more than twoyears, it would be open to the courts to pass determinate sentences of threeyears (i.e., with remission, two years) and upwards.42. These proposals are based on several considerations.First, since experience with young prisoners&apos; centres has shown that itis possible to provide constructive treatment for young offenders in prisonsas well as in borstals, two separate forms of treatment are no longer needed.Nor does their existence add to the deterrent effect on young offenders. Mostyoung people prefer a prison sentence because it is likely to be much shorterthan a borstal sentence, and they know when they will get out. It is probablethat the knowledge that any sentence above six months will be an indeter-terminate two-year sentence would have a more generally deterrent effect thanthe present arrangements.Second, it is rarely possible, before trial, for either the administration orthe courts to know enough about young offenders to judge rightly what periodof training they need, or whether they will respond better to conditions of strict control such as prevail in prisons, or to one of the various types ofcontrol and training in the different kinds of borstal. So a certain numberof young persons are sent to prison who would benefit from a longer periodof borstal training, and a certain number to borstal whose needs would bebetter met by the stricter regime of a prison. Under the single sentenceproposal, each individual would after conviction be carefully studied at areception centre and allocated to that one of the wide range of institutions and regimes best suited to his individual needs, and the date of his releasewould be governed by an equally careful personal assessment.Third, it would be possible for the administration to make much more economical and advantageous use of the range of establishments available,and to transfer boys freely from one to another as their response to trainingrequired.43. Proposals on these lines have been considered by the Advisory Councilon the Treatment of Offenders, which has given them its general approval,subject to further examination of certain matters, and, in particular, of thequestion whether provision ought to be made for a different form of punish-ment for young offenders who commit further offences after serving oneindeterminate sentence of between six months and two years. The desirabilityof introducing legislation to implement these proposals will be considered in the light of the CoUncil&apos;s final report.
The Treatment of Adult OffendersThe task of the prisons44. The constructive function of our prisons is to prevent the largest possible number of those committed to their care from offending again.Since the report of the Gladstone Committee in 1895, it has been accepted that this end will not be reached by a regime designed simply to deterthrough fear. The object should be, in the words of that Committee,.-send the prisoners out &quot; better men and women, physically and morally, t&apos;Jwhen they came in&quot;. For a generation past our prisons have soughtincreasingly to give practical effect to this concept of the function of imprisonment, which was specifically endorsed by Parliament in Rule 6 ofthe Prison Rules made under the Criminal Justice Act, 1948, which runsas follows:  &quot; 6. The purposes of training and treatment of convicted prisonersshall be to establish in them the will to lead a good and useful lifeon discharge, and to fit them to do so.&quot;45. In the past ten years much progress has been achieved in the develop-ment of the prison system in face of the serious difficulties caused by a risingpopulation and consequent overcrowding, shortage of staff, shortage of workfor prisoners, and shortage of money for necessary capital expenditure. the size of the service has increased from 40 establishments in 1946 to 73 in1958. An extensive system of open prisons has been developed. Two newforms of treatment have been introduced for persistent offenders correctivetraining and preventive detention. The basis of classification has beenradically changed, and new types of prison with diversified functions havebeen developed to meet a variety of training needs.46. Methods of training have been progressively extended and improved,notably in the application of psychiatry and psychology, in the developmentof skilled industrial training, in getting prisoners out of their cells intoassociated activities, in the establishment in all prisons of evening educationinstitutes staffed by local education authority teachers, and in preparation for release through pre-release courses. The whole machinery of after-care hasalso been completely reorganised, and its local application entrusted ingeneral to the probation service. These and other developments were summarised in the Annual Report of the Prison Commissioners for 1955,and the story is brought up to date in their Reports for 1956 and 1957. It isnot therefore necessary to deal with them in detail in this Paper.47. Although steady progress has been made on these lines, the questionmay legitimately be asked: how far are the prisons effective in their declaredpurpose? The answer to this cannot, and could not in the present state of knowledge, be given on any scientific basis. It is possible to say that suchand such a percentage have not, over a given period of exposure to risk,returned to prison. But it is not possible to say whether that result is because of their treatment in prison, or in spite of it, or whether it wouldhave been the same if they had never come to prison. The following figures of reconvictions should be read in the light of this qualification.48. One test at least of the results of a prison system is its effect on those subjected to it for the first time. Statistics published in the annual report of the Prison Commissioners for 1957 show that some 87 per cent of men and 89 per cent of women of the Star Class * discharged from allprisons during 1953 and 1954 had not returned to prison under sentence* Prisoners aged 21 years and over who have not previously been in prison on convictionor, if they have, are not thought likely to have a bad influence on others.
by the end of 1957, i.e. after a period of at least three years&apos; exposure to risk. These figures, encouraging though they may appear, underline the cruxof the prison problem, that is, the treatment of those who do come back,and especially the hard core of persistent recidivists. The proportion ofprisoners received each year with six or more previous proved offences hasslowly increased over the last five years.f-^49. It is not possible to give for prisoners of the Ordinary (recidivist)J^iS reconvietion figures on the same comprehensive basis as are given above for Stars. Figures are, however, published by the Prison Commissioners fordischarges of .this class from certain specialised prisons. These suggest thatsome 66 per cent of men discharged from central prisons had not returnedto prison within three years ; for closed regional prisons the percentage is74 and for regional prisons of minimum or medium security it is much higher. These results, again, are not discouraging in themselves. But thegreat majority of prisoners of the Ordinary class must, in present conditions,serve their sentences in the local prisons where they cannot receive thetraining available in the specialised prisons50. A second question, which is very pertinent at a time when crimeis increasing, is whether these more humane and constructive methods oftreatment may have been applied at the expense of the deterrent effectof imprisonment. So far as concerns general deterrence, that is, the effectof the fear of prison on all who may be minded to commit offences, it is notpossible to distinguish fear of imprisonment as a particular form of punish-ment from fear of the total action of the penal system. There is at least no evidence that fear of imprisonment in itself has any less effect than it mayhave had in the past on those who have not yet been in prison. As for thosewho have already served a first sentence, it must again be noted that thegreat majority do not in fact return to prison. For those who do return,there is no reason to believe that an increasingly repressive regime would havea better effect. The deterrent effect of imprisonment must finally lie in theloss of personal liberty and all that this involves under any kind of regime,and that effect is not reinforced if the period of loss of liberty is used in amerely repressive and punitive way. This was the conclusion reaohed by theGladstone Committee, after long experience of a system firmly based onpunitive deterrence, and nothing in the experience of the last sixty years has pointed to a different conclusion.51. The problems of recidivism must be approached in other ways. Wemust through continued research learn more of its causes. Through more precise methods of classification and continual search for improved techniqueswe must seek to reduce recidivism by more effective personal training. Wemust recruit staff of the right quality and train them to understand and applythese new methods. And we must have enough suitable buildings in which to do these things.The state of the local prisons52. In spite of the development of specialised prisons and of an extensiveopen prison system, the great majority of men sentenced to imprisonment whoare not serving a first sentence have to serve their sentences in the generallocal prisons  the former county gaols in grossly overcrowded conditions and without adequate facilities for work or training.53. Of some 15,000 men now serving sentences of imprisonment, only about 4,000 (of whom over 3,000 are serving first sentences) are in central orregional or open prisons. The remainder are in the local prisons. these include Ordinary prisoners with sentences of less than five years for whom
there is no room in Dartmoor, the only central prison available for this class of prisoner. Even men with sentences of five years or more maywait 20 months to go to Dartmoor, and the pressure on all forms of accommodation is so intense that many other categories, young and old,have to wait far too long in local prisons before they reach the prisonto which they are allocated.54. These local prisons, holding more prisoners than they have ever he!before, now have to house some 6,000 men sleeping three in a single ceMoreover, they are in themselves quite unfitted to modern conceptions ofpenal treatment, built as they were 100 years or more ago to serve thepurposes of solitary confinement, treadmill hard labour and brutal repres-sion. They stand as a monumental denial of the principles to which weare committed.55. The difficulties of the local prisons are accentuated by the fact thatthey house not only men and in a few prisons women sentenced to imprisonment, but many other classes of prisoner. There are both adultand young prisoners awaiting trial or on remand ; men imprisoned forfailure to pay their debts or to maintain their wives; young prisoners withsentences of less than three months; borstal inmates awaiting transfer to a borstal reception centre; and preventive detention prisoners and correc-tive trainees awaiting transfer to central and training prisons. The serviceof the courts and the continued changes in the population, with all the workwhich this involves for the staff, and the need to segregate different classesof prisoner make it very difficult to give any form of positive training.56. Apart from the gross overcrowding* of this very mixed population inunsuitable buildings, another serious disadvantage from which these localprisons suffer is shortage of work, which is fully discussed in paragraph 66.Nothing is more demoralising than idleness in an overcrowded prison.The future of the local prison57. The essence of the problem is that the local prisons have to performtoo many specialist functions for which they are not adequately equipped,of which the most important are the examination of untried prisoners, the classification of the convicted and the training of offenders serving substantialsentences of imprisonment.58. The examination of untried prisoners and the preparation of reportsfor the information of the courts requires specialist staff and suitableconditions for observation. It should be performed in establishments designed for the purpose and staffed by experts in the various diagnostic methods.The same is true of the classification of convicted offenders and theirallocation to the type of prison which will best suit their training needs.Consideration has been given to the development of a system of classificationbased not merely on objective criteria, such as the length of the offenderssentence and his penal record, but also on a study of the offenderspersonality. Such a system, however, cannot be fully developed until suitableestablishments are available.59. It will be necessary to build a number of observation and classifica-tion centres for these purposes, which will be adjacent to the remand centresto be set up for young persons (paragraph 30), and will use the samediagnostic staff. When these are available, observation and classification will no longer be among the functions of the local prison.* There is no overcrowding in the women&apos;s prisons; indeed these in general are not nearlyfull. Nor is there shortage of work.
60.. A more, refined, systerri.of.classification and allocation would, be., atAO value, withoutusuitable.;establishrrients:in which..prisoners, particularlyrecidivists with medium-length sentences,: can:..be,-giyeq: the. type of trainingwhich, they require;and,which cannot tie adequately -provided,in the localisons. To,meet this need it will be necessary to build a number of additionallining prisons.61. It would then be possible to reduce the population of the localprisons so as to allow one or more of them at a time to be emptied for reconstruction; Most of these buildings could then be turned into prisonswhich, while falling short of the ideal, would at least be. reasonably welladapted to requirements, on the assumption that long sentences were nolonger served-there.- The cells eould be modernised, with larger . windowssuch as - are provided in the new prisons under construction. Ranges ofclassrooms for education and suitable i rooms for dining and recreationcould be provided. Workshop-accommodation could be improved. Sanitationcould be modernised, and modern facilities for family visits provided.This would be a long-term programme, spread over many years, but very well worth while. Proposals for a building programme are developed in chapter IV below.6-2. The local prisons would then-.be-in a position to, do, what they oughtto-be doing now to provide an effective training-programme, for;prisonerswith shorter&apos; sentences. It should no longervbe*.necessary to say;that-evena sentence of-six months or-less can-have no constructive value. The PrisonCommissioners have * for some time been experimenting with. &quot;-inductionunits&quot;,- which aHow the newly -received^prisoneri-to^be. kept apart for twoor three weeks from- the-maim prison while knowledge of-him is gained andhis classification considered. In this -way, too^-he learns-i&apos;about.his^future and what prison will mean to him before he joins the main body ; and heis also given the feeling that the staff take an interest in him as an individual.Although; in Rresent conditions this idea cannot be generally adopted, thereis no doubt-that an &quot;induction unit&quot; should be a feature of the localprison of the future.63. The remainder;.of- the prison .could then be organised in- separatewings providing for differing training categories. Prisoners might be dividedaccording to the length of their, sentence, or they might -progress from onecategory ta another, or both systems rnight be combined. In one largeLondon prison, a separate wing has for some time been set aside for selectedmen. who; have reached a, certain stage, of their sentence, Here supervisionis more informai, an excellent relationship has been established between staff and prisoners,. and the training value is thought to be high. In the largestprisons^ some of which now hold over 1,000 prisoners, it may well be thatreconstruction should include some form of sub-division into units of amore manageable size.64v A..Jocal.prison so reorganised, with an adequate staff and enoughwvork\of SHJtabje quality, would no longer be,.,a place where a prisoner mustbe,,;left because,there is. nowhere else to send him,&apos;but.a training unit towhich he is allocated because that is the right place for him.Vork65. iOffendejiS do.-not.come to prison; jbecause they have,failed,as-workmen,^nd: the, tajski ofi the: prison, is -to train (the whple inxan,;-. a . prison is . not therefore, and should not be,r,first and&apos; ^ojemost a factory.

fills the greater part of his day, and his response to it and to the conditionsin which he has to do it may well affect his response to other forms oftraining. It should therefore be obviously purposeful, efficiently organised,and carried out so far as possible in conditions similar to those in outsideworkshops. It should at least enable him to acquire habits of regular and orderly industry, and at best give him a trade skill which he can use whenhe goes out. Above all, there should be enough of it to keep him busy for full working day, week in and week out.66. In the central and regional training prisons these ideals have been largely fulfilled, but in the local prisons the situation has long been badand is deteriorating. There are not enough workshops ; the working hoursare too short; there is not enough work to fill even those hours efficiently ;and too much of the work is of low industrial quality. Work such as themaking and repairing of mailbags, which is not unsuitable for some prisonerswhen done on machines, has had to be done by hand while the machinesstand idle, in order to make the limited orders for work last. There are,however, no prisoners for whom employment in this limited sense is not found ; and all the work, whatever its quality, is useful at least in the sense that it is necessary. But great efforts have been needed to achieve this result;and there is much to be done to bring about an improvement.67. It will be necessary to build many more workshops in the local prisonsto provide both for the increased population and for a better class of industry.Increasingly, as the training purpose of local prisons is emphasised, more workof real industrial training value will be needed. Simple work of low industrialvalue will still be necessary for those with very short sentences and thosewho are physically or mentally handicapped ; but there must be enough ofthis to fill a good working day at a reasonable industrial tempo and by methods that are not obviously inefficient.68. Contracts for Government Departments are the main source of work inprisons, apart from the manufacture of equipment for prisons and borstals,their domestic services, and the maintenance of their buildings and grounds.The revision of the defence programme has greatly reduced the volume oforders placed with the Prison Commission and other priority suppliers, andnew arrangements have recently been made for regular consultation betweenpurchasing departments and the priority suppliers, with a view to increasingthe variety and quantity of orders from Government Departments. Theproblem is not a new one. Over a hundred years ago Elizabeth Fry said:&quot; The benefit which society derives from the employment of criminals greatlyoutweighs the inconvenience which can possibly arise to the mass of ourlabouring population from the small proportion of work done in the prisons... it should be a regular thing, undertaken by Government, consideringthat there are so many to provide for ; there is the Army and the Navy andso many things required for them &quot;.69. With the co-operation of employers&apos; organisations and the TradeUnion Congress, a drive has been made to extend what is the normal system on the Continent the use of prison labour on contracts from outsideindustries. Work for some 1,300 men has so far been found in this way. Atone time some 1,000 men were also employed outside the prisons on varioususeful projects of public value, such as agriculture, land drainage, highwayworks and forestry. Unhappily in recent years this form of work, though ofgreat social value both to the prisoners and to the community, has dwindledto small proportions, in part on account of difficulties felt by certain of theTrade Unions concerned, and, more recently, owing to growing unemploy-ment in some areas. The Prison Commissioners will make every effort to
obtain more work from outside employers, to be done both inside and outsideprisons. In all these matters they are now assisted by the appointment ofan experienced industrialist, in a voluntary capacity, as Industrial Adviser.70. They will also continue to develop vocational training courses inskilled trades designed to enable the trainees to take the examinations ofthe City and Guilds of London and other recognised examining bodies. Attrecent date there were in the various prisons 73 classes covering 25ifferent trades. The standard of training was such that in a year over 350men were able to enter the external examinations, with over 70 per centpasses and 30 distinctions or credits. The introduction of more such trades in the central and training prisons will allow trades of secondary trainingvalue to pass to the local prisons.71. The solution of the problems of work in prisons does not rest withthe administration alone. Indeed, they will never be solved until societyas a whole accepts that prisons do not work in an economic vacuum, andthat prisoners are members of the working community, temporarily segre-gated, and not economic outcasts.Earnings72. The acceptance of this view would entail some reassessment of theprinciples affecting the payment of prisoners for the work they do. In thiscountry, before the war, the system had been adopted of making payments,known as &quot; earnings&quot;, which though trifling in themselves were found toserve as a substantial incentive to prisoners to work faster and better. Thissystem, with minor adjustments, has continued to the present time withoccasional increases in the average level, which is now about 2s. 8d. a week.It not only provides an incentive to effort, but also allows the prisoner tohave something to spend which he has earned, and to think about how he shall spend it. This has a training value in more than one way. It does, forexample, allow the prisoner the opportunity, rare in a prison, to do somethingunselfish for somebody else. It is remarkable how much of these small sumsis spent in the canteens on Christmas and birthday cards, or on chocolatesfor the children when they visit.73. Nevertheless, a system under which a week&apos;s hard work by a goodworkman may not earn him the price of a packet of cigarettes is hardlyconsistent with the view of the prisoner as an ordinary member of theworking community ; for this reason, it has often been suggested that a prisoner should be paid &quot; the economic rate for the job &quot;. This means thathe should receive wages on the same basis as workers outside, and out ofthem should pay for his keep in prison, maintain his dependents, keep up his social insurance contributions, save a fixed proportion for use on release,and retain the balance for personal spending in prison. In favour of thisscheme it can be argued that it would make for greater self-respect and self-responsibility, for greater interest and industry at work, and for a stronger position on release. It ought also to make it easier for prison industry to beaccepted as a normal part of the national economy, since prisoners wouldthen be employed in conditions similar to those of free industry.74. This proposal is at present under consideration by the United Nations,and it is clear that, apart from the many practical and economic difficulties,there are important questions of principle involved. For example, wouldsuch a system really contribute to a prisoners training by encouragingresponsibility and the faculty of choice, since he would have little realcontrol over the disposal of his earnings? And what would be the, moralbasis of such a system if it were not linked with changes in the law which
-    294would enable prisoners also to be required to make restitution from their earnings to the victims of their offences (paragraph 25)? It is significant thatin spite of the recommendations of international congresses no country yetappears to have made any significant progress towards this end, and thereport of the United Nations enquiry will be awaited with interest. But what-ever conclusions may be reached on the conflicting arguments of principle,it seems clear that this conception of the &quot; economic rate &quot; cannot provide.a general solution of the prison earnings problems until the general level of productivity and efficiency of prison industry approximates much more closely to that of outside industry. Meanwhile there may well be scope forinteresting experiments on a limited scale in this direction: among these thescheme now being developed (paragraph 80) under which prisoners in thelast six to nine months of long sentences go to work in outside industry atnormal wages, which are disposed of precisely as proposed under the&quot; economic rate &quot; plan, conforms with the general principles of this plan.Psychiatric and psychological services75. Whether it be for diagnostic work for the information of the courts and for purposes of classification, or for the mental care and treatment ofinmates under sentence, a modern prison service requires an adequate andspecialised service of doctors with psychiatric experience, psychologists, andsuch other qualified persons as go to make a psychotherapeutic team. Duringthe period since the war it has been possible to make much progress in these directions. Three psychiatric clinics, with a qualified medical staff, visitingpsychotherapists, and psychiatric social workers have been set up for menand women at Wormwood Scrubs, Wakefield, and Holloway. To theseare transferred any inmates who in the opinion of the Medical Officer would benefit by psychiatric treatment. At Wormwood Scrubs the method ofgroup-therapy is fully employed, including the technique of psychodrama.Where necessary patients are sent for treatment to outside psychiatric hos-hospitals. For cases in which, owing to shortness of sentence or otherwise,psychotherapy cannot be undertaken in prison, arrangements have been madefor Regional Hospital Board consultants to see the inmates with a view totreatment after release. There is also a complete psychological service.Psychologists are employed in the three centres where the examination and classification of borstal inmates and persistent offenders are carried out;at the more important local prisons, where they assist governors and medical officers in making reports to the courts; at Wormwood Scrubs, Wakefieldand Holloway where they assist in the psychotherapeutic work and other-wise ; and generally in all establishments in which they are employed theymay be called on to advise on the treatment of troublesome inmates or inother ways for which their qualifications fit them.76. Much more remains to be done, and for this the requisites are, asin other fields, more buildings and more staff, Work will be starting shortlyon a psychiatric prison hospital, at Grendon Underwood, Bucks. When thisis ready, the major psychotherapy now carried out at the three clinics willbe concentrated in one place where, in proper conditions, it can be extendedin scope and deepened in value. But the value of psychiatry is not limitedto the treatment of those abnormal states of mind which require the kindof psychotherapy that will be given in the new establishment. A psychiatric-ally experienced doctor can do much to help disturbed prisoners not onlyto adjust themselves to prison life but also to change their general attitudesso that they make a better adjustment in society after release. This kind of help ought to be available in most of the larger prisons at all times. Whathow stands in the way is first, the shortage of otherwise qualified candidates
for the prison medical service who have psychiatric qualifications and experi-ence, and this again is to some extent a reflection of the general shortage of qualified psychiatrists: second, the fact that the greater part of the time of themedical officers in local prisons must now be spent on work for the courts.V/hen the proposed remand and observation centres are established, themedical officers in the ordinary prisons may hope to be free to devote muchmore of their time to the mental care of those prisoners whom they canbielp. The present psychiatric clinics will continue their work with a different^emphasis, and that kind of work will extend to other large prisons. Thepsychologists will also be free to devote a much greater part of their skillto a constructive part in the general pattern of training. It is to be hopedthat when these developments are complete the prison medical service willbe seen to offer a field of work much more attractive to the well-qualifiedpsychiatrist than at present.Preventive Detention77. Any review of the methods of dealing with recidivism must includepreventive detention for persistent offenders in the new form introduced bythe Criminal Justice Act. 1948. It is too soon to say whether this is achieving the results that Parliament lhad in mind when they were established. Researchis already being conducted by the Research Unit into the use of preventivedetention, which it is hoped will throw considerable light both on the usemade by the courts of this form of treatment and on the results which ithas achieved. When the research has been completed it will be necessaryto give very careful consideration to the whole concept of preventive detentionand, should it be felt right to maintain it, to the detailed provisions underwhich it is carried out. It has been suggested, for example, that more people who are still relatively young have been sentenced to preventive detentionthan was originally contemplated ; and that others, though they have longcriminal records, have not been guilty of offences of the more serious kind.Should research show these suggestions to be well-founded, it may benecessary to reconsider both the age at which a prisoner should become liableto preventive detention and the criminal record which should justify his beingsentenced to undergo it.78. Apart from this, it will be necessary to review, in the light of experience, certain features of the preventive detention regime which were introduced on its inception in 1949 in an attempt to meet the special problemspresented by this form of sentence. These turn mainly on the form of the stage system, particularly the arrangements for entry to the third stage,which enable prisoners specially selected by an independent Advisory board to be released after they have served two-thirds of their sentence instead ofthe normal five-sixths.Discharge and after-care79. It has been said with truth that it is easy to imprison a man ; the difficult thing is to release him. Especial attention must therefore be devotedfirst to preparing prisoners for release, and then to ensuring that the difficu 1transition from closed institutional life to free life in society is eased andguided. For many men and women the effort spent in prison will be wastedunless they can receive this help.80. Especially for those who have served long sentences behind the wallsof closed prisons, the sudden step to freedom may be dangerous unless theeffects of institutional life can be tapered off, and preparation given for the many problems to be faced on release. So at all prisons pre-release courses
-    296are held, at which experts from outside come to hold an open forum withprisoners nearing their release on all the domestic, social and industrialproblems with which they will be faced. For men and women with longsentences arrangements are being made to develop the system which already exists for preventive detainees by which specially selected men are allowedto work in civilian jobs outside the prison walls during the last months of.their sentence. Eight hostels are being established at or in connection witprisons in towns where the employment situation is hopeful. Here theywill live, during the last six months or so of the sentence, as much as possiblelike free men, working in the town and drawing their wages like ordinaryworkmen. They will pay for their board and lodging, maintain their families,and save towards their release. It may be hoped that experience will leadto a wider extension of this interesting experiment.81. For some years release on parole has been extensively used in a variety of ways, including the system of home leave, which forms animportant aspect of pre-release training. Many categories of prisoners, withsentences of two years and over, are eligible towards the end of theirsentences for five days leave to enable them to make family adjustments,see prospective employers, and meet their future after-care supervisor. Thissystem, which has proved most successful and advantageous, will be graduallyextended as experience suggests.82. In 1951 a joint committee of the National Association of DischargedPrisoners&apos; Aid Societies and the Prison Commissioners, under the chairman-ship of Sir Alexander Maxwell, recommended that, in view of the materialbenefits available to prisoners through the welfare services of the State, AidSocieties should reduce the emphasis they had traditionally placed onimmediate material aid and develop and deepen their interest in meeting theindividual needs of selected prisoners not subject to statutory after-care. Toassist the societies, the Committee proposed that well-qualified Prison welfare officers should be appointed at local prisons as employees of the national association of Discharged Prisoners Aid Societies. At the present time eight of these new Prison Welfare Officers have been appointed at five prisons,and it is hoped that their services will be extended to all local prisons assoon as possible. With their co-operation, the local Aid Societies must be encouraged to seek new ways to deepen and widen their new task of assisting the social rehabilitation of those who need and can profit by this help.83. The Criminal Justice Act, 1948, extended to several categories ofpersons discharged from custody provision for statutory after-care, based onconditional release to the care of an approved society. To meet these obligations the Central After-Care Association was created to act as the approved society for all the purposes of the Act. At the same time provision was made for the field-work of statutory after-care to be undertaken bythe only nation-wide network of qualified social case-workers available todo it the probation service.84. There has been considerable development in the range of bothvoluntary and statutory after-care and it was recently thought desirable to review the results and to consider whether further changes or extensions ofthe present system were desirable. The Advisory Council on the Treatmentof Offenders were asked to consider the general question of compulsoryafter-care for prisoners on their release, and, if they decided that it was an advantage that there should be such after-care, to advise on the categories of prisoners to which it should be applied, and the sanctions by which itshould be enforced. The Council&apos;s report has now been published.5&quot; They* The After-Care and Supervision of Discharged Prisoners (H.M. Stationery Office, 2s. 6d.)
agree with the overwhelming weight of opinion before them that for certainprisoners compulsory after-care is a necessary complement to prison training.They feel that the disadvantage of its alienating those prisoners who wouldresent any form of compulsion on release is out-weighed by the benefit derivedby those who need it but do not accept it voluntarily. They have accordingly recommended its extension, as resources allow, to a number of categories to^which it does not at present apply. They make also a number of practicalrecommendations about the methods of its operation, the period for which itshould continue, and the means by which it should be enforced. these recommendations are being sympathetically studied.IV. THE BUILDING PROGRAMME85. The Prison Commissioners are faced with a building programme offormidable dimensions and great urgency. The need for it derives from two separate causes.86. In the first place, as has been shown, the existing buildings do not provide enough room for those who are now being sent for training. Evenif there were removed from the local prisons all the untried prisoners andthe 2,000 men, now unsuitably housed there, who are serving sentences ofover three years, on the present level of committals 1,500 men would still have to sleep three in a cell. This fact illustrates a degree of overcrowdingwhich cannot be tolerated and which makes effective classification andtraining quite impracticable.87. Secondly, training is also gravely hampered by the physical conditionof many of the existing buildings and the lack of the specialist facilities which modern techniques require. To have to work in prisons which arevirtually unchanged since they were built in the nineteenth century or earlier,when the whole emphasis was on security and deterrence, does not invitefrom either the staff or the prisoners the response to modern methods of constructive training which is necessary if they are to succeed. It is no morepossible to train prisoners in these obsolete conditions than it would be toprovide a twentieth century system of education in antiquated schools or tocarry out modern hospital treatment in the unimproved buildings of thepre-Victorian era. Nor can we hope to attract the sort of staff we need if their living and working conditions are below a normal modern standard,and if they lack the accommodation and amenities which a good employernow regards it as his duty to provide. A building programme planned inrelation to modern requirements is therefore a pre-requisite of progress.88. The first need is for remand and observation centres (see paragraphs30 and 58-59). At least seven centres of this kind are necessary.89. Second, in order to implement the policy for the treatment of young offenders which is outlined in Part III, more detention centres and moretraining establishments are required. Six detention centres (four of themcompleted) are in the present programme. Another six must be built. Anadditional borstal reception centre for 350 boys, three secure borstals, eachfor some 200 boys, a secure borstal for 96 girls, and four open borstals forboys are in progress or planned ; such additional borstals, open and closed,as the needs disclose will have to be provided.90. The prison programme is even greater. The special problem of thelocal prisons has already been discussed. The present programme includestwo secure prisons, each for 300 men, and a psychiatric prison hospital. One
prison at Everthorpe has been completed, but has had to be appropriatedtemporarily for borstal boys. Additional security prisons will be requiredfor at least 1.800 men serving long sentences.91. Three special projects will also have to be considered in the nextfew years. The first is a modern prison, or prisons, for women to take theplace of the unsuitable early-Victorian building at Holloway : this vw,already planned in 1938, but had to be abandoned after the war. Twj*!second is an establishment in which it will be possible to provide, withinthe framework of a high degree of security, a suitable regime for dangerousprisoners serving very long sentences. The third is the complete reconstruction of DartmoOr, which is approaching the end of its serviceable life.92. No summary of the building programme would be complete withouta reference to housing. If the prison service is to attract recruits, and ifofficers are to do their work satisfactorily, their families must be properlyhoused. Since the war 2,550 new houses have been built and 650 modernised.The present programme includes 1,000 new houses and the modernisation of 625 others. And there will still be a programme of about 2,000 houses,including quarters for future new establishments and the replacement ofcertain prefabricated temporary quarters.93. In summary, it is clear that a programme of new buildings to meeteven the present and known needs of the service should include, over and above the programme already planned as shown at A below, at least therequirements shown at B below.A. Present programme  security prisons each for 300 men (one completed).1 psychiatric prison hospital.1 remand and observation centre.3 secure borstals each for up to 200 boys.1 secure borstal for 96 girls.4 open borstals for boys.1 borstal reception centre for 350 boys.6 detention centres for boys (four completed).1,000 new houses and modernisation of 625 houses.B, Future ProgrammeSecurity prisons sufficient to accommodate at least 1,800 men servinglong sentences.A security prison for dangerous prisoners serving long sentences.Accommodation for women in place of Holloway.Remand and observation centres sufficient to accommodate all untriedprisoners and such convicted prisoners as require observation before being classified.6 detention centres.Such additional borstals, open and closed, as the needs disclose.A programme of reconstruction for the local prisons.Reconstruction of Dartmoor prison.2,000 new houses.
94. All this will cost a great deal of money and will take some time. Butthe urgency is accepted and the work will be done as resources become available. Even if the programme was complete today there would still be over 1,500 men sleeping three in a cell in local prisons ; and until it is complete other steps must be taken to find more room to relieve congestion and improve classification and training. There is only one way of doing ittby increasing the numbers placed in open prisons, which can be moreickly and cheaply obtained. There is no doubt that open prisons have great advantages. They are extremely economical both to acquire and adapt,and require less staff than closed prisons: they are also a most effectiveinstrument of training. The English prison service has since the war gainedan extensive experience of open prisons, but has properly placed the publicinterest first by exercising great care in the selection of men for this&quot; formof treatment. In consequence only a very small proportion of the prisonpopulation is in fact being treated in these conditions. It may weil bethat, without losing sight of the public interest, sheer necessity will compelsome relaxation of the strict criteria hitherto in force.V.-STAFF95. The aim of the prison service is to develop methods to &quot; fit the prisoners to lead a good and useful life on release&quot;, and to establish an environment in which the prisoners will be likely to co-operate willinglyin their training, with the feeling that the purpose is to foster rather thancrush their sense of self-respect and self-responsibility. But such ends willfinally be attained not by buildings, or rules or even ideals, but by people;what will count more than anything will be&apos; the quality of those who are setover the prisoners, and the kind of relationship that exists between prisoners and staff, not least the ordinary prison officers who are in daily and hourlycontact with them. Moreover it is even more important to &quot; establish the will&quot; to lead a good and useful life than to fit a man to do so. Itis little use training a man to be a good workman if he cannot be madeto want to be a good workman. This part of the training, which may be described as the treatment of states of mind, the changing of attitudes, orin many other ways, is again essentially personal work. It involves or may involve every member of the staff, and therefore involves the need for thewhole staff to learn to work together for a common end in which every member appreciates not only his own part but that of all the others.96. Here mention must be made of the increasing development of specialised functions in prisons. What may be called the lay side is broadlybased on the prison officers in their various grades, but these too include manyspecialists with different contributions to make to training, e.g. hospitalofficers ; cooks and bakers ; physical education instructors ; works officers ;trade instructors though instruction in many of the more skilled trades isin the hands of specially recruited civilian instructors. Above them arethe governors, deputy-governors, and assistant governors, while the stewardand his executive and clerical staff help everybody by ensuring the smoothworking of the prison management. On the more specialised professional and.technical side, the influence of religion must still be brought to bear primarily by the chaplains and ministers of religion, though their work may be helped by the general atmosphere in the prison and among its staff. The doctorhas an important part to play both as physician and as psychiatrist. Thepsychologist, the tutor-organiser and the welfare-officer must all be thought of as part of the &quot; training team &quot;- And there are others outside the prison staffproper who may play a valuable part, notably the prison visitors and the visiting teachers.
-    30097. To help towards this team spirit three measures in particular havebeen taken in recent years. First, the setting up at every establishment ofconsultative committees on which every section of the staff is represented.Second, an arrangement by which all new members who do not attend oneof the normal initial training courses go to the Staff Training School at Wake-field for a two-day induction into the service. Third, an annual course oftwo weeks for all new assistant-governors and specialists so that each maj*kunderstand the contribution of the various skills employed in the treatment&quot;of prisoners.98. While the relationship between officers and prisoners has long been on a satisfactory and constructive basis in the open prisons and in train-ing prisons in general, this has not been the case in all prisons. In the localprisons especially, in the difficult conditions earlier described, the tensionsresulting from the traditional opposition between prisoners and staff have remained. In 1956 an experiment was started at Norwich prison to see whether by certain changes of routine and method, coupled with a freshapproach by the staff to their relationship with the prisoners, two objectsmight be attained. First, a relaxation of these tensions, second a feeling among the whole of the staff that each of them had a personal and construc-tive part to play in the rehabilitation of the prisoners in their charge. Withthe full co-operation of the staff, these objects were achieved with no lossof fundamental discipline and control, and this system has now been extended to the smaller local prisons and is spreading upwards through thelarger.99. It must be recognised that, especially among recidivist prisoners withlong criminal histories, whose attitudes have evidently not been changed by many previous forms of treatment, this approach involves a type of socialcasework of an exceptionally difficult kind. If this is to be tackled by menwho have, in general, no previous qualifications or training in such work, itis necessary to give them, so far as possible, the necessary techniques. steps have already been taken to provide training in case-work for the assistant-governor grades. New techniques such as group therapy on the medical side and group discussion on the lay side are also being developed. In this con-nection the research projects now being carried out into the structure andgroup reactions of the prison community are of great interest and importance.The development of techniques above mentioned must depend on a muchmore informed appreciation of these fundamental problems of prisonmanagement.100. To sum up, it is not too much to say that the success of the system will, finally, depend on the quality of the staff which will administer it.&quot;A school is a teacher with a building round him, not a building with ateacher inside.&quot; To obtain such a staff three things are necessary.101. In the first place, their pay and other material conditions of service,including their living and working conditions, must be such as are likelyto attract and retain in the service men and women of the quality required.The conditions of service of the prison officer and governor grades had notbeen comprehensively reviewed for over thirty years, and a DepartmentalCommittee was recently set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Wynn-Parry to study these matters. The Committee made valuable suggestions aboutthe qualifications, training and standards of remuneration which in their view will give the Prison and Borstal Service the men it needs. These theGovernment have, for the most part, accepted. The Committee&apos;s report*stresses the special nature of the prison and borstal officer&apos;s function, and the difficult conditions under which he has to work. He must combine a high* Report of the Committee on Remuneration and Conditions of Service of Certain grades in the Prison Service (Cmnd. 544-H.M. Stationery Office, 2s. 6d.)
VI.-CONCLUSION104. In dealing with problems arising out of human behaviour we cannotplan with certainty. New knowledge and experience of new methods maylead us to abandon principles which have seemed well established ortechniques that have held great promise. We must always be ready toexperiment and to adjust our thinking realistically according to the outcome.But there are many things we can do that are bound to be of value whateverchanges come about. It is with these essential things, as well as with newideas that ought to be urgently and frankly examined, that this Paper hasdealt.105. The Paper indicates the problem with which crime confronts us andthe agencies which exist to deal with it. Reference is made to plans for newlyconceived research and for the establishment of an Institute of Criminology.The Paper looks forward to the possibility of instituting schemes for com-compensating the victim and stresses the need for considering his plight. proposals are made for adjusting the treatment of young offenders, which would introduceas a deterrent a fear of stricter punishment, and would at the same time give to the Prison Commissioners wider discretion than at present exists in dealingwith individual offenders. These would require legislation. The proposals made in a later part of the Paper for statutory after-care would also require legislation. Indication is given that such prominent features of the criminla justice Act. 1948, as those concerned with preventive detention are under examination. In view of the variety and intricacy of the various proposalsearlv legislation is not contemplated. It is hoped rather that the publicationof the Paper will concentrate criticism and comment on the form which any fresh legislation may take.106. It is made clear in the portions of the Paper dealing with the adultoffender that much depends on improved classification of prisoners, of whichthe provision of more and better buildings is a prerequisite. For the first time a forward building programme is set out in Part TV. Similarly for thefirst time for 35 years the pay and conditions of service of the prison staff havebeen reviewed by Mr. Justice WynTi-Parry&apos;s Committee, whose recommenda-tions are referred to in paragraph 101.107. Much of what is required is costly and will take time. But theGovernment are determined to press on as resources allow with the stepsthey believe to be necessary if the courts are to have at their disposal thebest means of rehabilitating offenders. This Paper, if it did nothing morethan stimulate informed discussion of the intractable problems that haveto be solved, would have served a useful purpose. But it is hoped that itmay also serve, in some measure, as a chart by which we can plot our course in administering our penal institutions in the difficult years that lie immediately ahead of us.&apos;degree of intelligence and human understanding with a capacity to maintainstrict discipline without impairing the personal relationship with the prisonerwhich is the basis of all training.102. Secondly, the Prison Service as a whole, from the Commissionersat the centre to each member of the staff in every establishment, must work together as a team inspired by a common purpose which every officer clearlyUnderstands and in the achievement of which he has a real concern.103. Thirdly, the staff, wherever they serve, must be provided with thebuildings, amenides, equipment and training which are necessary to enablethem to carry out their difficult task efficiently and with a feeling of personalsatisfaction in their work.
