Subject to the Cabinet, this hasbeen approved on behalf of the Home Affairs Committee by a smallSub-Committee under my chairmanship.2.

DRAFT WHITE PAPEREMERGENCY LEGISLATIONIntroduction1.     Since it came to power the Government has been steadily-reducing the considerable amount of emergency legislationleft over since the Second World War.     The Government feels that a further major step forward is now possible:    this isto be talcen by the introduction of the Emergency Laws (Repeal)Bill.     Since 1939 new problems of government have arisen sothat powers first taken to deal with emergency conditions have become indispensable if those services which modernsociety demands are to be carried on.     However, the legislativestructure on which these pov/ers depend designed for emergencyconditions is no longer tolerable.2.     The Bill itself is not a long one but it deals with acomplicated body of legislation.     The first part of this white Paper consists of a general explanation cf what isproposed:    the second part explains the details, withparticular reference to the individual Acts of Parliament,the Defence Regulations and the Orders made under them.Part I3*     3y far the greater part of the functions exercised under emergency legislation has been authorised &quot;by defence regulations.      The present Government inherited 215 when it came to power in November, 1951o     There are now 13* with theaddition of 25 ancillary Regulations whose purpose is toenable the Regulations of substance to be enforced.     Apartfrom Defence Regulations, there are still in existence thefour emergency Acts and the amendment of the Ministry of SupplyAct mentioned in paragraph 6.
Defence (General) Regulations55	which gives general power to control	industry for wide purposes55AA	which empowers the Government to	secure the necessary information for the	same purposes55AB	which gives power to impose price control	of goods and services.Defence (Finance) Retaliation	2A which enables the Government to imposecertain exchange controls additional tothose included in the Exchange ControlAct, 1947.Defence (Armed Forces) Regulation6 which gives authority for the employmentof members of the armed forces on agricultural or other urgent work *fnational importance.5*     Some important functions are still exercised under these regulations - for example, control of the price of milk, ofthe distribution and price ef welfare foods, and of hire purchase and some powers are available for use if required,such as the power to secure information about and to controlprices of medical supplies required for the purposes of theNational Health Service.     These are very restrictedcompared v/ith the sweeping powers which were formerly, andIj..     Before considering the new legislation now proposed theGovernment had already decided to dispense with eight of thethirteen Defence Regulations of substance which still remain.These are either to lapse or to be replaced by permanent legislation.     This will leave the following five in existenc
are still potentially, conferred by Regulations 55, 55AA and55AB.     It may be possible in time to give some of them up,but others are now accepted as a permanent part of thefunctions of Government,     The Government&apos;s final aim is topass permanent legislation covering those powers which itproves necessary to retain, but, this would mean theintroduction of several Bills, some of them substantial andcomplicated:    it cannot be done in a single Session,     On theother hand, the Government regards it as undesirable inprinciple that these functions should be exercised under emergency legislation and that Regulations should remain in being which could be used as a means of introducing far-reaching economic controls without seeking legislation forthat purpose.6.     The Government therefore proposes to sweep away theemergency legislation (the Supplies and Services and emergency Laws Acts) which provides the authority for theDefence Regulations;    to provide fresh legislative authorityfor the powers still required, and to limit those powersstrictly.
Four functions only will be exercisable under Regulation 55:the imposition of certain strategic controls,control of hire-purchase,control of welfare &quot;foods,control of essential goods from overseas if the supply-should be interrupted.In addition, the authorisation of tho sale of bread in1h oz. and 28 oz. loaves and of school milk in one-third pintbottles will be retained.    The powers of price controlexercisable under Regulation 55AB will be applicable only tocommodities controlled under Regulation 55 (where thisis applicable),liquid milk,medical supplies.The powers exercisable under Regulation 55AA will be limitedtothose necessary to enforce the remaining powers under regulations 55 and 55AB,the furnishing, if necessary, of information essentialto the administration of the National Health Service.The additional powers available to several Ministers underthe amended Ministry of Supply Act will be severelyrestricted.    In particular, the trading powers will be abandoned, except for the power to trade in jute and jutegoods.    The power to control transfers of ships under theShips and Aircraft (Transfer Restriction) Act, 1939, will bereduced so that it may be exercised only for purposes ofdefence.    One section of the Government and Other Stocks Act,1939, will be kept permanently in effect, the other beingrepealed (see paragraph 22 (c) below).   Defence (Finance)Regulation 2A and Defence (Armed Forces) Regulation 6 and theImport, Export, and Customs Powers (Defence) Act, 1939. willbe retained for the time being.-u-
1,     The life of the Bill is to extend only to 31st December,-\96k*   Before that date such of the remaining powersexercised under Defence Regulations as prove permanentlynecessary can he embodied in permanent legislation and theremainder allowed to lapse.   Within the same period theremaining emergency legislation should he repealed, orreplaced.8.     The Bill itself does not complete the process of reducing or revoking emergency powers, though the powersstill exercised are few.   What it does is to estahlish that powers should not exist in peacetime, unspecified as totheir scope and purpose, which a Government might use at its discretion v/ithout the explicit authority of Farliament,It represents an affirmation of the principle that parliament should he asked to grant only specific powers for specific purposes.SSSCRET
Part this Part of the White Paper explains(i)    the existing legislation and the regulations in force under it (paragraphs 10-16);(ii)    the powers to be abolished, replaced, or allowed to expire (paragraph 1 7);(iii)    the powers remaining in force (paragraph 18);(iv)    the details of the action which the government proposes to take (paragraphs 19-27);(v)    the Bill (paragraphs 28-34);(vi)    the preliminary action necessary to prevent thepowers from lapsing while the Bill is beingconsidered by Parliament (paragraphs 35-37).5ECRET
The Existing Legislation and the Remilations in Force Under it10.    There are, in the first place, a number of defence regulations and Orders made under them which are still inforce.   The power to make Defence Regulations hy Order inCouncil was originally given hy the Emergency Powers (Defence)Act, 1939.    After the War two separate Acts were passed toenable certain of the Defpnce Regulations to he kept in forcenotwithstanding the expiry of the Emergency Powers (Defence)Act.   The Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act,19I4.5, (subsequently amended hy Acts of 19U7 and 1951) dealtwith those relating to economic   matters and the EmergencyLav/s (Transitional Provisions) Act, 19M-6, (subsequentlyamended hy the Emergency Lav/s (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act,19U7) with the rest,11.   The following are the substantive Defence Regulationsstill kept in force by the Supplies and Services Acts.The Defence (General) Regulations. 1939Number Subject matter+6 Control of Trade hy Sea.50 Power to do work on land.51 Taking possession of land.51A       Power to work minerals.55 General Control of industry.55AA     Powers of competent authorities as to keeping ofhooks, etc.55AB     Price control of goods and services.58AA     Avoidance of strikes and lockouts.59 Exemption from Acts relating to factories, mines and quarries.62 Control of cultivation and termination ofagricultural tenancies.-7-
The Defence (Finance) Regulations. 19592A        Power to impose certain exchange controls ontransactions with any country or territory.12.    The substantive Defence Regulations which are still kept in force by the Emergency Laws (Transitional Provisions) Act,19^6, and the Emergency Laws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act,19*4-7, are:-The Defence (General) Reprulations. 1959Number Subject Matter52 Use of land for purposes of K.M. Forces.The Defence (Armed Forces) Regulations, 19391 Title.6 Employment of members of the armed forces on agricultural work or other urgent work ofnational importance.13.    In addition, certain Defence Regulations remain in beingwhich are ancillary to the above and exist for the purpose of enforcing them.    These are set out in Appendix A.1U.   Secondly, section 6 of the Supplies and Services(Transitional Powers) Act, -\9h5, amends certain of the powersof the Minister of Supply, some of which are also exercisableby other Ministers.15.   All the powers mentioned above will come to an end on10th December, 1958,   unless they are continued in force &quot;byOrders in Council made in pursuance of Addresses toHer Majesty by both Houses of Parliament.    The government proposes to ask Parliament to keep them in force temporarily,pending the enactment of the Bill.16.    Thirdly, there are a number of Acts of Parliament, whichwill be terminated individually when an Order in Council ismade declaring at an end the state of emergency which led tothe passing of that particular Act.
These are the:-Governraent ana other Stocks (Emergency Provisions) .Act, 1939.Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence Act, 1939*Ships and Aircraft (Transfer Restriction). Act, 1939.Emergency Powers to he abolished, replaced or allowed to expire17.   Of the thirteen substantive Defence Regulations stillremaining (set out in paragraphs 11 and 12)  the government proposes to retain only five hy the Bill.     Of the other eight,four (Regulations 50, 51, 51A and 52) are replaced hy the LandPowers (Defence) Act, 1958, and the Opencast Coal Act, 1958,(the ancillary Regulations k10 and 85 being also no longer needed).A fifth - 59 - will be replaced by provisions, in a factories bill, to be introduced in the present Session.     A further three-2+6 (under which certain controls are exercised over the carriage of goods by sea to China and North Korea), 58AA (under which theIndustrial Disputes Tribunal was set up and on whose continuanceit depends) and 62 (control of cultivation and termination ofagricultural tenancies - will lapse without replacement.Powers remaining in force18.   The reductions and replacements indicated in the two previous paragraphs will leave onlyfive substantial Defence Regulations(Defence (General) Regulations 55. 55AA, 53ABDefence (Finance) Regulation 2ADefence (Armed Forces) Regulation 6)the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act, 1939the Ships and Aircraft (Transfer Restriction) Act, 1939the Government and other Stocks (Emergency Provisions) Act. 1939the amendment of the Ministry of Supply Act (paragraph 14)The Action which the Government proposes to take19.   The powers which can potentially be exercised under DefeaceRegulations 55* 55AA and 55AB are very wide.    For exampleRegulation 55 empowers a competent authority.-9-
&quot;to provide for regulating or prohibiting the production,treatment, keeping, storage movement, transport,distribution, disposal, acquisition, use or consumption ofarticles of any description&quot; and &quot;for any incidental and supplementary matters for which the competent authoritythinks it expedient for the purposes of the order toprovide&quot;.Regulation 55AB empowers a competent authority to:-&quot;provide for controlling the prices to be charged for goods of any description or the charges to be made for services of any description, and for any incidental orsupplementary matters for which the competent authoritythinks it necessary to provide&quot;.Regulation 55AA empowers a competent authority to require the keeping of such books, accounts and records and to furnish such estimates, returns or information as it may prescribe.     Untilthe passing in November, A95h of the Defence Regulations (No* 9)Order, these powers were, broadly speaking, unrestricted:though Regulations 55 and 55AA had to be used for the purposes specified in the Supplies and Services Acts of 19^+5, 19h7 and1951. those purposes are themselves extremely wide.Paragraph 1(1)(o) of the Act of 19k7 sums up the economicpurposes by specifying that the Regulations may be used:-&quot;generally for ensuring that the whole resources of thecommunity are available for use, and are used, in a manner best calculated to serve the interests of thecommunity&quot;while   the Supplies and Services (Defence Purposes) Act of 1951specifies that they may be used for the purposes of:-&quot;providing or securing supplies and services required forthe defence of any part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions or any territory under His Majesty&apos;s protection or in which hehas jurisdiction, or for the maintenance or restoration ofpeace and security in any part of the world, or for any measures arising out of a breach or apprehended breach ofpeace in any part of the world&quot;and for preventing supplies or services being disposed of ina manner prejudicial to these objects.-1 0-
20.   /The Order in Council of November 1954 cuts down theapplication of these Defence Regulations to a limited numberof specified purposes.     So long, however, as Section 3 of theSupplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945, which gives power to vary Regulations kept in force &quot;by that Act,remains in force, it is always possible to add to this limited number of specified purposes and so extend the Regulation tocover articles to which it does not at present apply.     Thus,Section 3 was used to give power to control hire purchase andhiring (under S.I. 295 of 1955 and S.I. 178 of 1956) and tocontrol oil and oil products when supplies from the Middle Eastwere interrupted in 1956 (S. I. Nos. 1693 and 1885 of 1956).(The power to vary Regulations can, of course, be exercisedonly for the purposes of the Supplies and Services Acts.^21.    By contrast with these very wide powers those which theGovernment actually requires; to retain are very limited.(a) In recent months the following have been abolished(i) allocation and price sontrol of domestic coal;(ii) control over the distribution and price of ironand steel scrap;(iii) controls exercised under Defence Regulations overa number of foods and agricultural commodities(cattle, sheep, pigs, eggs, &quot;bacon, flour, potatoes,&quot;bread, milk)\which have either &quot;been replaced bypowers taken under permanent legislation orabandoned.(b) The following are to be retained(i) control over the price of milk (55AB);(ii) control over the distribution and price of foodsdistributed under the welfare foods services(55 and 55AB);(lii) authority for the sale of bread in 14 and 28 ounceloaves and school milk in.jr pint bottles (55);
(iv) power to require information about and to control the prices of medical supplies required for theNational Health Service (55AA and 55AB);(v) power in appropriate cases to require information which will facilitate the determination of fairremuneration under that Service (55AA);(vi) control of the amount of credit which may be offered under hire-pur chase and similar agreements(55);(vii) certain strategic controls (maintained inconsultation with other countries) overmerchanting transactions, the re-export of goods and the construction of ships (55) (in addition tothe control of exports and imports which may beexercised under the Import, Export and CustomsPowers (Defence Act));(viii) the power (which it has exercised through the powerto vary existing Regulations) to control theproduction, distribution and price of any sommodityof supplies from overseas, on which we depend,should be interrupted.      (55 and 55AB).22.   The other two Defence Regulations are limited in their application.       Defence (Finance) Regulation 2A empowers theTreasury, in certain circumstances, to control transactionsbetween residents in the Sterling Area, whioh are outside thereach of the Exchange Control Act, and also provides means whichare not avilahle under the Act of controlling transactions ingold and Treasury Bills held to the United Kingdom for residentsoutside the United Kingdom.     Defence    (Armed Forces)Regulation 6 provides the power to employ troops if necessary on agricultural or other urgent work of national importance.Both these powers must be retained.23.   Of the Acts referred to in paragraph 18
The Import. Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act, 19399confers the powers under which the whole of theGovernment&apos;c control ovor imports and exports of goodsis now exercised.     It was introduced for defence purposes though it contains no restrictions as to thepurpose for which these controls may he exercised.Although our import policy has been progressivelyliberalised and many of the controls on our exports have been removed, it would be unrealistic to suppose that all control over either could be- dispensed within the near future.The Ships and Aircraft (Transfer Restriction) Act. 1939?is now limited to ships, the provisions relating to aircraft having been repealed in 19U7.     Under the act the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation has un-restricted power to prevent the transfer or mortgage ofBritish ships other than those registered in an independent commonwealth country.     The Act is at present used only tocontrol certain transfers of strategic types of ship.The Government propose to retain the powers under the Actbut to limit their use to purposes of defence.The Government considers that one of the powers given &quot;bythe Government and other Stocks (Emergency Provisions) Act(that which enables transfers of such stocks to be madeby instrument in writing) is still needed in respect of afew stocks, though permanent legislation has been passedenabling most issues to be dealt with in this way.(The power to extend, the  time-limit for the payment ofcoupons will be abandoned).
24.   Under the Ministry of Supply Act. 1939. the minister may buy, sell and manufacture any articles required by government Departments for the discharge of their functions and also articles which are, in his opinion, essential tothe needs of the country in the event of war.     S*6 of theSupplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945 enabled the powers of purchase,  sale and manufacture to be used forwide economic purposes and purposes of reconstruction.These powers are also exercisable by other Ministers.      Ofthese powers, by far the most important is the power to buy,sell and manufacture for the purpose of securing -&quot;a sufficiency of those /supplies/7 essential to thewellbeing of the community or their equitable distribution or their availability at fair prices. 11These powers, which enable Ministers to buy, sell and manufacture on public account, are complementary to thepowers,  (specified in paragraph 13) under Defence Regulations 55*55AA and 55AB which enable Ministers to control, for the samepurposes the private purchase, sale and manufacture of the sameclasses of articles.25.     The Government proposes to dispense with the powers atpresent available to Ministers for these wide economic purposes and to replace them by powers restricted to the purposes forwhich the powers are currently required by the Minister ofSupply and Board of Trade, modifying and adapting those powerswhere necessary to meet present conditions.26.     The Supplies and Services (Defence Purposes) Act, 1951iy adding to the 1945 Act the purposes of defence of theCommonwealth and the maintenance of world peace enabled theMinister to supply defence material for overseas Governments.It is proposed to retain these powers, which are now are recognised part of the Minister1s defence supply functions.-14-SECRET
27.   The limited objects for which the powers conferred by the&quot;1945 Act will in future be exercisable are as follows -(1)    by the Minister of Supply -(a) to supply defence materials and to undertakedefence experimental or research work forforeign governments and international organisations;(b) to dispose of surplus stores on behalf ofother Departments or other Governments;(c) to supply civil goods if requested to do so bya producer of the goods to be supplied,provided that the work can be done withoutexpanding the capacity of the Royal OrdnanceFactories or other of the Ministers&apos;establishments;(d) to undertake civil experimental or research work, provided it has been requested by aGovernment Department, a research organisation,er by industry and is within the capacity of theMinisters establishments undertaking experimentalor research work.(2)    by the Board of Trade to trade in jute and jute goods.S.6 made other lesser amendments of the Ministry of SupplyAct 1939, including an extension of the duration of certaincompulsorjr powers to enforce the production of supplies.      Itis proposed to allow all these compulsory powers to lapseexcept for that which enables the Minister to direct theproduction of documents and records necessary to determine fairprices for the goods which he has to purchase.     The remainingamendments will continue in force.
The Bill28.   The Bill consists of ten Clauses, and four Schedules:many of the provisions relating to the amendment of theRegulations which are to continue in force are included inthe First Schedule.     The following are the main ones.29,   Clause 1 repeals the substance of the Supplies and services Acts and the Emergency Laws Acts and provides that subject to the provisions of the Bill the Regulations madeunder them shall cease to have effect.30.    Clause 2(i)    specifies the Regulations (i.e. the five substantiveones referred to in paragraph 18 together with the ancillary Regulations) which are to continue ineffect by virtue of the Act itself;(ii)    provides that the powers exercisable under regulations 55, 55AA and 55AB shall be limited tothose set out in paragraph 21  (b) above.      (Thenecessary amendments to the Regulations and the amended form in which the Regulations will haveeffect are shown in the First and Second Schedules.)The power to vary existing Regulations by Order inCouncil (referred to in paragraph 20 above) is todisappear with the repeal of the Supplies and services (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945, but theBill itself amends the appropriate Regulations insuch a way as to give the Government power tocontrol the distribution and price of any commodityin the event of a serious interruption of essential supplies from overseas (paragraph 21  (viii) above).The Bill stipulates that this particular power mayonly be exercised following an affirmative resolution of each House of Parliament;
(iii)    provides that the current orders and directionsmade under the Regulations which are to remain ineffect shall continue in force whether or not theycould have been made under the powers as amended bythe Bill.     The Bill prohibits, however, anyvariation, otherwise than, by revocation in whole orin part, of any provision of any of these orders which could not be included in an order made underthe amended powers.     The orders in question arelisted in Appendix B to this Paper.31.    Clause 3 continues the powers of the Minister of Supplyand Board of Trade which are needed for the purposes set outin paragraph 27 but in a reduced and restricted form.32.    Clause h limits the life of the Ships and Aircraft(Transfer Restriction) Act, 1939, and provides that a sanctionunder the Act is not to be refused except for purposes ofdefence.33.    Clause 6 continues permanently in effect the clause inthe Government and other Stocks (Emergency Provisions) Act,1939which suspends the transfer of stocks by inscription in the books of registrars and makes provision for all transfers tobe by instrument in writing.3km Clause 10 specifies that the powers renewed by the Act(other than that mentioned in paragraph 33) shall expire on31st December, 1964.
Preliminary Action35&apos;    Since the Defence Regulations listed in paragraphs 11and 12 above and the Acts under which they are now kept inforce will come to an end on 10th December, 1958, unless theyare continued in force by Orders in Council made in pursuanceof Addresses to Her Majesty by both Houses of Parliament, itwill be necessary to present Motions for such Addresses inorder to keep the Regulations in force while the Bill whichis to determine their future is under discussion.     Two Motionswill be necessary which will be placed on the Order Papers ofboth Houses;    one under s.8(1) of the Supplies and Services(Transitional Powers) Act, 1945 &quot;to continue that Act in force for a further year, which will automatically result in thecontinuance of those Defence Regulations at present continued by that Act;    the other under s.7 of the Emergency Laws(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1947 to continue in force fora further year Regulations 1 and 6 of the Defence (Armed Forces)Regulations.     Defence (General) Regulation 52 and the ancillary Regulations at present continued in force by virtueof the 1947 Act will not be continued by the new order under that Act, though the ancillary Regulations will remain in force under the 1945 Act.36.    Section 3(1) of the Emergency Laws (Transitional Provisions)Act, 1946, as amended by s.4 of the Emergency Laws (miscellaneous provisions) Act, 1947, will not be continued by the new order and as a result certain provisions in Part III of the agriculture (Miscellaneous War Provisions) Act, 1940, relatingto dams and sluices will cease to be exercisable.37.   The Regulations revoked by the Land Powers (Defence) Act,1958, (assuming that their continuance after 10th December is
authorised by Order in Council) will cease to have effect on31st December, 1958.     The remaining Regulations which canbe dispensed with v/ill lapse if the proposed Bill should become lav/, since no provision for their continuance is madein it.     The dates by v/hich the individual Regulations shouldlapse under legislation/either enacted or proposed aretherefore -10 December, 1958. 5231 December, 1958. 50, 51, 51A, 85.When the proposed 46, 49, 58AA, 62.Bill becomes law.Defence (Finance)Regulations 8 and ?B.When the factories bill becomes law.59.     Clause 5 of thepresent Bill keeps this regulation in force forthe meantime.C.1327-58
