(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HEP BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)...... ..      -^C. (58) 254 COPY NO. (lQ17th December, 1958CABINETINT EP. NATIONAL WHALING CONVENTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food the greater part of the world whale catch is taken by the floatingfactory fleets operating in the Antarcti c.   There are twenty fleets underthe flags of Norway (nine), Japan.(six), United Kingdom (three),Netherlands (one)and the U. S. S. H. (one).   The annual catch is limitedfor conservation purposes under the International Whaling Convention towhich the Governments of all five countries (and twelve others) are party.The catch ceiling is reviewed annually and is at present 15, 000 &quot;bluewhale units&quot; (a common denominator for whales of different species inrelation to their yield of oil).2.      The general scientific opinion is that this ceiling is too high tosafeguard the future of the whale stocks.   The existing fleets, however,are facing a worsening economic prospect.   Apart from falling whale oilprices, the Soviet Union is building new factory fleets which will reducethe catch of everyone else.   The fleets of Norway, the United Kingdom andit is believed Japan are without State assistance - the Norwegians utilisethe whale least fully, the British get a better product yield, while theJapanese not only have cheap labour costs but use the meat for human consumption and get the best overall return from the whale.   The Dutchfleet is ensured of a return on capital by the State until 1961.3.      In these circumstances Her Majesty&apos;s Government called aConference of the five countries in London last month to discuss fleetlimitation and the sharing of the annual catch authorised under theInternational Whaling Convention.   Such arrangements must be outside theConvention, which allows only of a &quot;free-for-all&quot; until the authorisedcatch is reached.4.      Agreement was reached at the London Conference on these recommendations to Governments;-(a) a scheme of fleet limitation under which the Soviet Union would add no more than three new fleets, while the total numberoperated by the other four countries would not be increased;(b) a quota scheme under which the Soviet Union would have20 per cent of the annual catch authorised under the Convention,with the remaining 80 per cent divided between the other four countries in proportions to be agreed by 1st June, 1959;-1-:
(c) both, schemes to operate for a seven-year period beginning withthe 1959/60 Antarctic season (when the first and perhaps thesecond of the new Soviet fleets is expected to appear);(d) these agreements to be void if newcomers should engage inAntarctic whaling under the Convention.All delegations signed the full text of the recommendations except theTapanese, who were without the necessary instructions but neverthelessagreed to make the recommendations to their Government.   The japanese have still to sign but are thought likely to do so.5.       The purpose in requiring the quota agreement to be completed by 1st Tune, 1959, is this.   The Convention permits any Government to give notice of withdrawal by 1st Tanuary in any year.   The notice tak.es effect at 30th Tune following and may meantime be rescinded.   So any of theGovernments would be able to give notice this month and rescind it before 30th Tune next if the quota negotiations should by then have been successfully concluded.6.      The questions for decision are therefore;-(a) whether to approve the London Conference recommendations(paragraph 4);(b) whether to give notice of withdrawal from the InternationalWhaling Convention by 1st Tanuary.7.      As to paragraph 6(a), Soviet acceptance of a maximum 20 per cent of the authorised catch for four fleets for seven years (last season theyaccounted for 10 per cent with a single fleet) is not at all a bad bar gain.The fleet limitation and quota agreements could be operated withoutinfringing the International Whaling Convention.   The arrangements appearlikely to be acceptable to the other countries subject to a satisfactoryallocation of the remaining 80 per cent of the authorised catch.   TheUnited Kingdom whaling industry would welcome fleet limitation and asatisfactory quota arrangement.   We recommend, therefore, that theLondon Conference recommendations should be approved.8.      As to paragraph 6(b), notice of withdrawal would have two objects;-(i)     the tactical purpose ofi exercising pressure upon the other partiesto conclude the quota agreement;  and(ii)     the precautionary aim of protecting the position of the Britishwhaling industry if the quota agreement should not be concluded.9.      The United Kingdom whaling industry are urging ^hat notice of withdrawl be given with both purposes in view.   They believe that a quota agreement will not otherwise be concluded but are more concernedwith protecting their position if no such agreement is made.   In that event, they would rather operate outside the Convention than within it.If there is no quota agreement, and the United Kingdom remains a partyto the Convention, the industry would expect to be faced with uneconomic-2-
operating conditions in the 1959/60 season and thereafter because theSoviet Union would then be free of the proposed 20 per cent limit.   We are told that one of the three United Kingdom fleets might be withdrawn -with consequent seasonal unemployment of over 200 whaling crew fromScottish black spots.10.    As to paragraph 8(i), we are all agreed that there are noconvincing grounds for concluding that notice of withdrawal would make all the other parties more ready to agree upon quotas in order to avoidunregulated whaling.   In particular, the Japanese, being the lowest-costproducers, might think that others would first go to the wall;  while theNetherlands Government is advised by its scientists that-the whale stocks are not in danger a.nd would be likely to calculate that a period ofunregulated whaling would save the State money without ruining the whalefishery.   The Russians are the best placed of all to face unregulatedwhaling.   They might well consider themselves no longer bound to the20 per cent share if any of the other four countries gave notice of with-drawal from the Convention.   They would also derive great propagandavalue from the inability of the capitalist countries to agree among them-selves.11.     As to paragraph 8(ii), the industry have a case for precautionarynotice of withdrawal.   This would safeguard them against the risk theywould otherwise face in 1959/60.   But the precautionary notice mightfall to be carried through and the chances of agreement with the soviet union would then be lost.   Supposing, however, notice of withdrawal werenot given, and the quota agreement was not concluded by 1st June next,the Rus russians might still be willing to keep to the 20 per cent figure forthe 1959/60 season while another attempt was made.   We could then consider giving notice a year from now if we had failed in the one thingand the other;  and we might consider assuring the industry that in those circumstances we should in fact give notice a year from now.   They wouldthen be at risk solely for the 1959/60 season and the withdrawal of any oftheir three fleets might thereby be averted.12.    Notice of withdrawal also involves wider considerations.   TheUnited Kingdom has always been a leader in the making of fisheryconservation agreements.   Effective conservation has been one of ourchief defences against extensions of fishery limits.   We have signed the fishing and Conservation Convention adopted at the Geneva Conferenceon the Law of the Sea.   Any seeming departure from our policies inthese respects would be prejudicial to the work of building up a majorityfor the second Geneva Conference on which we are about to embark withthe Americans.   We would not escape damage to our general position ifwe should be the first of the Antarctic whaling countries to give notice,even if it were only precautionary.13.    We are all of the opinion that m. ch weight should be given to thesewider considerations.   We differ somewhat in our overall assessment of thebalance of advantage in the matter of giving notice of withdrawal.   TheMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food ision the whole of the view thatit would be inadvisable for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to take the initiative in giving notice this year.   The Secretary of State for Scotland feels thatif the reasons for giving notice were properly presented the arguments inparagraph 12 could be largely discounted, and that in view of the uncertainties of the future the industry can reasonably expect to be insuredagainst the immediate consequences of failure to reach agreement;accordiigly he feels on balance that the right course is to give notice of withdrawl.
14.    In submitting this issue to our colleages we would add that norway and/or the Netherlands may themselves give notice of withdrawal.Under the International Whaling Convention the United Kingdom wouldthen have a further month in which to decide whether to follow suit ornot.   We are agreed on making a further submission to our colleagues in that event.J. M.J. H.17th December, 1958-4-
