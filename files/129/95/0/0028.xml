secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1958C. (58) 228 ,     Copy No.4th November, 1958CABINETKUWAIT : INTERNATIONAL relations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsBy the Exclusive Agreement of 23rd January, 1899, the Shaikh of Kuwait boundhimself and his successors &quot; not to receive the Agent or Representative of any power or Government.... without the previous sanction of the British Government.&quot; he also undertook not to alienate territory without the British Governments consent.On 3rd November, 1914, the Ruler of Kuwait was informed &quot; that the BritishGovernment does recognise and admit that the Shaikhdom of Kuwait is anindependent government under British protection.&quot;2. In practice, with certain exceptions, the Ruler conducts his foreign relationsthrough Her Majesty&apos;s Government. In international law Kuwait has been regardedhitherto as a state for whose international relations Her Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom are responsible.3. Even before the Iraqi revolution of 14th July, 1958, the Ruler of Kuwaitshowed signs of restiveness in this position of apparent tutelage. Since that date hehas warned us with increasing frequency and force that if the essentials of hisrelationship with Her Majesty&apos;s Government are to be preserved the BritishGovernment must be prepared to allow to Kuwait the greatest possible appearance of independence. He is under considerable pressure in this respect not only fromhis own family, but also from many of the groups on whose support the strength ofthe regime in Kuwait must largely rest.4. On 31st July, 1958, the Ruler informed the Political Agent that he had been considering the possibility of joining the Arab League, as evidence both of hisindependence and of kuwait&apos;s solidarity with the Arab world. I considered thisproposal carefully and the Political Resident, on my instructions, explained to the ruler on 17th August the objections to this proposal. The Ruler readily recognisedthese objections, but asked whether the British Government could give him anyfurther written undertaking that they would continue to protect him: he was particularly concerned with assurance of protection against Iraq. The draft of sucha Letter of Assurance, which had been approved by the Prime Minister, was subsequently discussed with the Ruler, and the text of the substantive part of theLetter handed to the Ruler on 23rd October is annexed to this paper (Annex A).5. On 30th September, during discussion of the draft of the Letter, the Rulerclarified his position in a memorandum, the text of which is also annexed to this paper (Annex B).6. The immediate purpose of this paper is to discuss one point arising fromthe Ruler&apos;s memorandum, the question of the form in which Kuwait shall adhere tocertain Maritime Conventions (International Safety and Load Line Conventions),and also to the International Telecommunications Union (I.T.U.). A decision-onthis is urgent. The first ocean-going Kuwaiti-owned ship is due for delivery inMarch or April 1959, and the Ruler intends that these ships shall be operated under54274
the Kuwaiti flag. A simplified Maritime Code for Kuwait is being drafted by theMinistry of Transport and Civil Aviation who are now discussing the draft withKuwaiti representatives. The form of drafting depends on whether Kuwait is to accede to the Maritime Conventions as an independent state or whether the conventions should be extended to Kuwait by the United Kingdom as to a&quot; protected state.&quot;7. The Ruler&apos;s memorandum does not categorically state that only accessionas an independent state would be acceptable. It speaks only of &quot; membership,&quot;&quot; participation,&quot; and of &quot; participating actively in &quot; and &quot; acceding to &quot; certainConventions. There is however no doubt that the Ruler, and still ^more some ofhis family and his supporters, are thinking of independent membership of these organisations. Associate membership of the I.T.U., which could be achieved through nomination by the British Government, would not confer the rights of full membership and would tend to emphasise the dependent status of Kuwait.The same is true of accession to the Maritime Conventions, although the Rulerhas not expressed in relation to these the same decided wish as he has for theI.T.U. Even if the Ruler could be persuaded to rest content for the moment with less than full membership of the Conventions in question, there is no doubt thatpopular feeling in Kuwait would shortly compel him to press for the privilegesof full membership.8. In the last resort Her Majesty&apos;s Government are unable to resist a determined demand from the Ruler for concessions of this nature; and indeed it would be impolitic to try to do so. All that can be done is to represent to him the difficulties and dangers. This has already been done in the case of the Ruler&apos;suggestion that he might join the Arab League, with the result that he has droppedthe proposal at least for the present. It has also been done once, last June, inrespect of the Rulers&apos; wish for full membership of the I.T.U., but in the memorandumat Annex B the Ruler has revived the question.9. We must therefore assume that the Ruler has fully weighed the dangers which have been outlined to him and which can be summarised as follows. Ifthe British Government put forward Kuwait&apos;s application for full membership of these Conventions, and if they are challenged in consequence, they would have tosay that they regarded Kuwait as &quot; fully responsible for the conduct of its international relations.&quot; In itself this statement would do little more than confirm the present state of affairs, since Her Majesty&apos;s Governments position resemblesthat of agent much more than that of a controller of Kuwait&apos;s foreign relations.The public assertion of this principle would however be a landmark in our relationswith the Persian Gulf States. In Kuwait such a declaration might make it moredifficult for the Ruler and Her Majesty&apos;s Government to resist attempts by theUnited Arab Republic and other States to gain a foothold. The Ruler wouldbe more exposed to direct approaches from many quarters, nearly all of whichwould be designed to weaken our own position in the Gulf or which, at least, wouldhave the effect of weakening it. The best defence by the Ruler would be that although he was responsible for the conduct of his own foreign relations he continued to choose to conduct them through us. In any event it might benecessary for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to make the point themselves from timeto time. In any case, however, it would become clear that the relationship betweenKuwait and the United Kingdom was terminable at the will of the Ruler, andalthough this is in fact already true, a public acknowledgment of it might wellprovoke a demand for similar declarations in respect of Qatar and probably alsoBahrain.10. On the other hand we could hope to gain, at the best, only a few months&apos;time by continuing to press the Ruler to be content with less than full membership of the organisation in question. Meanwhile we should risk forfeiting the goodwill achieved by the Letter of Assurance given to the Ruler on 23rd October, andwe should certainly arouse suspicions of our motives. For technical reasons also,accession by Kuwait to the Maritime Conventions under our aegis would probablyentail friction between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and Kuwait, since it would bethe responsibility of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to call Kuwait to order for theprobably inevitable Kuwaiti infractions of their maritime obligations.11. I invite my colleagues to agree, therefore, that the Political Agent shouldbe instructed to lay before the Ruler once more the consequences which may arise
from a decision to seek full membership for Kuwait under the MaritimeConventions, and consequentially also in the International TelecommunicationsUnion, and to inform the Ruler that if he is willing nevertheless to accept these risk Her Majesty&apos;s Government will take the steps necessary to secure membershipfor Kuwait as an independent State.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W.1,3rd November, 1958.ANNEX a substantive Text of Letter of Assurance Given to the Ruler of Kuwait on23rd October, 1958.&quot; I am instructed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to convey the following assurance to Your Highness. Her Majesty&apos;s government do not wish for any change in their relationship with Kuwait. They continue tobe ready, as in the past, to provide any support which may be necessary inconnection with kuwait&apos;s relations with other countries. They understand thatit is Your Highness&apos;s intention to deal with certain matters affecting Kuwait&apos;relations with other Arab States by your own efforts to the extent that your highness considers this desirable in the interests of Kuwait. This would not ofcourse impair the relationship between Kuwait and Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentdescribed above.2. Her Majesty&apos;s Government wish at the same time to confirm your highness&apos; understanding that when matters affecting kuwait&apos;s interests arise between them and other Governments they will consult Your Highness and willnot enter into any commitment relating to such matters before consultation hastaken place.3. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced of the value to both kuwait and themselves of free and frank exchanges of views on international questions.Their representatives have been instructed to keep Your Highness generallyinformed of their views on such questions and they continue to value the views which Your Highness expresses in return.&quot;ANNEX 8Memorandum of 30th September, 1958, by the Kuwait GovernmentThe Secretariat,Govt. of Kuwait,P.O. Box 3.30th September, 1958.In accordance with Great Britain&apos;s Treaty with the late Sheikh Mubarak all foreign relations have been conducted through Her Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment. With the passing of time and the changes of circumstances it hasbecome clear that some questions in the foreign relations with Arab countries,as with Iraq, required the help of the Ruler to take an active, direct part in thesettlement of certain questions.2. By experience it was found that such direct contacts between Kuwait andthe other states on certain matters have become necessary because of changed circumstances.3. In essence the relations between His Highness the Ruler and Her BritannicMajesty&apos;s Government remained and will remain the same: the Ruler of kuwait and Her Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government are very good friends, they have mutualinterests, and they stand as allies and stick together under all circumstances.  It
would, however, be in the interest of these relations and friendship that neitherparty should adhere to formalities and the letter of the written word when flexibility in applying or interpreting the existing relations can help to keep the independence of Kuwait and to maintain her good relations with her Arab neighbours.4. The draft letter lays down certain procedures for the Ruler to adopt inHis dealings with the Arab states, and this provision, it is believed, will help bothKuwait and Great Britain as it leaves for Kuwait scope to participate to any possible extent in Arab relations in a direct manner. This assumption of Kuwait of someof the responsibilities towards the Arab world will certainly be welcpme in bothKuwait and the Arab states inasmuch as it is an indication to the Arabs that Kuwaitis prepared to take up her responsibilities in Arab affairs.5. The benefit that Kuwait will derive from such a step is that her Arabneighbours will not look upon Kuwait as a segregate unit in the Arab world, and theArabs will realise that Kuwait is a friendly Arab country, and no one would accordingly create difficulties for her.6. To create a friendly atmosphere in the Arab world for Kuwait it would help if the neighbours see that Kuwait is taking an active part expected of herin some of the international bodies which had been formed for the purpose oflooking after the various normal walks of life, such as posts, telephones,telecommunications, quarantine, marine, &amp;c.7. If it is possible therefore to arrive at an equation whereby the wishes ofcertain communities in Kuwait could be satisfied, for instance, Kuwait membership of such international bodies as the I.T.U., such participation would not only be welcome among the Arabs but would also definitely be in the interest of the ally,Great Britain, inasmuch as it would help to stabilise the regime in Kuwait.8. An evolution of the relations between Kuwait and Great Britain shouldbe no cause for fear and anxiety. In the past, for instance, the Government of Kuwait had not been responsible for many of the internal public facilities such aspost, telegraph, telephone, airport, quarantine, &amp;c.; now that Kuwait Governmentis responsible for the foregoing, it cannot be said that- this change has affected inprinciple the friendly relations between the Ruler and Her Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment.9. There is again now a desire to take further steps such as participation inthe I.T.U. and access to certain marine conventions, and there is no reason to believethat these steps would in any way impair the friendly relations that exist betweenthe two countries.10. Relations between various states are always governed by mutual interestslinking such states.11. Any two countries linked together through mutual interests would findeither coming to the help of the other without necessarily being bound by pact orprotection treaty. The United States, for instance, went to the help of the Lebanonwhen the interest of both governments called for such help; Great Britain helped the Jordanian Government for the same reason despite the fact that there had notbeen an agreement for protection or help and, on the contrary, that it was only recently that agreements between the two latter states had been abrogated.12. His Highness the Ruler wishes therefore that His relations with HerBritannic Majesty&apos;s Government should better be based on a certain amount of flexibility and the capability to readjust to changing circumstances, and suchrelations could be crystallised as follows:  13. In essence and principle there has not been and there shall not be anychange in the fact that both the Ruler and Her Britannic Majesty&apos;s Governmentare friends and allies in their mutual interests, neither party would wish to changethis basis. On the other hand and because of the phenomenon that circumstanceschange with the passing of time, His Highness the Ruler wishes that a formula befound whereby Kuwait could, when it is in her interest, participate actively in international bodies when such participation is desirable inasmuch as it satisfiesthe trends of thought among the Kuwaitis and it tinges Kuwait with a progressivecolour which suits the conditions prevalent in the Arab world.14. His Highness the Ruler wishes therefore that Sir Bernard Burrows, beforesigning and despatching the letter, should give deep thought to the question in thelight of the foregoing.
