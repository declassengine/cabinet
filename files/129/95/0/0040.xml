(TH^JbOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 240COPY NO. X22nd November, 1958CABINETSOCIAL INVESTMENT:   education memorandum by the Secretary of State for ScotlandWith his memorandum (C.(58) 239) the Minister of education has circulated a draft White Paper setting out his proposals for educational advance in England and Wales during the next five years.proposals for Scotland.   At one time we thought it might be desirable tohave a single White paper with separate sections for England and wales and for Scotland.   We found, however, that although the advances proposedin the two countries are based on the same principles the practical problems that have to be tackled differ in such a way that they can most conveniently be dealt with in separate documents.3.        There is only one material point of difference in presentationbetween the two drafts.   I have included in paragraph 17 of the Scottishdraft a reference to the decision, which the Minister of Labour isannouncing on 26th November, to grant indefinite deferment to all trainedteachers.   The Minister of Education has made no corresponding reference in his draft.   I trust that my colleagues will agree to the line I have taken on this in the Scottish Paper.   It is on staffing that our proposals can beleast precise and convincing, and inevitably it is on this aspect thatcriticisms of our educational policy will be concentrated.   I feel strongly that our proposals will carry more conviction if the decision to extenddeferment is presented as a major step in our efforts to tackle theproblem of increasing our teaching resources, a problem which isparticularly acute in Scotland.4.        The figure for capital expenditure in paragraph 21 is in accordancewith the agreement reached with the Treasury on the amount of capital investment available for education in Scotland from 1960/61 onwards.5.        I should be glad to have the approval of my colleagues to thepublication of the White Paper for Scotland along with that for England.2.I now circulate a similar draft White Paper with correspondingJ.M.Scottish Office, S.W.1.21st November, 1958

EDUCATION IN scotland the NEXT STEP1. Early in 1956 the Government announced their plans for the develment of technical education, which involved in Scotland a programmecapital expenditure amounting to  12m. over the next five years largely on theprovision by education authorities of new local technical colleges but also onextensions of the existing central institutions. Since then the Governmenthave also announced proposals for a considerable expansion of the universities.If the fullest benefit is to be derived from these measures, it is essential thatthe pupils leaving our secondary schools should be adequately equipped totake full advantage of the extended facilities. During the next few years theincrease in the number of pupils in our primary schools which has been a feature of recent years will fall off considerably, although rolls will againbegin to rise in the late &apos;60s. This easing off in numbers appears to theGovernment to provide a suitable occasion to review the position and to put inhand measures to stimulate further advance, particularly in secondary educa-tion. This Paper describes the measures that the Government propose to take in Scotland.PROGRESS SINCE THE WAR2. The principle first laid down in the 1945 Act that every child shouldreceive education in accordance with age, ability and aptitude has proved ofparticular importance for secondary education. All courses for pupils ofabout the age of 12 and over had indeed been organised as secondary coursessince 1939, but, so long as pupils could leave school at 14 and so long as many remained in the primary school well beyond the age of 12, the period of secondary education received by the great majority was so short as to depriveit of much of its value. The raising of the school leaving age to 15 in 1947,together with the acceptance of the principle that all pupils should be itrans-ferred from the primary to the secondary school by the age of 12\ at latest,ensured that many more pupils received at least three years of secondary education than the small minority who had done so in the past. Whereas in1947 less than a sixth of all pupils leaving school had completed at least threeyears of secondary education, in 1958 weir over a half did so, and in some areas where pupils had been transferred timeously the proportion exceededthree-quarters.3. Over the same period the number of pupils voluntarily remaining at school beyond the age of 15 has increased by nearly half. Within this group,the number of pupils of 17 years of age and over has risen from 5,250 in 1951to 7,319 in 1958, an increase of about 40 per cent. These increases arereflected in the number of candidates in the Scottish Leaving Certificateexamination, normally taken at the age of 17, which has risen from 10,286 in1951 to 14,009 in 1958, an increase of 36 per cent. Over the same period thenumber presented in a group of subjects broadly equivalent to that required for university enltrance increased by 14 per cent.4. In the field of further education the principal development has beenthe increase in the number of part-time day students released from employ-ment from 5,000 ito 31,000 over the last ten years, a rate of progress whichmust, however, be greatly exceeded in the years ahead. There has also beena notable rise from 2,000 to 5,000 in the number of students pursuing full-timepre-vocational courses, covering a variety of occupations, e.g. engineering,building and nursing.   At the more advanced levels of further education,
&apos; including the universities, the number of students in Scotland had always beenrelatively very high, and increases have been on a relatively more modest scale. Nevertheless, ithe total number of students in the central institutions andthe universities is now more than a third above the pre-war figure.flk 5. The advances in our schools described above have been achieved at a^Eme when rolls have been inflated as a result of the higher post-war birthrate and when numerous additional schools have had to be provided to serve the extensive new housing areas. These factors have given rise to heavy demands for new buildings and additional Staff. New school accommodationhas been provided amounting tto 288,000 places, corresponding to nearlyione-third of the whole school population. Although it has so far been necessary to defer the replacement of existing buildings which fall short of modern standards, the Government have been able to allow education autho-rities in Scotland to proceed without delay with every building projectrequired to meet the needs arising from higher school rolls and from new housing areas. Moreover, the school buildings of today, while planned more economically than a decade ago, are better designed for their purpose andafford pleasant working conditions which have proved stimulating to bothteachers and pupils.6. Since the war there has been a steady demand for additional teachersarising from the increased number of pupils, due first to the raising of theleaving age (which created a special demand for secondary teachers) andthen to the higher birth-rate since the war, and from the wider choice of subjects offered in secondary schools. The number of certificated teachers in public and grant-aided schools in Scotland has been raised from 28,500 in1947 to 35,000 in 1957, an increase of nearly a quarter. At the same timethe average number of pupils to each certificated teacher has fallen from26-0 to 243. In spite of the high standards of academic and professionaltraining long established in Scotland a university degree for men teachers andthree years of training for all non-graduate women teachers the numberof teachers is increasing year by year and continues to receive a usefulaugmentation through the Special Recruitment Scheme designed to attractrecruits from other walks of life. Nevertheless, many more teachers are needed in order to keep pace with rising secondary rolls, to staff the newtechnical colleges, and to effect such necessary improvements as reducingthe size of classes and replacing teachers who are not certificated or arepast retiring age.7. The advances made in our schools cannot be adequately measured interms of numbers alone. In the primary school, in spite of such adverseconditions as large classes and buildings that often fall short of modernstandards, there has been a welcome development in the use of progressivetechniques of teaching, including group and individual methods. Now thatthe secondary schools have for the first time to provide for all and not for a selected few, much has been done to foster a broader conception of secondary education which recognises the diversity of talents and needs and the physical and aesthetic as well as the intellectual aspects of personality. Such subjects as handwork, home craft, drama, art and music now have a much moreassured place in the school, and there has been a remarkable developmentof school societies and other activities that complement the work of theclassroom and make for a vigorous corporate life. Much attention andexperiment have been devoted to the special problems of junior secondary education, where considerable progress has been made in developing distinctiveaims and methods related to the needs of the pupils, both as young people with their own present interests and as the citizens, workers and parentsof the future.
.   THE TASKS AHEAD8. Looking ahead to what is still to be done, the Government have cometo the conclusion that, if every pupil is to be able to pursue to the limit ofhis capacity an education suited to his individual needs, the most urgentrequirement is to make available to all the widest possible range of second^fc*courses, adequately staffed by suitably qualified teachers and with building and equipment that satisfy modern standards. On the side of organisation,this does not call for a complete recasting of Scottish secondary educationbut rather for certain adjustments designed to ensure that the system is reallyfulfilling its accepted aims and, in particular, that it is properly co-co-ordinated with further education.The organisation of secondary education9. Secondary education ds required by the Act of 1946 to be appropriate to the age, ability and aptitude of the pupils and to the period for whichthey may be expected to remain at school. Accordingly, secondary schools,while aiming at providing a general education, include a wide range of coursesvaried in content to suit different needs. Courses differ also in duration:junior secondary courses, designed for pupils leaving school at 15, extendnormally to three years; and senior secondary courses, intended for pupilsremaining at school until 17 or 18, to five or six years. These two kinds of course are provided sometimes separately in junior secondary and insenior secondary schools, and sometimes together in schools organised on comprehensive lines. Comprehensive schools are no novelty in Scotland ;they have for long been the normal type in communities of moderate size and have also been provided in some more populous centres. But with the wide differences in geographical conditions and distribution of populationfound in Scotland, the precise pattern of educational organisation differs from area to area, and sometimes even within the same area, and it willcontinue to be the policy of the Government that each education authority should be free to adopt the form of organisation which it considers best suited to the particular needs of its area.Selection10. The allocation of pupils to secondary courses has generally been based on primary teachers&apos; scaled estimates of ability, together with, in mostareas, the results of intelligence and attainment tests, and with special consideration for any exceptional circumstances. Parents must be consulted before allocations are made, and authorities have been advised that a pupilshould be allowed to embark on the course desired by the parents unless thepupil is manifestly quite unfitted for it. If a parent disputes the educationauthority&apos;s view that his child is not capable of profiting from a particular course, he has the right to appeal to the Secretary of State, but very fewparents have felt it necessary to do so. As there is no shortage of places insenior secondary courses, it has in general been possible to admit to these courses all pupils who are likely to profit from them, amounting over thecountry as a whole to over a third of the total secondary intake. A pupil maybe transferred later to another course if his progress in the secondary schooljustifies it.11. While selection for secondary courses has not been the subject of widespread controversy in Scotland, there is a general desire that in a matterof such moment to both pupils and parents the method of allocation should beas simple and should bear as lightly on the pupils as is consistent with efficientassessment, and that transference between courses should be possible whereverappropriate. With these ends in view several authorities have experimentedwith simpler selection techniques and with more flexible forms of secondary
organisation designed to make it easier to meet the needs of pupils as theseemerge more clearly during the secondary course. In the eleven years that have elapsed since the Advisory Council on Education in Scotland submitted the recommendations on which the present procedure is based, much prac-J&amp;l experience of the problems involved has been gained. The time has nowufte when a further review of the subject would be profitable, and theSecretary of State accordingly proposes soon to ask the Advisory Council toconsider the organisation of secondary courses and the methods of selectionfor them.Diversification of courses12. Even the best arrangements for allocating pupils to secondary courseswill be of little avail unless the greatest possible variety of both juniorsecondary and senior secondary courses is provided in order to match thewidely varying abilities and needs found among the pupils. The high propor-tion of pupils at present admitted to senior secondary courses includes many who find courses of the traditional academic type too exacting and leave schoolprematurely. Indeed, the problem corresponding to that which has arisen in the secondary modern school in England of making suitable provision forthe best of the pupils who have just failed to gain admission to a grammarschool arises in Scotland not so much in the junior secondary courses although it exists there too as among the less able of the pupils admitted to senior secondary courses. Education authorities and other managers of schools providing such courses will be asked to ensure that the schools make afresh assessment of their pupils&apos; needs and do all they can to provide coursesthat really meet these needs.Fourth year certificate13. Besides this lack of suitable courses, investigations have suggested that many pupils following senior secondary courses who at present leave schoolwhen they reach the age of fifteen do so because they feel that the ScottishLeaving Certificate, for which they cannot at present be presented until the fifth year of the course when they are about 17, is too remote and uncertaina goal. Many of these pupils would probably stay at school if it were possible for them to obtain a Certificate in the fourth year at the age of 16or so, and at least some, having done so, might be encouraged to remain for afurther year and obtain additional passes, some of them possibly on thehigher grade. The conditions for the award of the Scottish Leaving Certificateare accordingly being amended to make it possible for a pupil in the fourthyear of a secondary course to obtain the Certificate with passes on the lower grade in as many subjects as he is capable of attempting successfully. It isintended to introduce this new lower grade or ordinary grade, as it will infuture be called in 1961, the earliest date which will give the schools areasonable period of notice.Co-ordination with further education14. Secondary education cannot be treated as something complete initself : properly conceived, it should be regarded as leading on to the various forms of further education. Some education authorities have already madeinteresting experiments designed to give pupils in the latter years of the junior secondary stage a greater sense of purpose by relating their studies tocourses in further education either directly or through school certificatesawarded on a local basis, the possession of which entitles the holder toexemption from the first stages of such courses. The Government attach the greatest importance to the closer co-ordination of all kinds of secondaryand further education and it will be one of their aims to achieve it inconjunction with the education authorities and other bodies concerned.
Advanced studies .15. Important as it is- that suitable courses should be provided forsecondary pupils of ordinary capacity, it is certainly no less important thatthe minority of high ability should receive every opportunity and encourage-ment, both in their own interest and in that of the community, to deve( ktheir talents to the utmost.  Since the Scottish Leaving Certificate has bSHTawarded on a subject instead of on a group basis, there has been a tendency for many pupils who would formerly have attempted a group of subjects in their fifth year to take only some of these in the fifth year and the remainderin the sixth year. Thus, the sixth year, which was formerly regarded mainlyas a &quot; post-certificate year&quot; in which pupils pursued selected studies at ahigher level, has come to serve the double purpose of enabling some pupilsto add to the number of their higher grade passes and of providing for others the more advanced studies traditionally appropriate to the sixth year.Consultation with educational bodies some years ago on a proposal tointroduce a new grade in the Certificate of a more exacting standard thanthe present higher grade which would normally be taken in the sixth year after a period of more intensive study of selected subjects, revealed con-siderable divergence of opinion.   The matter was not pursued further atthat time, but the question still remains whether Scotland can afford to haveno national examination of a standard beyond that of the present highergrade, at a time when it is more than ever necessary to carry the secondary education of our young people to the highest possible level.  The Secretaryof State considers that the matter is of sufficient importance to justify remittingto the Advisory Council on Education the question of the organisation of secondary education beyond the level of the new ordinary grade of theScottish Leaving Certificate.Staffing16. In some areas the size of primary classes is already falling and the decrease in primary numbers in the next few years should afford furtherrelief. The effects of the Governments measures to improve the supply of teachers are apparent in the increase in the number of graduates entering thetraining colleges from 695 in session 1957-58 to 805 in session 1958-59, andalso in the considerable increase in the non-graduate intake. If the improve-ment in the supply of primary teachers is maintained, the number of largeprimary classes will steadily decrease and the Government believe that bythe mid-sixties those with more than 40 pupils will have greatly diminishedin number.17. Nevertheless, the passage of the &quot; bulge &quot; into the secondary schooland the possible repercussions on staffing of some of the developments pro-posed in this Paper will mean an increased demand for secondary teachers.It is with this in mind that the Government have decided to grant indefinitedeferment from National Service to all trained teachers, a step which willprovide a substantial early increase in numbers. They will also considermost carefully the Report of the Advisory Council on Education on thesupply of secondary teachers which is expected shortly. A supply of well-qualified teachers is a necessary condition of any educational advance, andthe Government intend to maintain and intensify their efforts to obtain moreteachers by all practicable means.A new building programme18. A basic condition of any further educational advance is that thosewho work in our schools should be provided with satisfactory physicalconditions and with the kind of accommodation and equipment they need
in order to perform their duties efficiently. Two tasks require to be putin hand at once: the modernisation or replacement of out-of-date schoolbuddings, and the improvement of facilities m secondary schools to permit&quot; s development of the widest possible range of courses.the d(.oernisation of obsolete buildings19. With regard to the first of these tasks, as education authoritiesovertake the need for new schools to meet the growing school rolls and movements of population, they will be asked to put work in hand as rapidly as possible on the modernisation or replacement of schools, whether primaryor secondary, that are out-of-date and unsuitable for modern requirements.Hitherto they have had to concentrate on the provision of urgently requiredadditional accommodation. In consequence, while some teachers have beenable to enjoy the improved facilities and amenities of new schools, others have had to continue to work under unsatisfactory physical conditions, allthe more irksome where classes are of excessive size. Scotland has too many schools housed in nineteenth century buildings which remain much asthey were when first erected. This is true not only of the towns but also of the rural districts, where the provision of schools that conform to modemstandards is an important factor in maintaining the life of the countryside.In some cases the only satisfactory solution will be replacement; in othersextension, adaptation and modernisation may suffice. Much work alsorequires to be done in a large number of schools built in the present centuryin order to improve sanitary and washing facilities, staff rooms and play-grounds. Teachers and pupils must be given working conditions up togood modern standards in space, lighting, amenities and attractiveness ifwe are to expect them to give of their best and if we hope to secure themaximum benefit from our educational system.Improvement of secondary facilities20. With regard to the second task, where secondary schools do notyet have the best facilities for scientific, technical and practical work ofvarious kinds education authorities will be asked to provide them as soonas possible. Facilities of this kind in the new schools built in Scotlandsince the war, especially the new junior secondary schools, compare favour-ably with those in any other country. The task now must be to see that where existing schools are below standard in this respect, the necessary adaptations and improvements are put in hand without delay.22. The Government are confident that education authorities will co-operate with them to the full in their efforts to make good one of the mostserious shortcomings in our educational provision the continued use of out-of-date and unsuitable buildings. Such a step will do much to assureserving teachers of the determination of those responsible to give themconditions worthy of the work they do and to make the educational servicemore attractive. Authorities will shortly be asked to survey their require-ments and to draw up the programmes of work they will be ready to start between 1960-61 and 1964-65.
23. To effect the improvements in our schools outlined in this Paper will require, in addition to the programme of capital expenditure mentioned in paragraph 21, a substantial increase in annual expenditure mainly in order

to provide for a greater number of teachers. For their part the Government will contribute their share of such a cost, and, in fixing the grant for the first general grant period, they have taken account of the policies proposed in the White Paper. They feel sure that the education authorities will be equally ready to meet the portion of the cost that will fall upon them and to join with the Government in carrying out the advances proposed.

24. These advances are the immediate objectives which must be secured before we can come within reach of extending the compulsory period of education, whether full-time or part-time, as provided for by the Act of 1946. For the present, the Government consider that the available resources should not be dissipated in premature attempts to attain such wider objectives but must be concentrated on securing an advance on a limited front if they are to be effective. More and more young people today want to avail themselves of opportunities for secondary and further education. It is the Government&apos;s aim to ensure that the opportunities offered meet all their needs and aspirations.
