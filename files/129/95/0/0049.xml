(58) 249 Copy No.12th December, 1958CABINETSTREET OFFENCES bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Lord Privy SealOn 24th October the Home Affairs Committee authorised me to arrange forthe preparation of a Bill on street offences and the assembly of prostitutes inall-night cafes. A draft Bill was approved by the Legislation Committee on25th November, but I deferred a decision to introduce it because I wanted toconsider the feeling in the House of Commons as expressed in the Debate on theWolfenden Report on 26th November.2. In the Debate there was general agreement, among those speakers whoreferred to prostitution, that some amendment of the law was necessary, and while there was some anxiety lest legislation to clear the streets of prostitutes should result in worse evils of exploitation and corruption, most of the speakers thoughtthat the desirability of removing a public scandal outweighed the risks.3. In view of this I propose to introduce before the House rises for Christmasthe Bill circulated with this paper. The Bill implements the recommendations ofthe Wolfenden Committee that the offence of soliciting should be reformulatedwithout the element of annoyance and that a rising scale of penalties should beprovided culminating in a liability to three months&apos; imprisonment. It gives effectto suggestions which have been made to me by representatives of residents inStepney that proprietors of all-night cafes should be liable to forfeiture of thelicence on a first conviction of allowing prostitutes to assemble on the premises and to heavier monetary penalties. And it implements a recommendation in oneof the reservations to the Wolfenden Report that the penalty for living on immoralearnings or controlling prostitutes should be increased from two years&apos;imprisonment to five.4. T&apos; Bill is the result of prolonged consideration of the basic problem ofdefining the- street offence in such a way as to enable the police to take effective measures against loitering and soliciting while sufficiently safeguarding innocentwomen against arrest. It does not penalise the male customer because, although i recognise the force of the argument that morally he is as guilty as the woman, he does nothing which could be made a criminal offence: it is the woman whose activities constitute a nuisance. Nor does the Bill deal with the problem of premises used for immoral purposes. The provision of an effective means of preventing immoral user without prejudicing innocent sub-tenants would involvea difficult dovetailing of the criminal law and the civil law of property which couldnot be done without much study and consultation. I think it better to deal atonce with the immediate problem of cleaning up the streets.5. I ask my colleagues to agree to the introduction of the Bill beforeParliament rises for Christmas.R. A.
