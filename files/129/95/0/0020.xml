Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1958C. (58) 220 Copy No.22nd October, 1958CABINETINTERNATIONAL  LABOUR  organisation memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service seek the concurrence of my colleagues in a decision to denounce InternationalLabour Convention No. 43, concerning the Regulation of Hours of Work inAutomatic Sheet-Glass Works. This Convention was ratified by the UnitedKingdom in 1937 with the agreement of the one firm in this country engaged inautomatic sheet-glass production, and was applied by means of Section 3 of theHours of Employment (Conventions) Act, 1936.2. In recent years it has proved impracticable for the firm to comply withthe provisions of the Convention in regard to the working of overtime and I am satisfied that in present circumstances it would be unreasonable to require themto do so. The reasons for this are set out in detail in the Annex to this paper.Moreover, under the new Factories Bill I shall have power (subject to certain conditions being satisfied) to grant relaxations from the provisions relating tohours of employment in the Factories Act, 1937, and other analogous Acts, includingthe Hours of Employment (Conventions) Act, 1936. To alter our law in this waywill be a clear indication that we no longer aim at full compliance with our obligations under the Convention.3. In the circumstances, I think we should free ourselves from these obligations as soon as possible. This can be done by denunciation, which underthe terms of the Convention is permissible at periods occurring at intervals often years from the date on which the Convention first entered into force. Onesuch period is now current and the Convention can be denounced up to the end ofthe present year. If this is agreed, I should propose that our denunciation of theConvention should be communicated to the International Labour Organisationat the same time as the Factories Bill is introduced into Parliament.I. M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,21st October, 1958.54219CONFIDENTIALTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
ANNEXConvention No. 43 was adopted by the International Labour Conference in1934 and was ratified by the United Kingdom in January 1937, being applied inthis country by means of Section 3 of the Hours of Employment (Conventions) Act,1936. The main objectives of the Convention are to ensure that in automaticsheet-glass production (where operations are necessarily continuous):  (a) shift workers do not work more than an average of 42 hours a week in anyfour-week period (Article 2 (2) and (3)); ,(b) any one spell of work does not exceed 8 hours (Article 2 (4));(c) work proceeds on a basis of at least four shifts (Article 2(1)); and(d) overtime is worked only in case of accidents, urgent maintenancerequirements, force majeure, or the unforeseen absence of one or more members of a shift.2. There are only three factories in this country, all belonging to the samefirm, to which the provisions of the Convention have applied. Experience in recentyears has shown that in two of these factories some degree of overtime workingbeyond the provisions of the Convention has been essential, and it has been impossible for the firm to comply fully with the provisions of (a) and (d) inparagraph 1 above. The need for overtime working in these factories has arisenmainly from competition for labour under conditions of full employment and fromthe workpeople&apos;s desire for overtime pay to supplement basic wage rates. Workin the automatic sheet-glass industry is arduous, and a high proportion of applicantshave to be rejected as unfit. The ready availability of well-paid work in otherindustries encourages a high labour turnover in this industry and the firm has been compelled to carry 10 per cent, more workers than would be needed if numbersremained steady. Hours of work by men in factories are normally determined byagreements in the industries concerned, and in this respect the Act of 1936 is theonly restrictive legislation which applies to men. In thus singling out the automaticmanufacture of sheet-glass for control, the Act handicaps the firm&apos;s competitive position in the labour market.3. For strict observance of the Convention the firm would have to banovertime by shift workers in the factories in question, except in the specialcircumstances referred to in paragraph 1 (d) above. To do so would be unreasonable because:  (a) it would create immediate production difficulties;(b) it would enforce on the firm restrictions which are not imposed on its competitors in the labour market;(c) the Convention was adopted at a time of widespread unemployment,when restriction of overtime was practicable and even desirable. Itsjustification is less in conditions of full employment; and(d) in other respects too, the Convention has been overtaken by developments in the industry, e.g., improved ventilation and protection against heat,the introduction of mechanical handling, and the provision of threeweeks&apos; paid holiday; such improvements lighten the burden of overtimefor the men, while the holiday concession increases the labour problem.4. Although, more recently, with the easing of the labour market the firmhas been able to reduce overtime substantially, it has not been possible to eliminateit entirely. Labour problems are feared if overtime is further reduced. As far as can be foreseen, there is, therefore, no likelihood of the firm being able to abandonovertime working.5. It has been necessary to report to the International Labour Office thathours worked in the industry in this country have exceeded those permitted underthe Convention, and our default is already known to the International LabourConference. It is clearly undesirable that we should continue to be bound on paper by obligations which we see no prospect of carrying out.
CABINETThe attached paper by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C.(58) 221)is for consideration by the Cabinet under item 5 of the Agenda for the meeting to be held on Thursday, 23rd October.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1.22nd October, 1958.
