1secrst32(TP^fe DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 24324th November, 1958CABINETC.-PY N&quot;\  SIHORTICULTURE AND THE HORTICULTURAL TARIFFMemorandum by the President of the lizard of trade the Minister of Agriculture&apos;s paper (C. (58) 241) about horticultureraises a problem for which a new solution is needed.2.     V/e are pledged to maintain adequate incomes for those engagedin horticulture (about 50,000).    In 1953 the horticultural tariffs (whichwere mainly in the form of specific duties) were revised to take accountof changes in money values since before the war, so that when the priceof foreign supplies fell the specific tariffs would put a floor under the domestic price in the United Kingdom.3.     The new tariffs have worked well, as the National Farmers Union(N.F.U.) acknowledge, but they now say that costs in the United kingdom have risen -(i)    faster than prices in the United Kingdom;  and(ii)    faster than costs in Holland and other countries.They therefore argue that to restore profits here we must put up domesticprices by increasing the tariffs.4. On the face of the pledges given we ought to agree to do this,although on the ordinary criteria no case has been established for thetariff increase and it would be a shocking use of the tariff to raise pricesof fruit, vegetables and flowers in order to counteract the inflexibilityof the cost structure in this country and the relative inefficiency of ourgrowers.    Not only would this increase the cost of living but it would seriously prejudice our commercial relations with the supplying countries.5. I must therefore ask my colleagues to agree to the recommenda-tions of the Tariff Advisory Committee that all the N. F,U&apos;s requests for higher tariffs be rejected.    This action will appear as a breach of ourpledge to horticulture and I hope, therefore, the Minister of Agriculturewill have the support of his colleagues in looking for other ways inwhich to help this industry, and that the principle of such help will beincreased efficiency.
6. As regards timing, I agree with the Minister that rejection of the N. F. U&apos;s tariff applications should be announced simultaneously with any decision to consider a scheme for assisting horticulture.D.E.Board of Trade, S.W.1.24th November, 1958.-2-
