ASSISTANCE FOR SMALL FARMERSIntroduction1. The Government have now worked out &quot;&quot;proposals for giving further assistance to the small full-time farmer in accordance with the intentionannounced in the White Paper on the Annual Review and determination of Guarantees, 1958 (Cmnd. 390, paragraph 26). The Government have alsoreviewed the present Marginal Production Schemes and the provisions thatwill replace these are closely related to the proposals for the small farmer.They have discussed their proposals with representatives of the three Farmers&apos;*ms for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and havetaken account of advice from other responsible sources. The necessary legislation is being introduced.Policy Objectives2. A main objective of the Governments agricultural production policyis to foster a steady improvement in the industry&apos;s competitive position. Itis against this background that special consideration has been given to theposition of the small farmer. Many small farmers need to take special stepsto adapt their methods, production and resources generally if their smallfarm businesses are to earn a satisfactory living for them in conditions ofincreasing competition. The more limited financial and other resourcesgenerally available to them, as compared with larger farmers, make it par-ticularly difficult for them to take these steps. But it is important that all such businesses that are fundamentally economic should have the encourage-ment and opportunity to achieve the higher standards of efficiency and of management that are required.3. Good management in particular is a key to economic success on thesmall farm, as in farming generally. Many small farms are in practice earninggood profits. In most cases it is better management that distinguishes them from the rest. Even so, many small farms that are already reasonably wellmanaged could adopt still better management and technical practices, par-ticularly in regard to the improvement of grassland, with the object of creating the conditions in which they can become more competitive. TheGovernment through their advisory services have been placing increasingemphasis on the improvement of farm management on farms of all kinds.In the Governments view what is now needed is a special drive to encourage the smaller farmers to take&apos;advantage of modern knowledge and practice,supported by the provision of initial working capital to make such a driveeffective. Only in this way can many small farm businesses be enabled inpractice to reach the higher level of earning power which is desirable if theyare to be put on a sound footing for the future. This is the object of thenew measures which the Government have decided to introduce. These willopen up fresh opportunities for those small farmers who have the deter-mination and initiative to take advantage of the assistance now offered andwho accept the obligation to carry through the necessary improvements. Thenew measures are part of the Governments long-term policy for agricultureand are intended to contribute towards putting both the industry and theeconomic individual farm business on to a sounder basis for the future.
4. The Government have already announced that the existing marginal production Schemes are being discontinued. These schemes had their originin the war-time need for maximum output, whereas the present need is for production that is more economic. The Government have decided, however,as a transitional measure to allow time for adjustment, to give assistance for a further limited period to a number of those who have benefited frommarginal production assistance in the last few years but will not be eligiblefor the new scheme of assistance for small farmers.5. There are many farm businesses that are not capable of providingremunerative full-time employment to an ayerage occupier. A considerablenumber of these are part-time only. To the extent, however, that non-viablefarm businesses present a special problem the Government have been studyingthis and will continue to do so. The Government must not, however, beexpected to provide special financial assistance to help fundamentallyuneconomic farm businesses to remain in being, although such businesakwill continue to benefit from general agricultural subsidies. fivOutline of the Governments proposals. There are two parts to the Government^ proposals:  (i) A Small Fanner SchemeThis will provide special help to small farm businesses thatare economic in the sense that they are capable, with reasonablemanagement, of giving remunerative full-time employment to theaverage occupier. The essential basis for receiving aid under thisscheme will be that the small farmer concerned will carry out,over a period of three to five years, an approved plan for theimprovement of his farm business.(ii) A Supplementary SchemeThis is an interim measure designed to help those small farmerseligible for the Small Farmer Scheme but for whom, for one reason or another, farm business improvement plans are not immediately practicable, and to continue to give temporary assist-ance to some marginal producers who will not be eligible for theSmall Farmer Scheme.The Small Farmer Scheme7. The Scheme is intended to help a range of small farm businesses.At the lower end it is intended to include those farm businesses capableof providing, for an average occupier and with reasonable management,remunerative full-time employment, i.e. yielding a net income broadly equiva-lent to the average earnings of a skilled agricultural worker. There will bea combination of two tests to decide who is a small farmer for the purposesof this Scheme: both will relate to the farm business. To be eligible the farmbusiness must have not less than 20 and not more than 100 acres of crops and grass (other than rough grazing). But acreage by itself is not a sufficientcriterion. The acreage test will be coupled, therefore, with a test of the size of the farm business. The Government have examined possible alternativemeasures of the size of a farm business such as net income, gross output,or the amount of capital employed in the business. They have concluded that for a scheme of this kind the most appropriate criterion would be a
measure of the standard labour requirements* for the cropping and stockingof a farm. This measure takes account of all the productive processes on afarm ; it can be applied uniformly throughout the country and is one ofthe yardsticks used for farm management advisory purposes. To qualify forassistance under the Small Farmer Scheme, the farm business must be judgedcapable of. reaching standard labour requirements of at least 275 standardman-days after completion of the proposed farm business plan. It will beassumed that farm businesses with existing standard labour requirements ofnot less than 250 standard man-days are capable of doing this ; those belowthis figure will need to be considered in the light of the plans put forward.Farm businesses with standard labour requirements, based on existing croppingand stocking, of more than 450 standard man-days will not be eligible forassistance under the Small Farmer Scheme.8. Small farmers, so defined, who wish to take advantage of the scheme will have to put forward plans for the improvement of their farm businesses.Vese improvements will relate to activities for which the applicants areponsible as occupiers and must be sufficient to make the farm businesseseconomically viable or more viable. A plan will need to cover a period ofthree to five years. There will be many possibilities varying according to thccircumstances of each farm business, and the improvements to be includedin the plan will therefore vary from farm to farm. Farm business planswill be subject to the approval of the Agricultural Departments, after con-sideration by their technical advisory staff.9. Small farmers, as defined, will be eligible under the Scheme for twokinds of special grant. These will be a farm business grant, which will be payable to all those carrying out an approved farm business plan, and fieldhusbandry grants which will be payable in respect of particular groups offield operations included in the plan.10. The farm business grant is intended as a contribution towards theexpense incurred by the applicant on items, such as purchase of stock orequipment, which are an integral part of his farm business plan but arenot covered by a field husbandry grant. Since such farm business plans may include a wide variety of measures likely to contribute to better management,it would not be practicable to draw up, still less to administer, a compre-hensive schedule of the items other than field husbandry operations thatmight figure in any particular approved farm business plan. The farm businessgrant will therefore be at a standard rate which will be a total of  6 per acreof crops and grass (excluding rough grazing) in the farm business, but subjectto a maximum of  360 per farm business. Subject to satisfactory progress with the approved farm business plan, payment of the farm business grantwill be made in four equal instalments spread over a period of three years.11. The field husbandry grants will be payable, at standard rates, primarily for the improvement of land under grass, including ditching required tomake such improvement effective, but also for any minor reclamation workessential for the fulfilment of the farm business plan. Details of the fieldhusbandry grants are set out in Part I of Appendix II.12. The total assistance payable, by way of field husbandry and farmbusiness grants, under the Small Farmer Scheme will be limited to  1,000 inrespect of any farm business plan.* Standard labour requirements are the annual requirements of manual labour needed on average for the production of crops and livestock with an addition for essential farmmaintenance and other necessary tasks. The requirements are expressed in terms of &quot; standardman-days &quot; (per acre of crops or per head of livestock) which represent 8 hours&apos; manual workfor an adult male worker under average conditions. This is explained in greater detail inAppendix I.
13. The Government have considered the alternative of providing loansrather than grants. They have concluded that these would be open to serious objections. Repayable advances, which should in principle be at normal ratesof interest, would not in most cases give the small farmers sufficient help and encouragement to make the necessary changes in their farm practice and management. But in any case the aim is that small farmers should be helped without adding to the Exchequer commitments to agriculture. Anysubstantial loan fund additional to the resources already available would be inconsistent with this. It is clear, however, that the improvements to farmbusinesses that will now be open to many small farmers will make them more credit-worthy and will therefore make it easier for them to obtainextra credit from normal sources, if that is needed as well as the grants.The Supplementary Scheme14. This will provide in the first place for interim assistance, on a simplerbasis than under the Small Farmer Scheme, to small farmers for wh^papproved farm business plans are not immediately practicable, e.g. beciWthey themselves are not ready to embark on such plans or because trieAgricultural Departments cannot yet handle their applications.15. Secondly, this Scheme will be used to provide temporary assistance,for a period of three years, for the purpose of easing the position of someof those farmers who have been benefiting under the existing marginal production Schemes but who will not be eligible for the Small FarmerScheme.16. For both purposes the assistance in England and Wales and inNorthern Ireland will take the form of special grants supplementary to thepayments made under the existing schemes for contributions towards the costof ploughing, liming, ditching and the supply of fertilisers. In Scotland, whereconditions are somewhat different, both purposes will be achieved by theprovision for three years of a revised Marginal Agricultural ProductionScheme, under which assistance will be given to a more limited class of applicants than under the previous Scheme.17. Conditions of eligibility and particulars of the special assistance are set out in Part II of Appendix II.Numbers of Farmers affected by the new Schemes18. Although there are over 500,000 agricultural holdings in the UnitedKingdom, a large number of these are part-time or spare-time holdings, while others are not separate farms. It is estimated that the number of full-timefarm businesses in the United Kingdom is at present not much more than300,000. More than two-thirds of the full-time farmers either have more than100 acres of crops and grass or are likely to be above the size of businessqualification for the Small Farmer Scheme. It is expected that most of theremainder, or something like 65,000 full-time farmers, will be eligible forassistance under the Small Farmer Scheme or, as an alternative, the Supple-mentary Scheme. In addition, about 25,000 former recipients of marginalassistance are expected to be eligible only for the Supplementary Scheme(or for the revised Marginal Agricultural Production Scheme in Scotland),making a total of about 90,000 farm businesses that may benefit under oneor other of the new Schemes.Cost of the new Schemes19. It is estimated that in the first full year of their operation the costof the new Schemes may be of the order of  6 million for the Small Farmer
Scheme and  3 million for the Supplementary Scheme (and the revisedMarginal Agricultural Production Scheme in Scotland). Against this total ofabout  9 million has to be offset the current annual cost, about  3 million,of the existing Marginal Production Schemes which are being discontinued.This leaves a net additional expenditure of about  6 million which will betaken into account at the 1959 Annual Review as part of the guarantees and production grants to the industry. There will also be consequential additional expenditure under existing grant and subsidy schemes as more advantage istaken of these. While the full extent of this cannqj: be estimated, it is likely that the improved husbandry practices resulting from the new Schemes will involve additional expenditure of some  3- 4 million a year under the existingproduction grant schemes for ploughing, fertilisers and lime.20. These estimates are based on the assumptions that farm business plans for some 25,000 small farmers in the United Kingdom may be approved inthe first full year of operation of the Small Farmer Scheme and that althought&apos; &quot;^jniount of grant will vary from farm to farm the average amount perfuW, taking farm business and field husbandry grants together, will be ofthe order of  240 in the first year and about  700 over the three to five-year period for which each improvement scheme will run.Introduction of the new Schemes21. Subject to the necessary legislative authority the Small Farmer scheme will come into operation on 1st April, 1959. In order that work undeiapproved farm business plans may start immediately after that date, theGovernment propose that the opening date for the submission of applicationsshall be early in 1959. The special grants under the Supplementary scheme will be payable on ploughing and ditching carried out and on fertilisers andlime supplied on and after 1st July, 1959.22. The receipt of some applications before 1st April, 1959, and theprovision of alternative assistance under the Supplementary Scheme should help to reduce the initial pressure of work involved in examining farm businessplans under the Small Farmer Scheme. Nevertheless, that work will impose a heavy strain on the available resources of skilled advisory staff, and sometime must elapse before applications from all those who may wish to takeearly advantage of the Small Farmer Scheme can be dealt with. While theservices of the Governments advisory staff will continue to be available tothe agricultural industry generally, it must be recognised that for some timeto come the new measures to assist small farmers must have first claim onthe available advisory resources.23. The Government are satisfied that the introduction of these arrange-ments and the devotion to them of the resources required is fully in line with the objective of making production more economic and the industrymore competitive. The necessary finance for the new grants will accordingly be provided by a comparatively small redistribution of resources, withinthe total of the guarantees already given to the industry, for measures thatare in the long-term interest of a stable and efficient agriculture.
APPENDIX ITHE USE OF STANDARD LABOUR REQUIREMENTS to measure THE SIZE OF A FARM BUSINESS1. Eligibility for the Small Farmer Scheme will be determined in part by the acreage of crops and grass farmed by the applicant. Acreage by itself is not, however,a sufficient measure of the size of a farm business. When judged by economic or financial criteria such as volume of labour and other resources used, or the volumeof production achieved, some farms of relatively small acreage must be regarded as large businesses. On the other hand, some farms with larger acreages of less fertileor hill land support only small-scale farm businesses.2. The acreage test is therefore to be coupled with a test of size of business. Forthis purpose the various crop and livestock enterprises whijeh constitute a farm businesshave to be added together, in order to determine whether it qualifies for assistance asa small farm. To do this a &quot; weight&quot; has to be given to each acre of crops and eachhead of livestock. The &quot; weights &quot; which have been adopted for the present purposeare the requirements of manual labour (normally the annual requirements) needed on average for the production of crops and livestock, with an addition for essential farmmaintenance and other necessary tasks. The requirements are expressed in tenns of&quot; standard man-days &quot; (per acre of crops or per head of livestock), which repMKVUeight hours&apos; manual work for an adult male worker under average conditionsBP1 ismethod of measuring size of business is simple to use and is suitable for uniformapplication throughout the country.3. For the purposes of illustration, a provisional list of standard labour require-ments is given below; this may, however, be revised or augmented before the new schemes come into operation.Standard StandardCrops Man-days Crops Man-days(per acre) (per acre)31 Hardy nursery stock......    504i Bulbs and flowers in the open    50 -7for stock-Wheat, barley, ryeOats, mixed cornBeans and peas .feeding      ......... 4 Potatoes seed       ...... 23 ware       ...... 20Turnips and swedes for stock-feeding and mangolds     ... 12Sugar beet and fodder beet ... 17Rape (or Cole)       ...... 2\Cabbage, kale, savoys and kohlrabi for stockfeeding      ... 7Vetches or tares      ...... 4 Flax    ............ 15Hops............ 100Orchards with small fruit be-low the trees       ...... 55Other orchards       ...... 25Small fruit     ......... 45Vegetables for  human  con-sumption:Brussels sprouts    ...... 25Cabbage and cauliflowers... 17Kale and sprouting broccoli 17Carrots,  parsnips,  turnipsand swedes, beetroot   ... 21Peas, green......... 35Peas, for harvesting dry ... 4%Tomatoes, grown in the open 50All other vegetables       ... 45Hardy nursery stock ...Bulbs and flowers in the openOther crops in the openBare fallow   .........Grass for mowing...... for grazing -......Crops under glassTomatoesOther cropsLivestockDairy cows in milk or in calf,and heifers in milk......Beef cows      .........Bulls   ............Other cattle   .........Breeding sows and gilts, andboars        .........Pigs fattened or reared forbreeding    .........Sheep one year old and over:upland       .........lowland     .........Sheep under one year old ...Poultry 6 months old and overunder 6 months oldi2i(Per100sq.ft.of glass)4.      4iStandardMan-days(per head)154i730-6Notes:(i) An addition of 15 per cent for essential maintenance and other indirect labour will be made to the standard labour requirements of the farm business as calculatedfrom the cropping and stocking. ,(ii) Appropriate adjustments will be made when livestock are not kept for a full year.
4. Since the stocking of a farm fluctuates during the year consideration will begiven to the normal stocking of the farm, rather than to the number of livestockcarried on any particular day. (For pigs, the number fattened during the year will beused.) Similarly for the purposes of the calculation regard will be had to whether theexisting cropping of the farm is normal for that farm.5. The standard labour requirements as calculated for a farm business may formany reasons differ from the actual amount of labour employed.. The degree ofmechanisation, the topography of the land and the layout of the buildings, and theefficiency of operation, are some of the more important factors affecting the actualamount of labour used on a farm. In any case, the calculation measures the size of the farm business under average management, not the efficiency with which manual labour is used on individual farms.6. The following examples, based on actual cases, illustrate how the standardlabour requirements of a farm business will be calculated in order to ascertain whetherit will qualify for assistance under the Small Farmer Scheme: k Dairy Farm (49 acres of crops and grass)Oats...............Kale...Temporary grass mowing grazingPermanent grass mowing grazingTotal acreage of crops and grassDairy cows............Other cattle        .........Poultry 6 months old and over  ...Plus 15 per cent for overheadsTotal standard labour requirements		Standard		Man-days2 acres x 4*		92	x 7	143	x 2	64	x  i	115   ,,	x 2	3023   ,,	x  i	5*49		No.	-	13 x	15	19510 x	3	30300 x	0-3	90		380J	...	57		437 (ii) Mixed Farm (32* acres of crops and grass) StandardMan-daysPermanent grass-mowing       .........   10* acres x 2^       21-grazing        ......Dairy cows.........Other cattlePoultry 6 months old and over22 ,, x i 5*No.12 x 15 1808x3 2440 x  0-3 12242*Plus 15 per cent for overheads      ..,      ......... 36*Total standard labour requirements............ 279

The proposed standard rates for these are set out below. Grants will be additional to any other production grants that may be payable in respect of the operations inquestion. The rates have been calculated so as to secure that the total assistance byway of field husbandry grant and any other relevant production grant will generallyrepresent all but a small part of the cost of the work.2. Field Husbandry Grants will be payable as follows: (a) for the improvement of land which has been under grass for at least threeyears by ploughing, cropping and reseeding to grass; or by ploughing,pioneer cropping and reseeding; or by ploughing and directly reseeding  9 a year per acre so improved, for the period necessary to complete thework in accordance with the approved plan or for three years, whichever isthe shorter. (The intention is that farmers shall be advised on a husbandryprogramme appropriate for each field to be improved, the programmebeing either for three years, e.g. ploughing to oats, fodder crops and re-seeding; or for two years, e.g. ploughing to a pioneer crop and reseeding;or for one year, e.g. ploughing and directly reseeding in the same year);(b) for the renovation of any land under grass by methods other than ploughing(e.g. discing), followed by dressing and, if necessary, by reseeding a totalof  9 per acre so improved, spread over a period of up to three years accord-ing to the particular plan;(c) for ditching work necessary for the purpose of making any of the aboveeffective  1 per chain;id) for reclamation work essential for the fulfilment of the farm business plan such an amount, not exceeding  100, as will, when added to any other grants and subsidies attracted by the reclamation work, bring the total assistanceup to 85 per cent of the gross cost. Reclamation work so grant-aided will not qualify for assistance under the Farm Improvement Scheme.
PART II-SUPPLEMENTARY SCHEME3. The circumstances in England and Wales and Northern Ireland on the one handand Scotland on the other are somewhat different and have been reflected in separateMarginal Production Schemes in the past. The new arrangements will be as follows.England and Wales and Northern Ireland4. To be eligible for assistance an applicant will have to show either (i) that his farm business embraces not less than 20 and not more than 100acres of crops and grass; and that its standard labour requirements arenot less than 250 and not more than 450 standard man-days; or(ii) that his farm business embraces not less than 10 and not more than 150 acres of crops and grass; that its standard labour requirements are not less than150 and not more than 450 standard man-days; and that the small farm hasbenefited under the Marginal Production Schemes at some time since 1st August, 1953.T^Pt Assistance under the Supplementary Scheme will take the form of special grants made concurrently with, and in addition to, payments under the existing schemes for contributions towards the cost of ploughing, liming, ditching and thesupply of fertilisers. For ploughing the supplementary grant will be  5 an acre inaddition to the normal  7 an acre payable under Part I of the Ploughing grants scheme. For liming there will be a supplementary grant of 15 per cent of the cost inaddition to the payment calculated at the normal rate, which at present is 60 per cent of the cost. For ditching there will be an additional payment of 35 per cent of the cost,bringing the total assistance up to 85 per cent instead of the normal 50 per cent ofthe cost. For fertilisers the normal contribution is at varying rates for different types of fertiliser and is subject to a maximum of 50 per cent of the cost; the special grant payable in addition will be equal to 75 per cent of the normal contribution.6. There will be limits to the maximum yearly entitlement to the supplementarygrants other than that for ditching. These limits will be  50 for ploughing (i.e. 10 acresat the supplementary rate of  5 which would be paid in addition to the normal  7 per acre);  45 for the additional fertiliser subsidy; and  10 for the additional lime subsidy.7. The provisions for payment of supplementary assistance to persons qualifyingunder paragraph 4(i) above will be reviewed in the light of the progress of the small farmer Scheme. Supplementary assistance to persons qualifying only under para-graph 4(h) above will be limited to ploughing and ditching work carried out and fertilisers and lime supplied during the period of three years ending 30th June, 1962.Scotland8. In Scotland, instead of a Supplementary Scheme, a revised Marginal agricultural production Scheme will be introduced for three years. The system of annual grants forcropping, reseeding and regeneration of grazings that has operated in previous years will be continued. As before assistance will be at standard rates subject to a maximum,including other grants, of 85 per cent of the gross cost.9. This continued assistance will be given to a more limited class of applicantsthan under the previous Scheme. Although marginality of land will still be a qualifica-tion, size of farm business will also be taken into account. Many substantial businesseson farms at present classed as marginal are already capable of providing a reasonablelivelihood to the farmer without further special assistance. These together with anumber of very small units which have from time to time in the past received marginalassistance grants, will no longer qualify for such assistance.(31403)   Wt. 775-      7,81   10/48   D.L.
