secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1958C. (58) 244 Copy No.1st December, 1958CABINETPENSIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and the Lord Privy SealOn 25th September, 1958, the Cabinet agreed to defer their consideration ofthe question whether in principle the quinquennial increases in contributionproposed in the White Paper on Pensions should be applied to the exchequer supplement (C.C. (58) 72nd Conclusions, Minute 1). The Ministerial Committeeon Pensions, under my Chairmanship, have examined this question and have also considered a number of possible ways in which the Governments scheme mightbe adjusted both in substance and in presentation.The Exchequer Contribution2. The question for our consideration was whether the Exchequer contribution should be permanently fixed at  170 millions a year as proposed in the White Paper,or whether it should be increased quinquennially at the same time as those ofthe employers and employees. An increase in the Exchequer contributionproportionate to the other two would involve an additional sum of  10 millionsat each of the four quinquennial increases. Against this there must be set the factthat by contributing  170 millions a year at the outset the Exchequer would be making a contribution of considerably more than a quarter of the income fromminimum contributions. A quinquennial increase in the Exchequer contribution would also mean increasing it in the years when the Pensions Fund would alreadybe in surplus.3. We agreed, therefore, on a compromise whereby the exchequer contribution would remain at  170 millions a year until such time as that figurefell below a quarter of the income from minimum contributions: it would thenbe increased to bear that proportionate relationship. The effect of this compromisewould be that the Exchequer contribution would not be raised at the firstquinquennial review; would rise by  8 millions at the second; and would increase by  13 to  14 millions at each of the two subsequent quinquennial reviews. Atthe same time, by accepting the principle of Exchequer participation, the concept of a three-sided partnership would be maintained. I invite my colleagues to endorsethis proposal.Possible Adjustments to the scheme. We also considered the following suggestions for adjusting theGovernments scheme. Most of them we have felt bound to reject but there isone notable exception, namely, a proposal to make concessions in respect of the earnings rule for retirement and widow pensioners, and widowed mothers.54392
The Lower-Paid Worker5. There has been some criticism of the scheme on the ground that, sincethe graduated element does not start till earnings reach  9, the many workers(particularly women) who earn less than  9 are &quot; excluded from the scheme &quot; inthe sense that, though their contributions are reduced, they cannot qualify fora better pension than at present. This criticism could be met by abandoning thereduction in the present contribution and using the revenue so gained to provide an improvement in the standard or graduated rate of pension.6. We were satisfied that the small additional pensions so offered would have little appeal compared to the benefit of a reduced contribution. Moreover, atsome point in time an increase in the basic rate of benefit will become inevitable and it would be politically prudent to leave ourselves with some room for manoeuvre to adjust the financial structure of the scheme at that time. I invitemy colleagues to endorse our recommendation to stand meantime by the proposals in the White Paper, namely, to improve the position of the lower-paid worker by wayof a reduction in his National Insurance Contribution.Existing Pensions7. We agreed that despite pressure we should not at this stage consider making any improvement in the rates for existing pensioners. When the lastincrease was granted it was designed to do rather more than compensate forcost-of-living increase up to that point in time, and we think that the small movementso far in the retail price index does not necessitate action to improve the benefitsat present. Politically nothing less than 10s. would have any attraction; and anincrease of that order would cost about  200 millions a year initially. I must,however, draw my colleagues&apos; attention to one emergent difficulty, to which we gaveparticularly careful consideration. It seems certain that there will be a significantrise in the level of the retail price index over the next few months, but that theposition will probably be substantially recovered by the middle of 1959. Weshall, therefore, come under heavy pressure which may be difficult to resist at thetime of the Second Reading and Committee Stages of the Bill. Nevertheless, we feel that we should not be rushed into raising the benefit rates (with the corollary of raising contributions) in face of what we are satisfied will be a passing difficulty.We shall, however, keep the position constantly under review. I invite mycolleagues to endorse this conclusion.Review of Rates8. Pressure to review the rate of pensions under the National Insurancescheme at frequent intervals has been increased by the mistaken impression thatthe Government^ acceptance of the recommendations of the Grigg Committeeinvolves a biennial review of pensions in payment. The Bill will maintain theprovisions of the National Insurance Act, 1946, for quinquennial reviews of benefit and contribution rates. In support of more frequent reviews it can be argued thatthese provide some measure of protection against inflation (but any action takenwould affect contributions as well as benefits). To accept this proposal could have some advantages in presentation. On the other hand, any Minister of Pensionsmust have rates continually under review, and a statutory provision for veryfrequent formal statistical exercises would involve a substantial amount of unnecessary administrative work and might create a presumption in the public mind that reviews would be favourable. We were inclined to the view that weshould not exclude the possibility of more frequent reviews, but that the Bill shouldnot be altered at this stage to make provision for this. We would recommend thatthe Minister of Pensions should be given considerable latitude in Committee, butthat he should consult his colleagues again before agreeing to accept reviews at less than quinquennial intervals. I invite my colleagues to endorse this view.Immediacy, Increments and the Earnings Rule9. It is in this field that there is most scope for making improvement. Thereare three distinct possibilities:  (i) To make a concession in respect of the earnings rule for retirement andwidow pensioners and widowed mothers;
(ii) to shorten the period for which a person who defers retirement has towork in order to earn an increment on his basic pension;(iii) to improve the rate of increments so earned.The first of these possibilities would undoubtedly be the most popular and is simpleto introduce. A concession could be justified on grounds of the generally increasedlevel of earnings. Subject to the concurrence of the Chancellor of the exchequer we were agreed that the earnings disregard on the present basis should be raised from 50s. to 60s. for retirement and widow pensioners and from 60s. to 80s. forwidowed mothers.10. We felt that there were merits in the other two possibilities which required further consideration. The present level of increments was fixed in 1951, and hascome in for a good deal of criticism. In addition it is at present possible for up to24 of the 25 contributions required to earn a further increment to be wasted ifretirement occurs shortly before the end of a 25-week period. The proposal beforeus was to provide an increment of Is. for 12 contributions instead of the present is. 6d. for 25 contributions. This concession would be popular and could beintroduced before the new legislation came into effect. On the other hand, thecost, though very small at the outset, would build up gradually to about  20 millions a year in the year 1979-80.11. I invite my colleagues to agree, subject to the views of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, to a concession in respect of the earnings rule for retirement andwidow pensioners and widowed mothers. I also ask my colleagues to considerthe. proposal mentioned in &quot;the previous paragraph for improving the increments.Other Suggestions12. We agreed that there were no sufficient grounds for introducing a graduated benefit for widows under 60 since this would depart from the basicprinciple of the White Paper that the scheme is one of provision for old age and todo so might also have repercussions on other special classes. We agreed that therewere considerable difficulties in the way of providing for voluntary membership of the graduated part of the State scheme for the self-employed. We also agreedthat despite some presentational advantages an obligation on employers to hold apoll before exercising their right to contract out would give rise to substantialdifficulties and many anomalies. I ask my colleagues to endorse these conclusions.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,1st December, 1958.
