The purpose of this tour, on which I was accompanied by Mr. Harold^LmW ? Evans, Adviser on Public Relations to the Prime Minister and to me, was to study^L-W I information work and problems on the spot, and to make some assessment of the^LmW I effectiveness of what is being done. The impressions gained and the views formed^LmW I fall conveniently under five main headings:COUNTERING CAIRO^LmW 3.  The main broadcasting programmes heard, or intended to be heard, in the^LmW H area visited-Aden and the Horn of Africa-are: -^^^fl                                                                                                       Hours per week w-WMmwAmM                 British Broadcasting Corporation     In Arabic .........                                     66  ^^^b^Lmm                    {B.B.C.)

In Arabic ......... 12 ^^^^* Virtually controlled by Cairo Radio. ^^^H^LmW M Wherever we went in the Horn of Africa or in Aden, we were told that the\mmm\ Bpropaganda from Cairo Radio in one language or another was having a pernicious,^LmW Hdangerous and growing effect and that present efforts to combat its influence were^LmW ?totally inadequate.  Cairo is winning, and winning fast.  The matter is one of^LmW ?extreme urgency.^L-W 4.  B.B.C. programmes were not considered equal to the task though the news^LmWrn ?bulletins were useful in that they provided a different and more reliable assessment^LmWrn T lof the day&apos;s news. The inadequacy arose from-^L-W (a) the stronger and easier-to-get signal from Cairo,^LmW (b) the failure to put news items into perspective,SECRET
SECRET(c) lack of colour and emotion in commentaries,(d) livelier entertainment from Cairo, and(e) the failure to deal directly, forthrightly and immediately with the lies and ^mWMallegations streaming out of Cairo. ^kwM5. There was at the same time a recognition of the fact that the basic attitude i^H^^Hof the Arab and Islamic peoples was bound to be sympathetic to material from ^kwM^mWM\               Cairo bolstering Arab nationalism and sentiments of Pan-Arabism. Even with the ^kwMnon-Arab and non-Islamic peoples of East Africa the anti-colonial and &quot; Africa ^kwMfor the Africans&quot; propaganda struck a responsive chord. ^mWM6. Because of these basic attitudes, opinion about the desirability of direct Mmm&quot; rebuttal &quot; programmes showed some variations, though even those who thought ^kwM^mwU it unwise for counter-propaganda to be provocative agreed that some counter-action needed to be taken.  No one advocated descending with Cairo into the ^kwMgutter.  In Aden, where the problem is at its most acute, both civil and military ^kwMopinion urged an immediate policy of vigorous rebuttal, linked with lively Hentertainment, transmitted on a powerful signal. If there is no prospect of such a MWMpolicy being implemented quickly, then so serious is the situation considered to be H ^kwMthat Aden would wish to have Cairo Radio jammed, together with financial and ^kwM^kwM              technical help if it is carried out locally. ^kwMmmm\            mwi&apos; $i  It was generally agreed that the B.B.C. should not be asked to abandon its ^kwMtraditional policy of objectivity, but that within that policy:-^kwM                    (a) there should be adopted a technique of putting of news items into their ^kwMcontext so that, for example, a hostile and misleading statement should ^mWM^kwM                             not be offered in isolation and with the apparent seal of B.B.C. authority; ^kwM(b) commentaries, without departing from broad objectivity, should be ^mWMcouched in emotional and colourful terms in a manner appealing toArab, Somali and African listeners; WMM(c) the entertainment element in the Arabic programmes should be given ^mWMgreater&quot; popular&quot; appeal; ^mwM(d) the B.B.C. should be a little less diffident about giving news of British ^kwMachievement. In some quarters, indeed, it was felt that the B.B.C. was ^mWMWwMft                            so determined to be &quot; objective &quot; that sometimes it gave the balance of ^mwMadvantage to anti-British and unfriendly views and became, quite H WMMgratuitously, a channel for such views. ^mWMI                    8.  Because no one saw the B.B.C. as an instrument for a more robust policy ^mwMof rebuttal, news of the Berbera project for relaying B.B.C. programmes was ^mwMI              received with no more than moderate gratification. The mere strengthening of the ^mwMB.B.C. signal was not seen as an adequate approach to the Cairo problem. Modified, I II              the B.B.C. programmes could do more. But even then they would not provide the ^mWM9. What is needed, in addition to the B.B.C&apos;s modified but still &quot; objective &quot; ^kwMoutput, is rebuttal or correction material regularly broadcast and following swiftly ^kwEI              on the Cairo lies.  First, the local programmes need a prompt and regular flow Hof monitoring reports with guidance on rebuttal.   Kenya would use it with ^mWMI              enthusiasm-indeed they have begun their own monitoring and rebuttal service ^kwMI               though they admit its inadequacy. Hargeisa would probably do the same. Aden ^mWMmight use it though it prefers rebuttal to come from elsewhere.  Secondly, and ^mwMI               even more important, Berbera should be used, not only for relaying B.B.C. ^mwMprogrammes in Arabic, Somali and Swahili, but for a lively rebuttal programme. I ^kwMI               One line of thought tends to a commercial service on the Sharq-el-Adna model. BmMYet Sharq never thought it wise to engage in overt propaganda; moreover, a full ^mwMI              service of this kind would presumably require more time than the Berbera station ^mWMcould offer.   What is suggested is a service which goes on the air for, say, ^mwMhalf-an-hour daily at a peak listening time and reviews and comments on what is ^mWMH               being said currently by Middle East stations, including Cairo. Such a service might I ^mwMcall itself simply the Middle East Monitoring Service. This suggestion links with WmM^kwM               the need, expressed forcibly in East Africa, for a monitoring service able to provide ^kwMimmediate monitoring reports, together with lines of guidance for use by the local m &apos;WmjAwmbroadcasting and information services. The two jobs could be done by the same ^mWMorganisation.10. There remains the problem that Berbera will not be on the air for at H ^LwM^mwM               least 18 months.  Nevertheless, reports and guidance from a monitoring service WmwMSECRET ^kW
SECRETI would have immediate value for the local information (including radio) services ^^^hmmm\ I 1 I anc^    *s therefore recommended that consideration should be given urgently toI the ways and means by which such a service could be set up quickly. It might beW^-M      I $tpected to have its foundations in the present monitoring operations of the B.B.C.I Mm and the main &quot; processing &quot; (analysis and guidance) might be done at the outset^LwM &apos;9JH in London, possibly with a branch office in Nairobi, or some other central point,Mum I 1 I f r preparation of guidance on local as distinct from international issues. Since^L^Lm      I speed is the essence of the operation, it would be necessary to, have direct radio-I teleprinter links with the appropriate points in East Africa and the Horn of Africa.11. Unless the Aden Broadcasting Service is willing to include &quot; rebuttal &quot; inmmu I 1 I &apos;ts Pr grarnrnes, based on a monitoring service of the kind described, it is difficultI to see what immediate action could be .taken to meet Aden&apos;s particular needs, shortI of jamming. One suggestion has been made, however, that a television servicemum I I should be set up in the Colony. The concentration of population might be held toI warrant such a service and even Cairo might find it difficult to compete with mereI sound. Though the circumstances are not parallel, the same line of thinking led toI I the setting up of a television service in Cyprus and some enquiry might be made intoI experience there. The Pye firm has shown some interest and should be encouragedI to12. A number of other suggestions emerged during the discussions and someI I of these are included in the following: -I Summary of Recommendations(a) The B.B.C. should be asked to consider, without any departure from itsI traditional policy of objectivity, the points of presentation outlined inparagraph 5.ib) There should be set up a monitoring organisation which would provide aj service of monitoring reports, analysis and guidance for use of the j^^Hbroadcasting and information services in the Horn of Africa area. Suchan organisation, which could be called the Middle East MonitoringII Service, should in addition originate a daily forthright rebuttalprogramme which should be transmitted from or via Berbera. It shouldbe organised, directed and financed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.II (c) An early conference should be called of representatives of the broadcasting^-M and information services in the area to secure (what is at present lacking)the best possible use of joint resources and continuing co-ordination ofI&apos;l(d) Consideration should be given to the, possibility of supplying the localI services with tape recordings of propaganda talks and commentariesII prepared in London.(e) The possibility should be immediately investigated of securing a betterI I supply of records of Arabic music and entertainment.  If this is simplya question of cost, ways and means should be found of overcomingthe difficulty.  In particular, use might be sought of the Arabic materialII accumulated in Cyprus.(/) A United Kingdom Information Office should be set up in Nairobi at theearliest possible moment with a view, not least, to distributing LondonPress Service, received by radio and edited (the Kenya Government hassaid that it will now formally ask that such an office be instituted).II (g) Any possible help should be given to the local broadcasting services instrengthening their services, both technically and in programme content.In particular, a Post Office radio engineer should be sent to Hargeisa toI| advise on current technical problems.^L^L\ (h) Every effort should be made to establish helpful liaison with RadioMogadishu.1| (/) The Berbera project should proceed With the maximum despatch, and inparticular a decision should be taken about the piling contract beforea firm of contractors, recently operating in Berbera, removes the: a equipment it has there.v (j) In view of doubts about the extent to which Berbera will provide a stronger ^^flsignal in East Africa, there should be an early investigation into thepossible need for a further boosting operation to serve that area.i| (k) A technical investigation should be made of jamming possibilities withoutat this stage any commitment on the principle.SECRET^Lm 54igi b 2 ^Lm
SECRETB.B.C. EXTERNAL SERVICES13. The External Services comprise broadcasts in a variety of foreignlanguages together with the General Overseas Service in English, which is on the^^^M air for 21  hours daily and accounts for rather more than  1J millions, a substantial 1^^^1 proportion of the total cost of the External Services.14. Since the External Services were instituted there has been a markedchange in the circumstances in which broadcasting across frontiers has been Hconducted. To-day there are few countries in which there are not highly developedlocal services transmitting a clear signal on medium wave. Both because of theirlocal appeal and their strong signal these -services inevitably tend to dominatelistening. There is less and less short-wave listening to foreign stations, especiallyif the short-wave signal is in the least difficult to hear.  Moreover, television isbeginning to be introduced.15. It would seem, therefore, that there should be a further examination ofL^^h the nature and organisation of the External Services.  At present the External ^^flServices take some  6 millions of the  15 millions allocated for the overseasinformation services, with the British Council spending  4 millions and the officialinformation services  5 millions. It may well be that there should now be areadjustment in these proportions.16. In particular, the usefulness of the General Overseas Service in its presentform seems suspect. That the Service had little significance was the almost ^^flunanimous view in the seven countries I visited. Its appeal for foreign audiencesis obviously limited, not only by the language barrier but also because it largelycomprises programmes reproduced from the home services. The English-speakinglistener, even when he has been educated in the United Kingdom, finds little_^^H attraction in &quot; Take It From Here &quot; and talks on &quot; Memories of Queen Alexandra.&quot;If he listens at all, therefore, it is to the news and commentaries-and theprobability is that the signal will be so difficult to get, without a powerful receiverand some &quot; fiddling,&quot; that unless he is an exceptional enthusiast he will cease todo even that.17. What then of the British communities overseas? Does the GeneralOverseas Service not represent for them a powerful link with home? The answerseems to be &quot; No,&quot; with the important exception of the news and commentariesand outside broadcasts of great national events and sporting occasions.  This is ^^flnot simply because of the difficulties of listening on short-wave.   In tropicalcountries there tends to be a fairly active social life and there is little dispositionto think in terms of knitting by the radio. There is an eagerness for good musicbut this is met by the long-playing high-fidelity record.  Where there are settlercommunities, with local services in English, as in Kenya, a fair amount of theGeneral: Overseas Service is usually relayed, but here again the main interest liesin news and commentaries and outside broadcasts and for the rest it is arguedthat a transcription service would meet the need better than live broadcasts. Givena transcription service with the best of the home programmes available on disc ortape, the local service would be able to make its own selections and fit them intoits own programmes and would not be subjected to the disadvantage of relayinga short-wave signal of uneven quality.18. For foreign language broadcasts from the B.B.C. there seems to bea significant audience only to the extent that relay is possible through local services.In practice, this means in Aden and the Horn the broadcasting services of ColonialGovernments. The Swahili and Somali services are valued because of this and theArabic service to a lesser extent. The Arabic service seems to command some directlistening, though almost solely for the news. In India and Pakistan the vernacular Ibroadcasts are generally said to have little point.  Quite apart from difficulties ofreception, the scale of listening is so small-in the whole of India there are only k1,200,000 licensed sets-that there can be little hope of gaining a regular audience Wof any importance, especially when the competition of All-India Radio and&apos;acommercial programme from Ceylon are borne in mind. The educated Indian, ifhe wishes to listen to the B.B.C., will do so in English.SECRET
SECRET19.  The following conclusions emerge:-^^B (a) The B.B.C. should be invited to examine the structure of the General^k-WM Overseas Service in the light of the comments and arguments set out in^^B I                  this note, and to submit recommendations.wMMM (b) The vernacular broadcasts to India and Pakistan should be abandoned, with ^^fl^k\\\ the possible exception of Hindi, which it might be desirable to maintain^k\\\ for purely diplomatic reasons.^L\\A WMM Separate recommendations have been put forward about the content andwMMMM Bpresentation of programmes in the Arabic Service.BRITISH COUNCILWXWM 20.  On the premise that the British Council is the instrument of Her Majesty&apos;s^^B     BGovernment in the educational no less than the cultural field, there is clearly muchBscope for British Council activities in those countries of Asia and Africa whereBeducation is expanding and the people are eager for knowledge. By helping to cater^^B     Bfor these needs the British Council can not only build up a fund of goodwill for this ^^B^^B     Bcountry&apos; but a^so cause the new generation to look to Britain for example, ideas ^^B^^B     Ban^ inspiration.  There is an especially rich opportunity in those countries where^^B     B^n8^sn ^s the principal second language.  The work must be down-to-earth and^^B   ^Bpractical, however, and backed by sufficient funds to make a significant impact. I ^^B^^B     Bam considering plans for strengthening the teaching of English, particularly in India ^^B^^B     Ban^ Pakistan. ^^B^^B 21.   Much depends on the qualifications and personality of the Representative ^^B^^B ^?and his staff.   Men selected for work of this kind should have the necessary ^^B^^B Bbackground of experience in the administration and practice of teaching services, ^^B^^B BPar^cu^ar^y Pei&apos;haps m adult education. In this connection it is of great importance ^^B^^B flor the success of the work about to begin in Somalia that the Representative ^^B^^B ^Hshould have both the appropriate educational qualifications and a ieal enthusiasm ^^B^^B Bfor working with &quot; emerging &quot; peoples. ^^B^^B 22.  In India the High Commissioner and his staff are keenly aware that, ^^B^^B Btnousn to-day the leaders in politics, administration, business and education were ^^B^^B flail educated in Britain and feel strong ties of affection for Britain, yet this is a ^^B^^B Bwasting asset anc* the rising generation will not have these ties.  They are also ^^B^^B Ba^arme&lt;^ by the declining standards of English.   They feel, therefore, that the ^^B^^B BBritish Council has a really vital role to play, both in helping to preserve the place ^^B^^B I Bsf English m Indian life and in fostering cultural links between the two countries. ^^B^^B B^e High Commissioner believes that British&apos; character and distinction are best ^^B^^B B*uustrated in the persons of its leading citizens and would like the British Council ^^B^^B Bto be one of the instruments for bringing such people on visits to India. He^^B BDeneves a^so that the expense of bringing some of the principal British actors and ^^B^^B B3^1&quot;68868 t  India, and even of bringing companies such as the Old Vic, would be ^^B^^B Babundantly justified.  In both India and Pakistan, there is obviously a need for a ^^B^^B BSUDStantial extension of the Teaching of English programme. ^^B^^B            23.  One great problem in India-representing both a challenge and an ^^B^L-W Bopportunity-is the lack of English books, and especially text books, at a price^k-W    Bwithin reach of the average Indian student. In awareness of this opportunity, them\\\m    B*ov*et Union has begun to flood India with books in English-not at the moment ^^B^^B I fltext books, but English classics, children&apos;s books and books of travel and general ^^B^^B    (knowledge.  Some at least of these books are originally produced for domestic ^^B^^B    Bpurposes in Russia and can therefore be made available very cheaply. To date these^^B    BD0 ks c ntain no direct propaganda, but if the market is once established the ^t-WwMMM    m opportunities are clearly endless.   The whole book problem demands urgent j^^J^m\M    Bexamination and solution. It may well be that the only immediate answer-limited^LmW    BDut important-is to enable the British Council to make &quot; presentations &quot; to^L-W ^?universities and other educational institutions on a much wider scale than at^k-W ^Hpresent. Consideration might also be given to organising a lending library of text^^B    B000^ on tne Lewis pattern, i.e., lending for indefinite periods with a limit on the ^^B^L\m\    (number of books borrowed. This is a problem which I propose to discuss further ^k-WMWXWM    Bwith publishers, the departments concerned and the British Council. ^^flSECRET
SECRET Wmmm\24. In the Somaliland Protectorate there would seem to be useful scope for IBritish Council activity, especially since there are admirable premises in the centre I mX^-Jof Hargeisa which the Somaliland Government would be prepared to make I ^L^M^^Hl                available.  At the moment there is no point to which the educated and English- I ^L^Mspeaking Somali can turn for books in&apos; English and for general information about 1 mX^-jBritain and her institutions. A British Council Centre, under the command of a |H^^|really competent and enthusiastic personality, might well come to play a pivotal role Iin the coming difficult years.   Nor is it entirely to be discounted that, whether | MwMjustified or not, there are feelings that Mogadishu is always several steps ahead of IHargeisa, and news that the British Council is to open in Mogadishu will probably Ifortify these feelings, with political repercussions E^Lm25. In Aden, on the other hand, virtually no progress seems to have been made I ^L^Lmin re-instituting British Council work, although an officer was appointed a year ago. I ^L^LMIt may well be that there is scope for little more than the teaching of English, and I wMmmthat the Adenese are so preoccupied with politics that they feel no urge to join in Icultural activities, especially under British auspices. But certainly there was little I ^L^LMwM-M                to suggest that a return can be expected from present efforts. On the other hand, I W-^Mit might be argued that the Representative, having at last established a Centre, I ^L^L\should be given another year in which to try to turn it to profitable use.OFFICIAL INFORMATION SERVICES26. There are well-established and relatively large British Information Offices I ^LwMin New Delhi and Karachi. There is a small office in Addis Ababa and one not yet I ^LwMfully in operation in Mogadishu. The officer recently posted to Mogadishu should I ^LwMbe given early opportunities of visiting his colleagues in neighbouring territories. I ^LwMBritish Information Services are not represented in Aden, Hargeisa and Nairobi, Iwhere the Information Services of the local Governments receive and distribute I ^LWM^L^M                United Kingdom information material. Each of these colonial information services I ^^flruns a broadcasting service for which much of the capital has been found from i mjmmcolonial development and welfare funds. I was much impressed by the efficiency Iwith which these broadcasting services were run with a minimum of resources, I ^LWM^L^m                      27.   The need for a United Kingdom Information Office in Nairobi has been | BmM^L^m                apparent for some time to the United Kingdom Government but not to the Kenya I ^LMMGovernment.   During discussions in Nairobi the useful contribution to be made I ^LWM^L^L\                by a United Kingdom Information Office, especially in helping to combat i; ^LMMpropaganda from Cairo, emerged clearly and the Governor proposed to invite I ^Lmmthe Colonial Office to set up an office. The United Kingdom Trade Commissioner I ^LMMwarmly welcomed this development and hoped that it would be possible for his H ^LWM^L^M                office and the information office to be accommodated in the same building and I WmJMpossibly to share the same services:&apos; this possibility calls for early examination. ^LwM28. Some comparisons are inevitably made between British Information H ^LWM^L^Lm                Services and the United States Information Services (U.S.I.S.), and the latter do, I Mx^mof course, command much greater resources.   On the whole, however, it seemed I ^LwMto be felt that the very size and blatancy of the American effort have undermined I ^LWMsome of its effectiveness.  U.S.I.S. has the advantage that since it includes cultural jand educational propaganda a U.S.I.S. office customarily has as its central feature I ^LWMa library of the type which on the British side is run separately by the British ICouncil.  U.S.I.S. also makes a particular point of obtaining centrally situated I W^-Mpremises with spacious shop windows on the ground floor.  In this respect British I ^LwMinformation offices compare badly and greater expenditure on such premises might I ^LWMWell be justified by results.29. In general the material and services from London received commendation, I ^L^Mbut both in India and Pakistan some feeling was evident that there was an I ^LWMinadequate understanding of their needs.  In particular the importance was urged Iof setting up in the London Press Service a section to cater for the particular needs I wMJMof Asian countries, to be headed by someone with experience in India and Iknowledge of the Indian newspapers.  There was also some criticism not only in I ^L^MIndia and Pakistan, of the quality of some of the sub-editing of London Press ^^^^HService material.  An inability to respond promptly to requests for special material Iabout &quot; locals &quot; in the United Kingdom was also reported at several posts.   Speed Bis the essence of the Press Service operation and it is hoped that teleprinters can be I ^^flput into early use where they are appropriate. wMmt

In India I was impressed by the success of a small H.M. Stationery Office HBV^^Bo. 1  (H.M.S.O.) sales section.  A great range of publications is published by H.M.S.O.HVjid ?  wid many of the titles are on &quot; know-how &quot; subjects which are of great interest in HHIHWJin H jjsian and African countries.  With only a limited effort the British Information^^Ble I Iftrvices sales section in Delhi is selling H.M.S.O. publications to the value of fBVJHWjd, m . ,000 a year and it was believed that this was capable of great expansion.  It is HVJ^^Be&apos; I&apos; me view of H.M.S.O. that this is essentially an information exercise rather than a BAV??1     |K&gt;mmercial operation and there may be some justification for this view.
