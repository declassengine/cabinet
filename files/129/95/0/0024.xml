secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1958C. (58) 22428th October, 1958CABINETEGYPT:  ASSISTANCE  FOR BRITISH  REFUGEESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will remember that on 11th July, 1957, we decided to makeex gratia loans against assets registered with the Foreign Office by British subjectswho had to leave Egypt as a result of Suez (C.C. (57) 51st Conclusions, Minute 1).The scheme was announced in both Houses of Parliament on 15th July5 1957(Hansard, House of Commons, Col. 766). The main feature was the scale of loans shown in column B of paragraph 2 (b) of the Annex to this paper. some,600 individuals have benefited at a cost of some  4 millions. In addition theAnglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board has paid out some  2 millions on relief, and rehabilitation. &quot;;2. As no settlement with Egypt has been reached, we are being pressed by representatives of the refugees to provide more assistance. On 23rd July, 1958,the Lord President stated in the House of Lords that the Government were preparedto consider a limited extension of the scheme.3. I now wish to report certain conclusions I have reached after consideringthe representations of the refugee organisations and discussing the matter with mycolleagues principally concerned; and to ask for endorsement of these conclusions.4. As I see it, we cannot buy off the claimants permanently except at therisk of prejudicing a settlement with President Nasser and at an exorbitant price,much of which would be paid to a handful of rich men. (One large family, forexample, might have to be paid about  400,000 tax free.) Our objective should therefore be to produce a scheme which should commend itself as reasonablyequitable to the taxpayer as well as the claimants and which should hold theposition for a further period. I have accordingly had prepared the proposals setout in the Annex to this paper, which will cost a further  3 millions. The schemeasked for by the refugees last year would have cost in the region of  10 millions,and by adding  3 millions to our existing  4 millions we are therefore going a goodway to meet them. My colleagues principally concerned, while feeling that theproposals do not go far enough, are prepared&quot; to endorse them at this stage. if their reception made it clear that more must be done, we might have to reconsider the position.  The main features in the proposals are:  (a) the inclusion of the business (as opposed to the private) assets of private individuals in the list of reckonable assets. This will cost about 500,000 (after allowing for the general increase in the scale);(b) an increase in the scale of payments for all except those in the lowestcategories, the majority of whom have already had 70 per cent, on thevalue of their assets as estimated by them. This may mean one hundredper cent, of their real value, as claims have certainly been inflated.Many of them will in any event benefit from other concessions. At the top of the scale payment will be increased from  5,000 to  10,000. Thiswill mean that, for example, the family I mentioned will collect anadditional  80,000 on top of the  80,000 they have had already.Increases between the bottom and top end are roughly proportionate.The cost will be about  1-8 millions excluding the business assetsconcession.Copy No.* .&apos; I :    * )54243
(c) Other minor but important concessions are proposed at a cost of about 700,000, including in particular a payment of  100,000 to the officialsdismissed in 1951, the payment of loans in some cases where assetswere registered late ( 300,000), and the adjustment of loans in caseswhere individuals paid their own fares to the United Kingdom( 200,000).5. If ray colleagues endorse this scheme, it should be announced at a suitableearly date in the House of Lords by the Lord President and in the House ofCommons by a Home Office Minister. The refugee organisations have asked to be consulted before an announcement is made but I see no advantage in this,especially as they could not all be consulted together and there would be serious danger of a leakage.6. I recommend my colleagues to approve the introduction of the scheme asset out in the Annex, at a cost of some  3 millions.EXTENSION OF THE EX GRATIA LOANS SCHEME FOR refugees from EGYPTThese proposals are based on discussions which have taken place at theTreasury with representatives of the British Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, theAnglo-Egyptian Aid Society, the Jewish Refugees&apos; Committee, the MalteseCommunities in Egypt and the Association of (Former) British Officials of theEgyptian Government.2. The two points which were urged most strongly and generally were thatthe scheme should be extended to cover assets in private businesses and that thegeneral scale of ex gratia loans should be increased, particularly in the higherbrackets.  We propose to meet these points as follows:  (a) Business AssetsProvided that an individual is in other respects eligible for an ex gratialoan, his tangible business assets will be reckonable for this purpose.Assets reckonable will be LandBuildingsOffice FurnitureVehiclesBank Balances, Cash Deposits and SecuritiesPublic Utility DepositsPlant and MachineryStock in Trade.A notional division of the assets will be made in cases of partnershipsin accordance with the shares held by different partners.(b) Scale of LoansThe scale of loans will be revised thus:  D.

3.   Other MattersA. Inclusion of certain categories of persons at present outside the scheme(a) Those who did not register their assets with the Foreign Office before15th July, 1957We propose to agree in principle, but there must be some safeguardfor the Exchequer. Where an application for a loan has been made,the applicant will be asked to submit a sworn affidavit concerning thecircumstances of the late declaration. Cases will then he considered ontheir merits. Registrations will not, however, be accepted after asuitable date (probably the date of announcement of the new scheme)as qualifying for loans, though in very exceptional circumstances, forinstance in the case of persons only now leaving Egypt, allowances maybe made.(b) Non-refugees resident in the United KingdomThese people are already eligible for ex-gratia loans subject to a test of hardship applied by the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board. Itis not proposed to open the door wider and allow automatic eligibility for them since they have not had to give up their homes in Egypt andentire way of life as have the refugees.(c) Non-Refugees Resident AbroadThis class has hitherto been outside the scope of the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board. It is, however, now agreed that theyshould benefit from the ex gratia loans scheme on the same terms asnon-refugees in the United Kingdom. Hardship will be.assessed by theAnglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board on the basis of consular reportsor sworn affidavits.id) Former British Officials of the Egyptian GovernmentThe claims of this class of persons, against the Egyptian Governmenthave the support of Her Majesty&apos;s Government. They have now beenlooked at again from the point of view of inclusion in the loans scheme.It is still felt, however, that these claims cannot be regarded as&quot; tangible &quot; assets for the purposes of the scheme. Claims for generaldamages for breach of contract or other wrong are not reckonable inthe case of the 1956 refugees the &quot; indemnities &quot; for loss of employment which are reckonable are clearly ascertained amounts. In so far asthe officials dismissed in 1951 have assets which are reckonable underthe ex gratia loans scheme, they are eligible for loans on the same terms as other British subjects. It is, however, proposed to make  100,000available to this group under a special scheme.B. Inclusion of Certain Categories of Assets at Present Outside the Scheme(a) Money Spent on FaresThose who paid their own fares to the United Kingdom are at a disadvantage compared with those whose fares were paid by the Swissin return for an undertaking to repay, since refugees in the lattercategory have equivalently more assets left in Egypt against which to claim loans. It is proposed to rectify this anomaly by making an adjustment to the ex gratia loan in cases where an individual has paidhis own fare.(b) Mortgaged PropertyThis property will in future reckon up to its net value after takingthe mortgage into account.(c) Mortgage LoansThese will in future be included in the scheme.(d) Life InsurancesThese will not be included. The only guide to their value wouldbe the surrender value which in many cases would be difficult toascertain. In many cases also the policies may have been assigned orused as securities for loans. .
(e) Assets Damaged by British Military AuthoritiesIf property suffered damage at the hands of British Forces in thePort Said operation, it will not be excluded from the loans scheme onthat account. Claims will be met ad hoc and no announcement of ageneral concession will be made as it would prejudice an importantprinciple.(/) Assets in Egypt of Deceased British PersonsWhere death occurred in Egypt, and provided that the Britishbeneficiaries are refugees, loans are granted on production of the Willand Egyptian Probate or letters of Administration. In the absence ofthese documents there is no clear title. Loans are also made to non-refugee widows on production of Will and Egyptian Probate orletters of Administration, provided they prove hardship. In future therestriction of loans to widows will not apply, all cases being looked aton their merits.Where death occurred in the United Kingdom, widows alone are paid on production of Will and Probate taken out in this country (witha test of hardship if the widows are not refugees). Here again in future the restriction of loans to widows will not apply, all cases being looked at on their merits.(g) Assets Subject to Formal Bills of SaleThese will not be included because there is no title.(h) Property Tied up in TrustsLegal advice is being taken on these cases.
