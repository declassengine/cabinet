secret this document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1958C. (58) 211 Copy No.21st October, 1958CABINET vECONOMIC situation memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 3rd October the Cabinet asked that a memorandum should be prepared onthe current position and forward prospects of the economy, for considerationinitially by the Economic Policy Committee (C.C. (58) 74th Conclusions, Minute 3).I now attach a note by officials. The Committee is still considering the questionbut my colleagues will perhaps wish to have an interim report.2. The objectives of our economic policy over the past twelve months havebeen first, to restore confidence in sterling and build up the gold and dollar reserves;secondly to establish price stability at home; and thirdly to maintain a high levelof employment.3. The first and second of these objectives have been achieved for the timebeing at any rate, but some of my colleagues feel that there is a risk that unemployment, at 476,000 (2-2 per cent.) in September, may rise by the earlyspring to as much as 750,000 (or over 3 per cent.). Although this, if it occurred,might not be unduly alarming economically in view of the economy&apos;s underlyingstrength, it would be embarrassing politically at a time when it is important to consolidate the Governments position.4. Following the deflationary measures taken by the Government last year,which have been so successful in restoring our external position, there has beena gradual decline in production and a growth in unemployment; these trends arelikely to continue-though probably less strongly at any rate for some months.We examined the situation last July and as a result the following actions were takento set the economy moving forward again:  id) Reduction of bank-rate from 7 per cent, to 4^ per cent.(b) Removal of limit on bank advances and easing of capital issues control.(c) Increase in initial allowances.id) Easing of hire-purchase restrictions.(e) Help for high-unemployment areas.(/) Special extra public investment and related expenditure of  30 millions,predominantly for spending this winter.(g) Increase of aggregate public investment of  75 millions in 1959-60 over1958-59, with subsequent annual increases of  75 millions.(/?) New Government-to-Government loans to the Commonwealth to financeour exports (agreed, or advanced stage of negotiation up to  50 millions and India will need more).5. Most of these measures take time to act on the economy, and the economic policy Committee accept that the forces which are currently depressing the economy54208B
are temporary and limited and that powerful expanding forces are gathering their strength. Among these are (a) The impetus to world recovery, following the rapid upturn in the UnitedStates.(b) The delayed effect, in the private sector, of the removal of credit controlsthis summer, and lower interest rates, coupled with such stimuli as our home-ownership programme.(c) The big planned growth of public sector investment (and the continuinggrowth of Government and local authorities&apos; current expenditure).The key question is when will the upturn come, and what, if anything, can andshould be done in the interim.6. We have concluded that what is required to meet the present situation is essentially a further operation to take up some of the existing slack in industry,and in particular in the capital goods industries, and to reduce unemployment inthe areas where it is relatively heavier, until the expanding forces to which I have referred develop their full effect. What we have in mind is that, if we can findsuitable projects, expenditure in the public sector of the investment programmemight be increased in the remainder of this financial year and in the first half ofthe next financial year. I am however anxious that, so far as such projects would increase above-the-line expenditure next year, we should not pursue them to theextent which would materially alter such prospects of tax remission as there might otherwise be next spring. We are also alive to the danger of taking any action nowwhich might lead to an overloading of the economy in 1960 and 1961 when the call on our resources will, according to present assessments, be very strong.7. We have therefore concluded that any measures taken now should as faras possible satisfy three conditions. These are as follows:  (a) They must be quickly effective upon the economy but must not be effective for longer than one year.(b) They should as far as possible take the form of bringing forward schemesthat would otherwise be carried out in 1960-61.(c) They should consist of jobs whose labour content is high and should bedirected towards areas or sectors of industry where unemployment is relatively heavier.8. I have arranged to put in hand as a matter of urgency an examination ofwhat could be done on this basis, and the Economic Policy Committee will meet again to discuss the results as soon as this information is available. I hope that,in addition to agreeing the enlarged programme for 1959-60, we will at the sametime be able to settle the individual allocations inside the total of  1,575 millions which we have provisionally agreed for 1960-61. I will then report to mycolleagues again.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,20th October, 1958.
AnnexECONOMIC SITUATION AND PROSPECTSNote by OfficialsThis note analyses recent trends in the economy and the course which the economy is likely to follow, on the basis of present policies, up to the first half of next year.A. Recent Trends2. Over the last twelve months production has been decreasing slightly,unemployment has been rising, prices have been relatively stable, and the externalposition has been greatly strengthened.3. Industrial production has fallen since the spring. At the most recent date for which information is available, it was running some 3 per cent, and 4 per cent,below the level of last year. Total national output has also fallen but not sosharply, since the &quot; distribution and services &quot; sector has continued to expand.In the second quarter of this year it appears to have been some 2 per cent, belowthe corresponding quarter of 1957.4. The incidence of the fall in production on particular industries has beenpatchy. Production of steel has fallen very substantially and so has the output of textiles. Production of passenger cars on the other hand rose sharply last winter and this level has been maintained. Coal production fell earlier in the year, butmuch less sharply than did steel, and there has recently been some recovery. rail traffic continues to run well below last year&apos;s level.5. Given the rate of investment in private industry over the last few years,the economy as a whole must be working well within its capacity. But it is difficultto assess this quantitatively. The figure of 20 per cent, for the degree of under-capacity working in the engineering and allied industries, which wassuggested by a recent private enquiry, has been widely quoted. While there iscertainly surplus capacity in these industries, this figure equally certainly greatlyexaggerates the increase in the output of these industries which could be secured in practice, even if an increase in demand of this order could be secured withoutat the same time creating excessive demand on other industries.6. The underlying trend of unemployment has been upwards since the autumn of last year. After allowance for seasonal factors, unemployment rose by anaverage of about 25,000 a month between November and May. Since then theincrease has been fluctuating round an average of 10,000 a month. Thenon-seasonal increase of 28,000 between August and September, which brought the total figure up to 476,000 (2-2 per cent.), was affected by the incidence of holidays on the number registered as temporarily stopped and by the fact that thelarger number of school leavers this year are taking longer to obtain employment.7. After falling steadily since last October there was no change in unfilledvacancies, seasonally adjusted, between July and August, and between then and september there was a rise of 12,000. It is too early, though, to assume that the downward trend has been reversed. The number of workers on short time rose from 35,000 last September to 217,000 in May, since when there has been a reduction to 160,000 in August. There has also been a reduction in overtime working. Thenumber of workers on overtime at the end of August 1,196,000 was 338,000(22 per cent.) less than a year ago.8. Prices have increased less this year than at any time in the recent past.The index of retail prices at the latest available date was some 2 per cent, above thelevel a year earlier. The wage round is not yet complete, but it seems likely thatthe average increase granted will be in the neighbourhood of 4 per cent., and the timing of the round has been considerably delayed. Further, it seems likely thatfor the time being average earnings are not rising appreciably faster than standard54208
wage-rates. This is a better result than in earlier years, but the increase in wagesstill exceeds any rate of growth of productivity which we can expect in mormal times.9. The gold and dollar reserves have risen by some  450 millions during thelast twelve months, and overseas sterling holdings have fallen by about  140millions. Two-fifths of this improvement is, however, the result of special factors: 90 millions was borrowed from the Export-Import Bank,  60 millions service onthe North American loans was deferred,  40 millions was received in a Shell capitaltransaction, and acceptances outstanding have fallen by about  50 millions. Theloan from the Export-Import Bank (and the  200 millions drawn from theInternational Monetary Fund in 1956) will be due for repayment in the next fewyears. But the underlying balance of payments position on current account hasbeen very strong. The surplus for the first half year amounted to  330 millions;a surplus of about half that amount is forecast for the second half of this year.B. Underlying CausesDemand and Production10.&quot; Production has fallen because of the fall in demand for our exports, areduction in the rate of stock building, and a substantial fall in the volume of public authorities&apos; current expenditure on goods and services, reflecting mainly therundown in defence manpower.^ These deflationary forces have been in partoffset by higher fixed investment expenditure and a substantial rise in personal consumption. In public sector investment, there has been a steady reduction in local authority housing, but other public investment has risen, and the total is up onlast year. In the private sector, capital expenditure in manufacturing industry has fallen slightly, but there has been a big increase in investment in the distributiveand commercial sector. Consumers benefited from lower import prices, whichlimited the rise in retail prices so that this did not swallow up all the increase in money incomes, and from the increase in social security benefits which came intoeffect from February.11. As regards particular industries, the large fall in steel production appearsto have been due very largely to lower exports and de-stocking by steel users, andnot to a fall in usage of steel. Stock figures are available only up to the end of June,and production has fallen steeply since then though the September figure showssome recovery. It seems that the main cause has continued to be de-stocking. Thefall in coal production, which has recently been reversed, has been broadly in line with the fall in production generally and the long-term trend towards other fuels.Textile production has been hit by de-stocking by distributors, falling exports, andthe fact that the increase in consumers&apos; expenditure has been concentrated ondurable goods. This concentration, together with high investment in vehicles by the distributive and commercial sector and high exports, accounts for the buoyantconditions in the motor car industry.Unemployment12. The fall in production resulted in a fall in total employment. At the endof August the number in civil employment was 209,000 (0-9 per cent.) less than twelve months before (this was wholly due to a fall in employment in manufacturing industries, changes in other industries cancelling each other out) and the armed forces were smaller by 78,000 (11 per cent.). But 136,000 left the working population so that the increase in the number registered as wholly unemployed was151,000. The underlying trend in civil employment has been downwards since september last year, though in recent months the rate of decrease has tended to be rather less.Prices and Wages13. Retail prices have been fairly stable over the last twelve months becauseof the fall in import prices. This fall, not all of which has been reflected in finalprices, has already been sufficient largely to offset the effects of the Rent Act, of* Total Government current expenditure has risen in spite of this, because of pay increases, otherprice-rises and the increase in social security benefits.
substantial increases in local rates, and of last year&apos;s increase in wage costs. the improved outcome on the wages front must be largely attributed to the psychologicaleffects of the stand which the Government has taken during the last twelve months and the downturn in production.The External Position14. There have been two major factors in the great improvement in the external position. The first is the recovery in confidence in sterling, both at homeand abroad, resulting from the Governments evident determination to give priority to the strength of sterling. The second is the fall in import prices, until recentlyunaccompanied by any fall in our sales to primary producers, which has greatly strengthened our current account. In addition, we have to some extent been livingon stocks of imports, and this has reduced our import bill still further.C. Future Prospects15. We have tried to form a view on how the economy will move between now and the spring of next year, on the basis of present policies. The uncertaintiesare substantial, and not all in one direction. We have avoided constant reiterationof this caution; but it should not be forgotten. We first give our conclusions, andthen the reasoning which leads to them.(a) The index of industrial production (seasonally corrected) may fall to about132 compared with the recent level of 135; between September 1957 and july of this year it fell from 140 to 135. The fall in total national production (the Gross National Product) will be substantially less, since there are few deflationary forces operating in the non-industrial sector of the economy. The Gross National Product in the first half of nextyear may be about 1^ per cent, lower than in the first half of this year.(b) Between now and the spring, the underlying trend of unemployment willcontinue to be upward, though at a considerably lower rate than weexperienced between October 1957 and April of this year. Togetherwith seasonal factors it is expected to carry, the figure by January next to 600,000 (2-8 per cent.). Thereafter seasonal influences will be favourable and may be sufficient to offset the underlying rise.(c) We shall continue to earn a good balance of payments surplus, though notat the exceptional level of the first six months of this year; and, in theabsence of any adverse confidence factors, we shall add to the reserves,though again not at the rate of the recent past, and shall continue tostrengthen our external financial position.16. The world background is an important factor in assessing our ownprospects. The United States is recovering fast from the recession, which reached its lowest point in May. But growth has slackened in Western Europe. There hasbeen some recovery in the prices of primary products, but it is unlikely that therewill be any general substantial rise above present levels. The effects of the measuresto cut imports, which primary producing countries have been compelled to adopt,are now being felt and will continue to be felt through the first half of next year.17. It is next important to consider the changes in domestic policies whichhave already been made during the course of the summer, the effects of which willbe felt increasingly during the months to come:  (a) Monetary Relaxations(i) Bank rate has been reduced in successive steps from 7 per cent, atthis time last year to 4\ per cent.(ii) The Capital Issues Committee has been instructed to adopt a more liberal attitude towards applications.(iii) The banks have been freed from their undertaking to restrict thelevel of advances, and most of them have introduced PersonalLoans schemes. Advances of all kinds have since risen sharply.This may have a considerable effect on consumption.(iv) Relaxations in hire-purchase terms became effective in the middleof September. These are likely to have a very substantial effecton consumer expenditure during the next six months or so:there is already some indication of this.
(b) Public investment the programme for 1959-60, already approved by Ministers,provides for an increase of  75 millions over the aggregate programme for 1958-59. In addition, special expenditure of  30 millions,predominantly for 1958-59, was authorised in July. It is difficult to beprecise about the timing of the increase in expenditure, but it seems probable that public investment as a whole will be running nearly 50 millions higher in the first half of 1959 than in the first half of thecurrent year.(c) Development Areas, &amp;c.A number of measures have been taken to assist the areas oflocally concentrated unemployment.(d) Lending Abroad sOffers of credit to Commonwealth Governments under Section 3of the Export Guarantees Act, have already been made up to a totalof  50 millions. The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in montreal that further Government finance would be available forlonger term development purposes. These credits will help to sustainour exports.(e) The Exchequer PositionSeveral of the measures so far mentioned will affect the Exchequerposition.  In addition:(i) the nationalised industries, particularly transport and coal, are running rising deficits;(ii) although Government expenditure this year appears to be keepingclose to the Estimates there are big increases in prospect for next year;(iii) the initial allowances for investment expenditure were increased byone-half in the last budget.These are all expansionary influences as far as aggregate&quot; levels of demand and activity are concerned.We have made allowance for these relaxations in making our assessment of demand.Demand and Production18. A continued fall in exports must be expected for some time, owing tothe impact of lower prices on the incomes of primary producers. In the longer termthere will be forces working for an improvement in exports: but we do not knowwhen the recovery will come. The sustaining effects on personal consumptionof lower import prices is now exhausting itself, but the relaxations on consumercredit and monetary conditions generally should provide a sufficient stimulus tokeep consumption rising. Within the total of fixed investment, a continuing fall in investment by manufacturing industry is forecast for the coming months, but thiswill be counter-balanced by the strong growth of public investment. We expecta big rise in public authorities&apos; current expenditure on goods and services.19. The biggest uncertainty is the rate of stock building. Investment inadding to stocks, though still substantial, has recently been much lower than itwas last year, and this has been one of the main deflationary factors in the situation.We have thought it prudent to assume that this deflationary factor would continueto operate. But there are big uncertainties in either direction.20. We conclude, therefore, that the recent decline in output is likely tocontinue at about the same rate; a fall of perhaps 1-J per cent, in Gross national product between the first half of this year and the first half of next; and a rathersharper fall in industrial production from a level of 135 this summer to perhaps132 in the first half of next year. There is a big uncertainty on account of theunpredictable influence of changes in stock building.Unemployment21. Since the fall in employment over the last year has been broadly in line with the fall in output, our conclusions about the continued fall in output suggests
that employment will continue to fall at about the same rate. Some of those wholose their jobs will continue to leave the labour force, so that the rate of increaseof unemployment is likely to be unchanged also. Over the past five months thegrowth in wholly unemployed has averaged about 10,000 per month, aftercorrection for seasonal influences; this compares with an average of 25,000 per month from October to April last year. A continued increase at 10,000 per monthwould take registered unemployment to 600,000 (2-8 per cent.) by January of nextyear, when seasonal unemployment is at its height. Thereafter, the fall in seasonalunemployment might be sufficient to offset the underlying increase, and indeedthere could be even a slight fall in the spring. But, of course, the month-to-monthmovements are bound to be irregular.Prices22. Any predictions could be falsified by abnormal changes in the prices ofa number of foods, whose prices are subject to large short-term variations; as, forinstance, if there were a repetition of the potato shortage which pushed up theindex so high in the spring of this year. Subject to this qualification, there seemsa good prospect that any further rise in retail prices will be small.External Prospects23. The balance of payments is expected to be satisfactory throughout thisperiod. The marked decline in exports referred to in paragraph 20 will eliminate the quite exceptional surplus on visible trade achieved in the first half of this year;but the volume of imports is expected to continue at the present low level, import prices are also forecast to remain depressed, and the surplus on invisible transactionsis expected to go on rising, largely because of oil earnings. We forecast a currentsurplus in the first half of 1959 of about  200 millions, compared with  334 millions in the first half of 1958 and rather less than  200 millions forecast for the second half of 1958.24. This forecast surplus of  200 millions in the first half of 1959 should besufficient to cover our capital outflow and leave some margin for increasing the reserves. The outflow of private capital, of which oil investment is the chiefcomponent, might be put at about  100 millions in the first half of 1959. Inaddition we must &quot;expect some increase in the outflow of long-term capital on government account, because of special assistance promised to India and other commonwealth countries. Hence the surplus on current and long-termtransactions may be of the order of  80 millions. As a result of various otheradjustments, affecting the rest of the sterling area&apos;s position and miscellaneouscapital movements, the reserves may rise by some  100 millions in the first half of next year, and our sterling liabilities fall by about  30 millions (apart from any confidence factors).25. In order to view our external position in its true light, it is necessary toTemember (a) that the present level of reserves,  1,114 millions, still too low inrelation to our commitments and liabilities, includes  290 millions of moneyborrowed on short term; (b) that a substantial part of the current surplus we are atpresent running results from abnormally low import prices and a depressed levelof activity at home, and so will be reversed with recovery; and (c) that our commitments to lend abroad to Commonwealth countries are increasing. the implication is that while the balance of payments is now strong and likely tocontinue so, and should be able to take the strain of a moderate growth of home demand, it is not nearly strong enough to sustain a very rapid expansion of activity.October, 1958.
