CONFIDENTIAL(THIfl DOCUMENT IS THE property  OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)iC.(58) 210 COPY NO.^18th October, 1958CABINETFAROESE FISHERY LIMITSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food we should like to report the position reached in the disc ssionsat Ministerial level with the Danes about the revision of the 1955 agreement which conceded exclusive fishing for the Faroese in certain areas outsidethe three-mile limit.   We have been assisted by the Attorney-General andthe Foreign   Office.2.       We have offered a revision of the 1955 Agreement to bring it into conformity with the United States&apos; proposal, made at the Geneva Conferenceon the Law of the Sea, which the United Kingdom supported.    This wouldgive the Faroese an exclusive fishing zone stretching approximatelysix miles from the coast.   Where the 1955 Agreement line went beyond sixmiles that line would be retained.   There would be a confidential understandingthat trawling and seine-netting (saving the very few existing Faroese seiners)would be prohibited within this zone.   Between six miles and twelve miles,foreign fishing would be limited to nations enjoying historic rights, of whichthe United Kingdom is one.3.       The Danes have also asked that there should be special non-exclusivezones for line-fishing (trawling and seining being prohibited) between the six and twelve-mile lines.   The three zones they propose are shown,together with the proposed six-mile and twelve-mile lines, on the map at annex A.4.       The new Agreement would endure until the entry into force of aConvention regulating the breadth of territorial waters and fishery limits(this looks forward to the proposed Second World Conference on the law of the Sea) or for three years, whichever is the shorter period.   W   should likethe Agreement to be a multilateral one between all the countries fishing atthe Faroes.   The Danes wish to have a fresh bilateral agreement with usto which the would invite the assent of the other countries concerned.5.       The present state of the negotiations is:(i) The six-mile line has been virtually agreed with the Danes andour fishing industry is content with it.(ii)  We want the twelve-mile line to be drawn from low-water mark.The Danes have not yet accepted this.(iii) We have to reach agreement over the areas to be reserved forline-fishing and the seasons of the year for which they areto be reserved.
CONFIDENTIAL(iv) If the Agreement is to be bilateral, we have to ensure that othercountries do assent before it enters into force.   We think this would be a not unreasonable arrangement.(v) The Danes wish to reserve the right to demand the revisionof the Agreement if Her Majesty&apos;s Government should recognise in respect of Iceland any more favourablearrangement;  we think we could accept this provided it does not extend to any interim measures prescribed by the International Court if the dispute were referred there.s6.       The 3ritish fishing industry are strongly opposed to any reservedareasfor line-fishing being conceded if there should be any possibilityof the premature reopening of the Agreement.    They might acquiesce in two line-fishing zones on a sufficiently restricted basis if the agreement were satisfactory in other respects.   We think we should be able to getthe Danes to accept two zones instead of three.7.       We propose to limit our offer to the Danes to:-(a) exclusive fishing within the six-mile line, butpreservation of historic fishing rights between six and twelve miles as proposed in paragaph 2;(b) the drawing of the twelve-mile line from low-water mark;(c) the concession of two areas on a restricted basis for line-fishing between six and twelve miles;(d) a bilateral agreement subject to the assent of other countries and to British fishermen being no worse off than theirs.8. After a further round of discussions at official level we hope thatthe time will be ripe for a last round of Ministerial negotiation. We will consult our colleagues further as may be necessary.J.M.I .H.17th October, 1958
