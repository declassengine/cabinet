AnnexNIGERIAThe Nigerian Constitutional Conference has now been in progress for threeweeks. We aim to finish on Monday, October 27th.2. The Conference has gone reasonably well so far. Satisfactory agreement was reached in the first week on the major question of the Police. The principle ofa single force under the ultimate control of the Federal Government has beenaccepted under arrangements which will give Regional Governments a reasonablesay in establishment, administration and day-to-day operational use. Safeguardsare provided against improper political interference in Police matters. agreement was also reached with relatively little difficulty onvthe important matter of revenueallocation. The recommendations of the Fiscal Commission headed by Sir JeremyRaisman were accepted as they stood. We have agreed on the detailed arrangementsfor Northern Region Self-Government which will come into force on 15th March,1959. We have reached agreement on a list of fundamental human rights whichare to be entrenched in the Constitution. Their basic purpose is to protect the rightsof the citizen against the State, but satisfactory provisions are to be included whichshould enable the State to deal with emergencies and subversive activities. We have dealt successfully with a wide range of lesser problems.3. Discussions on such matters as the judiciary, electoral arrangements andthe Public Service reflect a keen desire on all sides to ensure that these institutionsare kept out of politics. I have been encouraged by the evidence that the northern region is ready to make a number of important reforms in its legal system whichshould bring the administration of justice more into line with modern ideas.4. All this is very satisfactory, the more so since it has been apparent thatthere are still bitter and deep-rooted divisions, fears..and suspicions among thedifferent races and political groupings. These fears are of course in themselves the driving force behind the desire for a carefully worked out and detailedConstitution, the main principles of which will only be alterable with difficulty.5. It is unlikely that the Conference will succeed in allaying the fears ofthe minority groups. I have a great deal of sympathy for the minority view butI can see no other solution than to endeavour to construct a Constitution whichwill provide a reasonable chance of fair treatment for all. Of greater importance,however, is the major conflict between the predominantly Western Region ActionGroup and the Northern People&apos;s Congress, the major party of the North. It is apparent that for the time being at least the National Council of Nigeria and the cameroons which forms the Eastern Region Government under Dr. Azikiwe islining up with the North. Consequently Chief Awolowo, the Action Group leader,has every reason to fear that on independence the West may be faced with a North-East alliance. Partly, if not mainly, for this reason he has pressed with great vigourfor his major objective the weakening of the North by the creation of a MiddleBelt State and for changes in the Northern system of government. In so doinghe has aroused bitter opposition from the North and the Conference has at times(as I predicted) been a stormy one. At no time has the hostility been directed at Her Majesty&apos;s Government.6. The major question before the Conference has been whether the federation should be broken up into more than the present three Regions. This remains atpresent unsettled. After over a week&apos;s debate I have told them that there can beno question of new states being created before independence, if independence isto come by 1960. I have proposed, however, that it should be recognised that thepresent regional structure is not necessarily immutable and that provision shouldbe made in the Constitution for an orderly (but lengthy and difficult) procedureenabling the changing of regional boundaries and the creation of new states. my proposals are still being considered by the Conference but I think that it is likely that something on the lines I have suggested will in the end be accepted.7. This brings me to the question of the date of independence. At the publicopening session all the leaders repeated in clear terms their request for independence within the Commonwealth by 2nd April, 1960. Since then there have been passingreferences to the question but they have been content to get down to discussion of
the detailed problems requiring settlement without demanding that I agree to thedate ab initio. In private talks with the Federal Prime Minister and the others ithas been made clear to me that the date 2nd April, 1960 is only advanced forbargaining purposes and that a date in the autumn of 1960 will in fact be acceptable.I have of course had doubts whether if a free choice were open to us Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be right to contemplate relinquishing control even by the endof 1960. It is clear that there are great and probably irreconcilable differences between the major groups and peoples. If the West continues to provoke the Northand if Chief Awolowo were, as he hopes, to win power at the Centre at the end of1959, the threat of an ultimate break-away by the North may become real. I wouldcertainly not like to assert that self-government will in Nigeria be good government.There is a heavy responsibility on us therefore in taking a decision committing usto a definite date for Nigerian independence as much as two years ahead. I havegiven this matter very careful thought and have come to the conclusion that weshould gain nothing by postponing a decision. All the parties in Nigeria are nowfirmly committed in public to securing at this Conference Her Majesty&apos;governments agreement to a firm date. Relations between this country and nigeria could not be better than they are at the present time. To refuse the requestwould undoubtedly create an atmosphere of bitterness and distrust which would prejudice our future relations with an independent Nigeria and even if we wereto refuse the request now we still could not delay independence for much longer.We would only have succeeded in giving the at present divided groups a commontarget the United Kingdom for political odium. To continue to govern adiscontented and possibly rebellious Nigeria would also present wellnigh insolubleadministrative problems in view of the transfer of effective power that has already taken place in the domestic field.  It might even need substantial military forces.8. I have, in accordance with the request of my colleagues at our last discussion, pursued the question of a Defence Agreement with the Minister ofDefence. We have agreed on the list of facilities that we would want from Nigeriaafter independence and I have discussed with the Nigerian Prime Minister andthe Premiers the proposal that there should be a Defence Agreement between our two countries. They welcome the idea in principle and are agreeable to ourworking out the details before independence with a view to having the agreementcome into force at that time. The Minister of Defence and I propose to discussthe details further with the Nigerian Ministers during this week so that we can besure that we shall get what we need before I make any statement about the dateof independence. The proposed agreement will of course involve us in obligations toNigeria. These are being examined in consultation with the Departments concernedbut I believe that they will be such that this country must be prepared to accept if,on independence, Nigeria is to remain firmly inside the Western orbit.9. I now invite my colleagues to agree that, provided the Conference is ableto reach agreement on the outstanding questions and the Minister of defence and I secure satisfactory detailed undertakings about Defence, I should inform them that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to grant independence toNigeria in the autumn of 1960. I envisage that the date will be some time inOctober but I would need to fix the exact date in consultation with the Nigerianleaders.A. L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.1,20th October, 1958.
