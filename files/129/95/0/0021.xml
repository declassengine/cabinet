(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 221 COPY NO.23rd October, 1958CABINETARMED FORCES; FAMILY pensions memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer as the Minister of Defence says in his paper (C.(58) 219), I accept the scale of benefits proposed by the Grigg Committee for Forces&apos;family pensions, but I am strongly opposed to the Committee&apos;s view -endorsed by the Minister of Defence and the Service Ministers - that thepresent non-contributory basis should be maintained.2.        This would be in direct conflict with the general policy that provision for old age should be on a contributory basis and with the factthat all other Crown servants (and public servants generally) with familypension schemes are required to contribute to them.   In my view the armed Forces should now be brought into line.   Indeed the 1956 white paper on Service Pay and Pensions (Cmd. 9692) contained the definitestatement that &quot;any future revision in their family pensions will be ona contributory basis&quot;.3.        Apart from the political difficulty of going back on this and apartfrom the principle involved, there will be serious repercussions in otherparts of the public service if the Forces&apos; scheme stays non-contributory.There is great discontent among the teachers, who have refused theintroduction of a dependants&apos; pension scheme, because of its contributory basis.   If the Forces get their improved scheme on a non-contributory basis, the teachers will start a vigorous campaign to get a more favourablesettlement.   This would be very costly and the cost would be further increased when the concession to the teachers in turn led to similar concessions in the National Health Service and Local Governmentdependants&apos; pension   schemes.4.        For these reasons I ask my colleagues to agree that Forces1family pensions should now be brought on to the contributory basis.   i recognise that it will not be easy to apply this principle to the Forces,but the practical and actuarial difficulties involved are different only indegree from those which have been successfully overcome in other partsof the public service and nationalised industry.   Indeed, certain schemes,such as those for policemen and firemen, which recognise unusuallyrigorous conditions and short careers, are definite pointers to what canbe done in circumstances not intrinsically unlike those of the Forces.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.22nd October, 1958
