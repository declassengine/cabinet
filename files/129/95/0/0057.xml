Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1958C. (58) 257 Copy No.18th December, 1958CABINETTHE AIRCRAFT industry memorandum by the Minister of supply in C. (57) 155, on the industrial consequences of the 1957 Defence White Paper,I stated that the outlook for considerable sections of the aircraft industry seemedbleak; that employment in the industry between 1957 and 1961-62 might declinefrom 266,000 to 150,000; and that the Cabinet might at an appropriate momentwish for a further report on the industry. In the light of the widespread concernat present being expressed about the industry&apos;s future I consider that my colleagues should know how matters now appear.2. The decline in employment over the last twelve months has been some10,000 less than the average forecast. This may well mean that the decline tocome will exceed the estimate and may amount to another 25,000 during 1959.I have the impression that companies which have been holding on on the chance that things might turn for the better are giving up hope and will soon break up their teams.3. Some companies outside the essential core of the industry are finding it extremely difficult to survive; e.g., Scottish Aviation Limited. This, however, was inevitable, granted that the industry had become overlarge in relation to present defence requirements; and, in so far as capacity has to be eliminated, it is better that it should be that of the technically weaker firms than of the stronger.4. What is more disturbing is that, owing to the fortuitous incidence of thedefence cuts, some of the larger and technically sounder units are also confronted with a large-scale contraction, and, in some cases, with possible collapse. Theyare the Hawker Siddeley Group;the Bristol Aircraft Company, on its airframe side;Handley Page Limited; and short Brothers and Harland Limited.The last-named presents a peculiarly difficult problem in that not only is theGovernment the majority shareholder, but the company is also one of the two main industrial enterprises of Northern Ireland.5. Even in the case of companies, e.g., Vickers Armstrongs Limited andde Havilland Aircraft Company Limited, with, on the face of it, enough work forthe next five to seven years, all is not well. There are signs that Vickers&apos; forthcomingcivil project, the Vanguard, will not be a commercial success and the finances ofthe firm may as a result be rudely shaken; while de Havillands are not only heavily dependent on the Blue Streak contract, but the commercial success of the Comet IValso remains in doubt.54477THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
2SECRET6. In so far as the impending redundancies are the result of past defencedecisions, little can- now. be done to mitigate them; but there should be somerestoration of confidence when certain contracts now under discussion in theDefence Committee are placed. The contracts in question are for a Canberrareplacement, a short-range freighter and a strategic freighter. A fillip would alsobe given by a settlement of the question of financial aid for the Rotodyne, on whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and I are in negotiation.7. Lastly, I hope soon to make an announcement on the Swallow project.The cancellation of this as a result of the Defence White Paper of 1957 has drawnforth criticism from our own back benchers, on the ground that the novel ideawhich the project represented might be taken up in the United States. Mycolleagues may like to know that I am on the point of concluding an agreementwith the Americans, whereby they and we shall jointly conduct a research programme over the next 12-18 months, at the end of which, if we in this countryplace an operational requirement for the aircraft, they will probably contribute to the finances of construction here; if, on the other hand, we feel unable to place an operational requirement, the Americans will be free to construct the aircraftthemselves.The future for civil aircraft8. Whatever the palliating effects, however, of impending contracts andannouncements, the state of the industry prompts the larger question: has this industry, as things now stand, a long-term future? Is there a prospect of expansionon the civil side to offset, at any rate in part, the contraction on the military side?Or is the civil side also likely to dwindle away? I consider that if v/e are not to answer these questions pessimistically we require a more positive policy than we now have. The United States, Soviet Russia and France see in civil aircraft carriers of national prestige and influence; they therefore seek to promote civil aircraft as a deliberate matter of national policy, and in the case of the first twonamed they are aided by a large internal market. In our own case the domestic demand for civil aircraft is small and uneconomic; and it is confined to threecustomers the two airline corporations, each with differing needs, and each undera statutory obligation to pay its way and enjoying a measure of commercialautonomy, and the Transport Command of the Royal Air Force, the primary dutyof which is to serve the transport needs of the armed forces. The fact that eachseeks to serve its own individual narrow interest is extremely difficult to reconcilewith a national policy for the aircraft industry. Not only is it desirable in thesecircumstances that each customer should show an awareness of the heaviness ofits responsibility; but in addition certain main changes seem to me to be necessary.They are two.9. First, it is desirable that there should be a return, at any rate in part, tothe immediate post-war practice by which the Government encouraged thedevelopment of chosen aircraft even though, on the inception of their development,there was no home requirement. It was under this system that the Viscount wasproduced. The opposite arrangement by which development is rarely startedwithout a firm requirement encourages the customer to delay his requirement and,having delayed, to turn to an American aircraft which then happens to be comingalong. We should, as far as possible, encourage manufacturers to undertakedevelopment with their own finances; but, with the depletion of revenues fromdefence contracts, few will have the resources to do this, and some government contribution is inevitable.10. The largest project requiring development in the absence of a home demand is likely to be the supersonic civil transport. A research study to determine the economics of such an aircraft is now nearing completion. No home demand islikely to be forthcoming at the moment, the corporations having committed themselves for some time ahead. Yet a future demand, say, by .1970, is certain.Appropriate proposals will be submitted in the light of the study now being made.11. It is not only, however, in anticipation of a future home demand that development needs to be encouraged. It is sometimes the complaint of foreign airoperators, particularly of Commonwealth operators, that the British aircraft industry is over-geared to the demands of the home customers, small and
uneconomic though they are, and that these are often out of line with exportdemands. The resumption of the practice by which the Government sponsoreddevelopment in the absence of a home demand would allow of the development ofthose types considered to be exportable. Some of the companies now faced withviolent contraction have such projects, but, feeling the pinch of reduced militarycontracts, are unable alone to undertake development.12. The second main change required is in the organisation and functions ofthe home operators, viz., British Overseas Airways Corporation, British european airways and Transport Command. If it is the Governments desire that the manufacturing industry should survive, then the functions of these must be widenedto include a service to the industry. If, for instance, Transport Command were toundertake the route-proving of a new aircraft before it entered into commercialservice with the Corporations, the damaging publicity given to teething troubleswhen encountered in commercial flights would be avoided. Similarly, if the corporations were to undertake the proving of new aircraft not required by themselves but likely to prove exportable, export would be immensely facilitated.13. I suggest accordingly an investigation into the possible enlargement of the role of the operators.14. To conclude: not only is the aircraft industry suffering on the combat sidethrough the contraction of the defence budget, but it is also facing difficulties on thecivil side. Indeed the basic facts are such that there may well over the next decadebe an enforced withdrawal from the civil field and with it the virtual disappearance of an important industry. The alternative is Government assistance, e.g., with thedevelopment of aircraft for which there is as yet no home demand. While many ofthe matters raised in this memorandum are appropriate for consideration by asub-committee of the Cabinet, I consider that the Cabinet as a whole should be aware of the choice which lies before us.A.
