m    248(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 2473rd December, 1958CABINETBRITISH ALUMINIUM company memorandum by the Economic Secretary, TreasuryA Government statement about the British Aluminium Company(B .A.C.) cannot now long be delayed.   The story has been widely reported and there has been considerable Press comment.   Dealings in 3.A.C.stock have not yet been suspended, but the market situation is extremelydifficult and prices are a matter for individual negotiation.The proposals.        Therf are two sets of rival proposals, each requiring exchange control and Capital Issues consent, at present before the Treasury.   Thefirst is a proposal by B.A.C. to issue the whole of their authorised butunissued stock (4f million  1 shares) to the Aluminium Company ofAmerica (Alcoa): this would give Alcoa a one-third interest in the equityof B.A.C,  In addition, Alcoa propose to offer to buy about 1 million shareat present held by Reynolds Tube Investments Aluminium (R .T, I. A. ).This would ftive Alcoa by far the largest single holding and de factocontrol of B.A.C,  The secor..d is a proposal by Tube Investments (T.I.)to acquire the whole of the existing equity in B.A.G.: they would thentransfer their whole holding in B.A.C. to R.T.I.A., a United Kingdomcompany which they have formed jointly with Reynolds Metals Company(Reynolds), a United States company.   T.I. would hold 51 per cent of the shares and voting rights in R.T. I, A, and Reynolds the remaining49 per cent.3.        So far, Press comment has in the main been hesitant aboutcommenting on the merits of the link-up with Alcoa; those who havecommented have criticised the loss of control to an American company.Comment on the handling of the matter by the B.A.C. Board has, however,been universally hostile.   The Board have been strongly criticised fordisposing of a large block of shares without consulting existing share-holders.   The Deputy Governor of the Bank of England reports that Cityopinion dislikes the Alcoa proposal which they think has been very badlyhandled by the B.A.C. Board.   The Board of Trade Solicitor has, however,advised that the B.A.C. Board probably could not be challenged for any breach of duty, because the B.A.C, Board have publicly stated that theyare convinced that the Alcoa transaction would be in the best interestsof the company.COPY NO..J2
4.        On the merits of the two proposals:-The Alcoa Proposal(i)   There would be an issue of  4jr millions ordinary sharesto Alcoa ( if millions immediately and the rest over three years) at aprice of 60s. a share.(ii) Alcoa would be a somewhat stronger associate   finaneiallythan Reynolds;  in addition to the subscription for new shares the link with Alcoa should provide B.A.C. with access to substantial capital resources.(iii) The Board of B.A.C. judge that an association with Alcoawould be in the better interests of their Company.(iv) The reserves would receive an inward remittance of5L4j millions immediately, and a further  9 millions over the next threeyears.(v) The acquisition of about 40 per cent of the equity (i. e.33^ per cent from the new issue and the rest from R.T.I.A.) would giveAlcoa the major influence in the Company,s affairs, in view of the widespread of the remaining shareholding.   Some of this, too, would be in american hands.   Alcoa  have publicly stated that it had no desire orintention of acquiring control of B.A.C. and it still has no such desireor intention^  Nevertheless it would always be open to them to acquirelegal control as well by buying stock on the Stock Exchange, which wouldnot require Treasury consent.R,T.1.A. Proposal(i)   T,I, are proposing to acquire the whole of equity of B.A.C.at a price of approximately 78s. a share, by offering B.A.C. shareholdersone T.l. share (at approximately 78s. per share) and 78s. in cash forevery two B.A.C. shares.(ii)  Reynolds,too, are in a strong financial position; although their purchase of shares will not bring any new capital to B.A.C., theirassociation with B.A.C. will provide the latter with access to substantialcapital resources.   T.I. have given an assurance in writing that thecapital necessary for present and future development will be forthcoming from them in association with Reynolds.(iii) A link with R.T.I.A. would meet with the opposition of thepresent Board of B.A.C,(iv) The reserves would receive an immediate accrual of about 15-j millions (i, e. the net amount Reynolds would have to pay for49 per cent of the B.A.C. shares acquired by R.T.I.A. from T.I. at78s.).(v) Control of B.A.C. would remain in the United Kingdom sinceT.I. have a majority of both the equity and the voting powers in R.T.I.A.Reynolds and T.l. have agreed that the method of further financing willbe such as to retain control in the United Kingdom of B.A.C. and itssubsidiary companies (including its Canadian interests).-2-
The strategic argument5.        It may be argued that, for strategic reasons, we should not allow control of this Company to pass out of United Kingdom hands.There is nothing in this argument.   The United Kingdom already depends on imports for over 80 per cent of its supplies of primary unwroughtaluminium, most of which comes fr om Canada.   There is no scope forfurther aluminium production in the United Kingdom.   In any case, the metal is becoming less and less important for defence purposes as wemove away from conventional aircraft.Possible courses6.        We have considered a number of possible courses.   It is clearthat Her Majesty&apos;s Government could not give approval to the Alcoaproposal alone, or to both the Alcoa and the R.T.I.A. proposal together.(The latter would have the effect of giving the Alcoa proposal a clearfield since B.A.C. have a binding agreement, subject only to Treasuryconsent, to issue 4j million shares to Alcoa.) Although if it had stoodalone, the Alcoa arrangement would have been to the advantage of 3.A.C.and would have qualified for Treasury consent, in the circumstances eitherdecision seems to be ruled out.   Weighed against the judgment of theB.A.C. Board that the Alcoa proposal was more in the interests of theCompany would be the fact that effective (and perhaps legal) control would pass out of the United Kingdom, and that the imm ediate gain (andpossibly future gain) to the reserves would be less than in the R.T.I.A.proposal.   Moreover, debate would take place against a background of criticism of B.A.C, which will be all the stronger when the full facts are known.   Criticism would fasten in particular on the price at whichthe new shares are to be issued to Alcoa, which would appear to beunfavourable in comparison with the T.I. offer.Conclusions7.        On grounds of national interest, and in the light of the facts now known to us, I believe that the R.T.I.A. proposal is to be preferred,mainly because the fact that the British shareholding will be concentrated in   one hand will ensure not only that legal but also effective control would remain in the United Kingdom.   Alcoa have, it is true, issued astatement disclaiming any intention of seeking to acquire control of.A.C., but it is clear that as the largest single shareholder their influence in its affairs would be very great.   Either proposal seems likelyto assure B.A.C. of adequate financial support for further developments.In the immediate future the R.T.I.A. proposal is the more favourable, both to the United Kingdom reserves and to the shareholders of the Company,in view of the higher price of their offer.8.        While I prefer the R.T.IA. proposal, I do not think that theAlcoa proposal should be finally ruled out at this stage.   This could onlybe done if the Government were to say that, even if the shareholdersrejected the T.I. bid, they would not give consent to the Alcoa proposal.I do not recommend that we should say this.  As regards the T.I.offer, this cannot in any event become effective unless and until the shareholders consent to it.   The T.I. offer cannot therefore be finally settled until that has happened.
9.        This being so, I suggest that the Governments line should bethat, though there is not much to choose between the two proposals fromthe point of view of direct gain to the reserves and access to further capital, they feel it would be preferable thsit effective control of theCompany should remain in the United Kingdom.   They therefore believe it right to withhold their consent to the Alcoa deal pending a decision bythe shareholders as to whether they would prefer to accept the T.I.offer.   If the shareholders accept, the Government will make that choiceeffective by refusing consent to the proposal involving Alcoa.   TheGovernment would not be prepared, taking into consideration all thecircumstances and the relative merits of the two offers, to deny the shareholders an opportunity of considering the T.I. offer by givingconsent to the Alcoa proposal now (or by giving immediate consent to both proposals simultaneously - in effect to shut out the T.I. offer).10.       If the Government take this line, the Board of B.A.C. will doubtless issue a statement to their shareholders recommending againstthe T.I. offer.   The Governments action will, however, have ensured &quot;thatthe Board will have to do this on the merits of the two propositions, andnot merely on the existence of a prior contract between them and Alcoa.11.       The applications were considered by the Capital IssuesCommittee on Wednesday, 3rd December on the lines that exchange control consent might be given to either.   They have recommendedCapital Issues consent in each case.12.      A statement could be made in the House of Commons after questions on  Thursday on the lines of the annexed draft.   But there isa question of timing.   We have just learnt that 3.A.C. and T.I. have promised further statements this weekend.   It is possible that Alcoawill improve on their offer.   I therefore recommend that we should wait until Monday, at the earliest, before making the statement.F.J.E.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.3rd December, 1958-4-
With permission, I will make a statement about the BritishAluminium Company.2.        I have had before me two proposals affecting the capitalisationand ownership of the British Aluminium Company, each of which requiresboth Exchange Control and Capital Issues consent.   The first proposalinvolves the issue to the Aluminium Company of America of 4-^ millionordinary shares of the British Aluminium Company.   The second proposalinvolves an offer by Tube Investments Limited to purchase the whole ofthe ordinary shares of the British Aluminium Company.   Their intention is then to transfer these to Reynolds T.I. Aluminium Limited, an existingcompany in which Tube Investments Limited would have a 51 per cent of the shares and of the voting rights.   49 per cent would be held byReynolds Metals Company, an American company.3.        It is clear that if the enormous development plans of theBritish Aluminium Company are to proceed with the speed and effective-ness which is desirable, a considerable amount of new capital will berequired from one source or another.   Both proposals raise, however,a number of difficult and important issues.4.        From the purely exchange point of view, both the issue of sharesto the Aluminium Company of America and the Reynolds T.I. Aluminiumproposal would result in an addition to the gold and dollar reserves.5.        Then there is the question of further capital for the BritishAluminium Company&apos;s development programme.   The issue o  sharesto the Aluminium Company of America will provide the company with substantial new capital.   In addition, the Aluminium Company of Americahave publicly stated their intention of giving full support to the Board ofthe British Aluminium Company in carrying out its present development plans.6.        In the case of the Reynolds T.I. Aluminium proposal, no new capital is provided immediately but the Treasury have a letter from TubeInvestments on behalf of themselves and Reynolds Metals stating thatthey will provide the British Aluminium Company with the necessarycapital for its operations and development.   Neither the public statementnor the letter is more than a declaration of intention.7.        Finally, there is the question of control.   The Government havea statutory right under the Exchange Control Act to consider whether thenational interest is served by the transfer of shares in an undertaking from British to foreign ownership which might ultimately lead to thetransfer of control.   The British Aluminium Company is clearly thekind of undertaking on which this question would arise.   In considering this, not merely the legal, but also the de facto situation must be takeninto account.   Experience has shown that in large companies of thiskind even 30 per cent ownership in a single hand can command effective control.annex draft STATEMENT
8.         U the considerations of foreign exchange or access to further capital had pointed conclusively in one direction, the Government wouldnot have been disposed to think that this was outweighed in the present case by the question of control. /  But since these considerations arefairly well balanced, the Government think it right to withhold their consent to the Aluminium Company of America proposal, pending adecision from the shareholders as to whether they would prefer to acceptthe Tube Investments offer.   If the shareholders accept, the Governmentwill make that choice effective by granting approval to the T.I. proposal in preference to the proposal involving the Aluminium Company ofAmerica,   If the shareholders do not accept the Reynolds-T.I. offer theGovernment would then be prepared to consider afresh the alternativeAlcoa proposal should the parties still wish to proceed with it.9.        This decision has been communicated to the companies concerned.DECEMBER, 1958-6-
