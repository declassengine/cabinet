(THIS^pCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 202 COPY MO. *) 31st Pctober, 1958CABINETBRITISH TRANSPORT commission memorandum by the Minister of transport and Civil aviation in C.(58) 193 I warned my colleagues that the recession hasbitten deeply into the transport sphere and that I was examining the finances of the three nationalised transport corporations.   The british transport Commission, who are in an extremely vulnerable position anyway,have proved to be the worst affected.   Their position is clearly set outin the attached letter (Annex A) from the Chairman of the Commission,Sir Brian Robertson, and it will be seen that we must envisage a very largeaddition to their deficit.   The total deficit for 1958 may well be some 85 mi&apos;lions on a turnover of approximately  700 millions.   This compares with a deficit of  63. 5 millions for 1957.2. It is difficult to blame the Commission for this state of affairsbecause, as Sir Brian Robertsonfs letter clearly shows, it has arisenalmost entirely from the severe recession in the coal and steel industries.But for this the Commission would actually have reduced their deficit to 55 millions by the drastic economies they have carried through.   this situation raises three problems:-(i)  What is to be done abou&apos;. the letter of 22nd October, 1957which limited the Governments advances against the commissions deficit for 1958 to  63. 5 millions?(ii)  Even if the Commission materially improve their positionnext year, as they will providing that coal and steelimprove, they will need an addition to the  250 millionsauthorised in the Railway Finances Act 1957 to cover theirdeficits until modernisation paid off.(iii)  How best to present this situation so as to prevent thespreading of an exaggerated impression at home andabroad about the severity of the recession which hasoccurred in our basic industries.I have set out suggested answers to these problems in a draft letter to Sir Brian Robertson, which I also attach (Annex B).-i-confidential confidential
CONFIDENTIAL103. I hope that my colleagues will agree, in principle, that this isthe best way to handle this most difficult matter.   It is of course for sir Brian Robertson and not the Government to disclose the state of the commissions finances, and he is most anxious to utter some warningwords as otherwise the inevitable conclusion will be drawn from the monthly freight figures and there is much merit, he feels, in making a voluntary disclosure rather than having it dragged out of him by the Press.H.W.Ministry of Transport and civil Aviation, W.l.1st October, 1958-2-confidential 
BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION        m 11        -Telephone: A r na b w% ^    . 222, MARYLEBONE ROAD,AMBassador 77ix ANM^X   A--.  1  x LONDON, N.W.i.29th September, 1958.1. You are aware, from the discussions which we havehad, of the grave fall in bulk and heavy traffics whichhas occurred, particularly during the third quarter ofthe year, and of the consequent effect on the Commissionsrevenue.     From the results of the present year, so far asthey are known to us, it now becomes ,apparent that the deficit of the Commission for 1958 will be considerably morethan the amount of the 1957 deficit.     This is a situationwhich we should face now although its final scope cannotbe known for some months.      I know that you agree with this.I am, therefore, writing to bring together the whole storyand to present it to you comprehensively and, indeed, to summarise our own discussions.background. The forecasts given in the White Paper of October1956 were expressly based upon certain assumptions whichare set out in paragraph 3 of the Commission^ memorandum to you of September 1956, and reproduced on page 11 of theWhite Paper.     This stated that &quot;throughout the review andin estimating the future margin between revenue andexpenditure the Commission have, of necessity, framed theirforecasts on the basis of the present value of money and a continuance of current economic conditions.&quot;     The commission have done their utmost to meet increases in costs andforeseeable declines in revenues, and thus keep within thelimits of their financial plan.     The serious drop inactivity, particularly in heavy industry, in recent months has, however, caused a precipitous fall in the revenues ofBritish Railways quite beyond anything envisaged when theCommission submitted their memorandum embodied in the white paper of 1956.     This is exemplified in Appendices &apos;B&apos; and&apos;C to this letter.THE TRAFFIC POSITION3. The fall in British Railways traffic receipts for thefirst 36 weeks of 1958, by comparison with the Commission^budget estimates, is tabulated in Appendix *A&apos; to this letter.The sum total of all railway traffic receipts for the first36 weeks shows a decline of over  18m.  (5g$).     Consideringthe state of trade, passenger traffic is remarkably buoyant,total passenger receipts having receded by no more than 1.3m.  (iTgfo) and, wherever modernised passenger services have been introduced, there has been an improvement in thenet revenue position.     Total freight receipts have, however,shrunk by no less than  16.7m.  (7%).     The preponderance of loss is, therefore, in the freight field, especially in thecase of coal and minerals.Rt. Hon. Harold Watkinson, M.P.
In fact, the level of industrial activity in industriesvital to the railways is now running below the level of 1956.There has been virtually no increase in coal production, a fallin coal imports and a large increase in undistributed coalstocks.     Consequently the tonnage available for transporthas fallen when it was expected that it would rise.     Therailway receipts from coal class traffic provide over 40 percent of their total freight train traffic receipts and, inconsequence, the fall in demand for coal has had a serious effect on revenue.The iron and steel industry is second in importance onlyto the coal industry in its contribution to railway freight for,in addition to the coal class traffic carried on its behalf,this industry provides about one-fifth of freight train trafficreceipts.     It was expected that the steady growth of the ironand steel industry would provide additional traffic receiptsin the first five years of the Modernisation Plan.     However,towards the middle of 1957 the output of the iron and steelindustry ceased to rise.     By the end of the year 1957 thedecline had already begun, and in the second quarter of 1958,when consumers of steel began to reduce their stocks, therewere immediate repercussions throughout the industry.At the beginning of 1958, carryings of iron ore were only slightly below the 1957 level, but by the second quarter,when home ore production was nearly 20 per cent down, and imported ore consumption in pig iron manufacture about15 per cent down, railway carryings showed a similar fall.Scrap consumption in steel-making had fallen to some10 to 15 per cent below the 1957 level by the second quarter.Railway carryings have fallen by a bigger percentage becausescrap accumulated at works is being used up first.     Similarly,pig iron carryings were much reduced, because the fall in thetonnage requiring transport was greater than the 10 to 15 percent fall in production.     Deliveries of semi-finished steelfell by 15 to 20 per cent and the decline in railway carryingswas broadly similar.     Carryings of finished steel have declinedin proportion to the deliveries to steel users.The position is revealed even more strikingly in QAppop^jnfis  &apos;B&apos; and &apos;C to this letter, which illustrate the sudden steepening of the decline in bulk traffics during thepresent year.      In the&apos;case of these traffics (coal, minerals,etc.) in particular, the fall in receipts is not due todiversion to other forms of transport.     It would be wrong to suppose that the Commission have been the only sufferers.It is the Commission^ belief that all public transport by rail, road and water, whether nationalised or in privatehands, finds the present situation difficult and regards thefuture as a matter for serious concern.
10. The severe and unpredicted fall in the level ofproduction by the heavy industries is thus the crux of theCommission^ revenue problem at this time.     The fall inreceipts from coal and mineral traffics alone is now at therate of over  600,000 a week compared with last year, or atthe rate of over  30m. a year.11. Future rail carryings depend very much on the prospects of a revival of industrial activity, and especially upon thefuture course of events in the heavy industries.     There isno indication from the industries concerned that they regardtheir present trading   position as involving any change intheir long-term planning for a steady rise in production.In these circumstances, the Commission must work upon theassumption that the present decline in these traffics is atemporary condition, calling for short-term measures.-   REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE IN 195812. Early in 1958 the revenue budget proposals for thatyear, which in accordance with normal practice had beensubmitted towards the end of 1957, were carefully reviewed.As a result, the Area Boards&apos; budgets for the Railway Regionsas finally approved by the Commission were substantiallyrevised to ensure that the Commissions net deficit for 1958was reduced to  55m., a figure broadly in line with the forecast given in the White Paper.     Since there was littlescope for increases in rates and fares, this involved areduction of some  14m. in the expenditure proposed by theArea Boards.     An intensive drive was, therefore, launchedthrough the Area Boards to effect further savings in working expenses.     Action was taken to effect staff reductions,to curtail overtime and Sunday working, to reduce the wagonstock, to defer a certain amount of repair and maintenanceof structures, track and vehicles without incurring anaccumulation of deferred maintenance, and to curtailuneconomic train mileage.13. Following joint discussions in May on the question ofrailway wages and salaries, the Commission and the tradeunions reached agreement for increases costing about  10m.in a full year, on the understanding that both sides wouldmutually play their part in the reduction of railway working expenses.     The Commission gave assurances to the Governmentthat they would reduce their working expenses and theGovernment for their part undertook to increase the capital investment in British Railways in 1958 and 1959 above the restricted limits imposed in October 1957 and to grant theCommission relief towards the maintenance of road bridgesover railways, and of level crossings.9. The Commission also draw attention, as a matter ofrecord, to the decline in Government traffic passing by-British Railways.     The total receipts from this source were 25-gm. in 1956,  25m. in 1957 and at current levels thefigure for 1958 is not likely to exceed  20m.     passenger and freight train traffic each account for about half of thetotal.
14. After allowing for the help from the Government and for selective limited increases in fares and charges, further reductions in expenditure at the rate of some  6m. a year were needed to meet the remainder of the cost of the wagesagreement and were put in hand.STEPS TAKEN TO IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL POSITIONSavings on British Railways15. The principal steps taken to reduce expenditure on british Railways, and their results to date, are :-(a) Reduction in Staff.The total British Railways staff in August 1958 was 563,000,a reduction of 17,000 or 3 per cent on the correspondingperiod last year;    and reduction is continuing.     Some60 per cent of the annual expenditure on British Railwaysis on salaries and wages, and savings in expenditure are bound to be felt by the staff.     The Commission, therefore,are careful to keep the trade unions informed on their financial position and on the measures in hand to correct it.(b) Reduction in Wagon Fleet.The total number of British Railways wagons in September,1958, was slightly over one million, a reduction of 57,000or 5 per cent compared with the- corresponding period lastyear.     This process continues.(c) Rationalisation of the System.(i) A recent survey of current proposals for the withdrawalof passenger or freight services, or both, from particularsections of railway showed that 52 such proposals had beenor.were likely to be submitted during 1958, involvingestimated net annual savings approaching  1-g- million.     this includes over  600,000 anticipated saving from the proposalto withdraw services from nearly the whole of the formerMidland &amp; Great Northern Joint Lines in East Anglia, whichlargely represent duplicate facilities.(ii) During the second half of 1958 the drive for economy measures of this nature has been intensified, and thereprobably will have been submitted to the ConsultativeCommittees by the end of the year the majority of the&quot;easier&quot; cases.     New submissions will include proposalsof greater size and importance, which though taking longer to examine may result in substantial financial benefits.About 35 cases of all kinds are likely to be submittedto the Consultative Committees between now and June 1959.
(d) Curtailment in Train Mileage.(i) To reduce passenger train mileage in cases wherecomplete withdrawal of services from a section of lineor stations was not desirable, substantial cuts in services were effected during the 1958 Summer Service.     further economies have been made in the 1958 Winter Train Service,the effect of which isAverage Weekly Passenger Train MilesSteam Electric     Diesel TotalWinter1957-58Winter1958-592,660,0002,375,000970,000950,000358,000575,0003,988,0003,900,000C+) or(-) - 285,000     - 20,000   + 217,000       - 88,000    (2$)There is thus a substantial saving (11$) in the steam mileage,a smaller saving in electric mileage, and an increase of61$ in diesel-worked mileage.     The last-named representsmainly the continuing introduction of multiple-unit dieseltrains, the greater availability and quicker turn round ofwhich are being exploited for traffic-building purposes.Further reductions in passenger train mileage are planned.(ii)    The reduction in freight train mileage amounts toabout 5 per cent below last year&apos;s level.     Some of this isdue to falling traffics, and some of it to more economicalmethods of working.     Every effort is being made to presshome the reduction of expenditure without lowering thestandard of service to traders.16. For the first 32 weeks of the year, the Working Expensesof British Railways are estimated to be within  2m., or -g- percent, of the revised target for that period.     The effect of measures taken to reduce them is being increasingly felt, andit is expected that the working expenses for the full year will be very near to budget.     This indicates that the economy measures referred to in para. 12 above are being fully appliedand will be reflected in the results for the year.     There isalso good reason to expect that the additional steps taken under para. 14 will be reflected in the rate of expenditure at the year1s end.Other Activities17. The Commission have also reviewed the revenue budgetsfor their other activities, and wherever possible savings arebeing made in order to improve the overall revenue position.
Increased Charges18. A 10 per cent increase in certain charges for merchandisetraffic carried by passenger train was introduced on 1st August,1958, giving an estinated yield of  750,000 in a full year.19. The process of adjusting sub-standard local passenger fares throughout the country has been continuing. Beyondselective adjustments of this nature, any question of a general increase in passenger fares nust necessarily await the decisionof the Transport Tribunal on the Passenger Charges Schemewhich the Commission lodged on 1st September.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL POSITION20, In the light of present traffic trends, the Commissioncannot assume that there will be any material improvementin the gross receipts of British Railways during the remainder of the year.     On this basis, the broad financial picture forthe year 1958 may be as set out in the next paragraph, but a firm estimate of the position cannot be made for some months.21. The target for the year 1958 for British Railways wasa reduction of the deficit (after including Central Charges,mainly interest) to  55m.     The shortfall in gross receiptsas compared with the target of  505m. is likely to be notless than  30m,     The net receipts from the Commission^other activities are not expected to do more than covertheir share of central charges.     The deficit of theCommission for the year 1958 may accordingly be of theorder of  85m.22. In a situation such as this, the financial structure of the Commission has the disadvantage compared with otherbusinesses and indeed most other transport undertakings, thatthe fixed interest on Transport Stock which the Commission haveto pay is an expense which has to be met in full each yearwhatever the earnings may be;    there is no equity capitalwhich can go insufficiently rewarded or unrewarded in a badyear.     It has not been possible to build up a general reservewhich could be used to meet an emergency.23. Of the  250m. of &quot;deficit&quot; borrowings authorised bythe Transport (Railway Finances) Act 1957,  118m. has beenborrowed in respect of the years 1956 and 1957. assuming the deficit for the year 1958 to be of the order of  85m.,the total borrowings in respect of the three years 1956 to1958 (if the Commission borrow the full deficit of 1958)would amount to about  200m. The Commission^ totalborrowing powers in respect of deficits may, therefore, be exhausted during 1959.
24. In these circumstances, the Commission have consideredthe emergency measures to &quot;be taken under two main heads,namely i-(a) further reductions in expenditure;    and(b) increases in revenue.Field for further reductions in expenditure25. The Commission have directed the Area Boards to intensify their drive during the remainder of the year toreduce expenditure to meet the present emergency.     TheCommission intend to work towards still greater reductions in their installations, including workshops and goods terminals,and under the former heading have in hand a further reviewof all their facilities for maintenance and for rolling stockconstruction, with a view to greater concentration andco-ordination of their engineering resources.      It was an integral part of the Modernisation Plan that the british railways system should be adapted so as to provide a morecompact network, capable of being fully utilised, and of doing efficiently and cheaply the things railways are bestfitted to do.     While it follows that some services nowprovided by rail will have to be performed by other means oftransport, the continuation of modernisation will ensure thatthe economic value of the railway system as a whole willcontinue to improve.Possible increases in revenue26.  (a) Passenger Traffic.As already stated, the Commission have lodged a newPassenger Charges Scheme with the Transport Tribunal. Ifthe Tribunal approve this Scheme, powers are not likely tobe available to the Commission until early in 1959. Anygeneral increase in British Railways passenger fares wouldhave to be very carefully considered in the light of current market conditions; selective increases will be made where possible.(b) Freight Traffic.The Commission have considered the question ofobtaining increased revenue from freight traffic, assessingevery possibility from overall to selective increases.They consider that an overall emergency increase mightyield temporary advantages only to be succeeded bypermanent disadvantages.     Discussions are in progress withthe heavy industries to improve the revenue from certain important flows of bulk and heavy traffics.     As far aspossible, it is the Commission&apos;s policy to hold down theirfreight charges in order to encourage traffic.EMERGENCY CORRECTIVE ACTION
\MODERNISATION27. Modernisation is itself the &quot;best way of achievingreductions in expenditure and increases in traffics.      Itscontinuation at the present rate is an essential contribution towards making the railways pay their way.      The faster itgoes, the sooner it will pay off.     The stage in modernisationhas now &quot;been reached when, although much planning has yet to&quot;be done, the new equipment in use is ma-king a real impact on the pattern of service v/hich is reflected in the revenueresults.     The most striking evidence is in the field ofdiesel traction, where over 1,000 main line and shuntinglocomotives are now in service;    over 150 diesel main linelocomotives will be in service by the end of the year.There are also over 2,000 multiple unit diesel vehiclesnow in traffic showing such increases in receipts over 1957as 55 per cent in Hampshire and 112 per cent on Tees-side.28. Electrification schemes are well in hand but progress is loss spectacular because of the large amount of associatedengineering work on bridges, stations, signalling and communications.     It is significant, however, that theelectrification of the Shenfield-Southend line has virtuallydoubled the traffic and this, together with the experience in the Southern Region, has fully justified the suburbanelec n-iflcatioil joroj ecxs.29. Modernisation is also having an increasing effecton the standard of freight services.     About 35 per cent of the total freight train mileage is now run by trainsfitted with continuous brakes, compared with 28 per cent a year ago.     Since the inception of the Export ExpressService nearly two years ago, over 28,000 wagon loads of export traffic have been carried to ports without a singleshipment being missed through the fault of British Railways.Freight transits generally have been substantially improved.30. The foregoing examples are evidence that the economicsof the Modernisation Plan have been soundly conceived.
- 9 -CONCLUSION31. The finances of British Railways have beenstruck a violent, unexpected blow by the sharp setbackin the output and traffics of coal, steel and otherbasic industries.32. Having no reserves to meet such an emergency,temporary though it may be, the Commission are facinga financial crisis of gravity and urgency.     Thequestion is - what should be done about it?33. First, the Commission want tp state that nothing has happened to stultify the - appreciation ofthe future prospects of the railways, as set out inthe Y/hite Paper of 1956.     In so far as new equipmenthas already been put into service, it has justified theclaims made for it, as paras-. 27 to 30 show.Increased flexibility in charging methods has givenresults more slowly than was expected, but they are beginning to mature.     In the White Paper it wasspecifically stated that the forecasts made in it were put forward on the assumption that the general levelof the national economy would stay about where it was.A severe, even if temporary, setback in those industries on which the railways are most dependent inevitablyaffects those forecasts.     It has not shaken the commissions confidence in their plans, nor their determination to see their plans through to success.34. The industries with which we are most concerned are, for their part, sticking to their former plans inspite of their present difficulties.     The steelindustry has said so publicly.     The Coal Board know that they are faced with a steady and permanent declinein the market for locomotive and household coal, butthis is the coal which is hardest to mine and easiestto sell abroad.     They are confident that the market for industrial coal and coke will recover, althoughcompetition from oil will take some business from them.35. Our recommendations as to what should be donetake account of these facts.     They are(a) Further Reduction in costs as is set out in this paper, much has beendone during the year and the effect of the action-taken will be fully apparent next year.     However,we are nowhere near the end of the process of the rationalisation of our railway system.     this process was an essential element in the ModernisationPlan.     The kind of steps we are taking now were described in the Plan, but the process is beingaccelerated.     Having put in hand the programme for1958, the Commission are now preparing a programmeof rationalisation for 1959-     The main featureswill be presented to you by the end of the year.At this time I can go no further than say that we
shall take as our target a reduction of  20m.per annum in addition to economies already inoperation, which will yield several millions of pounds more in 1959 than in 1958.(b) Further Efforts to Increase RevenueThe situation as regards faros and chargeshas been outlined in this paper.     Apart fromthis, the drive for more business will, it isbelieved, bring increased results as thedecentralised organisation settles down, and thecommercial officers become more adroit atutilising the greater freedom which they haverecently been given. *(c) Modernisation to be pushedWe remain completely convinced that bymodernisation and rationalisation our railwayscan be made to pay their way.      It is the key.Although-we have been trying to go as fast aspossible, we must try to go faster.     Above allelse we ask for the continuation of theGovernments support in the prosecution of the modernisation Plan.(d) Government AssistanceWhatever the Commission may do to helpthemselves in this crisis, they cannot overcomeit without assistance from the Government.It is not for the Commission to propose what measures should be taken by the Government to seethe Commission through what they must assume, on theinformation available to them, will be only atemporary setback.     The Commission clearly recognise,however, that before additional aid, even of atemporary nature, is given, the Government must besatisfied that the Commission are doing all in their power to help themselves.     I have described above what we have done and what we intend to do.The Commission are anxious that the government shall be satisfied beyond doubt that the position is fairly reflected in this letter.     They would have noobjection to your seeking a verification of the criticalpoints in our presentation of the situation, as set out below, from the auditors whom you appoint(a) That the undertakings which the Commissiongave earlier in the year about steps toreduce working costs of British Railwayswill have been substantially fulfilled bythe end of the year. .
(ti) That the sudden drop in coal and mineraltraffics- is the main cause of the presentposition, and that this drop is due to a fall in the traffic offering rather than to any failure by the Commission to hold their share of these traffics.(Sgd i) BRIAN H. ROBERTSON704/9/8

CONFIDENTIAL h annex draft LETTER FROM THE MINISTER OF transport and CIVIL AVIATION TO SIR BRIAN ROBERTSONThank you for your letter, which sums up the problems that wehave been discussing for some weeks.2. In the Government^ view it would be reasonable to assume thatthe present phase in the economy is temporary and that a future expansionof economic activity is to be expected.   The addition of a possible further 25 millions to the accumulated deficit is, however, as I know you realise,an extremely serious matter, and the maximum effort will be required from all concerned with the future of the railways if it is to be put right.3. The British Transport Commission restates its view as to theessentiality of a modern railway system to our industrial future.   I do not dissent, although; as you recognise, it will have to be a more compact and efficient system than it is today.   I shall look to you and your colleaguestherefore to press forward with your plans for securing economies withthe utmost determination.   I appreciate that the 1958 financial picture is,to a large extent, due to external causes, but it must not be repeated or allsense of financial discipline will be lost.   Nor can the Government envisagean indefinite extension of the time when the Commission will break even.4. To meet the present position the Government would have noobjection to your seeking accommodation from the banks to cover theadditional cost of deficit over the  63. 5 millions to which your advancesare limited for the current year.5. The question of how to meet future deficits can best beconsidered in connection with the general question of the limits on the borrowing powers of the Commission, which is bound to arise in any caseshortly.    /The scale and pace of modernisation will also need to be looked at again in the light of your plans for speeding up economies, as well ofcourse as in relation to the scale of public investment as a whole./6. I welcome your suggestion that the auditors whom I appointshould be asked to verify that the undertakings which the Commission gaveearlier in the year to reduce working costs of British Railways will havebeen substantially fulfilled by the end of the year and that the main causeof the present position is a fall in the coal and mineral traffics offeringrather than any failure by the Commission to hold their share of thesetraffics.   I have, therefore, asked the auditors to let me have their report as soon as possible.CONFIDENTIAL
