secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;? GOVERNMENTi i - ;;iv&apos;i . \nn     Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1958C. (58) 204 Copy No. 6610th October, 1958        .&quot; .CABINETRESERVE FORCES BILL,   Memorandum by the Lord chancellor in C. (58) 194 the Minister of Defence proposed that the Navy, Army andAir Force Reserves Act, 1954, which will expire in June 1959, should be extended for a further five years in respect of men who joined the forces after 1948. he proposed also that we should take advantage of the opportunity afforded by this legislation to take new powers to create a special section of the Territorial Army,composed of men who would voluntarily accept the liability to be embodied for service at home or overseas without a Proclamation.2 On 29th September the Cabinet remitted this question to a committee consisting of the Home Secretary (in the Chair), the Minister of Defence, theMinister of Labour, the Secretary of State for War and the Financial Secretaryto the Treasury (C.C. (58) 73rd Conclusions, Minute 3). In the absence of theHome Secretary, I have presided over this Committee; and in this memorandum I present their report on the scope of the legislation to be introduced in theforthcoming session.3. We are satisfied that there is a strong military case for some addition tothe Reserve Forces which exist at present. The peace-time Army will be fullycapable of undertaking internal security duties and minor actions of short duration(such as the recent operations in Muscat and Jordan) without having to recallreservists. But, irrespective of its size, it will always lack certain administrative units, without which the Strategic Reserve cannot function adequately in largeremergencies or limited wars. The men in question are mainly specialists whowould have no full-time job in the peace-time Army, would be hard to recruitin peace and would be of greater service to the nation working in civilian tasks.It is not in dispute that such men are most easily to be found in the TerritorialArmy and that neither Section A of the regular Reserve nor Category 1 of theArmy Emergency Reserve (the two sections of our Reserve Forces which can becalled up without a Proclamation) will, produce the numbers or the types of personnel required.4. Nevertheless, there are serious objections to the proposal that we shouldtake additional statutory powers, at this point in the Government^ life, to constitute a new kind of Territorial Army Reserve on the lines proposed inC. (58) 194:-(a) In spite of the undoubted military advantages of this scheme we shouldbe unwise politically to put ourselves in a position, at this time, inwhich we could be accused, however wrongly, of deliberately soarranging matters that we could embark on a policy of militaryadventure, on the model of Suez, without a Proclamation. We can allremember &quot; Whose finger on the trigger?&quot;(b) We should also risk the public criticism that our need for this additionalreserve is the direct result of our Service manpower policy. It is truethat a reorganisation of the Reserve Forces follows logically from there organisation of the Army and that Parliament has already been warned that, having put in hand the latter, we have it in mind to tackle the former.  But this will not deter our opponents from representing54163SECRET&apos;
our proposals for the Territorial Army Reserve as something quitenew and unforeseen, and as something which indicates the failure ofour policy of relying on all regular forces. The criticism might be ill-founded; but that would not prevent it from being made,(c) The proposal involves the payment to the volunteers in question of a tax-free bounty of  100 a year, at a total annual cost in the region of  3 millions. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has considerabledoubts on this point, both as regards the size of the total expenditure and as regards the principle of a tax-free bounty.5. For these reasons the Committee recommend that the legislation to beintroduced in the forthcoming session should be confined to the renewal of the1954 Act (in respect of men who joined the Forces after 1948) and that, if it becomes necessary to call up reserves additional to those available in Section of the Regular Reserve on Category 1 of the Army Emergency Reserve, we shouldcontinue to rely on a Proclamation. The additional clauses relating to the proposed new Territorial Army Reserve should be drafted, and held ready for introduction in a subsequent session. But it will still be necessary for the Cabinet to reach adecision on the issues discussed in paragraph 4 above ,before there can be anyquestion of introducing, even in a later session, legislation to constitute a TerritorialArmy Reserve on the lines indicated in C. (58) 194.K.House of Lords, S.W. 1,10th October, 1958.
