C. (58) 229 Copy No.4th November, 1958CABINETEUROPEAN FREE TRADE AREANote by the Prime minister the failure to make any real progress so far in the negotiations for a european free Trade Area, which the Paymaster-General- has reported, presents us with serious economic and political problems. We must continue to strive for theestablishment of a Free Trade Area, on terms satisfactory to us, alongside theCommon Market which is due to come into being on 1st January, 1959; at thesame time we must be prepared if we do not succeed in this objective. Afterconsultation with the Ministers mainly concerned, I have decided that the followingplan of work should be carried out.2 For the present we should do everything we can to keep the Free trade area negotiations going on a constructive footing. But if, by the end of November,it has become clear that the French are unwilling to make any genuine progress, weshould ourselves break off the negotiations. This should be done in such a way as to leave the door open for their later resumption if that became feasible.3.   To this end, we should forthwith (a) Try to mobilise at a high level the support of the Americans for thecreation of a Free Trade Area contemporaneously with the common market. We could point to the damage that a Common Marketorganised on French protectionist lines would do to American economic interests. More important, we could emphasise the danger to the wholeWestern position if the Six establish their Common Market without a free Trade Area. Faced with the economic challenge, the UnitedKingdom would have to make a reappraisal of our role in EuropeanSECRETTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

Moreover, a Common Market with a high degree ofprotection for foodstuffs and basic materials would have serious disadvantages for many underdeveloped countries.(b) Consider the desirability of denouncing the Western European UnionTreaty and using the possibility of that in our discussions with theFrench. We could hope to secure the support of the Americans for the- v* argument that while we would do our best in the North Atlantic treaty organisation the economic behaviour of the Six makes the closepolitical and military link contemplated in the Western European Unionquite unrealistic.(c) Consider also whether we should take steps to stimulate Dr. Adenauer,the German Federal Chancellor, to invite the Prime Minister andGeneral de Gaulle, the French Prime Minister, to a conference toconsider a solution on political lines. But we must be prepared forthis in advance and work out what form of compromise we could accept which would allow the French some breathing space, if necessary by some special provisions for France, and at the same time avoid the disruption of Western Europe into two hostile economic camps.(A reaffirmation of the desire for a Free Trade Area in principle wouldbe the worst possible outcome of such a conference.)4. At the same time we must try to prepare, as follows, against the totalfailure of these negotiations (a) We should consider the arguments for and against taking discriminatoryaction against the Six, e.g., by the imposition or reduction of quotaswhen the Common Market comes into operation.(b) We should consider also inviting the countries outside the Six to aconference designed to establish a second Common Market with them,and the possibility of securing the adherence of Canada to such ascheme.(c) We should work out (and begin to deploy) a realistic public relations case,presenting this critical situation in such a way as to justify an eventualcompromise if one were to be negotiated, or an alternative policy (suchas (a) or (b) above) if we are forced to move in that direction.5. I have asked the Paymaster-General, as the Minister responsible for supervising and co-ordinating the negotiations for the Free Trade Area, to pursue this plan of work in consultation with the other Ministers concerned, through theofficial machinery which is already in being.H.
