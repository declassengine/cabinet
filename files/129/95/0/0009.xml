secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFTIER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1958C. (58) 209 Copy No.17th October, 1958CABINETCOMPENSATION FOR COMPULSORY  ACQUISITION OF  land memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh AffairsThe Home Affairs Committee have considered certain points in connectionwith the Bill to provide for compensation on a market value basis for compulsory acquisition of land; and have decided that one of them must be reserved for finaldecision by the Cabinet.2. The question at issue is what provision, if any, should be included in theBill to meet the problem of &quot; planning blight &quot; that is, of property which becomesunsaleable, or saleable only at much reduced prices, because of the prospect of future public acquisition, a prospect usually disclosed by Development Plans butalso sometimes by local Acts and Trunk or Special Road orders.3. The Home Affairs Committee provisionally decided that the best coursewould be to oblige developing authorities to buy residential property blighted bythe prospect of public acquisition (if the owner desired to sell, and whether ornot he could prove actual hardship), combined with a discretionary power toacquire other types of property. The drafting of the Bill has proceeded on this basis. I should add that almost all the cases of hardship coming to the noticeof my Department up to now have been cases of owner-occupiers of house property.4. At a confidential meeting, the local authority associations maintained that all that was needed was a discretionary power for local authorities to buyproperty of any kind, including houses, in advance of requirements, provided thatwhen they exercised this discretion the Government Department concerned wouldmake loan sanction available and would pay grant where the service was grant-aided. In my view, however, Parliament would not be content with this. At thesame time, to extend the obligatory provisions to include non-residential propertywould mean taking on a potentially very large commitment; whose size cannotbe estimated, and for much of which there would be no real justification. Therecan be hard cases where non-residential property ought to be acquired; in one Irecall, a small firm whose factory lay on the site of a future road was anxious to expand but could not do so on their existing site, which was to be acquired from them in due course, and could not move elsewhere unless they could dispose oftheir existing premises. But there might equally be another case where the factorywas not doing very well, and the owner would jump at the chance of unloadingthe property on to the local authority although the scheduling for acquisition atsome future date was hot the cause of his troubles. I have considered this ascarefully as I can, and in my view it will be best to leave it to acquiring authoritiesto exercise discretion in cases of non-residential property, taking power for theMinister of Transport to assist a local authority with grant where, in connectionwith a road scheme, an authority does proceed with early acquisition.5. The Home Affairs Committee asked if an estimate could be prepared ofthe probable cost. This has been examined, but it is not possible to produce any54197
Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,17th October, 1958.worth-while estimate of the cost either of an obligation limited to houses, or ofan obligation extending to all types of property. We could not, without exhaustiveexamination, estimate the value of property of different types threatened by schemesof public development; and even if we could put some figure on that, we couldnot begin to guess at the extent to which owners might wish to sell before theyhad to. All that can be said is that the obligation to buy houses might cost as-much as  3 millions in a year, the burden falling mainly on the Exchequer; aridthat to extend it to all types of property could run into several millions mqr-e.The cost would be largely concentrated in particular areas, and even with exchequer grant it could hit some authorities very hard indeed. The representatives of localauthorities would certainly object very strongly indeed to an unqualified obligationto buy any property, whether the owner was suffering hardship or not, and would maintain that, given grant where due, they could and should be trusted to behavefairly. N6. I hope that the Cabinet will endorse the conclusion of the Home AffairsCommittee that the right course is to make provision in the Bill for an obligatoryscheme to acquire residential property if the owner so desires, combined with a discretionary scheme for non-residential property.H.
