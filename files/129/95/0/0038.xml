This correspondswith the similar White paper on the general grant for Englandand Wales which is being circulated by the Minister of Housing andLocal Government.2.        The Scottish Order will simply prescribe the total sumsto be payable to local authorities in Scotland by way of general grant.It has been agreed with the Treasury on the official level that these should be  50.125 millions for 1959-60 and  52.075 millions for 1960-61.3.        The White paper explains how these sums have been arrived at,by reference to the principles laid down in the Act and by the adjustments in respect of industrial re-rating and other matters already announced,from estimates of expenditure submitted by local authorities.   Themethod of calculation has been explained to the Scottish Local authority associations, who have accepted the outcome subject to a few furtheradjustments which they suggested and to which effect has been givenin the grant totals with the agreement of the Treasury.4.       I now invite my colleagues to agree -(a) that the Order should provide for grants of  50.125 millions and  52. 075 millions respectively in the two years of thegrant period;(b) that I should present a White Paper on the lines of theattached draft, together with the Order.I shall be grateful if ( in the circumstances explained in the Ministerof Housing&apos;s memorandum) Ministers who may wish to offer any comments on these proposals will kindly let me have them bymidday on 20th November.J.

draft the General Grant (Scotland) Order, 1958A Report under section 1 of theLocal Government and MiscellaneousFinancial Provisions (Scotland)Act, 1958Introductory1.     Section 1 of the Act requires the Secretary of State with the consentof the Treasury to make general grant orders for periods of not less than two or more than three years fixing the aggregate amount of the generalgrants payable for the years in question; to make such orders after con-sultation with the local authority associations; and to lay the orders beforethe House of Commons together with a report explaining the considerationsleading to their provisions.2.     It was indicated during the Parliamentary proceedings before the passingof the Act that the first general grant order would cover a period of twoyears.   The Order which has now been laid provides for different amounts ofgeneral grant for each of these years, namely,  50.125 million for1959-60 and  52.075 million for 1960-61.3.     Section 2(1) of the Act provides that -&quot;In fixing the aggregate amount of the general grants for any year theSecretary of State shall take into consideration -(a) the latest information available to him of the rate of relevant expenditure (excluding, except in so far as theSecretary of State with the consent of the Treasuryotherwise determines, any expenditure of a descriptionin respect of which no grant has been paid for any year ending before the sixteenth day of May, nineteen hundredand fifty-nine) and the current level of prices, costs and remuneration, together with any future variation inthat level which can be foreseen;(b) any probable fluctuation in the demand for the servicesgiving rise to relevant expenditure, so far as the fluc-situation is attributable to circumstances prevailing inScotland as a whole which are not under the control oflocal authorities; and(c) the need for developing those services and the extent towhich, having regard to general economic conditions, itis reasonable to develop those services.&quot;

The figures quoted thereforerelate only to the estimated increase in expenditurecompared with 1958-59.(b) Two other classes of expenditure, not included in the table,have also been taken into account in calculating the rateof relevant expenditure for grant purposes:-2.confidential.     This is the first gene5a?r4rUfr\EferIeALto he made under the Act.   Itembodies certain features described below (e.g., the effects of the abolitionof certain minor grants and of re-rating, and the repercussions on theExchequer equalisation grant) vshich will not recur.   In future years, there-fore, the procedure followed in determining the total amounts of the grantmay not he the same.The Rate of Relevant expenditure .     Local authorities were asked to provide estimates of their expenditure at the current level of costs on the major services to he covered by thegeneral grant for the two years of the first grant period.   These figures were adjusted by the Scottish Departments in the light of such furtherinformation as was available.   These adjustments vrere discussed with thelocal authority associations, and some modifications were made in the lightof their comments.   The result is set out in the following table.1959-60 1960-61   Education 69,675*COO       72,577,000
/ . \   CONFIDENTIAL(x) the Town and Country Planning Bill now beforeParliament proposes to amend the basis for the compulsory acquisition of land.     It is not expectedthat the annual increased relevant expenditure incurred by local authorities if the Bill is enactedwill be a figure of any magnitude.    The amount hasbeen estimated at . 20,000 in 1959-60 and  40,000in 1960-61.(ii) regard has also been had to estimates ofexpenditure on accommodation under the national assistance Act, 1948.    They are not included inthe table because they are of a different characterfrom the figures for other services, being mainlycapital expenditure.The &quot;Basic figure&quot; of General Grant6.     These totals (adjusted as explained in note (b)) take account of suchfuture variations in the level of prices, costs and remuneration as can before seen, and also of any probable fluctuation in the demand for the relevant services.     They also appear, having regard to the fact that the revised estimates of relevant expenditure for 1959-60 and 1960-61 are larger than the actual net expenditure ( 69,489 ,918) incurred in 1957-58, to makereasonable provision for the need of developing these services and for theextent that, having regard to economic conditions, it is reasonable todevelop them.     It is therefore the Secretary of State&apos;s view that it wouldhe proper to accept them as complying with the requirements of section 2 ofthe Act and to provide from public assistance funds towards expenditure atthis rate on broadly the same scale as obtains at present.7.     A further adjustment has been made at this stage in respect of the contribution (at present  60,000) made by education authorities to theScottish universities.     This sum has been added to the aggregate amountof the general grant.     YVhen the report of the Committee which is considering the future of this contribution has been received this additionto the grant will be offset by the deduction provided for in paragraph 1(a)of Part I of the Ohird Schedule to the Act.8.     In the light of the above considerations the Secretary of Stateproposes that the &quot;basic figures&quot; of general grant for 1959-60 and 1960-61should be  49.663 million and  51.618 million.     These &quot;basic figures&quot;require further adjustments (which will not recur in subsequent periods) as explained in paragraphs 10-12 below.Discontinued minor grants9.     Section 4 of the Act provided for the discontinuance of a number of minor grants (i.e., those for compensation for loss of fees from the
licensing of hackney carriages, trolley vehicles, etc., portable wheelweighers, rodent control, and salaries of highway engineers and surveyors).These have added to the total of the general grant for the initial period.The White Paper on Local Government Finance in Scotland (Cmnd.208)estimated their total at  65,000.The effect of Re-rating10.   Section 7 of the Act provides for the re-rating of industry to50 per cent, instead of 25 per cent, of net annual value, thus increasingrateable value in all areas where industrial premises are situated.    V7hilere-rating will increase rate income, it will also reduce the product of income tax, profits tax and surtax by an amount equal to approximately halfthe increase, and it was indicated in the White Paper that Government grantswould accordingly &quot;be reduced by two-thirds of the estimated product of re-rating, i.e.,  2.3 million.     This means that the general grant should,strictly speaking, be abated by  1.53 million.     Section 7(2) of the Act,however, provides for salmon net fishings from 1959 onwards to be treated for rating purposes as agricultural lands and heritages.     This in turnwill involve a loss of rateahle income to local authorities, and to offsetthis loss it is proposed to confine the reduction in grant as a result of re-rating to  1.5 million.Exchequer equalisation grant11.   The introduction of the general grant system, and the changes inEngland and Y/ales under the Local Government Act, 1958, will affect theamount of the Exchequer equalisation grant which would otherwise have beenpayable.     As the White Paper on Local Government Finance also explained,it has been decided to make good this amount by adding it to the general grant.     This amount has been estimated at  1.9 million.Final Calculation of the General Grant12. Taking these factors together, the Government propose that the amountto be received by local authorities in Scotland by way of general grant in1959-60, should be as follows:-
(  million)General Grant49.663Less Net deduction to offsetre-rating income1*548.163Plus Compensation for reductionof equalisation grantCompensation for discontinuedminor grants.065 50.1281.9This will he rounded to  50.125 million;    the corresponding figure for1960-61 will be  52.075 million.Method of Payment13.   The aggregate of the general grants will be distributed to individuallocal authorities in accordance with the formula set out in the second schedule to the Act, and the amount which each authority will receive willbe notified as soon as possible.    Payment will be made by monthly instalments, and in future the Exchequer equalisation grant, which is atpresent payable in two-monthly instalments, wij.1 also be payable monthly.The relevant Regulations will be amended for this purpose.14.   It was also indicated in paragraph 10 of the White Paper that the full amount of the general grant for each year would be paid in that year, butthat it would be necessary to reach this position by stages.     The advancesduring the year to which they relate of the grants to be absorbed in thegeneral grant range from 90 to 95 per cent.     In 1959-60 the government intend to pay 94 per cent, of the general grant for that year (togetherwith the balances of the superseded specific grants for 1958-59) and in eachof the following eight years they will pay an increased share (togetherwith the balances from the previous years) until in 1967-68 100 per cent,of the grant is paid in the year to which it relates.
