^-IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(5S) Z61 C0FY N0. V*L20th December, 195SCABINETCIVIL, SERVICE pay memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer this memorandum deals with pay claims which have been submittedby the Staff Side of the Civil Service National Whitley Council and by thePost Office Engineering Union.    The Wages Policy Committee have held a number of discussions on this matter and, in view of the potentialimportance of the topic, they have invited me to place it before theCabinet for decision.The Central Pay Claim2.     On 14th October the Staff Side of the Civil Service National whitley council presented their case for a central, settlement covering gradeswithin the arbitrable limit (i. e. , up to and including the level of Principal)in almost all classes of the Civil Service.    (The last general pay increase was granted with effect from June, 1957. )    It is accepted policy that the pay of civil servants should be kept in line with that of people incomparable employment elsewhere;  the Royal Commissionon the Civil Service recommended that this should normally bedone through class by class adjustments, based on fact-findinginvestigations by the Civil Service Pay Research Unit.    It has not,however, as yet proved possible to achieve this objective, since the Unitis still very far from having reviewed the main Civil Service grades.In these circumstances, central pay settlements are necessary to preventthe Service falling appreciably behind comparable outside occupations.3.      The Treasury have collected evidence from a number of outsideundertakings which employ comparable staff.    The essential points ofthis evidence are:-(a)    Of some 52 representative firms and undertakings coveredby the evidence, 25 have given increases which can beregarded as justifying some consequential adjustment inCivil Service pay, and 27 have given no such increases.(b) Of those that have given increases, the average increaseawarded is about 3. 5 per cent.(c) The average increase awarded spread over the wholefield is well under 2 per cent.-1-
4.        It has only been possible to take the most tentative and informal soundings about the likely reactions of the National Staff Side to anyoffer which we might decide to make.    But there are definite indications that an offer of 3 per cent would not be accepted:  the Staff Side&apos;s view isthat a 4 per cent pay round is in process, and they will therefore bedisinclined to settle for less.    It might, however, be possible to reach agreement with them on an offer of 3. 5 per cent, particularly if this weremade effective from 1st December, 1958.5.        A central pay settlement at 3. 5 per cent would cost, in a full year,  14 millions.Post Office Engineers&apos; Claim6.        The Post Office Engineering Union submitted, a few days before14-th October, an independent claim for increases in the pay of their members.    Their claim was based on movements in industry outside theCivil Service, and it seems clear that an increase of 4 per cent is justified on the evidence.7.        A 4 per cent increase to the Post Office engineers would cost 2. 3 millions in a full year.S.        It is the practice of the Post Office Engineering Union to submitits own independent claim, somewhat in advance of other Civil Serviceclaims, since pay movements in outside engineering industries are clearly identifiable and normally take place in advance of pay movementsfor outside clerical workers.    There are thus grounds to support theview that, in logic, it is not reasonable to link a pay offer to the PostOffice engineers with one to the Civil Service as a whole.    In practice,however, if a 4 per cent offer is made to the Post Office engineers, theStaff Side will inevitably press for a 4 per cent award for the Civil Servicegenerally, if only because of the link between the engineers and the CivilService as a whole which is provided by the manipulative workers in thePost Office (who will expect to follow increases granted to the engineers).9.        In our discussions in the Wages Policy Committee, therefore,our objective has been to seek to secure that, on this occasion at any rate,the central pay claim and the claim by the Post Office engineers are settled together and on a similar basis.A Postponed Settlement10.        We have examined a compromise solution under which the staff side would be told that the evidence at present does not justify an offer on the central claim:  the door would be left slightly ajar, and the moderate elements on the Staff Side might thus be able to hold theposition until January or February, when the evidence could bere-examined.11.        For such a tactic to have any chance of success, however, some method needs to be devised to ensure that the Post Office engineersneither receive any offer nor secure an arbitration award.    one possible course would be to indicate to the Post Office Engineering Union-2-
that the Official Side will not in the future be prepared to entertainindependent claims by individual staff associations for general &quot;economic&quot;increases unless they are based on fact-finding.    This would mean either that the Union would have to go to the Pay Research Unit in order that theUnifs previous report might be brought up-to-date, or that they wouldhave to stand in with the central claim.    Even so, this would not preventthe Union from going to arbitration; but, as they are members of theStaff Side, they could hardly do this without consulting other constituentassociations, which would take time.An Immediate Offer12.       The other possible solution which we have examined would be tomake an immediate offer of a 3.5 per cent increase, with effect from 1st December, 1958, in response to both claims.13.       I set out below, in note form, arguments for a postponed settle-ment and for an immediate offer.Case for a Postponed Settlement14.   (a)  The evidence does not itself justify an offer of 3. 5 per cent;over half the firms and undertakings in the sample have given norelevant increase, and the average relevant increase is less thanZ per cent.(b) Any offer now would therefore be partly based on a predictionof what is going to happen to wages and salaries in occupations comparable to the Civil Service;  this could constitute an awkward precedent in thefuture.(c) The Priestley Commission clearly envisaged that the CivilService would follow outside rates in the sense of moving after them;hence the strong hint in favour of some retrospection contained in their recommendations.     Presentationally there is much to be said for attempt-ing to follow the recommendations of the Priestley Commission in favourof class by class settlements after investigation by the Pay ResearchUnit:  central pay settlements by the Civil Service raise more difficultpresentational problems.    In particular, it is not always easy to securepublic acceptance of the thesis that they represent the end of one wageround, rather than the beginning of another.(d) An immediate award to the Civil Service might provide an example which would hasten the completion of the current round of paymovements;  many of the undertakings which have not moved are waiting to see what happens to the Staff Side&apos;s claim for a central settlement.(e) Some employers (particularly the Local Authorities, whohave a claim before them which we understand it is their present intention to resist) will say that the Governments decision to make an award to the Civil Service makes inevitable an increase in the pay oftheir employees, with consequent increases in rates, etc.    An award might also have repercussions on other parts of the non-industrial public sector, e. g. , the National Health Service.
(f)  There can be no certainty that an immediate offer of 3. 5 per cent would be accepted.Cas-e for an Immediate Offer15.   (a)  The evidence shows that a movement of the order of 3. 5 per centis now half completed in the field of employment comparable with theCivil Service; this could therefore be regarded as sufficient to justify animmediate offer, provided the Staff Side were given clearly to understandthat on this occasion they were in the middle of the queue.    It is, more-over, possible that the evidence gathered by the Treasury does not fullyreflect real improvements in remuneration in outside sectors since 1st July, 1957:  it might be argued that, in fact, these have been nearer3. 5 per cent than, say, 2 per cent.(b) This movement is likely to be completed during the first halfof 1959.    Even, therefore, if the Staff Side accepted deferment of their claim for the moment, it is almost certain that in the first half of nextyear the Government will be forced into a central pay settlement at ahigher figure;  and since there will then be great pressure for retrospection,m^be even to 1st January, the financial gain from delay is doubtful.(c) The latest information suggests that, largely owing to themovement of food prices, the retail price index is likely to rise during thefirst half of next year from its present figure of 110 to 112 or 113.    Ifthis proves to be the case, we may well be faced with a Civil Service pay settlement of, say, 5 or 6 per cent, at a particularly embarrassing time.(The retail price index stood at 106 in June, 1957, when the last generalpay increase was granted to the Service.)   A settlement now, with anexplicit indication to the Staff Side that on this occasion they are nearer the middle than the end of the queue, should give us a good chance of holding the position until about the end of next year, even if the forecastincreases in the retail price index materialise.(d) Now that the 1958 wage movement is virtually completed inthe industrial field, there is everything to be said for hastening thecompletion of the corresponding movement among salaried workers;  then the overlapping of the 1958 movement into 1959 will be avoided.    Thepossible developments referred to at (c) above lend greater emphasisto this point.(e) If an immediate offer is not made, it is probable that theNational Staff Side will not be able to hold the constituent staff associations;  the latter will pursue independent claims based on thegeneral movement in wages and salaries (the strongest cases probablybeing put forward first) and at least some are likely to succeed beforethe Arbitration Tribunal.    The effect of a series of ad hoc settlementsand awards for civil servants in the first half of 1959 might havedisastrous consequences for the policy of wage restraint; and theeffect on Civil Service pay structure could be chaotic.
(f) If an immediate offer is not to be made, the Post Office will have great difficulty in holding the position with the Post Office EngineeringU ion;  the grades which that Union represents have undoubtedly a good case on the merits for something of the order of 4 per cent, and they will get very restive if they are faced with what is in effect a nil offer pendingfact-finding.(g) The Coleraine Committee is at present reviewing the pay of thehigher Civil Service.    We have no indication of what their recommenda-tions might be;  but in view of the changes which have taken place outside(and inside) since these higher rates of pay were last settled, thepossibility cannot be excluded that they will report, perhaps early in theNew Year, in favour of substantial increases for the higher Civil Service.This would be very embarrassing for the Government if a much smallerincrease for the middle and lower grades was still being refused;  on theother hand, if a central pay award had already been made, the ColeraineCommittee could and probably would say that their recommendations asregards the higher Civil Service took account of it.Conclusion16.       In the light of the above considerations, the majority of the wages policy Committee feel that the best course would be to seek to secure animmediate settlement by offering an increase of 3. 5 per cent in response to both claims, preferably before the end of this month: this will tendto increase the chances of the offer being regarded as consequentialupon the current wage round rather than as setting the pace for the nextone.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S.
