THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1958C. (-58)- 226 Copy No. %28th October, 1958CABINETINTERNATIONAL BANK AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND:ANNUAL MEETINGNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer this year&apos;s meeting of the Board of Governors of the International monetary fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, held in new Delhi, was of more than usual interest and importance. My colleagues willknow that since the beginning of the year we have been impressing upon theUnited States Administration the need for an increase in international liquidity.Pressure on the President (Mr. Eisenhower) was applied personally by the PrimeMinister in June and eventually they were persuaded of this. The Presidentinstructed the United States Governor in a published letter dated 26th August,1958, to make proposals for increases not only in the resources of the international monetary Fund but also in the resources of the International Bank. As themeeting of the Fund and the Bank followed closely upon the Commonwealth Tradeand Economic Conference, and took place in the capital city of one of the largestof the underdeveloped countries of the world, the economic growth and progressof the less developed areas of the world, in which both Bank and Fund have a vital and expanding role to play, naturally became its dominant theme.2. The initiative of the United States Governor was strongly backed by theUnited Kingdom and received general support, and the Executive Boards of bank and Fund were instructed to prepare detailed proposals for increases in their resources, having regard to the views expressed by the Governors. I said that inmy view Fund quotas should be generally increased by 50 per cent. In one ortwo exceptional instances (notably Germany) there might be a case for a larger increase and these should be examined. The question of the gold payment wouldalso need to be examined; for our part we should expect to pay in gold 25 per cent,of our increased quota of $650 millions in accordance with the provisions of theArticles.3. As for the International Bank, the Paymaster-General said that in ourview its capital should be doubled. We hoped, however, that the Bank&apos;s operations would be so managed that the additional capital would all remain uncalled and form a base for borrowing by the Bank in world markets (mainly New York).4. These increases in the resources of the two important international institutions will play an important part in our general policy in encouraging steadyeconomic growth in the world.5. An increase of 50 per cent, in International Monetary Fund quotas wouldgive us total drawing rights of nearly $2 billions (of which we have at presentdrawn about $540 millions and have a stand-by for a further $760 millions).Payment of 25 per cent, of the increase in gold would cost about $275 millions forthe whole of the sterling area (about $160 millions for the United Kingdom alone).We should probably have to find most of the gold for the whole sterling area butwe should be paid for it in sterling by the other members of the sterling area. Ourown contribution would require legislation but would be below the line in theBudget. In the case of the International Bank the proposal is in effect to increase54245
the uncalled capital and we should have to put no money down; we should simplyincrease our liability in the event of the Bank being wound up.6. Both the Paymaster and I emphasised the need for speed. I am confident that these are the increases which will eventually be approved by the governors and I hope that the Bank and Fund will be working with their increased resourcesby the time of the next Annual Meeting.7. In due course legislation to give effect to the changes in our Fund quotaand our Bank subscription will be necessary.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,27th October, 1958.
