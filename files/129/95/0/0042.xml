&apos; SECRET * 228(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 242 COPY NO.24th November, 1958CABINETINTEGRATION OF N.A.T.O. AIR defence memorandum by the Minister of defence at present, the air defence of the European North atlantic treaty Organisation (N.A.T.n.) countries is the responsibility of theindividual national Governments.2. With the speed and range of modern aircraft and theintroduction of anti-aircraft missiles and of a co-ordinated early warning system this arrangement is militarily quite unsound; the air defence ofEurope must in future be treated as a whole.3. The Supreme Allied Commander  Europe (SACEUR) has there fore proposed the establishment of an integrated air defence system under which N.A.T.O. Europe would be formed into four regions, ofwhich this country would be one.4. Logistic support, administration and discipline would continueto be a national responsibility, as it is for other forces such as theBritish Army of the Rhine which are in a similar position.5. Politically the proposal has advantages in that it is a practicalstep forward in European co-operation and an indication that Europemust be defended as a whole or not at all.   It also has disadvantages inthat it requires countries to abrogate their sovereignty to some extent in an area of special sensitivity.6. The Defence Committee considered the proposal on20th November (D.(58) 27th Meeting, Minute 2) and concluded that on bothdefence and political grounds it was desirable to accept the plan ofSACEUR in principle, but that further consideration should be given to theform in which the safeguards in the plan for national, as distinct from.A.T.O. , interests were expressed.   The question how the proposal could best be presented to the public, in view of the delicate political considerations which it involves, was also raised.   I have given further consideration to these matters, in consultation with theForeign Secretary.7. The safeguards to SACEUR&apos;s plan, which have been designedto meet the difficulties that we saw in his original proposals, are set out in full at the annex to this paper, together with the definitionsof &quot;Operational Command&quot;, &quot;Operational Control&quot; and &quot;TacticalControl&quot;.    I am satisfied that these safeguards are fully adequate fortheir purpose and that there would be nothing to be gained, and perhaps a good deal to be lost, by attempting to propose any change of substanceto them at this stage.   In effect, the only authority given to SACEUR
is in peacetime to make operational plans for the use of air defence forces assigned to him, and in wartime to make the best use of the totalforces available;  in both cases inis authority is subject to the safeguards,of which the principal ones are those in paragraph 2 (a), (c) and (f)of the Annex.8. If the proposals are adopted by the N,A,T.O. Council they aresure to receive publicity, and the form and timing of the presentation of them in this country will need careful consideration.   In general, Ittiink we should seek to emphasise how little difference in practice theplan is likely to make to the arrangements for United Kingdom air defence and the position of Fighter Command.   I give below a brief outline of the way in which the case might be presented -(i)  The strength of N.A.T.O. and the security of all the countries of the Alliance is based on collective defence and interdependence.In no field is collective defence more important than in air defence.Y/ith the speed and range of modern aircraft and with the introductionof missiles an   air defence system organised on a solely national basisno longer makes any sense.(ii)  The plan therefore provides for the welding of existing national air defence systems in N.A.T.O. Europe into an integratedsystem.   Within the framework of this collective defence the vital interests of the particular countries concerned are fully protected by certain safeguards.   The most important are:-(a) that the size and composition of the forces provided by each country will remain at the discretion of thecountry concerned:(b) the assigned air defence units will normally be deployedon the territory of their own country and onlyelsewhere with the approval of the government concerned:(c) the choice of the targets to be defended by theair defence forces of the particular country willcontinue to be at the discretion of the Governmentof the country.(iii)  Subject to these national safeguards, the plan will enableSACEUR to make operational plans for the use of the air defence forcesassigned to him which will provide for the most effective defenceof the European N.A.T.&quot;&apos;. area as a whole, and a better defence foreach of the countries concerned than any could provide from its own resources.9. It is necessary that the Chief of the Defence Staff shouldbe in a position to state the views of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to theMilitary Committee of N.A.T.O. on 25th November.   The DefenceCommittee have already agreed that it is desirable on both defence andpolitical grounds to accept SAGEUR&apos;s proposals in principle.   I am satisfied that there is nothing to be gained by seeking to modifySACEUR&apos;s plan as it now stands, and that it should be possible to present it acceptably to Parliament and the public,   I therefore recommendthat:-2-
(a) the Chief of the Defence Staff should be instructedto make it clear to SAC EUR that it is the policyof Her Maj esty&apos;s Government -(i) to confine such fighter and missile defence as may be provided in Britain to thedefence of the deterrent and the interception of intruders;(ii) to reduce progressively the fighter forcein the United Kingdom; and(iii) to deploy missile defence on an experimentalscale only until further experience hasbeen gained.(b) subject to^confirmation from SACEUR that he will not seek to upset the above policy, the Chief of theDefence Staff should be authorised to supportSACEUR&apos;s plan as it now stands at the meetingof the Military Committee on 25th November;(c) that further consideration should be given to the formand timing of the method of presenting the plan toParliament and the public, on the assumption thatit is eventually approved by the N.A.T.O. Council.D.S.Ministry of Defence, S0W.l.24th November, 1958-3
SECRETANNEXTHE INTEGRATION OF AIR DEFENCE INN.A.T.P. EUROPE(Extracts from a NA.T.O. Military Committee Paper -M.C.54/1)1. Three other definitions are also relevant and are as follows:-(a) Operational Command is the authority granted to a Commanderto assign missions or tasks to subordinate Commanders, to deploy units,to re-assign forces and to retain or delegate operational and/or tacticalcontrol as may be deemed necessary.   It does not, of itself, includeadministrative command or logistical responsibility.(b) Operational Control is the authority granted to a Commanderto direct forces assigned so that the Commander may accomplish specificmissions or tasks which are usually limited by function, time or location;to deploy units concerned, and to retain or assign tact ical control ofthose units.  It does not include authority to assign separate employment or components of the units concerned.   Neither does it, of itself, includeadministrative or logistical control.(c) Tactical Control is the detailed and usually local, direction and control of movements or manoeuvres necessary to accomplish missionsor tasks assigned.Responsibilities and Safeguards2. In order to safeguard national interests and to clarify Alliedresponsibilities, the following principles should be established and agreed:(a) National air defence units assigned to SACEUR will be placed under his operational command and control in peace and war, subjectto such restriction as may be imposed in respect of employment and deployment of forces.(b) Assigned air defence forces will not be used for tasks otherthan air defence without national approval.(c) Assigned air defence units will, in general, be deployed in national territory unless exceptions to meet overall requirementsreceive national approval.(d) The composition of Allied air defence staffs at eachlevel should take into account the nationality and service of the forces and facilities contributed.(e) Control and reporting centers and stations will be mannedprimarily by the nation in whose territory they are located unlessunusual circumstances demand otherwise, and then only after approvalof the nations concerned.
(f) The provision of national force contributions will follow the already established procedures (i. e. Supreme Allied CommanderEurope will continue to make his recommendations to the StandingGroup for the Military Committee), but the decision on the size andshape of the forces to be provided, and their equipment, will remain as at present a national responsibility.(g) The logistical support of assigned units will remain a national responsibility.(h) Administration and discipline of personnel assigned to allied organizations will remain a responsibility of the nation concerned.(i) The Allied air defence organization will continue to providethe information normally supplied by national air defence authorities for all matters which remain national in character.   This will includeinformation which is necessary from military authorities  for thenational control of -(1)- Civil Aviation(2)  Civil Defence(3)  Other national responsibilities.(j) Certain functions such as internal security and nationalcommitments outside of N*A.T/&quot;*., must remain a nationalresponsibility.   Should circumstances require the employment ofnational forces for such purposes, the necessary forces inclusive of personnel and equipment may be withdrawn from the assignedforces by the nation concerned under the currently agreed procedures.(k) To ensure that Allied commanders responsible for air defence have the required degree of authority to discharge theirAllied responsibilities, it is essential that commanders at each levelbe responsible only to superior Allied authorities for matters whichare Allied.    If it is essential that an Allied commander undertakecertain additional administrative functions or responsibilities ofa purely national character, direction and control must be purelyAllied for Allied matters and purely national for national matters.(l) The inclusion of the Faeroe Islandks in Supreme allied commander Europe area of responsibility for air defence would be without jeopardy to the use of the facilities thereon by the supreme allied Commander Atlantic in pursuance of his airborne early warningand anti-submarine warfare responsibilities.   The commander of facilities in the Faeroe Islands jointly supporting the Supreme allied commander Europe and Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic, wouldhave equal responsibility to Supreme Allied Commander Atlanticin connection with the control and direction of airborne early warningand anti-submarine warfare operations as he has to the supreme allied Commander Europe in connection with the integrated air defence.-2-
3. Significant changes of plan, redeployment offerees,changes in states of preparedness and similar matters which havean administrative, financial, or other implications which are mattersof national responsibility, will invariably require the concurrenceat appropriate level of the nation concerned prior to the issueof implementing orders by the Allied headquarters concerned.-3-
