C.(58) 236 COPY NO15th November, 1958CABINETCANCELLATION OF GERMAN DEFENCEORDERSMemorandum by the Minister of defence at the Prime Minister&apos;s request I circulate the annexed note on the recent cancellation of defence orders by the Federal GermanGovernment.D.S.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1.14th November, 1958.SUFPLY OF THE HISPANO SUIZA ARMOURED PERSONNELCARRIER (H.S.30) TO germany in February, 1957, the Federal German Government placed anorder for 2,800 armoured personnel carriers with the British manufacturing and Research Company (B.M.A.R.C.), a British subsidiary of the Swiss firmof Hispano Suiza.    B.MA.R.C., having no capacity for heavy engineering,sub-contracted the major part of the order to Messrs. Leyland,s MotorsLimited.   The Germans placed a separate contract with Messrs. Rolls RoyceLimited for engines for the vehicles to be produced in Britain and for a further,650 vehicles of the same type ordered from a group of German firms.The orders placed in Britain are believed to amount in value to some 63 millions.2. On 23rd August, 1958, Herr Strauss, the Federal German Ministerof Defence, informed B.M.A.R.C. that the Federal German Governmentwere cancelling 1,800 of the 2,800 vehicles ordered from them.    no publicity was given to this decision until 7th November when Herr Straussannounced it in the Bundestag.    It had been the British understanding until recently that the order with Messrs. Rolls Royce was not affected becauseRolls Royce engines would be fitted wherever the vehicles were produced.There are indications now that this may not be the case.3. From the very beginning, Her Majesty&apos;s Government had seriousdoubts about the wisdom of placing such a large order for a vehicle of advanced design for which no complete drawings existed and of which no-1-(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
prototype had undergone development trials.    These fears were voicedinformally to individual members of the British and German subsidiaries ofHispano Suiza.    But, because it was a contract in which Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment were not involved, there is no record that any advice was offered to the German authorities.    Because Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere not a party to the contract and because it was known that the decisionto cancel was closely bound up with German domestic politics, it wasdecided that the decision to cancel the contract should not be directlychallenged.    To protect British interests generally, and those of messrs. Leyland&apos;s inparticular, an Aide-Memoire was left with the federal german Foreign Ministry on 29th September.    This expressed concern atthe reduction of the order, requested reasons for the decision, and askedwhether it was intended to reinstate the order in due course.    The ForeignMinistry promised to consult the Federal German Ministry of Defence andto let the Embassy know their views.4. No formal reply to the Aide-Memoire has yet been received.Herr Von Scherpenberg, the Permanent Head of the Foreign Ministry, told the Foreign Secretary on 23rd October that, as soon as the german authorities had had satisfactory experience with the 1,000 vehicles remain-ing on order, they would be prepared to reinstate the full order in Britain with messrs. L,eyland&apos;s. More recently, H. M. Ambassador at E on n has reportedconversations with Dr. Rust, the Permanent Head of the Federal GermanDefence Ministry, and with Dr. Adenauer, the German Federal Chancellor,in which they said much the same thing.   &apos;5. The German authorities have been at no pains to disguise theirpresent dislike of Hispano Suiza and their British subsidiary.    They havemade it clear that they have a high opinion of Messrs. Leyland&apos;s. We haveno proof that there has been any collaboration between the Germans andMessrs. Leyland&apos;s,but officials who have been in touch with representativesof Messrs. L,eyland&apos;s have not found them unduly disturbed by cancellations.The Ministry of Supply have agreed in principle to a German request to inspect the vehicle when it is produced.    They have also agreed to testthe vehicle for Messrs. Lieyland&apos;s at the Fighting Vehicle Research andDevelopment Establishment at Chobham.6. It is known that the German Defence Ministry officials concernedwith finance are anxious to see the order reinstated in Britain.    This is because the Head of the Finance Branch, as the official responsible for theDefence Budget, has to defend the financial clauses of the Support CostsAgreement in the Bundestag and to set the  50 millions deposit for armspurchases against specific items.    If the balance of the order is placedelsewhere than in Britain, this will be difficult to do.7. The British chances of recapturing part of the order dependprima facie on the firms concerned (in practice Messrs. Leyland&apos;s) producingit in a form which will satisfy the Germans.    It is, of course, always opento the Germans to justify on military grounds a decision taken for political reasons.    We should, however, be on our guard against their claiming thatthe vehicle does not match up to requirements for which it was not designed and which were  not even in contemplation at the time it was ordered.    this makes the test at Chobham particularly important, since it will be related to the roles originally specified and not to any which have been allocated to it since.-2-
8. Notwithstanding the German financial difficulties mentioned inparagraph 6 above, we have consistently maintained that the status of theorder for the Hispano Suiza vehicle has no bearing on their obligations under the Support Costs Agreement.    We do not know the terms of theHispano Suiza contract and the financial implications of a German failure to reinstate the order cannot at present be clearly assessed.    But it isthought likely that the loss to Britain would be of the order of  25 millions to  30 millions.    If cancellation charges are not recovered it may be as high as  35 millions.    These figures take no account of any effect thatthe cancellation may have on the orders placed with Messrs. Rolls Royce.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1.14th November, 1958.-3-
