SECRET &quot;T\&quot;.^THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT&quot; ---      -- r     jjgPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1959C. (59) 70 Copy No.     5017th April, 1959CABINETLIBERALISATION OF DOLLAR imports memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at Montreal last September the President of the Board of Trade, afterannouncing a number of immediate measures of liberalisation, outlined the futureprogramme as follows:  &quot; The next move will be to make a start in freeing our imports of consumer goods and the remaining foodstuffs. Exactly what we shall be ableto do and when will depend on certain well-known conditions. I have inmind the need to be sure both that world trade is expanding and that we are free from inflation at home.But broadly speaking this is what we would propose to do. All beingwell we hope to make a start next year. First, we should remove the controls on as wide a range of consumer goods and foodstuffs as we could. Secondly,we should establish, or increase, quotas for items where, in our judgment,the cost of total liberalisation might be greater than we could afford at thattime. The next stage would be progressively to increase these quotas untilthe items were completely free. Thirdly, there would remain a limited numberof items presenting special difficulties. Each of these would be consideredover a period of time on merits.&quot;2. The Economic Policy Committee have been considering the steps to betaken to give effect to this pledge. It is proposed to liberalise a wide range of consumer goods, including foodstuffs, at present liberalised from Western Europewhere the net cost of additional imports is expected to be comparatively small many items negligible and none apart from books and periodicals costing morethan  1 million. In addition it is proposed that the United States and Canadashould have access to existing quotas for Western Europe and other sources ofsupply. These quotas would be enlarged so that Western Europe would not beable to complain that we were reducing their trade with us. Finally, some increases are proposed for existing dollar quotas and one new dollar quota canned meat is suggested. The total cost of additional imports is not likely to exceed 17 millions. Switches from the sterling area to other sources of supply shouldbe less than  500,000. We think it would be desirable at the same time to offer to negotiate with Japan on a number of items in which they have a trading interestwith us. The Committee have considered the proposals in detail, and I do notthink my colleagues need be concerned with them.3. At the same time it will be necessary to give greater freedom to the colonies in their import licensing from the dollar area and it is intended to allow them to import dollar goods with the same freedom as they import from the organisation for European Economic Co-operation area. (There is no satisfactory intermediatestep.) This may lead to some switch from the United Kingdom as a source ofsupply and might affect our balance of. payments up to perhaps  5 millions a year.55060
Economic considerations . There is no reason for refusing to allow people to buy from Canada andthe United States (the one a Commonwealth country, the other our principal ally)goods which they can buy freely from, say, France and Germany, at a time whensterling acquired by France and Germany can be freely converted into dollars.5. The step is not a concession to the United States and Canada. It is carrying-put a long-standing international commitment and a specific pledge made at montreal. We have been and shall be under continuing pressure to do it; boththe Canadian Prime Minister and the President of the United States raised thesubject with the Prime Minister and there have been a number of other approachesby the United States both in London and Washington. We shall certainly be pressed both in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) session inMay and at the meeting of Commonwealth officials immediately before it to say what we intend to do. Moreover, discussion is already beginning about the timing of a general move from the transitional post-war provisions of the international monetary Fund to the permanent provisions under which countries will not beentitled to maintain discriminatory restrictions on trade and current payments.We shall not be able to defer this move for long and we should not wish to seeother countries (e.g., Germany) make it before us. But we should like to do thenecessary removal of discrimination against dollar imports in stages.6. Given the small cost of what is proposed in relation to our total trade andthe small fraction of this cost for each individual item I feel sure that we ought tomake the move.Political and Other Considerations7. Nevertheless the change is liable to lead to political misunderstanding.Both the Opposition and some of our own back-benchers still think in terms of&quot; dollar scarcity &quot; though this is something which disappeared from economicreality some time ago and over the years 1953-56 there was a net outflow of funds from the United States averaging $1^ billions a year; in 1958 the outflow was about$3 billions and it is expected to be much the same in 1959. Moreover, an increasing proportion of the aid made available by the United States to the rest of the worldis being spent on foreign goods (whereas in fiscal 1955, 79 per cent, was spent on united States goods, in the first half of fiscal 1959 it was only 47 per cent.). Thereis talk about the weakness of the dollar. The danger is that the United States maytry to rectify their position by steps which will be damaging to our own trade, andthe right course will be for us to continue to urge on them the importance of expanding and freeing world trade,8. Public opinion may look askance at a liberalisation of imports from theUnited States at a time when they have appeared to be damaging our trade (e.g.,restriction of oil imports, the Decca navigational aid problem, the wool tariff andtendering for public contracts). The fact, however, is that the policy of the UnitedStates Administration has on the whole been very liberal; it is only the exceptionsthat receive comment. Moreover, the measures taken by the United States havebeen of general application and not directed solely against us, whereas ourdiscrimination is directed solely against the United States and Canada. If we continue to restrict imports from the United States in a discriminating way itstrengthens the hands of those in the United States who want to impose restrictionson trade and weakens our friends there who want to continue liberal policies.9. Our restrictions against the United States are far greater than their ownrestrictions. We have a wide area of trade where there are no quotas at all and asubstantial area still on quota whereas they have, apart from a range of agricultural products in which we have little interest, very few restrictions (oil, lead, zinc andwool fabrics). An interesting case is motor cars where, our exports in 1958 to theUnited States were worth  63 millions with  19 millions to Canada whereas wewere only prepared to license the import of 650 cars from North America, In factonly 203 came in from the United States (value  260,000) and 188 from Canada.It is quite extraordinary that the American motor industry should have toleratedthe inroad which we have made on their domestic market while we have beenrestricting their market here; the fact that at present they are not even able to sell the very small number of cars which we allow them to send is regarded by the americans as a reason for general suspicion of our intentions, since clearly thecomplete removal of the quota would be very unlikely to damage our own industry.
10. The United States Economic Minister in London has now told theParliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade that the Americans are proposing totake three steps (a) a reassessment of their basis for tendering for public works contracts whichwill give much better opportunities to the United Kingdom;(b) to send over a representative to negotiate about the Decca navigationalaids; &apos;(c) to adjust the wool tariff quota arrangements in a way which will assist theUnited Kingdom.The President of the Board of Trade is to see the American Ambassador on Monday,20th April, to seek to confirm that this is so. If it is, it is a most desirabledevelopment which we should do everything in our power to encourage and it wouldseem to remove a political difficulty which has raised doubts about the wisdom offurther liberalisation of our own dollar imports.Conclusion11. I believe that failure to carry out our obligations by removing existingdiscrimination against Canada and the United States would be a false step not onlycontrary to our economic interest, but having grave repercussions on our relationswith the United States, on which so much of our policy depends, and with Canada,a member of the Commonwealth divided from the rest by quota discriminationfor twenty years. I therefore conclude that, if the talk between the President ofthe Board of Trade and the American Ambassador confirms the information whichhas been given to the Parliamentary Secretary of the Board of Trade, v/e should take further steps to liberalise our dollar imports on the lines indicated in this paper.We should, of course, need to consult other members of the Commonwealth andthe Colonies in the ordinary way, but I should like to get this done in order thatour policy may be announced before the G.A.T.T. session in May. Otherwisewe shall find ourselves exposed to severe criticism which it will not be possibleto answer effectively.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,16th April, 1959.
