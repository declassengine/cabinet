The;Subcommittee vfrhichxonducted:the.exammatioii was not. a strongone, and&apos; their report, on&apos; which! the-Treasury: must now;sead in their observations,is not&apos;in truth a very valuable dcorment. Many ofi their, comments and criticismsare based on misapprehension or lack of perspective, some are inconsistent with each&apos; other, and some are unsupported by :the -evidence which they received.Thereiwill: be no difficOlty about Tnakmg appropriate&apos;observations on these in theordinary way.3. I should like, however, to consult my colleagues about the answer to begiven to one particular recommendation, which forms the last sentence of thereport (there is no summary of recommendations), and which attracted considerable attention in the Press:  &quot; They recommend that a small independent Committee, which shouldhave access to Cabinet Papers, be appointed to report upon the theory and practice of Treasury control of expenditure.&quot;4. This recommendation did not really emerge from the evidence. It was put to two of the Sub-Committee&apos;s witnesses, both of whom advised against it,but the Treasury &quot;witnesses were not told of the idea, and their evidence on it wasnot sought. I understand that it was something of an afterthought.5. It was obvious that an outside Committee could not propeny be givenaccess to Cabinet Papers. But I have carefully considered whether an outsideCommittee or Commission could usefully be appointed: I have reached theconclusion that this would be a mistake.6. First, I think it is clear that any thorough examination of financial controlmust range beyond Treasury control in its limited sense. It would have to take account also of Parliamentary control, because that determines a good deal of the framework within which Treasury control has to operate. It would also have toconsider financial control exercised by Departments themselves, for the control ofexpenditure is in fact a matter of partnership between the Treasury and the spendingDepartments, and neither partners role can sensibly be considered in isolation fromthat of the other. I do not think that the House of Commons would be willing that an outside Committee, however knowledgeable and distinguished, should begiven the task of reviewing Parliamentary procedure in financial matters. Changesin Parliamentary procedure have always been regarded as the business cf the Houseitself, though the initiative for changes has often been taken by the Governmentof the day. Nor do I think that an outside Committee could, within a reasonable time, review all the financial processes of the Treasury and the spendingCONFIDENTIAL54907
^S^tartmorits.  Ahimrriertsi8:i%(^^yabpW&apos;*would be necessary to provide them?wipe information fromi whiclv to start their &quot;review, and I doubt if they wouldever really get inside the subjects7.   Again, the control of; Government expenditure is very largely a matter ofGovernment policy, and it is hot possible to form a judgment on the efficacy ofthe Governmenfs control of finance without considering the relations betweenJ^nisters and the processes of interdepartmental discussion at all levels up to thatVCthe Cabinet itself^ from which-financial decisions emerge.  None of this seemsto me proper matter for an outside Committee.8. Nevertheless, a flat negativeitp the Estimate Committees recommendationwould not be likely to have-a^ gp0d5rfeeption, either in Parliament or in the Press,particularly since many of ^thelr^ minor recommendations are also unacceptable.And indeed, I believe that a^fevie^pf. the Governmenfs control of expenditure would be a worth-whileundiortalidngV,This review should, I think, be conductedinternally by the Government-itself.; A considerable effort would be needed, bothin the Treasury and in the spendingDepartments, and I think it would be right to enlist the help, on a confidential basis, of one or two outside persons with suitableexperience such for instance asl1Sir Jeremy Raisman. A retired permanent secretary might be enlisted to direct work at the official level.9. From this work would.emerge a;report, or series of reports, to Ministers,ranging over the whole subject of financial control, not excluding the possibilityof alterations in - Parliamentary procedure. These reports would not be designed for publication, but from them might be distilled, if Ministers saw fit, a White Paperdescribing such measures as the Government decided to adopt.10. If my colleagues agree, I would propose that the Treasury&apos;s observations on the Estimate Committee&apos;s Report should conclude with an indication that, whilethe Government do not accept the Estimate Committee&apos;s recommendation in theform in which it was made, they are nevertheless undertaking a general review ofexisting practice and procedures in the control of expenditure (going wider thanmere Treasury control) with the advice and assistance of one or two outside people whose qualifications and experience would enable them to make a valuable contribution to these problems; and that they will report the results of this reviewto Parliament in due course.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,16th March, 1959.CONFIDENTIAL
