Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1959C. (59) 90 Copy No.    8 326th May, 1959CABINETFUEL POLICY-THE COAL PROBLEMMemorandum by the Minister of power on 19th December, 1958, I submitted to the Cabinet a paper (C. (58) 258)summarising discussions in the Economic Policy Committee on the subject of fuel policy problems.2. I reported that our present fuel policy is broadly based on freedom of choice for the consumer and equality of opportunity for the producer. The freecompetition between the fuels which this policy permits has the great advantageof promoting increased efficiency in the production and use of fuel and, inconsequence, lower manufacturing costs in industry.3. This policy has recently been stated in Parliament in the course of fueldebates. The National Union of Mineworkers and the Opposition continue tocall for a national fuel policy. What they mean is a policy to protect the coalindustry.4.   They state their fuel policy comprises the following:  (i) A tax on fuel oil.(ii) Nationalisation of coal distribution.(iii) Intensification of scientific research in the use of coal and the inclusionof a wider range of coals for use in smokeless zones.(iv) Reduction in opencast mining operations.(v) Halting power station conversion from coal to oil burning.(vi) Re-examination of the programme for nuclear power stations.5. I am bringing the matter to the attention of my colleagues again becauseof a recent approach by the Chairman of the National Coal Board who hithertohas expressed himself as fully in support of the need for the coal industry to makeitself competitive with the alternative fuels oil, electricity and gas.6. He has submitted a proposal either that he should raise the price of coal for sale in Scotland by 5s. 9d. per ton, and reduce the price of East Midland smallcoals for sale in the south of England, and Durham gas coals by 5s. Od. a ton; or,if this is not acceptable, the reduction in price he suggests should be compensatedby procuring an agreement with the Oil Companies to halt the further entry of oilinto coal markets for a period of two years.7. The following table shows the total inland demand for fuel and the share in demand of coal, oil, nuclear and hydro power:  Total primary fuel demand        Shares of Nuclear and(million tons coal equivalent     coal       oil hydro powerpercent, percent.       percent.1938 ... 189 93 7 -1950 ... 225 90 10 -1957 ... 247 :84 15 11958 ... 248 80 19 1SECRETTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
8. It will be seen that since 1938 the percentage of coal to the total has dropped from 93 per cent, to 80 per cent., and the percentage of oil has risen from 7 per cent,to 19 percent.9. The following table illustrates the growth of oil imports, home consumption and exports over the same period: -Imports Home consumption Exports and bunkers(million tons)          (million ions) (million tons)1938 ...      ... 11-7 - 9 0 1-91950 ...      ... 19-2 .15-3 3-41957.....    ... 38-9 24-7 9-71958 ...... 45-1 31-0 12-210.

In 1957 there were indications that supply was beginning to outrundemand and measures were taken in that year and in the early months of 1958 to counteract this. Imports, which had been running at over 5 million tons in 1956,were stopped, recruitment was limited so that the labour force was reduced from710,000 at the end of 1&apos;957 to 687,000 at the end of 1958, and Saturday workingwas stopped as from April 1958. Towards the end of last year an estimate wasmade that, as a result of these measures, production in 1959 would be reduced to209 million tons. and total consumption (inland and exports) was estimated at200 million tons. In order to bring these figures into balance it was proposed i       (i) To close uneconomic pits, 3 million tons.(ii) To cut opencast production by 25 per cent., 3 million tons.(iii) To add to stocks, 3 million tons. ....The effect of this would have been to reduce production in 1959 to 203 million tons.13. This estimate has since had to be revised owing to the continuing increasein the rate of output per man shift, which has risen from T23 tons during 1957 to1-32 at the end of 1958 and T34 to-day. The estimate of demand remains at 200 million tons (though the Coal Board now regard this figure as a maximumand it assumes an early increase of industrial activity), but their estimate of total production in 1959 is now 207-209 million tons instead of 203 million tons. they expect opencast production to be reduced to 11 million tons as planned, but they now estimate deep-mined production at 196-198 million tons instead of192 million tons.14. The amount of additional stocking which will be necessary this year istherefore likely to be of the order of 7 to 9 million tons instead of the estimated
3 million tons. At this date the Coal Board had 24 million tons of coal in stock.The problem of coal stocks is a growing one, and unless there is an early changein demand the above-mentioned figures could be exceeded. In that case further measures to reduce output, both in deep-mined pits and on opencast sites, will be essential.15. Against the above background we have to examine whether any degreeof protection of the coal industry is justified, or whether we are facing an economicchange which will have to be borne in the best interests of efficiency and progress.16. It has been suggested that a market for a fixed amount of coal production should be guaranteed, i.e., the coal industry should have some measure of special protection like the agricultural industry. This is not a course I can commend.17. I propose to examine some of the proposals put forward by the NationalUnion of Mineworkers in their statement of a national fuel policy. ;&apos;18. Their main proposal is to restrict the use of oil, and they suggest a tax on fuel oil. Oil provided only 7 per cent, of our total fuel needs in 1938. By 1958,its share had grown to 19 per cent.; by 1965 it may be 25 per cent. Oil dominatestransport, is essential to agriculture, and is of growing importance in vital industries such as iron and steel, and engineering. The whole world is becoming moredependent on oil, as in due course it may be on nuclear power. The danger of ourposition is that oil has to be imported, but we are taking out what insurances wecan. We have already a good understanding with the oil industries and with theUnited States Administration for a rapid reorganisation of world supplies in anemergency. We have accumulated substantial stocks of oil in this country, andhave measures in hand to increase them. There is no doubt that the public,industrial and domestic, have been educated to a convenient and labour-savingsource of fuel, and I have little doubt that efforts on our part to curtail the use of oil would be resented. Moreover, before contemplating any such efforts we shouldhave to consider most carefully the likely effects on the competitive efficiency of our industry and on the overseas position of the British oil companies. For these reasons I should at present be strongly opposed to adopting the proposal for a tax on fuel oil.19. Reduction in opencast mining operations. These are being curtailedthis year from 14 million tons to 11 million tons, and the target for the next year&apos;s  6-7 million tons. Opencast mining is the most profitable part of the Coal Board&apos;operations. Nevertheless, it should now be run down as fast as existing contractswill permit. 1962 should see the end of the operation with the exception of theFife Site which will be supplying the Lurgi gas plant being erected there.20. Halting power station conversion from coal to oil burning. The erectionand conversion of oil-burning stations was decided upon some five years ago whenthe coal industry could not undertake the necessary supplies of coal. Long-term contracts were entered into with the oil companies which were intended to replace9 million tons of coal in 1965. The total supply of oil to power stations in 1960will have reached a peak of nearly 8 million tons of coal equivalent, being 13 percent, of the total consumption by the power stations at that time. arrangements have been negotiated for a reduction of the contracted supplies starting in 1960 soas to reduce the total to 6 million tons of coal equivalent by 1965, and a furtherarrangement has been made to postpone for one year from 1959 supplies to theextent of one million tons of coal equivalent. The oil companies have committed themselves to a considerable expense in arranging for these supplies, and any furthercurtailment would raise the question of compensation, but the matter is beingexplored. Despite the oil conversions, the consumption of coal at power stationshas risen from 33 million tons in 1950 to 46 million tons in 1958 and is expectedto go on rising to 56 million tons in 1965.21. Re-examination of the programme for building nuclear power stations.-The economics of this programme are currently being re-examined, but in any eventnuclear power stations will have little effect upon the coal position for the next twoyears. The planned increase in conventional generating capacity between now andthe end of 1966 will in any case be nearly three times the planned increase in the nuclear generating capacity.22. Nationalisation of coal distribution. The distribution of solid fuel is not an organised institution, but it is in the hands of large and small operators competing with each other for business. A nationalised distribution industry has nothing to commend it.
&apos; 23. Intensification of scientific research. Much is being done in thissuggested direction and I have recently appointed two Committees one on CoalDerivatives, and the other on the Production and Distribution of Smokeless Fuels to advise as to the adequacy of our present arrangements, and what further steps, ifany, can be taken.24. If we are not prepared to implement, any further than we have done, theproposals put forward by the National Union of Mineworkers and the Opposition,it seems inevitable that the coal industry must shrink in size.&apos;:&apos;r. 25. The Coal Board in 1956 in their booklet &quot; Investing in Coal&quot; envisageda total demand by 1965 of 240 million tons.26. They have been engaged for some time in reassessing the demand, andconsequently their programme, up to 1965. This reassessment is not yet completed,but I understand that they provisionally assess the total demand in 1965 at210 million tons (including some 10 million tons for exports) after allowing for industrial recovery and increasing demands from the power stations on the one hand,and the encroachment of oil on the other. Over the next year or so it is probablethat the demand (inland and exports combined) will not exceed 200 million tons.27. Provisional indications are that their programme up to 1965 will requirethe closing of 200 pits in five years (100 of which would be from normal exhaustion)during which time 11 new pits would come into operation. It has been announcedthat there will be no further closures in 1959 beyond those already scheduled. Iam asking the Chairman of the Coal Board to let me know his plans for theprogramme of any further necessary closures in 1960 and later years.28. The rationalisation of the industry on these lines should mean that their annual capital expediture would decline from the approved figure of  122 millions in 1959 to  100 millions in 1961 and progressively lower figures in following years,say down to  55 millions by 1965.29. These figures are all provisional, but my own assessment is that this isthe best picture the Coal Board can look for. Indeed, the encroachment of oil andthe increasing efficiency in the use of coal which we have brought about mightwell reduce the demand even below these estimates.30. At the moment the Board have an accumulated deficit of  33 millions and their estimated deficit for the current year was originally  20 millions whichthey have since reduced to  10 millions by virtue of the economies resulting fromthe increased production per man by cutting overheads.31. The Board have no financial reserves and are having to borrow heavilyfrom the Exchequer in order to finance their increasing stocks.32. The Board have for some time been considering ways in which to make their price policy more flexible in order both to safeguard their business againstthe competition of other fuels and to provide a better balance between theprofitable and the unprofitable coalfields.33. At present, to take the cases cited by the Chairman of the Coal Board,Sir James Bowman, the whole of the output of the Scottish Division finds a salein the local market at prices which show an average loss of 14s. Od. per ton, but theEast Midlands Division, which produces at an average profit of 5s. Od. per ton, ishaving to stock coal from current output at a rate which would increase its stocks, if no action is taken, to the equivalent of two months&apos; production by the end of thisyear. There is clearly room for a revision of the present price structure, andSir James Bowman&apos;s proposal for an increase of prices in Scotland balanced by areduction in the prices of East Midlands small coals for sale in the South of Englandis the only proposal he has made to this end.34. But it does not appear to me to be a sound commercial proposition quite apart from the obvious political difficulties to single out one particular area for applying such a policy, and Sir James Bowman has not said that he intends his present proposal to be the fore-runner of similar changes in other areas. I have indicated my views to him in a letter, a copy of which is at Annex A. I havereceived his reply, a copy of which is at Annex B.35. Governmental action in support of a two-year standstill in regard to oildevelopment in industrial and domestic use, as suggested by the Chairman of theNational Coal Board, could have serious repercussions..  It would, I suggest, be
resented at home, and it would have prejudicial effects on the overseas position ofour oil companies.36. We are concerned in the producing countries which supply our markets,and any attempt to restrict development in our markets would probably be met with counter measures which would reduce the profitability of this trade to us.Such measures would also tend to defer the recovery in the affairs of our shippingfleets.37. Decisions may have to be taken before very long about the long-termfuture of the coal industry, but I cannot put final recommendations forward untilI have the National Coal Board&apos;s own reappraisal.38.   In the meantime, I would ask the concurrence of my colleagues (i) In the continuance of our announced policy of freedom of choice for theconsumer and freedom to compete on the part of the producer.(ii) In my informing the Chairman of the National Coal Board (a) That we cannot fully consider the long-term problems of theindustry until we have his reappraisal, but that he cannot look to the Government for support of his proposal for an arrangedlimitation for two years of the home oil market.(b) That we should be willing to consider comprehensive proposals for improving the coal price structure, but that the discriminatoryproposals that he has made do not provide a basis for solving the problem which is likely to prove acceptable.M.Ministry of Power, S.W.1,25th May, 1959.
ANNEX A14th May, 1959.Dear Sir James,&apos;   ;- -I have been considering the papers you left with me on Monday, lith May.We shall be discussing this matter further later in the month, but I thought I wouldlike to let you have my reaction to the proposals for you to consider before we meet.I must express my disappointment at the proposal on Inland Price Adjustmentsas well as grave doubts as to whether it would constitute an efficient instrumentin achieving more sales.My disappointment arises from the fact that after many months of what Iam sure must have been anxious consideration in an attempt to achieve a more flexible sales policy, your proposals should turn out to be for a price increase inone territory-Scotland- and a small reduction in the south of England of EastMidlands small coal, and a small reduction in respect of Durham gas coals.Such a proposal seems to me to be one of &quot; robbing Peter to pay Paul,&quot; andI fear it would appear in this light to your Scottish customers if not to the public as a whole. It has not even the merit of applying generally to all high cost areas the principle, advanced in your memorandum, of making each coalfield pay its way, but it singles out Scotland in what is sure to be regarded as an invidious way./ Further, I would beg leave to question whether a reduction of 5s. a ton, whichI understood you to say you intended to apply to the East Midlands small coal and Durham gas coal, would be a sufficient inducement to meet the competition from oil with which you are faced.So far as the other paper is concerned it has been a source of considerablestrength and much comfort to me to hear you say from time to time that thecoal industry must become competitive if it is to retain its traditional markets.In announcing the Governments policy of freedom of choice to the consumerwhich, as you know, we have done continuously, I have been fortified with the thought of your support in this matter. It was, therefore, somewhat of a shock to me to read your memorandum which you left with me on Monday, proposing that we should arrange to prevent the further entry of oil into markets for aperiod of two years.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) MILLS.Sir James Bowman, K.B.E., J.P.,National Coal Board,Hobart House,Grosvenor Place, S.W.1.
ANNEX BNational Coal Board,,... Hobart House,Grosvenor Place, S.W. 1.21st May, 1959.Dear Minister,Thank you for your letter of 14th May about the proposals we left with youlast week.We, too, are disappointed that, after all our hard work and hard thought, wehave not been able at this time to put forward proposals for price changes of a morefar-reaching kind. The kernel of the problem is that, to compete more effectively,we ought to make widespread reductions in prices. But we have no reserves onthe contrary, we have a substantial accumulated deficit and an obligation to makeends meet on an average of good and bad years.Thus, any proposals we make must be self-balancing; and unless we are to addheavily to our deficit, we can take action only in a quite limited field.It is certainly not the Board&apos;s intention to discriminate unfairly againstScotland, and we do not think that we should be doing so if we increased coal prices in Scotland as we propose. The Board&apos;s policy, declared some years ago,of seeking to make each coalfield pay its way over a period of years must be appliedbroadly. Scottish Division alone of all our Divisions suffered losses (beforecharging interest) on their collieries in 1957, 1958 and in the first quarter of 1959,their losses were 11s. 7d., 14s. 5d. and 9s. 9d. a ton; in the first quarter of 1959, theonly Division besides Scottish to make a loss, before interest, on their collieries wasNorthern, and their loss was only 8d. a ton. So Scottish is the only Division whosecoals could justifiably be increased in price by reference to financial results.You suggest that a reduction of 5s. Od. a ton in the price of East Midlands smallsgoing to the South is inadequate. But the main market for them is for electricitygeneration, and from our discussions with the Central Electricity Generating Boardwe think that such a reduction would have a significant effect on their take of thesecoals. The case of gas coals is more difficult, as you are aware.With regard to the second proposal we left with you, the Board&apos;s policy has been and will be to bring the coal industry on to a basis of economic efficiency. Wehave made an all-out effort to make the industry competitive an effort which has succeeded at least in part. But I would be wrong to hide from you my worry at theimmediate situation. Because of the long-term nature of so much of our investment and its relative inflexibility, the sudden fall in demand is producing grave problems in the short term. We are having to put more coal on the ground even than we expected at the beginning of the year. We must, I submit, have the necessaryelbow-room to phase the closure of pits which are uneconomic and to try to saveother pits which have extensive resources and valuable assets, like the ones in EastDurham. Our proposal was in no sense intended as a protectionist measure to relieveus of our duty to make ourselves fully competitive; we do, on the other hand, ask forjust enough time to bring our productive capacity into line with demand, and soavoid the repercussions in the coalfields of the large-scale closures which may otherwise be inevitable in the next year or two.I hope, in saying this, that we are not being alarmists and that you will agreethat, in this light, our request for Government co-operation is not an unreasonableone. Next year seems bound to be difficult, and our revision of the National Plan,on which we are working hard, will probably imply a large number of closuresphased over the next six years.Yours sincerely,J. BOWMAN.
