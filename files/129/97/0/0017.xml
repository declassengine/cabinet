(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 6711th April, 1959FUTURE STATUS OF THE POST office memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Postmaster-general we have agreed between ourselves the general line of proposals to give the Post Office the commercial freedom of a public corporation whilst retaining direct control by a Minister responsible toParliament.   They are summarised in this paper but are repeatedmore fully and discussed in the Annexes to this paper.2. In 1955 the Government granted a measure of self-containedfinance to the Post Office.   The arrangements were described in the&quot;Report on Post Office Development and Finance&quot; (Cmd. 9576), presented by the present Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster when he wasPostmaster-General.   Commercial,Accounts were to govern Post Officefinancial policy.   The Exchequers claims were limited to  5 millions a year.3. But these changes brought no alteration in parliamentary and accounting procedures in accordance with the concept of the PostOffice as a trading concern.   All revenue is still paid to the Exchequer.All expenditure has to be voted by Parliament in annual Estimates and theTreasury retains, at any rate in theory, its power of control over it.Cash accounts still have to be presented even though they differ widelyfrom the Commercial Accounts and do not reflect the true financialposition of the Post Office.4. These requirements stem from two causes:-(a) since 1787 all Government receipts from taxation or other sources have had to be paid into the Consolidated Fund;(b) no Government expenditure for any purpose can be incurredsave with the specific authority of Parliament.Proposed changes5. The 1955 principles have proved sound.   We suggest theyshould now be taken to their logical conclusion.6. The heart of our proposals is the establishment of a statutoryTrading Fund for the Tost Office. This Fund would be separate fromthe Exchequer. It would be managed by the Postmaster-General, whoalone would be accountable for it to Parliament.   All Post Office revenues-1-COPY NO.cabinet confidential
would be paid into it.   All Post Office expenses would be met out of it.The confusion caused by dual accounting would be removed.    Post Officepolicies would not only be decided, but could be seen to be decided, ontheir commercial merits.7. The year&apos;s financial record would be shown solely in theCommercial Accounts.   A report from the I ostmaster-General wouldaccompany them.   This lines up with modern commercial practice.8. The Post Office would be required to pay its way, taking oneyear with another, after paying the Exchequer contribution.   We are agreed that for the time being this contribution should remain at itspresent level, which amounts roughly to what the Post Office would paythe Exchequer if, like the other nationalised industries, it were liable to taxation.   The question of assessment of the contribution in the long termis more fully considered in Annex A (paragraphs 8 and 9).9. Post Office borrowings would continue to be authorised byActs of Parliament.10. Post Office staff would remain civil servants.Parliamentary control11. There would be no annual authorisation of Post Officeexpenditure by Parliament through Estimates.   But each year:-(a) Parliament would authorise by Vote the salaries of PostOffice Ministers in accordance with the normal procedure;(b) the Postmaster-General would be under statutory obligationto present a Commercial Account and Report (it is theintention that this should be in greater detail than at present)(c) the Postmaster-General would also give Parliament -(i)    a statement on Post Office prospects for the ensuing year(ii)    the investment programme and the intentions for financingit;(iii)    particulars of staff employed;(d) the Post Office Commercial Accounts would be subject toaudit by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and toscrutiny by the Public Accounts Committee as at present.In addition:-(e) the provision of new capital would have to be authorised bythe passing of Money Bills;(f) all tariff changes would be subject to negative resolution.(Hitherto not all Post Office tariff changes have required the assent of Parliament. );(g) Post Office Ministers would continue to answer questions to the same extent as now.-2-
12. The opportunities listed above seem ample, but there is some risk of criticism of what would be a major constitutional innovation.It might on this account be expedient to add a provision that thePoatmaster-General&apos;s powers to draw on the Post Office Fund shouldlapse annually unless renewed by affirmative Resolution.   As will beseen from paragraph 6 of Annex A, in which the matter is more fully setout, we are not wholly agreed as to the need for this and would welcome the views of the Cabinet.Treasury control13. Treasury control of the Post Office would cease except inrelation to:-(a) Pay* grading and conditions of service of staff;(b) investment control (as for the nationalised industries);(c) foreign exchange control.Proposed action14. The implementation of the proposals would require legislation,which would take some time to draft.   But we should like to announcethem in a White Paper at an early date.   It would show continued vitalityof Government thinking in the field of nationalised enterprise. ,D.H.A.E.M.10th April, 1959-3-
Annex ACOPY OF MINUTE FROM THE CHANCELLOR OF THE exchequer to THE PRIME MINISTERPrime minister the Future Of the Post office i have discussed the attached Report by officials with the Postmaster General.I fully accept the conclusions that:  (i) the Postmaster General&apos;s proposals would give the Post Office freedom to run its services on commercial lines in a way not provided for by theexisting statutory and accounting procedures;(ii) the proposals are fully appropriate to the running by the State of a monopoly trading concern under a Minister responsible to Parliament.2. Present procedures are based on the long standing principle that allrevenues of the Crown, including Post Office revenue, should be paid into theExchequer. The expenses of the Post Office, like those of any other GovernmentDepartment, then have to be voted by Parliament in Annual Estimates. expenditure is therefore subject to Treasury control though in recent times that control hasbeen lightly exercised.3. The Postmaster General feels that these arrangements are not adapted tothe running of a business on commercial lines. He proposes therefore that PostOffice revenue should in future be paid into, and its expenses met -without annualauthorisation by Parliament from a Trading Fund quite separate from theExchequer. This Fund would be managed by the Post Office, who alone would beaccountable for it. The Post Office would be expected so to manage its affairs asto pay its way after making an appropriate contribution (see paragraph 8) to theExchequer. This separation of Post Office finances from the Exchequer is the hubof the Postmaster GeneraFs proposals. Subject to a satisfactory settlement of certainissues discussed in later paragraphs (6-9) I can see no reason why it should not takeplace.4. The proposals do not make the Post Office into a Nationalised Industry.They leave it as a Government Department directly under the control of a Minister.Treasury control of Post Office expenditure would, however, cease, except for:  (a) pay, grading and conditions of service of staff;(b) investment control (as for the nationalised industries);(c) foreign exchange control.Apart from these matters there is no real need for Treasury intervention in PostOffice affairs.5. Acceptability of the proposals depends on Parliaments being satisfied,in the special circumstances of the Post Office, with the opportunities which would remain for it to debate Post Office finance and policies. The House of commons would still have ample opportunities for considering Post Office affairs:  (i) it would have to authorise by Vote the salaries of Post Office ministers in accordance with the normal procedures;(ii) it could if it desired hold a debate on the Post Office when passing thisVote; or on another occasion when the Postmaster General fulfilledthe statutory obligation which would be placed on him to presentannually a Commercial Account and Report (it is the intention thatthis should be in greater detail than at present);(iii) the Postmaster General would also give the House annually:(a) a statement on Post Office prospects for the ensuing year including a forecast of the commercial out-turn;(b) the investment programme and the intentions for financing it;(c) particulars of staff to be employed;55024CONFIDENTIAL
(iv) Parliament would have to pass a periodic Money Bill to authorise theprovision of capital;(v) all tariff changes would be subject to negative resolution.   (This is notrequired at present for all changes.)Post Office Ministers would continue to answer Questions in Parliament as atpresent. The Post Office Commercial Accounts would be subject to audit by the comptroller and Auditor General and to the normal scrutiny and report by thePublic Accounts Committee.6. I agree with the proposals in the previous paragraph and think that theyshould give Parliament a better understanding of Post Office finance and policies.But I feel bound to warn you that they would represent a major constitutionalinnovation and a departure from the long-established principle that (with theexception of certain charges on the Consolidated Fund for debt service, judicialsalaries, &amp;c.) the Government cannot spend any part of the public revenues withoutthe annual authority of Parliament. The proposal might indeed be criticised bythe theorists as a retrograde step towards the conditions before Parliament had won its long struggle for supremacy over the Crown in financial matters. I feelthat we ought not to run the risk of this sort of criticism if we can avoid it. Ibelieve that we could do so, by providing that the Postmaster GeneraFs powers todraw on the proposed Post Office Fund should lapse annually unless renewed by affirmative resolution. This would not need any extra Parliamentary time, since it could be debated in conjunction with the Post Office Commercial Account andReport. The Postmaster General does not welcome this proposal since he regardsit as unnecessary and, to some extent, inconsistent with the concept of the PostOffice as a trading concern. But if our colleagues feel that the proposed changes would otherwise be likely to open the Government to criticism, he is prepared toaccept it.Exchequer Contribution7. There is one important point which officials reserved for Ministers andon which I think we ought to clear our minds before final decisions are taken onthe future status of the Post Office. That is how the annual contribution to theExchequer should be fixed. The Postmaster General and I are agreed that aState monopoly such as the Post Office, which constitutes a sector of our national economic activity comparable with other great industries, both public and private,ought to make a fair contribution towards the expenditure of central Government.The Postmaster General would fix this contribution at the broad level of whatthe Post Office but for its exemption would pay in the way of national taxation.8. This would put the Post Office in the same position in this respect as the nationalised industries; and it would at present produce an annual contributionmuch like the existing one of  5 millions. My own view is that it is in principleinappropriate in the case of a State monopoly to fix the contribution by referenceto the taxation which would fall on its profits if it were liable since it is largelyfree to determine its own profits and has neither an obligation nor normal, incentives to do more in the long run than to pay its way. It seems to me more logical to expect the Post Office, and indeed the other nationalised industries, to contribute to the Exchequer a sum which is proportionate to that paid in direct taxation bythe general run of private industry and commerce. This proportion should be measured by the dimensions of the business, in terms of its turnover. On this basis the Exchequer contribution would be fixed as a percentage of Post Officeturnover, the percentage figure being the total direct taxation borne by the totalityof private industry and commerce expressed as a percentage of its total turnover.9. Nevertheless I recognise that to adopt this alternative principle forthwithwould be a matter of great difficulty, since it would at least double the presentcontribution and would be bound to lead to an immediate and substantial increasein Post Office charges. In these circumstances I should be ready to see the contribution fixed initially in accordance with the Postmaster GeneraPs proposal in effect at about its present level provided that it was recognised that theultimate aim in respect of all the nationalised industries, including the Post Office,should be to adjust the level of contribution as and when possible to the levelderiving from the principle of assessment which I have put forward.
Basis for Payment for Agency Services10. Another point which officials left unresolved was the basis on whichagency services rendered by the Post Office to other Government Departments (orvice versa) should be paid for. It is agreed that they should be paid for in cash andthat public tariffs would apply wherever they exist. The question is whether inother cases the Post Office should undertake agency services at cost or whether itshould be free to negotiate terms with other Departments. Hitherto it has beenthe accepted principle that transactions between Departments should be chargedat cost; and the Public Accounts Committee has recently reaffirmed its agreementwith this principle. The Postmaster General feels that, whatever may have beenthe case hitherto, his concept of the Post Office as a business would justify greater freedom. I am prepared to consider whether the charge made in such cases might at any rate take account of the Post Office obligation to make a contribution tothe Exchequer. Before reaching a firm view, however, I should like to give further thought both to this and to the idea that the Post Office might be allowed to include an actual element of profit in its charges to other Departments. At present I am not very sympathetic to that suggestion. This need not stand in the way of approvalof the Postmaster GeneraFs proposals in other respects.11. These proposals do not take us very far towards solving the problems ofthe other nationalised industries; but they may help. If the new relationship withParliament were tried out and proved satisfactory and if the Exchequer contributionwere settled on a basis of principle, the new arrangement might well provide someguide for the development of the other nationalised industries. It would proveconcrete evidence of fresh thinking in the field of nationalised industries generally and would demonstrate our readiness to adapt our arrangements to changingconditions. You may wish to consult some of our colleagues about the outstanding points mentioned above. Subject to this, I suggest that the Postmaster general should be authorised to prepare a White Paper describing the proposals.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,3rd April, 1959.
CONFIDENTIAL^ ahnbx sTHE FUTURE OP THE POST OFFICBJoint Memorandum &quot;fry the Treasury and the Post Off.jpGeneral background the Post Office is constitutionally a Revenue1 Department!.Throughout the greater part of the past 150 years the exchequer has gained to the extent that Post Office revenues exceededexpenses.    The Bridgeman reforms in 1932 put a limit on the useof the Post Office in this way by fixing a definite contributionto the Exchequer beyond which any net earnings were at thedisposal of the Post Office.2.      This arrangement, suspended during the War,, wasreintroduced by the White Paper published in 1955 (Cmd.  9576).The annual contribution to the Exchequer was then set for an initial period of five years beginning in 1956 at  5 million.At the same time particular emphasis was laid on the Post OfficeCommercial Accounts as the basis of Post Office budgetary policy.These accounts were brought more closely into line with normal commercial practice.3.      Parliamentary accounting requirements, common to all government Departments, were not, however, modified to take account of the position of the Post Office as a trading concern.Whilst framing its policies as if its finances were self-contained,it has continued paying all its revenue into the Exchequer.    all its expenses have had to he voted by Parliament in AnnualEstimates,  subject to the normal Treasury control.    these arrangements were,  of course, designed for the purpose of controlling the general expenditures of Government;    and they arenot well adapted to the running of the Post Office as a business.km     The Post Office feels strongly^ therefore, that new arrangements should be sought which would:-(i)    make the principle of &quot;self contained finance&quot; areality by giving the Post Office power to operate1
independently on a commercial basis, while at the sametime maintaining full accountability through itsMinistar to Parliament and the public;(ii)    make the true position of the Post Office;,,  as acommercial organisation running services tiaac are paid for &quot;by its customers, clearer to Parliament and to thegeneral public;(iii)    eliminate the confusion and waste of effort entailed bythe present system of dual accounting.The Postmaster General :&apos;s proposals.      The Postmaster General hae put forward proposals designed tomeet these desiderata and to blend the advantages of directMinisterial responsibility to Parliament and of public corporation status.    Their essential features are:-(i)    the Postmaster General (who would continue to be amember of the Government) would remain responsible for post Office policy and the running of its services;(ii)   Post Office staff would remain Civil Servants(iii)    all Post Office revenues would be paid into, and expenses met out of, a Trading Fund quite separate fromthe Exchequer.    The Post Office would be expected topay its way on a commercial basis, taking one year with another, after making an appropriate contribution tothe Exchequer,    All services to and from other government Departments would be paid for in cash;(iv)    the Commercial Accounts of the Post Office would formthe essential record of the year&apos;s business.    Audit bythe Comptroller and Auditor General and scrutiny by thePublic Accounts Committee would continue;(v)    arrangements for making tariff changes would betightened up so that all were subject to negative resolution of the House of Commons;2
(vi)    Treasury control over Post Office expenditure would &quot;be discontinued except in the cases of;-(a) pay,  grading and conditions of service of post Office staff;(b) investment control (as for the nationalised industries);(c) foreign exchange control. &apos;It is a consequence of this proposal that existingTreasury control over the numbers of Post Office staff would disappear.    The question whether this freedomwould extend to sections of the Post Office (e.g.  the savings Certificate Division) wholly engaged on work carried out on behalf of other Departments has been left over for further consideration.6.     Before examining these proposals we looked briefly at thequestion whether there would be advantage in converting the PostOffice, or some part of it,  into a orthodox Public Corporation.We felt bound to reject the idea of the postal services being undertaken by a Public Corporation on the grounds among othersthat the community in this (as in most) countries expects itsmails to be carried by State servants under the direct control ofthe Government.    Although we have not examined the question indetail we feel that, at any rate for the present, the tele-communication services should be kept together with the mails ina single Post Office organization.Removal of Post Office Revenue from the Exchequer7.      The proposal that Post Office revenue should be paid into and expenditure met from a statutory Trading Fund under thecontrol of the Postmaster General represents a major departure from long established constitutional practice.    In the latter part of the 18th century the Commissioners of Public Accountsstrongly advocated the formation of a single Exchequer Fund into3
CONFIDENTIAL ,        jqjwhich all Government revenues should he paid.    Legislative effect was given to this recommendation in the Consolidated Fund Act of1816 which provided that &quot;All rates, duties,  taxes, receipts,sums of money, and revenues of what nature or kind so evershall he carried to and shall he and become and shall form andconstitute one general fund,  to be called the Consolidated fund of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;.    At aboutthe same time it was also finally established that government expenditure could be incurred only with the specific authority ofParliament.    The establishment of these two principles was, ofcourse,  the culmination of Parliament&apos;c. long struggle toestablish its financial accendlancy over the Crown.    The proposeddivorce of Post Office finance from the Exchequer thereforedepends on Parliament being willing to accept,  in the specialcircumstances of this Department^  a departure from thene long-established arrangements and a different means of securing controlover Post Office expenditure.    It ij also necessary that parliament saould be willing to see Treasury control over thePost Office abolished save in the matters referred to inparagraph 5 (vi) above.Parliamentary Control8.      It is suggested by the Post Office that provision forannual authorisation by Parliament of expenditure isinappropriate to the running of a business in which income andexpenditure are complementary.    It also seems to them unnecessarysince Parliament would, under the Postmaster General&apos;3 proposals,be provided with full opportunities for debating Post Officefinance on the foilowing occasions:-(. i)    it would have to authorise by Vote the salaries of PostOffice Ministers in accordance with the normalprocedures;hGO) N FB DE NTS AL
CONFIDENTIAL(ii)    the Postmaster General would he under statutory-obligation to present annually a Commercial Account andReport (it is the intention that this should be in greater detail than at present);(ill)    the Postmaster General would also give the Houseannuallys(a) a statement on Post Office prospects for the ensuing year including a forecast of thecommercial out-turn;(b) the investment programme and the intentionsfor financing it;(ej    particulars of staff to be employed;(iv)   Parliament would have to pass periodic Money Bills toauthorise the provision of capital;(v)    all tariff changes wou3d be subject to negativereso? ution.It is also intended that the presem practice of Post; OfficeMinisters answering Questions in Parliament would remain unaltered.,,    Parliament would thus have no less opportunity thanin the past to examine the finances of the Post Office.    Itshould huve a better understanding of Post Office policies and methods,9*      Nevertheless for Parliament to give a Minister in perpetuity the resources to meet expenditure of several hundredmillion pounds each year Yi/ould be a constitutional innovation.Although consideration of Estimates may have become somewhat of aformality, Parliament might be reluctant to go so far as theproposals contemplate in abandoning the instiument of controlprovided by the annual voting of money.10.    On the assumption that Parliament would be willing to forgo the submission of detailed estimates,  the Treasury feelthat the House of Commons might reasonably expect  to retain the5
power to limit the total volume of Post Office expenditure in eachyear.    This might he achieved &quot;by providing that Post Officerevenue should he paid into a Post Office Fund, but that the total amount which could he paid out of the Fund in any year wouldrequire to be voted by Parliament on an Estimate presented by thePostmaster General and not requiring Treasury assent.    Ii this were no less of a formality than present Estimates procedure thePost Office agrees that it need not in practice hamper the readyadjustment of Post Office expenditure in accordance with the needsof its business.    If it were otherwise,  it could be serious, andthey argue that it would be clearly inconsistent with the concept of the Post Office as a business concern, answerable in terms ofits results.    If some positive authority, beyond what is outlined in paragraph 8, were required annually the Post Office would prefer to explore the possibility of a procedure under which thePostmaster General&apos;s powers to use Post Office Funds &quot;for thepurposes of the Post Office&quot; would expire each year unlesscontinued by a special Act, or preferably hy a Parliamentaryresolution.Treasury Oontrol11.    It is agreed chat Treasury control should continue over theconditions of service of Post Office staff and over investment and foreign exchange as part of the Governments control over thecivil service and over general economic policy.    The Post Officeattaches importance to achieving complete independence fromTreasury control in all other respects.    The Tieasury recognisethat this is indeed an integral part of the Postmaster General&apos;sproposals,,    They are conscious, however, that in discharging itsown responsibilities Parliament customarily relies to aconsiderable extent upon the control exercised by the Treasury.They do not feel confident that Parliament would be willing tosee all Treasury control over Post Office revenue and expenditure
relinquished.    If it were necessary to meet Parliament in thismatter., the Treasury suggest that much of the substance of thePost Office objective might in practice he achieved by retaining the present system of Post Office finance, while furtherextending the already wide delegation of spending authority tothe Post Office.    But they recognise that this would fall short of and would not really he in conformity with the proposals whichthe Postmaster General has in mini.Contribution to the Exchequer12.    A further question is the contribution which the Pest office should make to the Excnequer,    Under present, arrangements,  thePost Office (like other Government Departments) is exempt fromrational taxation in ail hut a few esses.    We recommend that thisexemption should continue,  if only because it wouxd be emharrass-ing if a dispute were to arise on an assessment to tax made byone Government Department (the Inland Revenue) on another (thePost Office).    But if so the Post Office ought,  in keeping withits commercial status,  to make a cash payment to the Exchequer in lieu of, and approximately equivalent in amount to, the nationaltaxation from which it is exempt.    This contribution could probably best be assessed annually.13.    The Treasury question whether the Post Office should heexempted from making an additional contribution to the Exchequerover and above this.    They argue that a State monopoly such asthe Post Olfice is an obvious, flexible, convenient and generally acceptable instrument for securing at least a modestcontribution towai&apos;cis the general requirements of public expenditure, and that it was so used in past times.    Moreover,they see no reason why such -i contribution,  if fixed for aperiod of years ahead,  should in practice prove detrimental tothe management of Post Office services on a commercial basis.1h*    On the other hand the Post Office argue that it would be quite inconsistent with their functioning as a trading7
organisation,  analogous with the nationalised industries,  if theywere expected to make arbitrarily fixed contributions to thenational revenue over and &quot;beyond the equivalent of normaltaxation.    They hold strongly that if the Government find itnecessary to raise additional revenue from the users of PostOffice services,  it should he done by levying a tax openly anddirectly on the services concerned in the same way as taxes arelevied on other goods.and services.Financial arrangements between the Post Officeand other Government Departments15.    The Post Office undertakes many services on behalf of other government Departments as being the most convenient piece ofmachinery available for the purpose.    These include the paymentof family allowances and pensions,  the selling of national healthinsurance stamps and many licences,  the administration ofnational savings securities etc.    Under the present proposals thePost Office would continue to carry out these and other agencyservices as Government policy might require.    Gash payment would need to be made for such services hy the Departments on whose&quot;behalf they were carried out.    The Treasury consider that,according to the normal practice of transactions between one government Department and another,  any such services should be rendered at a charge which was accepted by the Treasury as representing the costs involved, or,  in cases where use was madeof a public Post Office service, at the tariff charge.    The same principle would apply in the case of services received hy thePost Office from other Government Departments.    The Post Officedisagree in respect of those services which are not the subjectof a public tariff.    Most of these,  such as the payment ofpensions,  involve remittance or banking operations analogous withthose which the Post Office performs in the course of its ownbusiness.    They constitute a large part of the Post Office8COMF5DEMT8AL
CONFIDENTIAL &quot;        \ Qcounter business and therefore the Post Office considers that itshould have the right to negotiate with Government departments the terms on which they should be provided.    At the same time thePost Office would recognise that the reasonableness of the termsit offered might be a matter for decision by the Government as awhole.Responsibility for Broadcasting questions16.    The Postmaster General is at present responsible for broadcasting matters,  a responsibility which embraces not onlythe Governments powers and functions in relation to the B.B.C.and I.T.A., but also licensing,  the allocation of frequencies,control of radio interference, etc.    These functions are quiteextraneous to the running of the postal,  telecommunications andother services forming the Post Office business.    It seems probable that as a matter of Ministerial convenience it would bethought right that the Postmaster General should retain these responsibilities.    But,  if so,  they ought not to be regarded asfunctions carried out by the Post Office in the course of itscommercial business and the expenditure involved ought to be met from the Broadcasting Vote.Legislation17.    Implementation of the proposals discussed in this report would require legislation.    It is difficult to estimate whatwould he involved in its preparation, but it is clear that muchdetailed work would he necessary in advance of the presentation of a Bill.    This could not be done quickly.Conclusions:    The Post Office18.    Ministers will vaish to form their own conclusions as to the likely reaction of Parliament to the suggestion that it shouldentirely relinquish its traditional form of control over theGovernment by voting funds (in this case provided by the public in payment for services), and to the suggestion that the Treasury
should no longer exercise its role as &quot;wa&amp;otorKUj-g&quot; on expenditure.Retention of either of these features would suD-i?mc--t from thenear Public Corporation status proposed for the Post Office.19.    Subject to this,  the Treasury and the Post Office agreethat: -(i)    the Postmaster General&apos;s proposals would give the PostOffice freedom to run its services on commercial lines in a way not provided for by the existing statutory andaccounting procedures;(ii)    they are fully appropriate to the running by the Stateof a monopoly trading concern under a minister responsible to Parliament;(iii)    although the proposals described in paragraph 8 wouldinvolve constitutional changes,  the control byParliament envisaged by the Postmaster General couldbe accomplished by means which are not novel toParliament;(iv)    apart from the matters detailed in paragraph 5 (vi),there is no real need for Treasury intervention in post Office affairs.The Nationalised Industr1es20.    In view of the terms of the Prime Minister&apos;s Minute of16th December,  1958, we have given some thought to the questionwhether adoption of the Postmaster General&apos;s ideas for the PostOffice would be likely to provide lessons which might later beapplied to the general problem of nationalisation.21.    For present purposes the problem can be considered in two parts,  i.e.  the relationships of the nationalised industries withParliament and with the Executive.22.    As regards the first of these,  the relationship - of thePost Office with Parliament would,  if the present proposals are adopted, continue primarily to be determined by the&apos; fact that it10CONFIDENTIAL
&quot;1VLLN3ai:iIMCO &apos;       1Q3would remain a Government Department headed by a Ministeranswerable to Parliament for the running of the business.    If itwould in no circumstances be thought appropriate for any of thePublic Boards to be correspondingly headed by a Minister,obviously the system adopted in the Post Office would not be relevant.    If, however,  this were not regarded as a closedquestion,  and if the Post Office could show that good businessmanagement was not incompatible with direct responsibility toParliament, the evidence would be useful to the general question.23.    Post Office relations with Parliament through the comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee would continue substantially unchanged under the present proposals,although the proposed concentration on commercial accountingwould call for a materially different approach by these authorities to the Post Office as compared with ordinaryGovernment Departments.    The question he-re is whether it would bedesirable to bring the Public Boards into a similar relationship;it has hitherto been felt by successive Governments that itwould not.2h.    The relationship of the Post Office with the Executivewould be determined largely by the fact that under these proposalsits head would continue to be a Member of the Government (and its staff members of the Civil Service).    This means that the relationship of Government to Post Office remains an internalrelationship within a single body - the Government.    And the major policies,of the Post Office - although determinedprimarily by the Postmaster General - remain policies of theGovernment itself and therefore within the collective responsibility of Ministers.25.    The situation of the Nationalised Industries in thisrespect is quite different.    The Governments relationship tothem j.s an external relationship with separate authoritieswllnMiwnco
29th January, -1959T.161-59CONFIDENTIALentirely responsible for the day-to-day conduct of their business which, unlike the Post Office,  is not the concern of a Minister.Unless it is thought to he within the hounds of possibility thatthey should be converted into Government Departments headed by ministers,  it is difficult to see, whatever changes it may bethought desirable to make in cheir relationship with Governmentand in the control which Government exercises over them,  thatthe situation of the Post Office could have much relevance to thematter.26.    Nevertheless,  the proposals described in this memorandumhave interesting possibilities,  in so far as they represent anattempt to adapt to the ministerial system the circumstances ofwhat is in substance a nationalised industry.    The Post. Officewish to add that the more closely any experiment undertaken withthem is in accordance with the Postmaster General&apos;s proposals the more useful might the lessons be.
