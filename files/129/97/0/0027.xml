I SECRET-THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  April 1959C. (59) 77 Copy No.     5 430th April, 1959CABINETCONTROL OF GOVERNMENT expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 19th March the Cabinet invited me to circulate detailed proposals on the composition of an internal enquiry into the control of Government expenditure,and the range of subject-matter with which such an enquiry should be concerned(C.C. (59) 18th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. The general range of the enquiry would be to consider the principles and practice which govern the control by the Executive of public expenditure. (Themain emphasis would be on voted expenditure, but expenditure below the linewould not be excluded.)  In particular, it would cover (a) The present requirements of Parliamentary control, and the extent towhich they determine the pattern of control exercised both by theTreasury and by the spending Departments. Suggestions could be madeas to whether there are any changes in the practices of Parliament itselfwhich Ministers might seek to institute.(b) The role of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the methods by which,and the limits within which, he exercises control through the Treasuryover the spending Departments. This would include examination insome detail of the procedures, both formal and informal, pursued bythe Treasury and the spending Departments. It would also includethe general arrangements by which financial and economic considerations are brought to bear on the formation of Government policy at all levels, including the Ministerial, both by bilateral discussions betweenthe Treasury and the spending Department immediately concerned,and by collective consideration by the Cabinet, Cabinet Committees,and sub-committees.(c) The methods of control followed by spending Departments themselves both at their headquarters and in the field, including control over contractors&apos;expenditure. Consideration would be given to the methods which departments adopt to ensure that due importance is attached to efficiency and economy right down the line, whether the point at which expenditure is incurred or committed is part of the ordinary CivilService machine or not. Important examples of the latter case are the armed Forces, Local Authorities, and the Hospital Boards.3. I do not think the enquiry should range into general questions ofGovernment structure: it should take the existing pattern of departmental responsibilities as it finds it. But changes of structure within Departments would,like changes of method, not be excluded. I would expect that, in the course of theenquiry, some matters would be identified as needing more detailed considerationthan could appropriately be given by those conducting the general enquiry. Insuch cases specific Committees might be set up.4. As to the constitution of the enquiry, it should, I think, be conducted underthe general aegis of the Chancellor of the Exchequer under reference to the Cabinet.It is important that those conducting the enquiry should include a sufficient number55124
Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,30th April, 1959.of people who have a thorough knowledge of how things in fact work, particularly at the centre of the Government machine (i.e., Ministerial and Cabinet procedure),and of the day-to-day relations between the Treasury and the Departments. Ithink we should include a number of senior serving civil servants, one from theTreasury and two or three from other Departments. I previously suggested that are tired Permanent Secretary might direct work at the official level. There mightbe advantage in having as Chairman someone not so closely associated in the publicrriind with the existing establishment. If it were thought desirable to have an ex-Ministef, my choice would be Lord Ingleby. If not, Lord Plowden (assuminghim to be willing) would do the job admirably. Apart from the Chairman, we might have two or three other people with outside experience. The sort of manI have in mind is Sir Sam Brown of Linklaters and Paines. We must remember thatall members of the enquiry would necessarily be made privy to a lot of highlyconfidential information.5. I would give the Chairman considerable discretion about how to conduct the enquiry. I would not see it as a formal Committee. The names I have suggested above would be the nucleus, but other people could he freely co-opted, formallyor informally, to help with particular parts of the enquiry where their knowledge or experience would be specially useful.D.
