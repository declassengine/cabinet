\secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTLIBERALISATION OF DOLLAR imports memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer do not wish to burden my colleagues with another lengthy paper on thissubject.  I would, however, like to emphasise the following points :  (a) General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the international monetary Fund (I.M.F.)We must not under-estimate the importance internationally of our failure to take this further step towards liberalisation. It is not that it will be helpful to us in the GATT and the I.M.F. if we take it; it is that we shall come in for very severe criticism indeed if we do not. At the GATT meeting in May weshall be in the dock, compelled to justify our remaining restrictions anddiscrimination, under procedures which we have been foremost in establishingbecause of the importance to us of securing the maximum freedom of tradeand payments. We have no answer to make. There is no justification wecould offer for failure to take this further limited step in the removal of restrictions; and the damaging conclusion might be drawn that all is far fromwell in the United Kingdom, or that we are taking offensive action in breach of specific commitments against the United States. This would have mostserious repercussions. It could well put at risk our rights of access to theFund&apos;s resources.(b) Effect on the Balance of payments the proposals are estimated to involve at the outside an addition ofperhaps  17 millions to our import bill. This has to be measured against theyearly bill of around  4,000 millions. The effect of these proposals and those for the Colonies together on the balance of payments may be perhaps 20 millions. This is well covered by the estimated surplus on current accountthis year of the order of  250 millions, after allowing for Budget reflation.(c) ReciprocityThe United States has no quota restrictions at all on United kingdom exports; the present proposals for liberalisation themselves show that we imposequota restrictions on hundreds of different products from them, and when wehave freed the present list we shall still have restrictions over a considerablenumber of their important exports. As an example of the way in which therules work against the United States, we exported to the United States cars tothe value of  63 millions in 1958; they exported to us cars to a value of 260,000.(d) The United Kingdom TariffThe Prime Minister asked about tariff protection on the goods to beliberalised. Goods from Canada will, of course, be free of duty (or enjoypreferential rates) and this in itself means that the proposals confer an advantage on Canada over the United States.   The tariff on United StatesPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1959C. (59) 7428th April, 1959Copy No. 5 9CABINET55116B
goods is set out in the Annex. This shows that the tariff will be 10 per cent,or greater in nearly every case. In many cases the tariff will be 20 per cent,or more. These tariff rates are the same as we impose against other foreigncountries, including Germany which, of course, generally has lower costs thanthe United States. In some cases the level of the tariff has been bound as partof a bargain for which we received value in return; but United States benefits under the bargain have for years been frustrated by the quotas.(e) TimingIt has been suggested that it might be sufficient to reaffirm at the GATTmeeting in May the Montreal declaration and say that we will take the further measures foreshadowed then in the next two or three months. It would bethought odd that we felt able to take, as approached the seasonally weakerperiod, steps which we could not take now. But a firm statement of this kind,without any qualification, would undoubtedly go some way towards avoiding the dangers of taking no action now. Clearly, the more our spokesman was able to define the scope of the next step the more acceptable it would beinternationally. But the more he did say, the less would be the advantage tobe gained domestically from postponing an announcement here. Any attemptto qualify the statement, or to make it conditional on action by others, would inevitably lead to the dangers I have mentioned above.2. In general the time to take any strain there may be in removing restrictionsis when the economy is expanding. The steps we have taken, culminating in theBudget, will ensure that when this liberalisation becomes effective we are in thebest position both internally and on the balance of payments to accept it.3. Assuming we decide to go ahead on Thursday, I propose that theCommonwealth should be informed of our proposals immediately afterwards.It is important that at the Commonwealth Officials&apos; Meeting on 5th May we shouldbe able to say that proposals have been communicated to their Governments.Informing the Commonwealth creates some risk of leakage, but there is nocommercial danger in this because (unlike the situation when import cuts areimposed) traders can gain nothing by anticipating the Governmenfs action.4. A public announcement could be put off as long as the GATT proceedingsallow, perhaps until the third week in May. But it would obviously be desirableto make it before the Whitsun Recess as it could not be held up until after parliament reassembles. In any case, I think I should inform Mr. Anderson in confidence ofthe proposals when I see him on 7th May.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.28th April, 1959.
ANNEXPROTECTIVE IMPORT DUTIES ON ITEMS TO BE LIBERALISEDNotes1.   Only protective (and not revenue) duties are shown.2. The duty chargeable on imported goods depends on their precisedescription. Column 4 therefore gives only a broad indication of the duty (or range of duties) likely to apply.3. The duties shown are the full rates applicable to foreign (including UnitedStates) goods. Goods of Commonwealth (including Canadian) origin are free fromprotective duty except where a Preferential (&quot; Pref.&quot;) rate is shown for them.I.
