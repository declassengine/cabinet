THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government... &apos;. Printed for the&apos; Cabinet,   March 1959&apos;   - ^C. (59) 5612th March, 1959.CABINETPOSSIBILITY OF DISTURBANCES IN EAST africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesThere is no evidence that the disturbances in Nyasaland and other parts ofthe Central African Federation are part of a co-ordinated plan by the AfricanNationalists aimed at subverting British authority in both Central and East Africa.On the other hand, even if there is no deliberate plan for extensive action, therestill remains the danger that the events in Nyasaland may touch off trouble in oneor more of the East African territories where in any event there are potential threatsto order arising from the domestic political situation in each. In that eventco-ordinated action between the leaders might well develop.Kenya2. In C. (59) 42 I reported that the Governor, with my support, was about to take certain action in the interests of security. These measures have been taken and, so far, have passed off reasonably well. The most influential African leader,Mboya, sent me a telegram vigorously criticising the banning of his newspaper,Uhuru and the putting under restraint of some of his party members. Therehave been Press reports of some reaction on the part of some Europeans to thebanning of the European-owned publication, Comment, but there has been noviolence. Events in Nyasaland have been closely followed by Africans in theColony but again without positive reaction. Apart from Mboya&apos;s condemnationof the use of Tanganyika police in Nyasaland, this operation has caused littlecomment. Mboya himself is reported to have said that he is anxious to avoid any action which might result in his being unable to carry out visits to the UnitedStates and Ghana due to begin at the end of March. Nyerere, the leader of the Tanganyika African National Union, has recently spent a few days in Kenya withMboya see paragraph 8 below.3. On the general political front, there is still very little indication that the africans are willing to enter into informal discussions on constitutional matters,and the situation of deadlock remains. Some of the Africans are suggesting thatthey should come home to see me in company with a few of their Asian and european supporters to discuss constitutional matters. The Governor and I are trying to hold off their coming in the very near future as we are at the momentconsidering the possibility of issuing a statement on the future of Kenya whichwould have the object of rallying support amongst, in particular, loyalist Africansand Asians.4. My own judgment is that, although Mboya will do all he can to intensifythe war of nerves on which he is engaged, it is not likely that he will commit himself to a campaign of violence at any rate in the immediate future. But I maybe wrong about this; and, in any case, should there be trouble in Tanganyika (seeparagraph 8 below) there might be attempts at strong demonstrations in Nairobiand elsewhere in support and these might be a potential danger to peace in theColony.-mmm54888Copy No.  g 2
Uganda1 &apos; -^:;&apos;-&apos;,rK.&apos;;r- $pdi ngobx o;! 5?kx]?.fh yl Um Ti^ibvM im&amp;Sihv.&apos; 5. Two weeks ago the Governor reported a deterioration in the political and security situation as a result of steps being taken by the Kabaka of Buganda, in concert with the Omukania of Toronto sabotage, by boycott, the operations of a constitutional Committee which has recently been set up to study the possibilityof introducing a common roll system in the Protectorate, , This,campaign is, tosome extent, supported by some of the political parties; and, to the extent thatthis; represents: the formation of a sort of common front by the: &quot;traditionalists &quot;ajidv the-&apos;^&apos;:1i8mbcrats&quot; against the central, Government, :it. is a dangerousdevelopment. The Governor feared that after the Queen-Mother-s.-ivisit^Mchi4sin Kenya, went off with marked success) there would be unpleasant incidents whichmight degenerate into violence. Since making this report he&apos;has had a further discussion with the Kabaka on constitutional matters and is now hopeful that, ifhe can succeed in having further talks with the Kabaka and his Ministers, there might he a chance of reaching a concordat with the Kabaka which would putmatters again on a fairly even keel. There is, as yet, no strong monolithic nationalist party in Uganda approaching in any degree the influence of the Tanganyika AfricanNational Union. This is partly because the interests of the African politicians haveconflicted with those of the traditional elements. There is also nolove lost betweenthe Uganda politicians and Mboya and his followers in Kenya; but a new party,the Uganda Nationalist Movement, is giving: cause for concern to the Governor,in that it is rather like the Tanganyika African National Union and may commandcountry-wide support.. 6. In my judgment the risk of there being serious violence in Uganda in thepresent context is slight; though there is the danger that any success attending the outbreaks of civil disturbance in Tanganyika might stimulate this new partyinto taking similar action in Uganda. I have so far seen no report of repercussions in Uganda of the events in Nyasaland. -..Zanzibar7. There is at present little reaction to the Nyasaland disturbances though they are being followed with interest. But (see paragraph 8) some of the nationalistsare showing considerable interest in how the nationalists in Tanganyika willreact to the Governor&apos;s statement to the Legislative Council on Tuesday,17th March. Reports indicate that any &quot; positive action &quot; in Tanganyika wouldbe supported by similar action in Zanzibar. If, therefore, the Tanganyika AfricanNational Union decide on positive action the position in Zanzibar might well become tense. The British Resident is inclined to doubt whether in fact serious trouble would occur in Zanzibar but he realises that this assessment may well befalsified by events. If serious trouble occurred he would need help from Kenya.Tanganyika8. To my mind this represents the most serious danger spot. the Tanganyika African National Union won a sweeping success in the elections anddominate the political scene. A Constitutional Committee will start work in july to study (in effect) ways Of&apos; increasing the number of Africans on therepresentative side.of the Legislative. Council and some broadening of the franchise.Nyerere wants the very early introduction of responsible Government (unofficialmajorities in both the Executive and the Legislature), the introduction of universaladult suffrage and the abolition of the tripartite vote. He is particularly concerned that, while the Committee is making its study, the Governor should be makingplans for the early introduction of these unofficial majorities. On Tuesday,17th March, the Governor will be announcing the terms of reference of theCommittee.,, He will also state that.he will be meanwhile considering with his advisers questions^ relating to the Executive and the; Legislature and will undertaketo make decisions known on these matters when decisions on the work of theCommittee are also ,made known. He will express the hope that at that time(i.e., January 1960) he will also be able to say when it is expected&apos; that&apos; unofficialmajorities will be introduced into the Executive and the Legislature. He will,moreover, also announce in March the fact that he intends to appoint four&apos;uhoflicial.Miriisters.&apos;(two Africans, one Asian.and.one European, drawn, he hopes,fronv the Elected Members); to the Executive as from 1st July.  The question is .
whether Nyerere will be disposed to accept these proposals next week,; .

After discussion with Nyerere-bri 1 Oth March the -Minister&quot;brSiateTorColonial&apos; Affairs gained the impression. that Nyerere would like to accept theproposals but fears to do so lest he should lose support in his party. This is :a severe disappointment. The Governor had already warned Nyerere.that the very early introduction of responsible-Government was not a realistic; proposition: andI had hoped that Nyerere would feel that a decision to go ahead more or lessimmediately with the appointment of some unofficial Ministers, coupled with the promise of a statement which would indicate when responsible Government canbe achieved, indicated a not unreasonable response by Her Majesty VGovernmentto his own sweeping demands. But the Governor rates the chances of acceptanceat no more than 10 per cent, and I must accept that. .&apos; 5 ;10. The Governor^ latest assessment is that Nyerere will reject the proposals but at the same time stress the importance of avoiding violence. Although he alsorates at no more than 10 per cent, the chance of non-acceptance being accompaniedby positive action organised from the Centre the Governor thinks that sporadicdisorders are now inevitable. In addition the leaders of the Tanganyika Federationof Labour are threatening a general strike unless the nationalist demands are met.As mentioned above, there may be some action in sympathy in Zanzibar if thereis trouble in Tanganyika. Moreover, Nyerere has recently visited Mboya in kenya and it seems safe to assume that the possibility of some co-ordinated action was discussed.11. Reactions in Tanganyika to the events in Nyasaland have been rather more positive. In the south the activities of Congress have been applauded bythe Africans though relations with Government officials have not deteriorated. Insome other districts African sympathy for Congress action has also been inflamed.Nevertheless, there is some anxiety among Africans lest the disturbances shouldbe repeated in Tanganyika and some thoughtful leaders in Dar-es-Salaam, forexample, consider that the Congress leaders have acted unwisely in using violencein that it may lead to increased control from Salisbury. Africans in general inDar-es-Salaam have commented adversely on the use of Tanganyika police in nyasaland, and the matter will be raised in Legislative Council. It is suspected,however, that they are less concerned with casualties inflicted on the rioters thanon the possibility of casualties among their own police.12. I have paid particular attention to Tanganyika in this paper partly becausethe Governor^ speech next week may be the occasion for trouble and partly because both the Governor and I are seriously concerned at the state of the police force in Tanganyika.13. One of my Inspectors-General has recently returned from an exhaustiveinspection of the force. Although he has reported favourably on the morale andthe efficiency of the existing force (and the recent successful operation by a detachment of the police in Nyasaland bears witness to this) he has said that it isnumerically inadequate for current needs. I have asked the Governor to let meknow what he wants done so that we can put in the necessary programme of expansion without delay. I have also asked him to let me know at the earliestpossible moment if, having regard to what other police or forces can be madeavailable from within East African resources, he is likely to need British reinforcements. He has not had time to reply to this enquiry but when makingthe assessment referred to in paragraph 10 above, the Governor stated that it is fairly certain that he will have to ask for the reserve (King&apos;s African Rifles) Battalionjto come in on probably 19th or 20th March and to stay for some six months. I am,of course, keeping the Service authorities informed of developments not only;in?regard to Tanganyika but also to the whole of the area generally.-       - hto&apos; )General ..-; ,;limi.iyi: s;\ tiki) K-. ,.. &apos; &apos;^,7;&apos; 1,114. The main purpose of this paper is to warn my colleagues of the possibility,of trouble developing in East Africa, but I have briefly touched, on certain
