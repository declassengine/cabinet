(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 85 COPY NO. ^6th May, 1959CABINETTEACHERS&apos; salaries memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer agreed with the Minister of Education that, as the matter wasurgent, he should put the question of teachers&apos; salaries direct to theCabinet rather than that it should be first considered by the wages policy Committee.   I wish to draw my colleagues&apos; attention, however, tocertain general issues of wages policy which affect the decision to betaken on the Minister&apos;s paper (C.(59) 82):-(a) Last year the Wages Policy Committee reviewed the wholequestion of the control of Management Sides of Whitley Councils and similar bodies, which deal with pay negotiations, of which the whole, ora large part, of the cost falls upon the Exchequer.   It was felt that, if theGovernment was to exercise an effective restraining influence on otherwage negotiations, it must be in a position to control those which it financesitself.    The Committee therefore concluded that in such cases negotiatinglimits should be agreed beforehand between the Government and theEmployers&apos; Side of the negotiating body.   In the case of teachers&apos; salaries,it was recognised that the Government was not represented on the BurnharnCommittee, but as the Ministry of Education were kept in informal touchwith the Employers&apos; Side it was thought that an arrangement could bereached with the Management Side under which they would be willing toagree negotiating limits with the Minister and keep within them.   Thepresent negotiation is the first in which this intention can be put into effect.(b) It is of great importance to maintain the slower rate of annual increase in wages generally which has been achieved in recent months,and we ought to do all we can to keep it down to about 2 per cent this year,and we ought to retard settlements as much as possible.(c) While there is no direct connection between teachers1 salaries and industrial wages, it is quite likely that a 4 per cent increase at the bottom of the teachers&apos; scale   (as proposed in &quot;Offer &apos;C&quot; in paragraph 4of 0.(59) 82) would be taken by employers generally as an indication ofthe rate of increase which the Government regard as tolerable this year.(d) While it is possible to justify on cost of living grounds theZ\ per cent increase in the minimum contained in &quot;Offer &apos;3&apos;&quot;, there is no justification for an increase to 4 per cent as the minimum as in &quot;Offer lC&quot;,either on cost of living grounds, or on grounds of inadequate recruitment,or on grounds of relativity with other comparable occupations (e.g. nursing,and the executive grade in the Civil Service).   The other proposals can bejustified as improving the relativities in favour of graduate teachers, the recruitment of whom is inadequate, and as giving more to teachers whohave done long service.-1-
2. The Minister of Education ha.s, at the&quot; request of the wages policy Committee, cold the representatives of the local authorities thatthe Government cannot agree to a settlement, on she basis of &quot;Offer ,C&apos;&quot;0If he now agrees to it, it is obvious that any future attempt to restrain theauthorities from making an excessive offer to the teachers will be disregarded.3.        In my view the principles at stake in this matter are of more importance than the amount of money involved.   The Exchequer bearsapproximately 60 per cent of the cost of teachers&apos; salaries and we have undertaken to increase the general grant if there is a major Burnhamaward.   In these circumstances it is wrong that the local authorities shouldnot be ready to agree with the Government, in a reasonable spirit of giveand take, the limit to which they will go in negotiation.   I suggest therefore that the Minister of Education should make a renewed effort to agree anegotiating limit with the local authorities.4.        While there is not much case for the increase atthe minimum of thescale under &quot;Offer ,B,M to  510, I think that we can go as far as that if theoffer as a whole is satisfactory.   I would see no objection to the maximum of the scale being raised to  1,000 by an extension of the scale withincrements either at  27. 10.  Od. throughout or preferably at a lower rate in the earlier, and a rather higher rate in the later, years.Recommendation5. My proposal is, therefore, that the Minister should tell the localauthorities&apos; representatives that the Government are still unable to agreeto &quot;Offer &apos;C&apos;&quot;;  that they are anxious to avoid a deadlock arising, theresult of which can only be a breakdown of the Burnham machinery;  andthat they would have no objection to some further concessions beyond&quot;Offer !Bf&quot; provided that they are made at the top of the scale, and tlatthe minimum is not raised above  510.   The Governments reasons forobjecting to an increase in the minimum could be explained to thelocal authorities on the lines of paragraph 1 above.   I should hope that onthis basis the Minister could dissuade the local authorities from making&quot;Offer &apos;C!&quot; in its present form, and would be able to agree with them, asthe limit of negotiation, an improved &quot;Offer &apos;B,M on the lines ofparagraph 4 above.   This is undoubtedly a fair, even generous, offer whichadequately meets educational needs while not endangering general economic policy:  if the local authorities&apos; representatives are reasonable and responsible men they can surely be broughtto agree.    In any event weshould not retreat from the position which we have already taken up that&quot;Offer &apos;C&apos;&quot; is excessive and unacceptable.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.6th May, 1959-2-
