THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  May 1959C. (59) 78 Copy No. 571st May, 1959 ,CABINETBOOK EXPORTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of LancasterIn reporting to the Cabinet on my visit in September 1958 to Asian and African countries, I said &quot; The whole book problem demands urgent examination and solution &quot; (C. (58) 207).2. During the past six months a Working Party under my Chairmanshiphas made a detailed study of this problem.  I attach the Working Party&apos;s report.3. The Ministerial Committee on the Oversea Information Services hasendorsed the findings of the report, the position of the Chancellor of theExchequer being reserved.4.   I summarise below the principal findings and recommendations.The Problem5. There has been a considerable and creditable expansion of commercialsales by the publishing industry in most of the markets open to them. Almosttwo-fifths of the industry&apos;s output is exported, but this effort, commendable asit is, falls short of the opportunity and the need.^ 6. The growing use of English has greatly enlarged the need for books in english, especially in Asia and Africa. In many countries, however, education has outrun purchasing power and the people are too poor to buy even the cheapestpaper-backed books on sale commercially. We are thus unable to seize theopportunity for propagating our ideas and influence which has presented itselfthrough the more widespread use of English.7. The Soviet Union and China have not been slow to see this opportunity and to take advantage of it. Both have embarked on huge programmes of heavily subsided reading matter. They are pouring well-produced books and periodicalsinto Asian countries, and more recently into some African countries, at very low prices. It has been estimated that in 1958 the Soviet Union shipped about  million books and China about 2 million books into India alone. A high proportion of this output is in English. At present most of these books and periodicals in English are not obviously propaganda material. But their longer-term aim is clear to create a pattern of supply and channels of distribution whichwill enable Russia and China to capture the market and gradually introducepropaganda into this reading material.8. The United States is attempting to counter this Communist threat, andto make its own contribution to meeting the unsatisfied demand for reading matter in Africa and Asia, through a scheme known as the &quot; Low-Priced Book Program.&quot;This scheme subsidises the production and distribution of selected American bookson a considerable scale. While this American effort goes some way to meetingthe threat, we cannot be indifferent to the fact that the result is to spread Americanrather than British influence in these sensitive political areas.
9. In certain countries the problem is not only one of purchasing powerbut also of sterling shortage, which causes severe restrictions to be placed on imports of British books and periodicals. These countries include Pakistan, Poland,Yugoslavia, Indonesia, Turkey and Israel, which are of political importance to us.To tackle the parallel problem of dollar shortage the United States operate a schemeknown as the &quot; Informational Media Guaranty Program &quot; which is based largely on the use of counterpart funds against economic aid programmes and where necessary acceptance of large sums of blocked currency.10. On the British side, we are doing nothing officially to meet either thedemand for cheap books or the currency problem. We have recognised theimportance of establishing English as the accepted language of internationalcommunication, and to this end we have provided funds to the British Council to foster and develop the teaching of English. Yet in present circumstances the result is rather to provide a field of exploitation for the Soviet Union and China, and also for the United States. It is of the utmost importance, therefore, that we shoulddevise ways and means of stimulating the circulation of British books and periodicals so that in this way there can be a better understanding of British ideas and a greater currency for British scientific and technical knowledge. This in turncan be expected to assist in the efforts to promote British exports.Recommendations11. There are four main elements in the action recommended by the working party.  They are that we should -(i) Be prepared to accept blocked local currency from certain countries inorder to promote commercial exports, of books and periodicals.(ii) Introduce a low-priced book programme in order to secure widerdistribution of British books, mainly in Asia and Africa.(iii) Seek to improve library and other systems of distribution.(iv) Increase the scale and range of presentation of. books and periodicals bythe British Council.12. The sum involved in launching a low-priced book programme, both in english and in certain vernaculars, is not large. It is estimated that the cost toHer Majesty&apos;s Government of a paper-backed, pocket-sized book of 192 or 256pages would be about Is. 6d, For the recommended expenditure of  162,000 ayear, we should therefore be able to produce and distribute about 2 million copiesof the selected books in English.13. Public opinion is unlikely to need much persuasion about the need forsuch a programme in the light of the massive Sino-Soviet effort. In a scheme forthe selection of titles, however, there are clearly dangers. To minimise the opportunities for criticism, the best course seems to be to set up an AdvisoryCommittee under a Chairman whose independence and good sense is likely to be widely recognised. This would not shield us from questions in Parliament, but itshould help us a good deal in dealing with the general run of such questions.Cost14. If all the recommendations in the report were accepted^ the total costof the various schemes in full operation would be  855,000 a year, calculated asfollows:  (a) British book export schemes......      ...      ......(b) Low-priced book programmes (i) English language    ...      .... .    ......(ii) Vernacular languages       ......      ......(c) Book and periodical presentations: by the British Council(d) Expansion of British Council libraries and services   .....\e) Development of library systems in Colonial territories......(/) Measures to. promote the sale of British periodicals and newspapers overseas ...      ..:Total        ......      ...      .........      855,000
15. This is a substantial sum to add to the  16i millions a year at present authorised for the oversea information services. But in relation to the need and theopportunity it will surely be money well spent.16. Time would be needed to launch the various schemes and it is estimatedthat the new expenditure in 1959-60 would not exceed  250,000.C.

REPORT BY THE WORKING PARTY ON BOOK EXPORTSBACKGROUNDThe Working Party was set up by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterwho had emphasised the need for urgent examination and solution of the whole problem of exports of books and periodicals.2. Under the Chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Duchy, the working party has comprised representatives of the Treasury, Foreign Office,Commonwealth Relations Office. Colonial Office, Board of Trade, Central Office ofInformation and the British Council.3. The Working Party has consulted a number of trade organisations and has met representatives of the Publishers Association, the Periodical ProprietorsAssociation (both General Periodicals and the Trade and Technical Press) and theBritish Federation of Master Printers. Meetings have also been held with Sir AllenLane (Chairman of Penguin Books, Ltd.) and an American expert on the UnitedStates Low-Priced Book Programme.4. The Working Party had before them a world-wide survey of the competitive position of British publications overseas prepared by the British Council, a review by the Foreign Office of reports from posts in South-East Asia and the Middle Easton the increasing circulation of publications in English and other languages fromCommunist and other hostile sources, and a detailed study by the Board of trade of book exports to difficult markets.5. In the past, the problem of book exports has been looked at primarily in commercial terms, including the problem of import restrictions on books imposed by countries chronically short of sterling. Now the threat to Western interests posedby large-scale Soviet and Chinese penetration of the book and periodical market inmany areas has created a new situation. The Working Party&apos;s approach has beenwider: the commercial importance of book exports has taken second place to their importance from a general political standpoint and as an instrument of informationpolicy. A true understanding abroad of the policies of this, or indeed any country,,can only stem from an understanding of its people, what they think and how theylive. Our literature can contribute much to this understanding. British books and periodicals deservedly enjoy the highest reputation and are a political asset whichwe cannot afford to neglect.6. The British Council has been doing valuable work in making books and periodicals available overseas. This effort has recently been substantially increased, especially in India and Pakistan, and the CounciPs total expenditure in1959-60 on books and periodicals (presentations, libraries and related services) forthe 70 countries in which it works is estimated at  650,000. But the spearhead ofour effort is provided by the publishing industry. We still export more books than any other country. As the following figures will show, our publishing industry hasbeen energetic and competitive in developing commercial exports of books (nosimilar figures appear to be available for periodicals):  Total Value Total Value of           Exportof Books Sold Books Exported       Percentage   Per Cent.1937     ...      10,507,204 3,146,157                  301946     ...      26,961,622 6,715,212                  241957              60,456,095 22,505,440                  37-47. But circumstances have changed. The freedom of our publishers to meetthe widespread world demand for British books has been limited in various waysparticularly by the actions of other Governments. In face of this situation nothing but action on the part of Her Majesty&apos;s Government can provide a remedy and our political interests demand that this should be done.
THE PROBLEMS AND THEIR REMEDIES8.   The main problems which have confronted the Working Party are (i) the shortage of foreign exchange in certain countries which would otherwise provide a market for British books;(ii) low personal incomes, particularly in the emergent countries of Asia and africa where the dangers and the opportunities are greatest;(iii) the lack of adequate distributive systems in certain countries.9. There is no doubt that a long-term solution of the first of these problems isunattainable so long as buyers have to pay sterling in full for British books, andthat a readiness in certain cases to accept blocked local currency is an essentialingredient of any Book Export Scheme designed to overcome this difficulty. So faras low purchasing power is concerned, the long-term solution quite clearly is to sellbooks at low prices much lower than could be achieved commercially by theunaided efforts of the publishers. No effective alternative to subsidisation has beenfound. As regards distributive systems, the scope for direct action by theGovernment is limited, but there are certain possibilities which could usefully bediscussed with the publishers.10. Such action can and should be supplemented by certain other measures:presentation of books and periodicals by the British Council to selected institutions and individuals, expansion of British Council libraries and library services,development of library systems in Colonial territories, steps to promote the circulation of British periodicals abroad (possibly including the production of a newillustrated magazine). These can greatly alleviate the position, whether the problem is shortage of sterling or low purchasing power. They do not in themselvesconstitute an adequate long-term solution of either.11. The various remedies are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs, with a fuller exposition of the problems to which they relate.British Book Export Schemes12. In certain countries a demand for British books remains unsatisfiedbecause of shortage of foreign exchange. In the context of the present study the case. for special measures to remedy this state of affairs must rest primarily on political grounds with special reference to information policy. If British books and periodicals are supplanted by those of other countries this may adversely affect thedemand for other British goods. Conversely, the export of British publications willpave the way for the export of other British goods if and when the foreign exchange position improves. But there is no immediate commercial advantage to be gained from stimulating a demand for British goods in countries which do not have themeans to satisfy it and the commercial argument is therefore subsidiary to thepolitical.13. Efforts have been made in the past to tackle the foreign exchange problem in relation to books. These British Book Export Schemes, as they were called, have operated in a number of countries during and since the war. There have been several variations but in general our object in negotiating such schemes has been to persuade the Government concerned to allow a part of the sterling accruing to it from local expenditure by Her Majesty&apos;s Government (e.g., on the maintenance ofan Embassy) to be devoted to the purchase of British books. There is, however,partly in consequence of the more generous American Informational MediaGuaranty (I.M.G.) Programme (see paragraph 22 below), an increasing andunderstandable reluctance on the part of Governments which are short of foreign exchange to allow such sterling as they may earn to be committed in this way. this applies particularly where the expenditure by Her Majesty&apos;s Government of local currency is to be maintained at the existing level.14. Schemes operated on this basis have lapsed and it seems likely that anyfurther schemes will have to be negotiated on the basis of either (a) acceptance of currency in a blocked account, or(b) increased expenditure by Her Majesty&apos;s Government on economic,technical, cultural or information activities acceptable to the country concerned.
15.   Some of the objections to British Book Export Schemes are:  (i) Sales of goods for blocked currency promote our exports artificially andconflict with our policy of fostering multilateral trade and payments.(ii) Special treatment for books may lay us open to the charge of artificiallyfostering one particular export.(iii) It may be difficult to limit the schemes to the sums and countries originallyinvolved.16. It would, however, be a mistake to judge these schemes by the criterianormally used in assessing schemes for assisting commercial exports. We are not seeking to extend our exports of goods in order to gain foreign exchange with which to pay for imports but because we want our books to be read. We are proposingin effect a form of aid. In any case, the rest of industry is unlikely to challenge theclaim of books to exceptional treatment.17. The countries in which the Working Party have found that there is ashortage of sterling to buy British books and periodicals are (in alphabetical order):Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, Israel, New Zealand, Pakistan, Poland, Spain, Turkey,Yugoslavia. There is a good case for seeking the agreement of the Governmentsconcerned for using the Book Export Scheme method in the following countries:Indonesia, Pakistan, Poland, Turkey and Yugoslavia. The Working Party wouldalso wish to see this method applied to Israel, in conjunction with some schemeinvolving the use of private capital in this country destined for investment in Israel,and possible schemes are being studied by Jewish interests in the United Kingdom.It may of course be necessary at a later stage to propose book export schemes forother countries where import restrictions do not yet exist or where, as in India,their effects have yet to be felt.18. The Working Party therefore recommend that authority be given tonegotiate book export schemes with the above countries on the basis that blockedcurrency may be accepted as a last resort, and that the United Kingdom Exchequer^liability, whether in the form of blocked currency or additional local expenditure which would not otherwise be incurred, will be limited to the annual amountsshown below against each country:  If the Governments concerned can be persuaded to devote to British book importsany part of the local currency spent by Her Majesty&apos;s Government on normalofficial purposes, any such sum should be regarded as additional to the figuresquoted above subject to a limit of 50 per cent, in each case. This would mean that,whereas1 Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ liability for the acceptance of blockedcurrency or additional local expenditure would be limited to a total of  330,000 perannum, the total import of books into the countries through B.B.E. schemes could in the most favourable circumstances be increased up to  495,000.19. In negotiating these schemes, it is recommended that the following further points should be borne in mind:  (a) since the object of a book export scheme is to increase the number ofBritish books entering the country concerned, it is desirable that an assurance should be obtained in the course of negotiations that the books exported under the scheme would be additional to, and notmerely in replacement of, normal commercial exports;(b) as regards the general character of the material to be supplied under these schemes, it is important to avoid too restrictive a policy. The object isto cater for a legitimate demand for British reading matter over a wide* This would be conditional on a contribution being made by Jewish voluntary bodies in theUnited Kingdom.

field. Our agreements with the various Governments should thereforeprovide for the admission of any books which can reasonably beregarded as having an educational, scientific, technical or cultural value.This description could of course open the door to many undesirablepublications. It would therefore seem necessary to add the proviso thatthe supply of books under the scheme should be in the mutual interest ofthe two countries. This proviso would not be used to justify pre-censorship, but would give us the right to terminate a scheme if it wereconsistently abused and the Government concerned showed itselfunable or unwilling to prevent such abuse;(c) the word &quot; books &quot; should be applied in a broad sense to cover sales of books, subscriptions to periodicals, sales of translation rights, royaltieson local printing of British publications and sales of certain English-language gramophone records of United Kingdom origin.20. The mechanics of the operation would be on the lines indicated in annex A (based on a scheme which the Foreign Office was authorised to negotiate with Turkey, but which has not yet materialised).21. In addition to the above proposals, the Working Party recommendthat authority be given for the expenditure of up to  10,000 on arrangements tofacilitate the import of British books into Chile. The main impediment hitherto hasbeen the Chilean regulation which requires importers to pay heavy deposits inadvance. This difficulty could be overcome by establishing a revolving fund of thesum named, but we understand that the regulations are being altered and the requirement of advance deposits is being replaced by one of surcharges. The precisenature of the new regulations is not yet known but their effect on books may be equally restrictive.22. In concluding this section of the report, the Working Party wish to draw attention to the steps that the United States Government has been taking to increasethe sale of American books in countries which would normally be precluded byexchange difficulties from buying them. Their principal instrument is theI.M.G. programme, which is based largely on the use of counterpart fundsagainst existing economic aid programmes, though it does in some casesinvolve the acceptance of blocked currency on a large scale. In the firstnine years (1949-57) of the operation of the I.M.G. programme the net cost to theUnited States taxpayer has been calculated at something in the region of  5 m.including the value of currencies held in blocked accounts. To the extent that thesebooks provide an alternative to Communist or other literature hostile to the West,the American effort is greatly to be welcomed on political grounds. But it is clearlyimportant that we too should play our part, particularly in those countries where,given the choice, the reading public would turn more readily to British than to american sources of supply and United Kingdom prestige would be therebyenhanced. Moreover, the Americans have confined their programme largely to american titles, thus leaving the bulk of literature in the English languageuntouched. For these reasons alone it would be bad policy to treat the Americaneffort as a substitute for our own.Low-Priced Book Programme23. The countries where low purchasing power is a problem are in the maincountries where a widespread knowledge&apos;of the English language combines with ahistorical connexion with Britain to make it natural that British literature shouldbe the first choice from outside sources. They are, moreover, countries in the early stages of political evolution, in need of and responsive to the influence of maturercountries, but sensitive about the way in which it is exerted. There can be no moreunobtrusive method of exerting our influence than the dissemination of Britishbooks and periodicals. While the subsidisation of any export is also contrary toour commercial policy, the proposed arrangements can again be regarded as a formof aid rather than as subsidised commercial exports. We are not seeking to betterour books sales at the expense of our commercial competitors but to bring vitalinformation about ourselves to people who cannot otherwise afford to acquire it.This would be an important enough objective to justify special action even withoutthe threat posed by literature from Communist sources.   But the threat is very
relevant and a powerful argument against delay on our part. In short, the purposeof a book subsidisation scheme is, by providing suitable literature at attractiveprices, to extend British influence in certain areas which are still receptive to thatinfluence, and thus to help build up defences against a hostile propaganda strategyof which subsidised book exports form an important part.24. A summary of available information on the Russian and Chineseactivities in the field of cheap books is at Annex B. The following points should benoted:  (i) It would be misleading to suggest that the character and content of theEnglish-language material with which the Russians and the Chinese areflooding the Asian markets, particularly India, are immediately harmfulto our political interests. The real danger (and indeed the underlyingpurpose) of this voluminous output of English-language publications isthat it creates a pattern of supply and channels of distribution whichmay well perpetuate themselves and are already serving to carry agradually increasing element of propagandist literature.(ii) Though the output of English language publications from Peking is on animpressive scale, probably their most effective line is the provision oflavishly-produced material in Chinese designed to play on the nostalgiaand irredentism of Chinese communities overseas. This is difficultground on which to compete, and experience must be gained elsewherebefore we attempt to do so.(iii) Literature from Communist sources has not yet on the whole penetratedColonial territories to the same extent as elsewhere either in Africaor in Asia (with the exception of Hong Kong and Singapore). But the threat is a real one. The recent formation in Moscow of an Institutefor the study of African languages and cultures is an indication of soviet intention to step up their propaganda in that area. AlreadySoviet publications are increasingly reaching selected recipients throughthe post. Here the best defence against hostile political penetrationby the printed word is clearly that the reading habits of the very largenumbers of people now becoming literate should be formed (and directed towards British sources) while Her Majesty&apos;s Government isstill in a position to influence the local Governments&apos; policies.(iv) In the Middle East the monopoly enjoyed by Cairo is the main cause for concern, though literature from Communist sources, both in Arabicand English, is increasing. While there is no evidence that the Cairopublishing industry is subsidised, its products sell at moderate prices.Literacy is running ahead of purchasing power and books in this arearemain a relative luxury. If we are to sell alternative literature it willhave to be at low prices.25. A summary by the United States authorities of their operations in this fieldis at Annex C. This American effort is welcome, but the considerations inparagraph 22 above apply here also. It is in the Western interest that we shouldreinforce the American effort (they are indeed anxious that we should do so). It isin the national interest that British influence should be extended by these means.26. The Working Party are satisfied that on political grounds action by theGovernment is necessary to meet the situation discussed above and that there isno effective alternative to subsidisation. They recommend that besides expenditureon publications in the English language substantial provision should also be madefor vernacular publishing.Low-Priced English Language Publications27. So far as English language publications are concerned, the working party propose the introduction of a low-priced book programme of which theessential features would be as follows.28. In general character and purpose the books to be subsidised should notbe overtly anti-Communist, but they must illustrate or convey implicitly andpersuasively the British ethos and the values and achievements of democracy in britain and the Commonwealth. Some would be classics of English literature,contemporary novels, and children&apos;s books.   Some would be textbooks.  Others
would cover a wide range of subjects, including, for example, short popular booksin the field of science, medicine, aviation and modern inventions (none of whichshould be limited to British achievements); travel, adventure, history and biography,and books by British authors about the target countries.29. The books would be sold, not given away. Readers put much more valueon the books that they buy than on give-away material. But the prices must below enough to attract many buyers. They would vary, but the Working Party hashad in mind a general selling price of around 9d. or Is. This means of course that the books would be paper backed. They must not be too long to make apocket-sized book of 192 pages or at most 256 pages.30. The main emphasis should be on existing books, but special books couldoccasionally be commissioned. Provision should also be made for producingsimplified texts of existing books suitable for the less advanced students of English.31. The selection of books would obviously have to be made with the greatest care, taking into account the tastes and susceptibilities of the target countries andthe relationship between the sales appeal of the books and their information value.This process of selection may be expected to attract critical attention at home andit is important that it should be seen to be carried out on the advice of people whocommand the confidence of the informed public. It is accordingly suggested thata preliminary list of titles should be drawn up by an Advisory committee consisting of non-officials suitably qualified for this task (see paragraph 63 below).From this list the three Overseas Departments would select the titles best suited to their respective territories. It would, however, be open to any overseas department to select a title not included in the preliminary list drawn up by theAdvisory Committee.32. The titles having been selected by the Overseas Departments, the central office of Information, acting on their behalf, would offer contracts to the publishersof the titles chosen. If the publisher of a given title were himself a paper-backpublisher, he would complete the job. If he were a member of a consortium ofpublishers including a paper-back publisher, the latter would do the work. Inother cases the publisher of the title would contract with a paper-back publisher ofhis own choice.33. Distribution would as far as possible be through the publisher^ normal channels. It may later be necessary to consider the creation of additional channels.34. The Government would fix a retail price and allow appropriate terms for the distributors in consultation with the publishers, paying the net cost incurred in retailing the book under these conditions.35. An arrangement on the lines of paragraphs 28-34 would, it is thought, be acceptable to the Publishers&apos; Association, with whom the whole matter has beendiscussed. While opposed in principle to subsidisation, they have recognised thatan exceptional situation needs exceptional measures and are prepared to co-operate in carrying them out. It should be noted, however, that in practice their attitudewill greatly depend on the decisions taken on the Book Export Schemes, whichare their prime interest.36. On the recommendations of the Overseas Departments, the working party have selected certain countries in which they consider that the distributionof low-priced British publications in English would be to our political advantage.They have also, after consultation with the United Kingdom posts abroad and colonial Governments as appropriate and after scrutiny both of the pattern ofUnited States operations in this field and of sales data provided by the Publishers&apos;Association, attempted to estimate the sums of money which could usefully be spent on subsidised books in the various territories, taking into account the politicalneeds and the absorptive capacity of each. These sums have been calculated on theassumption that the cost to Her Majesty&apos;s Government of each book would be approximately Is. 6d. The results are set out in the following paragraph. It shouldbe emphasised that in a changing world there can be no finality about the choice of countries and that, given the many imponderables, the figures should be regardedas valid for planning purposes only. The importance of flexibility in theapplication of all the measures proposed in this report is stressed in paragraphs 66and 67 below.
37. The Working Party accordingly recommend annual financial provisionfor publications in English as follows:  Foreign office commonwealth RelationsOfficeColonial Office South-East Asia (Burma, Indonesia, Thailand,Vietnam)       ............... 22,000Middle East and Africa (Iran, Lebanon, Sudan,Ethiopia, Somalia)   ............. 8,000India      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 50,000Pakistan.................. 15,000Malaya   .................. 10,000Ceylon    ...............      ... 10,000Central Africa............... 7,500Ghana     ...      ............... 5,000West African territories        ......... 16,000East African territories, Mauritius and Zanzibar 8,000Aden and Somaliland Protectorate  ...      ... 1,000Far Eastern territories and Fiji       ...... 10,000Total       ............... 162,500It is estimated that for this total sum of  162,500 it should be possible to put intocirculation almost 2 million books. This may be compared with an estimated total of about 5 million books produced by the Americans under their low-pricedbook programme since 1957. Exact figures for the Soviet output of cheap booksare not available but it is understood that in 1958 approximately 4 million bookswere imported into India alone from the USSR.Low-Priced Vernacular Publications38. It is also essential to institute a vernacular programme to which the same principles and procedures would apply so far as possible and which would cater for the needs of those who would not be reached by the English languageprogramme.39. In the Middle East a substantial effort to offset the undue influence ofthe Cairo publishing industry in the field of Arabic puolications is clearly called for. So long as the bulk of reading matter in the Arabic language comes from cairo, this must add to Nasser&apos;s prestige. Moreover, there is in circulation muchtendentious literature, including textbooks, which seeks to undermine the positionof the Western Powers. A fairly sophisticated readership might be assumed inthis area, and the aim should be to provide, in addition to fiction, a reasonableproportion of books for readers having a general, as opposed to specialist, interestin, e.g., social and economic subjects. Distribution would in the first instancebe to the Persian Gulf, Jordan, the Sudan, Libya, Tunisia and Morocco but couldbe extended if political conditions permit to the United Arab Republic and Iraq.40. In the Indian sub-continent, Ceylon and Malaya, the absence of any british contribution in the vernacular field is keenly felt by our High Commissioners.Substantial provision should be made to meet this need. Opinions differ howeveras to the relative importance of the various languages and as to the types of booksto be covered. To have any impact the operation will need to be on a large scale,and in view of this, of the importance of the area and of the sensitivity of theGovernments concerned, it is considered that requirements, at any rate in theIndian sub-continent, should be investigated on the spot by a Mission consisting ofrepresentatives of the Commonwealth Relations Office, Central Office ofInformation, the British Council and the Publishers Association. Meanwhilesufficient evidence is already available to justify provision on the scale recommended in paragraph 42 below.41. In the Colonial territories there is a large potential market for simpleinstructional material of the &quot; do it yourself &quot; kind as well as straight recreationalreading matter of a fairly simple nature. To begin with, particular attention shouldbe directed to publications in the former class. In some Colonial territoriesGovernments have made a start in this field through Vernacular LiteratureBureaux but these efforts would need to be supplemented.
42. On this basis the Working Party recommend annual financial provisionfor low-priced vernacular publications as follows (Chinese is excluded at this stagefor the reason given in paragraph 24 (ii) above):  Foreign Office   .........     50,000 for Arabic publicationsCommonwealth Relations Office.    50,000 for publications in Hindi, Urdu, Malay, Sinhala,Tamil, possibly Indian and Pakistani regionallanguages7,500 for vernacular publications in Central AfricaColonial Office.........     15,000 for Swahili and Arabic publications5,000 for vernacular publications in Borneo, Bruneiand Sarawak5,000 for Hindi and Urdu publications for Fiji,-    Mauritius and the East African territoriesTotal      .........    132,500British CouncilPresentations of Books and Periodicals43. Presentations cannot be regarded as a substitute for any of the other measures recommended in this report, but they are a valuable supplement. they provide the most rapid method of getting British publications into the librariesof overseas universities, technical colleges, teacher training colleges, schools, &amp;c,where they are likely to reach the maximum number of readers, many of themteachers or students who cannot afford to buy for themselves. Multiple copiesof standard textbooks may be included. The periodicals would be mainly medical,scientific, technological, scholarly and educational. They would include thepublications of learned societies which are of vital importance in this field. Somepresentations should be made to individuals in positions of influence. Carefulselection of the right recipients and the right books and periodicals, and consultationwith the local educational authorities concerned, are essential if misdirection of effort is to be avoided. The British Council can perform this service, through its representatives, librarians and education officers overseas, and the specialistdepartments and bibliographical libraries which it maintains at its Londonheadquarters. For practical reasons it is not possible at this stage to separatefinancial provision for presentations from that required for the other measuresby the British Council proposed in paragraphs 44 to 46 below. The total sumproposed for these British Council services will be found in paragraph 48.Libraries and Library Services44. There are countries in which presentations of books and periodicals onany considerable scale are either out of the question because appropriate librariesdo not exist or undesirable because libraries are unsatisfactory. The need canbe met, however, if the books and periodicals are added to Council libraries, wherethey can be effectively administered, and lent by post or circulated in book-boxesif needed.  Multiple copies of textbooks can be included for long loan to students.45. Council libraries can also facilitate the sale of British reading matterthrough normal trade channels by helping prospective buyers over the very realproblem of selection. There are some 300,000 books in print in Britain, and 20,000more appear every year. And there are some 5,000 periodicals (apart fromnewspapers), many of them highly specialised. This wealth and variety, unequalledanywhere else in the world, provide Britain with an invaluable stock-in-trade, butit can obviously be very difficult for the overseas librarian, bookseller, specialist,professional man or student to find the publications best suited to his needs. Theproblem is acute in many developing areas where even the best libraries andbookshops may not possess anything like the necessary skill or the reference books.In the nature of things no book-trade agency can provide an expert authoritativeservice. British Council libraries provide such a service on a restricted scale,answering every year thousands of enquiries about books and periodicals, andsupplying expert bibliographies ad hoc on a great range of subjects.46. In very many places also there is no local publicity for new Britishpublications, and no opportunity to examine books and periodicals before orderingthem, except when these are provided by the British CounciFs review scheme andexhibitions. The extension of these services would be one of the most effective and economical methods of increasing the use and the sales of British publications.
47. These presentations or the other Council services are being expanded orinitiated in 1959-60 in India, Pakistan, Ceylon, the Somaliland Protectorate, Aden,Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Somalia, Burma, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.The cost of this expansion is about  200,000. There will be a continuing needfor these activities in all these countries.48. A similar expansion would be very valuable in Ghana, Nigeria, malaya and other Commonwealth countries and in Indonesia, Thailand, Nepal, Korea,Sudan, Ethiopia, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia and Libya. While inLatin America the political need for an increase in British Council presentationsand library services is not so pressing, the commercial benefit of an increased provision there especially for periodicals would be considerable.. Expansion inLatin America is therefore recommended if resources permit. The Working Partyrecommend that  100,000 per annum be made available to the British Council forthese purposes. Of this total  70,000 should be allocated to foreign countries, 20,000 to Commonwealth countries, and  10,000 to Colonial territories.Development of Library Systems in Colonial Territories49. In many of the Colonial territories, although purchasing power as elsewhere is a limiting factor, the position is complicated by the fact that literacyhas grown a great deal faster than the distributive system. The petty trader is virtually the only commercial distributive agent apart from the few bookshops in large urban areas and he is at present unwilling and unable to handle suchcomparatively expensive, heavy and, in tropical climates, perishable commodities as books.50. The low-priced book scheme described in paragraphs 23 to 42 will undoubtedly give an impetus to the development of commercial book distributionby giving the entrepreneur a chance of building up a mass market and meanwhileprotecting him against some of the commercial risks involved. But this is expectedto be a comparatively slow process.51. Meanwhile the dissemination of books in the territories concerned is seriously inhibited by the lack of adequate public library systems. SomeGovernments, within the limited financial resources available to them for thepurpose, have made a start with establishing public libraries. But not much has yet been done outside the large urban centres. Even the existing libraries, moreover,need far more English books and are having, at the moment, to rely too much on,e.g., American donations. Adequate services would in general need to comprisecentral libraries, regional branches, book vans and book boxes, on the lines ofthe system established in Ghana before independence.52. Services of this kind, besides enabling a large number of people to borrowBritish books, could also provide sales points in areas where commercial channelsdo not exist. In some territories it would also be advantageous to extend the limitedbook van service at present operated in connexion with the Literature Bureaux.53. The Working Party recommend that the terms of reference of the british council in the Colonial territories as laid down in paragraph 14 of the enclosureto the Secretary of State for the Colonies circular despatch No. 97511 of August 9,1948, be revised to permit the Council to organise, without prejudice to its other work, the improvement and expansion of Colonial library services in collaboration with the Colonial Governments concerned. The Council has already successfullycarried out operations of this kind in Jamaica and in Ghana. An undertaking from the Colonial Governments concerned to meet in due course the recurrentcosts of expanded services would be a prior condition of any expansion scheme.It is further recommended that the Council be invited to submit costed proposals to a maximum of  100,000 a year for schemes of this kind covering a period ofyears in accordance with a list of priorities to be decided by the Colonial Office,in consultation with Colonial Governments and the Council. The area to be covered by such projects would include territories in West, East and Central Africa,South-East Asia, the Somaliland Protectorate, Mauritius, and Fiji.Improvement of Commercial Distribution54. Both in the countries which the Working Party has considered and outside them, there remains great need and scope for improvement in the normal commercial merchandising of British books and periodicals.  This is particularly
true where there are no artificial barriers (such as quotas and tariffs). Eventhough some of the countries concerned may be poor by Western standards, thereis evidence of a considerable demand for books at commercial prices which isnot being met. In some cases this is probably due to publishers&apos; difficulties in finding suitable channels of distribution and to distributors&apos; unwillingness to acceptundefined risks in an unfamiliar field. Elsewhere the obstacle may be the lackof prospect of adequate returns.55. If the Working Party&apos;s recommendations are accepted, it would be useful to discuss with publishers and distributors precisely what the obstacles areand what steps can be taken to overcome them. For example, an approach tosome of the leading commercial houses operating in Africa and some of the leadingUnited Kingdom book-selling organisations might well bring about a joint effort in the retail book trade in certain Colonial territories. By thus marryingexperience in large-scale local marketing with retail book trade &quot; know how,&quot; itshould be possible to achieve a considerable increase in the distribution of Britishbooks at little direct cost to public funds.Measures to Promote the Circulation of British Periodicals and NewspapersOverseas56. The Working Party are convinced that a very much wider distributionof certain British periodicals and newspapers overseas is in the national interest,particularly for their value in stimulating an intelligent appreciation of the british attitude to current problems. Free distribution already takes place through officialchannels, but this has hitherto been on a limited scale. Provision has been madefor distribution on a larger scale in certain countries in 1959-60. The working party fully support this and consider that still greater expenditure would be justified.Since this is an existing service, provision for expanding it could most appropriately be sought by the Departments concerned in the normal way at the time of preparing the annual Estimates. The Working Party need therefore do no more than record their view that money spent in this way would be well spent.57. The problem to which the Working Party has particularly addresseditself is that of promoting the sale of British periodicals and newspapers overseas.The nub of the problem is the heavy incidence of transport costs, which deter the publishers from testing the strength of the demand in overseas markets. In someat least of these markets sales could probably be built up in course of time to aprofitable level. But the venture is understandably regarded as speculative by the publishers, whose profits in the home market are not such as to encourage anadventurous policy abroad.58. The Working Party have examined the possibility of obtainingconcessionary airmail rates, but there are difficulties which have not been resolvedand no firm recommendation can yet be made. The matter would repay furtherattention at a later stage.59. Meanwhile members of the Periodical Proprietors&apos; Association and the publishers of air mail editions of newspapers and weekly periodicals would welcome an experimental scheme designed to help them to establish themselves in selectedmarkets considered to be of political importance to Her Majesty&apos;s Government.The essence of the proposed arrangement is that the publications would be selected in consultation with the publishers who would provide copies free or at a nominal charge. The Central Omce of Information would despatch the air maileditions of newspapers and periodicals by air freight and the remainder by surfacepost. The cost of surface postage would be borne by the Government but the publishers of air mail editions would contribute about one-third of the cost ofair freight. The local agent in the receiving country would make no payment for these publications during an experimental period but would be required tomeet internal distribution costs and to promote sales. The local selling prices wouldbe agreed with publishers and would be such as to enable normal business tocontinue thereafter on a basis acceptable to them. The experimental period inany country selected would vary according to the circumstances.60. The publishers consider that an experimental scheme along these lines would help them to test the market in the areas Her Majesty&apos;s Government has inmind and with a reasonable prospect of success. An annual allocation of  20,000,to be reviewed after two years, is recommended for this purpose.
Illustrated Magazine61. The Working Party have noted the advantage enjoyed by certain countries whose economies, for one reason or another, are able to support commercialperiodicals of relatively low price which, besides achieving large sales at home,lend themselves more or less effectively also to the projection overseas of thecountries in question. While the Working Party would not feel justified in advisinggovernmental intervention in the field of domestic publishing, they recommend that further study should be given by officials to the problem of competing overseas withthe foreign periodicals in question. They recognise in any event that a low-pricedpopular illustrated magazine of United Kingdom origin, designed primarily for the oversea reader and especially for the impecunious student, might powerfullysupplement the measures proposed elsewhere in this Report for promoting thesale of general reading matter in the territories which the Working Party havebeen called upon to consider. It should be noted that the production of such amagazine, if it were to have any real impact, would be likely to cost something of the order of  500,000 per annum.TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS62. The Working Party have considered the organisation that would benecessary to carry out the proposals in this report and recommend that a Committeeshould be set up under the aegis of the Official Committee on Overseas information services to be callecr the Book Exports Committee. The Chair would be taken bythe Office of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Committee would consist of representatives of the Foreign, Commonwealth Relations and ColonialOffices, the Board of Trade, the Central Office of Information and the british council. While ultimate responsibility would rest with the sponsoring departments,the Committee would provide a forum for all discussions involving policy. Itwould guide the deployment of resources for the low-priced book programme and would seek to ensure proper co-ordination and balance between this programme,the book export schemes and the other measures proposed in this report. It would act as the normal channel betv/een the Government and the Publishers&apos; association and the Periodical Proprietors&apos; Association whenever either party considered that questions of policy needed discussion.63. The need for an Advisory Committee to assist in the selection of titles forthe low-priced book programme has been mentioned in paragraph 31 above. Thiscommittee should have an independent chairman and should comprise experts in various fields, including some members of the British CounciFs advisorycommittees on British Books Overseas, and on Science, Medicine, &amp;c. Itssecretariat would be provided jointly by the Central Office of Information and theBritish Council. Appraisals of books suggested should be obtained from experts in the United Kingdom, from the overseas representatives, librarians and educational officers of the British Council and from British Embassies and HighCommissions.64. The administration of book export schemes, of the low-priced bookprogramme, and of the proposals for encouraging the sale of newspapers and periodicals overseas would be carried out by the Central Office of Information,while the expansions proposed in the presentation and library programmes wouldbe operated by the British Council, both under the general direction of the overseas departments. The two bodies would work closely together on the execution of theprogramme as a whole.65. A Book Trade Consultative Panel would be set up by the Book ExportsCommittee and would contain representatives of the different book trade interestslikely to be concerned with low-priced books and with book export schemes. Itwould advise the Book Exports Committee and the Central Office of Information onpractical book trade matters connected with the execution of approved schemes.
(paragraphs 43-48)      100,000CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS66. An effort of the general order of magnitude envisaged in this report isnecessary if British reading matter is to hold its own in the areas examined. TheWorking Party cannot in the nature of things claim that the proposed distributionof the total sum as between the various schemes and countries is valid in anyabsolute sense. It can only be claimed that the provisions suggested in each caseare as realistic as can be expected from the application of careful judgment toevidence which, though the best available, inevitably includes a large element ofopinion.  Forecasts of likely demand have proved particularly difficult.67. The importance of flexibility in the operation of these schemes needs to be most strongly emphasised. It is essential that the Book Exports Committee shouldhave authority to switch resources from one country to another and from onescheme to another as changes in demand or political emphasis may require.68. Subject to this proviso, the Working Party recommend the followingschemes at the annual net estimated cost noted against each (it is recognised thatit would not be possible to reach this level of expenditure for at least one year):   (a) British Book Export Schemes (paragraphs 12-22)      ...      340,000(b) Low-priced Book Programmes (paragraphs 23-42)(i) English language (paragraph 37)   ......      ...      162,500(ii) vernacular languages (paragraph 42)      ...      ...      132,500(c) book and periodical presentations&quot;)by the British Council(d) expansion    of   British    Councillibraries and services(e) development of library systems in Colonial territories(paragraphs 49-53)       ...............      100,000(/) measures to promote the sale of British periodicals and newspapers overseas (paragraphs 59 and 60)  ...      ...       20,000Total       ..................      855,000It must be added that the Treasury representative, while not dissenting fromthe general conclusion that a case existed for action on these lines, has made it clear to the Working Party that his Department cannot be regarded as committed to expenditure on the scale proposed.69.   In addition to the above, the Working Party recommend:  (a) discussions with the publishers with a view to improving commercialdistributive arrangements in certain countries (paragraphs 54 and 55);(b) further study of the question of concessionary airmail rates for periodicals(paragraph 58);(c) further study of the project for an illustrated magazine (paragraph 61).
Annex A(See paragraph 20)PROPOSED OPERATION OF A BOOK EXPORT scheme the method of operation would be as follows:  (1) A selected list of not more than 20 reputable firms of local booksellers andwholesalers would be invited to participate in the scheme on the basisof agreed quarterly deposits of local currency paid in advance either in one sum or in monthly instalments to the designated agent (e.g., theBritish Council representatives). The total of such agreed quarterlydeposits should not exceed pro rata the annual ceiling for the Scheme.(2) Booksellers&apos; deposits would be notified to the Central Office of Information(C.O.I.) by the designated agent, and the sterling equivalent transferredto the C.O.I. by the Foreign Office.(3) The local importer would send orders to the CO.I in duplicate on a standard order form obtained from the designated agent.(4) The C.O.I. would pass orders to British publishers.(5) The British publisher would (i) despatch the books, periodicals, &amp;c, orderedwith a copy of the invoice direct to the local importer who would,however, have been advised that his total obligation would include anadditional percentage of x per cent, to cover administrative costs and(ii) send an invoice to the C.O.I. for settlement.(6) The CO.I. would maintain records of the deposits made by local booksellersand of payments made on their behalf; the records would also includethe percentage administrative charge. Once a quarter, the C.O.I. wouldsupply each bookseller with a statement of his account which would include an estimate of the cost of outstanding orders for which invoiceshad not been received. It is proposed that these statements of account- should be submitted in the last fortnight of each quarter and, at thesame time, the [Turkish] importers invited to make their &quot; bid &quot; by acertain date for allocations covering the ensuing quarter. On that date the next quarter&apos;s money (i.e.,  12,000) would be allocated among the applications received probably on a pro rata basis but also taking into account any special recommendations from the Embassy and theBritish Council and giving preference to booksellers specialising incertain types of books and periodicals, e.g., English language text books and medical periodicals.(7) Each quarter the CO.I. would provide the designated agent with a comprehensive statement showing the volume of trade since the lastreturn. These returns might be submitted to the local Governmentand used as a basis for determining the limits of the scheme for the next financial year.
Annex B(See paragraph 24)RUSSIAN AND CHINESE EXPORTS OF CHEAP BOOKSBook Production of the Bloc countries the Soviet Union, with an annual production rate of 1 -1 billion books and aprojected rate of 1 - 6 billion by 1965, maintains that it is the world&apos;s leading producer of books. Without openly disputing the Soviet claim that they are number one inthe field, the Chinese Communists claim that they produce 2 billion copies.Following these giants of the book world are the smaller Communist States of east Germany with 100 million books, Poland with 86-9 million, Czechoslovakiawith 42-5 million, Roumania with 36-5 million, Hungary with 31-4 million and north Vietnam with 9 million.Within the bloc, the USSR is the undisputed leading producer of books inforeign languages, however. During 1958, it published nearly 30 million booksin Free World languages.   These books were distributed by languages as follows:  Book Production of the Soviet Union in Free World Languages 1958Language	No. of Titles	No. of CopieGerman	173	12,677.300English         ......	......      258	11,560,600French         ......	117	2,329,000Bengali        ......	......        17	217,500Spanish	......       32	149,700Hindi.........	......       19	146,800Arabic	......        13	81,500Finnish	......        25	55,500Persian	7	44,600Urdu.........	......         9	38.000Dutch.........	.:. -   ...      5	28,400Swedish        ......	......         4	17,000Esperanto	......         1	10,000Japanese       ......	......         2	9,500Kurdish        ......	......         4	4,000Norwegian	......         1	2,500Totals    ......	......      687	27,371,900As noted above the USSR published 687 titles of books in a total print of27,371,900 copies in Free World languages. This represents a decline of 1,929,500copies from the 1957 figure of 701 titles in 29,301,400 copies. This decrease in total output is more than accounted for by a drop of 2,036,690 in output of German-language books. A continuing decline in Soviet production of German-languagebooks has been noted for some time. In 1954 the Soviets published 16,802,000copies of German-language books as compared with 12,677,300 copies in 1958.This decline in Soviet production should not be attributed to a declining interestin German-speaking people as a target for Communist propaganda, however, but rather to the fact that the East German Presses have increasingly assumed theburden of publishing Marxist-Leninist books in the German language. The outputof these books commonly called Marxist-Leninist classics totalled 23 millioncopies during a recent one-year period. Also, it is significant that the publishinghouse &quot; Volk und Wissen,&quot; which until late 1957 published educational andtechnical literature exclusively, was removed from the control of the Ministry ofPublic Education and placed under the Ministry of Cultural Affairs.Communist China, another bloc country with a large book publishing and export programme, reportedly planned to produce two billion copies of books in1958. Although it is not known how many of these were to be in foreign languages,exports of two million copies to India alone, for example, suggest that the number was substantial. However, there were indications that the foreign language bookpublishing programme is growing. The October 1958 French catalogue of GuoziShudian of Peking lists 122 titles offered for export as compared with 34 titles inits 1957 catalogue.   There were also reports that two Spanish translators from
Latin America had been added to the Spanish section of the Foreign LanguagesPublishing House. During 1958 this firm also added an Indian languagespublishing programme to its regular programme of publishing in English,Indonesian, French, Spanish and German. The main effort, however, in terms ofvolume of books exported, consists of Chinese-language books directed to overseasChinese throughout the world. Millions of copies of these books are exportedannually through the distribution centres of Hong Kong and Singapore.Similarly, a large portion of the exports of other bloc countries is directedtoward emigres residing in various countries throughout the world. A catalogueput out by Ars Polona of Warsaw and distributed at the Second United StatesWorld Trade Fair in New York in 1958 lists over 300 titles of Polish books forexport. Furthermore, the Polish programme of publishing in foreign languagesis expanding, judging from their export statistics. In 1956 the value of bookexports reached 2-9 million zlotys; in 1957 it was 3-3 million zlotys; the plan for1958 called for an increase to 5-8 million zlotys.Books Printed for Free distribution in addition to those books listed above on which information on the numberof copies printed is available, the USSR prints a large number of books andpamphlets for free distribution. There are no figures available on the number of copies of these produced. Soviet Book Herald noted about 150 titles fallingunder this category put out in Free World languages. The output of these in termsof number of copies produced probably exceeds all other printings combined.Thus to cite an example the USSR had up to one hundred titles available forvisitors to the Brussels Fair in 1958. Since, according to Soviet sources, over30 million people visited the Soviet pavilion, the number of copies handed outprobably ran into the millions. East Germany, moreover, recently published abook for free distribution supporting Soviet policy in Europe. Entitled WhiteBook on the Aggressive Policy of the German Federal Republic, it has been givento the Governments of more than 60 countries and contains documents presented to the World Press at Press conferences held in East Berlin, Prague and Moscow.The following offer was made in Democratic German Report, November 21,1958:-The White Book, a volume of 160 pages, deals in sober terms with thefollowing subjects:  Atomic Weapons for West GermanySteps taken since 1950 to. Restore German MilitarismWest German Demands for Frontier RevisionThe Forces which Oppose German ReunificationThe Peace Policy of Democratic Germany.If you would like a free copy of this volume, fill in the form on the right.Your copy will be dispatched as soon as the English edition comes off thepress.While this is an example of a book printed specifically for free distribution,the prices of all Communist books appear to be so low that the price received doesnot cover postage costs. To cite an extreme example: a number of works byMao Tse-tung published in such languages as English, French, German andIndonesian can be ordered from Guozi Shudian of Peking for two cents in UnitedStates money. Titles in this category include: Combat Liberalism; The PolvchesKMeasures and Perspectives of Combating Japanese Invasion; and The Questionof Autonomy within the United Front. With such a pricing policy the only,apparent reason for asking any remuneration for these books is to avoid the chargeof distributing free propaganda. In fact, the prices of all Communist books appearto be just high enough to convince the purchaser that he is getting somethingworthwhile and low enough to make him believe he is getting a bargain. This&quot; optimum &quot; price is usually about one-fifth the cost of a commercially pricedvolume.Expansion of Bloc Publication facilities in order to meet the growing receptivity to their literature abroad, the bloc.countries have found it necessary to expand their publishing facilities, and, insome cases, to create entirely new publishing houses devoted largely to the
publication of books for foreign circulation. The East Germans to cite an example have set up a printing plant in North Vietnam with a capacity of nine millionvolumes annually, thus doubling the publishing capacity of that country. TheEast Germans have also established a publishing house of their own to print booksprimarily for export. According to the G.D.R. Review No. 7, 1958, &quot; 80 per cent,of the new company&apos;s output in books is scheduled for export, mainly to English-speaking countries, of which India and the Middle East will be the chief buyers.&quot;A brochure from this Berlin firm, called &quot; Seven Seas Books,&quot; lists a numberof titles in English that can be ordered. These books, for the most part reprints,are the works of writers who addressed themselves to social problems existing intheir time. For the reader who is not familiar wth the Western scene, MarkTwain might be shocking and Jane Austen&apos;s Pride and Prejudice easilymisinterpreted. The choice of titles forms a pattern designed to provide uncriticalminds with arguments to confirm the Communist version of a capitalistic society.Prices range from DM. 1 - 85 for single volumes to DM.2 - 85 for double volumes.From the Soviet Union has come a report that Lithuanian physicistshave solved the problem of making magnetic printing forms by photoelectric means,thus, according to a Tass broadcast, revolutionising the printing industry. Theprotoype of a ferromagnetic printing machine involving this process, which willdispense with the conventional technique of printing by means of mechanicalimpression, has been built at a laboratory of the Lithuanian Research Institute ofElectrography at Vilnyus. Reportedly this permits the printing of books, magazinesand newspapers in large impressions without type and matrices, and printingmachines with ferromagnetic film can, in a few minutes, print books in enormousimpressions.The Seven-Year Plan of the USSR for expanding the printing and publishingindustry provides for the expenditure of 3,125,800,000 roubles by 1965.According to the latest reports from Communist China, seven publishinghouses were established during the first six months of 1958, thus bringing the totalof printing establishments to 134.Addition of New Languages to Publishing programme the Soviet foreign language publishing programme, which for a number ofyears has included the principal languages of the Free World, underwent further expansion during 1958. Additional languages added include Portuguese, Persian,Kurdish and Tamil. Books, periodicals and textbooks destined for domestic andforeign consumption have appeared in these languages. The domestic market wassupplied with a Portuguese-Russian phrase book, and foreign readers in Iran, tocite one example, were given an opportunity to read in Persian about Sovietmethods of handling the malaria problem. Several delightful children&apos;s books havealso been added to the Soviet Persian-language output.Dictionaries, textbooks and phrase books were in the forefront of Sovietpublishing endeavours during the year. They appeared in almost all of the newlanguages mentioned. Increased cultural contacts and greater emphasis upon the teaching of foreign languages in Soviet schools may have been partly responsiblefor this new publishing effort.
Annex C(See paragraph 25)UNITED STATES LOW-PRICED BOOK PROGRAMMEIntroductionAmerican books at prices within the reaoh of the masses of literates in mostof the Asian and African countries are beginning to find their way into the bookstands of those countries in increasing numbers as a result of a new book activitysponsored and directed by the United States Information Agency. This new bookeffort is known &apos;as the Low-Priced Book Programme. Working through Americanpublishers and their export representatives, we have placed well over two millionpaperback books on sale at 10 and 15 cents per copy during the past eighteen months.To make low-priced books also available to the large audience which is onlysemi-literate in English a special series of simplified versions of American booksis being prepared. This series, consisting of both fiction and non-fiction, calls forbooks to be reduced in vocabulary in levels of from 1,000 to 10,000 words by persons experienced in teaching English to foreigners. Thus, a person who knowssome English will be able to read American material and improve his English atthe same time. This series of books will be distinguished by a colophon on eachvolume inscribed &quot; A Ladder Series.&quot;PurposeThis Programme has been developed to help counter the ever-increasing flow of Communist-produced nominally priced publications to the critical areas of theworld and to make greater numbers of American books available overseas generally.In the competition for the attention of men&apos;s minds and thoughts through the medium of books, the availability of American books has become increasinglycrucial and more and more a concern of the United States Information Agency.Discouragingly small numbers of American books have been distributed in the asian and African countries through normal commercial means. The Low-PricedBook Programme looks not only to distributing selected American books insignificant quantities at prices low enough to make them available to the widereading audience but to encouraging American publishers to develop enduringdistribution channels in these countries.Types of BooksThe United States Information Agency selects all titles distributed under theLow-Priced Book Programme. These selections include a large quantity of bookswhich make a major contribution to the objectives of the United States InformationAgency and American foreign policy. Books which portray important aspects of american life and democratic institutions or which expose the aims and intentions of Soviet and international Communism receive major emphasis.

Contracts are written with American publishersunder which they prepare special paper-back export editions of selected titles whichare labelled &quot; Special Student Editions.&quot; The same contract provides for the publishers placing the books in their regular commercial distribution channels in countries and quantities designated by the Agency. (Some of the problemsencountered in trying to meet the distribution schedules will be discussed below.)As in the case of regular commercial books, these &quot; Student Editions &quot; arepurchased by distributors at discount rates. A book retailing for 10 cents is&quot;sold&quot; to the distributor for 2 cents; he, in turn, &quot;sells&quot; it to his retailers at cents, thus providing a 4 cents profit to each. All arrangements in connexionwith getting the books distributed and placed on sale are handled by the publishersand their export representatives as in the case of commercial editions. A 1 cent per copy service fee for handling distribution arrangements is paid to exportrepresentatives by the Agency through the publishers.The Agency bears the complete cost of financing the cost of manufacture,promotion, and shipping. Any funds collected by the publishers from theirdistributors (the 2 cents per copy) are deducted from the Agency&apos;s reimbursementto the publisher. In return for producing the special editions and for arrangingdistribution, the Agency pays the publisher a 5 cent per copy service fee which isexpected to cover the publishers overhead and other indirect costs.A 1 cent per copy allowance for promotional purposes is also made availableto the overseas distributor by the Agency through the publisher. How this allowance is used is left to the judgment of the distributor in each country. while he is not required to make any precise accounting to the publisher of hisexpenditures of this money, he is expected to submit sample copies of allpromotional materials purchased with it.Special ProblemsBringing about distribution of the books to the countries and in the quantitiesdesired is a fairly complicated and demanding operation. Many of the publishersare charting distribution channels in virgin territory particularly in Africa. others have had only limited experience with overseas distribution generally. No publisher
or distributor has had experience with the large quantities or the extensivedealership coverage hoped for by the Agency. Distribution is frustrated furtherby the fact that little actual control can be exercised by either the Agency or the publishers once the books have been placed in shipment.In addition to the difficulties created by the lack of extensive experience withthe areas and the kind of distribution hoped for, specific problems harass thedistribution operation. Currency exchange restrictions and regulations havehampered distribution to the dollar shortage areas. In these countries whereI.M.G. agreements are in force this difficulty has been considerably relieved.Unfortunately, I.M.G. funds for some of the countries to which distribution is planned are limited. Distribution to the African countries in the sterling bloc hasbeen hampered because no mechanism for converting pounds sterling into dollarsexists. Shipments- to those countries have been delayed since publishers havenaturally been unwilling to accept payment for the books in sterling.Distribution has been slowed also through resistance of some of thedistributors and book sellers to handle the books because of concern over the quantities recommended or doubt about the sales appeal of the particular titles.Objections have been raised, too, over the kinds of books. Some distributors havebeen concerned lest the book be viewed as overly propagandistic by consumers andtaint the whole series.Progress to DateDespite the difficulties faced in getting the books distributed in many of the target countries, real progress has been made in getting large quantities of Americanbooks placed on sale throughout the Asian continent. One American publisher inreporting on his observations in the book field generally during a recent extendedtour through India, commented that by early 1957 the Low-Priced BookProgramme had achieved real penetration of the Indian book market. He notedthat the low-priced books were available on book stands everywhere in India, Hevisited from Madras in the south to Darjeeling in the north.Through Press comments, reports received from American publisherstravelling through the area, and reports from U.S.I.S. officers in the field it has beenpossible to gain some sense of the impact made by the appearance of the low-pricedbooks. A Madras daily noted that, for the first time in India, it is possible forpoor students to build their own personal libraries. It commented favourably onthe availability at 10 and 15 cents of American political classics and hoped thatsoon some of the British classics would be available also. (At the time this articleappeared the Agency had already contracted for publication of some of thewritings of Mill, Hume and Locke.)In Japan, too, Press comment has been favourable. One of the major Tokyonewspapers welcomed the appearance of the books with the observation that, forthe first time, American books at prices directly competitive with those beingdistributed in large quantities by the Communists are being distributed in Japan.The article expressed gratification over the representative range of titles included inthe series snd stated that the series offered material in the field of economicsand political science heretofore available only through the Communist distribution.Sales in themselves have not as yet developed into a very meaningful patternbecause of the relatively short period during which the books have been on sale.But reports from India, where the books have been on sale longer than in any other country, are quite encouraging. Over half of the books placed on sale there in the spring of 1956 have been sold. Many of the titles have sold out completely and newcopies have been ordered by the distributor. As would be expected, India emergesas the largest market area for low-priced books.
