THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C.(59) S36th May, 1959AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY: REPLACEMENT OF THE DAKOTA. 1,1 emoiandua by the Minister of supply on 5th May the Cabinet invited me to provide further informationas to the form which Government financial support for a British civil aircraft suitable to replace the Douglas D.C.3 might take (C.C.(59) 28thConclusions, Minute 5).2. The most usual way of supporting a new civil type is by a contract with the manufacturer under which my Department meets thewhole or part of the cost of design and development including themanufacture and testing of prototypes.   The expenditure is normallyregarded as an investment recoverable by.means of levy payments onsubsequent sales of the aircraft.   This method would be applicable to theAvro 748 but not to the Dart Herald where the expenditure in question has already been incurred by the firm.3.        Another form of assistance would be through the purchase of early production aircraft for Government use, e.g. in R.A.F, transport command or in my own research and development establishments.   this method would be applicable to either the Avro 748 or the Dart Herald.It would give intending purchasers some assurance that developmenttesting and proving flying would be completed to Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-menfs satisfaction.    It would not, however, give the aircraft a civilcachet calculated to attract civil airlines.4.        A third method would be to negotiate with a British commercialoperator, e.g. British European Airways (B.E.A.) a contract which wouldmake it commercially attractive to introduce a few of the new type air-craft on its routes, even though B.EA-. had no genuine demand for theaircraft.   This might take the form of meeting the whole or part of thecapital cost of the aircraft or of contributing towards the expenses incurred in introducing and operating the new type, or some combination of both.   This method would also be applicable to either the Avro 748 orthe Dart Herald.   It might be said to go some way towards giving theaircraft a civil cachet, although the value of this cachet might well benullified by the fact that the home operator had no genuine demand for theaircraft.   This method would also be open to the charge of being a subsidy to the Corporation, particularly if there is any substantial element of support for normal operating costs, and its purioose of seeking to promoteexports could not be concealed.   This method would be entirely novel and both for that reason and because no provision has been made in myEstimates I am advised that a statement would have to be made toParliament.-1-COPY NO.CABINET
5.        A fourth method would be to make a financial contribution to the manufacturer to enable him in his turn to negotiate a contract with a.E.A. as under paragraph 4 above.   This would be an indirect way of achieving the same end as the previous method.   It v/ould therefore alsobe subject to the same disadvantages, with the added complication thatthe ultimate purpose of the contribution to the manufacturer would haveto be disclosed.6. On the question which of the tv/o alternative aircraft should be supported I have already put my views in CA.(59) 23.   The cabinet should, however, know that a proposal that the Herald should befinancially supported was rejected in July, 1954 on the grounds that therewas no actual or potential military or civil requirement for the aircraft in the United Kingdom, the cost of the project was within the capacity ofthe Company and its associates to find as a private venture, and that an aircraft offered by Handley Page with Alvis piston engines was toodoubtful a commercial venture to justify the investment of public funds.The project has proceeded since that date as a private venture and whenthe unsaleability of the first version of the aircraft was establishedRolls Royce turbo-prop engines were substituted for the Alvis engines.If the Government decides to give financial support now that developmentof the aircraft has been practically completed, the original decision willhave been reversed and the policy of encouraging manufacturers to risktheir own capital in private ventures will be undermined.A.J.Ministry of Supply, W.C.2.5th May, 1959-2-G..confidential
