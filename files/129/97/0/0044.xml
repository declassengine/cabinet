After further dicussion with the Prime Minister, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour, I informed the   leader    of the Local Authorities&apos; Panel of the Burnham Committeethat the Government was still unable to contemplate approval of a basicscale with a higher minimum than  510.     The Authorities had in mind to put forward  an offer including a  520 minimum and leading altogetherto additional expentiure of about  15 millions per annum for primary and secondary school teachers.   I also told them that the Governmentwas prepared to accept an increase in the total salary bill of this order,so long as this was spent in a way which avoided the difficulty on theminimum of the scale.3.        The Authorities decided nonetheless to proceed with their proposal and therefore made to the teachers on 2 8th May a final offer of a basic scale of  520 rising by increments of  27. 10s. to  1,900.This was rejected by the teachers and the Committee therefore reportedto me that a deadlock had been reached;  they have sought my views before this is publicly announced.4.        I have therefore said that I will go to the next meeting of the burnham Committee which has been arranged for 5th June. I shall need -(a) to declare my support for the Authorities in not going beyondthe total increased cost of  15 millions;(b) to make clear that the Government are unable tofollow the Authorities in approving a minimum of  520 for the basicscale and their reasons for the view that there should be no increase at this point above  510.5.

purpose of paragraph 4 of the annex.   I agree with it as a statementof general economic policy, but I think I should point out that the teacherscould claim on the basis of this paragraph that they should have a realincrease at the minimum of the scale broadly equivalent to the increasein productivity since October 1956.   This would mean a minimum ofabout  5 20.7.        The public presentation of our position may thereforebecome more difficult as time goes on, since we may in the end be forced away from the general economic argument to rest increasinglyon the educational reasons for discriminating against the minimum of the scale in favour of the maximum and improved differentials.Ministry of Education, W. 1.2nd June, 1959-2-CONFIDENTIAL
annex draft statement by the Minister of education to the Burnham CommitteeI was sorry to hear from your chairman after your last meeting that you had been unable to reach agreement on the basis upon which anew salary report could be framed.   On receiving this news I at oncetold him that if the Committee wished it, I was ready to take the unusualstep of coming myself to meet the Committee.   A similar course wasadopted in not entirely dissimilar circumstances by the present HomeSecretary, when he was Minister of Education.   His purpose was, asmine is now, to try to help the Commitee to reach an agreement byletting them know the sort of settlement which the Minister would beable to approve.2,        1 want to begin by emphasizing two things.   First, theGovernments concern that teachers&apos; salaries should correspond prop.erlywith the important services which they render to the community.   Theneed for this has become increasingly recognised in the post-war years.This need has, I think, found expression in each of the post-war Burnhamsettlements, but each time the apparent gain in salary has been eateninto by further rises in the cost of living.3.        This brings me to my second point.   It is more than everimportant for the nation as a whole and for the education service as anessential part of the national life that we should now avoid inflationaryincreases in personal incomes, particularly wages and salaries.Otherwise we hazard all that we have gained, both for the nation andfor the education service.   During the past year we have been able to achieve a sound balance of payments and reasonable stability in prices.This has been helped by an increasing moderation in wage settlements.As a result we now have within our grasp increasing opportunities for economic expansion - upon which the prospects for improvingstandards of life depend.   It is of immense importance - I cannotsufficiently emphasize the gravity of it to you - that nothing should nowbe done to endanger the prospects of continuing stability in prices andof the economic progress from which we have so much to hope.4.        The Government are in no sense denying the desirability of increases in the standard of living - indeed a steadily rising nationalstandard of living is on of their principal objectives - but increases in wages and salaries unrelated to the increase in national productivityare bound to lead to inflation from which the professional classes have in the past suffered as much as anyone.   While teaching is not aprofession whose contribution can be quantified in terms of productionand productivity, increases in teachers&apos; salaries must not be widelyout of scale with the increase in national productivity which is the broadgoverning factor in the national standard of living.5.        So far as teachers are concerned, we realise, as do the Authorities,that the time is ripe for some further advance in their salaries.   Butin considering what form this should take, we believe that a distinctionmust be drawn between salary increases designed to maintain real valuesand those which provide and are meant to provide a rise in real terms.-3-
CO N Fi DENTS AL6.        I understand that at the Committee&apos;s last meeting the Authorities&apos;Panel offered the Teachers&apos; Panel a new basic scale of  520 rising to  1,000 by annual increments of  27. 10s. together with improvements in the differential payments, and that these proposals, if they were agreed and approved, would add some  15 millions to the nation&apos;s salary billfor primary and secondary school teachers.   I can say straight awaythat T see no reason to question these proposals from the point ofview of their total cost.   Indeed, with one important reservation, Ican say that the general pattern of the Authorities1 offer would leadto proposals which I, as Minister, would be happy to approve, ifthey were submitted to me.   In saying this I have in mind how importantit is to meet the needs of teachers who have embarked upon theircareer and are incurring family responsibilities, as well as to provideproper rewards for teachers who are highly qualified or who holdpositions of responsibility in the schools.   This leads me to welcome the maximum of  1,000 at the top of the basic scale and the improvements in differential payments which have been proposed.7.        As the L oaal Authorities, no doubt with all these needs verymuch in mind, have made an offer which would  add  15 millions tothe salary bill, I am glad to repeat that I should as Minister be quite ready to endorse proposals that would have this result:  but I mustin fairness add that, so far as total cost is concerned,  I should not beable to go any further.   In that I entirely agree with them.8.        Now for my sole reservation about the Authorities&apos; offer.   Thisconcerns the increase proposed at the minimum of the sclae for new entrants to the profession.   In my view it is impossible to make anysufficient case for an increase at this point beyond a figure of  510representing an increase of just under l\ per cent over the minimum of  475 contained in the current -Report.    This adjustment would bringthe minimum in real terms to the same level as that established inOctober, 1956.   A minimum of  520 would, moreover, represent anincrease of about 9 \ per cent over the 1956 figure or, to put in another way, an increase of nearly 4j per cent on top   of the 5 per cent increasegranted earlier this year.   If I were to approve an increase of this order, there is a real danger that it would be taken to represent the government&apos;s view of what might be a reasonable increase over thewages field generally at this time.   This consideration applies particularly to the starting rate where direct comparison with industryand commerce is likely to be made.     For these reasons the Governmenthave felt bound to conclude that they could not sanction proposalswhich brought the minimum of the basic scale to more than  510.9.        I imagine that you may well wish to let what I have told youtoday be publicly known at the right moment.   If that is your wish, Ishould be&apos; happy to agree with you how this could best be done.   Inany case, my hope i s that you will find some way of working out proposals for submission to me which, in the light of what I have toldyou, I should be able to approve.June,1959-4-
