(59) 932nd June, 1959CABINETPROPOSED CHANGES IN NATIONAL assistance memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National InsuranceAs requested by the Ministerial Committee on Pensions I am submittingherewith, for the approval of the Cabinet, drafts of a short oral statement proposedto be made in Parliament and of a White Paper. I am indebted to the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster for help and advice on the draft of the former, and tomy colleagues on the Ministerial Committee for suggestions for the latter.2. The draft statement refers briefly to, and the White Paper sets out at length,a set of proposals which have been considered by the Ministerial Committee. the implementation of these proposals requires a Bill, Orders made under the Bill, and regulations requiring an affirmative resolution made on the initiative of theNational Assistance Board under existing powers. The main purpose of the white paper is to bring together into one document a comprehensive summary of whatis proposed.3.   It may be helpful if I summarise the proposals (a) It is proposed, subject to a formal proposal being made by the national assistance Board at its meeting on 10th June, to increase the scale ratesof national assistance from 45s. Od. to 50s. Od. a week for singlehouseholders and from 76s. Od. to 85s. Od. for married couples, with appropriate increases in the other rates.(b) The amounts of both capital and income which the National assistance board have to disregard in assessing means have remained unchangedsince 1948. It is proposed to take power to alter these disregards andto make increases in them of the order of 50 per cent.(c) It is proposed to deal with the problem which now arises where a recipientof national assistance has in his household an earning member of his family. At present the Board normally limit the amount allowedf or rentin such cases by reference to the level of rent which, in 1950, their localadvisory committee advised as being normal in the locality. In addition,they take into account an assumed contribution of 7s. Od. a week towardsthe general expenses of the household in respect of each earning member.It is proposed that the Board should now normally take account of thefull rent-as they do in other cases: and should substitute for the presentflat 7s. Od. assumed contribution the earner&apos;s proportionate share of thefull rent. This, would be presented as the final abolition of the oldassumed contribution to general household expenses and theintroduction of the principle that recipients of national assistance whoshare a household with earning members of their families should receivetheir share of the actual rent.4. Subject to approval by the Cabinet of the draft statement and White Paper,it is proposed to make the one and publish the other on 15th June.J. A.

DRAFT statement in the view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government and of the National assistance board the time has come to improve the standard of provision for the poorestmembers of the community so as to give them a share in the country&apos;s increasingprosperity.Since 1952 the Board, with whom, as the House knows, the initiative in proposing increases in the scale rates of national assistance has been placed by statute, has succeeded in co-operation with the Government of the day in maintaining the scales of assistance at levels somewhat better than those originallyfixed in 1948.  That is the position to-day. &apos; ; 1On the other hand, the various amounts of income and capital which theBoard are entitled to disregard in the assessment of need the so-called&quot;disregards&quot; are still at the level&apos;in &quot;&quot;cash terms at which they were fixed in 1948.The National Assistance Board have recommended and the Government have accepted a proposal to increase&apos;the scale of assistance for a single householderfrom the present level of 45s. Od. a week to 50s. Od. and for a married couple from76s. Od. tb&apos;85s. Od. a week, with appropriate increases in other rates;It is also proposed to make a substantial change in the arrangements where arecipient of national assistance has in his household an earning member of his family. At present the rent taken into account by the Board in these cases is normally that fixed some years ago on the advice of local advisory committees,in many cases less than the actual rent. There is also a contribution of 7s. Od.a week towards the general expenses of the household assumed to be made by theearning member. It is proposed in future normally to take account of the fullrent, to abandon the concept of an assumed contribution to general householdexpenses and instead to assess national assistance on the basis that the earningmember&apos;of the household and the recipient of assistance each contribute their ownshare of the total rent.It is proposed to make increases in the disregards of capital, other than warsavings, and of income of the order of 50 per cent. -The increases in national assistance will apply generally to recipients ofassistance, including those who draw it as a supplement to retirement pension orto unemployment or other national insurance benefits as weli as to those who relysolely on assistance, either for long or short periods.It is sometimes suggested that an application for national assistance can involve some loss of self respect. This is quite wrong.: Those who are in need are entitledas of fight to assistance, just as they and other citizens are entitled to other Statebenefits. I think that hon. Members on both sides of the House&apos;,&apos; and peopleoutside, will join me in expressing the hope that all those who are in need will make use of the State provision to which they are entitled. As has often been emphasised in this House, there can be Complete confidence that the National Assistance Boardand its officers administer this form of social service humanely and sympathetically.We are considering with the Board whether the terminology used in Order books and other documents can be improved so as&apos; to obviate &apos; any possibility ofmisunderstanding. &apos;&apos;   -&apos; &apos;-&apos; &apos;&quot;&quot;!&apos;Legislation will be needed to enable changes to be made in those disregardswhich are fixed by statute, and I am to-day giving&apos; notice; of presentation of thenecessary Bill. I have also to-day laid the&apos; necessary&apos; regulations to give effect tothe improvements in scale rates and other changes. A&apos;White Paper setting outthe proposals in full will be available at the Vote Office at 4 o&apos;clock this afternoon.These proposals will cost atbout  32 millions in a full year and, subject to theapproval of Parliament, it is proposed to bring them all into operation early inSeptember.June 1959.

DRAFT WHITE PAPER ON PROPOSED CHANGES IN NATIONALASSISTANCEINTRODUCTORY1. Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the National Assistance Board havebeen considering the position of those on National Assistance and have reachedthe conclusion that the time has come when it is right to move to a higher standard, so giving them a share in increasing national prosperity.2. Draft regulations have therefore been laid before Parliament which provide for increasing the scale rates of National Assistance and for certain other changes relating to the computation of requirements and resources for national Assistance purposes. A memorandum by the National assistance board explaining these Regulations is annexed. A Bill is also being presentedforthwith to empower the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance toincrease by Order the amounts of capital and certain forms of income whichthe Board are required by Statute to disregard in computing resources.THE MAIN CHANGESNational Assistance Scale Rates3. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have accepted proposals made by theNational Assistance Board, and draft Regulations (The Draft national assistance (Determination of Need) Regulations) have in accordance with section 6 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, been made in the form of thedraft submitted by the Board and laid for the approval of Parliament. these regulations propose to increase the scale rates of assistance for a singlehouseholder from the present 45s. to 50s. a week, and for a married couplefrom 76s. to 85s. a week, plus in each case an allowance for rent (includingrates), and with appropriate increases in other rates of assistance. The pro-posals are explained in detail in the annexed Memorandum by the national assistance Board.Rent and Assumed Contributions4. At present where the recipient of assistance is a householder whosehousehold includes an earning member the Board ordinarily make an allowance for rent limited by reference to what was advised in 1950 to bethe general level of rents in the locality. They also take into account anassumed contribution to general household expenses of 7s. a week in respectof an earning member. It is proposed under the new Regulations to abolish the present flat-rate 7s. contribution to general household expenses, andnormally to allow for the full rent; in future recipients of National Assistancesharing their household with earning members will normally receive theirproportionate share of the actual rent, while earning members of the house-hold will be assumed to contribute their proportionate share of the rent andnothing else.
Capital and Income Disregards,OTlie proposed Bill will give the Minister of Pensions and Nationalance power, by Order, to increase the amounts of capital (other than warsavings) and income at present specified in the Second Schedule to the national assistance Act, 1948. Any Order so made will be subject to the approval by affirmative resolution of each House of Parliament, except in the case of anOrder made within a month of the passing of the Bill, which will be subject tonegative resolution only. This exception is to enable the changes which theGovernment propose in the capital and income disregards to become effectiveat the same time as the changes in the scale rates of Assistance.6. If Parliament approves these proposals, the Government intend toincrease the amount of capital assets (other than war savings) which theNational Assistance Board are required completely to disregard from  50 to 100, and to raise the limit above which assistance may not be paid from  400to  600. The Government also intend to increase amounts which theSchedule requires the Board to disregard out of certain specified forms of income to 15s. a week where 10s. 6d. a week is at present prescribed (forexample, for occupational pension, or Friendly Society or Trades Union sickpay), and to 30s. a week where 20s. is now prescribed (for example, for awar disability or industrial injuries disablement pension).7. Any Order made under the power which is being sought to increase theamounts of resources disregarded under the National Assistance Act will also make corresponding increases for the purpose of the disregards to be applied in deciding applications for legal aid, in so far as these are governed by theNational Assistance Act.Other Matters8. The draft Regulations submitted by the National Assistance Boardalso provide for increases in the amount to be disregarded out of earnings.COST9. It is estimated that the cost in a full year of the proposed increases in the scale rates of National Assistance will be about  27 million; that the changes which the Government propose to make in the amounts of disregardedresources, under the powers which would be given by the Bill, will cost about 2 million in a full year; and that the other changes proposed in the draft regulations in relation to earnings and rent will cost about  3 million in afull year. The total cost, in a full year, will, therefore, be of the order of 32 million.DATE OF OPERATION10. It is intended that all the new provisions should, subject to theapproval of Parliament, come into operation on September 7, 1959.
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUMBy the National Assistance Board on the Draft National Assistance(Determination of Need) Regulations, 19591. These Regulations replace with amendments the Regulations underwhich the officers of the National Assistance Board determine whether aperson is in need of an allowance under Part II of the National AssistanceAct, 1948, and, if so, how much should be granted. They have been madeby the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance in the terms of a draftsubmitted by the Board and require the approval of each House of parliament before they can become operative. Subject to such approval, regulations will be made in the terms of the draft to come into operation on 7th September,1959.2. The regulations will replace the regulations of 1957(1) which, byamendment of the regulations of 1948,(2) prescribe the current scale rates which came into force on 27th January, 1958. They will also replace theother provisions of the 1948 regulations, including the amendment made bythe regulations of 1952(3) regarding assistance to persons maintained inaccommodation provided under Part III of the National Assistance. Act, 1948.The new regulations will thus deal with all the matters which require to bedealt with in regulations made under Section 6 of the Act.3. The major changes proposed are those in the scales, that is, in the sums prescribed by the Regulations for requirements other than rent and rates, which are allowed for separately. The scales, which came intooperation in 1948, have since then been increased six times and more thanfully maintain the value of the original scales of 1948. The Board havenow, however, thought it right to propose some raising of standards. the scales at present in force and those now proposed are as follows:  Ordinary Scale: (a) For a husband and wife     ............(6) For a person who is living alone, or is a householderand, as such, is directly responsible for rent and household necessaries...............(c) For any other person, being (i) aged 21 years or over............(ii) aged 18 years or over but less than 21 years ...(iii) aged 16 years or over but less than 18 years ...(iv) aged 11 years or over but less than 16 years ...(v) aged 5 years or over but less than 11 years ...(vi) aged under 5 years     ............Present		new rates		ratess.	d.	s.    d.76	0	85    045	0	50    041	0	46    031	6	36    026	0	30    020	0	23    017	0	19    014	6	16    0C1) The National Assistance (Determination of Need) Amendment Regulations, 1957(S i 1957/2072).&quot; (2) The National Assistance (Determination of Need) Regulations, 1948 (S.I. 1948/1334).(3) The National Assistance (Determination of Need) Amendment Regulations, 1952(S.I. 1952/873).
The rates in a special scale applicable to blind persons and persons whoha$i%ifFered a loss of income in order to undergo treatment for tuberculosisof tire respiratory system, will also be increased as follows:  	Present		New	rates		ratesSpecial Scale: 	s.	d.	s.   d.(a) For a husband and wife 			(i) of whom one is such a person......	96	0	107    6(ii) of whom both are such persons     ......	110	0	122    6(b) For any other such person, being 			(i) aged 21 years or over............	65	0	72    6(ii) aged 18 years or over but less than 21 years ...	48	6	55    0(iii) aged 16 years or over but less than 18 years ...	40	0	45    04. The effect of the proposals regarding scale rates is to increase theordinary scale rate for a married couple by 9s. and for a single adult by 5s.The increases for other persons including dependent children vary accordingto age. For example, under the ordinary scale a married couple with threechildren aged 12, 8 and 3 years paying a rent of 15s. a week could at presentexpect to have their income, including family allowances, made up to at least 7 2s. 6d. a week. Under the Regulations now put forward they could expect to have their income made up to at least  7 18s. Od., an increase of 15s. 6d.The corresponding figure under the Regulations of 1948 would have been 4 2s. a week.5. The special scale for blind and for certain tuberculous persons is being increased by rather more than the ordinary scale: in the special scale rates which apply most often the excess over the corresponding rates in the ordinaryscale, now 20s., will become 22s. 6d. For example, the requirements of ablind man with a sighted wife paying a rent of 15s. a week will be assessedat  6 2s. 6d. a week, compared with  5 if both partners were sighted.6. Assistance has sometimes to be fixed by reference to considerations which make the scale rates inapplicable or inappropriate and when this is so the applicant^ income may be increased by less than the normal amount;thus in the case of persons paying an inclusive charge for boarding and lodgingdiscretion has to be exercised to grant assistance at a rate which leaves areasonable amount for other expenses after meeting the inclusive charge.7. Apart from the changes in the scales and with two other exceptionsmentioned below, the draft Regulations reproduce in substance the provisionsof the 1948 Regulations (including the amendment referred to in paragraph 2)and of Part 1 of the Schedule to those Regulations which prescribes rules forthe computation of requirements, including the allowances to be made forrent.   The exceptions are as follows :  (1) in connection with the change referred to in paragraph 8 (2), the reference to &quot; the general level of rents in the locality &quot; in the paragraphabout rent allowances in Part 1 of the Schedule is omitted, and(2) the maximum amount which may be paid under that paragraph byway of rent allowance to a person living as a member of someone else&apos;shousehold is raised from 10s. to 15s.
As a matter of form, the effect of Section 5 (4) of the National AssistanceAct, which requires the Regulations to provide for the rules as to difT^rardlaid down in the second Schedule to the Act to be followed in compusffi^ theresources of an applicant, is now achieved by a provision (Regulation 2) inthe body of the Regulations.8. As a result of the change in Regulation 2 mentioned above, thestatutory disregards are not repeated in Part II of the Schedule to theRegulations, which contains rules for computing resources not laid down indetail in the Act. The remaining provisions of Part II differ from thecorresponding provisions of the 1948 Regulations in the following respects:  (1) Changes are made in the provisions relating to the treatment of earnings by a person receiving assistance, or by a dependant of sucha person. A minimum of 30s. a week together with half of the next20s. of any earnings above that amount is substituted for the sumof 20s. which may at present be disregarded out of the earnings of old people and others not required to register for employment; the sumof 15s. a week is substituted for the 10s. which may at present be disregarded in the case of a person required to register for employment;and the sum of 15s. is substituted for the proportion of one-third of the earnings of a dependant aged under 16, which will have the effect ofincreasing the amount to be disregarded out of any earnings by adependent child before they are taken into account against the allowance made for him.(2) Contributions to household expenses are assumed to be made bynon-dependent members of the household of a person (other thana blind person or the husband or wife of a blind person) receivingassistance. At present a sum of 7s. (with abatements for membersearning small amounts) is taken into account whatever the rent paidby the householder. This provision is replaced by a provision for anassumed contribution not exceeding a proportionate share of the rent.The allowance made for rent in such cases will then ordinarily be the full amount of the net rent paid by the householder and the fixing of a &quot; reasonablerent&quot; by reference to the general level of rents in the locality will no longer be necessary.9. The discretionary powers which form an important part of theRegulations will continue to be exercised in any case where specialcircumstances so require. In the exercise of their general discretionarypowers the Board propose, having regard to the increases proposed by theGovernment in the amounts which the Second Schedule to the national assistance Act requires to be disregarded from certain forms of income, toincrease correspondingly from 10s. 6d. a week to 15s. the amount ordinarilydisregarded from certain other forms of income including voluntary allowancesfrom friends or relatives and payments from charities or benevolentassociations.National Assistance Board,June, 1959.55279  Wt.       /       K    6/59 f.o.p.
