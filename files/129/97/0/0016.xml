secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1959C (59) 66 Copy No.     5 710th April, 1959CABINETJOHN waters memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland the Waters Tribunal have now reported to me and a copy of their report isattached.2. The Tribunal^ remit was in two sections: the allegation of assault uponJohn Waters; and the actions in connexion therewith of the Caithness police.3. With regard to the first part of their remit, the Tribunal are of opinionthat there is no evidence which could convict the two constables in a criminalcourt (paragraph 16). But they find that Constable Gunn, being &quot; sorely tried bythe provocative behaviour and language &quot; of the boy (paragraph 15), hit him a blow(paragraph 13) which they accept from the doctor was moderate (paragraph 14).They say that what he did was for a policeman unquestionably wrong, and thatthey must unquestionably condemn it. They also express disapproval of the factthat the two constables left the boy in the alley next to Peterkin&apos;s shop unattendedafter he had received an injury (paragraph 15). In addition the Tribunal makethe following criticisms of the constables (i) They describe a threatening remark made by Constable Harper to one ofthe boys in the Bay Cafe as highly improper, though they attribute nosinister significance to it (paragraph 9).(ii) They say that the taking of John Waters into the lane opposite the BayCafe and into the alley next to Peterkin&apos;s shop were errors of judgment,although they indicate that these were not serious (paragraphs 9 and 15).(iii) They say that it was wrong for Constable Harper to have attempted toget the complaint withdrawn for a money payment (paragraph 17).4. With regard to the second part of their remit, the Tribunal find the action taken by the Caithness police to have been all that it should have been(paragraph 22).5.   The following aspects of the matter seem to require consideration (a) Publication of Report and EvidenceI propose that the report and evidence should be published onWednesday, 15th April. It would not be in accordance with precedentto make any Government statement on the day of publication, and one possibility might be simply to announce in reply to a written question on the previous day that the report and the evidence would bepublished next day, leaving any statement of the Governments attitude to be made either in reply to a later Question or in the course of anydebate on the report. In view, however, of the nature of the findingsand the desirability of making clear with whom the responsibility forany further action lies, on balance it seems a short statement should bemade on the day of publication and I append a draft of what I should propose to say (Annex A). I assume that a corresponding statement should be made in the House of Lords.55003B
(b) Form of any DebateThere may be pressure for a debate both on the report and possibly on the general question of proceedings under the Tribunals of Inquiry(Evidence) Act, 1921. Since any debate would be bound to range over the merits of the case, it may be desirable that it should not take place untilthe Chief Constable has had an opportunity of considering what action,if any, he should take.The question will arise whether some disciplinary action should betaken against both constables in the light of the findings of the Tribunal.Disciplinary proceedings could be taken only under the Police(Discipline) (Scotland) Regulations, which provide that the bringing ofany disciplinary charge is decided on by the Deputy Chief Constableand the case is then heard by the Chief Constable, who is the disciplinaryauthority. It is thus for the Chief Constable to decide whether the charge is proved and to fix the punishment. I cannot forecast whether it will bedecided to take disciplinary action or, if action is taken, how the charges would be framed; and, in view of my position as appellate authority, itseems to me that I could not properly intervene in these matters.Although some people may expect disciplinary action to be taken, therewill undoubtedly be a strong body of opinion to the effect that theconstables have already suffered enough. It may be that the disciplinaryauthority will take the view that no proceedings should be taken becausethe findings of the Tribunal were, at least in part, based on evidence givenby the constables on an assurance by the Lord Advocate that he wouldnot institute criminal proceedings against them in respect of their conduct in relation to the matters under investigation; and that,although legally this assurance was confined to criminal proceedings,morally it might be regarded as applicable also to disciplinary action.Moreover, if disciplinary proceedings are taken, I am advised by theScottish Law Officers that it would be impossible for the disciplinaryauthority to proceed on the basis that the findings of the Tribunalshowed that the constables were guilty of discreditable conduct; andthey consider that it would therefore be necessary to traverse again,at any rate in part, the ground covered by the Tribunal. The position isfurther complicated by the fact that advice was given in DepartmentalCirculars in 1943 and 1955 to the effect that, where it has been decided by the Crown authorities that there is insufficient evidence to justify theinstitution of criminal proceedings for an alleged criminal offence, the disciplinary authority will have no option hut to decide that no charge should be brought under the disciplinary code in respect of that offence.The relevant passages are attached at Annex B. This advice might bethought to preclude disciplinary action at least so far as the blow isconcerned, but if I were asked, as I may well be, whether I regarded it asprecluding a disciplinary charge against Constable Gunn, I should feel bound to say that strictly I did not. On the other hand, I should feelinclined to point out to him that Constable Gunn in giving evidence tothe Tribunal may well have assumed that in view of the Circulars there could be no question of disciplinary action against him in respect of the striking of the blow. The statement which I propose to make merelysays that it will be for the Chief Constable, as the disciplinary authorityfor the men of his force, to consider the conclusions reached by theTribunal under the first part of their remit. I do not think I can sayless than this, but in view of the considerations set out earlier in thisparagraph I should not propose to give the Chief Constable anyguidance on whether or not disciplinary proceedings should be initiated,although I should if asked be prepared to advise on the application ofthe Circulars.6. I should be glad to know whether my colleagues agree to the publicationof the report and evidence on Wednesday, 15th April and to the terms of thestatement which I propose to make.u any, ne s* *s  (c) Future ActionJ.

Annex AWATERS TRIBUNALDraft Statement for the Secretary of State to make after Question time, On 18th February, 1959, in pursuance of resolutions passed by bothHouses of Parliament I appointed a Tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry(Evidence) Act, 1921, to inquire into a definite matter of urgent public importance,namely, the allegation that John Waters was assaulted on 7th December, 1957,at Thurso and the action taken by the Caithness police in connexion therewith.I have now received the report of the Tribunal and the House will, I am sure, wishto join me in thanking Lord Sorn and his colleagues, Sir James Robertson andMr. Dandie, for the thorough and prompt way in which they have carried out their task. Copies of the report and of the evidence given before the Tribunal areavailable in the Vote Office.2. As to the first part of the remit, the Tribunal are of opinion that there isnot sufficient evidence on which the two constables concerned could be convictedin a criminal court. But they find that one of the two constables struck the boyWaters a blow of moderate severity. They go on to say that no doubt the constablewas sorely tried by the boy&apos;s provocative behaviour and language but that what theconstable did was for a policeman undoubtedly wrong. They also draw attentionto one or two respects in which the conduct of the two constables, though notconstituting a criminal offence, was open to criticism. It will be for- the chief constable, who is by law the disciplinary authority for the men of his force, toconsider the conclusions reached by the Tribunal under this part of their remit.3. As regards the second part of the remit, the Tribunal find that the action taken by the Caithness police was all that it should have been.55003

All criminal offences by a police officer against the person or property ofa person outside the Police Service, and any other criminal offence by a policeofficer which appears to the Chief Constable to be too serious to be dealt with bydisciplinary proceedings instead of by criminal proceedings, should be reportedto the Procurator Fiscal of the Sheriff Court.* * * * * *4. If the Procurator Fiscal decides that criminal proceedings are not to be instituted because of the lack of sufficient evidence, the alleged criminal offenceshould not be made the basis of a charge of breach of the Discipline Code.5.

In such cases the charges inrespect of breaches of the Discipline Code should be formulated and notified tothe man but in general no steps should be taken to proceed with the charges untileither the Procurator Fiscal has intimated that there are to be no proceedings onthe criminal charge, or the result of the criminal proceedings is known. . . .Extract from Scottish Home Department Circular No. 8550of the 8th March, 1955. . . .

JPpp CEEDING&amp; OF THE TRIBUNAL APPOINTED TO% INQUIRE INTO THE ALLEGATION OF assault on JOHN waters to : The Right Honourable John S. Maclay,Secretary of State for Scotland.1. We were appointed by you on 18th February, 1959 to be a tribunal:under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921 for the purpose ofinquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance, that is to say, the allegation that John Waters was assaulted on the 7th December, 1957 atThurso and the action taken by the Caithness police in connection therewith.2. Our first step was to invite the Dean of Faculty, Mr. C. J. D. Shaw,Q.C., Mr. D. Y. Abbey, Advocate, and Mr. D. C. McConnachie, W.S. to act ascounsel and solicitor to the tribunal. The invitation was accepted and weappointed these gentlemen to act in that capacity. Our instructions to them were to make a full and independent investigation into the matters coveredby our terms of reference ; to recover all relevant documents and to presentthe evidence to us at our public sitting by examining the witnesses and, ifnecessary, by cross-examining them also.3. We held our public inquiry in Inverness on the 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th,21st and 23rd March, 1959, and heard evidence on oath from 38 witnesses.In addition to counsel for the tribunal there were the following appearances:on behalf of John Waters and his father Mr. J. D. Waters, Mr. J. O. M.Hunter, Q.C., and Mr. R. A Bennett; on behalf of Constable Harper andConstable Gunn (the two constables involved in the allegation) Mr. M. Kissen,Q.C., and Mr. E. G. F. Stewart; and on behalf of the Chief Constable andthe Caithness Constabulary Mr. H. R. Leslie, Q.C. and Mr. J. S. Mowat. Allthe witnesses were called1 to the witness box by counsel for the tribunal whoexamined and, where necessary, cross-examined them. Thereafter they werequestioned by the other counsel in whatever seemed to us to be the fairestorder, regard being had to the nature of the evidence given. When the twoconstables involved in the allegation were called to the witness box they wereeach told by the tribunal that they were not compelled to answer questions ifthe answers would incriminate them. To each of them the Dean of Facultyintimated that he was authorised by the Lord Advocate to state that the lord advocate would not institute criminal proceedings against the witness inrespect of his conduct in relation to the matters under investigation. Theprocedure adopted proved satisfactory and we believe that we have heardall there is to hear about the subject matter of our inquiry.4. Our terms of referenoe cover two matters which can be treatedseparately. First there is the allegation that John Waters was assaulted on 7th December, 1957, and the question of what happened on that occasion.Then there is the question of what action the Caithness police took inconnection therewith and the question whether that action was, or was not, allthat it should have been. We propose to deal with each of these mattersseparately and in the above order.331875 A 2
5. We should begin with a short description of the locus. The Bay GS \in which the story begins, is situated in Swanson Street. The High SW.iof Thurso runs north and south and Swanson Street runs into it from the west.The distance from the Bay Cafe to the High Street is some ten or fifteenyards. If you go from Swanson Street into High Street and turn right (south-wards) and follow the west side pavement you come after about a hundredyards to Peterkin&apos;s Chemist shop. At this point there is a break in theregularity of the shop frontages and the next shop (Allan&apos;s Toy shop) is setback some fifteen feet further from the carriageway. Moreover, Allan&apos;s shopdoes not adjoin Peterkin&apos;s, there being a narrow passage two feet nine inchesin width between the two buildings. After a distance of ten feet this passagewidens slightly to a width of four feet four inches and after a further distance of some fourteen feet it opens into a courtyard on the other side of which isthe door of a house occupied by Mr. and Mrs. MacPhee. The passage is themeans of access to this house and it is unlit. It was into this passage or alleythat the two named constables ultimately took John Waters.6. The story begins with the entry of Constables Harper and Gunn into the bay Cafe at about 10.30 p.m. on Saturday 7th December, 1957. This theydid in the ordinary course of their duty. We were told that when construc-tion began on the Dounreay atomic power station near Thurso some years agothere was an influx of population which led to an increase in rowdiness anddrunkenness in the town, and the statistics of convictions fully bear this out.Provost Sinclair drew the attention of the police to this state of affairs whilepresiding over the Licensing Court in 1956 and requested them to exercisesupervision over licensed premises and cafes. The police acted upon this request and it became a standing instruction for constables on the beat to visitsuch premises from time to time. In the case of the Bay Cafe, in whichrowdiness was not unknown, one of the partners in the business had addedhis own request for police supervision and visits by the constables on the beatwere a regular thing, particularly on Saturday nights.7. Among others present in the Bay Cafe on the occasion in question there was a group of six boys which included John Waters. The boys agesranged from fourteen to eighteen and John Waters himself was fifteen yearsof age. Before describing the events which took place it will be convenient todeal here with a matter which runs through the whole incident, namely, thekind of language used by John Waters. The evidence of the two constables isto the effect that throughout the whole incident Waters used obscene indeedvery obscene language. This is denied by Waters and, so far as the eventstqok place in the Bay Cafe, by those of the other boys in the grbup who were called as witnesses. Three of them gave evidence and they did not makea favourable impression on us as regards reliability. In cross-examinationtheir denial of the use of bad language by Waters tended to take the form ofa statement that he might have used bad language but that they did not hearit. Then it came out in cross-examination that, after the TribunaFs solicitorhad precognosced the boys, they had a meeting together at which one of the subjects discussed was the question of what they were to say if they were askedabout Waters using obscene language. The significance of this is obvious.If this matter depended solely on the credibility of the two constables on theone hand and the boys on the other we should prefer the evidence of the twoconstables for, although, as will later be seen, we reject some of the evidence
jfp). by the constables with regard to the concluding phase of the incident,we^formed the impression that the evidence given by them up to that point was in substance truthful and accurate. But the question of language does notrest solely upon this estimate of relative credibility because we have theevidence of the two proprietors of the Cafe, Mr. Cardosi and Mr. Craig. Mr.CardosFs attitude was that he did not hear what passed between the police-men and the boys. He was an unsatisfactory witness and his demeanourand hesitation in the witness box left us with the impression that be could havetold us more than he did. Having committed himself to the statement thathe had never heard Waters use bad language he had later to admit that aweek before the sitting of the Tribunal he had made a contrary statement andhad mentioned a specific instanoe of Waters making an obscene and offensiveremark. Mr. Craig, on the other hand, heard what passed between the twoconstables and the boys and his evidence, which we regard as reliable, fullycorroborates what the constables say as to the language used by Waters. Wehave no doubt that both in the Cafe and in the succeeding stages of the incident the language used by Waters to the constables was obscene andoffensive.8. When Constables Harper and Gunn entered the Cafe one of the boys,probably Leslie Ross, made the remark &quot; Here&apos;s our friends &quot; with the addi-tion, perhaps, of the phrase &quot; two smart guys &quot;. The remark at all events wasuttered sarcastically and was greeted with laughter from the group of boys.The constables heard the remark, as they were no doubt intended to do, andConstable Harper addressing himself to the boy Ross said &quot; If there&apos;s anymore cheek, 1*11 mark you for life &quot;. At this Waters uttered a derisive ejacula-tion or grunt and, turning to him, Constable Harper asked for his name.Waters remained silent and, upon again being asked for his name, made anobscene and offensive remark. Constable Harper then asked Waters to comeoutside and, when the boy did not move to comply, took him by the arm andled him out of the Cafe. The other boys followed to the door to see what happened. Once outside the Cafe the constables took Waters across the roadinto a dark lane leading to the back of some premises opposite the Cafeand Constable Harper again asked the boy for his name which this time he gave. Constable Harper then warned him not to be cheeky and told him thathe should not be using language such as he had used. Waters then returnedtowards the Cafe and the two constables moved off towards High Street. Asthe boy approached the Cafe door he called out to the constables &quot;Youbaggrars think you can do anything because you have a blue uniform &quot; orwords to that effect. At this Constable Harper remarked to Constable Gunn&quot; Never heed it&quot; and the two constables resumed their patrol. So far asthey were concerned the incident was closed.9. Before going on with the second chapter of the story we pause to make certain observations. The remark which Constable Harper made to the boyRoss was a highly improper remark and, in view of what is to follow, our first impression was that there might well be something sinister in it. At theend of the day, however, we are satisfied that this is not so. The remarkwas made simply for effect in an attempt to quell the boys. Moreover theevidence of the boys themselves makes it plain that they did not take theremark seriously.   Then there is the taking of the boy off the street into a
dark lane. The view held by Constables Harper and Gunn is that if afiBjis to be spoken to it is desirable, if possible, to take him off the street and out of sight of others. The more senior officers who appeared before us were inclined to take a different view. We would think that the propriety or other-wise of taking a boy aside must depend on the particular circumstances ofthe situation and, in the present case, if the constables made any error injudgment in taking the boy into the lane we do not think it was a serious one.10. After Waters had returned to the Cafe one of the other boys drewhis attention to the fact that the stitching of the outside seam of the leftsleeve of his jacket was torn near the shoulder for a length of two and a halfinches. This may or may not have been due to Constable Harper holding hisarm as there is no suggestion that force was used.  It was no great matterbut it excited Waters.  As we read the situation, he had lost face by beingled out of the Cafe and he saw in this an opportunity to turn the tables againstthe constables.  He exclaimed (according to the witness Mr. Craig) &quot;I mustget after them bsaptrs&quot; and ran out of the Cafe.   Three of the other boysfollowed him and went as far as the junction of Swanson Street and HighStreet. The constables by this time, having entered High Street from SwansonStreet and turned southwards along the west pavement, had reached a points little way short of Peterkin&apos;s shop and it was there that Waters, still running,overtook them.  For what ensued from this point until the taking of- the boyinto the alley we depend substantially upon the evidence of the two constablesand the boy himself.  The accounts given on either side have a good deal in common but we are satisfied that the account given by the boy minimisesthe part he himself played.   The probabilities are against the boy&apos;s storybeing a complete account because, taken by itself, it would make the actingsof the constables inexplicable.   The constables say that when the boy over-took them he thrust himself between them and said &quot; You battraris tore myjacket&quot; and we believe this.  Constable Harper replied to this by saying hedidn&apos;t think he had done so but, if he had, he was sorry.  There is no doubtahout this being the reply that Constable Harper made, since Waters himselfso says.  Constable Harper then added, with reference to the boy&apos;s presentbehaviour, that if he didn&apos;t behave he would lock him up for a breach of thepeace.   This remark, which Waters himself states as having been made inthe statement he gave to Inspector Carter immediately after the incident, hadno effect and the boy said &quot; You think you&apos;re a smart faator &quot;.  By this timethe constables were on the move again and Constable Gunn intervened once and possibly twice to tell the boy to go away and leave them and to say thathe would be in serious trouble if he did not.   In spite of this the boy stillcame on and made an obscene and offensive reply.   Constable Gunn then decided that things had gone too far and took the boy by the arm. ConstableHarper evidently assented to this and took the other arm.  By this time theywere at or about Peterkin&apos;s shop and when they reached the alley immediatelybeyond it Harper told Gunn who was on the inside of the pavement to takehim in there.   The alley being so narrow as to make single file necessaryGunn let the boy go first and then followed himself.   Constable Harperbrought up the rear. At this point in the story the question naturally arises : what was in the minds of the two constables when they took the boy into thealley?   This is an important question and we will return to it; but in themeantime we will continue the narrative.
(11^1. As regards what happened in the alley we think it best to begin byreTiemng to the account given by each of the three persons concerned. the account given by Waters is that he had only gone a few steps up the alleywhen he received a blow in the face. He did not see which of the two police-men hit him but he heard Constable Harper say &quot; You shouldn&apos;t have donethat, boy&quot;, a remark which he understood as being addressed to Gunn.He states that he then tried to run back down the alley but was stopped byConstable Harper who placed a packing case in the courtyard and said&quot;Sit down, you will be O.K. soon&quot;. Shortly thereafter he says thatMrs. MacPhee came to her door and took him into the house. Our onlycomment at the moment is that this account, like the rest of Waters&apos; evidence,is somewhat compressed and leaves out the part which he himself played.Constable Harper says that after he had done a few steps up the alley he heardConstable Gunn tell Waters that he was going to book him and heard himask for his father&apos;s name and other particulars. He also heard the boy makeoffensive replies including the use of the phrase &quot; Gestapo bastards &quot;. he says that he then heard a commotion and put on his torch by the light ofwhich he saw the boy with his hands over his face moving towards the court-yard. He agrees that he make the remark &quot;You shouldn&apos;t have done that,boy &quot; but says that it was addressed not to Constable Gunn but to Waters.He then followed the boy and made him sit on the packing case as already described. Constable Gunn&apos;s account is that he told Waters he was going tobook him and asked for particulars. He says that Waters made offensivereplies, which he quotes, and used the phrase &quot;Gestapo bartards&quot;. He says that he had his left hand on Waters&apos; right shoulder and that, at this point.Waters struggled and made a rush to get past him and out of the alley. He says that, in order to stop the boy, he thrust his right hand out to the wall andthe boy&apos;s face came in contact with it either as it was moving towards the wall.or after it had got there. In cross-examination he said that it was hiswrist with which the boy&apos;s face came into contact. He confirms that Harpermade the boy sit down as described. Both Constables say that after theboy had been seated he was formally cautioned and charged by ConstableGunn first with using obscene language and, secondly, with molesting thepolice. They also said that Constable Harper offered the boy his handker-chief and that the boy refused assistance and abusively called on them to goaway, which they then did.12. We shall briefly conclude the narrative of events and then return tothe question of what really happened in the alley. Mrs. MacPhee&apos;s attentionhad been attracted by the sound of raised voices in the alley and she called to her husband who was in bed. He rose to see what the disturbance wasabout but by the time he and Mrs. MacPhee opened their door there wasno one but the boy in the courtyard. When he saw that the boy was injuredMr. MacPhee&apos;s somewhat surprising reaction was that he himself might getblamed for it and so, to keep himself right, he went at once to report thematter at the police station. Mrs. MacPhee found the boy with a bleedingnose and took him to the kitchen sink where she washed him. He said toher that he had been hit by two policemen. By this time there was quite alittle crowd of young people at the entrance to the alley, consisting of somewho had seen the constables taking Waters in and of some others who hadgathered. The crowd included a number of Waters&apos; relations and one of these,
Andrew Manson, went into Mrs. MacPhee&apos;s house and accompanied ^S^jfsfrom there to the house of his aunt Mrs. Campbell. Mrs. Campbell sayPliiatWaters was crying and trembling and that he was still bleeding. She helped to wash him up and on her advice he went to call on Dr. Fell the family doctor. To both Andrew Manson and Mrs. Campbell Waters stated that hehad been hit by a policeman and to Mrs. Campbell he said that it wasConstable Gunn who hit him because Constable Harper had remarked &quot; Youshouldn&apos;t have done that.&quot;. While Waters was with Dr. Fell he was joined by his father who had received word of the incident. On leaving the doctorMr. Waters and his son went to the police station and lodged a complaint of assault against Constables Harper and Gunn with Inspector Carter. Asregards the movements of the two constables after leaving the alley, theycompleted their patrol and returned to the police station. Later that nightConstable Gunn made some notes in his notebook as to a charge againstWaters in respect of using obscene language and molesting the police andthese notes together with statements obtained from Mr. Craig and Mr. Cardosiwere later embodied in a formal report handed in on Tuesday 10th December,1957.13. To return now to the alley. We are prepared to believe that afterentering the alley Constable Gunn told Waters that he was going to bookhim and that he asked for particulars ; we are prepared also to believe thatthe boy was still unsubdued and that he gave truculent and obscene replies;but we cannot accept Constable Gunn&apos;s account of the way in which theboy sustained his injuries. Our opinion is that Constable Gunn becameexasperated by the boy&apos;s behaviour, and perhaps by a struggle on thepart of the boy to get away, and that he struck him an impulsive blow.The account given by the boy is clear and is to the effect that it was ablow he received and this account was repeated de recenti to several witnesses.As already indicated, we are far from regarding Waters as a wholly reliablewitness but on this point we believe he was telling the truth. The natureof the injury is consistent with a blow and in the circumstances as we know them it is, to say the least of it, highly improbable that it could havebeen caused by the boy colliding with a fist or arm. Then there is theremark &quot; You should not have done that, boy &quot; made by Constable Harperto Constable Gunn. This remark conveys that Constable Harper understoodthat Constable Gunn had hit the boy and that is what it must have conveyed to Constable Gunn. To this remark Constable Gunn made no demur. Onbehalf of the constables it was suggested that the remark was addressednot to Constable Gunn but to Waters and that the use of the word &quot; boy &quot;indicated this. We cannot, however, entertain the suggestion. In Caithnessthe use of the word &quot; boy &quot; as a form of address between one adult andanother is not uncommon and, moreover, in the story as told by ConstableHarper himself there was no occasion for him to have made a remark like this to the boy at the moment when it was uttered. We should add thatConstable Harper&apos;s credibility is shaken by the fact that at least on one occasion, to which we will refer later, he gave an account of what tookplace in the alley differing from the account given by him in the witness box.We therefore find it proved that Constable Gunn hit the boy. We are confirmed in this conclusion by the subsequent actings of Constable Harper,later referred to, which are not consistent with there being nothing to hide.
Xy/^hould add, with reference to what happened after the boy received hisitfjlry, that we are disinclined to believe that the boy was formally cautionedand charged whilst sitting on the packing case.14. As regards the injury to the boy we had the evidence of Dr. Fellwho examined him within a short time of the event. By this time the boy&apos;snose had stopped bleeding and the only injury he found was that the upperlip was slightly swollen on the right side and that there was a correspondingabrasion on the inside of the lip. There was an area of tenderness on theright cheek. The boy was distressed and shaking when the doctor saw him.No treatment was required or given. On the following Tuesday (10thDecember) the boy called on Dr. Fell complaining of nervousness and sickness and the doctor prescribed a mild sedative. He called again on 14th Decemberwith a more or less similar complaint and was similarly treated. The boywas kept from school for a week but not upon the doctor&apos;s advice. We,have thought it right to rehearse this medical evidence in detail but in doing so we do not intend to convey that the injury was in any way aserious one. There was, we think, a tendency to make the most of the injury and Dr. Fell himself was surprised at the boy coming back twice tosee him. The blow made his nose bleed and caused a slight abrasion tothe inside of his upper lip and that is all there was to it. We do notcriticise Mrs. Campbell for sending him to Dr. Fell but it was not the kindof injury for which the ordinary parent or schoolmaster would have thought of calling in a doctor at all. As regards the way in which the blow was delivered we cannot be certain. There was only one blow and it may havebeen delivered with the fist or, having regard to the area of tenderness, itmay more probably have been a cuff delivered with the open hand. Asregards the force behind the blow we adopt the view expressed by Dr. FellWho described it as moderate.15. We should now offer our appreciation of the actions of the twoconstables and the boy Waters. As regards Waters, we have heard a gooddeal about him in connection with this incident and otherwise. We donot think he is in any way a bad or vicious boy and he gets a good wordfrom his teachers and from an officer of the Boys Brigade for his behaviourin school and while with the Brigade. On the other hand there is no doubtthat he is an extremely cheeky boy and, on the occasion in question, hisbehaviour and language can only be described as shocking. As regardsConstable Gunn, who was twenty-two years old at the time, there is no doubtthat he was sorely tried by the provocative behaviour and language of thisexcited boy, and we can understand how it came about that he yielded to the temptation of striking him. But that is as far as we can go. What he did was,for a policeman, unquestionably wrong and we must unquestionably condemnit. As regards Constable Harper, he only becomes implicated if he is tobe regarded as acting in concert with Constable Gunn at the time whenthe blow was struck and to that question we should now address ourselves.In the circumstances of the present case that question really resolves itselfinto this question: when the constables took the boy into the alley, was there a common purpose to inflict chastisement of one kind or anotherupon him? If all that one knew about the case was that the two constableshad taken the boy into an alley and that, after they had left, the boy was found there suffering from the effects of a blow it might be natural to draw
the inference that they had acted in concert. But that is not the Tonwe are in. Having heard the evidence and seen the witnesses we do&quot; &apos;notthink there was any such common purpose in the minds of the two constableswhen they took the hoy into the alley. They were feeing pestered by theboy in a street in which there was quite a number of people and theyhad, we think, decided to. take him up on a charge. The move into thealley was made, we consider, not for the purpose of getting him into thealley but for the purpose of getting him off the street and it was, in effect,a repetition of what they had earlier done when they took the boy intothe lane opposite the Bay Cafe. We believe that an attempt was madeto &quot;book&quot; the boy and this too negatives the idea of a concerted purpose to chastise him. Further, we think that the remark made by ConstableHarper to Constable Gunn is quite inconsistent with the idea. immediately the blow has been struck Constable Harper rebukes Constable Gunn anddissociates himself. If Constable Harper had been party to a commonpurpose to punish the boy we do not see how this remark could come tohave been made. If more were needed, it could be found in a considerationof the probabilities. If two constables were deliberately minded to inflictpunishment on anyone, is it likely that they would take him into an alleyin full view of at least six persons? We accordingly hold that there wasno concerted purpose and we exonerate Constable Harper from any com-plicity in the striking of the blow. As regards more general criticism ofthe conduct of the two constables, the opinion expressed by the senior officers who gave evidence was that the constables should have brought theboy to the station and charged him there instead Of attempting to do soin the alley. Again it is a question of circumstances, and there may (be something to fee said against the idea of leading a protesting boy throughthe public streets, but we think an error of judgement was made. then it was said that the constables should not have left the boy injured andunattended in the courtyard and we agree with this. They say that -theboy $abjured them to go away and leave him, which may well be true, butwe think their action in leaving him was simply a sequel to the blow andwas due to a desire to get away from an embarrassing situation.-16. Having described what actually took place in the alley and foundthat Constable Gunn assaulted Waters we have, on the face of it, fulfilledthe first branch of our inquiry. But there is a question which naturallyarises at this stage and which, in case our report is thought to be incomplete,we think we should attempt to answer. We also think the question hasto be mentioned in fairness to Constable Gunn. Does it necessarily follow from what we have found that, if the two constables bad been prosecutedin a court of justice, there -would have been a conviction? The answer is that it does not. In the. proceedings before the Tribunal we were ableto, and did, call the two constables to the witness box and it is in partupon the evidence given by them that we base our finding against Gunn.What would have been the position in a prosecution? In a court the twoconstables could not have been called to the witness box and they could have remained silent without prejudice to their defence. Suppose that theyhad chosen to do so, what would the position have been? The evidenceof Waters and those witnesses who saw the policemen take him into thealley combined with evidence of the injury might have sufficed to establish
th/j^b had been assaulted by one or other of the constables but that initself would not have led to a conviction. If it is proved that a crime hasbeen committed and all that is known is that it was committed by one orother of two persons, not acting in concert, there can be no conviction(Docherty v. H.M. Advocate 1945 7.89). In other words it would havebeen necessary in the present case either to identify the assailant or to prove that the two constables had acted in concert. How, then, would the question of identification have stood? Waters gives evidence of aremark made by Constable Harper immediately after the blow had beenstruck and (although the point is open to argument) we shall assume thatthis amounts to an identificatidn of Constable Gunn as the assailantby Waters. But is there anything to corroborate this identification? Itis just here that a prosecutor would have run into difficulty. By the Jawof Scotland no person can be convicted upon the uncorroborated testimonyof a single witness and this rule is extended to cover proof of a major factsuch as identification. The rule is deeply embedded in our practice andit is based upon the fear of a miscarriage of justice. The price we pay for the rule is that from time to time a suspected person even a stronglysuspected person escapes prosecution or conviction. In the present case there would appear to be no corroboration of Waters&apos; identification and,if that was how the matter stood, there could have been no. conviction of Constable Gunn as the assailant. Could it have been held proved thatthe two constables were acting in concert? No doubt there would havebeen an initial inference to that effect but then there would have been theremark which Waters attributes to Constable Harper to consider. In thefact of that remark could it have been held proved and proved beyondreasonable doubt that the two were acting in concert? We cannot speaktoo categorically about a situation which is not before us and which hasnot been fully explored in argument, but our opinion is that, if these twoconstables had been brought to trial in a court, the Crown\ evidence wouldnot have sufficed for a conviction.17. Before leaving this branch of our inquiry we should allude to certainevents which occurred after the incident of 7th December, 1957, and whichwere explored at great length in the evidence. For the most part, they-relate to allegations made by Mr. Waters to the effect that he was approached by, or on behalf of. Constable Harper and offered money to drop the complaint. On the other hand there were counter allegations to the effectthat it was Mr. Waters who made the proposition that he would drop the complaint in exchange for a sum of money. In our view the evidencerelating to these matters was relevant only in so far as it reflected lightupon the events of 7th December. 1957, and from that angle we havehad it in mind in reaching the conclusions already announced. The firstincident concerns Miss Sinclair, a district nurse and a sister of Mrs. Harper.She called at Mr. Waters&apos; house on 9th December, 1957, and Mr. Waterssays that, while they were alone with each other, she appealed to himto drop the complaint and offered to provide a new suit of clothes for theboy. Miss Sinclair denies this but we are inclined to think that an appealwas in fact made. There is no evidence that Constable Harper instigatedthe visit and our view is that it was probably planned between Miss Sinclairand her sister, Mrs. Harper, without the constable&apos;s knowledge.   There
is nothing in this incident.   Next there is the evidence.of Mrs. OaafVidl.a sister of Mr. Waters.   All she effectively says is that Constable FKcipercalled on her after the incident and asked her whether she could do anything about the complaint and this is denied by Constable Harper.   Inconnection with her evidence, however, there is a point which we must mention.In the course of narrating what passed between herself and Constable Harpershe purported to repeat a statement made by Constable Harper as towhat happened in the alley.  The statement was to the effect that ConstableGunn had struck the boy.   We shall revert to this point in the course ofwhat we have to say about the next incident.   The next incident concernsMr. and Mrs. Banks who are neighbours of the Harpers.   Mrs. Banksalso knew Mrs. Waters who was an employee in her grocer&apos;s shop.   Onthe evening of 11th December, 1957, Mr. and Mrs. Banks called at the waters&apos; house and a conversation took place between them and Mr. and mrs. Waters.   Mrs. Banks said that she was very sorry for Mrs. Harperand appealed to Mr. Waters to drop the complaint.   In the course of the visit Mr. Waters had occasion to go to a nearby telephone kiosk andMr. Banks accompanied him.    Mr. Waters says that while they werealone Mr. Banks offered him  50 to drop the complaint and Mr. Banksdenies this.   As the conversation in the house developed it would seem that the attitude taken up by Mr. Waters was to the effect that, if ConstableHarper wanted him to drop the complaint, he should come to see himhimself, and he indicated that, if Constable Harper did so, it might makea difference.   Mr. Banks ultimately went off to fetch Constable Harperbut he did so unwillingly and only after extracting a solemn promisefrom Mr. Waters that what passed at the meeting would never be revealed.Mr. Banks found Constable Harper unwilling to come but he finallypersuaded him to do so.   Then followed a long and no doubt repetitiveconversation, punctuated by cups of tea, which lasted into the smallhours of the morning and of which completely conflicting accounts weregiven.   Mr. and Mrs. Waters maintained that Constable Harper offeredthem money to drop the complaint and said that he would go the lengthof  100.   Mr. Banks and Constable Harper (Mrs. Banks was unable toattend as a witness owing to illness) maintained that it was Mr. Waterswho raised the question of money and who said that, if it was a questionof money, if would be  1,000 he was needing.   We consider that theprobabilities are that Constable Harper did offer to pay money for the dropping of the complaint and we so find.   Mr. Waters&apos; final attitudeseems to have been that he was prepared to drop the complaint againstConstable Harper but only on condition that Constable Harper wouldgive evidence against Constable Gunn and this Constable Harper declined to agree to.   Our view of the incident is that it was wrong for ConstableHarper to have attempted to get the complaint withdrawn for a moneypayment.   It is fair to point out that Constable Harper was not attemptingin any way to tamper with evidence but was approaching the injured party(for the father represented the son) in an attempt to get him to remit hisinjury.   If he had confined himself to making an appeal we might havehad no comment to make but it was certainly wrong for him to have attempted to buy Mr. Waters off.   We pass now to another point arisingout of this incident.   Both Mr. and Mrs. Waters say that in the courseof the conversation Constable Harper made a statement about what happened
in J&amp; alley similar in terms to the statement which Mrs. Campbell sayswaSHide to her, that is to say, a statement exculpating himself and inculpatingConstable Gunn. Although the evidence of Constable Harper and Mr. Bankswas to the contrary effect we are disposed to believe that such a statement was in fact made. In so far as the statement constitutes hearsay evidenceagainst Constable Gunn we have disregarded it entirely. On the other hand,the fact of the statement having been made may legitimately be taken intoaccount in assessing Constable Harper&apos;s credibility when making a differentstatement in the witness box. The next incident relates to a conversation which took place shortly after 7th December, 1957, between ConstableHarper and Mr. Mackay, the stepfather of Mrs. Waters. Mr. Mackaysays that Constable Harper asked him to see Mr. Waters with a view togetting him to drop the complaint and Constable Harper denies this. Thatis all the evidence and we consider that nothing was proved. Finally thereis an incident connected with Mr. Elder, a cousin of Mr. Waters. ConstableHarper says that on a date early in February, 1958 (by which time thecase was out of the hands of the police) while he was on patrol withConstable McBeath, Mr. Elder stopped his car and got out to speak tohim. He quotes Mr. Elder as saying, &quot; Rattles (Mr. Waters) wants you to give Margaret (Mrs. Waters)  60 and he will drop the case against bothof you&quot; and Constable McBeath who overheard the conversation cor-roborates this. Constable Harper says that he brusquely told Mr. Elder togo away and Constable McBeath corroborates. Mr. Elder denies the wholeincident and says there never was an occasion such as the constables describe.We believe that this incident did take place as described by the constablesbut we have no proof that Mr. Elder was acting on the instruction ofMr. Waters and we therefore refrain from comment.18. We pass now to the second branch of the inquiry and to the action taken by the Caithness police. Inspector Carter, who is the officer in chargeat Thurso, was on duty on the night of 7th December, 1957 and first heardof the alleged assault at 11 p.m. when Mr. MacPhee (already referred to)called at the police station to report it. Inspector Carter took a statementfrom Mr. MacPhee and while doing so received a telephone call fromMr. Campbell, to whose house Waters had been taken, reporting the alleged assault and giving the names of Constables Harper and Gunn as thetwo policemen concerned. Inspector Carter finished taking Mr. MacPhee&apos;sstatement and shortly afterwards, when he was preparing to leave in orderto see the boy and make investigations, Mr. Waters arrived at the policestation with his son. The Inspector took them to his private room and took a statement from the father and also, in the presence of the father,a full statement from the son. By the time Mr. Waters and his sonleft, Constables Harper and Gunn were in the police station. InspectorCarter informed them that he had received a complaint from Mr. Watersalleging that they had assaulted his son and that he had further investigationsto make. He warned them that they were not obliged to make a statement and they made no reply. This procedure was the correct procedure.Immediately after this the Inspector telephoned to Chief Constable Georgesonat Wick, to whom he reported the case and asked for instructions. TheChief Constable instructed Inspector Carter to conduct the investigation and,when that had been completed, to send the report not to him but to the
Deputy Chief Constable.- This instruction was a perfectly correct ona^ndwe; should perhaps explain why. A complaint of crime made. &amp;g4*j fi -apoliceman has two aspects. In the first place it is a suspected crime whichhas to be investigated in just the same way as a crime committed by anyother person ; but it is, or may be, also an offence against discipline underthe Police Discipline Code. It is for that reason that the Chief Constablecuts himself off from the investigation. The disciplinary machinery is heldin abeyance while the case is being dealt with as a crime and until thecase is disposed of in one way or another, but ultimately it will, or may,come up as an offence against discipline. When that happens the matter is brought up for trial before the Chief Constable who has to act in a judicialcapacity. For that reason the rule very properly is that, where a policemanis involved, the Chief Constable stands aside from the investigation.19. On the following day being a Sunday Inspector Carter confined himself to visiting the locus. In the succeeding days he proceeded to trace witnessesand take statements until 20th December by which time he had takenstatements from 24 witnesses. Allowing for the other- duties which the inspector had to perform we consider that the investigation was conducted with reasonable despatch. The Inspector had to do his own typing andthe report with typed statements attached was not ready until 23rd December.On that day he took it to Wick and handed it over to Deputy Chief ConstableSutherland. The Deputy Chief Constable questioned Inspector Carter aboutthe investigation, read the report and was satisfied with it. We have men-tioned earlier that Constable Gunn made out a report charging Waters withusing obscene language and molesting the police and this report reachedInspector Carter&apos;s hands on 10th December. Being aware that: this reportrelated to the same matter that he was investigating he judged, quite rightly,that the two reports should go forward together and kept it until the 23rdDecember when he took it to Wick with the other report. Constable Gunn&apos;sreport went to the Chief Constable. On 24th December both reports were passed to Mr. Campbell the Procurator Fiscal. The Procurator Fiscal gave evidence to the effect that he was perfectly satisfied with Inspector Carter&apos;sreport.20. Having held a full inquiry into the events of 7th December we arein a position to say that Inspector Carter succeeded in tracing all thematerial witnesses. We have seen Inspector Carter&apos;s notebook and we have seen the statements as originally taken down by him and as appended intype to his report. Having heard the evidence of the witnesses we aresatisfied that the statements were fully and fairly taken. The report itself is just what such a report should be. The Dean of Faculty did not addressus on this branch of the inquiry, saying that he could find no criticism tomake, and we can find none either. The only criticism of Inspector Carter&apos;work that we can recall came from Mr. Waters who said, in the first place,that his son&apos;s statement was not read back to him but his son, on theother hand, said that it was read back and added that &quot; all that was in thestatement was right&quot;. We have no doubt whatever that Inspector Carterread; back this statement as well as all the other statements taken by him.In the second place Mr. Waters stated emphatically that a second tearsituated in the armpit of his son&apos;s jacket was Shown to Inspector Carterand that the Inspector had failed to include a reference to this tear in his
sorjMtatement; but this was a manifest lie, the truth being that this secondteaJfPvhich is not shown to have anything to do with the case) was onlydiscovered by the son after he got home, as the son himself says.21. We should perhaps refer specifically to the statements which SirDavid Robertson was instrumental in obtaining because we know there wasa good deal of publicity about this and it may have created an impression that the police had been slack. We have seen these statements and thereare 17 of them. Statements from 15 of the persons concerned had alreadybeen taken in fuller form by Inspector Carter and were included among the statements appended to his report. The evidence spoken to by the other two persons was immaterial and added nothing to the information alreadyobtained.22. We accordingly report that we have found the action taken by theCaithness police to have been all that it should have been. The conductof the Chief Constable was in all respects correct and as regards InspectorCarter, who has undeservedly been under a cloud for some considerable time, we feel that it may not be out of place for us to say that we considerthe investigation he made, and the report in which he embodied the resultof that investigation, to have been an excellent bit of work.23. In conclusion we must acknowledge our indebtedness to the Deanof Faculty and those associated with him for their work in collecting andpresenting the evidence, and to our Secretary, Mr. J. M. Macdonald, forthe efficiency with which he made all the numerous arrangements whichhad to be made in connection with our Sittings.J. G. MolntyreJames J.
