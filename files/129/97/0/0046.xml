Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1959C. (59) 96 Copy No. 5811th June, 1959CABINETBOOK EXPORTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the proposals on Book Exports considered by the Cabinet (C. (59) 78) on12th May involved a cost of  250,000 in the current year and  855,000 in a full year. But I suggested a slower build-up to only  650,000 in the second year and 855,000 in the third. I stated also that in each of these years  100,000 could befound within the existing ceiling, so reducing the figures for new money to  150,000, 550,000 and  755,000, less any savings in British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)overseas expenditure (C.C. (59) 31st Conclusions, Minute 1). The Chancellorof the Exchequer said that the most to which he could agree in terms of new money was nil in the current year and  250,000 in the second year. The Cabinet invited me to discuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequer a less costly programme and toreport again.2. By cutting down the main items Book Export Schemes, Low Price Books,Book Presentations and Colonial Libraries a revised programme involvingexpenditure of new money of  100,000,  500,000 and  600,000 in the three years(less any savings on overseas broadcasting) was prepared. I put this less costly andmore gradual plan to the Chancellor of the Exchequer as a compromise. Herejected it, adhering to his proposal of nil in the current year and  250,000 in thesecond.3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer argues that in order to control the constant growth of public expenditure we should keep expenditure on overseas information within the ceiling of  164 millions, apart from the  250,000 offered asan addition next year. Either books are or they are not more important than other types of information work. If they are then other projects should make way forthem. If, for example, books are rated higher than broadcasting, then broadcastingshould be reduced to make way for books. An order of priority should be devisedwithin the ceiling.4. To this general argument I would oppose the equally general argument that our total overseas information effort, as represented by the expenditure of 16^ millions, is small in relation to the need. This is especially true at a timewhen there is the likelihood, because of the stalemate imposed by nuclear weapons,that the struggle between the Communist world and our own will move increasinglyinto the fields of persuasive action and economic aid. Bearing in mind the vastsums we are spending on defence and diplomacy, the sum of  16-1 millions doesnot appear excessive. Over the last two years I have undertaken an intensive studyinto the work of the information services and with the overseas Ministers I am satisfied that the work is now well balanced and contains no &quot; luxuries,&quot; though we are still engaged in a scrutiny of the broadcasting services. We are no lessconvinced that the vast and developing Communist effort in book exports calls for effective counter measures, but not at the expense of weakening the work weare already doing in other fields.55323THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
5. It is possible that the scrutiny of the General Overseas Programme of the bbc will result in savings and certainly I shall do all I can to secure savings that can be justified. What we cannot do is to cut down this service before the scrutinyis complete.67 The book invasion is something relatively new but it has developed swiftly.Public opinion is aware of its existence and anxious about its dangers. members on both sides (in both Houses) are pressing for determined action to deal with the threat. There has been a debate in the House on the subject.7. The problem has been closely studied and modest proposals prepared fordealing with it. In truncated form these mean new money to the tune of  100,000this year,  500,000 next year and  600,000 the year after less anything which issaved by economies in broadcasting expenditure. I find it difficult to answer thatwe cannot afford these sums.C. H.Office of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, S.W. 1,8th June, 1959.
