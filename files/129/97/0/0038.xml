Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1959)C. (59) 88 Copy No.19th May, 1959CABINET\TEACHERS&apos; salaries memorandum by the Minister of education am circulating this paper for the information of the Cabinet, since I thinkthat Ministers will wish to be kept in touch with the progress of the currentBurnham negotiations.2. As I was invited to do (C.C. (59) 30th Conclusions, Minute 7), I informed the leader of the Authorities&apos; Panel of the Burnharn Committee that while I wouldbe ready if need be to approve a maximum for the teachers&apos; basic scale of  1,000and an incremental rate of  27 10s. 0d., I would not be able to accept a. minimumhigher than  510.3. The Authorities&apos; Panel, while appreciating the arguments in favour of 510, have since told me that they do not consider these strong enough to justify their abandoning their proposal to offer a minimum of  520. They are convincedthat this is the least which. the teachers could reasonably be brought to accept.At the last meeting of the Burnham Committee on 13th May, the authorities didnot however go beyond their interim offer of a scale rising from  510 to  975;this was rejected by the teachers. At their next meeting, on 28th May, theauthorities still have a margin within the limits which I am authorised to approve,and they propose to begin by offering a maximum of  1,000. But if the tacticsmake it desirable they may well wish to round off their limit offer by raising theminimum to  520.4. I am sure that I cannot usefully bring further pressure to bear on theAuthorities&apos; Panel by informal means. I have nothing new to tell them, and theyare in any case unwilling to discuss the issues further without bringing in the teachers&apos; Panel; and I cannot tell the teachers the limit to which we are preparedto go while the local, authorities have still not reached that limit in their offers.5. I propose rather to let the negotiations proceed but to suggest to bothsides that they would be well advised to seek my views before giving publicity toany agreement they may reach. They are in any case likely to want to approachme if and when an agreement is in sight. This would give me the opportunity to consult the Cabinet again on the basis of a firm proposal by the burnham committee before any public position is taken up by the Government.6. I do not feel that there is any other action that I can usefully take before thenext meeting of the Committee, but I thought it right to let the Cabinet know thecourse that events are taking.G. L.Ministry of Education, W.1,15 th May, 1959.55203
