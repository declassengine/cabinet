SECRET&apos;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1959C. (59) 99 - &apos; Copy No. * &apos; 56nth June, 1959 ;r:;r: . &apos; y -     : -CABINETINCIDENT AT THIBA DETENTION CAMPMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies circulate for my colleagues&apos; information the following comments onExhibit U of the hold Inquest (attached as Annex) referred to by the attorney-General in Cabinet on 11th June (C.C. (59) 34th Conclusions, Minute 3).2. On 24th April, 1957, when the procedure for converting hard-core MauMau by strict discipline and dilution among co-operating detainees (the &quot; Mweatechnique &quot;) was in its early experimental period, a batch of 30 recalcitrant detaineeswas introduced to Thiba Camp and there mixed with other detainees who were showing signs of increasing co-operation. They were not in Thiba to undergorehabilitation but were in transfer to other camps, previous attempts at theirrehabilitation having failed. They began to win over the co-operatives and managed to persuade 51 of them to revert to an intransigent attitude and reject allrehabilitation.3. Experience had shown that unless open defiance of and challenge toauthority was checked at once, it inevitably led to disturbances, riots, and armedassaults on prisons&apos; staff. Such riots had very recently occurred, in November1956 at Mageta Camp, and on 3rd April, 1957, at Athi River (where the commandant was stabbed).4. The authorities therefore selected, as a test case, the detainees&apos; refusal toattend a football match. The detainees were ordered to leave the compounds and told that force would be used if they disobeyed. The orders were disobeyed andthe detainees moved out by force. Their resistance was overcome; Exhibit Umakes it clear that there was an incipient riot quelled by batons. All but 13 were thus moved to the football field; nine were only slightly injured and four had toreceive hospital treatment, but contrary to the impression given by Exhibit U nonewas seriously hurt as they were all discharged by 7th May. Those at the fieldreturned without incident under escort about an hour later. All involved in the incident were then dispersed in other camps, where they responded satisfactorilyto rehabilitation.5. A short account was given to Parliament on 8th May, 1957; when mr. R. T. Paget commented &quot; that the surprising thing is not how much troublethere has been, but how little.&quot;6.   Thiba was a special case, compared with hold, because:  (i) The detainees who inspired the trouble were rejects from the rehabilitationprocess, in transfer to other places.(ii) The incident occurred early in the development of the &quot; Mwea procedure &quot;and was not strictly connected with it. For two years thereafter theprocedure was followed, under Cowan&apos;s directions, without any similartrouble despite the fact that it was used on still more recalcitrant men.55336
(iii) There was in Thiba imminent danger of trouble in view of the effect onthe co-operating detainees. At hold, although the &quot; closed camp &quot;prisoners were adversely affecting the others, it was not thought thattrouble of this kind was imminent.7. Nevertheless, there are obvious similarities between Thiba and hold. Infact, however, in drawing up his &quot; plan &quot; Cowan did take full account of his experience at Thiba and elsewhere. At Thiba the main trouble occurred in thecompound and not on the way to the football match. At hold Cowan expected,and prepared for, trouble in the closed camp (at the moment of psychologicalchallenge) and not thereafter on the road. No disturbance or difficulty occurred at the football ground or thereafter and experience of the Thiba riot showed thatthis would not be likely at the hold work site, provided Cowan&apos;s plan was strictlyadhered to.A.

ANNEXHOLA INQUEST CASE No. 1 OF 1959Exhibit No. US.26/MISC/DET(Confidential)Commissioner of Prisons (2)P.O. Box 30175,Office of the Staff Officer,.   Em bit District Works Camps.26th April, 1957.Nairobi.Disturbance at ThibaFurther to my signal SOWC./11476/4/57 of 25.4.57 the following are thedetails of this incident.For several days some 60 detainees at Thiba had refused to take any part inRehabilitation activities although they were causing no trouble in other respects.The situation was such that in the evenings these 60 detainees remained behindin the compound while the remainder were on the playing field sometimes ingroups, sometimes en masse, and undoubtedly hardening in their attitude.Accordingly the District Officer in Charge Rehabilitation and I decided thatwe would, if necessary, compel all detainess who refused Rehabilitation (whosenumbers had now increased to 80) to attend the activities on the playing fieldon the evening of April 24th.I ordered the Officer in Charge, Thiba, to detail 50 warders with shields andbatons for the purpose and reinforced this party with the 100 K.E.M. [Kikuyu,Embu and Meru] recruits in training at Karaba who carried batons only.At approximately 4 - 45 p.m. all detainees in Thiba with the exception of 8.1 whohad refused to go, were assembled on the playing field, which had been cordonedoff on the side adjacent to the camp by one platoon of G.S.U. [General Service Unit].The 81 detainees remaining in the compound were called to a meeting and wereordered by the District Officer in Charge Rehabilitation to proceed outside to theplaying field. This they refused to do, whereupon they were warned that force wouldbe used if they persisted in their refusal. They were given some five minutes todecide on the expiration of which I ordered the warders to enter the compound and carry out a pre-arranged plan to surround the whole group, and this manoeuvre was completed without incident. A small party of warders was then detailed to take thefirst two rows (comprising 10 detainees) out of the compound one by one, and it was at this point that a general uproar ensued in which most of the detainees receivedblows with batons. Ultimately some 70 detainees were removed to the playing field,the remainder having been taken to the camp dispensary for treatment. At thisstage a European Officer was despatched to Embu to fetch a doctor and to informthe District Commissioner what had occurred.About 6 p.m. the 70 detainees concerned in the disturbance were escorted fromthe playing field to a separate compound; meanwhile the more severely injured hadbeen attended by the camp dresser who then proceeded to examine the remainder.Later the same evening an African Medical Officer from Embu examined allinjured detainees and four were subsequently conveyed to hospital one with abroken leg, another broken ribs, a third with a head injury and the fourth probablysuffering from acute hysteria.Of the original 81 detainees involved 5 have now returned to the main compoundvoluntarily, 72 are still segregated and receiving medical attention and 4 are inEmbu hospital.J. B. T. COWAN.Staff Officer,Embu District Works Camps.
