THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF &quot;&quot;BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT&quot;Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1959C. (59) 8919th May, 1959Copy No.55CABINETKLAUS&apos; FUCHSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Lord Privy SealKlaus Fuchs, who was sentenced on 28th February, 1950, to 14 years&apos;imprisonment for communicating information calculated to be useful to an enemy,completes his sentence on 29th June. I have been considering, in consultation withthe Foreign Office and others specially concerned, the position which will then arise.2. Fuchs was a naturalised British subject at the time of his conviction, buthe was deprived of his British nationality thereafter. He is probably now stateless.It seems clear that, in these circumstances, we have no effective means of determining where he will live on his release. If he does not wish to leave theUnited Kingdom and if no other country to which he wishes to go is willing to admit him we cannot prevent his staying here. If, on the other hand, he doeswish to go abroad, and can arrange to do so, we cannot stop him. In theory wecould refuse him leave to embark; but it is doubtful whether such a refusal couldbe enforced, and we do not, in any event, appear to have any moral justification for detaining him in a country which has deprived him of its nationality.3. Fuchs has said that he intends to go to East Germany to live with hisfather who is very old in Leipzig. If this happens, there may be criticism bothin this country and in America of our allowing an eminent atomic scientist to gobehind the Iron Curtain. The answer, as already indicated, is that we have no effective means of stopping him. The risk that he might be an asset to the Russiansdoes not, in fact, seem to be very high, because, while he has a first-classmathematical brain, his knowledge of atomic science must now be very out of date.4. I propose, therefore, to tell him that he may arrange to leave this country if he wants- to during the latter part of June; and to facilitate his transport to thepoint of embarkation in a way which will minimise though it will not remove the risks of publicity. In the meantime, as we are being asked to say what will happen to him on his release, I propose to answer a Parliamentary Question as in the draft annexed to this paper.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,14th May, 1959.55204
