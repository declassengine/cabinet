secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1959C. (59) 73 Copy No.   6824th April, 1959CABINET.SPACE RESEARCHMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilWe have been under pressure for some time to define our attitude to space research. The object of this paper is to report to my colleagues the presentsituation, and to make proposals.The Present Position2. British scientists have already made notable contributions in this field.Our universities, the Radio-Telescope at Jodrell Bank, Ministry of SupplyEstablishments, and the Slough Radio Research Station of the Department of scientific and Industrial Research (D.S.I.R.) have shown that we are in the leadin &quot; tracking&quot; the satellites already put up by the United States and Russia.Our programme of SKYLARK rockets launched at Woomera, for takingmeasurements by &quot; vertical sounding &quot; of the atmosphere and stratosphere, has gone very well. Our objective should, I suggest, be to develop a space programmedesigned to give the highest possible scientific dividends consistently with reasonable cost, in a field where, of course, expense as well as research tends to be astronomical. I do not think that in a matter of this kind we shouldprimarily be concerned with considerations of national prestige. As the AdvisoryCouncil on Scientific Policy (A.C.S.P.) have observed, scientific prestige is obtainedonly through research of real scientific importance. It does not depend on the size or spectacular nature of the project. Projects designed primarily for prestigeare likely to fail in their main objective.3. With this general end in view, a group of members of the Royal Societyrecently worked out, in collaboration with experts from the Ministry of Supply, a programme of experimental work with earth satellites which, on present knowledge,they consider likely to be most valuable scientifically. The programme is, in essence, one for the design and construction of instruments to be &quot; flown &quot; in earthsatellites launched in suitable rocket vehicles. The instruments will be used to makea wide variety of measurements, for instance, of the atmosphere, ionosphere, andmagnetic field of the earth, long-term meteorological research, astronomicalobservations and measurements of radiations inaccessible at the surface of the earth, and the study of cosmic radiation and interplanetary dust.4. I arranged for this programme to be referred to the A.C.S.P. They havenow recommended that there is a strong case, on scientific grounds, for a carefullyplanned programme of research of this type, requiring initially perhaps five earthsatellites. They consider that such earth satellites provide a means of enlargingconsiderably our knowledge of the planet on which we live, and from that pointof view are more important than the more ambitious type of space exploration.On the other hand, the A.C.S.P. have expressed the definite opinion that schemesof research involving lunar, planetary or solar probes are for us unwarrantedbecause their cost is likely to be disproportionate to their scientific value, and thatthe financial and other scientific resources which such schemes would entail couldbe put to far more rewarding scientific purpose.SECRET55094 B
5. The work involved to perform the kinds of experiments recommended bythe scientists falls under three main, technically inter-connected, heads, namely,the provision of instruments, the provision of satellites to carry the instruments and the provision of rockets to launch the satellites.Instruments- 6. The instruments required must be designed to meet the needs of the specificexperiments proposed. I am advised that the design and manufacture of the instruments required by the proposed programme would cost a sum of the orderof  100,000 to  200,000 a year. I am further advised that the instruments couldbe designed and produced within two or three years. Clearly, the provision ofsuch instruments is a fundamental requirement of any United Kingdom space research programme, and I therefore recommend that we should agree to this programme of instrumentation and that we should provide the funds. An early announcement of our intention is important in order to end uncertainties in the universities and, as explained later, for the negotiations about satellites andlaunching arrangements. I therefore advise, that our public commitment to sucha programme should be made known without delay.7. I should emphasise that the instrument programme of  100,000 to  200,000a year does not include the satellites themselves, still less the launching rockets, andit would be unrealistic to think that our financial commitment might not eventually be much larger. Moreover, there would be many serious difficulties, partly politicalbut mainly technical, in arranging a co-operative programme with other nations to incorporate our instruments in satellites provided and launched by someone else.I believe we must recognise now that such provision as I propose above is only a first instalment of what might ultimately become a more costly space research programme.Rockets and Satellites to Carry the Instruments8. The performance of the United States and Russia up to date shows that a wide variety of rockets can be used for launching earth satellites, and that the satellites to carry the instruments can be of widely differing designs. But it is obviousthat in practice there must be close collaboration between the designers ofinstruments, satellites and rockets.9. Here we have to consider the politically and technically complex questionof possible international, or Anglo-American-Commonwealth, collaboration. Onthis, the A.C.S.P. commented that it would, of course, be simplest for the UnitedKingdom to launch its own satellites. According to the A.C.S.P. this could be done with American-built rockets or by some modification of BLUE STREAK. On theassumption that BLUE STREAK continues to be developed for military purposes,the Ministry of Supply estimate that this alternative would cost us between 10 millions and  20 millions spread over five years, and that this sum would includethe provision of five satellites and their launching vehicles. But the A.C.S.P.considered that there are obvious dangers in tying to a military project a scientificprogramme which as yet is of no definable military value and which would not,under any circumstances, warrant the expenditure necessary for the completedevelopment of a rocket vehicle. The A.C.S.P. were also not prepared to say thatthey could regard a programme for five terrestrial satellites, to carry the instrumentsrecommended in the scientific programme, as justifying the expenditure of 10 millions to  20 millions as an addition to our civil science research budget.Other projects could well have a higher priority if such an additional sum were tobecome freely available for civil science. The A.C.S.P. therefore recommended that,as a first step, an immediate approach be made to the United States to ascertainunder what terms suitable rockets might be made available, since, if they wereobtainable cheaply, this might offer the cheapest and quickest solution. TheA.C.S.P. also considered it desirable that the possibility of Commonwealth (or united Kingdom-Canada-Australia), or Commonwealth-United States, co-operation in the launching of satellites be explored at once. There might be both technical andfinancial reasons for doing this.10. I should record here that there already exists an international scientificorganisation in this field, the Committee on Space Research known as COSPAR(set up by the International Council of Scientific Unions as the focal point for
collaboration between the international learned organisations for physics,chemistry and the other scientific disciplines). The British end of this scientificactivity is looked after by the British National Committee on Space Research,convened by the Royal Society, containing the leading scientific and official expertson space research. The Chairman of this Committee is Professor H. S. W. Massey,Professor of Physics, University College, London,. who, in practice, acts as a central point for most of the United Kingdom scientific activity in this field. TheRussians are, at present, collaborating in COSPAR.The Recent United States Offer11. As a coincidence, very shortly after the A.C.S.P. reported, a UnitedStates representative informed COSPAR that the United States had offered toundertake, free of charge, the launching of satellites instrumented by scientists ofother countries. This fits in well with the A.C.S.P.&apos;s recommendation referred toabove.12. Recent discussions in the United States have shown lack of precisionabout the imaginative offer, to &quot; fly &quot; other countries&apos; instruments, made by the americans. The United States civilian agency concerned, the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration (N.A.S.A.), plan to use a new rocket, theSCOUT, which is not yet operational. We do not yet know what proportion ofthe experiments recommended by our scientists, and the instruments which weshall develop for them, can, in practice, for technical reasons, be flown by the americans. We do not know what restrictive, or other, conditions the Americansmay impose, though it is fair to say that the American approach seems veryflexible. They would be ready to &quot; fly &quot; instruments, or even &quot; black boxes,&quot; orcomplete satellites made by us, or might sell us rockets for launching ourselves.They would apparently consider both an Anglo-American operation, and anentirely international one, under COSPAR. Needless to say, complete international collaboration in this field might prove very difficult to negotiate and organise.13. The only possible conclusion on the American offer, at this stage, wouldseem, therefore, to be that a party of experts should be sent to. the United states at once armed with our decision to go ahead with the instrument programme and report back about what proportion of this programme could, if this is acceptablepolitically to us, be &quot; flown &quot; by United States rockets, and what the technical andfinancial implications would be.A British, or Commonwealth, Programme of Launcfaings14. As indicated in paragraph 9, the Ministry of Supply have estimated thatthe cost of modifying BLUE STREAK to provide five satellites and launchingvehicles would be of the order of  10 millions to  20 millions over five years. Ishould like to make it clear that I have a completely open mind on the extent towhich we should go along this road. A BLUE STREAK satellite programme may prove in the end especially if it has a strong Commonwealth element to bedesirable both technically and politically. But what does seem clear is that wecannot, at this stage, come to any decision on this matter until we know what arethe technical, financial and political implications of the United States offer. L thinkthat we should be quite frank on this in any statement we make. In coming toa final decision on the launching aspects of our programme, we may well need more information as to the potential importance from the point of view of British&quot; know-how,&quot; industrial development, &amp;c, of being &quot; in on &quot; launching rockets,satellite design, &amp;c, as well as on the planning of the instruments to carry out theactual experiments.Questions of Organisation15. This paper has been prepared after discussion among senior officials, and,at this point, I should like to record their recommendations on variousadministrative points (a) I understand that the consensus of official opinion is that, as the basicobject of this exercise would be the advancement of scientific knowledge,it would be right for the Lord President of the Council, as the Ministergenerally responsible for civil science, to be regarded as the Ministerprimarily responsible for the space programme. If my colleagues agree, I am ready to accept this view.55094
(b) But the subject is, of course, of close concern to a number of departments and other bodies, spanning a much wider field than the organisationsunder the Lord President. I recognise particularly that the Ministry ofSupply, quite apart from what I might call the BLUE STREAK element,have already made, and must continue to make, a massive contribution in this whole field.(c) In view of the wide range of interests concerned, officials think that thereis a need for what we might call a Steering Group. This would includesenior representatives (i) of the bodies with executive parts to play inthe space programme, e.g., the Ministry of Supply, the Air Ministry, theD.S.I.R., and the British National Committee on Space Research (animportant source of scientific advice, and providing a link withCOSPAR), and also (ii) of other bodies with a more general interest,e.g., the Royal Society, the Treasury, the Ministry of Defence and theForeign Office. The choice of Chairman will be important. I endorse the officials&apos; recommendation as to the need for a Steering Group onSpace Research, and I think we should proceed to set it up at once.id) On the matter of Vote accountability, the different Departments concerned,e.g., Ministry of Supply and D.S.I.R., would finance their componentsof the programme from their respective Votes. Much of the proposed expenditure on the development of instruments would consist of grants to teams in Universities and these could conveniently be administeredthrough the D.S.I.R.&apos;s existing organisation. I believe that the royal society would prefer to be given a block grant by the Treasury, whichthey could themselves disburse to the Universities but this seemsinappropriate for a Government programme of this kind. We must,however, secure the full co-operation of the Royal Society, and theyshould therefore be given adequate representation on the steering group.(e) The Foreign Office has recalled that the United Nations General Assembly,in the autumn of 1958, set up an ad hoc Committee on the Peaceful&apos;Uses of Outer Space, which the Soviet Union has, unfortunately,indicated it will boycott. One of the tasks of the ad hoc Committeeis to recommend the form of United Nations organisation required to handle the United Nations &quot;aspects of peaceful collaboration on space research in the future. The Foreign Office have been advised that international scientific activities in this field could best be handled byCOSPAR. The United Kingdom representative on the Committee,which meets in May, is being briefed in this sense, and .also to resist any proposal for setting up, at any rate at present, a United NationsSpecialised Agency; but he could support a recommendation by thepresent United Nations ad hoc Committee that a continuing Committeeof the United Nations should be created to carry on the work for thetime being.Summary land Suggested Government Announcement16.   My recommendations can be summarised as follows (1) We should take a decision to embark upon a space programme, the objective of which would be the obtaining of scientific information,and confined, at present at any rate, to experiments with earthsatellites (excluding &quot; probes &quot; to the moon, the planets, or further).(2) The first step in such a programme must be the design, by the scientists,of instruments to make the measurements. Such an instrumentprogramme, estimated to cost a figure of the order of  100,000 to 200,000 *a year, has been recommended by the scientists and blessedby the A.C.S.P. I advise that we should accept this programme, providethe funds for it, and announce this publicly.(3) The Americans have recently offered to &quot; fly &quot; instruments designed byother countries. We cannot come to final conclusions about thetechnical, financial and political implications of this offer until wehave much more detailed information about it. An expert team should therefore be sent to the United States at once.
(4) Until we have much more information about the American offer, wecannot decide to what extent we should ourselves plan to embark on launching instruments and satellites by an adaptation of our ownBLUE STREAK rockets. If we decide to embark on such anadaptation, it may cost  10 millions to  20 millions over five years, abovethe cost of BLUE STREAK attributable to defence.(5) In order to co-ordinate the United Kingdom work on the spaceprogramme, a Space Research Steering Group should be set up, withrepresentatives of the Departments and expert bodies concerned, underthe general aegis of the Lord President.17. As I have explained, there are a number of reasons, including the need to clear up the position about the instrument programme well in advance of theuniversity academic year, which I consider make it desirable for an immediate announcement to be made. I attach a draft.HAILSHAM.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S.W. 1,23rd April, 1959.BRITISH SPACE RESEARCH PROGRAMMEDraft Statement by the Prime Minister in the House of commons and the Lord President in the House of LordsBritish scientists are already playing a distinguished part in space exploration,through our programme of SKYLARK rockets fired at Woomera in collaboration with the Australians for the &quot; vertical sounding&quot; of the atmosphere andstratosphere, and in our achievements in the accurate tracking of United Statesand Russian satellites by the Jodrell Bank Radio-Telescope and elsewhere. Forsome time our scientific experts have been planning a more ambitious programmeof experimental work with instruments designed and constructed in this countryand flown by satellites orbiting the earth. The programme will be designed toincrease our scientific knowledge of our own planet and its surrounding atmosphere,stratosphere and ionosphere. It should also enable us to make observations of theheavenly bodies and cosmic rays in ways impracticable from the earth&apos;s surface.The Advisory Council on Scientific Policy have recommended that thisexperimental programme should be proceeded with at once, in the interests of scientific progress. They also consider that the probable scientific advantage tothis country to be obtained from lunar or planetary probes or excursions would notat present be likely to be commensurate with the cost.The Government accept these recommendations. We agree that our basicobjective should be the potential contribution to scientific knowledge, and that weshould not approach the matter as contestants in a so-called &quot; space race.&quot;The scientific programme for designing and manufacturing instruments islikely to cost some  100,000 to  200,000 a year. This sum the Government havedecided to make available, and the scientists concerned in the Universities and elsewhere will be authorised to go ahead with the work immediately.This design work on instruments will inevitably take some time and can, weare advised, proceed in advance of a final decision as to the rockets necessary to fly them. As to this the Government have a choice between either or both of two possibilities. Either we can, at any rate in the first instance, seek to employAmerican-built rockets, or we can develop rocket vehicles of our own constructioneither by ourselves or in conjunction with other Members of the Commonwealth.The United States have recently made a generous offer to fly instruments orsatellites designed by other countries by means of their own rocket launchers.
This offer was made to COSPAR, the International Scientific Committee on space research, established under the auspices of the International Council for ScienificUnions, in liaison with which the Royal Society have established a British national committee on Space Research, which is planning the details of the instrumentprogramme.The Americans have made their offer in general terms, and the next step,as we see it, must be detailed technical discussions between the experts as to the scientific, technical and financial implications. In particular, of course, we shalldesire to study the technical feasibility of the different instruments, planned under our experimental programme, being launched with American rockets. Thesetechnical discussions may well take some time. Only after this can theGovernment come to a decision about our response to the American offer. Inthe meantime, as is well known, the BLUE STREAK programme, which couldbe adapted to provide an initial launcher, is going ahead.A number of bodies in the United Kingdom are already playing a considerable part in space research matters. These include the Royal Society, the british national Committee on Space Research under the chairmanship of ProfessorH. S. W. Massey, the Ministry of Supply, several of whose establishments aremaking big contributions quite apart from their responsibility for BLUE STREAK,and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, particularly through itsRadio Research Station. The Government propose that this matter should betreated primarily as one of civil scientific research and I have asked the lord president [the Prime Minister has asked me] to exercise general supervision of theprogramme, in close consultation with the Minister of Supply and the other ministers concerned.
