Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1959C. (59) 91 Copy No.      g \29th May, 1959CABINETCOMMERCIAL POLICY: HORTICULTUREMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodAlternatives to the tariff on 12th February we agreed to increase the tariff on certain cut flowers(C.C. (59) 7th Conclusions, Minute 4). This decision has been interpreted as showing that the refusal of other tariff applications did not indicate a change ofpolicy by the Government, which still regards the tariff as the main instrument for supporting the horticultural part of the agricultural industry. Following our discussion in Cabinet I have again been reviewing alternative methods of support,some of which were discussed in my memorandum C. (59) 18.2. I have come to the conclusion that in present circumstances there is no alternative measure that would be a practicable substitute for the tariff as a generalmeans of support for horticulture. But as I indicate (in paragraphs 7 and 8 below)there may be possibilities for individual commodities in minimum price schemes.And we can do something on production grants (see paragraph 5).3.   Alternatives that I have reviewed include (i) Deficiency payments.(ii) Production grants.(iii) Import quotas.(iv) Minimum price schemes.Deficiency Payments4. It seems impossible to operate for horticulture a system of deficiency round, whether paid in relation to output or acreage, that embodies adequate safeguards for the Exchequer yet avoids revolutionary changes in the existingmarketing system.Direct Grants5. The scope for direct grants is very limited. We have already decided tointroduce a scheme for grants towards buildings and equipment on horticulturalholdings (C.C. (59) 1st Conclusions, Minute 2). My officials are still working onthe details, but I hope we can get it going next spring after the necessary legislation.When we have the Monopolies Commission^ report on the fertiliser industry, weshall also need to examine the possibility of a potash subsidy, which wouldparticularly help horticulture and for which the National Farmers&apos; Unions(N.F.U.&apos;s) have long been pressing. But grants of this kind, though important,can only offer supplementary aid to the industry.55258TH1S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
Import Quotas6. It seems out of the question to contemplate a general reversion to quotas for horticultural products. Apart from the obvious difficulties which would arise under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, quotas have the disadvantage of rigidity in operation. Quotas are, however, still operated for apples and pearsand have to be justified on balance of payments grounds. But our import duties on these products are designed to protect the Commonwealth rather than the home producer; they have been bound at levels that afford no protection to homeapple growers and little protection to our pear growers. There is no prospectof our being able to negotiate effective rates. There is a similar difficulty withregard to bulbs. The time may well come when some alternative to quotas asa means of protection must be found for these products. We are committed toprior consultation with the interests concerned before removal of the quota restrictions.Minimum Price Schemes7. I referred in paragraph 4 (a) of C. (59) 18 to the possibility of minimum price schemes for some horticultural commodities. Officials are looking into the implications of such schemes from the point of view of our commercial policy.I think such a scheme might be feasible for apples and pears. But this couldonly be decided after full discussion of the practical implications with the various interests concerned. Accordingly I seek authority to open confidential discussions, as soon as possible, with the N.F.U.&apos;s and trade interests about thepossibility of such a scheme for apples and pears. This would not cast doubt on our general policy, since it is generally accepted that the tariff for those fruitscannot be adjusted to give reasonable protection.8. If these discussions go well, they might be extended to cover other commodities such as bulbs, onions and possibly tomatoes, if that could be done without casting doubt on our statement that the tariff is the main instrument of support for horticulture.The Tariff Advisory committee. When we were considering the last batch of applications for increases inthe tariffs on horticultural products, we ran into difficulty in squaring the advicetendered by the Tariff Advisory Committee (T.A.C.) with what we finally agree the realities of the situation required. I have given some thought to this andhave come to the conclusion that the principles upon which the T.A.C.&apos;s conclusions are based may have contributed to our difficulties. Those general principles maybe quite sound for most industries but I doubt very much whether, when appliedto horticulture, they take sufficiently into account the Governmenfs obligationstoward the industry.Those principles are &quot; (i) The tariff is the normal means of protection for the horticultural industry.(ii) The existing tariff, which was fixed in ...... after a full examination ofthe position then obtaining, should be taken as a starting point andit should be for consideration what adjustment, if any, would berequired in the light of present circumstances.(iii) Additional tariff protection should, as far as possible, assure to the efficient United Kingdom producer a fair return on, and a reasonable prospect of a market for, his produce without hardship to theconsumer.&quot;10. What disturbs me about these is that they do not reflect in any way thefact that in the Agriculture Act, 1947, Parliament has accorded to agriculturecertain assurances which apply no less to horticulture than to the rest of theindustry. It seems to me, therefore, that to treat a tariff application affectinghorticulture as though that Act did not exist cannot be right. I suggest, therefore,that when such applications are being considered a&apos; fourth principle should beadded as follows &quot; Account must be taken of the Governmenfs obligations arising out ofthe Agriculture Act, 1947.&quot;
Points for Decision11.   I ask my colleagues-(i) To authorise me (a) To open confidential discussions with the N.F.U.&apos;s and the trade interests about the feasibility of a minimum price scheme forapples and pears (paragraph 7).(b) If the discussions about apples and pears go well, to exploreconfidentially with the interests concerned the feasibility ofschemes for other commodities (paragraph 8).(ii) To agree that when the Tariff Advisory Committee is consideringapplications for increases in the horticultural tariff, the principles guidingthe Committee&apos;s work should include suitable reference to theGovernments obligations under the Agriculture Act, 1947(paragraph 10).J. H.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S.W. 1,28th May, 1959.
