2 2 o(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY O - HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 9710th June, 1959KE ;YA;   REHABILITATION PC-policy AND THEUSE OF FORCED LABOURMemorandum by the Seeretary of State for the ColoniesYesterday the Prime Minister asked me to circulate, for theinformation of my colleagues, a note explaining the circumstances underwhich approval was given to the use of forced labour in the rehabilitation of detainees in Kenya.2. Early in 1954 plans were made for &quot;Anvil&quot;, an operation designedto break the power of Mau Mau in Nairobi.   This move was recommended bya joint Parliamentary Delegation (the late Sir Waiter Elliot andMr. A.G. Bottom ley), and proved in fact to be the turning-point in the fight against Mau Mau.   It was foreseen, however, that this would involvethe detention of many tens of thousands in addition to those already held,and the Governor and his advisers thought it essential that powers shouldexist to enable them to be put to work, at least in certain camps, as partof their rehabilitation.3. My predecessor thought it necessary to seek the approval of hiscolleagues to the Governor&apos;s proposals and a memorandum (C.(54) 50)was therefore put to them.   2 or that paper, Cabinet sanction was soughtnot only for the policy as such, but for the technical breach of theInternational Labour Organisation Forced Labour Convention of 1930 whichit was thought might be involved.4. Before the Cabinet considered the paper, however, officials metto study the regulations, which laid down that persons in special detentioncamps should be &quot;usefully employed in work of a type calculated to assistthe process of rehabilitation&quot;    and shall do &quot;such work not of an oppressiveor penal nature&quot; as the officer in charge might require.   An alternativeformula, which is now embodied in the relevent regulation, was found:   itread that every person detained in such camps &quot;may be usefully employedin work which the officer in charge is satisfied will assist in bringing theEmergency to an end, and to that end shall do such work of the natureaforesaid as he may be required to do by the officer in charge&quot;.5. As a result my predecessor was able to inform his colleagues thatit would now be possible to carry out the proposals of the Governor withoutrisking a successful challenge under the Conventions establishing our international obligations in relation to forced labour.COPY NO.
