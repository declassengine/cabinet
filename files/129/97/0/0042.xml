.   ^SECRET.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1959C. (59) 92 Copy No.   1)62nd June, 1959 : ,CABINETHOLA DETENTION CAMPMemorandum by the Minister of State for Colonial affairs as the Cabinet will be aware, there is widespread public disquiet over thedeaths of 11 Mau Mau detainees at hold Detention Camp in Kenya as a resultof what happened on 3rd March. There is no doubt that detainees were on that day illegally beaten and the investigating magistrate so found. He also foundthat some of the force used was legal. The fact remains that 11 detainees diedand 23 were so seriously injured as to require admission to hospital, apart fromothers with lesser injuries. It is to be expected that the Opposition will make this the basis of an attack and the object of this paper is to inform the Cabinet of theposition and to survey the defences on which we should rely to meet the attackif and when it comes. I apologise for the length of this paper, but I feel that theCabinet should be fully informed about the hold tragedy. I am indebted to the attorney-General for the presentation of the facts set out below.2. Early on 3rd March, Sullivan, the Camp Commandant took 85 hard-coreMau Mau detainees who had refused to co-operate out of the camp with theintention of getting them to work in &quot;digging a trench a short distance away.They were taken out under a strong escort.3. The Kenya Government had decided that efforts should be made to getthese detainees to work, and Sullivan had been seen by a senior officer, Cowan,and given verbal instructions. Cowan&apos;s intention was that detainees should betaken out in small batches and put to work. He expected trouble in getting themto leave the camp to work. Sullivan avoided this by not telling the detainees theywere being taken out to work and he got all the 85 out in one party.4. Cowan put his proposals in writing but the written document was not seen by Sullivan until after 3rd March. His written proposal contained thefollowing passage:  &quot; It is assumed that the party (of detainees) would obey this order (togo to work) but should they refuse to work they would be manhandled to the site of work and forced to carry out the task.&quot;5. A distinction is drawn by the Kenya authorities between the use ofcompelling force to secure obedience to an order, e.g., taking a man by force outof a cell which he has been ordered to leave when he refuses to go, and punitiveforce, i.e., endeavouring to secure obedience by the infliction of pain. Manhandlingto the site was consequently considered legitimate. The evidence before the magistrate showed that Cowan and Sullivan both knew the legal limits as to theapplication of force.6. The investigating magistrate was very critical of the use of the expression&quot; forced to carry out the task &quot; on the ground that the natural meaning of thosewords sanctioned the use of force to make the detainees work.7. To those concerned with the prison administration, with knowledge ofthe circumstances when the use of force was permissible, it is said that these wordscould not have this significance.   The use of force to make men work is illegal55286B
arid the Minister and senior officials who sanctioned the Cowan &quot; plan &quot;cannot have intended to sanction illegality. ;8. Sullivan&apos;s instructions to his African staff were given in Swahili and aliteral translation is as follows:  &quot; If people make trouble, you will hit him.   But you will only hit onIJi; . legs. ;;:Do.n&apos;t entirely hit.&quot; &apos; ; ..In Msf evidence to the magistrate he also said that sufficient force including theuse of batons Was to be used to overcome violent resistance, that it was left to individual warders to use force to restore Order if the situation was getting out of hand and there&apos; was any great noise or movement.9. It will no doubt be alleged that Cowan&apos;s verbal instructions to Sullivan musthave tallied with his written report, and Sullivan&apos;s instructions to his men are notunfortunately inconsistent with the use of force to make men work. Accordingto the Chief Warder they were instructed to make the detainees work and if they refused to do so they were to hit them on their legs but not seriously.10. Cowan&apos;s and Sullivan&apos;s evidence before the magistrate shows that they didnot discuss the use of force to make the detainees work and that all Cowan said wasthat if they lay down and refused to work they were to be lifted up again.11. After the detainees had gone 100 yards or so from the camp, they appearto have realised that they were being taken to work and there was a disturbance.The accounts of what happened are confused but it is clear that batons were thenused. The magistrate appears to have found that there was an attempt to escape(though the evidence in support of this conclusion is not very strong and thisfinding may be challenged) and also that there was a &quot;combined outbreak.&quot; he found that the use of batons on this occasion was legal. He criticised Sullivan&apos;sevidence that the detainees formed a Mau Mau pyramid but accepted that thedetainees had piled on top of each other on the road. There appears no doubt thatwhen piled on top of each other they were beaten.12. Sullivan succeeded in restoring order but two men had to be carried to the site, whether or not in consequence of injuries is not clear.13. At the site the detainees were taken to the trench which is 100 ft. longand divided into groups of about 20. Sullivan&apos;s intention appears to have been thatpicks and shovels should be put in their bands and that the warders should forciblycompel them to go through the motions of using them. Again the evidence of what happened is very confused. One version is that after the detainees had sat down thewarders tried by words to persuade them to work and, having failed, then beat themwith batons while they were sitting. This version is to some extent supported by thefact that of those who died, one received a fractured skull, his and another&apos;s brainswere damaged, one had a fractured jaw and two had fractured forearms. Some ofthese injuries may have been suffered in the road incident. Another version(Sullivan&apos;s) is that the men twice formed heaps again,14.   The investigating magistrate found and the finding will not appearcapable of challenge that the men were illegally beaten to make them work, but ha-said that possibly the use of batons at the site at times was justified to prevent anescape and subdue a combined outbreak.15. He found that the deaths were due to shock and haemorrhage due tomultiple bruising caused by violence. The bruising was not readily visible on external examination owing to the colour of their skins. The post mortemexaminations revealed that there had been very extensive internal bleeding. Therewas evidence that scurvy leads both to lessened resistance to shock and toexcessive bleeding. After the deaths a medical witness discovered two severe cases ofscurvy in the camp and the Magistrate was satisfied that scurvy was present in the camp, and possibly widespread. When all the seriously ill after the beatings on 3rd March were treated as probably suffering from scurvy, there was a great improvement in their health. This medical witness also said that where there isascorbic acid deficiency &quot; any degree of beating might well cause a fatal issue&quot;and that one could not assess the severity of a blow from internal bleeding if theman was suffering from scurvy. No fresh vegetables were issued to the detainees.Anti-scorbutic pills were issued with the rations but no steps appear to have beentaken to see whether the detainees took them.
The investigating magistrate was critical of the arrangements for preventingscurvy but although he dealt with this subject in his findings, he did not express the view that scurvy was a factor contributing to the deaths.16. Before his inquiry&quot;the Criminal Investigation Department carried out an investigation and the results of&apos;their work were made, available to him. Thedetainees would not co-operate even to the extent of identifying the dead. A few of them eventually gave evidence but their evidence was clearly regarded by the magistrate as of very little value. He did not consider, that the evidence disclosedthe commission of an.;offence by an identifiable, person. .;The,, Attorney-Generalof Kenya has considered the question of prosecution and has decided that criminal proceedings should not be instituted. A copy of his memorandum to ;the Kenya government giving his reasons is attached at Annex I.17. Serious disciplinary charges have been preferred against Sullivan andCoutts, his assistant. A copy of the charges is attached at Annex II. the investigation of these charges which is expected to commence on 4th June is bya service disciplinary Committee headed by the Solicitor-General of Kenya. Ithas been agreed that the proceedings and findings of the Committee will be made public after a decision has been reached as to the action to be taken.18. A strong and independent Committee of three has also been appointedto advise the Governor on the future administration of the four remainingEmergency Detention Camps and this will begin work in Kenya on 16th June.The International Committee of the Red Cross have also, been given permission to send delegates again to visit the camps as they did in 1957.19. The Opposition attack appears likely to be based on one or more ofthe following allegations (i) Having regard to the many allegations of beatings which have been communicated to the Colonial Secretary, action should have been taken before 3rd March and if it had been taken, the events of that day atHola might not have occurred.(ii) The Kenya Government having authorised the Cowan &quot; plan &quot; must betaken to have authorised the use of illegal force.(iii) The presence of scurvy in the camp is indicative of bad administrationfor which the Government is responsible.(iv) The decision of the Attorney-General was wrong.(v) The Kenya Government attempted to mislead the public by issuing a press statement (criticised by the magistrate) which suggested that thedeaths were due to drinking contaminated water.20. In reply to (i) it can be said that all the complaints received have been thoroughly investigated. The vast majority were found to be baseless. Whereinvestigation showed there was any substance in the complaint, appropriate action,including in some cases prosecution, was taken, and details of these cases are attached hereto at Annex III. It should be remembered that no less than 80,000detainees had to be looked after, of whom 79,000 have been successfully releasedoto normal life. All the detainees at hold who gave evidence testified, and some50 or so others questioned by the magistrate at hold said, that before 3rd Marchthere has not been beatings at hold, so that if the complaints received had led to action, there is no reason to suppose that it would have led to any action at hold.None the less this would seem the most likely line of attack in debate.21. In reply to (ii), it can be pointed out that Prison Standing Orders andOrdinances make it clear that men cannot lawfully be forced to work by beatingthem; and that the use of illegal force was not sanctioned by those in authority.Cowan had not authority to and according to his and Sullivams evidence did notauthorise the use of illegal force.22. As to (iv) the decision of the Attorney-General is his and not theGovernments responsibility,. The investigating magistrate has reached the sameconclusion.23. As to (v) the Press statement may have been ill judged. It was founded on preliminary reports. There was ho intention to mislead or to cover up and thisis shown by the fact that a full inquiry Was initiated immediately, and before thePress statement was made.55286
Colonial Office, S.W.1.1st June, 1959.24. I have had long discussions with the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General on these matters (the Attorney-General for Kenya also being present) andthey agree with this paper. We do not think that any useful purpose would be served by having any further inquiry. None the less we should recognise this may be along siege. A lot of fair-minded people are worried that 11 people could be beatento death and no one prosecuted, or brought to book (save perhaps as a result of the disciplinary proceedings against the two prison officials) and no Government held responsible.25. I seek the endorsement, of the Cabinet both of the action taken and of thegeneral lines put forward to meet the attack ofthe Opposition if it comes.
SECRETr;.,&apos;. .5Annex IREASONS OF THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL OF KENYA FOR his decision NOT TO PROSECUTEFollowing the; conclusion of the inquest proceedings, the Attorney-General, withhis advisers, gaVe careful consideration to the question whether or not the available evidence warranted the preferment of criminal charges against any person or persons.2. All the witnesses from whom statements were obtained by the CriminalInvestigation Department in its full and thorough investigation were made available at the inquest. In the absence of identifying witnesses, identification parades couldnot be held. No further or other evidence is available to sustain any criminal proceedings.3. The Attorney-General was satisfied that the evidence available established that the deaths of the 11 deceased detainees resulted from the use of force and thatthe greater part of the force used was illegal force. He concluded, however, thatthe evidence was insufficient to warrant the framing of any criminal charges inrespect of the causing of death or injury to the detainees, or in respect of the ordersgiven regarding the use of force in the operation or in respect of a combination orconspiracy to use illegal force.4. Much of the evidence was patently unreliable, but even if the question ofcredibility were disregarded and the evidence were taken at its face value, it was inadequate, particularly in regard to identification, to sustain criminal charges.5. The detainees had refused to co-operate in the Criminal InvestigationDepartment investigation or to identify warder staff or even to identify the bodies of the dead detainees (which had, therefore, to be identified by fingerprints). Somewere eventually persuaded to testify at the inquest but their evidence was dismissedby the Magistrate as valueless. v6. In any criminal proceedings the onus of proof lies on the Crown, thestandard of proof required being that beyond a reasonable doubt. That onus has tobe discharged in respect of both the commission of the alleged offence and the identity of the alleged offender. In any such proceedings in this case the evidenceof the detainees would be worthless, and the evidence of any members of the Prisonstaff who were present when violence was used and who were not accused would atleast be suspect and possibly, in some cases, of the nature of accomplice evidence which would require to be adequately corroborated in a sense connecting the accusedwith the commission of the offence.7. It is impossible, as the Magistrate found, to distinguish, on the evidence,which part of the force used was illegal force and which part was justified, or to separate the one from the other in terms of time, injuries caused and identities ofpersons involved, whether in the application or in the receipt of force.8. Such limited independent evidence as was available was inconclusive, and did not afford the means of identification of individuals with the culpable use of force, even in respect of the minor offence of common assault or abetment ofcommon assault. Only two independent witnesses testified to having seen, from a distance of 100 yards and more, assaults on detainees which, as described, appearto have been unlawful, but, understandably, neither was able to identify theassailants. One of these two witnesses referred to the presence of the Commandant,but was unable to say what he was doing.9. Section 18 of the Prisons Ordinance authorises the use of weapons, where necessary, by prison officers against detainees escaping or attempting to escape,engaged in a combined outbreak or using violence to any prison officer or other person. Prison Standing Orders forbid the striking by prison officers of persons in custody save to the extent necessary in defence or to overcome violence orresistance to escort. The Emergency (Detained Persons) Regulations, 1954,prescribe the circumstances and manner in which corporal punishment may beapplied to detainees for offences against discipline.
Annex IIDISCIPLINARY CHARGES PREFERRED AGAINST SULLIVANAND COUTTSAgainst Sullivan(i) That you being a Superintendent in the Kenya Prison Service on 3rd March, 1959, at hold in the Coast Province, acted with gross dereliction inthe performance of your duties as Officer in Charge of hold Special Detention Campin that you (a) put to work 85 non-co-operative detainees from the said camp in such away that you were unable to exercise proper control over the saiddetainees and in a manner contrary to instructions given you by SeniorSuperintendent. Cowan;(b) failed adequately to supervise the members of the said Service under yourorders in charge of the said detainees;(c) failed to prevent members of the said Service under, your orders fromimproper assault in your presence of some or all of the said detainees.(ii) That you being a Superintendent in the Kenya Prison Service on 4th March, 1959, at hold in the Coast Province acted with gross dereliction in the performance of your duties as Officer in Charge of hold Special Detention Camp,in that you gave misleading information concerning the events which had occurred at the said camp on the morning of 3rd March, 1959, to the then Acting DeputyCommissioner of Prisons, Mr. W. M. Campbell, and to the Under-Secretary ofDefence, Mr. A. C. Small.Against Coutts(i) That you being an Assistant Superintendent in the Kenya Prison service on 3rd March, 1959, at hold in the Coast Province acted with gross dereliction inthe performance of your duties when in charge of a working party of 85non-co-operative detainees from the hold Special Detention Cariip, in that youfailed to prevent members of the said Service under your orders from unlawfullyassaulting in your presence some or all of the said detainees, and(ii) that you being an Assistant Superintendent in the Kenya Prison &quot;service on 4th March,&apos; 1959, at hold in the Coast Province acted with gross dereliction inthe performance of your duties in that you gave misleading information concerningthe events which had occurred at hold on the morning of 3rd March, 1959, to the then Acting Deputy Commissioner of Prisons, Mr. W. M. Campbell, and to the under-Secretary of Defence, Mr. A. C. Small. -10. The evidence at the inquest does not establish that in the planning of theoperation the use of illegal force was contemplated. The document described atthe inquest as the &quot; Cowan plan &quot; was a report submitted to the Commissioner ofPrisons by Senior Superintendent Cowan.,after his visit to hold for the planning of the operation; no copy of that document was ever in the possession of thosewho carried out the. operation.   .;;      ; .11. The evidence also established that orders given to the warder staffregarding the use of force, which were given in Swahili, in no way established any intention to authorise the use of illegal force or any contemplation that illegal force would be used. They would not, therefore, sustain a prosecution in that respect.12. While the public interest Clearly requires that any person or persons who can be proved to have been criminally, implicated in such a shocking and tragicoccurrence should be brought to justice, it requires no less that no person should,in this or any other case, be placed in jeopardy on a criminal charge unless there is available sufficient evidence which, if believed, would establish his guilt. In this case the Attorney-General decided that the available evidence was insufficient forthis purpose, and he accordingly decided that no prosecutions should be instituted.
Annex IIIACTION TAKEN IN CASES OF ALLEGED BRUTALITY IN:, KENYA PRISONSNovember 1956Mr. L. W. Lemon: Lemon, Commandant of Mara River Detention Camp,was tried on 7th November, 1956, on two charges of occasioning actual bodilyharm to two detainees. He was found not guilty of causing actual bodily harm,but guilty of the lesser offence of common assault, and sentenced to be finedSh.500 or three months&apos; imprisonment in default. Subsequently disciplinary action against Lemon was taken under Colonial Regulations and his probationaryappointment of Assistant Superintendent of Prisons was terminated.December 1956Warder Magure Nyasobe: Magure was alleged to have kicked a remandprisoner in Machakos Prison in December 1956. The Attorney-General directed that disciplinary action should be taken against him, and it was. (N.B.-What it wasis unknown, but he was probably dismissed.)Mr. R. D. Rowe, Mr. C. A. Hirst, Jasiel Njau Kariuki (and severaldetainees): Jasiel Njau, an African Assistant Rehabilitation Officer of GathigiririWorks Camp, was tried in July 1957 for the murder of detainee Macheri Githumain January 1957. He was acquitted on the charge of murder, but was convicted of assault causing actual bodily harm and sentenced to twelve months&apos;imprisonment with hard labour.The Attorney-General decided that the evidence did not justify prosecution of Rowe, the Prison Officer in charge of the camp, or Hirst, who was in chargeof rehabilitation and Njau&apos;s superior officer. Rowe and Hirst were howevercharged with specific disciplinary offences principally that Rowe failed to makehimself familiar with conditions in the camp (including the assaulting andmaltreatment of detainees), and that Hirst was aware of malpractices but neithertried to stop them nor reported them to high authority.The disciplinary committee found that the charges against Rowe were notestablished. The committee considered, however, that the charges against Hirstwere established and that, despite extenuating circumstances, his retention in thepublic service was no longer justified. His appointment was accordinglyterminated with effect from 10th April, 1958.October 1957Mr. C. R. Harrison and two other European officers: These officers werealleged to have beaten detainees to make them work; were prosecuted on thecharge of causing actual bodily harm.  They were acquitted.September 1958 r     \ - X,- Wi^v6fvX(XMr: D.D. Luiesand two African screeners /-On 15th September, 1958, whilstin charge of Gathigiriri Camp, Luies absented himself without have a responsibleEuropean officer to take charge of the Camp in his absence, contrary to.standing orders. His absence from the Camp was on official duty, but while he was awayan incident occurred as a result.of which one of the detainees (Kibebe Macharia)subsequently died. The two African interrogators were acquitted of the murder of Kibebe Macharia, but found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to threeyears&apos; imprisonment.   A disciplinary enquiry found that Luies&apos; absence was, onJuly 1957
duty which, while not immediate, was pressing, and had no bearing on anyill-treatment received by Kibebe Macharia. In these circumstances it was decidedthat a reprimand would meet the case, and this was approved.January 1959      ................................ ...........Samuel Mugo Githu, G.M.: Githu, a District Assistant employed onrehabilitation at Aguthi Camp, was tried and convicted on three counts of assaultcausing actual bodily harm (one referred to Kabugi Njuma, who afterwards died).He was sentenced to two years&apos; imprisonment.June 1959.
