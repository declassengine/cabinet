secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;^ GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1959Cjf. (59) $816th March, 1959.Copy No.CABINETNYASALAND EMERGENCYMemorandum by Secretary of State for the ColoniesSince our discussion on 11th March (C.C (59) 16th Conclusions, Minute 3)I have been in consultation with some of my colleagues, and the commonwealth secretary and I have been in touch with Sir Roy Welensky, Prime Minister of theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and the Governors of the two northern territories respectively about the proposal to publish a White Paper on the nyasaland emergency and the proposal for an enquiry into that emergency.2. We all think that an enquiry is necessary. A local enquiry, thoughpreferable from certain points of view, would not satisfy public opinion here.The Governor of Nyasaland was at first inclined to favour a ParliamentaryCommission owing to the political nature of some of the issues involved but would I think now be disposed to agree that a non-political form of enquiry intothe Nyasaland emergency is preferable provided that there is no unnecessarydelay in proceeding with some form of political fact-finding on the issues affectingthe future of the Federation.3. The Secretary and I are now both convinced that an enquiry by acommission rather on the lines of the Indian Statutory Commission will benecessary before we can go into any conference on the future of the Federation.It will however take some time to work out this proposal in all its aspects, obtainthe agreement or acquiescence of the Federal Government and mount it. Wehave therefore abandoned an idea which had occurred to me that the Nyasalandemergency might be dealt with in an interim report by a commission of this kind.At the same time it seems very important that the suspicions of Federation heldby the majority of Nyasaland Africans, which are bound to be revealed by an enquiry into the Nyasaland emergency, though they are one of the factors whichmust affect consideration of the future of the Federation, should not come to beregarded as the only such factor. We have accordingly come to the view thatthe Commission of Enquiry into the Nyasaland emergency should be a separatecommission but that at the same time as we announce it, or as soon as possible thereafter, we should also announce our intention to appoint a wider commissionto look into the working of Federation and to make recommendations for its future.4. For the Nyasaland commission I am now thinking in terms of a commission which would not carry out a judicial enquiry in the technical sense of that termbut which would have as its chairman a judge from this country; there might be two other members of the commission one of whom might be an ex-Colonial Governor.The commission should include someone (whether chairman or member) who would command respect in Scotland where there is such a deep interest in the affairs of nyasaland. I have had some preliminary discussion of personalities with the LordChancellor and with the Commonwealth Secretary and will have some suggestions to put forward when we discuss this matter in Cabinet.54914
5. It is important that the terms of reference of the Nyasaland enquiry shouldbe such as to encourage the proposed commission to restrict its report to the facts.I accordingly propose the following terms of reference:  &quot; To enquire into the recent disturbances in Nyasaland and the eventsleading up to them and to report thereon.&quot;6. It is possible that the Federal Government may make difficulties about theproposal that we should announce in the near future our intention to appoint the wider commission referred to above. The Commonwealth Secretary is in communication with Sir Roy Welensky about this and hopes, to have his firstreaction before tomorrow^ Cabinet. I also hope by then to be in possession of thelatest views of the Governor of Nyasalancl, of the Minister of State for colonial affairs who is with him and of the Governor of Northern Rhodesia.7. Following our last discussions I arranged for the preparation inmy Department of the first draft of a White Paper on the events leading up to the nyasaland emergency; and a copy of this draft reached Nyasaland to-day.Meanwhile the Governor of Nyasaland has suggested that our White Paper shouldtake the form of a despatch from him and the draft of such a despatch which hehas prepared also reached London to-day.8. If our White Paper takes the form of a despatch from the Governor of nyasaland I think it will be less likely to be misinterpreted as an attempt to prejudice the findings of the proposed Nyasaland commission. I accordingly consider thatour White Paper should take this form and I will circulate a draft to my colleagues as soon as I have had time to examine the Governor^ draft and to compare it withthe draft White Paper which had been prepared in my Department.9.   To sum up I ask my colleagues to agree (a) That a Commission of Enquiry into the Nyasaland emergency should beappointed with membership and terms of reference on lines suggested inparagraphs 4 and 5. -       .  -(b) That if Sir Roy Welensky&apos;s reply is favourable we should announce our intention of appointing a wider commission, perhaps termed aPreparatory Commission, to look into the working of the federation and to make recommendations in regard to its future at the same time as, or as soon as possible after, our announcement of the enquiry intothe Nyasaland emergency.(c) That a despatch from the Governor of Nyasaland describing the eventsleading up to the declaration of the emergency in that territory shouldbe published as soon as possible.A. L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.1,16th&apos;March, 1959.
