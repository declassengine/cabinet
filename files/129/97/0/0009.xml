AGRICULTURE ACTS, 1947 AND 1957ANNUAL REVIEW AND DETERMINATION of guarantees, 1959I. introduction. The 1959 Annual Review of the economic condition and prospects of theagricultural industry has now been held in accordance with Section 2 of the agriculture Act, 1947. In the light of it, and of the long-term assurancesprovided for in the Agriculture Act, 1957, the Government have determined the guarantees for livestock and livestock products for the year April, 1959,to March, 1960, and for crops from the 1959 harvest. These are set out inAppendix V.n. Economic Condition of the Agricultural industry the Course of Production2. Agricultural net output is being maintained at the high level reachedduring the two preceding years. For 1958/59 it is forecast at 61 per cent above pre-war-war. This is the same as the figure for 1956/57 and one point below the revised figure of 62 per cent for 1957/58. But for the bad weather net output in 1958/59 would probably have shown a slight increase on last year&apos;s recordfigure.3. The total arable area was maintained in 1958; there was virtually nochange in the total acreage of either tillage crops or temporary grass. Cerealand potato crop yields have been lower than they would have been given normal weather, though total production of cereals is estimated to be slightly higherthan in 1957/58, when yields were also below normal. Production of milk has fallen, mainly because of lower yields. Production of beef and lamb has alsofallen temporarily, but there has been a continued increase in the number ofcalves retained for beef and in the sheep breeding flock. Production ofpigmeat has increased, but the pig breeding herd has been declining. Therehas been a further substantial increase in production of eggs.Changes in Income4. Actual net income is forecast to have fallen as compared with last year.The forecast for 1958/59 is  327 million: the revised figure for 1957/58 is 354^ million: the figure for 1956/57 was  319J million. The fall of  27^million this year is due to the weather and in particular to its effect on the feedbill for milk production. When adjusted for normal weather conditions, net income is forecast to show an increase over last year  360^ million as corn-pared with a revised figure of  355 million for 1957/58 and with  339 million in 1956/57. This confirms the Governmenfs assessment last year that the trend of net income, on a normal weather basis, was a rising one.Efficiency5. The effects of the increasing efficiency of the industry have in recent years been assessed broadly at something like  25 miUion a year for review com-modities. In the Governmenfs view efficiency is continuing to increase on this scale, although in the current year the effects have in part been masked by he had  weather.Changes in Costs6. There has been a further net increase, during the past year in the prices, ofgoods and services used in agriculture, but the only large item is the increase in wages.   The.net increase for review commodities is about  11-j million, after331836 A 2
excluding feed costs for pigs and eggs which are reflected automatically inadjustments to the guarantees for those commodities. This is about the sameas the net increase last year.III. Production and Guarantee Policies7. Production and guarantee policies have been reviewed in the light of developments during the past year and of the prospects for the industry andfor the nation.8. Satisfactory features of the recent course of production are the approximatemaintenance of the arable acreage, with a wheat acreage less than in 1956/57;the continued increase in breeding and rearing of beef animals; thereduction in the supply of milk surplus to liquid requirements, especially in sofar as this is due to an increase in liquid milk consumption and to a switchfrom milk to beef; and the decline in the pig breeding herd from an excessivelevel, indicating that some of the high-cost production, with its demands for imported feedingstuffs, is being eliminated. The trend of production of sheepis still upwards but any further expansion of production will need to beconsidered in the light of market prospects, including the expectation of more plentiful supplies from Australia and New Zealand. Features of particularconcern are the further rise in imports of feedingstuffs, from 5-4 million tonscosting nearly  120 million in 1957/58 to 6 -1 million tons which may cost about 140 million in 1958/59, though this is partly due to the effects of the weather;and the continued increase in egg production despite the reductions in pricedetermined after the last two annual reviews which were intended to check theexpansion of production.Production Policy9. The general policy objectives stated in the 1958 Annual Review white paper (Cmnd. 390) remain unchanged. The aim must still be a steadyimprovement in the competitive position of the industry, and in its adaptationto the needs of the market. On present prospects no further expansion of grossoutput is required. Any further expansion of net output, if it is to be of real value, must be achieved through reducing unit costs by means of improvedtechniques and better farm management. The importance that the Govern-ment attach to better management of the farm as a whole has been emphasisedduring the past year in the new measures of special assistance for small farmers.Commodity Objectives10. Within these general objectives the particular aims should be as follows: (i) maintenance of the arable acreage at roughly its present size, but with less emphasis on wheat and rye than on barley and other feed crops;(ii) greater reliance on home-grown feed for livestock;(iii) production of more beef of the quality wanted by the market;(iv) for lamb the primary aim in view of market prospects is to get downcosts;(v) continued reduction in the costs of production of pigmeat, and further effort to satisfy market requirements;(vi) production of less eggs, and of less milk than is at present in prospect.Cost of Agricultural Support11. There has been a welcome reduction in the cost to the Exchequer of thesupport to agriculture. The total for 1958/59 is estimated at about  248million, as compared with  284 million last year.   This fall in cost is due
mainly to higher market prices but also to the reductions in the guaranteesdetermined after the 1958 Annual Review. At the present level of cost,however, the support to agriculture is still a heavy burden on the taxpayer:12. The level of agricultural support also affects relations and trade with commonwealth and other traditional food-exporting countries. There is increasing concern about the effects on international trade of the agriculturalprotection that is provided in nearly all countries.IV. Long-Term Assurances13. The Agriculture Act, 1957, requires the Government to make determina-tions after each annual review such as to maintain the total value of the guarantees at not less than 97  per cent of their total value in the preceding year, after allowing for cost changes that have occurred on review commoditiessince the last annual review. In addition the guaranteed price for eachcommodity must be maintained at not less than 96 per cent of that determinedafter the preceding annual review.14. The total value of the guarantees (including relevant production grants)for this purpose at the 1959 Annual Review was calculated to be  1,228 million,and 97^ per cent of this is  1,197 million. After the addition of the relevantcost increase of about  Hi million, the lower limit for the Governmenfsdetermination is a reduction of about  19 million in the total value of the guarantees.V. Governmenfs Conclusions15. The inflationary pressures in the national economy have been reduced inthe past year. The cost to the Exchequer of support for agriculture, althoughstill high, has fallen. On the other hand, the wider interests of the national economy and of international relations, especially with the Commonwealth,require that the industry&apos;s dependence on support should be kept as low aspossible.16. There is still a tendency for over-production of some commodities.There is a general need to keep down costs and to improve returns from themarket by meeting the requirements of the consumer. The industry is con-tinuing to do this successfully. Together with the Exchequer support for theindustry this is one of the main reasons for the upward trend in net income,on a normal weather basis.17. But this upward trend has been masked in part by adverse weather conditions. The actual financial strength of the industry at the present time,therefore, is not as great as it would otherwise have been. Although farmersexpect to bear the risks of the weather, the Government think it right on this occasion to take account of the fact that during the last five years adverse weather conditions have substantially outweighed favourable conditions. Theindustry&apos;s actual net income in that period has been on average between fourand five per cent below what it would have been under normal weather conditions.18. On a balance of these considerations the Government have concluded that there should this year be a small net increase in the total value of the guarantees. - :&apos;.riVI. Determination of Guarantees19. The determinations to be made were those for livestock and livestock products for the year April, 1959, to March, 1960, and those for crops of the1959 harvest. The determinations for.the particular commodities are set outin. Appendix V.   The main features are as follows.- i31836 A 3
Milk20. Production of milk has fallen by about 5 per cent, due mainly to theeffects of the weather on milk yields but also to a reduction in the milking herd.After the temporary fall in 1958/59 the trend in production is likely to beupward in 1959/60, given normal weather, even if there is some further reductionin the size of the milking herd. Production, even at this year&apos;s level however,is still above what is needed for the liquid milk market, after allowing for aliberal reserve. Reductions in the quantities that can only be used for manu-facture into milk products are to be welcomed. In general the production of milk beyond what is necessary for the liquid milk market is not economic atanything like present costs of production and reduces the average return per gallon to producers. The Government have concluded that, despite the fall in production, no increase in the guaranteed price would be justified and that theprice should be left unchanged.21. The industry will need to continue its strenuous efforts to encourageliquid milk consumption. There has been a net increase in sales for liquidconsumption in England and Wales since marketing powers were restored tothe Milk Marketing Board in 1954, and a substantial increase in the last year.In consideration of this, the Government have decided that the standard quantity for England and Wales for 1959/60 should be increased by 7 million gallons. The decision is without prejudice to the more general considerationof the policy to be adopted in future for making alterations in the standard quantities for the various milk marketing areas in the United Kingdom. this raises important issues which the Government have agreed to discuss further with representatives of the producers before the next annual review.Eggs22. After the 1957 Annual Review and again last year the guaranteed price for eggs was reduced with the object of stopping the expansion of production.Despite this there has been a substantial increase in production in 1958/59 anda further increase is in prospect for 1959/60. The guaranteed price is muchabove the market price and subsidy expenditure, although reduced this year, isstill as high as one-third of the market value. It has therefore been decided toreduce further the guaranteed price for hen eggs by Id. per dozen.Fat Cattle23. Output of beef has fallen temporarily, but the number of calves retained for beef continues to rise and a renewed expansion of output is expected in1959/60. There is still room for increasing home production of beef. Theincrease in calf retentions and the strong demand for store cattle indicate that,at the present guaranteed price for fat cattle, beef production is generallyprofitable and the Government have decided that the guaranteed price shouldbe left unchanged. In order to provide further encouragement to the rearingof beef store cattle, however, the rate of hill cow subsidy will be increased by 2 to  12 a head for the year 1959; and the rate of calf subsidy will be in-creased by 15s. Od. to  9 5s. Od. a head in respect of steer calves born on or after 1st April, 1959.24. Although the Government consider that emphasis should continue to beplaced on quality production, they have accepted the view of the Farmers&apos;Unions that the present differential of 8s. Od. per live cwt. in favour of Grade if at cattle under the guarantee arrangements may tend to discourage continued expansion in the production of beef from the dairy herd; It has therefore beendecided that, with effect from 29th June, 1959, the differential should be reducedto 5s. Od. per live cwt. The maximum weight for Grade I steers will beincreased from 11 cwt. to 1.1$ cwt. as from the start of the 1959/60 guaranteeyear.
Fat Pigs25. At the 1958 Annual Review the Governmenfs aim as regards fat pigswas to reverse the trend of output, which was increasing, and the guaranteed price was therefore reduced. Output of pigmeat has increased in 1958/59, butthe breeding herd has declined and output in 1959/60 is expected to be at aboutthe level of 1957/58. In these circumstances, although the cost to the exchequer is still high, no further reduction has been made in the guaranteed price forfat pigs.26. Continued improvement in quality standards is of vital importance to theentire pig industry. The Government recognise that this has been encouraged by the quality premiums on pigs sold by grade and deadweight at baconfactories. But the present arrangements are not in all respects satisfactory.In particular, the premiums are financed from within the guarantee for all pigsso that a large part of their cost has fallen on producers of other types of pigsfor which it has not been possible to introduce similar premiums. The Govern-ment have decided, therefore, to reduce the quality premiums by 6d. per score.This will not affect the value of the guarantee to pig producers as a whole. Atthe same time the guarantee arrangements will be modified so as to ensuregreater stability of returns for all types of producers. Details of the revised arrangements are given in Appendix V. The Government also intend to invitethe Pig Industry Development Authority, in consultation with representativesof the interests concerned in Northern Ireland, to advise on the whole questionof quality standards for pigs.Fat Sheep27. No change is being made in the guaranteed price for fat sheep, but themaximum weights in respect of which guarantee payments may be made are tobe reduced. The Government propose to examine, in consultation with therepresentatives of producers before the 1960 Annual Review, the possibility ofproviding within the guarantee arrangements some further encouragement tothe marketing of fat sheep and lambs at lighter weights.Wool28. The Governmenfs policy, as stated in the 1956 Annual Review white paper (Cmd. 9721), is that taking one year with another the wool guarantee should not require continuing Exchequer payments. The guaranteed price has remained above the market price since the first year of the present guarantee arrangements, and the present prospect is of continuing subsidy. world prices are considerably lower than a year ago, and the Exchequer cost has risensharply. The Government have therefore decided to reduce the guaranteed price by 2d. per lb.Crops29. The subsidy on wheat is still high in relation to market value and worldwheat surpluses are increasing. Wheat is less useful for animal feeding thanbarley and other grain crops. A reduction of 6d. per cwt. is therefore beingmade in the guaranteed price for wheat. A reduction of 6d. per cwt. is also being made in the guaranteed price for rye.30. The guaranteed prices for barley, oats and sugar beet have been leftunchanged.31. As already announced, the Government have decided to introduce anew guarantee system for potatoes for the 1959 crop which substitutes for thepurchase of surplus potatoes on Government account arrangements thatassure a minimum return to the industry as a whole related to the requirements
of potatoes for human consumption. The Government have agreed with therepresentatives of producers that a guaranteed price of  12 14s. Od. per tonunder the new guarantee system is equivalent to the support price determinedat the 1958 Annual Review under the present system. The acreage expectedto be planted for the 1959 crop should, with normal yields, give a sizeablesurplus. No further encouragement to the growing of potatoes is required.Accordingly, it has been decided that for potatoes sold for human consumptionfrom the 1959 crop the price guaranteed to the industry as a whole should be 12 14s. Od. per ton. Details of the new system have been worked outwith the co-operation of the producers&apos; representatives and are set out inAppendix V.Production Grants32. The implementation of the Government&apos;s proposals in the White paper on Assistance for Small Farmers (Cmnd. 553) has been taken into account inthe Annual Review determination. It involves a net increase in the total valueof the guarantees of  6 million, being the estimated net cost in the first full year of operation of the new schemes. The Government have reviewed theother relevant production grants and have decided to increase the rates of subsidy for steers calves and hill cows as indicated in paragraph 23 above.VIL Effect of Determinations33. The determinations now made result in a net increase of  3 million in thetotal value of the guarantees. They provide for the cost of the new assistanceschemes for small farmers and for some reduction in the level of the guarantee for those commodities where this is most required at the present time. Theindustry will accordingly be able to retain most of the value of its increasing efficiency. At the same time the new assistance schemes will make it possiblefor many small farmers to start on plans for improving the profitability oftheir farm businesses. The net income of the industry as a whole is affectedby many factors apart from the level of the guarantees. But the Governmentare satisfied that these determinations should enable the industry to maintain a fair and reasonable level of remuneration in accordance with the agriculture act, 1947.

(not yet available)Note (i). The estimates of aggregate farming net income in Tables A and B arearrived at after making provision for depreciation. Net income can be defined asthe reward for the manual and managerial labour of the farmer and his wife, and forthe use of the occupier&apos;s investment.Note (ii). These two series of aggregate farming net income are calculated in fundamentally different ways. The &quot; Departmental &quot; estimate is built up fromstatistics of income and expenditure for the whole &quot; national&quot; farm, whereas the&quot; raised sample &quot; is based on some 3,600 actual farm accounts, which are expanded or &quot; raised &quot; to give an aggregate for all farms in the United Kingdom. There area number of reasons why the levels of aggregate net income shown in these two series should vary but it is difficult to make a quantitative assessment of the individualcauses. Both series are of value in indicating the general trend in the level of income.
Note (iii). The figures for aggregate.net income in Table A include as profit inrecent years about  11 million on the production of food for consumption in the farm household. In other industries the corresponding sums are not treated asprofit and are relatively much smaller (in many cases non-existent).Note (iv). From the figures for aggregate net income given in Table A certainsums should have been appropriated by farmers to cover the excess of replacement cost over original cost of certain assets (slaughter stock, cultivations, growing crops,etc.) used up in the course of the year&apos;s production and trade.

Because themarketings of fatstock and wheat cannot be accurately forecast, producers&apos; averagereturns under the guarantees for those products in any year may be a little more orless than the guaranteed prices. The prices guaranteed to the British Egg MarketingBoard for hen and duck eggs are subject to a profit and loss sharing arrangement inaccordance with the terms of a financial agreement between the Government and theBoard. .       - .. .;      -
Part II.  Additional Details of GuaranteesFatstock1. The guaranteed prices for fat cattle, fat sheep and lambs and fat pigs for 1959/60are on the basis of a deficiency payments scheme similar to that in operation for1958/59, except as stated in the following paragraphs.2. With effect from 30th March, 1959, the maximum weight for steers (other thanthose which have grown not more than two broad teeth and have retained six calfteeth) that may qualify as Grade I for the higher rate of guarantee payment will beincreased from 11 cwt. to 114 cwt. liveweight (from 720 lbs. to 750 lbs. deadweight).With effect from 29th June, 1959, the present differential of 8s. Od. per live cwt.between the rates of guarantee payments for the two Grades will be reduced to5s. Od. per live cwt. In the period 30th March to 28th June, 1959, therefore, the differential will be applied by increasing the average rate of guarantee for home-bredstock by 3s. 3d. per live cwt. for Grade I and reducing the average rate by 4s. 9d. perlive cwt. for Grade II; after 28th June, 1959, the increase for Grade I will be2s. Od. per live cwt. and the reduction for Grade II will be 3s. Od. per live cwt.If, however, in respect of any week the average rate of guarantee payment is lessthan the specified reduction for Grade II, there will be no guarantee payment forGrade II and the rates for Grade I will be as follows:Home-bred StockCalculated average Rate of guaranteerate of guarantee payment for Grade Iper live cwt.4s. 6d.l4s.

As in previous years, there will be no upper limit to the weight at which livesheep or their carcases may be certified, but with effect from 29th June, 1959, themaximum weights in respect of which guarantee payments may be made will bereduced as follows:Dressed Carcase Weight*30th March, 1959to On and after28th June, 1959 29th June, 1959Lambs    ...........      ... 70 1b. 60 lb.Hoggets.........      ... 761b. 701b.Other clean sheep       ...... 86 lb. 80 lb.(* In the case of liveweight certification estimated d.c.w. In the case of dead-weight certification-actual d.c.w.)4. The fatstock guarantee scheme for 1959/60 will provide for stabilising arrange-ments similar to those operative in 1958/59. For the purposes of the guarantee for pigs, however, the average return to producers will be calculated separately for:(i) pigs sold to bacon curers by grade and deadweight and certified at approvedbacon factories;.     (ii) other eligible pigs.The provisional rate of guarantee for pigs, which will be calculated and announcedeach week as at present for all eligible stock, will be subject to adjustment in respectof either or both of the descriptions (i) and (ii) above in any week in which this isnecessary to secure that the average returns (calculated to the nearest Id. per scoredeadweight) on each of the two descriptions do not differ from the standard price bymore than 3s. Od. per score deadweight.7s.	6d.l6s.	9d. Ua)5s,	9d.J5s.	Od.4s.	3d..3s.	3d.2s.	6d.Is.	9d. 9d.
5. The guarantee arrangements for pigs for 1959/60 will provide for two rates of quality premium under broadly the same conditions as in 1958/59. The existing rates of quality premium will, however, be reduced by 6d. per score to 3s. Od. and2s. Od. per score deadweight respectively. As in previous years, the quality premiumswill be financed out of the guarantee for all pigs. Accordingly the rates of premiumspecified above may be reduced, or may not be paid, in respect of any week for whichthe average market price for the purpose of calculating the provisional rate of guarantee exceeds the guaranteed price, after taking account of any feed adjustment.6. The guarantee price for pigs shown in col. (iii) of Table A is related to a priceof 28s. 3d. per cwt. for the prescribed basic ration of feedingstuffs. As in previous years, the rates of guarantee payment in 1959/60 will take account of variations infeed prices as compared with the standard feed price.Eggs7. The guarantee for eggs in 1959/60 will be on substantially the same basis as in1958/59. Flat rates of subsidy will be calculated by subtracting from the guaranteed prices, shown in column (iii) of Table A of this Appendix, the estimated averageselling prices to be determined by Ministers on a similar basis to that adopted in1958/59. Such flat rates of subsidy will be payable to the British Egg MarketingBoard in accordance with the provisions of a financial agreement to be concludedbetween the Government and the Board.8. As in previous years, the guaranteed prices for eggs in 1959/60 will be subjectto adjustment in accordance with the operation of a feedingstuffs formula. For thispurpose the guaranteed prices for 1959/60 are related to a standard feed price of26s. 1 Id. per cwt.9. The guaranteed price to the Board for hen eggs qualifying for the guarantee inNorthern Ireland was subject to a small reduction in 1958/59 in order to recover from the industry certain costs incurred on a poultry progeny testing scheme in thatcountry. After the guarantee year 1958/59 the industry&apos;s contribution to such costs will be the subject of an agreement between the Government of Northern Irelandand the Board. Accordingly no reduction will be made on this account in the priceguaranteed to the Board for 1959/60.Wool10. The guaranteed price for 1959/60 will be an average price per lb. to be receivedby the British Wool Marketing Board for wool (other than skin wool) produced inthe United Kingdom and tendered to the Board during the twelve months commencing1st May, 1959. As in previous years, the guarantee will be implemented in accordancewith the provisions of the financial agreement concluded in November, 1955, betweenthe Government and the Board.. Milk11. The guarantee for milk in 1959/60 will be on the same basis as in 1958/59,except as stated in the following paragraph.12. As in previous years, the average guaranteed price for the United kingdom will be broken down into separate guaranteed prices for each of the five milk marketingscheme areas in the United Kingdom; and the guaranteed price for each area will again be related to a standard quantity of milk for that area. The standard quantity for England and Wales will be increased for 1959/60 from 1,654  million gallons to1,661-i million gallons; the standard quantities for the other areas for 1959/60 willbe the same as for 1958/59.13. For each area the guaranteed price will be broken down into a higher price for a primary proportion and a lower price for the remainder of the milk. Thehigher and lower prices will be specified later. The primary proportions in 1959/60will be the same as in 1958/59.Cereals14. The guaranteed prices for cereals for 1959/60 are on the basis of a deficiency round scheme similar to that in operation for 1958/59.31836
45Potatoes15. As already announced, a new system for implementing the guarantee forpotatoes will be introduced for the 1959 crop. If, in respect of any guarantee year(1st August to 31st July), the average market price for home-produced potatoes (otherthan new potatoes) for human consumption is less than- the guaranteed price, a deficiency payment will be made by the Government in respect of the tonnage ofhome-produced potatoes (other than new potatoes) estimated to have been sold for human consumption through the channels specified in paragraph 16 below. (Fromany crop, potatoes delivered before 1st August in the year of harvesting will bedeemed to be new potatoes.) Seven-eighths of the total deficiency payment for theUnited Kingdom in any year will be paid to the Potato Marketing Board in GreatBritain, in accordance with the terms of a financial agreement to be concluded betweenthe Government and the Board; one-eighth of the total deficiency payment will beput at the disposal of the Ministry of Agriculture in Northern Ireland (where thereis no such Board) for the benefit of growers in that country.16. For the purpose of paragraph 15 above, the tonnage of home-producedpotatoes (other than new potatoes) sold for human consumption will include thetonnage of:(a) In Great Britain(i) sales by growers (including licensed grower-salesmen) to licensedmerchants;(ii) sales by licensed grower-salesmen other than to licensed merchants;(iii) other sales by growers for human consumption specially licensed by theBoard.(Jb) In Northern IrelandSales by growers through wholesale channels and to persons buying forresale. Arrangements will be made to include any other growers&apos; sales ofa wholesale nature, e.g. to hospitals, public institutions, etc.The relevant tonnages will be calculated from returns by merchants and (in respectof certain sales) by growers and, where necessary, from information supplied by theBoard in respect of sales specially licensed. A deduction from the total tonnage socalculated will be made at the end of the season in respect of any potatoes for human consumption which may have been exported from the United Kingdom. Theprocedure for obtaining the necessary returns is being worked out in consultationwith representatives of producers and trade interests.17. As a transitional arrangement for the first year of the new system, i.e. for the1959/60 crop year only, the tonnage of potatoes sold as in paragraph 16 above willbe estimated to be 3,809 thousand tons.18. The average market price will be calculated from returns made by merchantsof the prices per ton paid to growers for potatoes purchased for human consumption.Prices will be taken on ex-farm or free on rail basis, the merchant providing sacks.19. Provision will be made under the new system for the continuation (with appropriate modifications) of the arrangements under which a transport subventionmay be paid by the Exchequer on shipments to Great Britain of potatoes grown inNorthern Ireland. For the time being arrangements will also be made, if that shouldbe necessary in a year of heavy surplus, to process potatoes in factories in NorthernIreland. In that event the difference between the purchase price of potatoes forprocessing and the price realised for the processed product will be met from theNorthern Ireland share of the total deficiency payment.Sugar Beet20. As in previous years, the guaranteed price shown in column (iii) of Table b of this Appendix is related to beet of 16-5 per cent sugar content. The pricedifferential, plus or minus for each one per cent sugar content, will continue to be7s. 6d. per ton.
21. The guarantee will continue to apply to the produce of the acreage contractedfor by the British Sugar Corporation, in agreement with the Government: and forthe 1959 harvest, as in recent years, this acreage will not exceed 400,000 acres inEngland and Wales and 14,600 acres in Scotland.22. In England and Wales the British Sugar Corporation will bear rail transport costs, for delivery to factories of sugar beet from the 1959 crop, in excess of suchsum as may be declared by the Corporation on 1st September, 1959, to represent theaverage cost per ton of sugar beet of rail freight for 40 miles; but, as in 1958/59, theCorporation will bear no part of the cost of transporting sugar beet by road. As in previous years, to take account of the transport terms in the Corporation^ contract for the purchase of sugar beet for processing at its Scottish factory, the price onwhich this contract will be based will be Is. 9d. per ton less than the guaranteed price.(31836)   Wt. 1360-4231   K62   3/59   D.L.
