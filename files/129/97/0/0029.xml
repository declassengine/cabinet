SECRETIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1959C. (59) 791st May, 1959CABINETAIRCRAFT INDUSTRY: REPLACEMENT OF THE DAKOTAMemorandum by the Prime minister a difference of opinion has arisen about proposals to grant government financial support to the production of a British aircraft which we would hope to export in substantial numbers to replace the obsolescent Dakota. The problem has been considered by the Committee on Civil Aviation Policy; and as thedifference still remains it is necessary for it to be considered by the Cabinet.2. The details and the arguments bearing on this problem are set out fully in papers of the Civil Aviation Policy Committee which have been sent to all members of the Cabinet (C.A. (59) 6th Meeting Minutes and C.A. (59) 23).3.   In brief summary, the issues which arise seem to me to be as follows:  (i) The Government a year ago announced their future policy on the aircraft industry. This was broadly that in the changed circumstances facingit i.e., the reduced defence requirements the industry shouldreorganise and contract itself; and Government financial supportshould pay regard to the need for this and should be directed in thefirst place to research and in the second place to the development ofnew types of aircraft embodying major technical innovations andinvolving special commercial risks. Would it be right to adhere to thispolicy, or should exceptions be made? Any support for a Dakotareplacement would involve a departure from this policy and might beregarded as a precedent for other similar ventures such as the Viscountreplacement. It is true that the Committee on Civil Aviation policy have already decided in principle that such a departure in the case ofthe Dakota would be advisable, but it will be seen from Annex II toC.A. (59) 23 that the Minister of Supply now feels real doubt whetherthis would be wise.Copy No. 5 2
SECRET(ii) If, notwithstanding this, the Cabinet should decide to endorse the decisionof principle of the Civil Aviation Policy Committee, the next questionis whether or not this support should be given to more than one aircraft.The arguments for and against supporting both the Herald and theAvro 748 are set out in the papers to which I refer. If we decide tosupport one only, should the decision go in favour of the Herald, onthe grounds inter alia that it is the one now flying? Or shouldpreference be given to the Avro 748 both on the grounds that it is more likely to obtain a substantial order which the Indian government intend to place and because its manufacturers, the Hawker Siddeleygroup, are more likely to have a long-term future in the aircraft industry than the Handley Page Company, who make the Herald? Thepossibility of a substantial Indian order is undoubtedly a special factor.But is it, or is it not, of such overriding importance that government support should be linked specifically to the aircraft which secures it?4.   We ought to try to reach an early decision on this.H. M.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1.1st May, 1959.
