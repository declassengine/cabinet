confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1959C. (59) 659th April, 1959Copy No.      57CABINETINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the- exchequer the Cabinet asked me to arrange for a further study to be made of theadvantages and disadvantages of United Kingdom membership of the proposed international Development Association (I.D.A.) on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister at an earlier discussion of this matter on 17th March, 1959 (C.C (59) 17thConclusions, Minute 5). The points which I have had examined, and the resultsof the examination are as follows A. Whether the United Kingdom&apos;s membership of the proposed association would prejudice our ability to discharge our existing obligations.2. It was made clear in C. (59) 50 that on the most optimistic assumptions anew International Development Association could not be operating until 1960 andthat it could hardly hope to spend an initial capital contribution of $2,000 millions( 715 millions) in less than three to five years. Thus the United kingdom contribution of  100 millions would involve additional external investment at therate of some  20 millions- 30 millions a year from 1960. There would be no additional commitment in 1959. If the initial capital were to be less the UnitedKingdom&apos;s contribution would also be less. The Secretary of the United states treasury, Mr. Anderson, told the Prime Minister recently in Washington that hewas thinking of an initial capital of $h000 millions ( 357 millions). The state department on the other hand appear to be thinking of a figure of $2,000 millions( 715 millions). The latter figure appears in fact to be a more realistic estimate,given the magnitude of the problem. If the lower figure were adopted it is probablethat the Fund would as a result need to be replenished sooner. Given that theUnited Kingdom hopes to gain in exports more than the amount of its subscription,our own interest would be on the side of choosing the larger figure. There might also be a better chance of securing a substantial United States contribution by asingle approach to Congress. If, however, further discussion with the Americansshows that agreement can more easily be reached on the basis of the smaller figure,the figures given in this paper should in each case be divided by two.3. Officials have recently been reviewing prospects for the United Kingdom&apos;external investment in 1959-62. It has been estimated that new lending by theGovernment and new London Market loans will together average  60 millions perannum. In addition, in the light of the commitments made during the MontrealConference, capital assistance may have to be provided to commonwealth governments on the scale of about  40 millions a year. If all the United Kingdom&apos;present and prospective capital commitments are to be met and the reserves are tobe rebuilt to the level at which they stood at the end of 1958, officials have concluded that a current surplus of the order of  450 millions per annum will be required forthe years 1960-62 (assuming a figure of  285 millions for 1959).55002CONFIDENTIAL
4. To achieve such a surplus is not an impossible task but it would dependboth on our avoiding inflation at home and on other countries following policiesconducive to the expansion of world trade. It would be most important that othercountries should expand their external investment in step with the United Kingdom.5. The great potential advantage of channelling loans or grants to under-developed countries through an international institution such as the proposed^International Development Association, to which the aggregate contributions ofother countries greatly exceed ounown, is that we ought to be able to gain exports from the contributions of other countries. Indeed, we ought to gain in additionalexports more than the amount of our own initial contribution, in which case thebalance of payments would be actively assisted.6. My conclusion is that we could afford this further capital commitmentprovided that our contribution is matched by adequate contributions from othercountries. At the same time we should take special care to ensure that thecontributions made by others are as far as possible additional to their existinglevels of external investment and are freely convertible.B. Whether we should seek to ensure that at least half the capital, of the association is contributed by countries other than the United States7. The proposal originally made by Senator Monroney was that I.D.A.subscriptions should be based on subscriptions to the International Bank for reconstruction and Development (I.B.R.D.). On this basis an initial capital of$2,000 millions for the I.D.A. would fall to be subscribed as follows:  	Per cent.	$ millionsUnited States       ..........	34	680United Kingdom......	14	280France	5-5	110Germany   ...	5-5	110India        ...      ...      ......	4-25	85Canada     ..........	3-75	75Japan       ...	3-5	70Netherlands         ......	3	60	73-5	1,470Sixty other countries between them	26-5	530Total .	.     100	2,0008. The Secretary of the United States Treasury sets much store by gettingevery country to make some contribution in convertible currencies, however small,but it is clearly not realistic to expect anything more than small amounts from the mass of under-developed countries. No doubt some of the Six (France, Germany,Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) will also claim that theirpreoccupations with the Common Market preclude them from putting up large sums.9. I very much doubt therefore whether it will be possible to secure general acceptance of the I.B.R.D. basis of subscription. On the other hand it would be inequitable and unwise if almost the whole burden fell on the two countries whosecurrencies are the key reserve currencies, and it is essential that at any rate theGermans should take a full share. We should certainly try to ensure that countries other than the United States accounted for not less (if very little more) than 50 percent, of the initial capital without ourselves accepting an unduly heavy burden,and I think this might be possible. A notional distribution might be as follows:  Per cent.        $ millionsUnited States      ............      49 980United Kingdom............      14 280Germany................      14 280Canada     ...      ............. 3-75 75Japan       ......      ...      ......       3-75 75Remaining 62 countries averaging $millions each          ...      ......      15-5 310Total ...     100 2,000
This would not necessarily commit us on voting powers. The principle has beenaccepted in the United Nations Special Fund that voting powers need notarithmetically reflect the size of the contribution of each member country (theGoverning Body is equally divided between industrial and under-developed countries, each member having one vote).C. Should we stipulate that investment by I.D.A. in the Commonwealth shouldnot be less than the amount of the United Kingdom Contribution ?10. I have examined this suggestion and have come to the conclusion thatit would be unwise to make any such stipulation. This might well provoke othercountries to make similar restrictive stipulations. The Commonwealth would suffer severely if the Latin Americans, for example, were to persuade the UnitedStates to stipulate that the major part of her contribution was to be spent in latin america; or the Six were to stipulate that their contributions, including the Germanmoney, were to be spent in their overseas territories.11. In actual fact the I.B.R.D. has so far lent to the Commonwealth as awhole nearly $1,400 millions ( 500 millions), which is more than five times theamount of the United Kingdom&apos;s subscription to the Bank. It may be claimed that our experience with the I.B.R.D. is not reassuring with regard to the Colonies,as distinct from the independent Commonwealth. Whatever the reasons for this,we could not ensure more favourable treatment by the I.D.A. without earmarkingpart of our contribution specifically for the Colonies, and this would, as I have said,be damaging for the Commonwealth as a whole. We should stipulate neverthelessthat the principles adopted for lending by the I.D.A. should be such that colonial territories received a reasonable share. And we should make it clear from the start that if this result is not in practice achieved we reserve the right to review thearrangements including the basis of the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution.D. How would the I.D.A. be related to the various United States Foundations ?12. Among the American philanthropical institutions are a number offoundations v/hich are active in under-developed countries. The most important of these are the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and the Carnegie Corporation.In general, the activities of the foundations include initiating and encouraging newresearch projects and investigations, supporting new educational endeavours andtraining programmes helpful to national development. The Rockefeller Foundationmakes grants to advance public health. The Carnegie Corporation (and theCarnegie Endowment for International Peace) specialises in education, includingresearch and conferences to discuss such subjects as the way to meet the needs ofthe emerging States of tropical Africa. The Ford Foundation supports, among others, projects in Asia, the near East and Africa intended to help to raise thestandard of living. These include basic research into economic and social problems,vocational training village development and leadership training.13. The interests and activities of the foundations thus lie in humanitarianand technical assistance and are of a kind which cannot replace but can usefullysupplement the capital development with which the I.D.A. will be concerned.Conclusion14. In view of the above considerations I again commend to my colleagues the recommendations in paragraph 10 (a) and (b) of C. (59) 50, namely, that:-(a) We should be prepared in principle to contribute to an international development Association on the scale and the conditions proposed.(b) I should authorise the Ambassador and the Economic Minister in washington, against this background, to continue their discussions withMr. Anderson and Mr. Dillon, the Under-Secretary of State, and withMr. Black, President of the I.B.R.D., but not at this stage to disclose the amount of any contribution which the United Kingdom might beprepared to make.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. I,8th April, 1959.
