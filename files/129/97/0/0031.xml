secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA.!ESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. May 1959&apos;Copy&apos; Nb.    61CABINETLIMITATION ON GERMAN ARMS PRODUCTION IN THE REVISEDBRUSSELS treaty memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsUnder Protocol No. Ill of the revised Brussels Treaty, Germany is forbidden to produce atomic, biological and chemical weapons, long-range and guided missiles, influence mines, larger warships and strategic bomber aircraft. Short-range anti-aircraft guided missiles, within certain maximum dimensions, &amp;c, whichare specifically stated in the Treaty, are excluded from these restrictions(Protocol No. Ill, Annex III, paragraph IV (d) Annex A). The Council of western European Union can amend these restrictions (except for restrictions on production of atomic, biological and chemical weapons) by a two-thirds majority,on the recommendation of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR)(Protocol No. Ill, Article 2 Annex A).2. In the course of 1958 the Council agreed to two relatively unimportantamendments to permit Germany to manufacture, first, anti-tank guided missilesand, second, one training ship with a displacement greater than the limits permitted in the Treaty. There have been Parliamentary Questions about these amendmentsbut no adverse public reaction.3. Early this year the Germans asked for an amendment to the Treaty toenable Germany to undertake, in concert with certain other Western european union (W.E.U.) countries, the joint production of anti-aircraft missiles. the background is an agreement between France, Italy, Germany, Belgium and theNetherlands, concluded within the framework of the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO) Armaments Committee, to manufacture jointly the AmericanHAWK surface-to-air missile. Production would be shared among the participating countries in proportion to-their requirements for this missile. The HAWK is a defensive weapon and has no atomic capability (although a future developmentof it might have). Its dimensions exceed the maximum permitted limits as laiddown (see Annex B.)4. My colleagues have already agreed that Germany should be permitted to take part in the manufacture of these weapons. But the Treaty is so precisethat it is not possible to cover this by an agreed interpretation. A formal amendmentis necessary which must be published. The Germans have circulated to W.E.U.a proposed text which would permit Germany to manufacture any guidedanti-aircraft missiles (Annex C).5. The problem is this. On the one hand an amendment which would leavethe road open to wide development of German missiles would be psychologicallyunfortunate at the present time both from the point of view of British public opinion and in the context of the wider negotiations with Russia. Moreover; theexpression &quot;anti-aircraft missiles&quot; might in years to come be interpreted as including missiles of very long range capable of destroying not only aircraft but other targets as well. An amendment such as the Germans have proposed, could therefore turn out to be an important curtailment of the restrictions on GermanSECRET .-?ho;.gbih55146C. (59) 815th May, 1959
arms production. But quite apart from current political considerations it is notin our interest that these restrictions should be gratuitously or unnecessarilycurtailed. c6. On the other hand the Germans have already been suspicious of usbecause of the delay in getting the amendment to the Treaty agreed. We have heard (from American sources) that these suspicions persist. If we insist on a more restrictive text we are liable to arouse fresh hostility and suspicion of our motives.7.   Broadly speaking there are three possible courses (a) the wider text put forward by the Germans;(b) a text which would limit German production of anti-aircraft missiles tojoint production with other NATO countries;(c) an amendment which would change the maximum dimensions given in the relevant article of the Treaty to permit German manufacture of HAWK.8. An account of the discussion in the W.E.U. Council on 29th April is at annex D. It will be seen that the French favoured course (c) above. The italian and Netherlands representatives supported the German request for alternative (a).No decision was taken.9. In the light of the Cabinet discussion on 28th April I consider that thebest course would be to support the French. The fact that the initiative has comefrom them should help to divert German suspicions from us. Moreover I explained the political difficulties referred to in paragraph 5 to Herr von Brentano, theGerman Foreign Minister, in Paris last week and he expressed understanding. Adefinite French proposal is awaited. But we should try to ensure, if possible byconcerting with the French before their proposal is tabled, that it gives dimensionswhich would permit German manufacture of weapons in the same category asHAWK, e.g., possible joint production with the United Kingdom of a Britishmissile (the question of air-to-air missiles would need further consideration) but notsuch a very different thing as a vertical take-off aircraft. This would go some wayto meet the German point and also our own interests. Admittedly it would permit the Germans to undertake the manufacture of HAWK or similar missiles alone ifthey wished; but it would be such a short step from joint production to soleproduction that a restriction in the Treaty limiting the Germans to joint productionmight not have great practical value. At Annex B is a table giving comparativedimensions of the HAWK missile and the British SUPER-BLOODHOUNDmissile on which we might want to co-operate with the Germans.10. When the amendment to the Treaty is approved by the W.E.U. Counciland published we should explain it on the following lines:  (a) the amendment does not contravene the spirit of the Brussels Treaty sincethe weapons which Germany is now permitted to manufacture arestrictly defensive;(b) the joint production of suitable air defence systems is of vital importanceto NATO and it is in the interests of the North Atlantic Alliance thatthe industrial capacity of the Federal Republic should be harnessed tojoint armaments efforts of the Allies.11.   I invite my colleagues to agree:  (a) that the United Kingdom representatives on the W.E.U. Council shouldbe authorised to accept the text of an amendment to Protocol III,Annex III, paragraph IV (d) of the revised Brussels Treaty which wouldchange the maximum dimensions fox anti-aircraft missiles manufacturedby the Germans to permit the manufacture of the HAWK and othermissiles in the same category;(b) that publicity guidance on the lines:of paragraph 10 above should be proposed to the W.E.U. Council. IS. L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,4th May, 1959.

: secret annex CDraft Resolution amending Paragraph IV (d) of Annex III of Protocol No. bill the Council of Western European Union,Considering Article II of Protocol No. Ill of the Agreement signed in Parison 23rd October, 1954, and Annexes I and III to that Protocol;Considering the recommendation made by the Supreme Commander allied forces Europe, in a letter dated 19th March, 1959, that the necessary action shouldbe taken to modify the present limitations on the production of air defence missilesso as to permit participation by the Federal Republic of Germany in joint production with Belgium, France, Italy and the Netherlands of weapons in this category;Considering the request submitted by the Government of the Federal republic of Germany in a letter dated 2nd April, 1959;Decide:Single Article: Paragraph IV (d) of Annex III to Protocol No. Ill is replaced by the following text:  &quot; (d) Proximity fuses, and guided missiles for anti-aircraft defenceare regarded as excluded from this definition.&quot;ANNEX DAccount of the Discussion in the Western European Union Council on the GermanRequest for Amendment to the Revised Brussels TreatyAt the meeting of the Western European Union Council this morning noobjection in principle was raised to the German request that Annex III toProtocol No. Ill of the Revised Brussels Treaty should be amended in order topermit the Federal Republic to take part in the joint production of HAWK missiles.2. The French representative said that although his authorities could not yetpropose a text, they were inclined towards an amendment to paragraph IV (d) of annex III which would only permit the Germans to take part in manufacturingHAWK as recommended by General Norstad. They were not inclined to introduce the principle of joint manufacture into the text because this might carry the implication that joint manufacture of other weapons would be permitted toGermany. The French authorities had in mind changing the limits of size, &amp;c, laiddown in that paragraph. (This would, however, presumably permit the germans to undertake the manufacture of HAWK alone if they wished.) The UnitedKingdom representative said that Ministers had not yet been able to consider theproposed text of the amendment, but he thought they would favour something onthe lines suggested by the French. Because of wider international implications thiswas an unfortunate time for amendments which would permit new developments inGerman arms manufacture.3. The German representative said that his Government would not favour alimiting amendment because they might later want to take part in the joint production of other missiles, for example SIDEWINDER (an American air-to-airmissile). Another possible example was joint production with the British of a verticaltake-off aircraft which could also be used as an unmanned missile. The textproposed by the Germans was intended to cover all such developments in order toavoid the necessity of having to obtain fresh permission from W.E.U. every fewmonths or so. The Netherlands and Italian representatives supported the German.They thought that it would have a bad effect on public opinion if the Council had tomake fresh amendments to the Treaty (which would have to be; published) at frequent intervals.4. The Council finally agreed in principle that the Federal Government shouldbe permitted to take part in the joint manufacture of HAWK and that it would resume discussion after the French had proposed a revised text for the amendment to, the Treaty, probably in a fortnight (13th May). This decision would be kept secret so far as possible, but if necessary (e.g., in reply to a Parliamentary Question),it could be said that the Council had given its agreement in principle and that thenecessary amendment to the Treaty was being considered. The Council also agreedthat the United States and Canadian Governments should be informed of its decisions.
