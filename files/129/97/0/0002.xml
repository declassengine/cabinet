$document IS THE f ROPE^Tt^^^bgjgt^^tyAWNlC IPrinted forthe-Cabinet. March 1959annic majesty^ government (59) 52*13th$farch, 1959Copy No, 5 8VOLUNTARY SCHOOLS: INCREASED AIDMemorandum by the Minister of education on 12th February the Cabinet agreed that I should continue to negotiate withthe interests concerned on the basis that-     i(i) The maximum rate of grant oh the categories of voluntary school building work now eligible for grant should be increased from 50 to 75 per cent.(ii) A maximum grant of 75 per cent, should be payable for the provision ofnew secondary schools needed to match aided primary schools of thesame denomination that exist at present (C.C. (59) 8th ConclMinute 2).The Cabinet also invited me to arrange for the necessary legislation to be draftedand agreed to consider at a subsequent meeting the appropriate time for its introduction.2. The attitude of the Free Churches remains substantially unchanged. Theyare opposed to both my proposals, but especially to (ii). They regard it as asubstantial departure from the &quot; settlement&quot; of 1944 and believe that it will open the way for the Roman Catholics to press successfully, possibly within a few years,their demand for grant for all new schodls.3. The Church of England initially had similar doubts about this particular,proposal, though they saw its educational advantages. I have now been able toremove their doubts and I have been assured of the Church&apos;s support for my proposals.4. The Roman Catholics have not abandoned their aim of securing granton all voluntary school building and they will, when they judge the time ripe,press this claim. But they acknowledge that my proposals will be a real help andtheir representatives have assured me that they will commerd them to theHierarchy.5. In the light of these exchanges I consider that we should be justified ingoing ahead. Even if the Free Churches press their opposition I do not believethat they will carry much weight, either in the country or in the House. Othereducational opinion, though not unanimous, is for the most part disposed to put the educational needs of the children first.6. I accordingly ask my colleagues to agree that, subject to its detailed termsbeing approved by the Legislation Committee, the necessary legislation should beintroduced immediately after the Easter recess and passed into law as quickly aspossible.G. L.Ministry of Education, W. 1,12 th March, 1959.54891CONFIDENTIAL
