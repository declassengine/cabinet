THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1959C. (59) 68 Copy No. g 520th April, 1959CABINETPENSIONS OF THE HIGHER judiciary memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in this memorandum I deal with two separate but related questions affectingthe pensions of the higher judiciary. The first is whether an improvement is needed in the pensions of members of the higher judiciary retiring in future. The second is whether those who have already retired should be brought within the scope ofthe forthcoming Pensions (Increase) Bill.Future Pensions2. The pensions of the English higher judiciary are statutory amounts notrelated to salary. They have remained substantially unchanged since the early19th century; but in 1950 provision was made for a quarter of the pension to be exchanged for a lump sum and widows&apos; and orphans&apos; benefits. The pension of theHigh Court Judge, for example, which was  3,500 became  2,625 with these benefits. When the salary of the High Court Judge was increased from  5,000 to 8,000, in 1954, the pension of  2,625 was left unchanged.3. This figure can hardly be considered adequate now in the light of upwardmovements since 1954 in salaries and other pensions. Further I understand thatthe existing gap between the salary and the pension of the higher judiciarydiscourages retirement and so militates against efficiency.4. For these reasons I am satisfied that an improvement in the pensions ofthe higher judiciary should not be deferred and I seek authority to consider withthe Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Scotland what improvementsshould be made, with a view to the submission of detailed proposals to ministers collectively as soon as possible. These proposals may include other changes,e.g., provision for graduated pensions and a retiring age. All changes in higher judiciary pensions will require legislation.Pensions Increase5. If it is decided not to improve future pensions there can, of course, beno question of giving increases on existing pensions. But a decision to improve the pensions of members of the higher judiciary who retire in future would notnecessarily involve improving the pensions of those who have already retired. Onthe other hand, given that the pensions are in effect the same as they were over100 years ago, that those who retire in future will have bigger pensions, and thatthe decision to introduce a Pensions (Increase) Bill has been announced, it is clearthat the point has to be considered.6. There are two possible ways of improving the pensions of those who havealready retired. The first would be to give retrospective effect to whatever rates were adopted for the future. This would offend against a fundamental principleof superannuation that improvements in basic pensions do not apply to those whohave already retired. A breach of that principle for the judges would make it moredifficult to hold the position against, for example, the Public Service Pensioners&apos;Council, who have urged and will no doubt continue to urge during the passage55056
of the Pensions (Increase) Bill that the pensions of those who have retired in thepast should always be kept at the level of those retiring currently.  I therefore do .not feel able to contemplate this solution to the problem.7. The second possibility would be to bring the higher judiciary within thescope of the forthcoming Pensions (Increase) Bill. The higher judiciary (but not thelower judiciary) were excluded from the 1956 Pensions (Increase) Act. There were two&apos; main reasons for this. First, although the 1956 Act was extremely liberalcompared with any of its predecessors, it was not thought at the time that those withpensions of  2,625 a year could be regarded as suffering even relative hardship.Secondly, to give pensions increase to judges who had already retired might haveimplied reversal of the decision taken only two years before that there should be no improvement in basic pensions.8. Subject to one point there would have been no technical difficulty aboutapplying the 1956 Act to them; and there is no technical difficulty this time. Themain scheme could be modified by regulations so that, like others on flat ratepensions fixed many years ago, they would receive an increase on their basicpensions at the maximum rate, that is, 12 per cent. It would not be possible to do this for those retiring after the operative date of the Pensions (Increase) Act but before new basic rates were introduced. There might therefore be three categories of retired judges of whom the middle one those retiring between, say, 1st July,1959, and the introduction of the new basic pensions would receive less than thoseretiring either before or after them. But I understand that it is unlikely that a judgewill retire during that period and if any were to do so it might be possible to makethe new basic pensions retrospective sufficiently to cover them.9. But unless the Bill were otherwise drawn, and special (and conspicuous)provision made for the higher judiciary, their pensions increase would come fromvoted moneys and not from the Consolidated Fund. This, and the fact that the modification would be carried out by delegated legislation, is a point of someconstitutional significance. But my colleagues may feel that it would be acceptable,on the ground that the arrangement would apply to a limited class for a limited period. Difficulty was not seen in a similar arrangement for the lower judiciary in1956; and if a different view were taken now, that arrangement would have to be altered too a further complication of the Bill.10. I see a greater objection in the size of the increases which the higher judiciary would receive. In my paper proposing a Pensions (Increase) Bill (C. (59) 55)I recommended that there should be no maximum increase this time. I said that my plan could produce extreme cases (for example a Permanent Secretary retiringbefore 1952 with 40 years service) of increases of as much as  250; but thatin practice anything more than  200 would be very rare. In fact the largest increaseof which I have definite knowledge is one of  253 for a Permanent Secretary who retired in 1950.11. If the higher judiciary were brought into the Bill some much larger figures would result. The extreme case would be that of Lord Wright, former Master of the rolls and Lord of Appeal, who retired in 1947 with a pension of  3,750. He would receive  450. Sir Henry Slessor, a former Lord Justice, who retired in October 1940,would (with one or two others) receive  420. Lord Goddard, who retired inSeptember 1958, would receive  360. I am not suggesting that this is unreasonable.But to the many thousands on small pensions who will receive small amounts under my proposals these figures will seem very large if they become known and it is virtually certain that they will. The only remedy would be to prescribe a maximumincrease in the Bill (as was done in 1956). I did not recommend this in my original proposals because (a) Whatever figure was written into the Bill (say,  150 or  200) wouldcomplicate it quite considerably, would still look high to the majorityof pensioners, and might lead to controversy.(b) It would add to the already heavy administrative task of putting the newincreases into payment. I think we would all see advantage in theircoming into effect as soon as possible. The imposition of a maximumwould slow down the process for a significant proportion of pensioners not only those with high basic pensions but those who draw smaller onesfrom different sources and for whom a cross check would be necessary.id) It would penalise the more senior officers (as well, of course, as the judges).
12. There is a further complication to which I must draw my colleagues&apos;attention. The Lord Chancellor has suggested to me that if retired Lords of Appealand Judges of the Supreme Court were to have their pensions increased it wouldbe unfair not to give the same addition to his only surviving predecessor, LordSimonds. He left the Woolsack in October 1954, but remains a Lord of Appeal.His pension as a retired Lord Chancellor is therefore in suspension at present, but when it became payable he would be entitled, to a pension increase of  450. Fromone point of view it would be reasonable that he should be regarded for thispurpose as a member of the higher judiciary. But it would be equally reasonable to regard him as a former Minister. If one former Minister were to receive a pensionincrease it would be difficult to answer those who might say that former PrimeMinisters (who now receive  2,000 a year) should also have it. And it might beheld that Mr. Speaker Morrison (for whose pension provision a special Bill will berequired at the beginning of next session) should have some increase on the figureof  4,000 which has stood for many years. Clearly we must consider very carefullywhether it would be expedient to give a pension increase to Lord Simonds.13. For completeness I should mention two other points. First, no difficultywill in any event arise as regards the widows of retired members of the higher judiciary. They have been covered by previous Acts and will be covered by the onenow proposed even if the higher judiciary itself is not. Secondly, although I havegiven examples only for England and Wales what I have said above applies tothe higher judiciary of Scotland and Northern Ireland.14. We shall need to consider, in the light of our discussion, the timing of any announcement.Conclusion15.   I invite my colleagues to (i) Agree that I should submit to them, after consultation with the LordChancellor and the Secretary of State for Scotland, detailed proposalsfor legislation to improve the pensions of the higher judiciary.(ii) Consider whether the higher judiciary should be brought within the scopeof the Pensions (Increase) Bill; and, if so, whether its benefits should extend to Lord Simonds.(iii) Consider the timing of any announcement.D.
