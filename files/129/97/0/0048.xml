(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTYC? HER.BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 98Uth June, 1959CABINETHQ LA DETENTION CAMPMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies have had discussions with some of. my colleagues on theadvantages and disadvantages of the various courses we could purusein the debate about hold which will take place on Monday.2. The following inquiries have already been set on foot:-&quot;(i)        Disciplinary inquiry under Colonial Regulations into thecharges put to Sullivan and Coutts (details of which form Annex IIto C. (59) 92), consisting of Mr. Conroy, Solicitor-General, Kenya,and two other senior public servants.(ii)        Inquiry into the future administration of the detention camps,consisting of Mr. Fairn, Canon Bewes and Sir George Beresford-StQoke.The first of these is, in effect, building upon the judicial findings ofthe inquest magistrate and is bound in some degree to establish theextent of the responsibility of Sullivan and Coutts for the incident, andthe extent, for instance, to which they can successfully claim to haveacted under superior orders.   Even if the charges are found provedthis may not show that no responsibility attaches to senior officersof the Kenya Government;  but only the result itself of the inquirywill show how far there is scope for any further investigation.   Thesecond inquiry will, among its other tasks, examine the merits anddemerits of using present rehabilitation methods upon the remainingdetainees, in the light of past experience, including the hold incident,and this examination is bound to lead to comments upon those methods.3. The question is now whether it will be necessary to set up ahigh level judicial inquiry into the hold incident on the grounds that nothing else will satisfy public opinion in this country.   If this isthought necessary, how and when should the decision be presented to the public?    There seem to be three main courses open.4. The first is rejection of a further judicial inquiry.   We should then, in the debate, explain and justify Kenya&apos;s rehabilitation policyand in the light of the results it has achieved, give a frank accountof any mistakes committed, and point out that there is no room for an inquiry because the facts have been (at the inquest), and are still(in the disciplinary proceedings) under investigation.The disadvantage of this course is that until we know theresults of the disciplinary inquiry we cannot assess how far, if at all, the Kenya Government as such, or other senior officersindividually, may have been responsible.    It may therefore be impossibleCOPY NO. V-I-SECRET
eventually to convince public opinion that the matter has been asthoroughly probed as possible without a further investigation.5.        The second course is, while defending the rehabilitationpolicy, to accept amongst ourselves now the need for a further inquiry,and announce it at an appropriate moment, probably after completionof the disciplinary proceedings.   The disadvantages of this are:-(i )       We would appear to the public to have given way to opposition pressure.(ii)        It would be very difficult to avoid a complete examination by any inquiry of the whole policy of using forced labour inrehabilitation, its justification in principle and the way it has worked in practice.   A judicial investigation - drawn, no doubt, from persons with no experience of Kenya conditions - would overlap the FairnCommittee and cause grave embarrassment if through lack of under-standing of the circumstances in 1954 it criticised what had been done.(iii)        But in addition it is not possible now to decide what groundsuch an inquiry could cover, sinc&apos;.e   until the disciplinary proceedings are complete the facts will remain unclear.   The inquiry would haveto be based on the inquest findings and the results of those proceedings,unless the latter appear on consideration to be biased or completelymisc onceived.6. Similar disadvantages attach to the third course, which isto await the serious accusations    - the Opposition may fling againstthe Governor and Kenya Ministers and then to say that these are sodamaging that they must be judicially investigated.   But this would avoid atleastthe appearance of giving way to pressure by the Opposition.On the other hand it would in effect enable the Opposition to fix the&quot;terms of reference&quot; of any further inquriy.   If such accusations are madewe could, however, rightly say that they must be taken into account bythe Government later in deciding whether further investigations arewarranted.7.        A possible course is as follows.   First, we must justify, in the strongest possible terms, the policy of rehabilitation by reference tothe success it has achieved.   This includes rehabilitation by the useof forced labour where necessary.   We must add, however, that this is subject to the Fairn Committee&apos;s recommendations on future methodsof rehabilitation.   Secondly, we must make it plain that because of the continuing disciplinary proceedings we cannot, without prejudice toSullivan and Coutts, and also to their superior officers who may be involved should they plead that they were acting under orders, give a precise account at present of where the exact responsibility for theKola incident lies.   The proceedings and findings, like those of theinquest, will be published.   At that stage we shall naturally consideragain, in the light of the findings, whether further investigations (whichcould include a judicial inquiry) are warranted.   In the meantime we arenot prepared to say anything further.   An advantage of this is that by thetime the disciplinary proceedings are available (at the end of June) we mighJbe in a position to resist the inclusion of past rehabilitation policy in thescope of any further inquiry on the grounds that the. Fairn   Committee hadvirtually completed its examination of this point.Colonial Office, S.W.I.10th June, 1959A. ju-B.-2-SECRET
