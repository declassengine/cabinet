C. H. Bailey (Newport, Mon.)(C.C. (58) 64th Conclusions, Minute 6). More detailed investigations showed a need for a more extensive and better scheme for developing the Dockyard for commercial use, with consequential changes in the financial arrangementsoriginally contemplated. The new scheme should have a reasonable chance ofcommercial success and will ensure as far as possible continuity of employment.In February the Prime Minister agreed to the proposed modifications subject to theapproval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Chancellor approved the finalscheme, the lease of 99 years was signed in Malta on 29th March and Messrs.Bailey took over the Dockyard on 30th March. The following summary of themain provisions of the agreement with Baileys is reported for information.2. LeaseTo facilitate the transfer, the Governor of Malta on 26th March enacted a comprehensive ordinance to unite under one title all the categories of land involved.One half of the rent is paid to the Government of Malta. Under the ordinance thewhole dockyard will become the property of the Government of Malta on30th March, 2058.3.

(iv) Interest on the unsecured loan will be excused for the first three years.After that period interest will be payable at 5 per cent., but actualservicing (whether of principal or interest) will depend on theprofitability of the enterprise and will be established at periodic reviews.(v) Dividend on the equity will be restricted to 12% per cent, unless net profitsexceed  250,000 above which level the excess has to be shared between her Majesty&apos;s Government and the company.These financial arrangements are designed to encourage the firm to put back intothe business the profits of the early years and generally to assist them in convertingand developing the dockyard as rapidly as possible for optimum commercial use.4. board the firm have accepted that their Board must be strengthened by a director of standing in the City who will command the respect of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the general public.5. Maltese ParticipationMessrs. Bailey intend to include on their Board a prominent Maltesebusiness man, Mr. A. Cassar Torreggiani, but in view of 3 (ii), they have not considered the time opportune to seek equity capital in Malta. The need to secureMaltese capital is accepted as an essential aim, but it has not been considered necessary to get the firm to commit themselves on timing or on the amounts. Theyhave in mind an issue of Preference Shares at 6 per cent, to 7 per cent, possiblyconvertible later to ordinary shares. It has been agreed that if these shares were issued in the first three years they would not be.subject to dividend standstill.6.   Admiralty Plant and MachineryThe agreed total price for this is  765,000 of which  230,000 will be paid shortly,and the balance in equal annual instalments between the fourth and tenth yearsof the enterprise. This concession has been made in order to make it more certainthat the firm can convert a third dock (No. 2) at an early date. This conversionis now included in the development plan.7.   Pension scheme a contribution, probably between  200,000 and  250,000 will be made to the firm&apos;s pension fund in respect of the older unestablished men taken over fromAdmiralty service. The cost will be borne on the Admiralty&apos;s Non-Effective Vote.This has been notified to Parliament by means of an arranged parliamentary question and Answer (Official Report 20th March, 1959).A.
