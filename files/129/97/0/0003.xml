SECRET 11.1.^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO/^ilDIARIES OF ROGER CASEMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and Lord Privy Seal and thethe Secretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsDiaries kept by Roger Casement, which came into the possessionof the police in connection with his trial for treason in 1916, have beenin the custody of the Home Office since 1925.   Successive HomeSecretaries for the last thirty years have refused to say whether thediaries &apos;were or were not in existence or allow any access to them.   Thequestions on which we now wish to consult our colleagues are:-(a) should the existence of the diaries now be disclosed;  and(b) should research workers and journalists be allowed access to them.2.      The history of the diaries is set out in Annex A to this memorandumThey belong to the years 1903, 1910 and 1911, and were found by the police in a trunk handed over by casement&apos;s landlord after his arrest in 1916.Typescript copies of the diaries were made at the time, and in 1922 a set of these copies came into the hands of a j ournalist, Mr. Singleton-Gateswho has recently published them in a book called &quot;The Black Diaries&quot;.The New York edition of this book contains the diaries for 1903 and 1910,both of which contain indecent material indicating that Casement was apractising homosexual.   A few copies of this edition have reached thiscountry.   A limited edition, published in Paris, is said to contain also oneof the diaries for 1911 described in the introduction as &quot;the cash register&quot;.It is possible that the book will also be published in this country.3.      The official policy of silence about the diaries was adopted, andhas been adhered to in the face of increasing difficulties, in the hope of limiting controversy both about the character of Casement and about theuse made of the diaries, and in the belief that if the existence of the diarieswere acknowledged the Government would be compelled to allow access tothem and would be accused by the Irish Government of further blackeningCasemenfs name.   In recent years this policy has exposed the HomeSecretary to considerable criticism in and out of Parliament, and has notprevented a lively controversy about the authenticity of the diaries, whichIrish nationalists believe to have been forged.   It has been freely suggestedthat the policy of silence is designed to cover up evidence of the forgery.We believe that the publication of the diaries has removed the lastjustification for this policy and has provided a means of escape from a  &apos;position which had become untenable;   and we think that the Home Secretarymust now admit that the diaries exist and are in his custody.C.(59) 5313th March, 1959&apos;CABINET
4.     If this is agreed, it is for consideration whether the Governmentshould itself take the initiative in seeking to establish the authenticity ofthe diaries by appointing a committee of enquiry or should simply allowaccess to them by historians and others who can form&quot; their ownconclusions.   &quot;We do&quot;not think it would be possible simply to admit theexistence of the diaries and refuse to do one or other of these things.5.     In our view a committee of enquiry would do no good and might doharm.   It is unlikely to be possible to assemble a committee whose findingswould be accepted by Irish nationalists;   the committee might commentadversely on the use made of the diaries in 1916; and it might refuse to conclude categorically that the diaries are not forgeries.6.      We accordingly recommend that the diaries should be placed in thePublic Record Office and that access to them should be allowed to bona fideresearch workers and journalists. \We do not think, however, that the relevant Home Office files should be made available, even to this limited extent.   They belong to a class of documents which will not be opened tothe public for 100 years after their creation, and though there is discretionunder the Public Records Act, 1958, to allow individuals to have access tothe files at any time, it is not proposed to exercise this discretion inrelation to files about capital cases.   Refusal to open the file may beregarded by the Irish nationalists as confirmation of their belief thatthere is something to hide, but the diaries speak for themselves and arelikely to convince all but fanatics of their genuineness.   The file showsthat some official use was made of the diaries after Casemenfsconviction to prevent his being regarded by public opinion, particularly inAmerica, as a martyr.   This is already apparent from extracts from aCabinet memorandum quoted by Mr. Montgomery Hyde, M.P. in the Houseof Commons on 3rd April, 1956, and reproduced in &quot;The 31ack Diaries&quot;;but to provide confirmation from official sources that the diaries were so used might, we think, do harm to Anglo-Irish relations.J We suggestthat if it is decided to give limited access to the diaries a statement should be made in the House about their history in order, among other things, to refute the story which has gained some currency that they came into the hands of the police long before Casement4 s arrest, and thatthere was, therefore, ample opportunity for indecent matter to be inter-polated in them.   This statement might be on the lines of the draft at annex B.7.      It is possible that the disclosure of the diaries will produce a protestfrom the Trish Republican Government.   The Ambassador can, however,point out that for many years Her Majesty&apos;s Government have preserveda policy of silence in the face of great difficulty in their anxiety to do nothing detrimental to Anglo-Irish relations;  that the hands of theGovernment have been forced by the publication of the diaries;  and thatit would be absurd either to continue this silence or to admit the existenceof the originals but refuse to allow access to them.conclusion. -   We accordingly recommend:--2-
(i)  that the existence of the original diaries should be admitted in&apos;   a statement in the House before Easter on the lines of Annex B;(ii)  that the diaries should be sent at once to the Public Record Officeand made available to bona fide research workers and journalistsauthorised by the Home Secretary to have access to them;  and(iii) that the relevant Home Office files should remain closed.R.A.B.H,13th March, 1959ANNEX AHISTORY OF THE CASEMENT DIARIESThe documents described as the Casement diaries consist offive books:-(a) an Army book 153 (a field service pocket book);(b) a Letts&apos; pocket diary and almanack for 1903;(c) a Dollards&apos; office diary for 1910;(d) a Letts&apos; desk diary for 1911;(e) a ledger containing accounts relating to dates in 1911.The Army book contains a few jottings apparently relating to 1901 whenCasement was H.M. Consul-General in the Congo.   The Letts&apos; Diary for1903 also relates to casement&apos;s work in the Congo and contains a fewentries indicating his homosexual proclivities.   The Dollards&apos; Diary for1910 and the Letts&apos; Diary for 1911 both relate in part to Casemenfsinvestigation of the atrocities which were alleged to be committed againstthe natives of the Putumayo region of South America by the employees ofthe Peruvian Amazon Company.   Both diaries contain indecent materialinterspersed among normal entries, that for 1911 in greater quantity thanthat for 1910.   They leave no doubt that Casement was becoming increasinglyobsessed by his perversion.   The ledger is principally devoted to notes of personal expenditure, but also contains notes about homosexual activities and payments made to homosexual partners.2.      Casement was arrested in Ireland on 21st April, 1916, and arrived in London on 23rd April.   On 25th April the landlord of his lodgings inEbury Street handed over to the police, at their request, certain property which Casement had left in his charge in 1914.   This property included a trunk in which the diaries were found.   Typesecript copies of thediaries were made at Scotland Yard for transmission to the Director ofPublic Prosecutions.   The copying of those for 1911 was completed on24th June.
3.      Casement was convicted on 29th June and the appeal was dismissedon 18th July.   The next day the Cabinet considered the question of reprieve.They had before them memoranda by Sir Ernley Blackwell, then assistant under-Secretary of State at the Home Office, dated 15th July, 1916, in whichhe described the nature of the diaries and which contained the followingpassages:-&quot;There are obviously grave objections to any sort of officialor even inspired publication of such facts while the man iswaiting trial or appeal, or even waiting execution.&quot;&quot;So far as I can judge, it would be far wiser from every pointof view to allow the law to take its course and by judicious means,to use these diaries to prevent Casement attaining martyrdom. &quot;(The second passage was quoted by Mr. Montgomery Hyde in an adjourn-ment debate in the House of Commons on 3rd April, 1956, and is reproduced in the recently published book &quot;The Black Diaries&quot;.)4.      Rumours of Casement&apos;s depravity were by then already circulatingin London.   It appears from a Press report that before he landed inIreland a story had been current that he had been arrested in Germany foran oJTcr.ce ed&quot; indecency.   The first Press reference to the diaries andtheir character appeared in the Daily Express the day after his conviction.There id no record on the Home Office papers of the diaries or the copieshaving been shown to anyone outside the Government service beforeCasemenfs trial.   After the trial extracts were shown to two alienists,who were asked to express an opinion on the mental condition which theydisclosed;  the possibility of a reprieve on grounds of insanity was thenunder consideration.   After the dismissal of the appeal a typescript copywas shown, on the Home Secretary&apos;s instructions, to Mr. (later Sir John)Harris, whose personal knowledge of Casement in the Congo the archbishop of Canterbury had commended to the Home Secretary&apos;s attention.   Eithercopies or the diaries themselves were also shown by Mr. (later Sir Basil)Thomson, Assistant Commissioner, Scotland Yard to the United states ambassador, apparently at the Ambassador&apos;s request.   The ambassador was given photographs of two passages.   Telegrams from the british embassy in Washington, of which there are copies on the Home Officepapers, suggest that the Embassy had copies or extracts from the diariesbut did not refer to them until after casement&apos;s execution.   Five days after the execution the Embassy reported &quot;We are using the journal, not for publication, but to warn politicians, the Press and the Church againstrunning Casement as a martyr&quot;.5.      casement&apos;s biographers have stated, on the authority of Casement&apos;sCounsel, Serjeant Sullivan, and his junior Counsel, Artemus Jones, thatthe Attorney-General offered copies of the diaries to the defence as apossible basis for a plea of insanity.   The Home Office papers contain no reference to this.6.      After casement&apos;s execution his solicitor pressed for the diariesto be handed over to the family, but was told categorically that &quot;the .prisoners diaries and certain other papers which came into the hands ofthe police in connection with the criminal charge must be retained bythem&quot;.   casement&apos;s executrix, Mrs. Farryj applied again in 1922 without success, but in 1924 obtained from the then Prime Minister,Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, a promise that the diaries should never be openedexcept by order of the Prime Minister of the day.   Mr. Baldwin was advised by the Home Secretary in 192 5 not to renew this pledge.-4-
7.      In 1925 Mr. Singleton-Gates, then a journalist, proposed to publish a book containing bowdlerised extracts from the diaries.   He has sinceclaimed to have obtained typescript copies from &quot;a person of some authority in London&quot;.   He has never disclosed the name of this person, but it isbelieved to have been Sir Basil Thomson.   He was seen by the thenHome Secretary, Sir William Joynson Hicks, threatened with prosecutionunder the Official Secrets Acts and required to surrender those parts ofhis book dealing with the diaries and with the verbatim record of Casemenfsinterrogation at Scotland Yard, of which he had also obtained possession.Neither the original copy of the diaries nor the record of the interrogationwas asked for,,   Mr. Singleton-Gates has stated that a few days later hewas shown the diaries themselves at Scotland Yard.8.     Mr. Ramsay MacDonald appears to have expressed a wish that thediaries should be in the custody of the Home Secretary, and after the HomeSecretary1 s interview with Mr. Singleton-Gates the diaries were trans-ferred to the Home Office, where they have remained.   Since at least 1930successive Home Secretaries have declined to say whether the diariesexist or not.   After the war there was little interest in the subject until1955, since when there have been several requests from authors andjournalists for information about, or access to, the diaries.   Questions havebeen a-k-&apos;1 in fche House and the Governmen.fr policy has been questionedon the ac;.i&apos;-&apos;v&quot;a-&quot;5rj-.snx. by Mr* Mo.&apos;.t&quot;.c:ornery Hyde.   The interest has beenmaintain-id      ;-,.vo biographies of Casement and a stream of articles in theFress.9.     It was suggested as early as July, 1916, that the Government wascirculating false information about casement&apos;s character (by Mr. M.F. Doyle,an American barrister who had come over to assist in casement&apos;s defence).About that time a note of the references in the diaries to Casemenfsvisits to, and correspondence with, the Foreign Office was checked withthe Foreign Office and found to be accurate.   Since 1916 Irish nationalistshave convinced themselves that the diaries were forged, either byrepresenting as casement&apos;s own a copy said to have been made by him ofthe diary of one of the persons whose activities he investigated in Putumayo,or by the interpolation of indecent material into a genuine diary.   The firsttheory will have been demolished by the publication of the diaries, which both relate to the period before Casement went to South America and contained references to his activities in other places.   The diaries haverecently been submitted to examination by Dr. W.R. Harrison, Directorof the South Wales and Monmouthshire Forensic Science Laboratory, anacknowledged handwriting expert, to see whether there is any evidence tosupport the theory of interpolation.   Dr. Harrison reported:-&quot;I have compared the handwriting in the diaries and in theledger with that of that attributed to Roger Casement in letters and documents in a Foreign Office file for 1911 and a Home Office filefor 1916.   In my opinion there is ample evidence to show that all theentries in the diaries and in the ledger were made by the person who wrote the documents attributed to Roger Casement referredto above.&quot;Dr. Harrison has stated, however, that some of the entries in the diarieswere added or amended at a later date by Casement himself.   These entriesinclude both ordinary and indecent material.-5-
ANNEX draft statement for some thirty years successive Home Secretaries of both parties have thought it right, for reasons which were fully explained tothe House in the debate on 3rd May, 1956, to refuse to say whether theCasement diaries e:r.ist or not.   With the publication of the diaries abroadthe policy of silence has ceased to serve any useful purpose, and I am nowable to say that the original diaries are in existence.The diaries consist of five books:-1.      a field service note book containing a few jottings apparentlyrelating to Casement&apos;s service in the Congo in 1901 and 1902;2. a Letts&apos; pocket diary and almanack for 1903;3. a. Dollards1 office diary for 1910;4. J..w;t.s! dosk dia:-y for 3.911-5. Vslger cc2Aa.iv.uig accounts relating to dates in 1911.Casement was brought to London under arrest on 23rd April, 1916.On 25th April the landlord of his lodgings in Ebury Street handed overto the police at their request property which Casement had left in hischarge in 1914.   Among this property was a trunk in which the diarieswere found.The diaries were retained at Scotland Yard until 1925, since whenthey have been in the custody of the Home Office.I propose now to place them in the Public Record Office and toallow research workers  and others with legitimate reasons for studyingthem to have access to them.-6-
