(59) 63 mscms --^opy&apos; No.  5917th April, 1959  &apos; - . 3  - Sp%iJ.f;s teoai 3i1T   ,fCABINETTHE MALDIVESNEGOTIATIONS FOR THE GAN AIR STAGING POSTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations in view of the publicity being given to our relations with the Maldives, mycolleagues may welcome a brief account of how things stand.2. On 17th March, the Maldivian Government suspended the negotiations with had been continuing in Colombo since January. They have since carriedon a bitter propaganda campaign against us, in particular accusing us of promoting a revolt in the three southernmost atolls, including Addu Atoll in which Gan is situated.3. At the same time, they have sent a Ceylonese lawyer, Mr. Nadarajah, toLondon to explore the possibility of re-opening negotiations. He has emphasised that the Maldivians are unsophisticated and highly suspicious people and that weshould discount the extravagance of their statements. He also thinks that anincreased financial offer would be likely to carry weight with the MaldivianGovernment.4. We have reiterated to Mr. Nadarajah our readiness to see the talksre-opened, and have informed the Maldivian Government that we will be glad toreceive a delegation as guests of the United Kingdom Government in London.But we have made plain that, if their wholly unfounded allegations against uscontinue, the climate for successful negotiation will be prejudiced. Their replyis awaited.5. The present situation, following the breaking of the news of the revoltin the southern atolls and the suspension by the Maldivian Government of negotiations, is in our favour in that (i) Work has gone ahead well meanwhile on Gan and we have unrestrictedpossession and use of the airfield.(ii) Relations with the local Maldivians on Addu Atoll and the neighbouringatolls have remained excellent and we have their full co-operation incarrying on the work at Gan.(iii) Although they have attacked us unrestrainedly, the Maldivian Governmenthave not in fact requested our departure from Gan nor sought toabrogate the Protection Agreement.6.   Factors on the debit side are (i) The Maldivian propaganda campaign against us is inevitably attractingattention to Gan airfield, which we would prefer to avoid.(ii) The uncertainties surrounding our position at Gan are unsatisfactory,and there remain a number of administrative problems, e.g., the resettlement of displaced islanders, which it will be embarrassing tohave to settle unilaterally without the co-operation of the MaldivianGovernment.55054CONFIDENTIAL
Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,16th April, 1959.(iii) There is a constant risk that, if we fail to patch up the quarrel with theMaldivian Government, they will eventually feel obliged to demandour departure from Gan and seek to end the Protection Agreement.They have no legal right whatever to do this, but politically it could .............................cause us considerable difficulties....................................................................(iv) As explained below, the revolt of the southern atolls could in time becomeiy*i      . an acute embarrassment to us. .7. The most satisfactory result for us is still the negotiation of an agreementcovering all we need. Our best policy is therefore to continue to adopt a conciliatory attitude while publicly refuting the Maldivian Governments allegations against us. We should avoid becoming committed to the revolutionary Government inthe southern atolls. Unless we are prepared to support them economically andin other ways (e.g., against punitive expeditions by the Maldivian&quot; Government,such as that recently conducted against Fua Muluku, some 35 miles north of Gan)they can have no future as a separate State. They would be a constant irritant to theMaldivian Government at Male, and we would be involved in a running dispute,which might conceivably come to a climax in an expedition from Male against the island of Gan itself; Nor can we rely indefinitely on the friendship of the localpeople at Addu. The possibility would always remain that a local faction might find it in its own interest to throw in its lot again with Male, and the obvious way forthem to do this would be to agree with Male in a policy of non-co-operation with us.8. I hope that the Maldivian Government will accept our invitation to cometo London. If they do come, it has been made clear that they must be preparedto negotiate seriously on the basis of the last document handed to them by us which contained all our requirements. We should, however, be prepared to offer them asrent for Gan a sum considerably in excess of the present figure of  2,000 per annumif it proves, as their lawyer has suggested, that this could be a decisive factor.9. In response to numerous requests, we hope shortly to arrange visits by selected correspondents to Gan Island to see the Royal Air Force installations.But facilities for visits to Male, the capital, or other areas must be settled by thecorrespondents themselves with the Maldivian Government.H.
