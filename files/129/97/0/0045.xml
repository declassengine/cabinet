Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1959C. (59) 95 Copy No.   5 68th June, 1959CABINETPROPOSED HILTON HOTEL, PARK LANEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Lord Privy seal the Cabinet should be aware of a proposal to build an hotel rather more than300 ft. high (the height of Big Ben) in Pitts Head Mews, Park Lane, a little southof Curzon Street.2. The building is to be in the form of a &quot; Y &quot; with its foot facing towardsHyde Park and, as seen from the Park, will give the impression of a tower. Thisis a great improvement on an earlier design which was considerably higher, hada higher plot ratio (total floor area to area of the site) and was in the form ofa slab.3. The London County Council wish to give planning approval to theproposal, which the Westminster City Council also find acceptable. The Ministerof Housing is satisfied that the promoters have gone a long way to meet theGovernments views and is in favour of allowing the project in its present form.Indeed, in turning down the earlier proposal, he informed the promoters, with theconcurrence of his colleagues, that he agreed in principle that a high buildingmight be erected on this site.The President of the Board of Trade is also in favour: there is a serious need &quot;for more hotel accommodation in London and this project will bring us in a great many dollars.4. The Minister of Works, who is supported in his view by the Royal FineArt Commission, would have preferred that the present proposal should be turneddown on the ground of its effect on the amenities of the Park, or at least deferred until the public reaction to very high buildings, which are now being erected inother parts of London, was known. On the question of amenities, it is relevantthat approval has already been given to the erection of an hotel 170 ft. high some200 yards away in Grantham Place. It seems, however, certain that any further delay in giving a final decision will cause the project to be abandoned.5. The Home Affairs Committee have discussed the question thoroughlyand agreed to the Minister of Housing&apos;s proposal that the Hilton Hotel project in its present form should be approved. When, however, the building begins togo up it is certain to arouse a great deal of public interest and probably controversy.I have thought, therefore, that the Cabinet should be aware of what is proposed and I invite them to concur in the Committee&apos;s conclusion.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W.1,8th June, 1959.55311THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
