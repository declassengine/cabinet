Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1959C. (59) 877th May, 1959CABINET- INTERNATIONAL LABOUR organisation memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service seek the concurrence of the Cabinet in decisions regarding a Convention(No. Ill) and a Recommendation (No. Ill) concerning Discrimination in respectof Employment and Occupation which were adopted by the International LabourConference in 1958. The texts of the Instruments were presented to Parliament inDecember 1958 (Cmnd. 593).2. The Convention places upon ratifying Governments an obligation to pursue a national policy designed to eliminate any discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin inrespect of employment and occupation. Certain provisions of the convention which imply some participation by the Government in determining the terms andconditions of workers, contrary to our established practice, raise difficulties for theUnited Kingdom. I propose, therefore, that the Convention should not be ratifiedand that the Recommendation, which supplements it, should not be accepted. the annex to this memorandum gives a summary of the provisions of the twoInstruments and fuller reasons for the proposed decisions.3. I further seek concurrence in a decision to extend the ratification ofConvention No. 87 concerning Freedom of Association and Protection of the Rightto Organise, which was effected in 1949, to include Northern Ireland in view of therecent removal of certain restrictions on the right of association of civil servants inNorthern Ireland which are explained in the Annex.4. Conventions and Recommendations of the International LabourOrganisation are ratified or accepted on behalf of both Great Britain and NorthernIreland. The Minister of Labour and National Insurance of Northern Ireland hasbeen consulted and concurs with the present proposals.5. If the proposals are approved, authority is sought for the issue, inaccordance with precedent, of a White Paper which would state briefly the action proposed and the reasons for it.6. The Departments immediately concerned have been consulted and concurwith these recommendations.I. M.Copy No.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,6th May, 1959.55171
annex . Convention (No. Ill) and Recommendation (No. Ill) ConcerningDiscrimination in respect of Employment and Occupation;-n The Convention lays on ratifying Governments an obligation to declare and&apos; pursue, in co-operation with employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations, a national policy designed to promote, by methods appropriate to national conditions and practice, equality of opportunity and treatment in respect of employment and occupation, with a view to eliminating any discrimination. For the purposes ofthe Convention, discrimination is defined as any distinction, exclusion or preferencemade on the basis of race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extractionor social origin, which has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation, provided that any suchdistinction based on the inherent requirements of a particular job shall not beregarded as discrimination. Further bases of discrimination can be added to the list after consultation with representative employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations.The Convention provides that Governments shall modify any statutory provisions and administrative practices which are inconsistent with the policy.2. The Recommendation, which supplements the Convention, deals with the formulation, application and co-ordination of an anti-discriminatory policy. it covers such matters as discrimination in access to vocational training, in placementservices, in remuneration and other conditions of employment and it recommends that the principle of equality of treatment shall be respected in collective negotiations and in industrial negotiations.3. The principle which these two Instruments seek to establish and applythat there should be no unfair discrimination between one worker and another inthe field of employment is clearly right, and the Governmenfs attachment to it was expressed by their representatives at the International Labour Conference.Nevertheless, the inclusion in the Instruments of sex as a basis of discriminationcauses difficulty for the United Kingdom. The Government itself does not apply the principle of equal conditions of employment, especially of pay, to its ownindustrial employees, and the general principle of non-discrimination based on sexis not universally accepted in this country. Any action taken by the Governmentto encourage the acceptance of this principle in non-government employmentmight be widely resented and regarded as a breach of our general policy ofnon-interference in the settlement of terms and conditions of employment. other provisions of the Convention also would require the Government to intervene inthe normal processes of voluntary negotiation and collective bargaining and acceptance of these provisions would be contrary to the established policy of theUnited Kingdom. These two major difficulties apply to the supplementaryRecommendation also and, in addition, the Recommendation contains provisions relating to Government contracts, educational establishments and privateemployment agencies which are not acceptable.4. It is proposed therefore that the United Kingdom should not ratify theConvention nor accept the supplementary Recommendation.II. Convention (No. 87) Concerning Freedom of Association and Protection ofthe Right to Organise5. This Convention was adopted at the 31st Session of the Conference in 1948.It was ratified by the-United Kingdom in 1949 but the ratification applied to GreatBritain only, because although the law in Great Britain was (as it still is) in accord with the requirements of the Convention, this was not entirely the case in NorthernIreland. Under the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act (Northern Ireland) 1927,and the Civil Service (Approved Associations) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1928,certain restrictions applied to civil servants in Northern Ireland as to membership of organisations, and the view was taken that this precluded the inclusion of NorthernIreland in the ratification.6. The restrictions in question have now been removed by the Trade disputes and Trade Unions Act (Northern Ireland) 1958, and the Civil Service (ApprovedAssociations) (Revocation) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1959. It is thereforenow proposed to extend the United Kingdom&apos;s-ratification of the Convention toinclude Northern Ireland.May 1959.
