CONFIDENTIAL&quot; !&apos;Z &quot;47THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 6024th March, 1959CABINETEGYPT:   FOREIGN COMPENSATION COMMISSIONNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer attach the draft of an Order in Council providing for the registration and determination of claims against the  271&apos; millionscompensation to be paid by Egypt.    I am sorry to have to ask mycolleagues to consider this at such short notice, but it is very desirablethat the Order should be issued as soon as possible, and arrangements have been made for its submission to a special Privy Council meetingimmediately after Easter.2. The draft Order reflects, of course, the terms of the Agreementbetween the United Kingdom and the United Arab Republic.   It thereforeprovides for claims in respect of:-(a) property which has been Egyptianised and is not to bereturned;(b) loss, injury or damage to property which is to be desequestratedand given back to the British owners.The Order does not in itself provide for payment inrespect of the claims;this will be governed by a subsequent Order to be issued later.3. I should like to draw attention to two points of difficulty which have arisen in the drafting of the Order and which may give riseto some political controversy.   The first is over the position of theOttoman Bank, and the second over cases where property formerlyowned by a British national in Egypt has subsequently been acquired by a non-British national.Ottoman Bank4. The Ottoman Bank operates under a Turkish Charter and isnot a British national.   It could, therefore, be held that it does not come within the scope of the United Kingdom/United Arab Republic agreement and does not rank for compensation out of the lump sum.   On the otherhand, the Bank is largely managed from London,   has a Britishchairman and holds its annual meeting in London;  it registered a claim with the Foreign Office for about  2 millions;  and this claim was taken into account by both sides in the negotiations which led to agreement on the basis of a payment of  27^ millions compensation.It would be a breach of fait h with the Egyptians if we were now to decide-1-COPY NO.
CONFIDENTIAL48that the claim is not to be regarded as covered by the lump sum.5. In these circumstances, after discussing the position withthe attorney general and with the Minister of State at the Foreign Office,I feel that the Order must be drafted in such a way as to cover the registration and determination of the Ottoman Bank&apos;s c aim.   Thequestion then arises whether there are any organisations or individuals in a similarly ambiguous position whose claims may call for similar treatment.   No such cases are known, but it is impossible to be quite sure that they do not exist.   On balance the best course seems to be tohave a provision which will refer specifically to the Ottoman Bank, butto be prepared to give an assurance, if it is alleged that there are other claims which are essentially similar, that they will, if necessary, beconsidered on their merits, with the implication that an Amending Orderwill be issued.Nationality6. There are probably very few cases where British property inEgypt has - since Egyptianisation or sequestration - been acquired by a non-British national, though such a change could have taken placein a number of different ways, apart from ordinary sale, e. g. , bya change of nationality on marriage or by inheritance on the death ofthe original British owner.   It is arguable that title to compensation should go with the property.   On the other hand, the United Kingdom/United Arab Republic Agreement was explicitly limited to propertybelonging to British nationals at the date of signature;   and indeed wewere not in a position to give a discharge to the Egyptians in respectof the claims of owners who were non-British at that date.   On thewhole, therefore, it seems better that the scope of the draft order should be limited accordingly.    Here again, I see no objection to an assurance in Parliament, if the occasion arises, that, should anycases of hardship emerge in this way, we should be quite ready to look into them.recommendation. I should be glad of my colleagues approval for the submission of the Order as now drafted to the Privy Council.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.24th March, 1959-2-
