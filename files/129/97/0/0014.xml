EXTRACTS FROM A SPEECH BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FORFOREIGN AFFAIRS IN THE COUNCIL OF THE NORTH atlantic treaty ORGANISATION ON THURSDAY, 2nd APRIL, 19591. Do We Want a Conimuation of the Cold War?I think it is wise for us to try to project ourselves into the future to someI extent and to see what hope there is of a real change in the situation. One courseof action is that tension should be maintained and the cold war should becontinued. There are some people who say that from the Western point of viewthat would be a good thing; that it would be easier to raise money for defenceif there is tension; that common fear keeps the Alliance together, that if there isa reduction of tension, it will give the Soviet Union possibilities of penetration bythe peaceful means of trade, economic aid, culture and the rest of it, and that iftension is reduced, neutralism will become more popular.On the other side, the arguments are that even the maintenance of tensionor the continuation of tension has not prevented Soviet progress in areas like theMiddle East. It imposes a burden upon our military resources and our defencebudgets, which is subject to challenge and which prevents as much being devotedto other means of meeting Soviet progress. There is always the danger that ina world governed by tension, there may be global war owing to miscalculationor drift. We have to consider whom the maintenance of tension really helps. Ithink that, in many ways, the Soviet have much more to fear from a reduction of tension than we have.The problems facing the Soviet Union can be put fairly simply. We allacknowledge that their transformation in one generation has been, remarkable.They are the second industrial Power in the world. They are still far from their objective of overtaking the United States but the gap is closing. In the fieldswhich they regard as important to their objective, that is to say rapid industrialgrowth, the creation of facilities for scientific and technological development, theprovision of an educational system centred on science, in those fields theirachievements have.been most impressive.But all this has happened deliberately at the cost of the welfare and standardof living of the Soviet people. Even in the urban part of the community real wages are, I am told, at half the British level and in matters like personal transport, decenthouses, labour saving devices, holidays, foreign travel, variety of food, goodclothing, consumer goods, reduction of manual toil, the protection of the worker,particularly women and children, all these are fields in which their system reallyso far has failed compared with the Western system. The Russian performance inmatching us in heavy industry and in science and technology, education, I think we must admit has been very successful, but they have failed so far to match theWest in the provision of human well-being and that is quite apart from-the cost inthe destruction of the liberties, happiness, freedom of thought and culture.The success in the one field and the failure in the other field is going to presentthe Government of the Soviet Union with massive problems in the future. I thinkany reduction of tension and consequent greater intercourse between the soviet union and the other nations of the world is going to accentuate these problems for them.During the visit which the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Irecently paid to the Soviet Union, we got some idea of the immensity of thesedomestic problems and the feeling of the pressures which they are going to createupon the Soviet leadership. There is just beginning to be the signs of some attemptto cater for the consumer demand. I think it is going to pose the most tremendousproblems of organisation for them. Now I think for that reason, and really theSoviet leaders talked about it at great length, for that reason, and also because they realise what war would mean, this is a stage at which the Soviet leaders genuinelywant a negotiation.They certainly want it about Berlin. There is no doubt that the reason why they want to challenge our position in Berlin is that they regard it as a centre ofespionage, for the gathering of military intelligence, behind what they regard as
their lines, and also the obvious fact is that it is a shop-window of the western world, illustrating those differences in standards to which I have just been referring;standards of human comfort. And I have no doubt that they want, if they can,gradually to squeeze West Berlin into the Soviet orbit. That is a conclusionwhich we are determined to prevent.Well whether I am right or wrong in this thinking of the problems of the soviet union in the future, my conclusion is, and I think it is the conclusion of theGovernment which I represent, that this is a time when the Soviets do want aserious negotiation and that if there can be a reduction in tension as a result of thatnegotiation then, because of the pressures which will be forced upon the Soviets for domestic reasons, it is in our own interest to make a success of those negotiations.2. Summit conference the Four Foreign Ministers certainly agreed that we should approach these negotiations with the intention of taking them seriously and constructively. these negotiations begin with a meeting of the Foreign Ministers. I want to explain, ifI may, to my Ministerial colleagues our attitude with regard to a Summit meeting.We favour a Summit meeting after the meeting of Foreign Ministers for thefollowing reasons:  We think that Mr. Khrushchev is the only man in the Soviet Government whowould take the major decisions. We also believe that the Foreign Ministers are more likely to make progress if it is known that they are preparing for a summit meeting. And if it is known there is going to be a Summit meeting it is less likely that unilateral action will be taken by the Soviet Union before that Summit meeting.We hope that the.Foreign Ministers will make progress so that the task ofthe Summit meeting will be to complete or to carry forward that work. But if,however, the Foreign Ministers do not succeed we shall have to face very serioussituations in which decisions will have to be taken by Governments on physicalpreparations for war. Then, in our view, it would be all the more necessary thata further attempt should be made to get agreement at the Summit. I believe thatour public opinion will really demand, before we embark on the physicalpreparations for war, that the final effort is made to reach agreement at the Summit.I know that some of our Allies do not see the matter precisely in this light, and do not attach the same weight as we do to some of the factors which 1 have mentioned. I certainly don&apos;t wish to exaggerate the differences of opinion oremphasis which may exist. We have fully accepted and will stand by the termsof our latest reply, our agreed reply, to the Soviet Government.3. German ProblemsNow, I come to the main topics for the negotiations and those are the problemsof Germany. I think upon certain points we have to be absolutely firm. We are going to preserve the free existence of West Berlin and the freedom of its people to choose their way of life and we are prepared for heavy sacrifices and to run greatrisks in that cause. Not only because of the people of West Berlin themselves,but because of the obvious reason if West Berlin goes, who goes next? Therefore,it is not only our wish to preserve freedom in West Berlin but it is because we wishto preserve freedom in the rest of free Europe, we have to preserve the free existenceof West Berlin.Secondly, in any plans or proposals to deal with the German problem, wethink that we have to avoid certain dangers. In our view, a neutralised germany is the worst solution to the problems of Germany. It is full of danger because,I believe, in fact the Russians would only accept a neutralised Germany whichwould be within the Russian orbit, and Germany, neutral in the centre of Europe,for reasons which have been debated many times in the NATO Council, is the worstanswer.Next, I think that what is called disengagement (or what should be calleddisengagement; because there is a good deal of misunderstanding about the word)that disengagement also is highly dangerous because it would result, could only54998
result; in a neutralised Germany. By disengagement, I mean the pulling apart of theforces of the two sides whether by saying that all foreign troops would leaveGermany or by saying that Germany and Poland and Czechoslovakia should be adenuclearised zone, or however it may be, disengagement, either of nuclear weapons, the pulling apart of nuclear weapons or the pulling apart by the takingout of foreign troops, that kind of disengagement is a grave danger to the strengthof our Alliance.Next, in any proposals we put forward, I think we must be very careful to seethat they don&apos;t alter the balance of military security to our disadvantage. Wemust be quite certain they do not weaken NATO and finally that they do not cause the United States and other Western troops to leave Germany. I believe that theconsequences of them leaving Germany would be that they would leave the mainland of Europe.I now want, as I have just been talking about disengagement, to say somethingabout the British idea for inspection and limitation of armaments in an agreed area.These ideas are not particularly new, but they have given rise to a good deal ofmisunderstanding and have been quite wrongly represented as being a form ofdisengagement. In our view, in any such plan of inspection or of the fixing of ceilingsfor forces or armaments, there should be no discrimination against the troops ofparticular countries, nor should there be discrimination against particular weapons.The ideas which we have put forward were not a means of preventing the unification of Germany as has been suggested. The purpose, in fact, was just thecontrary. Nor were they a means of preventing German forces being armed withnuclear weapons. What we have suggested is not, and nothing like, disengagementbecause much as we should like to see Soviet troops taken out of Poland and czechoslovakia and East Germany, the price that the Alliance would have to pay forthat in present and foreseeable circumstances is the removal of United States, Britishand other Western forces from Germany and so, as I said, from Europe; that is aprice much too heavy to pay for the withdrawal of the Russians. Therefore, for thepresent, and in foreseeable circumstances, we think that solution would be a very bad thing for the Western Alliance.You may ask what would be the advantages of having a system of inspection and limitation of armaments.On the question of inspection, General Norstad spoke very convincingly withinthe last few days. The advantages we would see in some such arrangements is thatthey would provide a safeguard against surprise military action by the other side.They would also provide for the establishment of a control system which would beof value in itself, but also, I think, could lead to increased confidence if it workedand were seen to work effectively. And, I think, there is another point of view.There is a good deal of propaganda on behalf of what is called disengagement. Thereare many parties and many individuals who have given that idea their support. one has to have a positive and not simply a negative answer in order to counter thispropaganda for the dangerous concept of disengagement.On the question of German reunification, I don&apos;t propose to add anything towhat is contained in the Four-Power Report, nor will I add anything on the questionof a peace treaty, except to say that I think we are all aware of the need for our proposals when they become known to win a response from our public opinion. Inother words, we must give great care to their presentation.4. BerlinI now come to the question of Berlin. Our thoughts, at the moment, run alongthese lines: these are not conclusions, these are thoughts. The optimum solution is that Berlin should be the capital of a reunited Germany and any arrangement otherthan this must be of an interim character, pending reunification. Meanwhile, west and by the position of last December: we are determined to uphold our rights.In practice, the present position in Berlin has worked tolerably well for the past10 years and there is no reason, if it were not for Soviet actions, why it should not continue without involving any threat to peace. But, on the other hand, I thinkit would be wrong for us to be too complacent about the situation which has existedthese last 10 years, or to assume that it is, in any sense, perfect from our point of
view. Owing to the geographical position of Western Berlin which we can&apos;t alter,we have to recognise that the Russians or the East Germans, acting under their orders, can at any time put pressure on the city. They can do this without taking any action against the position of the three Western Allies in Berlin and without any interference with Allied access to the city. It is within their power by administrativeobstruction and delays to cripple the economic life of West Berlin by holding upthe import of raw materials or the export of manufactured goods, and this could all be done without the use of force and in such a way that it would be very difficult to identify any single act in this process upon which, we, the Western Powers, could make a stand.I also think that we should recognise that our rights of occupation, though they-are legally sound, are not the ideal ground from the point of view of world opinion. To some it does not seem altogether convincing that we should continueto insist on the right of conquest 14 years after the war ended. There is equallysome difficulty from the point of view of presentation in arguing that the right of thepopulation in West Berlin to have unimpeded access with the West depends on thelegal case that the West Berliners are the subjects of the sovereign occupying Powers.If some of these arguments are difficult to present to-day, they will certainly not become easier to present as time goes on.So it is for these reasons that, in our view, we feel that we should take a goodlook at the status quo, that we should not assume that it&apos;s perfect from our point ofview, simply because we have got along reasonably well over the past 10 years. Weshould not abandon our present title in any way but we should see whether thepresent position can be improved and whether by some new agreement, whichwould not invalidate our existing rights, we could, in fact, give greater security to our own position and to that of the West Berliners.In this connexion, during these negotiations, we have got to probe the variousstatements which Mr. Khrushchev has made about the possibility of some new agreements, about the possibility of neutral or United Nations participation. Wemust not give up what we have, but we should see whether some new arrangement might be superimposed upon it which would reinforce the capacity of west berlin to remain free.5.   ConclusionsThat is our thinking, that along those lines studies should be made, that weshould review our position and see whether that is a promising line of approach to the part of these negotiations v/hich will be about Berlin.I said, Mr. Chairman, at the beginning that these thoughts are being puttogether in a rather disjointed manner but they are matters upon which we do verymuch want the views of our allies. We are very conscious of the responsibility which we face and the grave issues which are involved. There are plenty of pitfallsahead; we have to avoid the danger of war by miscalculation or by drift and wehave to avoid putting ourselves in a position in which the choice suddenly becomesone between war or a resounding diplomatic defeat. We mustn&apos;t bluff and then have our bluff called. Global war would be a disaster, but something which wouldbe very nearly as disastrous to the Western position would be to indicate that wewere prepared to fight about something and then have our bluff called and to climbdown because then it seems to me that our deterrent has gone and gone for good.If we are prepared to fight, we must take the necessary action and be seen to betaking it. That would involve very serious decisions for all of us and I thereforehope that we shall have a frank discussion of how these vital negotiations shouldbe approached. Having exchanged our points of view, the one thing we must seek to preserve at all costs is our unity in dealing with the Soviets at the negotiations.April 1959
