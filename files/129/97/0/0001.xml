-If;C. (59) 51 &apos;    &apos;&quot;&apos;13 th March, 1959. .   -:CABINETREPLACEMENT OF THE &quot; QUEENSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Transport and Civil aviation in M,ay, .at their Annual General Meeting, the Cunard Steamship company have to announce a decision on a most difficult problem with regard to theirweekly Atlantic passenger service. Queen Mary is now 23.years old and is near the end of her economic life. Queen Elizabeth is 19 years old and has abouteight years&apos; further service. The decision Cunard have to take is whether to announce that they are going progressively to close down their North Atlanticoperations based on the &quot; Queens &quot; or whether they will announce a programmeof replacement.2. When the &quot;Queens&quot; were built at a total cost of about  11 millions, asum of about  9 millions was loaned by the Government of the day and was indue course repaid with interest. To-day the magnitude of the problem is, ofcourse, quite different. Replacement costs may be as high as  30, millions foreach ship, but it will not be possible to be certain about:this or about final size and design until Cunard have had talks with their shipbuilders, John Brown and company. We have so far stopped them doing .this because such talks would be bound to become public and would provoke questions about the governments intentions. However, if the &quot; Queens &quot; are to be replaced Cunard claim that theycannot provide from their own resources more than  12 millions towards the costof the first ship, leaving around  18 millions to be found, spread over the periodof the building of the ship. Once Queen Mary was replaced, Queen Elizabethwould have to follow in order to keep a weekly service going. Cunard might beable to provide more than  12 millions out of their own resources towards thecost of the second ship but this is not yet certain. They say it would be impossibleto raise the balance through a commercial loan because prospective earnings fromthe replacements would not be sufficient to service it. The Company have,therefore, asked the Government for a commitment to provide the differencebetween what they can put up and the eventual cost of the ships.3. Their proposal is that this money should be made available by way ofa capital grant, to be repaid if earnings of the replacement exceed an agreed figure.The Company would retain this agreed amount to cover depreciation and remuneration of their capital employed; and 80 per cent, of any excess over thiswould be paid to the Government, leaving 20 per cent, with the Company. (the government&apos;s payment would be by way of dividend on the  20 share which itowns in the Company.) There would of course be no liability on Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to cover operating losses.4. This is not a proposition that we could recommend to our colleagues on financial grounds. Even on the Company&apos;s estimates the prospects of repayment of a significant proportion of the capital grant, still less of any return of incomethereon, appear slight. Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be participating with the cunard Company in the North Atlantic service against growing competition both from new foreign ships (the majority are heavily subsidised) and more aircraft.On the other hand, if the service were to be closed down there would be a loss of54897

foreign currency receipts, mainly in dollars, and probably some damage to our tourist trade. The bulk of the traffic lost would probably go to the United States Lines who are expected to receive a subsidy of some Â£30 millions on the new ship which they are building, plus an operating subsidy to meet the running costs. In our opinion, however, the most important point is the enormous loss of prestige to this country if the "Queens" were not replaced and if the weekly North Atlantic service were abandoned.

5. We are satisfied that Cunard cannot continue this service without help from the Government and we believe that the balance of advantage lies in assisting the Company. We should thereby also be giving a considerable fillip to the shipbuilding industry at a time when it views its future with growing disquiet. We do not, however, ask our colleagues at this stage for more than a decision in principle to accord aid to the Company, provided a scheme that is fair both to the Company and the Government can be devised. We should then be in a position to inform Cunard that they may approach John Brown and have the necessary discussions which would enable the Company to make detailed proposals to the Government as to size type and financing of the Queen Mary replacement. No final commitment would be accepted by the Government until we had this further information. It may, however, be necessary for the Government to make a statement in Parliament fairly soon, as it is unlikely that the talks between the Company and John Brown can be concealed. This statement should only say that the Government was discussing the matter with Cunard. We should be deluding ourselves, however, if we thought that once any public announcement was made we could easily avoid giving substantial assistance to Cunard. However, it must be our object to drive the best bargain we can to secure replacement of the ships while limiting the Government&apos;s commitments and improving its chances of securing repayment.

6. We ask our colleagues to agree:-

(i) In principle, that aid to the Company should be given for the purpose of replacing Queen Mary and subsequently Queen Elizabeth, provided a scheme that is fair both to the Company and the Government can be devised.

(ii)That the Minister of Transport should be authorised to inform the Cunard Company that, with the object of seeing whether a satisfactory scheme can be worked out, they may approach John Brown and Company for the purpose of drawing up detailed plans and estimates.

(iii) That for the present any statement made in Parliament about the replacement of the "Queens" should be limited to saying that the Government is discussing the matter with the Cunard Company.
