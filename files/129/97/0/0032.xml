Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1959C (59) 82 Copy No.   g 55th May, 1959CABINETTEACHERS&apos; salaries memorandum by the Minister of EducationTeachers&apos; salaries are negotiated by the Burnham Committee, representinglocal authorities and teachers. Its recommendations become effective only ifapproved by me.2. The last general revision of these salary scales came into effect inOctober 1956 and the Minister at the time said that he expected them to run forthree years. After a great deal of trouble an increase of 5 per cent, was negotiatedto take effect from 1st February this year. This was an interim cost-of-living bonusdesigned to improve the atmosphere for the detailed (and necessarily lengthy)negotiation of a revised salary structure.  These negotiations are now in progress.3. I consulted the Wages Policy Committee before these negotiations beganand they asked to be kept in close touch with developments. As, however, eventsare moving rather rapidly I am, with the consent of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,reporting direct to the Cabinet. It is very important that we should reach decisions which are consistent with our general economic policy and which will not prejudice our plans for educational advance.4. The teachers have put forward a claim which need not be taken seriously,but there is a strong case for a substantial but much more modest increase. this can be justified partly by the movement of prices, &amp;c, and partly by the need toprovide proper remuneration for the more highly qualified and responsible teachers.The various proposals and their effects can be summarised as in the Annex to this paper.5. At the request of the Wages Policy Committee I told the leader of thelocal authorities&apos; panel of the Burnham Committee that I should not find it possibleto approve a  15 millions increase in teachers&apos; salaries if offer &quot; C &quot; were to bemade at the meeting of the Committee on 29th April. He told me that his panel didnot in any case wish to go so far as this as a first offer, but that it was highly likely that the authorities&apos; panel would regard the offer as proper and necessary, andwould be pressing me further at a later stage.6. The members of the local authorities&apos; side have now decided by a majorityto endorse as a limit offer &quot; C &quot;. They did not put this forward at the meetingon 29th April, but made the more restricted offer &quot; A &quot;. This was rejected by the teachers, and the Committee then adjourned so that the teachers could consider further the details of the offer made to them on differentials, and the local authorities the teachers&apos; request for something more on the basic scale. The local authoritiesdo not contemplate making offer &quot; C &quot; at the next meeting of the Committee on13th May, but they may feel it necessary to do so at the following meeting on28th May, particularly if the teachers show readiness to accept the local authorities&apos;proposals on differentials.7. If we are not prepared to approve offer &quot; C &quot;, then I must reaffirm this tothe local authorities&apos; leaders. I ought to do so before 13th May, since it might affectthe way in which they play their hand.55148W THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
8. If the local authorities make offer &quot; B &quot; and it is rejected by the teachers,as it almost certainly will be, then the local authorities will have two choices. Theymay either make offer &quot; C &quot; and, if it is accepted by the teachers, it will fall to meto turn it down: or they may seek to involve me at once in saying to both sidesthat I am not prepared to go any further, though the local authorities would themselves be willing to go as far as &quot; C &quot;. On either alternative the Governmentwould be standing alone and, on the merits of the present case, I do not myselfthink that we should get into this position.9. I therefore recommend that we should accept the limit offer &quot; C,&quot; if it is put to us. My reasons can be summarised as follows (a) I am sure that the proposal to increase the expenditure on differentialpayments for high qualifications and responsibility is fully justified.(b) A strong case can, I think, be made out for some improvement at themaximum of the basic scale with the needs of the man teacher withfamily responsibilities in mind. The present maximum of  945 doesnot compare well with the rewards available to non-graduate men inoccupations of comparable standing, e.g., in the Civil Service.(c) The case for the proposed increase at the minimum of the basic scale is not so strong, but at this point comparison with changes in the cost of living and wage rates is particularly relevant. There is no simple comparison between a possible further percentage increase in teachers&apos; salaries andother percentage increases which may be awarded this year, sinceteachers&apos; salaries are not negotiated annually. The proper comparison is with the three-year period from October 1956 to October 1959 (newsalaries for teachers cannot take effect before next October).Over the three years, offer &quot; B &quot; would mean an increase of 1\ percent, at the minimum, and offer &quot; C &quot; about 9\ per cent. Over the sameperiod the cost-of-living index will have increased by about 1\ per cent.Wage rates increased by about 9 per cent, during the two-year period1957 and 1958, and I conclude from the latest survey of wage movementsby the Minister of Labour that from October 1956 to October 1959 theincrease will prove to be at least 11 per cent.10. The local authorities would perhaps be on even stronger ground if theywere proposing something slightly smaller than offer &quot; C,&quot; e.g., something costing about  12 millions or  13 millions (rates and taxes together). But (a) If we approve offer &quot; C,&quot; it would certainly be my intention to see that thenew scale should run for another three-year period. This is much betterthan frequent small adjustments.(b) The local authorities have in effect decided that offer &quot; C &quot; is right, after considering the needs of the schools and the importance of making the teachers an offer which they cannot reject without losing the sympathy of the public. While they take this line, I should see great difficultyin the Government having to accept sole responsibility for a breakdownfor such a relatively small difference.11. I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that, in any further consultations with the leader of the local authorities&apos; panel, I should take the line that (a) If they proceed to make offer &quot; C &quot; and it is accepted by the teachers, I shallbe willing to approve the resulting proposals.(b) If this offer is made and the teachers make difficulties about it, I shouldbe willing to join with the local authorities in refusing to go any further.Ministry of Education, W. 1,5th May, 1959.

If an agreement is reached over these salaries, consequential additionsmust be expected to cover the teachers in technical colleges, training colleges, and other kinds ofinstitution.   These would add about one-seventh to the total additional salary bill.
