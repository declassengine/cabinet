Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1959Copy No.   68CABINETARMS FOR THE CARIBBEANMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 17th February my colleagues invited me, in consultation with the Presidentof the Board of Trade, to circulate a memorandum on the scope for the exportof arms and civil equipment to the Dominican Republic (C.C. (59) 10th Conclusions,Minute 4).2. This question must be considered in the context of the tense situationin the Caribbean arising from the revolution in Cuba. Although the Prime Ministerof Cuba, Dr. Fidel Castro, has said he will not lead liberation movements, hisvictory, and his pronouncements since, have resulted in Cuba&apos;s becoming a centre for activities directed especially against the dictatorial regimes of General Trujilloin the Dominican Republic, and President Duvalier in Haiti. Dr. Castro has lostprestige because of the executions, his own arbitrary behaviour and his lack ofcoherent policy. But he still commands great emotional support, not only inCuba, and feelings against dictatorships remain strong, practically throughoutLatin America and particularly in Venezuela and Mexico.3. In the Dominican Republic, General Trujillo is trying to buy armswherever he can, in self defence against the danger of an invasion, whetherlaunched direct or through Haiti. His regime is ruthless and the sale of &quot; sharp &quot;arms by the United Kingdom would arouse strong hostile reactions both here and in Latin America. Nevertheless General Trujillo&apos;s overthrow would in all probability lead to chaos in the Dominican Republic and even greater instabilityin the. area as a whole.The United States Attitude4. The United States Government have decided to suspend the supply ofarms to the area for the time being, and are now pressing&apos;all friendly supplying countries, including the United Kingdom, to do likewise. On the other handbetween 1st January and 10th February they approved the export of various items,mainly aircraft spares to the Dominican Republic, and more recently six smalltrainer aircraft and a C. 74 Globemaster and a C. 74 V.I.P. aircraft to Cuba.The United States Government hope to avoid driving either side into purchasingfrom the Soviet bloc by explaining that their policy is not an embargo but a practicesubject to continuous review in consultation with the other Governmentsconcerned.Anglo-Dominican trade. The United Kingdom has an adverse trade balance ( 10 millions in 1958and almost  20 millions in 1957). There is little prospect of our being ablesignificantly to increase exports of traditional lines of goods (motor vehicles,C. (59) 7120th April, 1959SECRETTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT55077
industrial machinery), but the Dominican Government are consideringelectrification schemes covering the whole country (a total figure of  100 millionshas been mentioned) and have suggested the possibility that large-scale orders forelectrical equipment might be placed here (C.C. (59) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 5).Various British firms including Associated Electrical Industries and InternationalCombustion Limited are showing great interest. Although the Dominicans would prefer to place their main civilian orders with any country which will also supplyarras, as a Government-to-Government transaction, it is hoped that even if theUnited Kingdom supplies no arms some big contracts may come our way.Nevertheless a change in regime might prevent their fulfilment and lead eventually to losses for British firms.6. In reply to insistent pressure to supply them with a wide range of arms, theDominicans have been told that it is politically impossible for us to do so at present,although the position might be reconsidered in a few months&apos; time. We havesuggested however that they should supply us with a list of marginal items and civilian requirements. This list has not yet reached us, and meanwhile theDominicans are believed to be buying arms elsewhere, particularly through Spain,France, Belgium, Sweden and Holland. The United States appeal for a suspension of supplies has been addressed to all these countries.7. Marginal items might include helicopters, patrol vessels (if unarmed) andpossibly aircraft spares. Approval has already been given to the sale of fourunarmed helicopters fitted out for air-sea rescue work. There is a case for supplyingaircraft spares when the aircraft are of British design, and United kingdom manufacturers have been penalised by the complete ban we have maintained inrecent months; but the United States would strongly object if we did this and itwould make it more difficult for them to restrain other countries. But the releaseof a few unarmed patrol vessels, for which the Dominicans have been pressing hard,would be less objectionable and together with the sale of the helicopters mightnotably improve our prospects of obtaining a share of the large civil orders. It was originally proposed that the release of patrol vessels from stocks should be accompanied by the placing of orders for further small ships of a similar type inBritish yards, which would be particularly welcome from the point of view ofemployment. But it is desirable that any exceptions to the embargo should be on aonce-for-all basis and exceptions relating to the fairly distant future would be likelyto prejudice the success of the United States proposal.Anglo-Cuban Relations8. Dr. Fidel Castro has ambitious plans for the economic development ofCuba, and our prospects of securing a fair share of any large civil orders that maymaterialise are good. But he has been pressing us for the release of the five SeaFuries which were sold to the former Government under General Batista, and whose delivery was stopped last December. On 17th February the cabinet approved the release of these aircraft at an appropriate moment. In accordancewith the undertaking given on 15th December, Parliament may have to beinformed before they are despatched. It may therefore be impossible to avoidsome publicity.  Release of the aircraft would:  (a) run contrary to the United States&apos; policy of suspending all arms supplies;(b) have to be balanced by sales of comparable importance to the DominicanRepublic if strong reactions there are to be avoided.9. There are no strong grounds for making any further exceptions to the embargo in respect of Cuba. Imperial Chemical Industries Limited have been pressing for the reinstatement of a licence revoked in December for the export ofsporting ammunition to Cuba, but the ammunition is mainly rifle cartridges and could obviously be used for military purposes.Conclusions10. The Caribbean is an area where the United States have the primaryconcern and responsibility. In the interests of Anglo-American relations it wouldbe most undesirable for the United Kingdom to oppose United States policy in this area if vital British interests are not affected. The unrestricted sale of arms is likely
to prejudice stability and a suspension would at least have some advantage in ourparticular relations with Cuba and the Dominican Republic, in so far as sales to either would antagonise the other. Sales to the Dominican Republic might arousegreat criticism both at home and throughout Latin America. The circumstancessurrounding the release of the five Sea Furies to the Cubans, however, and abalancing sale of-small ships to the Dominicans are exceptional. Their release,alone, should not prejudice stability in the area nor the United States efforts tobring about a general suspension of supplies. Our case is much strengthened byithe fact that other countries including the United States have sold military equipment to the area while we have been imposing an embargo since the beginningof the year. We could justifiably expect the Americans to accept the exclusion of the items in question from any suspension.11. Exceptions could not however be so easily justified for certain other itemssuch as aircraft spares and sporting ammunition which have been proposed asmarginal nor for contracts for future deliveries of ships to the Dominican Republic.Recommendations12.   I therefore recommend to my colleagues:  (i) Acceptance of the United States proposal for a general suspension of armsdeliveries for the time being; the position to remain under continuous review in consultation with the United States and other Governments.(ii) As the only exceptions to the above, the early release to Cuba of the fiveSea Furies and to the Dominican Government of up to four smallunarmed patrol vessels; in both cases assurances that these items wouldbe used for defensive purposes only should be sought.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,20th April, 1959.
