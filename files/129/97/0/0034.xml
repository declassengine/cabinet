secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1959C. (59) 84 Copy No.5th May, 1959CABINETRURAL  BUS  services memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation seek the agreement of my colleagues to my setting up a small committee toconsider the future of rural transport, particularly buses.2. My colleagues will know that pressure is growing for action to arrest thedecline of public transport in rural areas. The recent Budget concession on exciseduty for buses, although it gave the bus industry as a whole  3^ millions per annum,is not regarded by some Members of Parliament as sufficient, although it will go some way to meet the problem.How the Problem Arises3. Rural bus services are, of course, being affected by the general decline intraffic on public transport, due mainly to the increasing use made of private cars,motor-cycles, &amp;c. Bus companies subsidise their rural services from revenue ontheir more profitable urban routes, but with a general fall in revenue, this is becoming more difficult. Normally, services are not withdrawn until traffic has fallen very low, and the growing volume of complaint is in fact probably out of proportion to the hardship suffered. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the deterioration of services is arousing strong feelings in many parts of the country.An Inquiry, or Further Tax Concessions to the Bus industry. It seems likely that unless the Government can announce some further action in the matter there will be strong pressure, during the remaining stages ofthe Finance Bill for further concessions for bus companies, particularly on fuel tax.It has been suggested that the concessions be limited to rural services, but I do not regard this as feasible because of the difficulty of satisfactory definition. perhaps the best way of meeting the situation would be to set up a committee to inquire intothe causes of the decline in rural bus transport and to consider whether there is any means of arresting it. Such an inquiry, which has been asked for by a number of responsible bodies, would have the advantage of meeting for the time being variouspressures for further concessions. It should also stem the flow of complaints aboutrural services.Risks of an Inquiry5. There is admittedly some risk in having such an inquiry. The committee might recommend that the Government should give rural services financialassistance either by reduction in fuel tax or by direct subsidy. The committee might even accept the view that transport in rural areas should be treated as a social service and provided irrespective of cost.55154
Advantage of an Inquiry6. On the other hand, the committee might be able, as a result of discussionwith those most directly affected, to make more acceptable recommendations whichwould help in the provision of the most essential rural services. They might alsobring out some of the real difficulties arising from the spread of private transport.conclusion. In spite of the risks involved, I think that, on balance, there is a case for setting up a small committee to consider, in particular, the future of rural bus services. I suggest that the precise terms of reference, which will need carefulconsideration, should be left to be agreed by me with the Chancellor. I have in minda fairly small committee with an independent chairman and possibly representativesof the bus operators, the Trade Unions, the National Farmers&apos; Union, and theCounty Councils Association.H.
