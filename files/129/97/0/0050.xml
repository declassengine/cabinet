IHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 100 COPY NO. bs%,15th June, 1959CABINETEDUCATION: TEACHERS&apos; salaries memorandum by the Minister of EducationAs agreed by the Cabinet on 4th June (C.C.(59) 33rd Conclusions,Minute 5), I attended the meeting of the Burnham Committee on thefollowing day and made the statement set out in the Annex to this paper.My statement about the minimum of the basic scale was criticised aspremature interference with negotiations, though I do not accept this asexpressing a correct view of the relations between a Minister ofEducation and the Burnham Committee.   No similar criticism was expressed if my saying that I could approve proposals which would add 15 millions to the salaries bill, but not more, though the teachers will,of course, continue to claim that the figure should be larger.2.     After T. had left the meeting, the local authorities - in spite of my statement - renewed their offer of a basic scale running from  520 to 1,000 ana the teachers, after a good deal of hesitation, accepted this.They were, no doubt, influenced by what I had said.   At a later meetingon 10th June, other details, apart from the basic scale, were settled and the Committee then published a summary of their proposals.   Thisintroduces a very important new element into the situation, since it shows that both sides have agreed that the new salary scales should becurrent for Z\ years from October, 1959.   Under the Committee&apos;s normal procedure these proposals will be referred to the constituentassociations of local authorities and teachers before they are definitelysubmitted to me for my approval.3.      Under the Education Act, 1944, no changes are possible inteachers&apos; salaries unless the Burnham Committee submits agreedrecommendations to the Minister and they are approved by him.   He canapprove or reject the recommendations as put to him but he cannot varythem.   The process of consulting constituent associations will take several weeks, but proposals are due to reach me soon after 8th Julyincluding the  52 0 minimum - which I have said I cannot accept. If then turn them down, then:-(a) If the Committee were willing to submit alternative proposals thatt could approve, and were ready to do this quickly, it is just possible thatthe wh&apos;Te process of submission, approval and further formalities couldbe carrier.&apos;&apos; through in time for new salary scales to come into operationnext October, as the teachers now hope.(b) Or the Committee might try to maintain their position.   In that case it would be quite impossible to bring new salary scales into effect by October.    It is difficult to forecast what form the ensuing controversy-1-
would take.   Some elements on the local authority side would like the burnham Committee to resign;   some of the teachers are talking aboutworking to rule;  but it is certain that there would be a strong reaction from both sides, and the Opposition c ould be expected to exploit thesituation.4.      My original advice was that the difference between  510 and 520 for the minimum of the basic scale was not big enough to justify a row in which the local authorities and the teachers would be unitedagainst us.   But in the light of all that has happened, there seems to meto be a string case for sticking to the line that we have been taking.   the argument that it is part of a general policy concerned to maintainstability in the economy has not been very widely taken up, but enoughhas been made of it to ensure that it would damage our reputation toabandon it.   Also, if we change our line, we should virtually have concededthe principle that the Minister of Education is n^t concerned with anycomponent part of the salary proposals submitted to him, but only withtheir total cost.    For that is what is really implied in the burnham committee&apos;s criticism of my action as unjustified interference with negotiations.5.      On the other hand, the unexpected adoption by the Committee ofa 2.-&apos;- year currency for their new salary recommendations has considerably weakened our general economic argument, based onconcern for stability in the economy.    The fact is that on the Committee&apos;sproposals the teachers would receive at the minimum of the basic scalea total increase of only 9jr per cent over a period of 5-f; years from october, 1956.6.      If we decide to maintain our present position, I shall have to do all that I can to make it likely that the Burnham Committee will, in theevent, choose the alternative which I have mentioned at paragraph 3(a);and to protect the Government so far as possible from damagingcriticism if the teachers have to wait longer than necessary beforegetting their salaries revised.   I do not think we can afford to wait tillproposals are formally submitted to me.7.      This would mean that I should use any opportunities that arise in the interval for repeating what I have already said about my inability to approve proposals including a basic scale that starts above  510.   i could justify this, up to a point, on educational arguments;   I could showthat the proposals as a whole, on the basis of  15 millions to be addedto the salary bill, embody a generous offer, and that many teachers would benefit by the improved maximum and the improved differentials forgraduates,headteachers, etc.3.      But, in order to carry conviction that the Government is not beingsilly over the &quot;little difference&quot; of  10 between  510 and  520 at the starting level, I should also need to use publicly the general argumentset out in paragraphs 3, 4 and 8 of the statement I made to the burnham committee.   In particular, paragraph 8 of the statement agreed in cabinet on 4th June stated that if I were to approve a further increase-of 4j per cent at the minimum for teachersT&quot;salaries&quot; there is aTrealdanger that it would be taken to represent trie Government&apos;s view of what might be a reasonable increase&apos;over the wages field geTie&quot;Fally&quot;&apos;at this time.   After cohTultatdTon-witiTThe Mini^elT^^iraTJloTIrT^agrliieclHiKaTliKis-2-CONFSDENTSAL
part of mv statement should not be included in full in the summaryissued to the Press after the meeting of the Burnham Committee-.   Thissaid simply that, in the Governments view, a further 4p- per cent increase for teachers would not be right at the starting level.   But Ido not doubt that, in defending the Governments general position onthis important matter, I should be obliged to bring out the full text,as underlined.   Before doing this I should like to be sure once againthat I have the support of my colleagues and that the implications of following this course are appreciated, especially in the light of thedecision about the Z\ year currency of the new salary agreement.9.     As this raises important issues of policy, I have thought it rightto consult the Ca.binet before taking the line described in paragraphs 6,7 and 8 of this paper.G.L.Ministry of Education, W,l.13th June, 1959ANNEXStatement by the Minister to the Burnham CommitteeI was sorry to hear from your Chairman after your last meeting that you had been unable to reach agreement on the basis upon which anew salary report could be framed.    On receiving this news I at oncetold him that if the C ommittee wished it, 1 was ready to take the unusualstep of coming myself to meet the Committee.   A similar course wasadopted in not entirely dissimilar circumstances by the present HomeSecretary, when he was Minister of Education.    His purpose was, asmine is now, to try to help the Committee to reach an agreement byletting them know the sort of settlement which the Minister would be ableto approve.2.      I want to begin by emphasising two things.   First, the Governmenfsconcern that the teachers&apos; salaries should correspond properly with theimportant services which they render to the community.   The need forthis has become increasingly recognised in the post-war years.   this need has, I think, found expression in each of the post-war Burnhamsettlements, but each time the apparent gain in salary has been eateninto by further rises in the cost of living.3.      This brings me to my second point.   It is more than ever import&quot;ant for the nation as a whole and for the education service as an essential part of the national life that we should now avoid inflationary increases in personal incomes, particularly wages and salaries.   Otherwise wehasard all that we have gained, both for the nation and for the education service.   During the past year we have been able to achieve a soundbalance of payments and reasonable stability in prices.   This has beenhelped by an increasing moderation in wage settlements.   As a result-3-
we now have within our grasp increasing opportunities for economic expansion - upon which the prospects for improving standards of lifedepend.   It is of immense importance - I cannot sufficiently emphasise the gravity of it to you - that nothing should now be done to endanger theprospects of continuing stability in prices and of the economic progressfrom which we have so much to hope.4.      All this means chat it is specially important to avoid increases in wages or salaries which would be inflationary in their effect, and I need hardly remind you that it is the professional classes as much asanyone that have suffered as a result of inflation in the past.5.      So far as teachers are concerned, we realise, as do theauthorities, that the time is ripe for some further advance in their salaries.   But in considering what form this should take, we believe thata distinction must be drawn between salary increases designed to main-tain real values and those which provide and are meant to provide arise in real terms.6.      I understand that at the Committee&apos;s last meeting theAuthorities&apos; Panel offered the Teachers&apos; Panel a new basic scale of 520 rising to  1,000 by annual increments of  27. 10.  Od. togetherwith improvements in the differential payments, and that theseproposals, if they were agreed and approved, would add some  15 millions to the nation&apos;s salary bill for primary and secondary school teachers.I can say straight away that I see no reason to question these proposals from the point of view of their total cost.   Indeed, with one importantreservation, I can say that the general pattern of the authorities&apos; offer would lead to proposals which I, as Minister, would be ready to approve,if they were submitted to me.   In saying this I have in mind how import-ant it is to meet the needs of teachers who have embarked upon theircareer and are incurring family responsibilities, as well as to provideproper rewards for teachers who are highly qualified or who hold,positions of responsibility in the schools.   This leads me to welcome the maximum of  1,000 at the top of the basic scale and the improvements in differential payments which have been proposed.7.      As the local authorities, no doubt with all these needs very muchin mind, have made an offer which would add  15 millions to the salarybill, I am glad to repeat that I should as Minister be ready to endorseproposals that would have this result:   but I must in fairness add that,so far as total cost is concerned, I should not be able to go any further.In that I entirely agree with them.8.      Now for my sole reservation about the authorities&apos; offer.   Thisconcerns the increase proposed at the minimum of the scale for new entrants to the profession.   In my view it is impossible to make anysufficient case for an increase at this point beyond a figure of  510representing an increase of just under l\ per cent over the minimum of 475 contained in the current report.   A minimum of  520 would,moreover, represent an increase of about 9jr per cent over the 1956figure or, to put it in another way, an increase of about 4 - per cent on top of the 5 per cent increase granted earlier this year.   If I were to approve an increase of this order, there is a real danger that it wouldbe taken to represent the Governmenfs view of what might be a-4-
reasonable increase over the wages field generally at this time.   this consideration applies particularly to the starting rate where directcomparison with industry and commerce is likely to be made.    For these reasons the Government have felt bound to conclude that they could notsanction proposals which brought the minimum of the basic scale to more than  510.9.      I imagine that you may well wish to let what I have told you todaybe publicly known at the right morosnt.    If that is your wish, I should behappy to agree with you how this could best be done.   In any case, myhope is that you will find some way of working out proposals for submission to me which, in the light of what I have told you, I should beable to approve.June, 1959-5-
