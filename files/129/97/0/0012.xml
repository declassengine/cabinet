secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S. government assistance FOR THE COTTON TEXTILE industry memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer -The scheme for assisting the cotton textile industry which is set out in thismemorandum reflects the views of the Ministerial Committee on the CottonIndustry. We have been able to reach a large measure of agreement: the two points where there is still some conflict of view are specifically mentioned inparagraphs 11 and 15.Principles of the Scheme2. We are agreed on the main principles of the proposed scheme, namely thatthere should be Government grants for the elimination of redundant capacity andfor re-equipment and modernisation. We are also agreed that legislation wouldbe necessary for these purposes.3.   The main objectives of the scheme are to use Government assistance-(a) to eliminate surplus capacity in the industry and thus accelerate the inevitable process of contraction;(b) to mitigate the hardship caused to both employers and workpeople bythis accelerated contraction;(c) to stimulate the re-equipment of that part of the industry which remainsafter the process of contraction has taken place.4. There are economic and social arguments in favour of the objectives at(a) and (b) above: the redundancy grants are designed to bring these about. Acompact and efficient industry would be a source of strength to the nation&apos;economy.5. The economic and social arguments in favour of seeking to achieve the objective at (c) above by means of re-equipment grants are much less compelling.Indeed, it can be argued that to offer the industry special re-equipment grants, after it has been given Government assistance to reduce itself to a more efficient size,betrays a lack of confidence in its future ability to stand on its own feet. Moreover,there are obvious dangers in the Government^ appearing to assume responsibilityfor determining the appropriate size of the industry: the possibility of redundancyoccurring again at a later date as a result of the grant-aided installation of new capacity cannot be excluded. If this were to happen, the Government wouldprobably be faced with further demands to organise a redundancy scheme. On theother hand, a scheme containing no provision for re-equipment grants wouldprobably be unacceptable to the industry, and its public presentation would bevery difficult. Critics would no doubt make considerable play of the fact that theGovernment were prepared to proffer assistance only for the truncation of theindustry: they would draw a sharp contrast between this particular policy andour general philosophy of economic expansion.   It is possible, too, that withoutPrinled for the Cabinet.   April 1959C. (59) 626th April, 1959Copy No.    5 9CABINET54981B
any assistance for re-equipment the industry will fail to modernise itself on thescale necessary to ensure its efficiency and survival. Grants for both redundancyand re-equipment would therefore make a more balanced and attractive package.But it is primarily on presentational and political grounds that provision forre-equipment is included in the scheme.6. Provided that the rates of grant are generous enough, there is reason toibelieve that a scheme on these lines will be acceptable to the industry. Whetherit*will be feasible to devise a scheme which will be both economically defensibleand will also command a positive welcome from Lancashire is another matter.7. We consider it unlikely that a scheme on these lines will have extensive andunwelcome repercussions on the two other main industries which are in processof contraction, namely shipbuilding and aircraft. The reasons for this view are set out in Annex A.Redundancy Grants8. We propose that Government grants should be available to meet a specified proportion of the costs of scrapping surplus capacity. The grants wouldbe payable for a limited period only: the precise period would need to be settled after further discussion with the industry. The Government would also have tobe satisfied id) as to the amount of scrapping which was aimed at;(b) that a minimum amount of scrapping would in fact take place; 1id) that the industry would contribute the remaining part of the cost, probablyj-n by means of a compulsory levy;id) about the rate of compensation to be paid for buying out the surplus capacity: it might perhaps take the form of fixed amounts per unitor be left to the discretion of the Agency within broad limits.; 9. The Government grants would relate to plant only. But there is alsothe problem of redundant workpeople. We are agreed that it would set a most undesirable precedent to relieve the industry of the responsibility for providingcompensation in this field. An essential prerequisite of the Government agreeing to pay redundancy grants would therefore be an undertaking that the industry would work out, and agree with the Trades Unions, the principles of a plan for making compensation payments to redundant workpeople; these payments wouldhave to be found by the industry. (It might be necessary to set up in due coursean ad hoc body to arbitrate on the details of such a plan. This should not,however, be mentioned to the industry at the present stage, since any prematurereference to the establishment of an arbitral body would open up the possibilityof dangerous repercussions elsewhere and might prejudice the chances of the two sides evolving a satisfactory plan.) We understand that the employers are reasonably confident about the possibility of working out an acceptablearrangement.10. These redundancy proposals would apply to all four sections of theindustry. In the case of the finishers, however, we are prepared to consider giving them a grant towards the cost of reorganisation other than scrapping: the finishersare thinking not only of scrapping, but also of reorganising their plant and machinery into fewer units: they are not asking for assistance towards re-equipment.11. The industry tentatively estimates that the cost of eliminating surplus capacity could be a maximum of  30 millions (this includes the cost of the finishers&apos;reorganisation plans). A figure of this order is however probably well on the highside. They have asked for a Government grant of 80 per cent. i.e., up to 24 millions. The President of the Board of Trade feels that they will probablyaccept a 66f per cent, grant, i.e., up to  20 millions. I do not feel able at the present stage, however, to agree to more than 50 per cent. i.e., up to  15 millions.Re-equipment Grants12. We propose that Government grants should be available to meet a specified proportion of the cost of re-equipment. This assistance would be providedfor the modernisation of existing equipment, as well as the installation of new
equipment: it would not, however, extend to buildings. It would be subject to thefollowing conditions:  (a) no grants would be payable on account of past re-equipment. This would tend to penalise the more efficient firms Who have already re-equippedthemselves out of their own resources: but their resentment would betempered to some extent by the fact that the inefficient elements in theindustry were being bought out; 1  &apos;!(b) the financial assistance would not become available until a reasonableminimum of scrapping either had taken place or was certain to takeplace under the arrangements for eliminating redundancy;(c) a time limit of, say, five years, after which no payments would be authorised.The aim should be to complete the job within the shortest practicabletime, and there should be power to bring the scheme to an end earlierif desirable.13. Re-equipment plans initiated after the scheme has been announced, but before it comes into operation, should be eligible for the grants.14. It is for consideration whether the grants should be payable only afterstringent criteria have been satisfied. For example, firms might be required tosubmit projects for which they are seeking grant assistance to a panel, whichwould need to satisfy itself that the proposals were technically sound and inaccordance with the accepted best practices of the industry. This might providea useful weapon to instil a more progressive attitude into the industry and toimprove its technical quality: there is ample room for this. On the other hand,there might be difficulties in manning such panels with suitable experts; and somefirms might be reluctant to disclose their projects to bodies on which representativesof their competitors might be serving. Furthermore, the industry might wellresent detailed examination of the technical soundness of projects for which they themselves were contributing by far the greater part of the finance.15. The industry tentatively estimate the total Cost of re-equipment at amaximum of  80 millions. They have asked for a 50 per cent. Government grant(with a measure of retrospection in the case of the weavers) and also for loans at government rates of interest: this has probably influenced their estimated figure,which is clearly very high. We are agreed that special loans are out of the question.As regards the rate of grant, the President of the Board of Trade wishes to offer25 per cent., costing up to  20 millions, which he feels is the lowest likely to be acceptable to the industry in the absence of special loan facilities. I do not feel able, however, at present to go beyond 20 per cent. This would cost up to 16 millions spread over five years.Taxation points16. The industry have made two proposals for discriminatory tax relief,namely:  (i) exemption from tax of redundancy grants;(ii) exemption from the specified provisions of existing tax law that any government subsidy towards capital expenditure is deducted from theamount of investment on which capital allowances are due.17. We are agreed that there are compelling arguments against acceptingthese. Our reasons are set out in Annex B.18. It can be expected that payments made by the industry under anycompulsory levy for a redundancy scheme which has been certified by the Boardof Trade would rank for taxation relief.The Agency19. An Agency will need to be set up to supervise and operate the scheme.Its precise status and composition in particular, its relationship with theGovernment and with the Cotton Board will need further consideration afterconsultations with the industry. We are agreed, however, that it should be at oneremove from the Government, but should be subject to any necessary control by54981
the Treasury and the Board of Trade. If it is decided that re-equipment projectsmust be scrutinised before they qualify for grant, it might be necessary to set upsub-committees or panels for each of the four sections of the industry. These would need to be manned by experts: it might be desirable to include on themrepresentatives of the appropriate Research Associations.Legislation20. The Government will need to assure the industry that the necessary legislation to set up the scheme will be introduced. Such an assurance, however,would be conditional on the industry accepting the scheme and on the government being satisfied with the industry&apos;s own proposals, as revised in the light of it.21. The legislation may be controversial and, if it is to be enacted this summer, instructions will need to be given to Parliamentary Counsel by early May.The nature of the Bill, and the possibility of fitting it into the existing legislative programme without disruption, will need further consideration.22. In reaching decisions on the timing of the legislation, much will clearlyturn on domestic political plans. The following possibilities can be envisaged, indescending order of attraction:  (i) to enact a Bill this summer;(ii) to introduce a Bill and let it fall if there is a Dissolution;(iii) to announce the scheme, coupling with it an assurance that it is the government&apos;s intention to introduce the necessary legislation in a futureParliament.Procedure23. If a scheme on the above lines is approved it will be necessary, before making any public announcement, to have further consultations with representativesof the industry both to secure their general reactions to the scheme and to discuss with them a number of detailed points.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,3rd April, 1959.
Annex AREPERCUSSIONS ON THE SHIPBUILDING AND aircraft industries&apos; . .Shipbuilding. There are big differences between conditions in this and thecotton industry. Shipbuilding is suffering mainly from the difficulties of shipping and can be expected to benefit when the latter revives. Nor is there any need forthe industry to contract, though there is a good deal of inefficiency in it and widespread restrictive practices. It would probably not be easy to sustain a case for Government aid for re-equipment and difficult to ask for aid to eliminateredundancy. On the whole there would not seem to be serious danger of provokingembarrassing demands for Government assistance.2. Aircraft. The main point here is that the Government is already givingmassive assistance, both directly and indirectly, and it is unlikely that the industry could use any support the Government might give to cotton to justify a demandfor additional assistance. The aircraft industry needs to contract and reorganiseitself; but there is no reason to believe that it needs re-equipping on any large scaleor that the necessary contraction will not come about. All these factors differentiateit from the cotton industry and make it unlikely that aid to the latter would leadto pressure for similar action for the aircraft industry that could not be effectivelyresisted.Annex BTAXATION CONCESSIONSTwo of the taxation concessions for which the industry have asked are : -(i) exemption from tax of redundancy grants;(ii) exemption from the specified provision of existing tax law that any government subsidy towards capital expenditure is deducted from theamount of investment on which capital allowances are due.2. There are very serious objections to any form of discriminatory tax relief.This apart, the provisions of tax law, both regarding compensation receipts andregarding the treatment of subsidies for the purpose of capital allowances, werespecifically directed towards the sort of situation now envisaged in the cottonindustry.3. As regards (i), to exempt compensation receipts from tax is likely to leadto excessive tax relief, first, because any loss to which taxable compensation is related will be taken into account in settling taxation liabilities and, secondly,because to some extent the compensation may represent refunding of a contribution which gets tax relief.4. Exemption as at (ii) would mean that the trader would have allowed fortaxation purposes more than he actually spent on his equipment; and it would thusrepresent a concealed addition to the subsidy in an uncertain amount depending on the taxation position of the recipient. It would in any case hardly seem possibleto treat subsidies for the cotton industry in a different way from other subsidies inrelation to taxation.April, 1959.
