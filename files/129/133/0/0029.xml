DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY ?S GOVERNMENT)Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Annex to this paper sets out for my colleagues the presentsituation in South Arabia.    The synopsis of recent events in its firsteight paragraphs shows that the ramshackle arrangements inheritedfrom our predecessors have collapsed, despite our efforts to make them work and to improve them    The territory ha.s since earlySeptember been held together precariously by the South Arabian Forces,,They themselves however feel the strain of continued divisions amongthe factions?  there has been marked deterioration in the position in thisrespect over the last ten days.2,       My colleagues will recall that our previous decisions on thedate of independence were taken on finely balanced calculations ofmaintaining the confidence of the South Arabians in the face of theUnited Arab Republic (UAR)&apos;s occupation in the Yemen, and getting theFederal forces ready to cope with a situation affected by that*    Thesituation in the Yemen has changed.    The UAR are firmly committed towithdrawals  they have evacuated Taiz and Ss,na and expect to have withdrawn entirely by mid-December,    Simultaneously the nature ofpolitical conflict in South Arabia has been transformed by the collapse of the Federal Government    That collapse has not however been followed by the emergence of an administration ready tc deal with us asyet0    The continued absence of such an administration, and the failureso far of the revolutionary factions to agree on one in their belated talks- ::-&apos;f9pHHHin Cairo, are creating a progressively more dangerous situation.    Inthese circumstances, the High Commissioner and the Commander-in-Chief have now strongly recommended that we must declare independence and evacuate our forces in November and not wait till January,    Evenif things get better rather than worse meanwhile, the risk of renewedconflict involving our forces outweighs what small chance there might otherwise be, if we waited till January, of a political settlementembodying some of the arrangements normal to our decolonisation.We must I think concentrate on completing our military withdrawal anddisengaging in the least onerous fashion possible.    Our power to imposesolutions v/as always slight.    Only in Aden State, and in some islandswith a total population of less than 400, have we had sovereignty,    Wehave never had legal or other power to impose patterns or solutionselsewhere in South Arabia.    And in present circumstances there isC(67) 169COPY NO.26th October. 1967CABINETSOUTH ARABIA
neither possibility of,, nor vital interest in, doing this.    The only coursewe can follow is to leave the Arabs to settle their own differences, whilesupporting and seeking to maintain influence with the South Arabianforces, and to assume responsibility for terminal matters only where weboth can and most,3o       Correspondingly all previous decisions are open to review.These are the date of independence and final withdrawal of 9th january and the offer of deterrent forces (C(67) 7S)j  our basic decisions in1966 on military and economic assistance after independence andour supplementary offers of June., 1967.     Our aid programmes havekept South Arabia viable and her forces together and have   thusso far avoided a breakdown which v/ould hamper our withdrawal.?the logistic withdrawal will be over by ;jiid-November.     it is too soon to say if they will succeed in the second objective (over which we were always less optimistic) of leaving behind a viablestability.     This will depend on political developments and also on South Arabians ability to raise or borrow money over and above whatever assistance we decide to provide (which at its previouslevel was to be considerably less than the resources which have been available to-her in recent years)04.       The UAR!s withdrawal from the Yemen reduces our major concern about future stability,,    But we still need to minimise the damage becauseof possible repercussions In the Persian Gulf and our relations with king Faisal.    The King always considered that the Defence Previewdecisions and all that followed amounted to the abandonment of friends and the prejudice of his interests.    He Is highly critical now.    We want to reduce this damage, and also to reduce the danger that his owninclinations and the urgings of former Federal leaders in South Arabiacould lead him to act In ways that would increase the difficulties there.I am acting with the Saudis to make the position and our approach to itabsolutely clear.5,       I summarise below some recommendations and conclusions whichare fully set out at Annex,(a) I recommend that my colleagues should leave me discretion,in consultation as necessary and according to developmentssto decide on any date of independence and withdrawal aftermid-November, 1967 (which may be as early as 22nd November),and to announce next week that we are leaving in the second halfof November (paragraphs 9 and 16-18).    I deal with public presentation below.    We should have to accept the likelihood that we might be unable to promote a political settlement before our departure (paragraphs 23 and 24).(b) I recommend that the offer of deterrent naval and air forcesmade in June, 1967 should be cancelled (paragraph 19).    TheHigh Commissioner agrees that this is right and I am consultinghim on the terms of the announcement.
I recommend that I be allowed latitude to decide later whether weshould adhere to our decision to offer Hunter aircraft andassociated radar to increase the strength originally planned for the South Arabian Air Force (paragraphs 20-22)3  and toauthorise the High Commissioner to attempt to secure theagreement of the South Arabian forces to the withdrawal ofthe Hunters on the basis that we should instead build the south arabian Air Force to a total strength of 12 Jet Provosts/BAG 167 aircraft rathex- than eight in partial compensation,,The High Commissioner is against cancelling the Hunters, atleast at this point, but suggests he cculd attempt to secure agreement if we can make this substitute offer.    The Secretaryof State for Defence would also be concerned at the effect onthe security of our final evacuation if we were, against theSouth Arabian Army!s wishes, to remove the Hunter aircraft,,Because it is unlikely that any successor government will before independence bring into force the satisfactory Nationality Lawthe Federal Government had enacted but not brought into force,I recommend that an Order in Council should be made bringingthat Nationality Law into force for the inhabitants of the whole country,,    This may enable (but would not oblige) the HomeSecretary to make an Order depriving up to 80^ 000 people in aden who have no connection with the United Kingdom of thecitizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies and of the exemption from the Commonwealth Immigrants Act with whichthey might otherwise be left (paragraphs 29 and 30).I recommend that,, if no better arrangement can be made, weshould assume responsibility for the pensions and otherterminal benefits which would normally be the responsibilityof the successor government for expatriate public servants,both British and others, provided that the others do not come under the &quot;indigenous&quot; classification in the existing PublicService Regulations which distinguishes purely local civilservants of various races from expatriates (paragraphs 31-36).I ask my colleagues to take note that supplies of military equipment arranged under the programme of June, 1966continue, and that I have not suggested a decision now againstprovision of any of the supplementary equipment;, except asindicated above Hunter aircraft and radar, which was offered   .in June, 196? (paragraphs 10 and 11)0    The reason in both cases is that it is essential not at present further to disturb theSouth Arabian forces on whom the present precarious stabilitydepends.    Delivery of the supplementary items of June, 1967is not imminenta    Decisions will have to be taken later(paragraph 11).I suggest to my colleagues that we cannot at present, againbecause of the effect on the South Arabian forces, take andannounce decisions on the financial subventions for militaryand civil ptirposes after independence which we had decided upon earlier,, or on the Military Advisory and Training Missionwhich we offered in June, 1967.    I think the main party of thelatter will have to remain at notice to proceed, as now planned,from early November even if we are doubtful whether it will prove appropriate.    Our public line should be that such matters are for discussion with the successor regime (paragraphs 25-27).
(h) I ask my colleagxies to note that I am doing what is possible toimpose close control on current expenditure (paragraph 12),(i) I ask rny colleagues to take note that there is virtually no chanceof the United Nations agreeing to the internationalisatioa ofPerim under their auspices while we remain resisonsiblo,  andto take note of my decisions on the islands, including theretrocession of the Kuria Muria islands to the Sultanate of muscat and Oman (paragraphs 13-15).6.       We may have a difficult passage in Parliament,,    The mainattack will doubtless be that the course of events was precipitated bythe decisions in the Defence Preview and that our subsequent measures were inadequate to compensate for this,    I propose to take the general line foreshadowed in the first half of rny speech of 19th June.    I includedit as a precaution against the kind of situation we now face.    We canargue that we made it plain enough at that time that the proposalsannounced that day were designed to redress a deteriorating situation arising above all from the unsound basis of British policy in south arabia before we took office.    They also took account of the positionas I have sketched it at the beginning of paragraph 2 above.,    We can take the line&apos;that the position has entirely changed, but (assuming nocollapse meanwhile) that our support of the forces has been amplyjustified because these have prevented disintegration, and have in anycase held things together over much of the last phase of our withdrawal.So far as matters nevertheless remain difficult and unpredictable, thishowever only emphasises that the logic of our basic analysis on19th June should now be followed, and that we should as soon as possibleleave the Arabs to sort out their own problems without the complicationof our military presence.    We can justify an advanced date of independence, should we decide on this, on three main grounds.    First,the revolutionary upheaval has transformed the context in which wemust deal.    Secondly, there is no evidence that we-could achieveanything usefuls to the Arabs or ourselves, by staying longer.Thirdly^ the problem has relapsed to local proportions with the departure of the Egyptians from the Yemen, and is no longer one inwhich outside powers should remain to play a part.    WhereParliamentary replies or statements have to be made before final decisions are announced, we should take the line that we awaitdiscussions with the emergent regime.Foreign Office, S.W.1,,25th October, 1967
SOUTH ARABIARECE.FT,EVENTSAs our troops withdrew from the hinterland toAden in preparation for their final evacuation,  armeddissidence and genuine or opportunist sympathy with it caused the various Sultanic state administrationsprogressively to fall in the period between the endof July and the middle of September,,   The FederalSupreme Council disappeared with this.Continuing instability2.      This is not however revolution under central control.    The National Liberation Front (N.L.P.)established firm control in about two-thirds of theFederation.    Various elements grouped under the labelof the Front for the Liberation of Occupied SouthYemen (.FLOSY) gained ascendancy in two or perhapsthree states.    The two groupings, sometimes violentlyand sometimes in uneasy truce, continue to contestfor supremacy in some places, particularly in thearea Northern Aulaqi/Wahidi.    In Aden Suate itselfsympathies are divided.    The NLF were the first ofthe two organisations to seize the opportunity in theEastern Protectorate.    Though at first it seemed thatFLOSY might resist them there, the NLF seem now to beconsolidating their control of both the Kathiri andthe Qaiti States,  and it seems that the Mahra state is going the same way.3o      The picture is complicated by the underlyingfactional and tribal factors which have alwaysbedevilled South Arabia.    The fact that one or otherextremist organisation appears to have the allegianceof the people in a given area often reflects trad-itional feuds or divisions rather than politicalconviction in the modern sense.    The downfall of theSultans as the central regime is no doubt permanent.Their eclipse in their own states may not in all cases be.    With most of the former Sultans in refuge inSaudi Arabia,  there has been real risk that some ofthem may try to mount counter coups from Yemeniterritory (either Royalist or Republican controlled)and a risk that the Saudis may involve themselves inthis.    The High Commissioner at Aden,  and I throughthe Embassy at Jedda, have done all v/e could to limitthis risk and so far have avoided serious trouble inrelation to it./ External influencesANNEX
External influences1+.     The inter-relation of domestic and external Arabfactors has changed considerably,    Prom late 1966 itwas obvious that the NLF was gaining ground.    Havinglost Egyptian backing in 1965/66 it benefitted fromappearing genuinely South Arabian by comparison withFLOSY.    The latter, drawing its strength primarilyfrom Aden and largely from Yemenis in Aden, could notmatch the NLF&apos;s gunmen;    lost control of the tradeunion movement in Aden; and progressively weakenedon its own ground of Aden as its significant leadersstayed or fled abroad.    Its base eroded further as many of its Yemeni supporters left Aden as our forcesran down, and as economic life stultified in the prevailing conditions.    Recognising this, we never-theless thought earlier that the longer term positionof the two organisations might be reversed if the egyptians stayed in the Yemen and FLOSY retained itsexternal backing.    The Egyptians, however, needingSaudi money and conceivably under Soviet pressure,are leaving the Yemen and their withdrawal will almost certainly be complete by mid-December of this year.Further weakened by this, FLOSY sought de factotactical alliance not only with the Egyptians, butalso with the Saudis (who mistrust it, but prefer itto the NLF, which they regard as extreme left-wing)and some elements of the former Federal regime, notablyamong the Aulaqis who see temporary advantage in assuming a FLOSY label and think of counter-coups intheir home States.    The NLF&apos;s political inspiration,so far as it is not its own, comes from the ArabNationalist Movement (MM) in the Levant and in Kuwait,who are distant, whereas Yemeni territory and theSaudis are close.    There is a general predisposition,irrespective of regime, to think of &quot;Arab socialism&quot;.It is still not certain therefore that the NLF willremain dominant.    If FLOSY and the NLF do not get together, and if the NLF weaken, FLOSY are unlikely to supplant them more than partially;    and the most likely consequence would then be disintegration.Economic position.     The economy and administration are in parlouscondition.    The inevitable fall in employment and income as the base ran down was serious but, assumingour continued support, not necessarily critical.    Butthe economic activity of the Port of Aden, the onlymajor source of earnings, has come to virtual stand-still.    Terrorism and political strikes were followedby the closure of the Suez Canal and the Arab oilboycott.    This for a time virtually paralysed the BPRefinery which exists primarily for bunkering,  is/ Aden-2-
Aden State&apos;s major source of tax revenue, and is atpresent operating at about 60% of normal levels onchanged patterns of business.   Finally the revolution-ary upheaval followed.   Where taxes or customs dues(e.g. at the Yemen frontier) should have been levied,they either were not or, in many cases, were looted bydissidents.    This is being partially remedied in some places but by no means all.    Saudi financial help willnot be forthcoming in immediate circumstances.Terrorism and systematic intimidation have over thelast two years eroded the civil service, Arab evenmore than British.    Things are momentarily easier forFederal civil servants during the present lull;    butthe State administrations were disrupted and the re-establishment of these now in progress in some states is by no means complete.Role of the South Arabian armed forces6e     Complete disintegration may have beenpreventedby the South Arabian armed forces, but their ownloyalties have been deeply divided and so far theyhave been able to take little positive action.    Theirsympathies are in general more with the NLF than withFLOSY.    This was however sharply modified through thetendency of both officers and men to follow tribalalignments, which caused several senior officers toswing towards FLOSY under the lead of the formerrulers of Aulaqi country (paragraph k above).    Therehave been at least three cases of battalion commandersacting in partisan interest or espousing this - inBaihan for the NLF and in Wahidi and Little Aden forFL0SYo    Realising that this trend could split theirown ranks and bring complete chaos, the officersresolved to refuse political power themselves while continuing to try to hold the ring between the twonationalist factions,  to press these to reconciletheir differences sufficiently for joint negotiation with the High Commissioner, and to urge him to appealto the factions accordingly.   With our agreement heissued a statement on 5 September,  saying that theFederal Government had ceased to function, that the&quot;nationalists&quot; had established their representativeposition and that he was ready to negotiate terminalissues with them.    The South Arabian Forces alsosucceeded in enforcing almost unbroken truce for somesix weeks in Aden, from which our forces and thewithdrawal operation benefitted, and to a lesser extent among the factions up-country.    Over the last ten days it has partially broken down in Aden andhas threatened to do so up-country./ The latestiti-3- &apos;
ffhe_lat.est position7.      The S011th Arabian Array gave the factions two weeks to come together -for&quot; negotiation with the HighCommissioner, hut after ove*? q month, they have still not agreed on a common front.    The depth of theirdivisions, their scattered leadership and inadequateorganisation and their uncertain control are obvious reasons.    Another is personalities:    the NLF would deal, on terms, with Makkawi but try not to deal withAsnag.    In addition FLOSY, weak on the ground yetstill claiming larger say than the NLF, and the NLFhoping to complete the defeat of FLOSY, have bothhad an interest in playing for time to see whetherintrigue and outside backing can redress theirsituation (paragraph h above).    The Saudis, deter-mined to check the NLF and if possible an NLF/FLOSYcombination excluding others,  got the Egyptians toagree with them to impose a formula for a caretakergovernment on the basis of 5 each for FLOSY and theNLF, 3 for the now ineffective South Arabian league and 3 for &quot;others&quot;  (clearly Sultanic nominees). Onlynow have FLOSY and the NLF - the latter with manifestreservations - agreed to negotiations between thera-selves under President Nasser&apos;s auspices in Cairo.The formula above was rejected by both FLOSY and theNLF.    The outcome remains uncertain so that, two anda half months before our declared date for independence of 9 January, we have none to negotiate with.    Thedelay increases the strains on the South Arabianforces and the likelihood that they may disintegrateor, worse,  join in internecine trouble and thus leavethe territory to chaos.    Their senior officers haveavoided backing one fafition and taking over themselvesbecause either course would split their own ranks.There is now a greater danger of that split becauseof NLF moves against FLOSY in Aulaqi country whichwere only prevented with difficulty.United Nations8.      In July, the United Nations Mission had finallysucceeded in talking to FLOSY in New York after wehad made repeated efforts for over five months to persuade FLOSY to meet the Mission.    FLOSY stillrefused to talk to Lord Caradon.    The Mission thenwent to Geneva in the hope of gathering all factionstogether at last.    In the event however onlyrepresentatives of the States, whom they had at lastconsented to see, and of Aden turned up (indeed theabsence of too many Federal personalities in Genevamay have been a minor factor in the Federal rulers&apos;easy overthrow).    The Mission then moved to Beirutand Cairo for a further effort to see FLOSY,and if/ possible
sipossible the NLF who had continued to reject theMission&apos;s belated overtures.    The High Commissionerkept the Mission informed of developments,  and warned the Mission at the end of August in a personal messagethat the situation was being transformed.    When it became necessary for him to make his statement of5 September, Lord Shackleton flew to Beirut to explainwhat was happening before the statement was broadcastthe same evening.    The Mission reacted adversely.Ignoring the time factor, and despite our continuousefforts earlier to keep them informed, they complainedperversely of lack of consultations and the Afghanmember,  in particular, took an extremely hostile lineaccusing us of conspiracy with the NLF as well as wrongpolicy in the past.    The Mission are now in New Yorktrying to complete their report but delayed in this bythe absence of their Malian member and their feeling that they must not, by publication, prejudice NLF/FLOSY negotiations.   The report is bound to be critical of HMO though what particular line it will take or what recommendations it may make we do not know.    LordCaradon,  and the High Commissioner in regular messages,are doing their best to keep the Mission informed andreasonably equable.INTERIM POLICYMilitary Planning9.      I agreed with the Secretary of State for defence that while a changed date of independence would haveto be considered &quot;between us collectively, the Commander-^-in-Chief must be authorised to submit plans foraccelerated withdrawal.    This he has done.    The plansinvolve the movement however of 7*000 men, most of themby air, a major commitment of Air Support Command andsome rearrangement of charter aircraft.    The presentposition is that orderly withdrawal could be completed by 22 November provided a decision is taken and can berevealed to air charter companies etc. by, at thelatest, 2 November.    There is a strong feeling,emphasised by both the High Commissioner and theCommander-in-Chief, that the marked deterioration in both Aden and the Protectorate over the last few days,including signs that the strains may be becoming too great for the Arab forces&apos;  precarious unity, make it essential to get out not later than the end of NovemberaThe alternative in their view is that orderly and peaceful withdrawal might become impossible.// Support of the Arab forces-5-
Support, of the Arab forces10.    The High Commissioner represented strongly thatwe should do nothing to reduce the cohesion of theSouth Arabian forces,  or to suggest that we couldcease to support them now and after independence.They would certainly disintegrate (but retaining theirweapons) if they thought their pay was stopping.    this applied equally to the Hadhrami Beduin Legion (HBL)in the Eastern Aden Protectorate (EAP), whose rolethere had been comparable with that of the forces inthe Federation.    I agree, but this means that somedecisions we may take now cannot he revealed and thatwe shall have to stonewall on future support for sometime in Parliament and elsewhere.11o    We naturally suspended deliveries of military equipment (by administrative action made easier to conceal by the Canal&apos;s closure)  in September.    Butthe High Commissioner recommended on 19 and 20September, for the reasons in the foregoing paragraph,that we should maintain delivery of all weapons,including aircraft and small arms, which in his vie?/and the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s would not be a threat toour forces in our remaining time.    The deliveriesimmediately affected all arise from the programme ofJune 1966 and the expenditure is committed and in large degree made.    They include the aircraft requiredto make the South Arabian Air Force in part operation-al before the end of November.    The arms which couldbe a threat to us, and which the High C ommissionerwants supplied but not actually delivered, come underthe supplementary programme of 1967 which the Federalforces have only belatedly indented for but expect.They are the additional Saladins, the additional25-pounder guns and the self-loading riflesa    Inarguing that full procurement of material, includingthese, should proceed, the High Commissioner maintainsthat even after the immediate need to maintainconfidence during our withdrawal has passed, we snail stillfind it in our interest after independence to maintaininfluence with the forces by maintaining the fullsupply programme, and argues that we would not wantRussian supply in lieu.    The forces will still bethe key to any stability, and we should have interestin keeping in with them.    He sees no advantage in a middle course between the full programme and thecomplete cancellation which, he allows, might wellfollow a collapse of the forces and the disintegrationof the territory./ Financial Control-6-
F i nan c i al^Gcntr o 112.    The disintegrations the financial situation andthe progressive administrative deterioration eince1965 have made it essential to take abnormal actionover financeo    In general terms my department and theMinistry of Overseas Development have proposed iffeasible to draw a line under Colonial Development and welfare schemes which finance some Federal recurrent expenditure and, in consultation with the HighCommissioner, to control expenditure as rigorouslyas possible &quot;by short-term instalments of the block grant which supports the Federal/State budgetsincluding the finance of the forces.   We are alsotaking what action we can to compose correct accounts,since the full audit (well after a given financialyear) which would normally be available to the public accounts Committee will clearly now be impossible;records are already in some cases beyond our officials&apos;access.The South Arahian Islands13.    The United Nations Mission deprecated our proposal of the internationalisation of Perim as oneoutside the terms of reference laid down for themby the United Nations resolutions.    Their report may also condemn the proposal;      the Fourth Committeecertainly will, as the Arab delegations at New Yorkalready have.    That will kill the proposal (thoughexactly when within this Assembly we do not yet know)and I shall Inform Parliament accordingly in due course.We are left with the demand in the United Nationsresolutions that Kamaran, Perim and -the Kuria Muriaislands be incorporated in South Arabia:    and ourwarning to the United Nations and our undertaking toParliament that the wishes of the inhabitants mustbe taken into account (this of course is consistent with our line over Gibraltar,  the Falkland islands and comparable issues.)11+.    I have decided that we must, as the &quot;administrativepower&quot; do what seems right and best from all points ofview.    I have told the High Commissioner to attempt tocover the need for consultation by informing theinhabitants of Perim and Kamaran (subject to the outcome of the internationalisation proposal in theformer case) that they should remain with Aden;    andby informing the inhabitants of the Kuria Murias thatthey should regert to the suzerainty of the Sultan of muscat and Oman.    The consultation process is designedto give the islanders full opportunity to object andwill ensure that a representative reaction is obtained.I expect Perim to opt for South Arabia and thusconstitute no problem.    Kamaran has not been formallyproclaimed a protectorate;    we simply remained in/ control-7-
control after World War I.    In these circumstances,we can simply leave while informing the United nations of the wishes of the inhabitants.    In neither case isthe course we propose to the islanders likely to stimulate a reaction at variance from the united nations resolutions,  and there should be no difficultybetween Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the United nations in these cases.    If the Yemen should subsequentlyclaim Perim or Kamaran that will no longer be ourproblem.15.    The Kuria Murias&apos;  case will cause complaint fromthe United Nations and &quot;nationalists&quot;, who willcomplain of departure from the United Nations resolution-contributions and dislike anything favouring the Sultan of muscat.    But we must act positively over the KuriaMuria Islands,  since we have sovereignty there.    Theywere a gift from Muscat 113 years ago.    The fewmainland connexions of their 78 inhabitants are withthe Sultanate of Muscat and Oman.    The patois is akinto that on the nearby mainland, not that spoken in eastern South Arabia.    The ohly connexion with south arabia has been an administrative convenience ofsubordination to the Governor of Aden.    The islandsare some 20/hO miles from the Sultanate and some 200miles from South Arabia.    It is entirely right theyshould revert to Muscat and Oman.    Our interest in good relations with the Sultan continues, whereas wehave little interest in future relations with south arabia.    Consultation will undoubtedly yield theinhabitants&apos; request for reversion to the Sultan of muscat.    I propose to arrange this by agreement withhim, and to inform the United Nations.    Eventualcomplaint from the United Nations would be unfoundedand must be accepted.MAJOR DECISIONS REQUIREDT he jia te^ jpf,, Ind e v end e n c e16.    The truce sought by the South Arabian Army and,on the whole, tacitly maintained until recently by thefactions has given our forces a breathing space.Within Aden State,  the South Arabian Forces have taken over Little Aden, and the Shaikh Othman/Mansura area.Like the NLF who dominate Little Aden,  they have showndetermination to safeguard the BP refinery, a considerableBritish investment.    At the other extreme and in the worst case, there might be a resumption of terroristactivity with elements of the Forces siding withterrorist groups against both other groups and ourselvesusing the heavy weapons/of the Forces and those thefactions have acquired (paragraph 9 above).    The HighCommissioner, who is now strongly in favour of early/ withdrawal-8-
withdrawal lia.cs ro^omm*md^cl that we should still maintainas much flexibility between 90 and 30 November as the difficult situation allows.    Taking into account thelatter half of November as the time of partial opera-tional readiness by the South Arabian Air Force, he andthe Commander-in-Chief have made strong recommendations that:(a) We fix independence and withdrawal of lastmilitary elements by 22 November;(b) We announce by 31 October that we are leavingin the second half of November; and(c) We decide by 13 November whether the date at(a) should become 30 November.    This allows an extra 8 days for the beginning of negotiationsif a caretaker body emerges meanwhile(negotiations which the future Embassy could continue after independence).17.    The first objective of our policy has been to getour forces out in good order.    That;, already largelyachieved, can be completed on the foregoing basis by22 November.    But there are other problems on which we.should attempt to start negotiation if a new governmentemerges in time for this, and if other conditions are notunfavourable18.    In these circumstances I recommend:(a) that I should have discretion, in consultation as necessary and according to developments, todecide on any date of independence after midrNovember 1967 (which may be as early as22 November); that I should decide finally by13 November whether to make this date30 November; and that we should now announce that independence will be in the latter halfof November.    Independence would be broughtabout by an Order in Council under the Aden,Perim and Kuria Muria Islands Act of 1967terminating British sovereignty; simultaneousRoyal Proclamations ending British protectionover the protected territories of South Arabia;and other terminal action required consistently with this;(b) that we should inform the High Commissioner and commander-in-Chief immediately of our decision,D-gterrent forces19.    Even if we should decide to support the successorregime after independence, the changes within south arabia and the UAR&apos;s withdrawal from the Yemen make themaintenance of our offer of deterrent units unnecessaryfor the purposes originally conceived ( 0PD( 67)1+5 ) , while there is no question of involving ourselves after/independence-9-
independence against attacks over the &quot;border by ex-Sultans or even the Yemeni republicans.    The HighCommissioner agrees.    I therefore recommends(a) that the stationing of V-Bombers at Masirahshould now be cancelled;(b) that the deterrent task of the naval force should now be cancelled but that the force should, with any modifications of compositionappropriate, continue to assemble to covercontingencies around and after the time of independence for a limited period.I remain in consultation with the High Commissioner- aboutinforming the South Arabians,    Subject to this I would expect to inform the House as soon as necessary.Hunter aircraft^and radar20.    Our decision this year to offer 8 Hunter aircraft and associated radar (OPD(67)^5) in addition to the 8 light ground attack aircraft decided on in 1966(OPD(66)62) must be reconsidered.    The Hunters and radarare already in Aden as part of the Royal Air Force; wehad decided to transfer them on independence.    The HighCommissioner says that he might be able in due course to persuade the South Arabian Defence Ministry that this equipment is unnecessary in present circumstances andwould be a heavy drain on the South Arabians&apos; limited resources.    He asks however that we should for thepresent at least adhere to our decision to supply.    to change it could in his view cause adverse reactions amongthe South Arabian forces.    He does not believe that itwould be in our interest (or the Saudis&apos; interest) togive up the close relationship with the South Apabian army which the provision of supplies and personnel will in his view make it possible to continue.    If we do not supplyall the equipment we have promised, he considers it probable that the Russians will do so and might in thisparticular case substitute MiO 17s with East Europeanpilots.    He argues that the South Arabian Army will stillneed at least the level of armaments which we had proposed for the defence of the country, and in particu-lar for the control of dissident movements, in view ofthe large quantities of sophisticated arms which are invarious hands in the country.   As stated above, he doesnot think that there is a middle course between supply-ing as planned and ceasing support entirely.    Hislatest statement is that he would/be-1 0-
be prepared to tackle the South Arabian Armynow on reconaidering the Hunters, but only if wecan authorise him to say that we will provide fouradditional Jet Provosts instead (see paragraph 22 below).21.    The arguments against this are theses -(a) In 1966 Middle East Command refused tosupport the bid for Hunters and radar becausethey thought it too complex a defence system forthe South Arabians to manage.    We disregarded this in June this year because of the need to instillconfidence in the face of the UAR threat In the yemen.    That threat is however now disappearing.(b) The equipment, now owned by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment,  is worth about  1.05 million and therecurrent annual cost of Its maintenance and operation was estimated at  0.825 million.(c) We have several potential customers for theHunter aircraft and can earn both foreign exchange and good will by selling them.(d) The., inevitable increases in the costs of thewhole programme together with emergency deliveryarrangements enforced by the closure of the Canalmean as things stand at present that we must find some  300,000 of savings within the programme toremain within the ceilings my colleagues have authorised.(e) There must be some doubt about the,,politicalutility of supplying the forces of a state which,If it survives, may well be hostile to Saudi arabia and Muscat-;    but this can be argued both ways.22.    I am reluctant at this point to  advise any decision which would override the High Commissioner^ view of what he needs to do his very difficult short-term job.    TheSecretary of State for Defence would also be concerned atthe effect on our final evacuation if we were to angerthe South Arabian forces by removing the aircraft against those forces&apos; wishes just before independence.    i therefore recommend:(a) that my colleagues leave me latitude, inconsultation as necessary, to take a decisionon the Hunter aircraft and the radar later and;(b) that I should also authorise the HighCommissioner to inform the South Arabians of withdrawl of the Hunter offer at a time of hischoosing,  provided he can offer to leavepermanently k &apos;&quot;stop-gap&apos;: Jet Provosts instead./These
These are in any case due for delivery in december to tide over the period until the South Arabian AirForce complement of 8 light let aircraft can be fully operational.    This would mean 12 light jet aircraft instead of 8,  in substitution for 8 lightjet aircraft and 8 Hunters,(c) That should we eventually decide againstsupplying the Hunter aircraft without the agreementof the South Arabian forces, any intimation orannouncement of this should,   subject to the HighCommissioner^ judgment9 be as late as possible sothat it cannot damage our reliance on the south arabian forces, who might well react adversely,  tocover our withdrawal.    The announcement could be delayed-   till the time of the aircraft&apos;s removal,which I understand can be delayed until a week or so before independence.(d) that alternative potential customers cannot yet be told of any change;(e) that we refrain from stating the position toAirwork (whose operating contract with the federal government has not yet been expanded to cover theHunters) but find ways administratively,withoutreason stated,  to ensure that they do not incuravoidable expenditure in relation to the Hunteraircraft and radar in the period before we can tell them that these   may. not be involved.I should explain,  over (e),  that air work were given an assurance some months ago, by agreement between myDepartment and the Treasury, that if their contractualarrangements with the South Arabian Government broke down for reasons beyond th.ir control I would considerfavourably recommending to Parliament that theirreasonable and proper irrecoverable expenditure be reimbursed.    This would of course be very much cheaperthan financing the programme as planned.PoJLitical^23.    The best arrangement conceivable in presentcircumstances is an agreement with a representative group,if possible including elements other than the NLF andFLOSY and with the backing of the South Arabian forces,under which they would assume responsibility for theentire territory.    There is no chance of bringing intoeffect the revised constitution which the federal government had been about to introduce.    The best we can hope for on the constitutional side is that the participants should undertake to respect the essentialsafeguards of human rights and laws provided to Aden inthe present Aden State constitution or the abortive draft/Federal-12-
Federal constitution until such time as more durablearrangements can be worked out (perhaps with united nations assistance).    An indication of respect forthe Universal Declaration on Human Rights could alsobe sought.    I have it in mind,  as soon as a relatively-favourable outcome of this kind emerges, to act tosecure international recognition and United Nationsmembership for the new regime.    This of course wouldalso lay some basis for economic aid, whether bilateralor multilateral and from the Specialised Agencies which,in due course, might ease decisions on reducing or endingour own subventions,2h.    The worst likely outcome is an unresolved or evenchaotic situation in which we had to leave the territory to the de facto authorities even if divided among themselves, perhaps handing over Aden State to themilitary authorities immediately controlling it    or, ifthey refuse responsibility, simply leaving.    We have after all no responsibility for regulating the Federation exceptin so far as our responsbility for Aden has become involved with this.    It would be a difficult mattersimply to abandon our responsibilities in the colonial territory.    But I see no alternative.    The basic logic ofmerging Aden with the Federation was that it could notsurvive in independence on its own and at odds with the protectorate.    That remains true.    It is true that wecould make some effort to establish Aden as a separatestate, i.e. taken out of the Federation, with a separatethough republican constitution similar to that partiallysuspended in September 1965-    But this would not work.There would be accusations within the territory and atthe United Nations that we were dismembering&apos; the countryin violation of the United Nations resolutions.    Thiswould antagonise the ^orces, the NLF and the Sultansalike and probaoly precipitate immediate chaos withinAden as the factions resorted to arms.    The civilservices are inextricably intermixed,  and so are thegovernment machines.    FQr similar reasons it would notbe practicable to refuse to terminate british sovereignty in Aden and stay on in the hope that something satisfactory could be arranged if we did.The task would be impossible, and a   de facto resolution of the problem would be delayed rather than assisted.25.    For the reasons at paragraphs 10 and 11 above wecannot at present give any indication that we may not continue the aid promised to the Federal Government inJune 1966.    At the same; time we and Parliament may find it hard to accept that recent events should leaveunaffected the very high level per capita expenditurehitherto envisaged for the Federation;    even without theadditional offers of June 1967,  this amounted,  over three/years-1 3-
years, to over  30 million military subvention, some 9 million civil aid and an unspecified development loanand other grants to a territory with well under a million people.    If continuance seems likely we may moreover also have to resolve the subsidiary question whether the ratio of military to civil assistance has to be as high as hitherto intended,26.    I intend to take the line in public that futuresupport obviously depends largely on discussion with thenew regime when it emerges.    If In the end. there is nocentral successor regime, our options would be open.    Thequestion would then arise whether and, if so, for how long we should continue to provide and to keep the militar;and civil machines functioning.   My present thinking isshort term instalments at present levels to keep themfunctioning till we see what is to emerge.    If by indepen-dence a successor central regime has emerged, and providedthat its attitude towards us in tolerable, I think we may feel compelled to continue a fairly high level of aid.No&apos;c to do so would deprive the emergent government of its financial sinews both civil and military, and would thusprovoke the break-up we have been trying to avoid.    Thiswould no longer serve to impede our withdrawal but wouldbe damaging to our reputation and, subject to furtherconsideration according to developments, possibly ourwider interests.    To end over a century&apos;s responsibilityby leaving a chaos which aid could mitigate would not bevery creditable.   We must consider all this later,including the High Commissionerss argument in paragraph 10above, but neither can or should decide it now.    If we continue aid, we should rationalise it as much as possiblegiving single block grants for military and civil assis-tance to the territory as a whole and making, for example,no separate provision for the states of the Eastern aden protectorate.    In this connexion we have to remember ourseparate assurance to the Hadhrami Beduin Legion in Junethat, subject to various conditions, they would be paid for two years after independence.    I do not ask mycolleagues to consider this now, but expect to revert toIt and associated problems as necessary later.Military Training and Advisory Mission27.    It follows from the need to keep the South Arabianforces in play that we cannot, within the question ofmilitary aid, take any new decision at this point on theprovision of the Military Advisory and Training Mission onwhich my colleagues decided in June 1967..    This has been nominated (apart from the medical component which it has proved Impossible to supply).    More than half of the 60members nominated are, surprisingly, volunteers.   About 20are on 1h days&apos; notice to move to Aden from 1 November.The remainder are already in Aden, or will not in any case be needed till later.    There is real question whether a&quot;nationalist&quot; government will ask for this Mission (theSouth Arabian Army still want it) and whether, when things are clearer, it would be in our interests to provide it insuch uncertain circumstances.   We may well in any casefind it impossible to commit such a Mission to its func-tions if we cannot conclude adequate status arrangements with a successor regime.Agreement on Independence28. Before the upheaval .we envisaged the entry into forceof a new constitution, the termination of sovereignty in/colonial
colonial territory and the ending of our protection overthe rest of the country as a combined operation.    It wasto result in the independence of the Federation as asingle international entity, and the Independence of theunfederated Eastern Aden Protectorate States with it orseparately.   As far as we can now foresee this remains the right course.    If, however, we can conclude any formal agreement on transfer of authority to a successorcentral authority, and if we have any means of exactingconditions in relation to this, we should also try tocover certain outstanding problems discussed below at thesame time.    It is just possible (but no more, given thepolitical and timing difficulties involved) that someaspects of aid could be a sanction in this.    If we cannotexact any conditions, we shall have to consider unorthodoxaction.NgLt j, onall tjLJsLug g. $ tons29.    In the new draft constitution they had approved butnot been able to enact, and in a Federal Nationality law which had been enacted but had not been brought into force,we persuaded the Federal Government to adopt a liberalapproach to nationality questions.    Broadly speaking anyone who was born in Aden, or whose father was born in Aden,would be among those to qualify as a South Arabian citizen.Had the Federal Government been able  co make their laweffective, the Home Secretary would have been able to make an Order under the Schedule to the Aden, Perim and KuriaMuria Islands Act to deprive persons of their citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies if they were entitledto this other new status.   The total with entitlement tocitizenship of the UK and Colonies could well be as much as80,000 and is certainly well over 50,000.    It includesbetween. MO,000 and 30,000 Indians and other non-Arabs whoare in no sense UK belongers.    If no Order could be madeby the Home Secretary, the practical consequence would bethat, subject to certain formalities, these persons would retain their present citizenship and be exempt from theCommonwealth Immigrants Act.30.    If the matter can be negotiated the High commissioner will try to get the successor authority to endorse thisdecision of their predecessors.    They may well howeverresist or stall, in reaction against anything their predecessors decided and also in xenophobic hostility toHindus in particular.    If these people do not acquire south arabian (or some other valid) citizenship there would be noscope under the UK&apos;s Nationality Act to deprive them of UKcitizenship.    My Department have considered making anAden Ordinance under the High Commissioner^ authority but have concluded that that could not serve.    It could onlycreate an Adeni citizenship which, as Aden is unlikely tobe an international entity, does not get around thedifficulty.    If we are to act at all,  the only other course open to us is an Order in Council bringing the FederalNationality Law into force.    This would be an unusual actioninasmuch as citizenship is essentially a domestic matter andwe have frequently emphasised that we have no domestic power with the Protectorate.    I am advised however that such anOrder can be made and would be valid. Its justificationwould in part be that we had an obligation to give thepopulation of South Arabia a citizenship at the time of independence which was sanctioned by law and could be recog-nised internationally. The successor authority would be free to repudiate the citizenship we had prescribed after independence.    If the Home Secretary made a matching Order under/the-15-
the Schedule to the Aden Act taking away U.X. citizenshipfrom those on whom the Order in Council had conferredSouth Arabian citizenship, he might subsequently be criti-cised as responsible for the statelessness of the peopleof non-Arab race should these fail to secure from the suc-cessor Government the South Arabian citizenship which theOrder in Council had conferredo    I understand that theHome Secretary would nevertheless be prepared to consider making such an Order if our Order in Council had not beenrepudiated after a decent interval of two or three weeks(under the Schedule he would still thereafter be free to vary or cancel his Order should developments require this)his decision on that would be later.    But the basis of anOrder in Council must be laid, if at all, before indepen-dence.    I therefore recommend.:that we should proceed by way of theOrder in Council envisaged above before independence. &quot;Terminal Benef itjL of tlie^ Public Service31o    It is a world wide principle of ours that successorgovernments undertake responsibility for the pensionsand other terminal benefits of the public service, whetherexpatriate or indigenous.    They are held to have served theterritory and not H.ILG.   We have &quot;always concluded PublicOfficers&apos; Agreements where necessary to ensure this 0    Incases where the successor government has defaulted, we havemade the necessary payments to &quot;United Kingdom&quot; public servants but on   the basis that these are advances forreimbursement when the successor government honours itsobligate .:us,   We have not covered default in respect ofpublic servants other than the British expatriates.    We had agreed with the Federal Government on the basis of aPublic Officers&apos; Agreement;.    In accordance with the Over-seas Service Aid Scheme, H.m0g0 have expected- to meet halfthe cost of the compensation for loss of career of &quot;designated-nated&quot; (i.eD UoK.-based) civil servants together with theproportion of pensions and commuted pensions gratuitiesattributable to the British contribution to their salariesunder the Aid Scheme.    The remainder of the terminal bene-fits of &quot;designated&quot; officers, and the whole cost of the retirement benefits of &quot;non-designated&quot; (he. other non-indigenous) civil servants would normally be the direct responsibility of the South Arabian Government.   The totalsof these local liabilities ares-Designated Officers(a) Compensation  328,000(b) Interest on outstanding balances of compensation instalments   77,000(c) Commuted Pensions Gratuities  163,000/(d)-1 6-.
(d) Pensions per annum  115,000   xNon-Designated Officers(e) Commuted Pensions Gratuities  132,000(f) Pensions per annum  h/5,000   xx Figures include pensions already in issue as wellas those arising at Independence.    We had agreed toprovide the Federal Government with loans on easyrepayment terms to a total of  700,000 to assist them to pay the benefits in (a),  (b),  (c) and (e).The provision of loans for items (a), (b) and (c)to territories acnieving Independence has been general practice,,    In recognition however of SouthArabians very difficult financial position, we hadexceptionally agreed to help them to pay also item(e), the commuted pensions gratuities of non-designated-nated officers.    It was however expected that, as elsewhere, the local Government would meet the re-current pensions bill (items (d) and (f)) themselves,,These arrangements may well now prove abortive.32.   The High Commissioner has recommended that we shouldmake an early announcement that HMG will assume direct responsibility for the accrued terminal benefits of the designated (UK-based), non-designated non-indigenous(he. Indian), and local (he. South Arabian) public ser-vants alike in order to stave off possible industrial action before independence.33o    There is growing pressure from civil service represent-atives which may be reflected in Parliament here.   Mygeneral conclusion is that the strain of recent years andthe poor prospects of e.g. Indian civil servants in face of arab xenophobia against Hindus and Christians, and theabsence of a normal Public Service settlement justifiesus in treating all categories of expatriate non-South Arabianofficers similarly in relation to the payment of pensions.Further the prospects of an effective successor government,in the short time before independence, being persuaded to honour our concept of their obligations seem poor enough tojustify our taking on their terminal benefits, though wewould hope that this would be a temporary expedient pending-negotiation of something better.    I should add that thedraft Public Officers&apos; Agreement covered these classes onthe same basis and we might be accused of discriminationamong expatriates on racial grounds if we treated themdifferently now.3h.    I think, however, that the South Arabian civil ser-vants are in a different class.    Apart from precedent,they are of the country and must look to the governmentof their own people.    The attitude of many of them toterrorism has been equivocal.    It is questionable how far/any-1 7-
Q CJ fi*j if ifany concession on gratuities would in fact affecttheir readiness to remain in the public service, whetherthey would attempt industrial action, and whether theNLF or the Arab forces would stand by and let them doso (the NLF are known to have shown concern to keep thecivil service at work).    The additional cost of takingon their terminal benefits would be about  1,85 million for gratuities plus an annual bill of  0,255 million for pensions.    If the latter were also commuted,  the lump sum of such commutation would be a further  3-5 million.    These considerable figures are for the civilservice and exclude the Armed Forces and the Police.35.    Two consequences of deciding on independence bythe end of November, without any certainty about a successor government,  are first that we must inform thepublic service;  and, secondly,  that we cannot expect theexpatriates to remain in any way bound,   so far as weare concerned,  to stay on after independence.    We must give notice to the expatriate staff (most of whom in anycase have indicated their intention to leave) and the corollary of this is that we cannot offer the continuedservice of expatriate officers to the successor govern-ment.3o.    I therefore recommend:(a) that I inform the High Commissioner thatwe cannot accept post independenceresponsibilities in respect of indigenousofficers;(b) that I instruct him to try for a publicOfficers&apos; Agreement which could not, by virtue of paragraph 35, hand over expatriatepublic servants to the successor government,but would seek to confirm that government&apos;acceptance of liability for terminal benefits;but that we should in the last resort acceptdirect responsibility for designated and non-designated non-South Arabian officersif it cannot be concluded or if, having been concluded, it is not fulfilled by the successor regime.    This would mean thatsubsequent payments under (a),  (b), (c) and(e)  in paragraph 31 would be made direct tothe officers concerned from money at presentearmarked for the  700,000 loan that we hadalready offered.    It would not thereforeconstitute a new commitment.    In additionhowever we would have to assume pensionliabilities of/  160,000-18-
 160,000 per annum (items (d) and (f))*     The test foreligibility must be the classifications in the existingPublic Service Regulations and would not be affected if some of those covered should subsequently acquire south arabian nationality under the proposals discussed at para-graphs 27 and 280     I should add that some officers on con-tract but within the same classifications would also be due for terminal benefits but these cannot be assessed at thepresent time,,DSBjTS37o    Aden State has loan debt outstanding as follows:(1) loans by totalling  3*82 million;(2) a London Market loan of  lc33 million maturing1972/74 (against this there is a sinking fund of  f million held by the Crown Agents astrustees);(3) a^locally issued debenture loan of  1.2 million(of which over three-quarters is held by the currency Authority0)We shall naturally do our utmost to secure repayments ofthe debt owed to the Exchequero   While H.M.G. has no formal obligation to the subscribers to the other loanswe will be open to criticism if we do not do what we can toensure that these liabilities are met o    If proper agreements on independence can be concluded we shall try to ensure a formal transfer of responsibility for them.CURRENCY380   The South Arabian Currency Authority is a corporatebody established under Federal Law.    It has reserves(nearly all in sterling) of about  20 million, a currencycirculation which has been about  18-19 million, and stocks of unissued notes which, though reduced after June,still approach the quantity of currency in circulation.,These assets and liabilities are South Arabian, but theposition is being examined carefully in relation to sterling and the scheduled territorieso-19-
