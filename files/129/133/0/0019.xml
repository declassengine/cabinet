FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF SPEECH BY MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS LORD CHALFONT IN THE CONSULTATIVE ASSEMBLY OF COUNCIL OF EUROPE AT STRASBOURG ON SEPTEMBER 26.

DEAR PRESIDENT,

I NEED HARDLY SAY IT IS A GREAT PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS ASSEMBLY THIS AFTERNOON.

? COMING TO THIS ROSTRUM, AS I DO TODAY TO SPEAK OF OUR ? AND OUR ASPIRATIONS FOR THE UNITY OF EUROPE, IS BOUND TO REFLECT ON HOW MUCH HAS BEEN SAID HERE ON THIS THEME OVER THE PAST YEARS. HOW MANY PASSIONATE ARGUMENTS AND DEBATES HAS THIS HISTORIC CHAMBER HEARD AND HOW MANY GREAT EUROPEAN&apos;S - A THOUGHT TO ? PROPER HUMILITY.

OF COURSE, NO SINGLE DEBATE, NO SINGLE SPEECH WILL OF ITSELF CHANGE THE COURSE OF EVENTS. BUT ALL OF US, I THINK, AS WE TAKE PART ? IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONSULTATIVE ASSEMBLY HAVE A SENSE THAT WE ARE CONTRIBUTING IN SOME SMALL WAY TO ONE OF THE GREAT REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS IN THE LONG HISTORY OF OUR CONTINENT.

I THINK WE HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BELIEVE THAT THESE MIDDLE DECADES OF THE 20TH CENTURY WILL BE LOOKED UPON BY THOSE WHO COME AFTER US A A VERY SPECIAL, A VERY PECULIAR AND A VERY FORMATIVE TIME. IT MAY WELL BE THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMMUNITY AND OUR PRESENT ? AND SEARCHINGS FOR A WAY OF BRINGING OUR COUNTRIES TOGETHER - WILL STAND OUT IN THE RECORD OF THE HISTORY AS SOMETHING EVEN ? AND MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THE CATACLYSMIC WARS OUT OF WHICH EFFORTS SPRANG. MEN MAY YET SAY "THAT IS WHEN IT HAPPENED, THAT IS WHEN IT BEGAN, THAT IS WHEN THE FOUNDATIONS OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY WERE FIRMLY LAID".

BUT, WHATEVER THE VERDICT OF HISTORY, IT IS SURELY TRUE THAT OUR OCCUPATIONS AND OUR ENDEAVOURS TODAY IN WESTERN EUROPE WILL BE SEEN IN THE FUTURE AS PART OF A MUCH LARGER, AND A MUCH ? PICTURE. AND WE MUST SEE IT IN THAT WAY TOO.

WHEN WE LOOK AT THE TURMOIL AND THE CONFLICT IN THE REST OF THE WORLD OUR AFFAIRS HERE IN EUROPE MAY SEEM AT FIRST TO GIVE LITTLE CAUSE FOR CONCERN.

SINCE THIS ASSEMBLY LAST MET THERE HAS BEEN A CONFLAGRATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. FIGHTING IN THE CONGO AND NIGERIA. PERPETUAL UPHEAVAL IN CHINA. TERRORISM IN HONG KONG. VIOLENT CHANGE IN SOUTH ARABIA AND THE WAR IN VIETNAM GRINDS MERCILESSLY ON.

BUT EVEN THIS CATALOGUE OF BLOOD AND MISERY IS NOT THE WORST OF OUR AFFLICTIONS. VIOLENCE AND UPHEAVAL ARE ONLY THE BOLDER BRUSH STROKES IN A BROADER AND MORE TERRIBLE CANVAS.

MILLIONS OF OUR FELLOW MEN MR PRESIDENT LIVE LIVES WITHOUT HOPE DIGNITY THEIR CONSTANT COMPANIONS ARE POVERTY, HUNGER, FEAR AND DISEASE. THE POPULATION INCREASES ALARMINGLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE ALREADY MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN DIE NOT IN HUNDREDS, BUT IN THOUSANDS. THERE ARE TOO FEW DOCTORS TO CURE THOSE WHO SUFFER.

OUR  iNDIViDUAND LARGELY UNCO.....ORD I NATED EFFORTS   IN WESTERN EUROPE - REAL .1 COUFOR VERY LITTLE.EUROPE DIVIDED   IS MERELY  AN AGGREGATE OF GOOD  INTENTIONS., EUROUNITED WILL BE A POWER. FOR PEACE,,  AS MR EOELMAN SAID EARLIERTODAY WE MUST NOT REPEAT THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST,,IT  IS WHEN WE COME TO CONSIDER HOW TO ACHIEVE THIS UNITED EUROTHAT OPINIONS BEGIN TO DIFFER,  BUT EVEN HERE  THE overwhelming majority OF US ARE. OF ONE MIND::  WHAT REMAINS  IS TO CONVINCETHOSE,  WHO AT PRESENT  SEEM CONTENT TO LEAVE. EUROPE DIVIDED,,ONE OF THEIR  ARGUMENTS,  SO FAR AS THE ACCESSION TO TI IECOMMUNITIES OF  MY COUNTRY  IS CONCERNED,   IS THAT BRITAIN  IS NOT YFSUFFICIENTLY EUROPEAN - THAT WE STILL CLING TO  THE VESTIGES OFOUR  IMPERIAL PAST  AND THAT WE CONDUCT OUR AFFAIRS  IN STRONG ANGLOSAXON ACCENTS.   I  THINK  IT  IS TIME,,  MR PRESIDENT,  TO PUT THiSHERESY TO REST,,ALL THE GREAT COUNTRIES OF EUROPE, MY OWN AMONGST THEM, HAVEUNDERGONE VAST AND FUNDAMENTAL. CHANGES  IN, THIS CENTURY0   IN THEYEARS FOLLOWING  1914 - 18 THE STRENGTH AND POSITION OF THE GREAT-COUNTRIES OF WESTERN EUOPE HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO DECLINE  INRELATION TO THOSE. OF OTHER GREAT POWERS.THEN THERE FOLLOWED THE SECOND WORLD WAR.  THE EFFORT WHICH WEINTO THAT SAPPED THE LIFE-BLOOD OF MY COUNTRY,,  A3  IT DID THE LIFEBLOOD OF OUR NEIGHBOURS.  YET,   IN A WAY- AND  THIS  IS SOMETHING TOBE REMEMBERED - BRITAIN EMERGED A FITTER,   IF  A LEANER COUNTRY.AM THINKING PARTICULARLY OF THAT REMARKABLE PERIOD AFTER THE war when,   IN THE SPACE OF  A FEW YEARS, - WE COMPLETELY RE-FASHIONEDTHE SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF OUR COUNTRY  AND LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OFTHE SOCIAL DEMOCRACY WHICH BRITAIN  IS TODAY.THE PERIOD AFTER THAT,  FROM  1947  RIGHT UP UNTIL THE present day,  HAS SEEN US HEAVILY ENGAGED  IN THE PROGRESSIVE TRANSFORMATIOOF  A WORLD EMPIRE.,,  AND   IN HELPING,   AS BEST WE CAN FROM OURLIMITED RESOURCES,   THE  INDEPENDENT STATES WHICH HAVE EMERGED,,AT THE SAME TIME,  WE PLAYED OUR PART  IN DEFENDING THE FREE WORAGAINST ASSAULT FROM WITHIN AND FROM WITHOUT.   IN MALAYA,  in korea,  AND PERHAPS MOST NOTABLY,   IN EUROPE  ITSELF,  WE have contributed FULLY TO THE COMMON CAUSE.BUT NOW  IT IS PLAIN FOR ANYONE TO SEE THAT THE TRANSITIONALPHASE WHICH HAS MARKED THESE PAST 20 YEARS  IS ENDING, THEPROCESS OF DE-COLONISATiON  IS ALMOST COMPLETE,,,  AND THERE HAS .86*A PREDICTABLE CHANGE  IN OUR DEFENCE POLICIES,,   IN JULY WE ANNOUNUA DRASTIC REDUCTION OF OUR MILITARY COMMITMENTS EAST OF SUEZ, AlwMADE CLEAR THAT OUR FIRST PRIORITY WAS THE SECURITY OF EUROPEWITHIN THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK OF THE WESTERN ALLIANCE.

WE NEED ALSO ACTION BY GOVERNMENTS TO CLEAR AWAY BARRIERSTHE REAL I SAT ION    BY  INDUSTRY OF THE POTENTIALITIES OF   THEARCED MARKET,  WITHIN AN ENLARGED EUROPEAN ECONOMIC community would BE THE AIM OF  THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO WORK WITH THEIRTNERS FOR THE CREATION OF THE  INFRASTRUCTURE UPON WHICH:0PEAN INDUSTRY COULD BUILD,,  WE WOULD LOOK FOR THE ACCELERATION OFSENT EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE COMMON  INDUSTRIAL STANDARDS,  PERFORMANCEiUIREMENTS AND CERTIFICATION AND TESTING    SYSTEMS-  WE WOULD SEEK TO&apos;ELCf A &quot;EUROPEAN PATENT8&quot;,  THAT  IS TO SAY  A SYSTEM FORBTECT1NQ INVENTIONS AND PROVIDING FOR THEIR LICENSING AS WELL ASPROTECTION OF OTHER FORMS OF  INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY ON AROPEAN BASIS, THIS OF COURSE  IS AN AREA WHERE GREAT STRIDES HAVElEADY BEEN MADE  IN THE    COUNCIL OF EUROPE.

ANOTHER EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AREA TO BE CONSIDERED FOR CO-OPERATION IS THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY. THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAVE DONE A GREAT DEAL OF WORK ON COMPUTERS AND THE FRENCH AND GERMAN GOVERNMENTS HAVE ADVANCED A GREAT DEAL TOO. WE WOULD, I THINK, WANT TO SUGGEST THAT GOVERNMENTS AND INDUSTRIES SHOULD GET TOGETHER FOR INSTANCE TO TRY TO REACH AGREEMENT ON COMPUTER SPECIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SEVENTIES. A BILL IS NOW BEFORE THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT UNDER WHICH THE POST OFFICE IN MY COUNTRY WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A NATIONAL DATA PROCESSING SERVICE. AND HERE PERHAPS WE HAVE THE NUCLEUS OF A EUROPEAN DATA PROCESSING SERVICE. THIS OF COURSE WOULD NEED TO BE CONDUCTED ON THE BASIS OF COMPATIBILITY, COMPATIBLE COMPUTERS. COMPUTER LANGUAGES, MEMORY SYSTEMS AND ACCESS AND PRINT OUT FACILITIES. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF TRANSMISSION FACILITIES THIS CO-OPERATION COULD BE SEEN AS AN EXTENSION OF THE COMPATIBLE TELEGRAPH, TELEPHONE AND TELEPRINTER SERVICES THAT ALREADY EXIST IN EUROPE.

IN BRITAIN WE HAVE THE FIRST COMPUTER SYSTEM IN WHICH INTEGRATED CIRCUITS ARE USED THROUGHOUT. AS MANY OF YOU WILL KNOW, THIS NEW TECHNOLOGICAL COMPONENT IS CREATING AND WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE A REVOLUTION IN THE SPEED AND POWER OF COMPUTERS THEMSELVES. AND THIS IS ANOTHER ASPECT IN WHICH WE THINK WE SHALL BE LOOKING FOR EUROPEAN CO-OPERATION.

ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN AND MOST FASCINATING TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS TO COME FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS HAS BEEN THE HOVERCRAFT. THIS IS ANOTHER INDUSTRY BASED ON THE MOST ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY WHICH OUGHT CERTAINLY, TO BE EXPLOITED ON A EUROPEAN BASIS. MOST PEOPLE STILL THINK OF HOVERCRAFT ONLY IN TERMS OF RIVERS, LAKES AND INLAND WATERS BUT THEY HAVE A GREAT MANY MORE APPLICATIONS THAN THIS., PARTICULARLY INTERESTING PERHAPS IS THE HOVERTRAIN, IN WHICH OUR FRIENDS IN FRANCE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES, AND WHERE PERHAPS THE LINEAR INDUCTION MOTOR, WHICH HAS BEEN FURTHEST DEVELOPED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, COULD FIND A PARTICULARLY APT USE.

HAVE A QUOTED A FEW EXAMPLES OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ADVANCED SCIENCE BASED INDUSTRIES IN WHICH GOVERNMENTS MIGHT PLAY A PART TO SUPPLEMENT THE MUCH GREATER EFFORTS WHICH INDUSTRY ITSELF WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE, IF THEY WERE GIVEN THE RIGHT MARKET CONDITIONS AND VIGOROUS ACTION BY THE GOVERNMENTS TO HARMONISE THEIR POLICIES AND CREATE A REAL EFFECTIVE INFRA-STRUCTURE AND I AM SURE THAT A NUMBER OF OTHER EXAMPLES COULD EASILY BE QUOTED. THE DEVELOPMENT AND UTILISATION OF NUMERICALLY CONTROLLED MACHINE TOOLS FOR EXAMPLE IS A MATTER IN WHICH OUR MINISTRY OF TECHNOLOGY ARE PLAYING A NOTABLE PART. THIS PERHAPS COULD BE THE STARTING POINT FOR EUROPEAN COLLABORATION IN THE WHOLE FIELD OF PROCESS CONTROL ENGINEERING. A NUMBER OF OTHER IDEAS WOULD CERTAINLY EMERGE FROM CLOSE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATIONS WHICH ALREADY EXIST IN A NUMBER OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WITH GOVERNMENT SUPPORT. IN SOME CASES THE FORMATION OF EUROPEAN-WIDE INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATIONS MIGHT WELL BE A FIRST, NATURAL STEP.

I HAVE TRIED IN A BRIEF SPACE TO ADD A LITTLE TO WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID ON A GREAT SUBJECT. WHAT IS AT ISSUE HERE IS NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN EUROPEAN INDEPENDENCE. AS MY PRIME MINISTER HAS SAID, THE ONE WAY FOR EUROPE TO BECOME SUBSERVIENT TO OTHERS IS TO BECOME DEPENDANT ON THEM FOR THE MOST ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL INVENTIONS. EUROPEAN COUNTRIES CAN ONLY ACHIEVE A REAL STANDING IN WORLD AFFAIRS IF WE WORK TOGETHER NOW WITHIN A SINGLE MARKET TO DEVELOP OUR TECHNOLOGY AND THE LOGIC OF A EUROPEAN TECHNOLOGY DEMANDS A EUROPEAN POLITICAL COMMUNITY WITHIN WHICH INDUSTRY CAN OPERATE EFFICIENTLY FOR THE COMMON GOOD.

IT WAS JUST EIGHT MONTHS AGO, MR. PRESIDENT, THAT MR. WILSON ADDRESSED THIS ASSEMBLY. MANY OF YOU HEARD THAT SPEECH., AND MANY BOTH HERE IN STRASBOURG AND THROUGHOUT EUROPE, WERE I KNOW DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY IT. IT WAS CLEAR AND IT WAS POSITIVE. IT REVEALED
