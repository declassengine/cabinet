65COPY NO.CABINETREPOR.T OF THE MINISTERIAL. COMMITTEE ON THEPOWERS OF THE HOUSE OF LORDSMemorandum by the Lord chancellor the Ministerial Committee on the Powers of the House of Lordswas appointed in accordance with the conclusions of the Cabinet at their meeting on 28th June, 1966 (CC(66) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 2) with thefollowing terms of reference:-&quot;To work out proposals for the abolition of the power of theHouse of Lords to withhold consent to subordinate legislationsubject to affirmative or negative resolution, and to delay the passage of Bills;  and to arrange for the preparation ofthe necessary legislation. &quot;At that meeting the Cabinet also decided that the question of the composition of the House of Lords should not be reopened in thisconnection.2.       The Ministerial Committee have considered proposals accordingly,and our conclusions, so far as we have been able to take them, are setout in the Annex to this memorandum.3.     The Committee have, however, also reached the conclusion that legislation, which was limited to dealing with the powers of the Lordsover legislation, would be unsatisfactory in itself and open to criticismby our own supporters as well as by the Opposition.     The most importantobjection to the proposal to deal with powers only is that, despite therestriction which it would impose on the formal powers of the Lords to obstruct Government legislation, It would almost certainly result in greater delay to the Governments programme of legislation as a wholethan is likely to result if the Lords&apos; powers are left as they are.    Solong as the Opposition have their present majority in the Lords, the achievement of the Governments legislative programme dependsentirely on the co-operation of the Opposition in that House.    At presentthat co-operation is forthcoming because the Lords know that they existon sufference.    K we now embark on controversial legislation which deals only with the powers of the JLords over legislation (and hence appearsto license the Lords to use such powers as are left to them), this connection-operation will inevitably be affected and our legislative programme-1-C(67)14531st August, 1967OCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJc- GOVERNMENT)
will staffer accordingly.    Further, we should be inhibited fromdeveloping the functions of the -Lords as a revising and scrutinisingchamber, complementary to the Commons, in order to improve the effective working of Parliament as a whole j  indeed the measures proposed v/ould be i*etrograde in their effect, since they would deprive the Lords of all their functions in relation to subordinate legislation,Finally, we should be embarrassed by the amendments which theOpposition would seek to make to widen the scope of the legislation by including changes in the composition of the House of Lords.4.       It is, therefore, the Committee1? considered view that there isno satisfactory way of dealing in isolation with the lords  powers overlegislation and that if the Lords7 powers only can be dealt with, we mustadvise that there should be no change in this Parliament.    There are,however, other aspects v/hich I should wish to develop orally to theCabinet.G.House of Lords, S. W.T.31st August, 1967-2-
annexiJBOLITION 01? THE FOfoBR OP THE HOUSE OP LORDS TO DELAY THE PASSIVE*  op-^ifSsM^o^^BmisTcoiisBsis-to suboeobujje lMisuMqrI.     Abolition of the jaower of the^ House of Lords to delay the passage1.     Under the Parliament Act 19&apos;1&apos;i, as amended by the 194-9 Act, if aPublic Bill (other than a money Bill) is to become lav in the face ofthe Lords&apos; use of their delaying powers, it must be passed by the commons in two successive Sessions and a minimum intery.e.1 of one year must elapse between Second Reading in the Commons in the first Session and third Reading in the Commons in the next.     It must reach the Lords atleast one month before the end of the two successive Sessions, and is presented automatically for Royal Assent, unless the Commons direct tothe contrary, if the Lords reject it for the second time.     For thispurpose if the Lords do not pass a Bill either without amendment or with amendments which are all acceptable to the Commons they are held to haverejected it.2.     The Ministerial Committee on the Powers of the House of Lords have considered various methods for reducing or abolishing this delaying power,but have concluded that the effective choice lies between two alternatives -(1)   The first method (Soheiiie A) is to replace section 2 of the act of 1911 by a new provision under which a Bill sent up to the lords at lea.st three months before the end of the Session,and either rejected by the Lords or not passed by them at theend of three months, could be submitted for Boyal assent withoutthe concurrence of the Lords on a resolution to that effect passedby the Commons.     The period of three months Y/ould be exclusive of adjournments.     Under this Scheme the vdiole process would be
concluded in the space of one Session;    the Lords would havethree months in which to pass any Bill sent up to them, and could be given more time (by delaying the passing of the commons resolution) in the case of Bills sent up early in the session.     If the Bill was passed by the Lords with amendments,only those acceptable to the Commons would be included in theAct as submitted for Royal Assent.(2)   The se cwnd method (scheme) is to remove the compulsoryminimum interval of one year which must elapse under the present parliament Acts between Second Reading in the Commons in thefirst Session and Third Reading in the Commons in the next.This would simply involve the repeal of the proviso to sub-section (l) ef section 2 ef the Act of 1911,     Under thisScheme a Bill rejected by the Lords (including a Bill passedby them with -amendments to which the Commons do not agree)could be passed into law by closing the Session and opening afresh Session in which the Bill r.would   be passed again by the commons.     If the Bill itself was urgent, the new Session need be of little more than one month&apos;s duration. ,3,    Sofeemg:A.     While Scheme A has presentational advantages andin the face of it would appear to be the simpler method of removing thedelaying power of the Lords over legislation, whether during or at theend of a Session, it is arguable on the other hand that its very effective-ness and ready availability are obstacles to its adoption.     At present alarge volume of legislation is passed expeditidusly through the Lords,who are willing to deal at short notice with Bills which are urgently needed for administrative reasons;    even on major controversial measuresthey have not been prepared to force the Government to use the existingParliament Acts.     The Government depend entirely on the co-operation ofthe Lords in maintaining the present flow of legislation and there is no power to impose a guillotine.     The adoption of Scheme A would be likelyto disturb present working relations.     The Lords would be working under a continuing threat and, since the new machinery could be invoked more easily and with less disturbance than the present Parliament Acts, the lords might be less unwilling to press their apposition, not only to majorcontroversial measures, but also to other Government Bills, or at least toavail themselves of the full period allowed to them for the passage ofsuch measures with consequent delay to the Government&apos;s legislative programme.     Further, if the Lords were to be allowed as long as threemonths to consider Bills, the Government would have to obtain Third(2)
Reading in the Commons by the beginning of May, if not earlier, in orderto be sure of getting measures enacted by the end of a normal Session;this disadvantage could be reduced by shortening the period of threemonths allowed to the Lords, but any such shortening would he criticised as unreasonably limiting the time needed to consider major Bills, andwould he likely to disturb general working relations even further.h-   Scheme B. This scheme at first sight appears to he less attractive as itseems less convenient to operate in practice - it would involve closing the session and passing an obstructed Bill through all its stages in the commons in a new Session hefore sending it to the Lords which might appearheavy handed..   But in the view of the Committee this apparent difficultyof operation is not a conclusive argument against the scheme.   Preciselybecause its use would be dramatic and possibly prejudice the continued existence of the Lords, they would he unlikely to force the issue just asthey have been reluctant to do so under the Parliament Acts as they stand.Constituting as it would a more remote threat than Scheme A, it would beless likely to disturb present working relations.   Further, the aggregateminimum time allowed to the Lords under this scheme (a total of twocalendar months, one in each Session) would he less than under Scheme A, sothat it would he possible under Scheme B to deal with Bills sent up late -even at the end of June or, in extreme circumstances, July.   (Though aperiod as short as this might he considered objectionable in any new scheme,it could be defended in the context of a limited amendment of the ParliamentActs which did not affect the total time for which the Lords must be inpossession of a Bill.)   Finally, since a Bill limited to dealing with thepowers of the Lords over legislation can only be presented as effecting a relatively small measure of reform, Scheme B has the advantage of greatlegislative simplicitry.5.   On the other hand, Scheme B has the disadvantage that financial andother essential Parliamentary business imposes certain limitations uponthe times at which a prorogation and an extra Session would be practicable.Prorogation would be likely to be impossible in the month of July andwould be difficult between March and June.   In effect, the open periods forstarting the new Session would be November to February, and the normaltime of adjournment for the summer recess.   If prorogation took placeearly in the Session and was followed by another short Session designedto secure the enactment of the disputed Bill in the minimum time, theeffect on the remainder of the government&apos;s legislative programme as planned for the original Session oould be serious, especially if the Lordswere unwilling in the circumstances to co-operate in special arrangementsfor carrying over other unfinished business.   However it should usuallyte possible to defer prorogation for the purposes of applying Scheme Buatil near the normal end of the Session, when the least inconveniencewould be caused because most, if not all, of the legislative business wouldbe finished.   If the primary objective is to secure the enactment by the(3)
normal end of the Session of a Bill rejected or obstructed by the Lords,Scheme B is as effective as Scheme A.     On balance, and primarily because it would be less likely to have a disturbing effect on working relationswith the Lords, the Committee consider that Scheme B is preferable toScheme A in the context of a measure limited to dealing with the powers ofthe Lords over legislation.     V/e have had a one clause draft for a Billprepared to give effect to this scheme.^Application to particular types.....of bill.     The present Parliament Acts do not apply to Bills introduced in theHouse of Lords.     There would, in any event, be difficulties in devisinga scheme to limit the powers of the Lords to reject or delay such Bills.In practice, however, the Government is unlikely to introduce in the Lordsa major controversial measure on which the Lords would be likely to take such action.     There is of course the risk of the Lords refusing to agreeto Commons&apos; amendments of a Lords&apos; Bill.     Express provision to deal withthis situation would not be compatible with Scheme B,   but, if the casearose, the situation could be met under Scheme T, by introducing in theConnons the original Bill as amended by the Commons.7.     Section 2 of the Parliament Act does not apply to Bills to extend the duration of a Parliament, to Private Bills and to Provisional OrderConfirmation Bills, but it does apply to Public Bills introduced by private members and to Hybrid Bills.     The Committee do not consider that any changis required in these respects and, in any event, under Scheme B it would be undesirable to complicate an otherwise simple measure by making specific reference to a particular type of Bill.II.   i^^J-M^LJ^^SypJL^^^^^PJ^ opjise^^tja suhojdinatje legislation^slation8.    There are two alternatives here.     The first and more drastic is toamend all the existing enactments which confer on both Houses power to block subordinate legislation (whether by passing a resolution forannulment or by rejecting a motion for approval).     The amendment wouldsimply transfer to the House of Commons clone the powers hitherto enjoyed by both Houses, and would of course be coupled with a G.ecision to conferthose powers on the House of Commons alone in any future enactmentproviding for Parliamentary control over delegated legislation.9.    This proposal would not necessarily involve any alteration in existing(or future) obligations to lay subordinate legislation before both Houses.It would remain open to the House of Lords accordingly to debatesubordinate legislation, but such debates would have persuasive force only.(O
Even so, this alternative might be considered unduly drastic having regardto the fact that the Lords do not in practice carry negative resolutionsagainst the Government nor refuse Government motions for approval.     more over it would mean the end of the scrutiny of subordinate legislation by theSpecial Orders Committee (at all events in its present form) which exercisesa useful function in the case of orders requiring affirmative approval, thusinvolving a net loss in the attention paid by Parliament to the content of subordinate legislation which could not be made up in the Commons withoutplacing additional burdens on the time of Members cf that House.10.   The Committee therefore considered the other alternative, namely, to limit the existing powers of the Lords in respect of subordinate legislationso as to ensure that the will of the Commons should prevail notwithstandingrejection of such legislation by the Lords.     Such a system would be moreconsistent with the philosophy of the Parliament Lets in the field oflegislation proper.     Under this alternative the powers of the Lords overstatutory instruments which are at present subject to a negative resolution passed in either House would he limited by providing instead that annulmentof such instruments should be subject to a negative resolution passed in both Houses.     This would leave the Lords with their existing power to passa negative resolution, but such a resolution would be ineffective unlessconcurred in by the Commons.     In respect of statutory instruments requiringaffirmative resolution, it might be provided that a resolution of theHouse of Commons approving an instrument should have effect as if passed by both Houses, if the House of Commons so direct, whether by the same or by a subsequent resolution.     In the ca.se where the Commons d.ealt with an affirmative resolution before it was taken in the Lords, it would thus beopen to the Commons to direct that the instrument should be treated as ifpassed by both Houses, so that any subsequent rejection of the Instrumentby the Lords would be ineffective.     Such precautionary action might benecessary if conflict with the Lords was known to be likely in a particular case, or had become likely as a general rule in consequence of strainedrelations between the two Houses.     However, invocation of these powers bythe Commons would be controversial and time-consuming and, in the atmosphereengendered by new Parliament Act legislation, the Lords would be likely to reject Orders in circumstances where they at present accept them.     TheCommittee do not, therefore, consider that it would be satisfactory to leavethe Lords even with the restricted powers suggested in this alternative.(5)
II. The difficulty of devising satisfactory arrangements for dealing withstatutory instruments is a further illustration of the more generaldifficulties inherent in any measure which is confined to dealing withthe powers of the Lords over legislation and does not extend to reform oftheir composition.     In the absence of such reform, the Committee concluded that they could only choose the first alternative, which would transfer tothe House of Commons alone the powers hitherto enjoyed by both Houses inrelation to statutory instruments, &quot;but they came to this conclusion withreluctance.     This alternative would require further examination in detail with a view to ascertaining what enactments, other than the statutory instruments Act, require separate amendments and with a view to drawingthe line between subordinate legislation to which the new provision shouldand should not apply.     A distinction should no doubt be drawn on linessimilar to the distinction between public Bills end other Bills, and thereis a borderline case (not yet examined) in the field of orders subject to special procedure under the Statutory Orders (Special Procedure) Act 19A-5.III. Summary of^Conclusions12.   On the assumption that the powers of the Lords to delay legislationare to be abolished but that there is to be no substantial change in thepresent composition of the House of Lords and no other alterations in itsfield of operations, the Committee&apos;s conclusions are -(1)   that the proviso to Section 2(l) of the Parliament Act 1911should be repealed, thus abolishing the existing limitationwhereby a Bill rejected by the Lords in two successive Sessionsmay not be presented for Royal Assent under that Section unlessone year has elapsed between Second Reading in the House ofCommons in the first Session and the passage of the Bill bythat House in the second Session.(2)   that existing enactments, which confer on both Houses power to block subordinate legislation should be amended so as totransfer to the House of Commons alone the powers hithertoenjoyed by both Houses.(6)
