NATIONALISED TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES -PROPOSED PRICE increases the First Secretary&apos;s paper C(67) 137 proposes a basicchange in, or at least a temporary suspension of, what has hitherto been a cardinal principle of government policy.    The PESC proposalsfor the transport bloc, as well as the price policy for the public sector, have been conducted on the basis of containing spending by reducing deficits and of securing a commercial return on investment.I accept that price increases in the nationalised industries, dealingas they do with basic services, have a special significance for prices and incomes policy, particularly over the next few months,    I agree,too, that we should take an overall look at the situation.    However,since an obligation   has been placed on me to make my contributionto the reduction of public expenditure, I must draw my colleagues1attention to the following facts.2.       The Railways Board (BRB) could net be under heavierpressure than tney are already to increase efficiency.     In the shortterm I have been personally urging the Chairman to do all he can to cut down the growing deficit.    For the longer term, the Study by theJoint Steering Group under Mr. John Morris provides the biggestopportunity ever presented for putting the railways on a soundereconomic basis.    Discussions on pay and efficiency are also being held by the Minister of Labour and my own Department is in constanttouch with the Board about the development of particular productivityschemes.3.     During the last five years the Eoard&apos;s manpower has fallen by32 per cent. t   the number of stations by 43 per cent. , of freightwagons by 43 per cent. , and of locomotives by 53 per cent.     Theyhave budgeted to reduce their working expenses in 1967 by 18 million over 1966 (at constant wage and price levels).     Yet,largely because of the falling off of heavy freight traffic, the deficitcontinues to mount and may be some  20 million more than webudgeted for in the Vote Estimate ( 128 million).    This increasedloss would fall directly on the Exchequer and thus diminish our ability to improve our social and other programmes.    I have therefore been pressing the Chairman of the Railways Board to take all the measurespossible to improve the situation, including raising charges where possible.-1-CONF1DENT1AL(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS government(67) 141 COPY NO.___65ZStJ^Jul^jL^J^CABINET
4.      The Board [s proposed increase in charges of which they havenotified me under &quot;early warning&quot; procedure are s-(i)    charges for parcels and sundries(ii)   coal charges(iii)   basic passenger mileage rate.In the annex there are fuller details of these three proposals.     Theproposed increases are expected to bring in increased revenue of 7. 6 million in a full year.    They are, therefore, increases of vitalsignificance in containing the rise in the deficit.London Transport board,      London Transport (tons) too is now in deficit.     Outturn this year&apos;s  expected to show a deficit of at least  11 million; next year it wouldbe  13 million without a   fares increase.     Their fares increaseproposals could yield about   8^ million increased revenue in a full year.6.      Passenger fares in London (tons and BRB) are subject tocontrol by the Transport Tribunal in accordance with statutoryprocedures.     The Tribunal is required to have regard to the criterialaid down in prices and income legislation.    In February, 1967, I asked the Chairmen of tons and BRB to defer applications to the Tribunal.They have, therefore( already waited nearly six months, and theTribunal proceedings (which include public hearings) take a long time.Therefore, London Transport fares cannot in any event go up for anothersix months - i, e. next January at the earliest.7.     My Department is working closely with tons in their efforts to increase productivity by the extension of one-man bus operation,automatic fare collection (rail and bus) and re-organisation in theirworkshops.    Even more important, there is the present intensiveReview (with London Transport) of the Boardls activity by aDirecting Group under my Joint Parliamentary Secretary,Mr. Stephen Swingler.     The Group already have comprehensivematerial from Consultants and are now preparing their Report.be (Parcels) Ltd.8,     The Transport Holding Company (THC) has a statutory duty toact like a commercial undertaking and is well aware of the need to offset rising costs by increased productivity and is making every effort to do so.    The Parcels Company measures the output of every driverand targets are set for individual rounds and depots, against whichperformance is compared, and adjustments are constantly beingmade to maximise the output of vehicles and drivers.    Similarly a close watch is kept on productivity of platform staff.     The number ofdifferent types of vehicles operated is being reduced, so increasing productivity in workshops.     The result of a thorough analysis of the relationship between maintenance and replacement costs pressed onTHC by my Department will in time make an increasing contributionto better utilisation of the fleet and greater economy of operation.-2-CONHDENTJAL
9,     At the Government^ request the Company reduced itsproposed increases in 1965 from 6 per cent to 4 per cent,    A furtherproposed increase was frustrated by the Standstill a year ago.10,     The result of the freezing of prices immediately after asubstantial wage increase,, and other rises in costs, and of atemporary fall in traffic occasioned by the general slackening in trade, has been a loss in profits of over  3 million over the last twoyears or so; and the rate of return on capital employed is, before tax,down from 21 per cent in 1964 to a forecast 5 per cent in 1967.    this makes it impossible to plough back profits on a sufficient scale tomake a reasonable contribution to the proportionally large scale new investment needed for an expanding but labour intensive industry in whichincreases in productivity will greatly depend on new investment.    Thepresent proposal is for price increases averaging 7j per cent -without it the Company will only be able to expand by borrowing fromthe Exchequer (which, by adding to the interest burden, will further increase their costs).11.     The nationalised industry departments have over the last fewyears made great improvements in the way in which they oversee and influence the efficiency of their operations,,    I do not suggest that theyhave done enough.    Investment control could be tightened up and in my own Department we are actively seeking to develop and improve our existing techniques.     In any case, where the industries are in deficitas are British Railways and London Transport, I have set up special and most detailed investigations.     The THC of their own accord re-organised their road haulage undertakings and substantially improvedtheir efficiency.    Nevertheless, I would of course welcome new ideaswhich can further help us to improve the Board&apos;s efficiency and willexamine with interest any proposals the Department of economic affairs may put forward.    But it will undoubtedly take a considerable time to devise new machinery, nor could it influence the need for the increases in charges now asked for by the transport undertakings.12.     I ask my colleagues to agree that in the absence of any short-term modifications of government policy, we must accept:-(i)   the increases in charges proposed by BRB in Annex I;(ii)    that tons should apply,to the Transport Tribunal for increases in charges (paragraph 5 above);  and(iii)   that be (Parcels) Ltd. should increase their chargesby an average of 7j per cent,B. A. C.Ministry of Transport SaE. 1.25th July, 1967-3-
ANNEXRevised Scale of charges for parcels and,sundries(a) The last increase was 10 per cent in January 1966.Since then costs have increased by approximately6 per cent, and the sundries service has continued tomake a heavy loss ( 25 million in 1966)0(b) The proposed increases will range from 2-g- per cent to7-g- per cent (with smaller increases on the more profitablelong hauls) with an average of 5 per cent and an estimated yield in a full year of  2.5 million,,(c) These increases takinto account the competitive position in relation to be, and there should be noresultant loss of traffic from rail to road.Revised scale of charges for coal and coke(a) The last increase was 5 per cent in January 1966.    Since-then there has been an increase in cost of approximately6 per cent, and the traffic made a loss of  10 million in 1966,(b) The proposed increases will range from 2-g- per cent to10 per cent according to size of consignment and operating pattern.    The aim will be to encourage themore economic train-load operation.,(c) The average effect will be about 9d. per ton, and the yield in a full year approximately  2,3 million.(d) Large industrial users (e,g. Central electricity generating Board, Imperial Chemical Industries,Portland Cement) have individual contracts withescalation Clauses and so will not be affected bythis revised Scale,The revised scale of ordinary passenger fares(a) The basic passenger fare of 3.25d. per mile (second class)and Uo87d, per mile (first class) was fixed inFebruary 1965c    Since then the Board has absorbedconsiderable increases in costs, including the 3i percent pay rise of October 1965 and the 3i per cent payrise of March 1967*(b) The proposal is to increase the fare to 3*Ud. (second class)and 5o27d0 (first class) an.increase of 5 per cent and per cent respectively.,   This means a widening of the differential between the first and second class from50 per cent to 55 per cent, a trend which the railways board regards as commercially desirable.(c) Allowing for a 2 per cent passenger resistance theestimated yield in a full year would be  2.8 million.(d) The Board also propose to experiment with surcharges abovethe standard passenger fare on certain routes and trains,just as elsewhere they offer discounts and reduced ratos.This flexibility of approach is vitally necessary in avery competitive field.(e) &quot;Tapered&quot; fares over 200 miles would be increased pro rata,but there would be no reduction in the amount of taper.
