(JMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC IvIAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)6fdC(67) 152 COPY NO._18th September, 1967CABINETHOUSE OF COMMONS PROCEDUREMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure have had under review:-(a.)    The impressive body of proposals for modernising House ofCommons procedure contained in the first six reports of theSelect Committee.(b)    The experience gained from our two Sessional experiments -morning sittings and Specialist Committees.In this memorandum I seek agreement of the Cabinet to theproposals which the Ministerial Committee recommend as a resultof this review.I; PUBLIC BILL. PROCEDURE2.      Finance Bill &quot;&apos;The most important change relates to the Finance Bill,    Duringthis Session we operated the compromise voluntary timetable backed witha residual sanction recommended in the Select Committee&apos;3 Fourth Report.In presenting this to the House, however, I made no secret of our view thatthe final solution should be to send the Committee Stage to a GrandCommittee upstairs.     The Ministerial Committee recommend thatthis proposal should be adopted for the 1967-68 Session,    allowing for the extended Report Stage which will be required it should stillsave six or seven long days on the floor of the House.I am discussing the detailed arrangements for the GrandCommittee with the Chief Y/hip and the Financial Secretary.    one point which has already emerged has a more general application.Since a variety of Departmental Ministers may be called upon toexplain partic ular clauses the proposal is that any Minister shouldbe free to attend and speak at any meeting of the Grand Committee,though not to vote.    In standing committees this right is at present available only to Law Officers.    It seems to the Ministerial Committeethat there would be advantage - particularly to Scottish and WelshMinisters - if this new rule were to apply to all standing committees,and I propose to proceed accordingly.1-CQNFIDENTIAL
3o       Timetabling of Committee and Report stages in paragraph 17 of their Sixth Report the Select Committee saidthat the facilities for voluntary timetabling of committee and reportstages should be strengthened.     Timetables should when necessary be drawn up by steering committees under the chairmanship of theStanding Committee Chairman or Mr. Speaker, as appropriate.     Whilstthey favour the retention of the traditional guillotine as the Government&apos;sultimate weapon the Select Com.mittee think that these arrangements should be supported by a procedure, comparable with the one agreedlast May for the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.The Ministerial Committee commend this proposal.4.      Second Reading Committee BillsThe Ministerial Committee would also accept the recommendations in paragraphs 20-21 that the reports of Second Reading Committeeproceedings should be bound up with the following day&apos;s CommonsHansard;  and in paragraph 26 that if a Bill has been referred to aSecond Reading Committee or the Scottish Grand Committee it shouldbe possible, subject to safeguards, to remit the report stage to that committee,5.       Third ReadingsThe Select Committee recommend in paragraph 27 of their sixthreport that Third Reading should be taken without debate, and should follow immediately on Report, unless a six-month or reasonedamendment has been tabled over the names of at least six members.This recommendation could give us an appreciable saving intime on the floor of the House.     The Ministerial Committee are infavour of accepting it,6.      Amendme nt sWe propose at last to get rid of the nonsensical rigmarole atpresent used for putting amendments.    In future the question will beput in the simple form &quot;That the amendment be made&quot;,7.      Statutory InstrumentsI propose to accept the extension of the terms of reference ofthe Select Committee on Statutory Instruments recommended by theSelect Committee in paragraphs 29-31 of the Sixth Report:(a) That the Committee should consider all Statutory instruments and not merely those subject to an affirmative or negative resolution.(b) That they should be empowered to report on drafting defectsas well as defects of vires.7
II; OTHER PROCEDURE recommendations.      Standing Order No. 9In their Second Report the Select Committee recommended:-(a) That the Speaker should have discretion to allow a matter raisedunder the Standing Order to be debated on the day after it is raised,,(b) That he should be specifically exempted from any obligation togive reasons for allowing or refusing such a debate.Some doubt has been felt in the Ministerial Committee as towhether recommendation (b) might not make it too easy for a Speakerto give in to the demand for a debate under SC9;  and the suggestionhas been made that whilst he should be freed of the burden of pastrulings he should nevertheless give his reasons for rejecting futuremotions.    On the other hand the present Speaker is on record as sayingbefore the Select Committee that this would simply build up an equallyrestrictive body of precedent for the future;  and recommendation (b)was subsequently pressed by the Conservatives.    I think we shall be wise to accept the Select Committee *s recommendation as it stands.The Select Committee also proposed, in paragraph 2 of theSecond B.eport, that the Opposition should be able to select up to fourhalf-days from their 29 Supply days for urgent debates.     The valueof this to the Opposition is marginal and it might produce minordifficulties of timing.    On the whole, however, the ministerial committee are in favour of accepting it.9.      Power to accept Closure on report at present only the Speaker may accept a closure Motion;  andthis is very burdensome.     The Chairman of the Select Committee on procedure has proposed to me that, for Report Stages only, the Housemight be invited to extend this power to the Deputy Speaker.     the ministerial Committee commend this.1U.      House Officers1 DressThe Clerk to the Commons would like his staff to be relieved by resolution of the House of the obligation to wear wigs and gowns,which is not an ancient tradition but a relatively modern innovation.Opinion is divided on this with the Speaker and, I believe, certainsenior Opposition Members against the change.     The ministerial committee recommend that the Clerks should be freed from theobligation to wear either wigs or gowns except on ceremonialoccasions such as the Opening of Parliament.     On this mattermuch turns on the present views of the Speaker and if the Cabinetagree I will pursue discussions with him along the lines of the ministerial Committee&apos;s proposal.
HI; FUTURE PIT SELECT COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE11.       Now that it has completed its massive work on Public BillProcedure I had hoped that the reappointment of the Select Committeenext Session would be unnecessary.    But the Ministerial committee feel that there are two more topics the Select Committee should consider,The first, which relates to the shortage of time for private members&apos; legislation, has been pointed, up this Session by the socialsignificance of two at least of the Bills considered.    In view of the strong feeling that more time should be given to private Members&apos;Bills I propose as an interim measure that in 1967-60 six o  the 12 daysnormally allocated for motions should be made available for Bills.The 16 days so provided will be divided equally between secondreadings and remaining stages.    Subsequently the Committ shouldmake an urgent report on the whole use of private Members1 time.The second topic, which is important but not urgent, relates to the annual Parliamentary timetable.     This has not been reviewedfor a very long time.    Would modern convenience be served by fiveterms and five holidays instead of the present four ?    If so should thelong Summer Recess be shortened so as to extend the others?    I have considered many schemes for improvement but find that they are allimpracticable unless we ai*e prepared to consider them in relation(a) to the timing of the Party conferences and (b) to the Finance Billtimetable,    I suggest that the Select Committee should be asked totake this as their second subject next Session.IV.; HOURS OF SITTINGS12.      Since last February we have had as a Sessional experimentregular morning sittings each Monday and Wednesday,    As the annex to this memorandum shows, they have ena.bled the Government to get a remarkable amount of secondary business through at very little costin time.    But owing to the resolute determination of the Opposition to frustrate the experiment by deliberately prolonging business on the evening of a morning sitting we cannot claim that we have attainedour stated objective of reducing the pressure of late night business on our hard-working whole-time Members,    Moreover they have on occasion brought the staff of the House under almost unendurable strain,13,      The Ministerial Committee considered three possibilities for ournext Session:-(a)    To abandon morning sittings and revert to previous practice.This would be a poor posture for a Government intent on modernisingParliament,    It would also be a breach of the commitment we made toour own backbenchers that in planning the timetable of the House we wouldswing the balance of advantage so as to favour the whole-time Memberagainst those who earn another living in the morning and so prefer- a latestart, even if it involves our whole-time Members in frequent late-nightsittings.
(b) We could Tgo the whole hog1 by starting every day at, say,10, 00 a. m. and finishing at 6, 00 p. m. or 7. 00 p. m.    But the ministerial committee found that this would not only make for great difficulty in theconduct of Cabinet and Ministerial business but would seriously disruptproceedings in standing and select committees.    In addition it was thoughtthat such an arrangement would fail to satisfy our provincial backbencherswho would rather have their evenings occupied.(c) We could introduce a new kind of suspension of the sitting,enabling the Government to stop a late night sitting and to substitute a morning spill-over whenever it thought necessary.    In this way wecould replace the regular scheduled Monday and Wednesday morningsittings by occasional morning spill-overs, for the most part whenreport stages are being taken in early summer.     The new motion forsuspension would be moved without notice and decided without debate.When business was running late, therefore, and the business managersfelt that it should be concluded without the rigours of an all-night sitting,it would be the normal routine for the Whip to move &quot;that the sitting be suspended until 10. 00 a, m. tomorrow&quot;,14.       The Mdnisterial Committee have decided to recommend proposal(c).    Under this procedure I believe that all-night sittings will normally be limited to a small number of traditional occasions (for example, theReport Stage of the Finance Bill and the Consolidated Fund Bill) whilealways remaining available if they are forced on us by obstructivetactics.    I do not expect that Ministerial attendance at the resumeddebate would be required so often as to interfere substantially with normal work.15,      In order to improve the efficacy of this new arrangement the ministerial Committee also recommend that:-(a) The time for debating affirmative resolutions after 10,00 p. m.should be limited to 1^- hours,    (This is effectively the procedure which applies to prayers against orders subject to negative resolution).    Themore important affirmative resolutions could still be brought on for debate in the afternoon but debate would not then continue after 10. 30 p. m.Orders which were insufficiently important to be brought on before10.00 p. rn. would be subject to the time allowance of if hours,.(b) It should not be permissible to call for counts after 10. 00 p. rn,at times when the House is considering affirmative resolutions, prayersagainst negative resolution orders or adjournment motions.(c) Standing Orders should be so revised that, if the suspension of thesitting until the following morning were moved, the half-hour adjournmentdebate could take place on that motion.V: SPECIALIST committees in considering proposals for the next Session the ministerial committee recognise that the number of Specialist Committees to beappointed is severely limited by the manpower available to serve them -m particular by the number of Clerks already allocated to select committees.    Although the new staffing structure recently approvedwill, in the long run, improve the supply of committee clerks, the
appointment of new committees in 1967-68 must depend on eliminating the overlap between, for example, the work of the seven EstimatesSub-Committees and that of the new Specialist Committees,,    I havereceived an assurance from the Chairman of the Select Committee on estimates that he will consider a reduction in the number of hissub-committees and I am also pursuing the question with the informalsteering committee which the Chairmen of Select Committees haverecently set up.    The proposals which follow are subject to a satisfactoryoutcome of these discussions:(i) The subject committee on Science and Technology should bereappointed.(ii)   The Departmental committee which this Session has been studying the Ministry of Agriculture should be replaced by a committee dealingwith those activities of the Department of Education and Science and theScottish Education Department which are not already within the purview of the Select Committee on Science and Technology.(iii) Providing a number of practical details can be worked outsuccessfully, the Foreign Secretary would welcome a new committee dealing with foreign zffairs.    I would welcome Cabinet agreement inprinciple to this project.(iv) The proposals for the Industrial Expansion Bill include asuggestion that specific proposals for Government intervention in industry could on occasion be submitted to a select committee.    our plans for an expansion of Specialist Committee work should thereforeinclude provisional allowance for this project.(v)  The project for pre-legislation committees which was mentioned by the Prime Minister in the debate on the Address has now been warmly welcomed by the Select Committee on Procedure.     The ministerial committee recommend that there should not be a separate specialistcommittee for this but chat an ad hoc committee should be established to consider the desirability of legislation in particular fields.     they propose that the first ad hoc enquiry should be into the question whether there should be a statutory restraint on the invasion of the privacy ofthe citizen.SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS17.      I therefore invite the Cabinet to agree that steps be taken:-(i)  To transfer the committee stage of the Finance Bill to a GrandCornmittee upstairs (paragraph 2).(ii) On public Bills generally, to implement the recommendations inthe sixth report of the Select Committee that there should be timetablingof cornmittee and report stages;  that Second Reading Committee bills should be able to be sent back to that committee for report stage; thatthird readings siEOtild normally be formal, and that the procedure for putting amendments should be simplified (paragraphs 3 to 6).
(iii) To authorise the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments toconsider the drafting as well as the vires of all statutory instruments(paragraph 7).(iv) To implement the main recommendations in the SelectCommittee&apos;s second report on Standing Order No. 9 (paragraph 8).(v)  To authorise the Deputy Speaker, as well as the Speaker, toaccept a closure motion on report (paragraph 9),(vi) To allow the clerks of the House to dispense with wig and gownexcept on ceremonial occasions (paragraph 10).(vii) To reappoint the Select Committee on Procedure specifically toconsider first, the use of private Members&apos; time;   and secondly, thearrangement of the Parliamentary year (paragraph 11).(viii)  To introduce, in place of scheduled morning sittings, anarrangement whereby late evening business could be pushed overto the following morning (paragraphs 12-15).(ix)  To have in the 1967-68 Session specialist committees coveringscience and technology;  the work of the Education Department;  foreignaffairs;  industry, and (as an ad hoc investigation) the scope for legislation on privacy (paragraph 16).R.H.S.C.Privy Council Office, S.W.1.18th September, 1967
