W. 1.6th October, 1967-1-
report OF THE MINISTERIAL COMLIITTEE on the house of lordsComposition and powers of the House of LordsWe v/ere invited by the Cabinet to put forward proposals forreforming the composition, powers and functions of the House of Lords(CC(67) 54th Conclusions, Minute 5).2,      Our proposals are:-(i)  That the power of the Lords to delay legislation should be restricted and their power be abolished to withhold consent to subordinate legislation against the will of the Commons.(ii)  That the hereditary basis of the Lords should be eliminated,thereby avoiding an in-built majority for any Party.(iii) That the Government of the day should be able to secure areasonable working majority over both Opposition Parties.(iv) That the reformed House of Lords should develop as a &quot;partof a modern Parliamentary structure complementing butsubordinate to the will of the Commons and with its functions and services more closely and efficiently integrated with thoseof the Commons.3,      While we must be prepared if necessary to over-ride oppositionwe believe that because these proposals involve major constitutional changes, they can best be worked out in the course of negotiation.Moreover, legislation which, while achieving our essential objectives,did not have to be forced through under the Parliament Acts, would avoid a disturbance of present working relations v/ith the opposition in the Lords which might threaten our legislative programme over aperiod of a year or more.4.      Such consultation with the Opposition could, however, onlysatisfactorily proceed on the basis of a firm announcement of our intention to legislate.    We therefore recommend that a passage shouldbe included in The queen s Speech on the Opening of the new Session inthe following terms -&quot;Legislation v/ill be introduced to reduce the powers of the Houseof Lords and to eliminate its present hereditary basis, therebyenabling it to develop within the framework of a modernParliamentary system&quot;.5,      In Appendix I we set out our proposals for restricting the powersof the Lords over legislation.     The scheme outlined in Appendix IIrepresents the limit to which we think we should go in meeting the-viewsof the Opposition leaders.    It would follow from the announcement inThe Queen&apos;s Speech of our intention to legislate that, if negotiationswith the Opposition broke down, we should be free to proceed v/ith ourown legislation.
APPENDIX IProposals for restricting the Power of the Lords over Legislation.Powers over BillsAs recommended in their report to the Cabinet annexed toC(67) 145, the Committee propose the removal of the compulsoryminimum interval of one year which must elapse under the present parliament Acts between Second Reading in the Commons in the first session and Third Reading in the Commons in the next.     This v/ouldsimply involve the repeal of the proviso to sub-section (l) of section 2of the Act of 1911.     Under this scheme a Bill rejected by the Lords(including a Bill passed by them with amendments to which the Commonsdo not agree) could be passed into law by closing the Session and openingafresh Session in which the Bill could bo passed again by the Commons.If the Bill itself was urgent, the new Session need be of little more thanone month1 s duration.Subordinate legislation in their previous report annexed to C(67) 145, the committee recommended., on the assumption that the composition of the Lordsremained unchanged, abolition of the power of the Lords to withholdconsent to subordinate legislation.    If, however, the composition ofthe Lords were changed as proposed, the Committee would wish to reconsider their previous recommendation with a view to enabling theLords1 scrutinising function to be developed, while at the same timepreventing them from rejecting subordinate legislation against the will of the Commons.-3-
APPEND EC IIA Plan for Reform of the LordsTntroductionIn their report last August (C(6?) 145) the Ministerial Committeesaid that there appeared no satisfactory way of dealing in isolation withthe Lordsr powers;  and that if consideration of composition and functions were to be excluded, it would be better to leave well alone.    Theirreasons were, briefly, as follows:(a) In the present situation (in which the House of Lords is effectivelydeterred from using its powers by the magnitude of the powers themselves)an alteration of powers alone might lead the Lords to abandon the restraintwith which they treat controversial commons legislation.(b) The introduction of legislation dealing only with powers would almost certainly lead the Opposition to propose amendments as tocomposition.(c) So limited a measure might inhibit the development of the Lordsas a revising and scrutinising chamber working as an integral part of abicameral legislature.Case for Reforms2.      The Ministerial Committee have further considered whether itwould be expedient to allow the House of Lords to continue as it is.They are against this for the following reasons:(a) The Government are committed in their Election Manifesto to the reform and modernisation of Parliament.   &quot;They cannot fulfilthis promise unless the composition and function of the Lordsare so changed as &quot;to reinforce the democratic element in modern Government&quot;,(b) Notwithstanding the view expressed in paragraph 1 there remainssome risk to a Labour Government from a House of Lords in itspresent form, both as regards Bills (particularly in the last year of a Parliament) and as regards subordinate legislation to whichthe Parliament Acts do not apply;  and the Manifesto categori-cally states that there will be legislation to deal with the Lords&apos;powers of delay.(c) There is strong evidence that both the Conservatives and the liberals are working on proposals for the reform of the composition and functions of the Lords,,    If the government do not take the initiative at present available to them to reform the Lords, the other Parties will take the initiative from them.The Ministerial Committee have therefore concluded that there v/ould bemuch to be gained, and nothing to be lost, by the Governments takingthe initiative in the coming Session.
ppnirability of a Consensus3t      It is clearly desirable that a constitutional reform of such weightas is now proposed should proceed by consensus;  or at any rate that theproposals should command some degree of acquiescence by the opposition parties, if not their active supports     There is reason to believe that aconsiderable measure of agreement could be reached on a &quot;two-tier&quot;system as described in the following paragraphs.4,      These proposals are therefore expressly designed to describe the result which might emerge from negotiation, without necessarilyruling out other kinds of reform.     The statement proposed for the queen&apos;s Speech in the covering memorandum would leave us free, if negotiations broke down, either to proceed unilaterally with the schemewe now propose or adopt some other solution.Proposals for Ileform5.      In outline, the scheme would at once deprive the hereditarypeerage of effective power in the House of Lords.    The exclusionwould be total as regards future recruitment from the hereditarypeerage.    Existing hereditary members would be excluded from voting, but permitted to attend and speak.    Effective power wouldbe concentrated in a newly appointed voting House.     This voting House,composed essentially of Peers of first creation, would be so arranged as to give the Government a working majority over the tv/o mainOpposition Parties,   But the House would still include in its membershipthose independent-minded individuals of distinction whose contributions,though occasional, are of undoubted excellence;  for example, scientists and similar specialists.6.      The scheme that the Committee now recommend is a.s follows.All Peers of first creation (whether they have been created Life Peersor Hereditary Peers) would be offered the voting writ.    An examinationof the individual circumstances of Peers of first creation has suggestedthat a considerable number would not be prepared to accept theobligations of a voting Peer.    Many of them, especially amongstthe Conservatives, are elderly and scarcely ever attend, while otherscan find time to do so only on occasion.    It would be open to them torefuse the voting writ and to opt instead for a speaking writ.     Thosewho undertook the obligations of a voting writ would be expected toattend frequently and play a full part in the increased work of are formed House more closely integrated with, and complementary to, the House of Commons.     There would be a retirement age (probablyaround. 75) for voting Peers.7,      For the reasons given in paragraph 6 it is likely that it will benecessary to supplement the number of voting Peers of first creation,both to enable them to fulfil the functions required of them and to ensurethe retention as voting Peers of a number of the better hereditary Peers,Mostly Conservatives, who attend regula.rly.    All hereditary Peers thuschosen would be made Life Peers so that they could sit and vote by virtue^appointment and not by hereditary right.    It would be for the party leaders on the invitation of the Prime Minister to make recommendations to him for these appointments.
g(      Though these additions from the ranks of the hereditaries wouldbe likely to include a number of the more valuable and assiduousmembers of the Lords, they v/ould still be only a small minority of present Peers by succession.     The question then remains whether to grant a speaking writ to the remaining hereditary Peers for theirlifetime only.     Though it can be argued that the inclusion of hereditary peers is not an essential part of a two-tier scheme it is a means bywhich &quot;power&quot; could be more painlessly removed from hereditary peers.    The right to speak v/ould also keep, as members of the House,a number of distinguished individuals who would be unlikely to attendregularly.    It could greatly help to ensure a speedier and easierpassage of tire reform, without a major political battle and the consequentwaste of Parliamentary time.9,     A number of points of detail arise in connection with a majorreform of the Lords.    For example, there is the representation ofBishops and Lav/ Lords.    It is possible to accommodate them (perhapson a reduced scale) within the scheme.     Other questions includeadministrative arrangements, pay, procedure and of course the formof the necessary legislation.     These are under study by Ministers and officials.Functions of Procedure10.      It is impossible to consider a meaningful reform of compositionwithout also considering changes in functions and procedure.     Theobject is to improve the efficiency of Parliament and to relieve the commons of some of its routine work by enabling the Lords to carry a heavier Parliamentary load, particularly in the less controversialfields of legislation.     More Bills of secondary importance might startin the Lords and it might even be possible to devise a system wherebyall stages of certain Bills need not be taken in both Houses;  for example,Law Commission Bills might be taken first in the Lords and only brieflyin the Commons, with very limited debate there (cf. Consolidation Bills).Possibly the Lox*ds could also shoulder more routine work on subordinate legislation and private legislation.    Some of these suggestions mayhowever have to wait upon negotiation between the two Houses afterthe reformed Lords has been constituted.Power sh.      If functions are to be so transferred, the Government will need to be reasonably sure of getting its busbies s through, and therefore tohave a small working majority over the Opposition Parties,    But sincethe Cross Benchers in practice rarely vote (and when a few do, theyeither break even or tend to support the Government of the day) it isconsidered unnecessary to have an automatic majority of the wholeHouse, which could be difficult to defend and less conducive to a responsible attitude in the House.-6-
12,      In theory, however, the Opposition Parties, together with CrossBenchers and perhaps even a few Party rebels, might combine to reject Government proposals.    It is therefore necessary to furthersecure the position of the Government, particularly in the last year of a Parliament.   While the Government could in the last instanceenforce its will by &quot;swamping&quot; (with the new composition it is unlikelythat many new creations of Peers would be required), the yearTs delayenjoined by the present Parliament Act should still be removed,     the commons could then pass the Bill again over the heads of the Lords ina new Session which could follow immediately.    Similarly, as suggested in Appendix I, the Commons should have the powerto over-ride the Lords on subordinate legislation.     These sanctionsshould give the Government sufficient control to ignore the theoreticalcapacity of a reformed House of Lords to thwart the will of the Commons.Conclusion13,      There is an opportunity for reform and the words in the manifesto enjoin it on us.     The Opposition are undoubtedly consideringreform and could produce proposals of a much less attractive kind thanthese.   On the other hand they will rightly fear that they would loseheavily if they did not enter into negotiation.    Whatever they might hope to save, it would be only the shadow, for we should not give wayon any major issue of substance,,14.      The effect of our proposals would be that the hereditary peers would immediately and totally lose their legislative power and wouldbe eliminated from Parliament altogether after a transitional period.At the same time the powers of the Lords would be so reduced thatthe elected majority in the Commons could always prevail.    TheHouse of Lords, thus reduced, could play a fuller and more usefulcomplementary role to the Commons, while in no sense being arival in power or authority.-7-
