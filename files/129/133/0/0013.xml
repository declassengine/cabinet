annex draft   WHITE   PAPERINDUSTRIAL EXPANSIONinductionThe Governments industrial policy is directed to stimulatingdencouraging the efficient use of national resources, both in the public and the private sectors.     In the Governments view,he success of this policy depends on the development of a closeorking partnership between the Government and private industry.tis generally recognised here and in other advanced industrialountries that, although competitive market forces can act ae aowerful spur to efficiency, they cannot in modern circumstancesrelied upon automatically to bring about the optimum allocationfour industrial resources.     Over the years there has been ateady growth in the scale and variety of Government support tothe private sector.     The Government believe that the rapid advanceof technology and the increasing force and complexity of inter-national competition demand still closer and more flexible co-operation between industry and Government.Mstine Partnership between Government and industry.   Such co-operation is not new.     In the past, direct government support for specific projects in the private sector has beengiven to older and less profitable industries, like cotton and shipbuilding, facing particularly difficult problems of adjustment to changed market conditions;   and to industries meeting some special national purpose, such as defence or regional development,Hore recently, the Government have provided finance for new andtechnologically advanced projects where the potential benefits to toe economy were greater than the returns which the companies concerned could expect to receive in the short--fcerm.

t5 examples of this approach.     Another kind of special action,amplified by the Ministry of Technology&apos;s pre-production ordersor machine tools, is to facilitate the introduction of advancedjuipment which is likely to be profitable, but which appears tojvolve too much risk for the customer until there has beenjperience of the new equipment.     Here the Government is reducingie marketing risk for the producer and the innovation risk for he customer.,  This has taken place at a time when Government and both sidesf industry have been concerned to evolve effective methods ofconomic planning.     Within this setting industrial policy hassen concentrated first on providing a series of measures designed3 shift resources of manpower and capital from less to morereductive employment and to even out the geographical distributionfindustrial activity;   and secondly, on providing assistance)? structural change.     Measures have been taken to encouragewestment in modern plant and machinery in the manufacturing,?ivate mining and quarrying and construction industries;   towrease the benefits available to industrial enterprise inivelopment Areas;   and to support technological research andsvelopment in civil as well as in defence industries.i   In particular, the resources of the NRDC have been enlarged&quot;as to enable it to support the development and exploitation. commercially promising projects within its scope.     The 1958-59&apos;s been set up to promote, and where necessary to finance, the&quot;Wictural changes which modern technology and international*petitive conditions require.     At the same time the Ministertechnology has been given authority to engage in or supportsearch and development and to further the application of thesuits.    These various powers have been used to good advantage1x1 the help given by the NRDC in the development of thevsrcraft, by the 1958-59 to reorganisation within the computer/industry-2-CONFIDENTIAL
Idustry and by the Minister of Technology in setting up the&apos;heme for pre-production orders for machine tools,^op^for further development of the partnershipBut it has become clear over the last year or so that theseiwers are not enough to enable the Government to take the quickd varied action needed to secure the expansion and fullerivelopment of our industrial capabilities.     This weaknessis emerged from the Governments consideration of stimulatingwth points in the economy and of counter cyclical action inidustry.A main purpose of the Ministry of Technology from the startis to identify key points of growth and to bring about a moreipid application of advanced technology.     The Ministry has wide&apos;iwers to support research and technological development but the;ope for exploiting the results is more limited.     If theivernment are to play their full part in the industrial expansionlich technological development now makes possible, they must be)le to operate more directly and more flexibly in support ofidustry to help overcome obstacles in production and marketingswell as in research and development.     In the wider context of the reorientation of research and development policy, the Governmentinsiders that there should be closer links between Governmentsearch establishments and industrial companies which can$loit and market the results of research.     On occasion-so the Government may need to establish a new industrialutility by themselves or in association with others.-3-
It is vital that companies should sustain their investmentogrammes which are designed to provide for a future growthdemand, at times when demand is not growing,     Any declinethe level of industrial investment may lead to drastic fallsorders in the investment goods industries.     As a result,ie industries concerned may have to reconsider their expansiond development plans.      If these are cut back and the employmentf engineers and skilled manpower reduced, the capacity of health  industries to meet investment demand when it eventuallyecovers will be inadequate.     If investment is to be sustainednd. expanded, means must be found to support demand in keyectors up to some agreed level and the Government mus t havelower to act quickly to provide the necessary support by theppropriate means.     The need for action of this kind in theflchine tool industry has recently been under discussion andithin existing powers it has been possible to help byncreasing the pre-production order scheme.     But ,more&apos;ar reaching measures to assist investment in this or anyither industry run up against the difficulty that theysquire legislation.     We shall find similar difficultyin introducing measures to remove obstacles to rapidMansion when demand is high,!&apos;   In addition to its main task of industrial rationalisation,there will be cases with which the 1958-59 can help through thekvelopment of individual enterprises.     The Government have close/and
i regular contacts with the Corporation and intend to use itsutilities to the full.    There will, hoi/ever, be cases involving trial development ,/here action by the 1958-59 will not beiitable.   i?or example, the amount of money involved may be tootore, or there may be a need for long term public participationfling from Government industrial or social policy.    The aircraftatostry and the shipbuilding industry are examples and considera-ions of this kind could, arise in schemes for internationaladustrial and technological groupings.    The Government mustserefore be able to take direct initiatives, in partnership withatotry, to promote the growth and modernisation of the economy.The further development of the Government&apos;s positive role asirtner with industry is therefore creating new needs for leg is la-ion to deal with particular situations.    Already, in the absenceinew general legislation, several separate Bills would beequired to cover the needs of the aircraft industry.    Furtheregislation may also be needed to amend the Shipbuilding Industryct in. the light of experience of the reorganisation, and to enablek development of aluminium smelting on which the Governmentate considering proposals.    Parliamentary authority may also beQuired to enable Government to promote further developmentsising from the industrial experiments proposed at the Prime&quot;lister1 s National Productivity Conference last June.I&quot;- The Government are not concerned solely with projects held up&apos; ^or lack of legislative authority.    The economic situationQuires that the Government should seek out opportunities forelping industry to grow and develop in the national interest, andthe Government are indeed turning attention to the prospects ofNoting future export growth by assisting development in industri/where ,.5
re the export prospects warrant it.    the government want toue it clear to industry that where a company is on the point ofRecess ful breakthrough in development, production or marketingis held up for lack of funds, the government will be ready totsider helping it over this hurdle and would have the power to bee to act quickly when the company and the government have agree the necessary action.    if this understanding exists, more projectsHii come forward for government support which at present wouldquire specific legislation.industrial expansion;&quot;billwhat is needed is a faster and more flexible parliamentaryocedure for implementing the government&apos;s side of its partner-ip with industry and a closer and more effective parliamentarypervision over government policy towards the private sector,deed, unless this is provided there is a real risk that thengestion of the parliamentary timetable could seriously delay theproduction of measures designed to strengthen and support industry.. the government therefore propose to introduce legislation to1/thorise the minister of technology and other ministers withsponsibilities for industries to provide direct assistance toiustrial projects designed to promote efficiency, to create,land or sustain productive capacity or to support technologicallvance.   under the bill which the government have in mind thenister concerned, with the consent of the treasury, would beipov/ered to give financial support to projects falling withinfined purposes of the bill.    in the case of the minister ofeiMology this would be a -widening of the scope of his powersyll the science and technology act 1965 for carrying on or[$porting scientific reseo,rch or the dissemination of the resultsscientific research, and under the civil aviation act 1949 tog^poro the design, development and production of civil aircraft.&quot;-new bill would enable the minister to support the design,^opment and production of other products in addition to civilg /aircraftCONFIDENTIAL
crrlt.Under such a Bill expenditure by way of loan or gr.-,nt couldunder! leen without further application to Parliament apart fromo normal supply procedure.    But special provision would be mader proposals involving commitments of uncertain amount or durationsas the guaranteeing of loans and the underwriting of risks,the subscription or purchase of equity capital.    In such casesiiiaictcr concerned would be required to define the particularoposals in a scheme to be laid before Parliament and to obtains approval of the House of Commons before proceeding with them., It is envisaged that schemes under the Bill will provide for s proposed acquisition of the Beagle Aircraft Company Limited,ich has already Been agreed with the industrial interestsaceraed, for the financing of Her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s share the production of Concord and,  subject to the conclusion offiliations now in progress, for the purchase of a Governmentareholding in the aircraft industry.5. fhe role of Parliament in the evolution of a closer partner-hip between Government and industry is of critical importance,parliament will need to play a fuller part than it has so farone.   The proposed Bill will provide the opportunity for parliament to dibcusa the statutory framework within which the partnershipnould develop.    The procedure proposed for obtaining ParliamentarySproyal for projects involving Government sharing of risk wouldpovide opportunity for these schemes to be debated.    Further thanfais Parliament will need to keep under review the development ofnfustrial policy to be sure that it is moving in the righthectioii and that the new responsibilities given to Ministers underullL are exercised effectively and within the time-scale requiredl.,.vhe pace of industrial event.    &apos;.&apos;ith these Parliamentary needs inlnd tlle Government will submit to Parliament suggestions for the3 -blisliment of a new Select Committee to be concerned withndustr^/Operational1^ Government&apos; s activities la the private sector of industry7
Deration of the new powersg    In the Governmentrs view the &quot;basis for co-operation withrivate industry is a common interest in industrial excellence andSoiBiercial success.     A successful private sector is essential ifigher standards of living, improved social conditions and a healthyalance of payments are to he achieved.     The Government wish toupport those enterprising managements which are striving to meethe challenge of growing competition at home and in world, markets,gild to maintain and improve the efficiency and profitability ofheir companies.7.   Government support for industrial projects can be justifiedn terms of their effect on economic growth and the balance oflayients although the return to the individual firm may not appearlarge enough or certain enough to justify its management inmdertaking a particular project on its own.     In such cases theiWernment are able to take a longer view based on the concept ofirofitability to the economy as a whole.      They can introduce into;he calculation the benefits which can be expected to accrue toither parts of the economy, but which may not show up in theissessment of the financial return made by the company consideringthe particular project.     This does not mean, however, that the division of Government finance for projects in the private sectorQould be subject to any less stringent examination than thatpplied to private investment or that in the nationalisedWlustries.     The economic return on every project will be carefullyupraised to establish its prospects of long run profitability.*   The Bill will not confer any powers to acquire shares in anyMustrial undertaking otherwise than by voluntary agreement.     Nor^0U^     confer any other compulsory powers either directly or/ indirectlyI-8-CONFIDENTIAL
idirectly, and the Government have no intention of compelling a firm to take part against the wishes of its management.     Thisnould clearly not accord with the purpose of launching successfulprojects.     It is inherent in this policy that the Governmentshould be selective in the support they give within the privatesector3 and the Government recognise that there may he concernlest they give preference to firms in which they have shareholdings.Though they have no such intention, they propose to discuss with industry whether any safeguards are needed on this score.     Thepowers to assist industry would of course he exercised with due regard to the Government&apos; s international obligations.inclusion19.    In the Government&apos;s view the proposed measure is bothnecessary and urgent if schemes for industrial expansion are notto be delayed.     The Bill will provide the framework for a furtherstage in the development of Governments partnership with industry for the encouragement of increased investment and more rapidapplication of modern technology.-9-CONFIDENTIAL
