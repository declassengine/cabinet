THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJEST&apos;Y&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. September 1967C (67) 1445th September, 1967CABINETA NATIONAL LOANS FUNDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerReview of public sector borrowing arrangements in my Budget speech this year I explained that, though I wasbudgeting for a surplus of ordinary revenue over ordinary expenditureof  642 million, the Exchequer would be left with an overallborrowing requirement of  938 million because of the need to borrowto finance Consolidated Fund lending, mainly to nationalised industries and local authorities but also to other public and privatebodies. So as to forestall criticism of the size of the borrowing requirement I emphasised that it was large this year because public investment would be rising at a considerable rate, but that in thecurrent economic circumstances large borrowing by the centralGovernment would not mean that an excessive level of total demand would be generated. In order to illustrate the significance of the borrowing requirement, I introduced a new table in the FinancialStatement on the capital transactions of the public sector. I expressedthe hope that the new presentation in the Financial Statement would help to remove misunderstanding, and I went on to say:&quot; I have also been considering whether the time is coming toconsider changes of substance. Is it necessarily the bestarrangement that so much of the borrowing requirement of localauthorities and public corporations is financed in the firstinstance by the Exchequer? The present arrangements have grown up as a series of ad hoc responses to particular situationsover a long period of years. I think that the time has come totake stock of the suitability of the present arrangements in thecontemporary world, and I have therefore put a review in hand.This will take some time and I will report my conclusions to theHouse in due course.&quot;2. Sophisticated observers and critics of course understand the significance of the Exchequer borrowing requirement in our present arrangements, but there is no doubt that some observers, overseas aswell as at home, do not fully appreciate the fact that the Exchequerborrowing requirement is not a revenue deficit, and thus misinterpretthe significance for our economy of the relatively large Exchequerborrowing requirements of recent years. An alteration in public sector borrowing arrangements which took some public sectorfinancing outside the Exchequer would not change the reality of the copy No.    0 d8208A
amount and economic significance of the total public sector borrowing requirement, and in that sense the objective in our review of public sector borrowing arrangements has been to achieve a presentationalrather than a real change. But the presentational change would havereal significance because the existing presentation is open tomisinterpretation, and thus can inhibit decisions which would havereal and beneficial effects. It can also be detrimental to confidence in our economic position and policies.3. This is particularly apparent in the arrangements for financing local authorities. At present about 30 per cent of the longer-term borrowing requirements of local authorities is financed by Exchequer money lent through the Public Works Loan Board(PWLB) and the rest has to be raised from the market. While weshould not necessarily want to eliminate all local authority borrowing from the market, at any rate in the immediate future, it wouldbe convenient from the point of view of market management to beable to provide more of the local authorities&apos; requirements fromcentrally raised funds and so to reduce the extent of their dependence on the market. The Government are indeed committed (under a white Paper issued in October 1963 (Cmnd. 2162), but endorsed by ourselves) to a policy of increasing the proportion of local authorityborrowing requirements raised via the PWLB. We have fallenbehind in our progress towards that objective, because local authorityborrowing has increased faster than we expected and because thelevel of Exchequer issues to the PWLB had already reached by 1965the level which in 1963 was not expected to be reached until 1967-68.I have refrained from making more money available to localauthorities through the PWLB not exclusively because of marketconsiderations but also because of the effect that increased Exchequerissues to the PWLB would have on the figure of the Exchequer^borrowing requirement which is published in the Budget.4. In the course of the review there has been a close examinationof the possibility of establishing a new agency to provide finance for nationalised industries and local authorities, or of encouraging the development of a new co-operative financial institution to financelocal authorities, on lines suggested by the National Board for prices and Incomes in their report on Bank Charges (Cmnd. 3292,paragraph 92). For reasons which are explained in an annex to thismemorandum I do not believe that a new agency or institution wouldprovide us with the right solution to the difficulties with which weare trying to deal. I am therefore commending to my colleaguesa different proposition. I believe that this would provide a means by which all our objectives can be met, but with considerably lessalteration to present administrative arrangements and disturbancefor market management and much less elaborate legislation than anew agency or institution would require.A National Loans Fund5. This proposition is for the institution of a new Governmentfund, separate from the Consolidated Fund and the Exchequer,which could be called the National Loans Fund. The argument on
which this is based is that the volume of lending undertaken by theGovernment is now so great, the range of bodies receiving loans isnow so wide, and the volume of market borrowing carried out bythe Government is, therefore, so large, that the time has come todeal with the borrowing and lending transactions of the Governmentseparately from other financial transactions of the Government, whichreflect mainly activities and policies for which the Government is directly responsible. Under this proposal, where the Governmentwas acting mainly as a financial intermediary and there was noquestion of final expenditure falling upon the Central Governmentthe transactions involved would be taken out of the consolidate fund and out of the Exchequer and concentrated in the new national loans Fund. The Treasury would be responsible for the new Fundjust as they are responsible for the Consolidated Fund. The treasury would account for the National Loans Fund separately from the consolidated Fund, and the National Loans Fund would have itsown cash account at the Bank of England, separate from theExchequer.6. The Treasury would have power to issue out of the fund the sums required for advances by Ministers to nationalised industries and other public or private bodies and for loans by the Public WorksLoan Board to local authorities. To preserve the principle thatthe new Fund was a financial intermediary and that there was noquestion of any final expenditure falling upon the CentralGovernment otherwise than as voted by Parliament, sums issued outof the Fund for lending to nationalised industries, local authoritiesand other public bodies would need to be lent on terms which wouldrecoup the capital lent and the cost to the Government of borrowingan equivalent sum for a comparable period in the market. any government loans which did not comply with those conditions wouldhave to be issued out of the Exchequer probably as a charge tovoted monies.7. The National Loans Fund would also become the sourcefrom which cash deficits in the Exchequer (whether seasonal orotherwise) would in the first instance be met. The Treasury wouldhave power to issue out of the Fund the sums required to meetexcesses of payments over receipts of the Exchequer; and to transfersurpluses of ordinary revenue over ordinary expenditure out of theExchequer to the Fund. The arrangements between the Exchequerand the Fund would be such as to ensure that the costs of servicingdebt incurred by the Fund in order to finance the Exchequercontinued to fall upon the Consolidated Fund.8. The Local Loans Fund would be wound up and its assets(outstanding loans to local authorities) transferred to the national loans Fund. Existing Exchequer loans to nationalised industries and other public bodies would be transferred to the National loans fund. The existing National Debt would be charged to the national loans Fund, and provision would be made to ensure that theExchequer recouped the Fund for the cost of servicing existing debtwhich was not backed by interest-bearing assets in the form of8208
outstanding loans to nationalised industries, local authorities andother public bodies. The Treasury would have power to issue fromthe Fund sums required for the repayment of maturing Governmentdebt.9. The concentration in the new Fund of all the transactions in which the Government acts as a financial intermediary wouldprovide an opportunity for the long overdue tidying-up andrationalisation of the Treasury&apos;s borrowing powers. The existingborrowing powers of the Treasury, scattered over a great many different Acts of Parliament, would all be replaced by a general power to the Treasury to borrow in such manner as they thought fit for the purpose of providing any money which the Treasury was empowered to issue from the Fund, and a requirement to pay allthe proceeds of such borrowing into the Fund. The limits on theTreasury&apos;s powers to borrow would thus be determined by the limitsset upon their powers to issue from the Fund, which would all be defined in separate legislation: e.g., the limits on borrowing powersof nationalised industries and the limits on PWLB lending laid downin successive Public Works Loans Acts (though this might provide an opportunity for simplifying the procedure for obtainingParliamentary sanction for raising the limits on PWLB lending).10. The new Fund, would be subject to audit by the comptroller and Auditor-General. The Treasury would be requiredto present to Parliament annual accounts of the Fund. The removalof lending and borrowing transactions out of the Consolidated fund and the Exchequer into the new Fund would necessitate a reform of the Exchequer accounts (also long overdue) with repeal of theexisting statutory requirements (including &quot; the line&quot;) and their replacement by new provisions suited to the situation of theExchequer after the Fund had been set up.11. The borrowing operations of the Fund would be managedin much the same way as the borrowing operations of the Exchequerare managed at present, and the processes of management of themoney market and gilt-edged market would be largely unaffected.12. No new body would be created. Responsibility for the transactions of the Fund would rest upon the Treasury. No change would be required in the statutory provisions or the administrative arrangements for issuing loans to nationalised industries and localauthorities, though administrative and accounting arrangments inthe Treasury and in the Bank of England would need some adjustment.13. The channelling of public sector borrowing through theFund would not be intended to affect the scale of public investmentundertaken. To the extent that local authorities enjoyed access tothe Fund instead of having to raise money elsewhere they would no doubt benefit in lower interest charges; but it would not beintended (neither would it be expected) that this would induce themto borrow and invest larger total amounts and so create additionalcalls on the resources absorbed by public expenditure.  The present
methods of controlling local authority investment, which areexercised mainly through Departmental programming of majorservices such as Housing and Roads, and by the issue of loansanctions for Miscellaneous Services, would not be in any wayaffected.Effects on local authority financing14. Decisions on the objectives in the field of local authorityfinancing and in particular on the rate of progress in achieving ahigher proportion of local authority financing through the PWLBwould depend on considerations of markets and market management and would not be inhibited by presentational considerationsconnected with the Exchequer accounts. There would be no statutory impediment to financing local authorities 100 per cent fromthe Fund through the PWLB; it would be for separate considerationhow far and how fast it was desirable to go in that direction. Thefirst step might be to allow an immediate and significant increase in local authority access to the PWLB, coupled with a declaration of intention steadily to increase rates of access to the Board thereafter,with the minimum disturbance to local authorities, market sources and the Government. If it was subsequently found desirable to finance the whole of local authority borrowing from the Fund, theTreasury would be able to borrow for the Fund on whatevercombination of instruments seemed appropriate from time to time,including short-term deposits as well as the more traditional gilt-edgedsecurities and Treasury Bills.Conclusion15. This proposal would achieve the objective of taking thegreat bulk of Consolidated Fund lending and all the resultingborrowing out of the Exchequer, and would thus remove theinhibitions on policy which their inclusion in the Exchequer accountssometimes creates. But the change would have more significancethan that. It would carry with it as a necessary corollary a reform of the existing accounting arrangements and borrowing powers; theeffect would be to put these arrangements and powers on a basis which reflected the realities of to-day rather than the financialorthodoxy of the middle of the 19th century. This would in my view be the main advantage, and indeed the main public justification,for the change. The proposal would represent a radical departure from existing conventions and practices in public finance in thiscountry, and in particular a departure from the principle, by which government finance has been governed for a hundred years or more,that the proceeds of all revenue and all borrowing should be paid into and all issues for whatever purpose should be made out of asingle Consolidated Fund.16. I should like to be able to take advantage of the benefits of this improvement in our financial arrangements in preparing andpresenting my Budget for the financial year 1968-69. Much further work needs to be done on the detail of these proposals and on thepreparation of legislation. I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will
agree that this work should now go ahead, with a view to thepreparation of legislation to be introduced early in the next session,so that we can bring the new National Loans Fund into being fromthe beginning of the financial year that starts on 1st April, 1968.L. J. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,25th August, 1967.annex public SECTOR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTSAlternatives to a National Loans FundA new statutory agencyConsideration has been given to a proposal that a new agency should be set up to take over the financing of the bodies which atpresent receive Consolidated Fund loans and itself to undertake thenecessary borrowing from the market. It was assumed that thisagency should be so constituted that it would be enabled to finance the whole of the local authorities&apos; borrowing requirements, including those now met by market borrowing as well as those met by borrowing from the Public Works Loan Board. Such an agencycould, of course, borrow only on Government credit and with aGovernment guarantee; it would in effect be a gilt-edged borrower.2. The establishment of such an agency would imply the setting up of a new statutory body, itself lending direct to nationalised industries and local authorities and thus taking over thestatutory duties and administrative functions now carried out bythe Ministers responsible for the nationalised industries and by thePublic Works Loan Board in issuing advances to the ultimateborrowers and in collecting payments of interest and repayments ofcapital from them. This would be likely to require additional staff as well as more complicated administrative arrangements, since theMinisters concerned would probably need to retain some controlover the advances made by the new agency. Moreover it would create formidable problems if the Treasury and a new agency wereborrowing independently in the market; the agency would therefore have to assume responsibility for the borrowing required to finance the Exchequer^ seasonal deficits.3. The setting up of an agency would thus involve a good dealof change in existing legislative and administrative arrangements which would be unnecessary for the purposes which it is desired to achieve, and would add substantially to the length and complexity of the legislation that would be required. There would be some danger of conflicting responsibilities; but, more important, our examination of the possibility of a new agency has suggested that
the functions which it would perform are so central to the exerciseof Government that it would be wrong in principle, as well asinconsistent with the real situation which it is desired to preserve,that Ministers should delegate these functions to a separate and independent statutory body.4. The establishment of an agency would not confer any facilities for or advantages in borrowing from the market whichwould not be available to the Treasury borrowing for the proposed national Loans Fund. Nor would there appear to be any greaterpresentational gain from transferring Government borrowing andlending transactions to a new agency than from transferring themto the proposed National Loans Fund. The conclusion is, therefore,that as compared with a National Loans Fund a new agency wouldnot confer any additional benefits or advantages that would justifythe additional legislation and administrative change that it wouldrequire.A co-operative financial institution5. Consideration has also been given to proposals which havebeen canvassed in several quarters, and which have recently receivedthe backing of the National Board for Prices and Incomes in theirreport on Bank Charges (Cmnd. 3292, paragraph 92), for aco-operative financial institution, borrowing from the market underTreasury guarantee and lending to local authorities. This would of course be only a partial solution to the problem: such an institution would relieve the Exchequer of local authority financingbut not of the financing of nationalised industries and-other public bodies. It would be raising very large sums of money, of the orderof  2,000 million a year if it took over all the borrowing requirementsof local authorities; it could raise these sums only if it borrowedunder Treasury guarantee. It would thus be a gilt-edged borrower,and the monetary authorities would be deeply concerned with themethods, terms and timing of its borrowing from the point of viewof market management.6. There is no reason to suppose that such an institution wouldbe able to attract savings that are not attracted into gilt-edged andlocal authority debt to-day. The problems that came up whennationalised industries raised stock issues in the market would come up in still more acute form and over a wider area. From the pointof view of market management such an institution would be tolerableonly if it were completely under the control of the monetaryauthorities. This would inevitably imply an obligation on thecentral Government to see the institution through by making funds available to it from the Exchequer when it was prevented by the monetary authorities from raising money in the market. Thecreation of such an institution would not therefore remove the riskof some liabilities falling upon the Exchequer in respect of the financing of local authorities. Moreover, an institution thuscompletely dominated by the central Government would commend itself to local authorities no more than other forms of financing bythe central Government: perhaps less, because it would have the
appearance of independence without the reality, and would offerthem no significant advantages as compared with borrowing fromthe Public Works Loan Board.Nationalised industry market borrowing7. Consideration has also been given to the possibility ofreverting to the arrangement whereby nationalised industries raisedtheir requirements by the issue of Government-guaranteed stocks.It is, however, clear that the reasons why that arrangement was abandoned in 1956 (which were described in the Report of the radcliffe Committee on the Working of the Monetary System(Cmnd. 827) paragraphs 86 and 87) are no less valid to-day than atthat time, and that the difficulties which such issues would createfor market management would be even greater now than then,because the amounts required have grown. A return to such anarrangement could not therefore be recommended.
