OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENT)13th September, 1967COPY NO.   65CABINETMIDDLE EAST;  CURRENT situation memorandum by the Seoretary of State forFjoreign AffairsArab/IsraelDuring August the parties to the dispute and the other powersprincipally involved were taking stock.     The Israel position hss if anything hardened.     The Israel Government insist that they will accepta change in the present situation only in the context of a peace settle-ment negotiated directly with their Arab neighbours.    On the other side, however, there is evidence that for the time being at any rate,President Nasser has put his weight behind the &quot;moderate&quot; Arabgovernments and that he might like to mend some fences with the West.Although the Arabs maintain their formal position of total non-recognition of Israel, the ltmoderates&quot; appear at least tacitly to accept that Israel is here to stay.United Nations Aspects2.     We have learned this week that the Americans do not expect theRussians to reply to their approach about a draft Security council resolution on the lines  they agreed with Mr. Gromyko in July, before mr. Gromyko reaches New York next week.    But from informalexchanges (which seem to be borne out by Lord Caradonrs contacts in new York) their impression is that the reply is likely to be rathernegative, probably mainly as a result of the response the Russians havehad from the Arab States.    They may now back the unacceptable Titoproposals, at least as a starting position.3.     Talks are to be held in London tomorrow, Thursday, withMr, Eugene Rostow of the State Department.    Thereafter, we shall haveto consider  whether, as Lord Caradon now thinks, we should encourage the non-permanent members of the Council to take the initiative.^-BSl     J^L^E0 3 a 14,     President Tito has approached us and others with proposals fora settlement on the basis of -(a) as a starting point, Israeli withdrawal from territoriesoccupied since 4th june(b) a Four-Power or Security Council guarantee of the security and 4th June borders of all the states in the area;-1-
(c) freedom of navigation through the Straits of Tiran pending a decision of the International Court?(d) a subsequent effort to tackle the refugee and Suez Canalproblems,,These proposals are objectionable to us in that they drop the directconnection which we regard as essential between Israeli withdrawal and the ending of belligerency by the Arabs, and postpone a solutionof the Canal problem.    Furthermore, the Israel Government hasrejected them as a basis for discussion.    The degree of co-ordinationof Yugoslav and Soviet views is not clear.The Arab Refugees5.     Despite strong representations from us, from the Americans,from U Thant and from the International Red Cross, the Israelisrefused, apart from minor concessions, to extend the 31st Augustdeadline for the return to the West Bank of those Arabs who fled acrossthe Jordan during and after the hostilities.    By the time those who are recovered by the Israel concessions have returned, approximately20,000 refugees will have been re-admitted, but more than 100, 000who asked to return will have been kept out.    Israel&apos;s rejection of applications for return to the Jerusalem area and to the Jericho campsmay signify that they are thinking in terms of a long stay on the WestBank and wish to limit their own refugee commitment there.Mr. Gussing, who is looking into the refugee problem on behalf of theUnited Nations Secretary-General, is expected to report in the nearfuture.    His report may give some pointer as to what form an inter -national contribution to settlement of the refugee problem should take.The Israel Government^ Commission on refugees is also expected toreport soon and there have been indications in the Press that the Israelline in UN discussion on refugees might be !tmore-accommodating&quot;.Jerusalem6.     The report of Mr. Thalmann, whom the Secretary-Generalappointed to look into the situation in Jerusalem, confirms that the Israelies have ignore the United Nations resolutions and have maintainedmeasures which in effect have incorporated the formerly Jordanian partof the City into Israel.    They have shown no willingness to go back ontheir public stand that the question of Jerusalem is not negotiable.Mr. Thalmann1 s report indicates that although the Arabs in Jerusalemwould be prepared to co-operate with a military occupation regimethey are opposed to civilian incorporation into the Israel State.    they regard this as a violation of international law which prohibits anoccupying power from changing the legal and administrative structure in an occupied territory.7.     Although the Israelis have shown anxiety about the possibility that the United Nations might call for sanctions against them on thequestion of Jerusalem, their latest communication to the united nations Secretary-General evades the issue of compliance with the twoGeneral Assembly Resolutions calling on Israel to rescind the measuresof 28th June.    It indicates readiness to negotiate only on an &quot;appropriateexpression of the special interest of the three great religions inJerusalem&quot; and suggests that this is the only basis of internationalinterest in the Cityts status.-2-
8.     So far the Egyptians have given no sign that they would be willingto take any action that would detract from the &quot;political, practical andpsychological effects&quot; of the principle that there will be no clearance ofany part of the Canal in advance of an Israeli withdrawal.     There havebeen indications that they would be satisfied with less than a full with-drawal from the Sinai Peninsula, but even in that event the re-openingof the Canal would not extend to the shipping of Israel.    The Israelisfor their part are likely to hold rigidly to the line that they will notwithdraw until the Egyptians abandon their claim to belligerency and open the Canal at least to their trade.    Although many countries, for exampleIndia, have expressed grave concern at the Canal*s closure, none of them has shewn willingness to try to bring substantial pressure to bear on the egyptians (or the Israelis) independently of action at the United nations or by the United States and USSR.9.     In these circumstances it would be unwise to count on an earlyopening of the Canal.    The most hopeful course of action lies probably in the encouragement of a comprehensive Resolution in the security council on the lines of the Gromyko draft.United Kingdom/United Arab Republic Relations10.    Apart from the general indication following the KhartoumSummit that President Nasser might wish to mend some fences with theWest, there has been a particular move towards Britain in the shape of an article by the Editor of Al-Ahram in the London Sunday Times on11th September.    He wrote that it was time for a genuine dialogue to begin, as between equals, between the United Arab Republic and theUnited Kingdom.11.     The United Arab Republic authorities have also announced their intention to resume the payment of pensions to former British servants of the Egyptian Government, and on 4th September they notified BOACof the restoration of its staging rights in Cairo.Oil12,    As a result of the resolutions adopted at the Khartoum Summitconference most of the Arab oil producing states have lifted the embargo on exports to the United Kingdom, the United States and west germany.    Algeria has not yet announced the raising of the embargobut has informed the companies concerned that the export of liquefiednatural gas to the United Kingdom may be resumed.    Syria, across whoseterritory the Iraq Petroleum Company&apos;s pipelines from Northern Iraqpass and where one of the IPCfs terminals is situated, has not yetagreed that exports to the United Kingdom, United States and west germany may be resumed.    Nor have exports from Tapline (the pipeline from Saudi Arabia to Lebanon) been restarted; the delay is dueto a dispute between Aramco and the Saudi Government over the level ofposted prices at the Mediterranean.-3-
13.     Meanwhile the Kuwait Government are already pressing theKuwait Oil Company (5 0 per cent BP, 50 per cent Gulf Oil Corporation)for a rapid increase in productions and, hence, in revenue in order toenable them to meet their new financial commitments arising out of theKhartoum Summit.    Iran, too, is pressing the companies to ensurethat there is no sudden drop in the increase in exports (which resulted from the Arab oil embargoes) and that the present exceptionally high level of off take should be taken as the base-line in deciding futureincreases.14.     The lifting of the Arab oil embargo has had very little effecton the United Kingdom except insofar as there is now once again agreater variety of sources on which we can draw.    In balance ofpayments terms the overall position of BP and Shell is affected verylittle.    The Suez Canal remains closed and the transport crisis, whichis the largest item in the effect on our balance of payments, is stillacute.G.B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1*13th September, 1967-4-
