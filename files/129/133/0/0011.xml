BEAGLE AIRCRAFT COMPANYi/memorandum by the Secretary of State for Economic affairs in December, 1966 (CC(66) 65th Conclusions, Minute 5), theCabinet agreed, having reviewed the earlier decision of July, 1966,to take over the assets of the Beagle Aircraft Company, to proceed withthe acquisition.     The financial implications of the proposal before theCabinet were based on a plan to develop and produce four types of lightaircraft:  two variants of the single-engined 2*-4 Seat Pup, the twin-engine 4-6 seat 3 242 and the twin-engined 6-7 seat B 206.    It was estimated that the programme would require cash subventions from public funds totalling  3. 2 million in the first five years to 1970-71and that thereafter there would be a positive cash flow.    Beagle havenow submitted a revised programme and new financial estimates which show a working capital required totalling  4. 5 million to 1970-71 with a positive cash flow thereafter.     The difference is largely due to a short-fall in B 206 sales and to the inclusion of new variants of the Pup and ofthe B 206.    In the current financial year Beagle will need some 1.25 million as compared v/ith the  0. 56 million forecast at thetime of the Cabinet decision.    A full review of the*Beagle programme and of results to date has therefore been undertaken by the Ministry of technology, with the result shown at the Annex to this paper.2,       The Minister of Technology&apos;s conclusion in the light of this reviewis that it would be right to continue to support the Beagle programme inspite of the so far disappointing sales of the B 206 and the extra financial support which will be required.    His reasons may be summarised asfollows:(a) It was realised last December that it would not be easy for Beagleto penetrate into the world light aircraft market and that, even if all wentwell, it would be several years before the Government could expect a return on its investment.    This is still the position and the Minister of technology does not consider that the overall financial prospects of thecompany have changed so markedly as to warrant reversing so recenta Cabinet decision,(b) Short-term fluctuations in cash flow are only to be expected.The programme should be considered as a whole taking one year with another.    Although a large cash subvention is now required in the shortterm, Beagle still expect to achieve a positive cash flow in 1970-71.     Therate of return on a discounted cash flow basis over 13 years is, on the expectation of higher profit margins on sales, now estimated to be 4. 6 percent as against the 4 per cent at the time of the Cabinet decision.-1-CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT)65C(67) 151 COPY NO._19th September, 1967CABINET
(c) The only respect in which Beagle&apos;s performance has so far fallenshort of the expectations is in the low level of sales of the 3 206, the onlyproject so far in production.    Nine months is too short a period in which to judge long-term trends,    (A single large order such as that under negotiation with the South African Government for 30 aircraft wouldtransform the situation).    Against this should be set the very encouragingreception which the Beagle Pup has received since its first flight in April.The Pup has already been chosen by the I-Ianible College of Air training to meet its basic trainer requirement, there is a good chance of an order for 50 from the Swiss Air Force, and it has aroused widespread interestfrom flying clubs and private flyers.(d) The Government has already put nearly  2 million into thecompany, i. e, over a quarter of the total cash requirement, and, ifwe did not go through the purchase of the company, we should, underthe terms of our agreement with Pressed Steel, have to make good any difference between the agreed purchase price of  1 million for the assets and the price they would fetch on realisation by Pressed Steel.     Thisdifference cannot now be quantified.(e) The decision to acquire the company has been announced toParliament and has been reaffirmed on several occasions.     TheGovernment1 s proposed acquisition of the company has also been widely reported in the Press.    It has also been mentioned to the confederation of British Industry (CBL) recently in connection withthe proposed Industrial Expansion Bill.    Withdrawal at this stage wouldbe embarrassing politically:  and it might lead to some unemployment.(f) At the time of the Cabinet decision it was recognised that newgood and efficient management was the key to financial success.     Itwas implicit in that decision that the new management would have tobe appointed and given a fair trial over a reasonable period before any considered reassessment of Beagle&apos;s prospects and performancecould be made.    After a long search, a suitable candidate has beenfound for the post of Managing Director and he is keen to take the jobon,(g) The Cabinet1 s decision to acquire Beagle was taken on wider considerations than that of the likely return on the Government investment.Beagle should make a useful contribution to the balance of payments.    Thecompany&apos;s turnover in 1971 is expected to be some  6 million of which by far the greater part v/ill go in export and the rest will be import savings.The Cabinet also considered it important that this country should maintain a stake in the very large and growing world market of light aircraft and recognised that Beagle provided the only chance of doing so.    If Beaglefails, we will be out of the light aircraft market for the foreseeable future.(h) Beagle&apos;s prospects of success did not depend on any majorpenetration of the United States market.     Their sales target of between400 and 600 aircraft a. year had to be considered in relation to an annualworld market of 12 to 15, 000 aircraft a year and a non-United Statesmarket of upward of 4, 000.    Beagle were only now beginning to try to sell the 3 206 to the United States.    It had so far been sold in six countries (excluding the United Kingdom).    It had also been sold inSouth America where it had attracted considerable interest and where
it was widely held that it was a better aircraft than its United Statescounterpart,,     They had also been sold to Australia which was anotherpromising market as was South Africa, which wanted to take 30 aircraft(this order is dependent upon American authority to re-export the(American) Continental engine).    The world demand for light aircraft was increasing by as much as 10 to 15 per cent a year.     Other countries were entering the market as manufacturers and it would be unthinkablefor the United Kingdom to back out only nine months after the announce-rnent of its decision to go on.3.      The Minister of Technology&apos;s proposals have been discussed inthe Ministerial Committee on Industrial Policy where there was abroadly equal division of opinion for and against the continuance of theGovernments support for the Beagle programme on the lines proposedby me Minister of Technology.4.       The arguments for abandoning the programme are as follows:(a) The estimates of the subventions the Government requires tomake in Beagle have risen considerably since the proposition was firstconsidered by Ministers,    In July, 1966, when the ministerial committee on Economic Development agreed that the Governmentshould seek to acquire the assets of Beagle the cash subventions requiredto be made to the company up to 1970-71 were estimated at  2, 5 million,and the rate of return on the investment (assuming the purchase priceoriginally proposed of  1, 455 million) was estimated at 6. 2 per cent over 13 years.    In December, 1966, when the Cabinet endorsed the july decision the subventions required had increased to  3.2 million and the likely rate of return had dropped to 3 per cent over 13 years on the July assumptions, or 4 per cent over 13 years assuming a reducedpurchase price of  1 million (which was subsequently agreed with PressedSteel the owners of Beagle).     The estimated cash subventions requiredhave now risen to  4. 5 million although the likely rate of return isestimated at 4. 6 per cent over 13 years assuming higher profit marginson Beagle&apos;s sales.     To support the Beagle programme at such a low rateof return would represent a waste of resources.(b) The advantages of the project have alv/ays been marginal from theGovernment&apos;s point of view, and the low level of B 206 sales since theGovernments decision to acquire Beagle must weaken confidence inthe prospects of the company5s eventual success.(c) The sales of the B 206 having fallen below expectation, it must now be doubtful - although sales forecasts are admittedly unreliable -whether enough aircraft will be sold to produce a positive net cash flowin 1971-72 as the revised financial estimates for the company suggest.There can be little hope of success unless the aircraft are sold insignificant numbers in the North American market, which accounts for some 70-80 per cent of the world market for light aircraft.    Butthe United States industry has the advantage of large-scale production,and Beagle aircraft would have to overcome heavy transport and tariffcharges in North America (as well as the competitive effect of theirrivals&apos; established after-sales service facilities).     The odds againstovercoming these handicaps must be considerable.
(d) The Government will incur greater criticism by continuing to backa project whose prospects seem to be deteriorating than by withdrawing from it before the commitment becomes too heavy.(e) The Governments communications with the Trades Union Congress(TUC) and the CBI on the proposed Industrial Expansion Bill has suggestedthat the powers would be used to improve the efficiency and theprofitability of promising companies, and that the economic return on every project to be supported would be carefully appraised to establishits prospects of long-run profitability.    It might be damaging to the credibility of this policy if the Government were seen to be backingthe Beagle project.5,      In the absence of any consensus of opinion in the ministerial committee on Industrial Policy I am referring this question to theCabinet who will wish to consider, in the light of the arguments,whether it would be right to continue to participate in the Beagleprogramme on the revised basis proposed by the Minister of Technology,&quot;O  qDepartment of Economic Affairs, S.W.1,18th September, 1967
JfKVTjM OF THE BEAGLE PlfOCRAMME1,    In the programme submitted to the Ministry of Aviation inNovember 1966, two variants were proposed, a club and a trainer aircraft,with launching costs estimated at  823,000 and a peak output of 150 ayear.    There was to be a margin of  200-4-00 on each aircraft depending on the type, with a break even point of about 2,000 aircraft sometimeafter 1980 (allowing for profit on sales of spares).2.    The estimated launching costs for these two variants have now risen to  1.0 million following a re-assessment of the design costs and ofthe allowance made for high initial production costs;   and proposals have been made for a third, larger, variant, with a total production for all variants of 200 a year.     Present and previous estimatescompare as follows - &apos;000November, 19.65 April 19g7B.121-100 (Club) 572 765B.121-150 (Trainer) 251 254,vv 3.121-180 (4 seat) - 309823 1,4083.    The Ministry of Technology has been through Pup production costs insome detail with the company, and it has been agreed that equipment fitshould be somewhat reduced but that prices should be maintained at aboutthe same level, giving bigger margins as follows (November 1966 figures in brackets) -( )StandardManufacturing fei?e ppmirdssipn H2  ?-nCost121-100   3,370 (3,710)     4,500 (4,545) 680 (635) 450 (200)121-150  4,095 (4,600)     5,550 (5,750)        830 (770) 625 (380)121-180   5,305 (   -   )     7,500 (   -   )     1,130 ( - )      1,065 ( - )K.   With these improved margins and a production rate of 200 a year,&quot;break-even would be achieved on sales of about 1 ,000 aircraft by 1 978(allo wing for profit on spares continuing thereafter).     If averagesales prices could be increased by some  250 an aircraft, break-evencould be achieved on sales of about 1,400 aircraft some two years earlier.-1-
5.     In fact, it nay not be possible to increase selling prices, sincethe basic production cost of the Pup is already for the most part higherthan that of rival American aircraft, which have the advantage ofproduction in considerably greater numbers.     This is not necessarilythe final determining factor since different types of aircraft in this category, though prjna facie comparable, tend to sell in reasonablenumbers over a fairly vn.de price bracket (as with motor cars), and sales of 200 a year by Beagle would represent only some 3 per cent ofthe world market (7,000 aircraft in this class were sold last year).The Pup&apos;s acrobatic capability, good handling characteristics andexceptional cabin width nay also prove strong selling points.6.    More recently, to improve the economics of the operation, Beaglehave proposed that the production rate should be stepped up to a peak of 400 B.121&apos;s a year by 1970-71? bringing the break-even date forward to 1974.     Sales at this level would require a 3 per cent penetration of the Worth    American market (which accounts for some 80 per cent of world sales), and a rather larger penetration elsewhere.    While this level of sales is not impossible, it will not be easy for Beagle tosecure even 3 per cent of the American market because their aircraftnust enter the United States over a tariff harrier (currently 10 percent, reducing to 5 per cent) and must bear transportation charges,together amounting at present to over  1,000 even on the cheapestvariant.     There are, however, potential military sales of the trainerversion and on balance the sales target of 400 a year is not regardedas unreasonable given vigorous and firm direction of the programme;   Inparticular   it will call for an energetic sales organisation and aresponsive dealer/distributor network which Beagle are only now in theprocess of building up.     The eventual size of the programme can only he decided in the light of sales experience.     The many expressions ofinterest that have been received, Including a promising prospectiveorder from the Swiss Air Force, and the decision of the College ofAir Training to order 22 Pup - 150ls, are encouraging signs.7.    To sum up on this project, the programme for the two smallervariants appears fully sound, experimental flying of the prototype is going well and has so far revealed no major snags, and. there are thebeginnings of a genuine market interest reinforced by the firm prospects of the College of Air Training order.     The introduction of the largerversion, the B.121-180, into the programme will be determined in lightof the development of the market for the two smaller versions.-2-
b^068.     Development of this 6 seat touring/executive aircraft selling at about  50,000 had already been largely completed before the Government&apos;decision to buy Beagle.     The provision for outstanding launching costsmade in the November 1966 programme has been reduced from  0.3 million to  0.2 million.     A total of 1+2 aircraft will hove been delivered by31st August 1967, including 22 &apos;Bassettsl for the Ecyal Air Force.Thirteen were delivered to the civil market in 1966-67 against a programme of 33-     This shortfall has led to a build-up of stocks and a reduction in income, resulting in a need for working capital inexcess of estimates.     The current level of orders remains disappointing.In their revised proposals Beagle have suggested a slightly lessambitious production plan based on achieving a peak rate of 50 a year in 1971-72, instead of the 60 a year proposed earlier.     Fifty a year would represent up to 25 per cent of the v/orld market for this typeof aircraft.9.     This may still prove highly optimistic, and the company1 s progressin selling the B.206 will have to be kept under close review.     Theposition would be significantly improved if Beagle were to secure anorder from South Africa (perhaps for some 30 aircraft) which has beenin view for several months.     The order is dependent on Americanauthority to re-export the (American) Continental engines to SouthAfrica.     This authority has been sought and the prospect of securingit seems to have improved in recent weeks.     Until the future of thispotential order is clear, the Beagle plan to produce no more than20 aircraft in the current year is the maximum which should becontemplated.10.   For introduction about 1970, Beagle have proposed a substantiallyimproved version of the aircraft (B.206/III) at an estimated launchingcost of  0.7 million.     Almost 100 of these aircraft would have to be sold to recover this.     This proposal is still being considered by theMinistry of Technology, and no decision has yet been taken.     It isnot certain that the sales prospects of the B.206 would be sufficientlyimproved to justify the investment involved,11. The November 1966 programme provided for launching the B.242(a twin-engine 4-6 seater) at an estimated cost of  770,000; fordeliveries to commence in 1969-70; and for production to reach a peak of 120 aircraft a year in 1972-73. Beagle have not yet putforward to the Ministry of Technology any specific B.242 proposal-3-&quot;Smrgnti.,..
CONFIDENTIAL lotarid in their latest programme they have set the project hack by over ayear to reflect this lack of progress.     However, they have also reduced the estimated launching costs (by  348,000 to  422,000) and have assumed that production will build up from first delivery in 1970-7&quot;! to 1 20 ayear by 1973-74.     This reduction In launching costs is based on an assumption that the aircraft will have much in common with the B.121;revised estimated manufacturing cos ts (reduced by  2,670 to  11,700)and selling price (reduced by  3,500 to  16,500) reflect this thinking.12.   It is important that Beagle should come to an early conclusion aboutthe design concept of the B.2L2;   an independent market study to aidthis is being considered.Summary13.   The November 1 966 programme required subventions from public fundstotalling  3.2 million over five years.     Beagle&apos;s revised plans(including the launching of two new projects - B.121-180 and B.206/lIl)and updated estimates of expenditure and receipts involve subventionstotalling about  4-5 million, or about  3.6 million excluding the new projects.     If peak production rate of the B.121 were doubled to 400aircraft a year by 1970-71j as Beagle propose, the required subventionswould amount to some  4.6 million.     The respective cash flow estimates,which all contain contingency provision of about  0.9 million are asfollows -1 966-671967-681968-691969-701970-71TOTAL NEGATIVECASH FLO&quot;./1971-721972-73November 1966927563805668- 213,178-v 185-:- 497Current^ j^ppPAfiJ-.&quot;(including newbVi^I/iM &quot;and&quot;X206/III)- 1,250- 1,248800- 686422 &quot;OOPCurrent Prop  gals(jTith 4PPBJ^21 &apos;s a-year)- 1,250- 1,300- 930- 840- 264- 4,406 (say 4,500)   - 4,584213486372664Conclusions&apos;4.   The longer-term production rates in the Beagle programme are to beregarded as no more than provisional targets, production commitments being undertaken progressively as sales experience shows them to be justified;the case for launching a new version of the B.206 has to be examined;   adecision has still to be taken whether to proceed with a 180 h.p. variantof the B.121;   and a design concept (with its associated estimated costs)has yot to be worked out for the B.242.   Nevertheless it is consideredthat there is sufficient information to enable a view to be taken in thegeneral programme. .-4-CONFIDENTIAL
