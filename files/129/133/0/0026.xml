iCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA. JESTY!S GOVER.NMENT)C(67) 166 COPY NO,24th October, 1967CABINETPUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerPublic expenditure commitments  or later years constantly rise,despite our Public Expenditure Survey Committee travails, because we take new policy decisions at regular intervals,,    In order that mycolleagues shall keep abreast of what we are involving ourselves in(including the likelihood of prunings at some latei date) I propose to circulate regular situation reports to the Cabinet.2,      It was as recently as July that we decided on the general levelof public expenditure in the light of the I/Iedium-Term Assessment,30      Nevertheless since then we have taken a number of decisions affecting public expenditure.    Some programmes have been rephasedQThe estimated cost of others has been revised.     The result of these changes is that expenditure in 1970-71 v/ill exceed the figure of  15,100million which we fixed in July by some  75 million,,    In other words,we have already used up virtually one-third of the contingency allowance for that yeir,4.       The largest single item in the increase is support for the coalindustry - some  30- 40 million in 1970-71.    Assistance to industryaccounts for another  5 million,,    Revised estimates for social security benefits add another  10- 15 million,,5.
