DOCUMENT IS THE PPvOPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67)14912th September, 1967CABINETTHE OIL situation memorandum by the Minister of PowerSupplie sThe Khartoum conference of Arab states removed on1st September the ban on oil supplies destined to the United Kingdom,United States o  America and West Germany.    This decision will not affect overall supplies to Europe which, as long as the Suez Canalremains closed, are limited by tanker capacity and may be increasedonly by the opening of the &quot;Tapline&quot; from Saudi Arabia to Syria or the resumption of exports from Nigeria.    It will however assist companies in the most economic programming of tankers and supplies, and so faras the United Kingdom is concei-ned it should enable us to obtain crudeoils better suited to the United Kingdom refineries.    A further gain tothe United Kingdom will arise when exports of natural gas from Algeriaare resumed, which we expect shortly.2.      In spite of the closure of the Canal there should be enough tankersto meet Europe&quot;s oil needs in the coming winter but at high cost.However the supply prospects will continue to be insecure so long as there is no settlement between Israel and the Arabs., and each Arab stateendeavours to obtain maximum financial advantage from the current situation.United Kingdom stocks3.      My Oil Industry Emergency Committee has just produced its first estimates of stocks and supplies over the coming winter as a whole,based on the main assumptions of closure of the Suez Canal throughoutand of no Nigerian supplies.    The Committee further assumed that theArab ban would continue^, but it has since indicated that the forecastswill not be changed significantly by the removal of the ban which willprincipally ease manufacturing problems in the United Kingdom and perhaps give a slight improvement in naphtha supplies.4.      The overall stock figures for the period from the start of the crisis until March, 1968 are attached as Table I.    Company-owned stocksbegan the crisis at 15. 3 million tons and dropped by 2.4 million tons(15 per cent) to their lowest point at 7th August.    They have since started to rebuild.    By 4th September they had reached 13. 9 million tons and byCOPY NO.     Jjj
end September they are estimated to total 1501 million tons, if- million tons (10 per cent) below normal  or the time of year.    With less thanthe usual seasonal stock rundown forecast for the last quarter of theyear, by end December the difference between normal stocks and the forecast level of 14. 7 million tons is only 5 per cent.    By end Marchstocks are estimated to be down to 12, 4 million tons, just over a million tons below normal but well above the minimum operational levels evenif there is a cold, winter.    These estimates represent a satisfactoryprospect in overall terms.Particular products5.      More detailed stock estimates, product by product, are attached as Table II.    Two-thirds of the shortfall on normal stock levels at endSeptember is shared equally between naphtha, where special measures are being taken, and the &quot;other products&quot; group where no problemshave arisen or are expected.    Stocks of the other main products are estimated at little below or at normal levels and present no difficulties.The shortfall on normal at end December repeats this end Septemberpattern.6.       Owing tc the loss in production of naphtha when crude oil supplies in general were cut earlier in the crisis, and so long as unsuitablecrudes have to be used, all the special measures being taken to dealwith naphtha still seem likely to be necessary.    However, there cannow be greater confidence that the naphtha demand and supply gap canbe closed, and this will be helped further when the supply of Algeriannatural gas is resumed.    I intend to keep a very close watch on thenaphtha situation.Temporary Surcharge7.      From rnid-August onwards the individual oil companies sent tomy Department revised cost figures in support of additional surcharges.By 1st September my Department had examined the situation in depth andhad prepared a paper for discussion with other Departments.    Then theArab destination ban was removed and companies have been asked tore-examine supply prospects and costs in the light of the changed circumstances.    The companies1 computer exercises are not complete,and thereafter there will be discussions with my Department which willtake several days.conclusion.      The oil supply position for the coming winter is now reasonablysecure, except in the case of naphtha, on which special measures are inhand.    In view of the improvement in stocks, we can now afford to relax some of the precautionary measures which have been taken in preparation for rationing.    There remains a possibility that a furthertemporary surcharge will be needed to cover the oil companies&apos; increased costs.    I shall be consulting my colleagues about this in the light offurther discussion with the industry.R.W. M.Ministry of Power, S.W.1.12th September, 1967
