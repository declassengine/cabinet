PUBLIC SECTOR PRICESReport by OfficialsIntroduction1,    On the 27th July, Ministers considered three papers dealing with public sector prices and nationalised industries&apos; performance following on the endof the period of severe restraint, (CC(67) 53rd Meeting, Item l\) .     It wasdecided that individual increases would be deferred pending a full study by officials of the general principles of pricing and target fixing innationalised industries, the application of these principles to individual cases, the best method of public presentation of increases and the desirabilityof establishing machinery to promote efficiency and cost reduction.2,    The present paper is the required study.     The paper makes generalproposals for a change in the degree of information available to Ministers inconnection with efficiency and cost reduction.     The paper also recommendsthe adoption, generally, of the practice of announcing the period for which individual prices will be expected to remain unchanged where prices have toho increased.     Finally, proposals are made for the handling of the presentprice increase proposals and for linking them to a proposed new Yi/hite paper on Nationalised Industries.PRICING- AND INVESTMENT POLICIES3.    The financial objectives set for nationalised industries have in themselves no particular economic significance.     They are meaningful insofar as they reflect, for a given industry, the results to be expected from theright pricing and investment policies.     Financial objectives are intended toexpress in a simple way the results which an efficient undertaking shouldachieve over a period of years;    and so to provide a basis for the industry&apos;commercial decisions and a yardstick of its performance.     Thus the financial objectives should always flow from pricing and investment - not vice versa.4.    The objectives (which are usually expressed as a given rate of return on capital) vary according to the circumstances of the industry-&apos;.     They allow for any social obligations falling on the industries and reflect theirdifferent trading conditions and the composition of their assets.A list of the objectives at present set or under discussion is at annex *A*.-.1-
5,    Although the Government have no statutory power to direct nationalised industries as to what they should charge for particular goods or services, itexpects them to base their pricing policy on certain broad principles.     Thus,the public utilities are not expected to charge prices which would maximisetheir surpluses, since this would amount to using them as an instrument oftaxation.     Equally, they must avoid keeping prices so low in relation tocosts as to create artificially a demand that could only be satisfied by further unremunerative investment.     Resources would then have to be diverted from more productive uses.6.     In general, nationalised industries are expected to cover their total costs, including service of capital and depreciation at replacement cost;and to achieve some surplus, which varies from industry to industry**.     Butit is not enough simply to achieve a prescribed rate of return overall.This could, for example, he done by massive cross-subsidisation ofunprofitable services which, insofar as it amounted to a tax on consumersof other services, would he as objectionable as a subsidy from general taxation.     A sound pricing policy requires that the prices of individualgoods and services should reflect the costs involved in supplying them and theeffect of demand in the market.     In applying this principle, nationalised industries are expected to take into account that when there is sparecapacity, short run marginal costs (i.e. the extra cost of raising output inthe short run) are likely to be relevant;    and that in the long run, the mainconsideration should be the industries long run marginal costs - that is, thecost of supplying, on a continuing basis, those services and products whoseseparate costing is a practical proposition.     The application of prices and incomes policy to public sector prices is dealt with in detail in Annex B.Investment Policy7.    In assessing new investment, the nationalised industries are requiredto show that it Is consistent with Government policy and will either yield asatisfactory financial return or be justifiable in terms of the wider costs and benefits involved.     Investment programmes must be framed in the lightof the Government&apos;s policy for the sector (fuel, transport, etc.) concerned.**Nothing in these principles will prevent the nationalised industries,in any situation where they have excess capacity, from seeking business at aprice below total cost so long as the business makes a contribution to fixedcharges.     The industries are, of course, free to pursue this course of actionalready and are encouraged to do so.     Off-peak tariffs are practical examples of its application.2-
The nationalised industries have certain statutory duties to meet demand;and they have to undertake some social obligations on which a full commercialreturn cannot be expected.     But except where investment is justified onwider social grounds, they are treated as commercial bodies and areexpected to contribute to an efficient allocation of resources by including in their programmes only those projects which provide a satisfactory rate of return.     The rate of return which new investment will earn with rationalpricing policies is in fact a prime instrument of control.8.     The industries are expected to use suitable investment appraisaltechniques.     In most cases these are discounted cash flow techniques, whichwere chosen after discussion with Departments, the industries and experts inacademic and industrial circles.   The current test rate, which sets theminimum return to be expected from a project undertaken on commercial groundsis 8 per cent which is broadly consistent with the pre-tax rate sought by large private firms on low-risk investments.Advantages of the present system9,    This system of financial objectives based on sound pricing and investmentpolicies has considerable merits.     It lets the industries know,r what isexpected of them by the G-overnment, and serves both as an incentive and discipline for management and as a standard by which success or failure overa period of years may be judged.     It distinguishes clearly between economicand social ends;    and encourages a rational use of resources.     Moreover Itgives the G-overnment sufficient control to ensure that investment, etc., istailored to national planning requirements, without Interference in day to day management.     It is  thus readily defensible to the Select Committee on nationalised Industries, the Prices and Incomes Board, etc.     To abandon the:present system under which objectives are related to investment and prices,and prices to costs, would therefore have serious disadvantages, bothpresentational and for resource allocation and management accountability.10.   The financial objective system also gives the G-overnment a perspectiveof the degree of self-financing which can be expected from the industries.If prices and investment, as reflected in the financial objective, are rightthe result is a demand on resources which should in principle be met.     if however prices are artificially held down, then, given the position that thelevel of savings is fixed and that savings and taxation must together coverinvestment, the ability of the industries to finance their investment would bereduced and the difference would he bound to he reflected in the form of increased taxation.     In addition demand might be artificially stimulatedloading to further uneconomic investment that would also have to be financed%. additional taxation.-3-
Risk^ t(D jthe^ gj^cjieguer fo11.   In this context it must be remembered that the figures are very big.A decline of only 1 per cent in the earning power of the total net assets of the nationalised industries means an increase of  110 million to be found by the Government - which is nearly equal to 6d. on the standard rate of income tax.     Over the last few years the nationalised industries have as awhole financed about half their new investment from internal sources and about half from borrowing.     This year the proportion of self-financing has fallen to around 40 per cent and borrowing on present forecasts will be up by about 140 million to the unprecedentedly high figure of  950 million.     In thisconnection it is relevant that the report on the medium term prospect whichT/as used as a basis for the recent public expenditure decisions (C(67) &quot;137)assumed a risjs in nationalised industries surpluses based on the investment and pricing principles outlined above, of  200 million a year by 1970/71.IMPROVEMENT OF THE SYSTEM12.   None of this is however to say that the system of financial objectivescannot be improved.     The G-overnmcnt has already decided that nationalisedindustries1 objectives should in future reflect more definite and explicitassumptions about the pricing and investment policies to be adopted and thishas been taken into account in recent discussions about new objectives for thePost Office, Electricity and Gas.13.   It is not enough, however, for the nationalised industries to payattention as the objectives now being evolved require, to the properrelationship of prices to costs.     It is at least equally important that theyshould keep the level of costs under continuous and critical review.     Thenew method of fixing objectives tries to take account of this by relating the objective not only to sound pricing and investment policies but also to a progressive improvement in efficiency and productivity over the target period.But there Is no agreed basis for estimating what the rate of this improvementought to be or for measuring progress towards it.     Moreover the appropriatecriteria, may vary with circumstances.^ ^fpr^m^rovement14.   iis general industriel experience shows, there are no exact ba.ses on whichefficiency can be measured or compared from firm to firm.     But techniquesin this field, as in that of investment appraisal, are developing and improving, and nationalised industries should bo expected to make use of thebest possible methods, so that their managements may judge how effectivelythey are taclcling the problem of cost-reduction.     Their use of agreed
systems of measurement, appropriate for each particular case, but with suchdegree of conformity and comparability as can be established, would enablethe responsible Departments to review with the managements their progress inthis field.     A good deal is already done on these lines by the industries and is used in Departments&apos; discussions with them, but there is room for improvement and the responsible Department must have sufficient information to form a judgment of an undertaking&apos;s performance in this direction for such purposes as settling financial objectives, assessing the competence of management and scrutinising borrowing requirements.15.   Some means of judging the scope for cost-reduction is also needed inthe context of prices and incomes policy.     In this the nationalised industries are, broadly,  subject to the same requirements as the private sector (See Annex B). The criteria for price increases in force since 1st Julyrecognise that increases may be justified in certain circumstances, but inevery case require prior effort to offset the need for increases by reductions in costs.     A nationalised industry invoking one of these criteria mustaccordingly be prepared to demonstrate to tho satisfaction of the minister concerned that everything possible has been done to absorb the unavoidableincreases in costs.16.   A responsible department.rt1.1ent&apos; s ability to judge the cost-effectiveness ofa nationalised undertaking is of special importance whan that body operatesin semi-monopolistic conditions and is not subject to the full pressure ofvthe market.     As the National Board for Prices and Incomes point out in theirreport on electricity and gas tariffs:;:, it is easier in such circumstancesthan it would be in a more competitive situation for a Board which has been unable to control costs to achieve its financial objective simply by raisingprices.     It Is, therefore, desirable that responsible Departments should bein a position to form an opinion of the scope for cost-reduction in any givencase.*cmnd.. 2862, paragraph 79.-5-CONFIDENTIAL
CRITERIA OF PRODUCTIVITY AIvD COSTS17.   No Board should be without the sort of indicators which the chief executive of a large industrial group would apply in reviewing theefficiency of the companies within the group; and these indicators shouldbe applied so that cliffioulties are anticipated before they occur and performance standards regularly, tightened.   The responsible Department shouldbe in a position to satisfy itself that the system is being so used.Type of system required18.   Techniques for examining costs and securing improvements in productivity are well established and in varying degrees are widelyused both in public and private industry.     They cover what are knownas performance indicators, the follov;-up of the effect of investmenton operating costs, and specific inquiries into particular broadareas of costs and expenditure.19.   Performance indicators are needed to cover all the main activitiesof an undertaking and can be grouped under the following headings:   sales,operating costs, maintenance costs, research and development, profit,current assets, total assets and return on investment.     Annex Gdescribes in more detail some indicators which fall under these headings.Usually the trend of the indicators is more important than the individualfigures, particularly the trend of variations between forecasts andactuals.     The successful application of this system calls for a prog-ressive tightening of standards of performance by means of targets of cost reduction set by the undertaking for itself.20.   It is important that management should be able to verify that whenlarge new investment has been undertaken, with cost reductions in view,the revenue budgets and performance standards of the undertaking areadjusted to take full account of the effects the investment is intendedto produce.     Otherwise the realisation of prospective benefitsadvanced in justification of the investment cannot be measured.21.   Many Boards already have good working tools for cost control andfinancial planning and in some cases these have been highly developed.In other cases Departments are aware of deficiencies and are taking-steps with their industries to repair them.     In our view the time has come to make it plain to the Chairmen of all the Boards that they
have a duty in this field to satisfy the responsible llinister that theyhave instituted,and are using,an up-to-date system of cost-control onthe lines sketched out above.     It va.ll he important to emphasise thatthis requirement is not intended to alter in any way the Board&apos;responsibility for management decisions;   and that its purpose is notto enlarge the field of Ministerial accountability for the nationalised industries&apos; operations, but rather to enable Ministers to carry out theirexisting responsibilities effectively.22. Departments are always entitled to ask for Information, and in this instance for enough information to judge whether the Boards are making a genuine effort to control and reduce costs.     In s this shouldnot give rise to any difficulty;   the Boards concerned are alreadyaccustomed to give the responsible Departments a great deal ofinformation and to discuss it freely with them.     In some cases, however,the Boards may, for historical or other reasons, he particularlysensitive about a possible diminution of their own responsibilities formanagement, a subject on which they rightly hold strong views.     provided the essential requirement of a properly used internal control system is achieved, there seems no reason to lay down a uniform pattern and theamount of information to be handed over in any given case can be left tothe responsible Department to work out with the Board concerned.Similarly, It will be for individual Departments to consider whether tointroduce any changes In their own organisation in Order to make full use of the information supplied by the Boards.An put side oif1c iency au lit23.    It has often been suggested, from both inside and outside government,that an &quot;efficiency audit unit&quot; would be a useful solution.     Such a unit,appropriately staffed, would examine the industries&apos; systems of costcontrol and performance indicators, make comparisons, suggest improvements and report to the Boards, to the Government, and where possible to thepublic.     At first sight this idea has a good deal of attraction:   itwould enable a body of expertise to be built up, and the unit would intime be able to make useful comparisons between the methods, standards and results of different industries in similar fields^.     In addition the existence of such an independent efficiency audit -would to someextent protect ministers from criticisms of interference in, and responsibility for, poor performance in the nationalised industries.:,,The French have a body with somewhat similar functions - the&quot;Commission de Verification des Gomptes&quot;;   hut we understand thatthis has had little impact.
2if.   There are, however, cogent objections to this proposal.     First, theamount of work involved in any detailed examination of the activities of thefourteen nationalised industries is enormous, and any such unit could not possibly supplant the many special studies done both internally and bymanagement consultants.     It could, therefore, be no more than a broadmonitoring body.     But this is precisely the role which the responsibleDepartments, in consultation with the central economic Departments,must play.     The responsible Ministers are answerable to Parliament on broad matters of policy and have the statutory duty of appointing board members and approving investment programmes.     They cannot abdicate fromthese responsibilities and to superimpose another body to monitor theindustries&apos; activities would blur the responsibility and createconfus ion&quot;.25.   For these reasons the better solution is to ensure that the responsible Ministers have available all the information they need todischarge their functions.     The best line of advance now seems to be forDepartments to develop farther the enquiries they already make on costs and productivity, towards a system of the type outlined in paragraphs 17-22above.     In this way it should be possible to build up a comprehensivepicture of the progress which the industries are achieving and to con-concentrate attention on those areas where further improvement seemsoverdue.     At the same time industries should be encouraged to make public the steps they are taking to ensure higher productivity and,v/here it would not impair their competitive positions, their eostreduction targets..IMKEDIATE PROBLEMS26.   The introduction of the control system described in the previoussection would be evidence of the Government1s intention to ensure that price increases by the nationalised industries are kept to the minimum.It should also help to induce a greater degree of cost-consciousnessin the public sector.     It will not, however, have any immediate impactoil prices.The various academic and practical arguments both for and against anEfficiency Audit Commission were fully aired before the SelectCommittee on the NI&apos;s.-0-
27.   There are currently a number of outstanding proposals for increases in prices or charges in the public sector awaiting decisions by ministers.     These cover a varied range of goods and services, and involve the Post Office, London Transport, British   Railways, the gas industry and Her Majesty1 s Stationery Office&apos;-&apos;.     The reasons forthe proposals are examined in detail in Annexas 3 and E.     In all ftasesthe proposals can be said to be consistent with the current principlesof prices and incomes policy;   the economic case for making the increasesappears to be strong;   and they are urgently needed.     This does not mean that they could all be made immediately.     The date of operation in most cases Is governed by the need for independent examination by NBPI(Post Office charges);   reference to statutory consultative bodies(e.g. gas prices);    or approval by a price regulating body (e.g. tons).Thus, in practice, if the increases were approved now they could not take effect simultaneously but,by a natural process of phasing,wouldbe spread over the year from October 1967-     Most increases would,however, fall In the first six months.     This phasing would not,however, prevent the proposed increases from attracting extensivecriticism over the next few weeks as soon as the preliminary proceduresin each case (e.g. issue of new tariffs by be (Parcels) Ltd.,reference to Consultative Councils, Transport Tribunal) were started.28.   The freeze and the period of severe restraint have delayed, forvarying periods, proposals for price changes and this has led to thepresent accumulation of proposals (the current electricity increase is of a piece with those now before Ministers).     Vie have examined the forward position and there is no reason to expect further major price increases from the big nationalised industries in the next twelveto eighteen months.     Indeed In the case of those where prices attractmost attention there is a prospect of falling long run costs as aresult of improved productivity and the massive investment programmesv/hich have been undertaken in these fields;   and the increases nowapproved (electricity) or proposed (gas and the Post Office) mightlast considerably longer than 18 months.*The special case of the proposals by the British Transport DocksBoard, among other employers of port labour, for increases in charges for work carried out by registered dockers is explained in Annex It is not discussed in this paper.-9-
29.   Nonetheless the reception given to the forthcoming increase in electricity prices shows how much care will have to he taken in the presentation of any further increases approved if widespread publicirritation and the impression that the Government is ignoring its ownprices and incomes policy are to he avoided.   The public reaction to price increases in the nationalised industries is not entirely rational.   Thepress tends to exaggerate their ecomomic importance (Annex G relatesnationalised industries prices to general domestic and industrial costs and prices); and the general public hlamos Llinistors   for not exercising thecontrol over the nationalised industries which they are widely, thoughwrongly, believed to possess.30.   Against this background we have examined various possibilities.We do not suggest that approval for the present increases should bearbitrarily withheld.   This would simply transfer the burden of cost increases from the consumer to the taxpayer \7ithout doing anytliing toincrease efficiency^ and might cause long-term damage to the sense ofmanagerial responsibility in the industries concerned.     In some caseslegislation would probably be required to pay subsidies since industries would be In breach of their statutory duty to break even.31 .   Me have considered the possibility of making it a condition of present approval that no further proposals for increases would be entertained - from these industries including electricity until the end ofI908.   This would have the advantage of simplicity, but it would create the impression that a further round of increases would occur at thebeginning of 19 69.32.   A better course would be to consider the circumstances of each industry.    In approving any particular increase the assumptions on which itis based will have been examined.   These should be made public and theperiod for which the increase is expected to last should be quite clearly stated.This would have a number of advantages -(i)    It would in many of the cases now under consideration mean thata future period of stability extending beyond 1968 could beexpected and announced,(li)   The forward expectation of stability would help planninggenerally especially in other sectors of industry,(iii)   The announcement of future expectations would give the nationalised industries a powerful long-term incentive to tackle the problem of cost control, and might well lead to animprovement on past performance.-10-
Such a course of action would be consistent with the system of financial control of the industries described earlier in this paper and with theprices and incomes policy.   If exceptional, circumstances arose which appeared to the industries to make a price increase necessary during theallotted time the onus would be on them to satisfy Ministers that someentirely new factor had to be taken into account.33.   There Is a further problem of presentation.   Proposals by individualnationalised industries for increases in their prices or charges tend notonly to attract publicity, as noted in paragraph 29, they tend to do so on more than one occasion.   It is thus important that the first publicitythat the possibility of increases receives, should put the need for these,and the Government1s decision to accept them,in proper perspective.   Thefirst occasion for publicity about proposed increases usually takes placev/ell in advance of the operative date and frequently in circumstancesoutside the direct control of the Government, e.g. v/hen proposals are referred to a consultative or price regulating body.34.  Where increases by a number of nationalised industries are concerned,as in the present case, it seems essential that the initial publicity shouldnot be left to the unco-ordinated efforts of the Boards concerned.   Onthis occasion the Government might themselves take the initiative in making an announcement.   This could cover all the impending increases as well asthe proposal to refer the case for increases in Post Office charges to theSBPI.    (No time need In fact be lost since it might be possible for the nbpi to do preliminary work before this reference is publicly announced *)35*   All these considerations inevitably point to some slight delay in authorising the batch of increases which are now proposed.   We recognisethat this will give rise to difficulty in some cases but we consider thatthis must be accepted in the interests of erasing an impression ofunconsidered haste and conflicting Government policies.       Wo considerthat Ministers will need to discuss with the Chairmen of the nationalised industries the development of the passages dealing with efficiency and cost effectiveness in the proposed white Paper on Nationalised Indus hideswith a view to incorporating the arrangements proposed in paragraphs 17-22abo ve. Ministers would at the same time discuss with the Chairmenfirstly the method of expressing publicly the future expectations aboutprice stability in each industry and secondly the nature of a generalannouncement on Government initiative.   The object of these discussions would be to clear the ground for a package deal which we think could bemade public in late September or early October.   The package would consistof --11-
(a) The new proposed draft Y/hite Paper on nationalised industries explaining the G-overnment policy^ relatingfinancial control of nationalised industries to pricing policy and dealing with efficiency and cost effectiveness.(b) A general G-overnment announcement about increased charges and why they had been approved and -(c) Statements related to each industry&apos;s circumstances, outlining the assumptions on which changes in prioe were based andthe future period for which prices were expected to bestable.The package would thus consist of positive proposals for reducing costs and containing prices in nationalised industries and a proper explanatin ofwhy increases in charges were necessary in some cases.Conclusions and Recommendations36.   (a)   The present batch of price increase proposals now before ministers should be the last for some while.   All the individual price increases appearconsistent both with prices and incomes policy and with the financial obligations of the industries.   Nonetheless, the impact of these increases,if they are announced and introduced piecemeal, is bound to lead towidespread public criticism.(b)   Accordingly it is proposed that Ministers should defer approvingany announcement of the current proposals for a few weeks pending -(i)   Expansion of the proposed White Paper on the nationalised industries liiiking the financial system of control as it hasevolved and the prices and incomes policy so as to incorporate the proposals for efficiency and cost effectiveness outlined in paragraphs 17 to 22 above,(ii)   Agreement on the time periods for which prices for each of theindustries are expected to remain stable and on the anticipatedfuture movements of costs and prices with a view to stating thesepublicly.    (Cases where future falls in price are expected will need to be brought out),(iii)   Negotiation with the Chairmen of the nationalised industries toreach agreement on (i) and (ii) above and on the content of ageneral statement by the G-overnment 0-12-
Confidential(c) The action proposed in sub-paragraph (b) above should becompleted in tine for the Government to present in late September orearly October a package deal consisting of -(i)   an explanation of its policies towards the nationalised industries highlighting the need for productivity, cost controland efficiency.(ii)   Announcement of approval of some proposals for necessaryprice increases.(iii)   A public statement about the future anticipated trend of costs and prices in these Industries and how long prices may beexpected to remain stable in each case.(d) At the same time, and on the basis of the r/hite Paper, departments would proceed to consult with their industries on the development of suitablecost control systems and indicators of efficiency.-13-

The Minister of Power announced on 19th December 1966 in answer to a Parliamentary Qeustion (OR Cols. 232-233) that the objectives to these two industries would continue in 1967-68.P.     The NCB were relieved of their objective temporarily inApril 1965 but this has now been revived and will continue in1967-68.
ANNEX BAPPLICATION OF PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY to public SECTOR prices the prices and charges of the nationalised industries are subject tothe power of the Secretary of State under the Prices and Incomes Act 1966,to refer any question of prices to the National Board for Prices and incomes and, in addition (with the exception of certain industries whoseprices are regulated by statutory bodies) to the powers in force fortwelve months from 12th August 1967, to require statutory notification of proposed increases, temporary stand stills and, In certain circumstances,reversion of price increases.        Apart from these powers, ministers have no statutory control over their prices.     Under informal arrangements in force for many years, however, it was customary for the appropriate minister to be consulted in advance about substantial changes in prices.These arrangements are now formalised by the inclusion of the principalprices and charges of the nationalised industries in the arrangements for early warning of increases in prices of economic significance.2.    Successive White Papers on the prices and incomes policy have made clear that the principles of the policy apply to both public and private sector prices.      The nationalised industries are accordingly expectedto have full regard to the criteria for prices behaviour applicable on a voluntary basis to industry as a whole.    Although Ministers have attachedconsiderable importance to Individual proposals being seen to have full regard to the criteria and, on occasion, to particular increases likely tohave a specially severe impact on the economy being temporarily deferred,the policy has not in general been applied more stringently in the caseof the nationalised industries.     To do so and allow the prices of the nationalised industries to get significantly out of line with costs would lead both to a waste of national resources and to heavy increases inthe amounts having to be provided by the Exchequer for new investment and, inthe case of industries in deficit, by way of deficit grant.     There was,however, in practice a temporary departure from this general policy duringthe period of standstill and severe restraint, in that the co-operationof the Chairmen of the nationalised industries in refraining from any increases in prices or charges during this time was sought.
3,    There is in general no basic incompatibility between the economic andfinancial considerations governing pricing decisions by the nationalised industries and the principles of prices and incomes policy, with the emphasis in both cases on the need to aohieve a more effective control of costs and improvements in efficiency.4,    The criteria for price increases, which have been in force since 1st July (the same as those in force prior to the standstill), recognisebroad circumstances in which price increases are unavoidable.     The first three of the criteria are concerned with circumstances in which increases in lahour, non-labour or capital costs per unit of output cannot be offset by reductions in other costs.    A nationalised industry invoking one orother of these three criteria must, accordingly, be prepared to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Minister, to whom early warning of proposed price increases has to be given, that everything possible hasbeen or is being done to absorb increases in costs that are unavoidable.5.    The fourth criterion, i.o. that after every effort has been made toreduce costs the enterprise is unable to secure the capital required tomeet home and overseas demand, is not directly applicable to the nationalised industries who look to the Exchequer to meet their residualcapital requirements (and, indeed, revenue deficits in certain cases).The fact that a target is not being met and that the industry is unable toget back on target without a price increase is not a Justification initself 8    What is relevant Is that if revenue has fallen below the levelrequired by rational pricing policies, this will produce the undesirableeffect of attracting too many resources to the particular industry.This may well show itself in the form of a fall in the self financingratio and an increase in the burden on the Exchequer.     In such circumstances,an increase in price may be justified, this being the nearest analogy tothe inability of a private firm to raise capital.(2)CONFIDENTIAL

There is some analogy between the way the Chief Executive of alarge group in the private sector controls the performance of hisindividual companies and the systematic review of costs and performance.of the nationalised industries as advocated in this memorandum.     this annex outlines (a) the type of indicators commonly used by industrialistsin the private sector and which are relevant for control of the nationalised industries, (b) necessary follow up investigations on large capital projects, and (c) specific inquiries needed occasionally tore-inforce the monitoring system.3.     The indicators outlined below are of a general nature and will therefore apply differently according to the nature of the particularnationalised industry concerned:    some indicators covering certain aspects of performance will be more relevant to one nationalised industry than another.     Nevertheless as far as possible it is desirable to avoiddissimilarity of treatment so that some degree of- comparability betweenBoards can gradually be built up.     In most cases the Important thingwill be the trend over a period of time rather than the absolute levelof the indicators, and also how actual performance 1ms differed fromexpectation.     Thus the most useful form of presentation for theindicators would probably be:(a) a graph showing the trend over the past five years,(b) performance in the period   just ended compared with the forecast at the beginning of that period, and(c) a forecast for the period about to begin.4.     Much of the data for the nationalised industries is readily avail-able.     Where data for the past is not readily available or wherecompilation would be too expensive trends would have to be established as time goes by.     In order to make a review of performance effectiveit will be necessary for responsible Departments to ensure that eachBoard has an efficient internal cost-control system and that proper useof that control system as a management tool is made by the Board.(1)

Performance^ jlndicators(a) Sales:    covering total sales and a breakdov/n over the principalmarkets and principal products or services.(b) P^erad^inja; Costs:    as far as possible separate figures shouldbe given for expenditure which is fixed and for that whichwould vary with fluctuations in output and sales;   it wouldalso include(i)   the levels of manpower in the main personnel groups, suchas operating, maintenance and administration;(ii)   labour productivity - e.g. output per man shift in thecase of the coal industry;(iii)   the level of plant utilisation;(iv)   the yield of output obtained from the principal rawmaterials used;(v)   the utilisation of any supplies or services which form a,significant part of the operating costs, such as electric power per unit of output in the steel industry.(c) Majntepanc^ costs:    including the relationship betweenmaintenance expenditure and the gross value of capital assetsbeing maintained, and (whore appropriate) the relationship between maintenance costs and output - e.g. aircraftmaintenance costs in relation to route miles flown.(d) Research and...Development:   possibly sub-divided between themain areas of study.(e) Profit:   before and after deductions for interest and depreciation and tax, both earned and forecast..CurrenJLAssets: analysed between debtors, stocks (includingraw materials, work in progress and stores items), and cashand other liquid assets.(s)   Total Assets employed:    including fixed and current assets.(h)   Re turr^ jm.

To ensure that investment is as profitable as it appeared to bewhen it was authorised it is necessary to ensure that the savings usuallyanticipated in the investment appraisal (i.e. which go toward the expected return on the new investment) subsequently materialise inpractice.     Thus there is a need for responsible Departments to see thatthe nationalised industries introduce new budgets and standards whichreflect satisfactorily their approved investment decisions.     This needalso exists where changes occur between the approval of a capitalproject and its completion.(2)
7.     Without this follow-up of the financial and economic effects ofcapital investment there is a danger that some Boards will tend to be over-optimistic in preparing their investment plans, thus causing an undesirable misallocation of resources in the economy.     Follow up, orback-checking as it is sometimes called, would identify whereover-optimism has occurred in the past and if over-optimism has beenhabitual on the part of certain Boards it may well suggest that departments should discount it when examining the current investment plans of those Boards.Specifip., Inquiries8.     On occasion specific aspects of the operation of a nationalised industry may merit special investigation, especially if the trend of a.particular indicator is seen to he falling below expectation.     Someof the more obvious possibilities whore inquiries in depth may he called for are given below:(a) more detailed analyses of sales and market shares;(b) progress in eliminating unprofitable products and services;(c) ensuring that targets for reducing costs exist and are being achieved;(d) examining whether expenditure budgets have been altered so asto reflect changed market circumstances;(e) assessing rates of stock turnover (the cost of carrying stocksis, on average, about 15 per cent per year of the value ofthe stock carried);   and(f) examining the relation between the value of outstanding debtsand the level of sales.(3)
ANNEX DPUBLIC SECTOl^ PRICESAPPLICATION OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES EXAMINED IN THEIZELIQRANDIM TO PROPOSED INCREASES JlT PRICES AY.AITINC- DECISIONPRICES OF HMSO PUBLICATIONS1.     Effect has been given to the increases in the price of HMSO publi-cations approved at the meeting on 12th July of the Sub-Committee on prices and Incomes (Pl(SC)(67) 13th Meeting, Item 3, Conclusion (ll)).A decision is required on the outstanding proposal, to increase theprices of all editions of Parliamentary Debates by 50 per cent.The loss on sales of this publication is customarily subsidised.     Thesubsidy has, however, nor/ grown to about  120,000 annually as a resultof increases in costs since the last price increase in 1962 and the growingvolume of Parliamentary business.     The proposed increase of 50 per centin prices would reduce the loss by I6.2/3 per cent, from  120,000 to 100,000.     HMSO are engaged as a continuing process in achievingimprovements in efficiency hut there is no possibility of reducing theannual loss other than by a price increase.     In the circumstances, theprice increase proposed would he consistent with the principles of prices and incomes policy.     As it is customary to give Parliament advancenotice of an increase, the necessary announcement and the effective dateoould not be before Parliament reassembles on 23rd October.BRITISH ROAD SERVICES (PARCELS) LIMITED CHARGES2.     A decision is required on proposals for increases in charges,averaging 7i per cent, for parcels carried by be (Parcels) Limited - a subsidiary of the Transport Holding Company.     Increases averaging5 per cent were originally proposed in June 1966, but were held, upbecause of the standstill.3.     A financial target has not been fixed for the THC, but they arerequired to operate as if they were a company engaged in a commercialenterprise.     Since I96L the return on capital employed by be (Parcels)Limited has declined from 21 per cent to 5 per cent, as a result ofunavoidable cost increases and a fall in traffic occasioned by thegeneral slackening in trade.     The proposed increases in charges are designed to bring the return on capital to 14ir per cent.     Although thiswould be below the rate in i96a, and also below the rate obtained by theTHCs biggest competitor in the private sector, the THC do not thinkthat anything more is achievable in the present competitive situation.(1)
4.     The last price increase was made in I965, when the Government agreedto an increase of approximately 4 per cent instead of the 6 per centproposed at that time by the company.     Since 1965 there has been anunavoidable increase in costs, of about 5 per cent overall, in such itemsas fuel, vehicle licences, insurance, supplies, rent and rates, etc.In the same period, despite every effort to offset rising costs by increased productivity, there has been an increase of 8.6 per cent in staff costs.     In I966 the company were caught by the prices standstillbefore they were able to increase their prices to take account of asubstantial wage increase earlier in the year.5.     The THC and its subsidiaries have made, and are making, very con-siderable efforts to improve productivity.     The Holding Company havereorganised their road haulage undertakings and substantially improvedtheir efficiency.     be (Parcels) Limited measure the output of everydriver and set targets for individual rounds and depots against whichperformance is compared.     Adjustments are constantly being made tomaximise the output of vehicles and drivers and close watch is kept onthe productivity of loading staff;    productivity in workshops will benefit from the reduction being made in the number of different types of vehicles operated.     Current measures by the THC to increase productivity include a thorough analysis of the relationship betweenmaintenance and replacement costs, which should result in betterutilisation of the fleet and greater economy of operation.6.     In this expanding but labour-intensive industry improved productivitywill itself depend very largely on the scale of new investment, but thecurrent rate of return on capital is too low for the company to ploughback profits on a sufficient scale to make a satisfactory contributionto investment.     In view of the unavoidable increases in costs thatcannot be absorbed and have already been borne for a considerable period and the inability of the company to make an adequate contribution to itscapital requirements, the proposed increases in charges can be regardedas consistent with the principles of prices and incomes policy.     the increases once approved would take effect about 6-8 -weeks later.LONDON PARES (BRITISH RAIL AND LONDON TRANSPORT BOARD)7.     Two fares increases for the London Transport Board and BritishRail in London have been held up for a considerable time.     They are -(a) an increase from 3d. to 3^d. a mile for certain journeys over10 miles, yielding  400,000 a year to British Rail;    the consequential increase for London Transport would yield 7,000 a year;(b) withdrawal of concessionary season tickets for youngemployed people, yielding  400,000 a year for British Rail,and  120,000 a year for tons.(2)
These two proposals, approved by the Transport Tribunal in July I966,were deferred because of the standstill have continued, following theend of the period of severe restraint, to be held up pending decisions about proposals for a major fares increase.8.     Proposals for a major fares increase for London Transport (with consequential increases by British Rail) were originally put forward at the end of 1966.     The Boards however -withheld applications to theTransport Tribunal at the Minister of Transports request.     During thecourse of this year revised proposals have been produced, and whenLondon Transport are authorised to go to the Tribunal they are likelyto propose Underground and Green Line fares scales in multiples of 6d.and with fares stages generally of 2-3 miles;    a minimum 6d. fare(l mile) for the buses, increasing by 3d. per mile up to 13 miles andby 6d. a mile thereafter;    and 7-9 per cent increases for most season tickets.     These increases would yield about  8.5 million a year for london Transport.9.     The British Rail consequential Increases have not been worked outin detail, but would probably yield more than  1 million a year.10. If the new proposals go forward, neither tons nor BR will implementseparately the proposal at (a) above, which will be incorporated in thenew scales.11.   The increases for the tons are necessary mainly becauoc of theirlarge and increasing deficits.     For the years I966-68 the totaldeficits will be about  30 million, of which only  16 million is coveredat present by Parliamentary powers for Exchequer grant.     The deficit in I968 would be reduced from  13 million to about  4.5 million if the fares increase could come into effect by 1st January 1968, but giventhe lengthy procedures involved in an application to the transport tribunal it seems increasingly unlikely that the increases could beintroduced as early as this.12.   The justification for the increases in terms of prices policy issimilar to that for British Rail.     The Board have made considerable progress with many productivity measures, some short-term and somelong-term.     There is also a Joint Review in progress (Ministry, Boardand independent members) similar to the BR Joint Steering Group, whichwill be making recommendations about a wide range of matters affectingthe Board.     It is already clear from these and other studies that theBoard must get their charges more closely into line with their costs,and that the longer the proposed increases are delayed the moredifficult it will be to achieve this.(3)
OTHER BRITISH RAILWAYS FARES amd CHARGES13.   A number of proposals by the British Railways Board for otherincreases in fares and charges are currently held up.   The total yield(including the London proposals mentioned above) would be approximately 9 million in a full year.   Details of the proposals other than theLondon ones are as follows.Countrywide Fares and Charges14,   British Railways wish to revise the scale of charges for parcelsand sundries.   The proposed increases range from 2-jjr per cent to 7-g- per cent,with an average of 5 per cent, and are intended to cover an increase in costs of 6 per cent since the last increase in the scale in January 1966.The sundries service has continued to make a heavy loss ( 25 million in1966) in spite of drastic reduction in the number of depots and rationalisation -sation of facilities.   The increases proposed take into account theproposed charges structure of British Road Services (Parcels) Ltd..(see above) and it is not expected that there will be any loss of traffic form rail to road.   The aim is to bring the new scale into effect fromthe end of October 19^7    The estimated yield in a full year would be approximately  2-g- million.15-   It is proposed to revise the scale of charges for coal and coke..There have been increases in costs of approximately 6 per cent since thelast revision of the scale in January 1966 and in spite of an extensiveprogramme of depot concentration and the introduction of improved handlingmethods, the traffic made a loss of  10 million in&quot;1966,   The proposed increases range from 2-g- per cent to 10 per cent, and the aim is toencourage the more economic train load operations, while imposing more realistic charges on some of the unprofitable traffic, particularly thatin individual wagon loads.    Large industrial users (e.g. CEGB, ICI,Portland Cement) have individual contracts with escalation clauses andwill not be affected by this revised scale.   BRB would like to bring the increases into effect gradually over a period of about three months.The estimated yield in a full year is approximately  2.3 million.16.   It is also proposed to revise basic rates of ordinary passenger fares outside London:   the second class fare would be increased from.25d to 3 per mile (a rise of 5 per cent) and the first class farefrom 4-87d to 5-27d (a rise of 8 per cent).   The increases cover thepart that cannot be absorbed of increases in costs since the rates werelast revised in February 1965*   These cost increases included 3^ Per&quot; cent(4)
pay rises in October 19&amp;5 an(i March 1967.   The Board also propose toexperiment with surcharges above the standard passenger fare on certainroutes and trains, just as elsewhere they offer discounts and reducedrates.   This flexibility of approach is vitally necessary in a verycompetitive field.    It will take between six and eight weeks before thenew rates could be brought into effect, and allowing for a 2 per centpassenger resistance the estimated yield in a full year would be  2.8 millionOther Increases17.   The increases in countrywide fares and charges referred to inparagraphs above were notified to the Minister of Transport underearly warning arrangements.    In addition, the Railways Board are planning to make certain minor and selective increases in other charges(e-g. car parking fees, pullman charges, motorail charges, freightlinerrates on certain routes, and in 1968 the withdrawal of reduced rates forsummer mid-week travel).   Early warning is not required for such increases and the Board were told by the Minister of Transport that they could go ahead.   They were subsequently, however, asked to defer action following the Cabinet meeting of 27th July, until a general policy on prices in thepublic sector had been agreed.18    If approval is given to the withdrawal of concessionary season ticketsfor young employed people in the London area (see paragraph 6(b)),British Railways would intend also to withdraw the concession outside london;   this would yield  250,000 per annum.19.   The BRB case for making these increases is strong,   It now seems probable that, largely because of the shortfall in freight revenue, the deterioration in the finances of the Railways Board in 1967 will be very substantial,   Present forecasts are that the deficit will be at least 15 million more than was budgeted for in the vote estimate ( 128 million).20.   The Railways Board have been under very heavy pressure from theMinistry of Transport to do all they can to increase efficiency and to contain the deficit.   Pay and efficiency negotiations between the Boardand the unions under the Minister of Labour, initiated by the Prime minister in 1966, are now in a very advanced stage.   A Joint Steering Group appointedby the Minister and the Chairman of BRB has been carrying out a detailedreview of almost every aspect of railway management, and the Boardthemselves are examining every possible way of further reducing working expenses.   However the original budget for 1967 envisaged economies at(5)
the rate of  18 million a year, and although this is currently being achieved, it is not easy to find further sources of saving.   The board have already achieved manpower reductions during the last five years ofover 32 per cent, and there have been even greater reductions duringthe same period in the number of stations (down by 43 per cent),locomotives (down by 53 per cent), railway wagons (down by 43 per cent)and other operational expenses.21.   As a result of these economies BRB have succeeded in absorbinga large part of their increases in wage costs during the past few years,but it seems clear that further increases in productivity alone will notsolve the Board&apos;s problems and that the Board have no alternative but tomake these increases in fares and charges.   The Railways Board are ofcourse operating in an intensely competitive market, both in passenger transport and in freight, so that there is no fear of their exploitinga monopoly position.   The price increases proposed seem fully justifiedagainst the first and second criteria for prices and incomes policywhere cost increases exceed capacity to absorb them.   Moreover, as theindustry is unable to meet any of its own capital needs, the raising of increased revenue from fares and charges can be justified against thefourth criterion, namely that after every effort has been made to reducecosts the enterprise is unable to secure the capital required to meethome and overseas demand.GAS PRICES22.   The proposals for early increases in gas prices are complex and areexamined separately in Annex E.POST OFFICE CHARGES?3.   The Prices and Incomes Committee on 26th July agreed that thePostmaster General8s proposals for raising additional revenue of 30 million a year from posts and  35- 40 million from telecommunicationsshould be referred to the National Board for Prices and Incomes(PI(67) 17th Meeting, Item 2).   This would involve increases intelecommunications charges in April 1968 and in postal charges in theautumn of 1968.     The reference has not yet been made pending a decisionon the financial objective for the period after 31st March 1968 to T*e takenfollowing consideration by Ministers of the present study by officials.   Asit is intended that the case for the proposed increases in Post Officecharges ahould be investigated independently by the National Board for prices and Incomes, and as this investigation will inevitably have regardto the progress made and substantial work and studies in hand to improve efficiency in the provision of Post Office services, the justification forthe increases against the current criteria is not examined in thisnenorandum,(6)CONFIDENTIAL &apos;
confidential annex E 1 0 2GAS prices    SUMMARY AND RSCOjI^pATIONS1,   The problem of gas prices falls into three parts(a) The general financial position of the industry,(b) The additional costs the industry is incurring on account of theMiddle East crisis.(c) The special position of the South Eastern Board.2, This note examines each of these aspects in turn, sets out the choices opento Ministers, and makes recommendations as follows:-(a) The financial position of the industry is weak and justifies a price increase.     Of three alternatives, officials recommend Ministers to choose the middle course, that is, an increase of 5^/o on average.(b) The gas industry is incurring heavy additional costs as a result of theMiddle East crisis.     It is recommended that the industry impose animmediate surcharge of about 2rp on the price of gas (over and abovethe basic average increase of 5&quot;g7fa), making a total recommended increaseof about ?g)o.     The Middle East Surcharge would be removed when theindustry has recouped its additional costs in full, but would need tobe charged over a longer period than that of the crisis.3.   Officials believe that this solution would most nearly meet the conflictingsiis of policy, and, with suitable presentation, would be more acceptable to cuePublic than would the alternatives.k   If Ministers agree to a general price increase, it should be announced assoon as possible in order to affect demand, and hence naphtha requirements,this winter.&apos;   The following recommendations are also made:-(c) Gas coke prices should be increased from 1st November so far as market conditions permit.In view of special circumstances, the South Eastern Gas Board&apos;proposed price increase should be approved, even if the recommendations on a general price increase are not accepted by Ministers,(e)  A new financial objective for the industry, related to medium-termprospects, should be formulated.
- 2 -g,   Whatever decisions on gas prices are taken, cars will be needed in handling the public announcement of the price increase ( see paragraphs 26-36of the main paper) .        To a large extent the public presentation will dependon the choices taken by Ministers, and it is recommended that this question should be considered later by officials in the light of the decisions to boby Ministers on the nature and scale of increases in gas prices.
CONFIDENTIAL j j.. 3 -THS GENERAL PPTANCTAL POSITION OF THE MDIBTRTThe urgent question is the level of the gas industry&apos;s earnings for the res;this year and next.     Sven ignoring temporary factors (ill below), theresent financial position of the industry is weak.     The industry as a wholemid have expected a surplus of only  1 m. this year in relation to a turn-ter of  540 m., and a deficit (after paying interest and depreciation) of  7 m.jxt year (1967/69).     i&apos;iven if it were decided that, because of the specialactors mentioned balow, Boards should, be expected to do no mors than break evenpresent circumstances, a. number of Boards would have to raise prices soon,the industry is required to put anything to reserves the increases required,ould be larger and more extensive.     At present, and quite apart from theiffects of the Middle Last, 8 Boards, i.e., all except the Scottish;, SouthAstern, West Midlands and Southern Boards, wish to increase prices as soon as:possible by amounts ranging from 4^ to 8 per cent, but the size of the incroosusiventually proposed, will depend on the guidance the Boards are given as to t .3;financial performance to be required of them.iliat surplus..(if Jgvv) should the industry be aiming at in present circumstances?ii   The industry&apos;s present financial tbjective, originally fixed for the periodIS62/67, and temporarily continued for the year 1 567/68, is 10.2 per centdeluding depreciation.     This is equivalent to 6.2 per cent after depreciationceapared with 6.8 per cent for electricity).     The G-overnment has stated its intention that this objective should be progressively assimilated with that ofileitricity, for which no new financial objective has yet b;-.en agreed.I   The question of the temporary financial objective that the gas industryfeild now aim at raises in an acute form the clash between considerations ofSource allocation and accounting costs.     The gas industry while part way;lrough one revolution, the change from coal-based, to oil-based gas, is fa.ced*ft another, the change to natural gas.     This is already involving it in yb.ryiulstantial capital expenditure *n distribution mains and further heavySpenditure will begin to be incurred next year on the conversion of consumers&apos;:Ppliances.     Converting the industry to natural gas is expected to cost well 1,000 m. in the next five years.     The capital charges from this investatjai1,including deferred charges from conversions) will begin to fall on the industry1immediately and thus worsen its financial position before substantiallefits begin to flow from North Sea gas.
- 4 -0   It is arguable that from the economic standpoint these costs should be paid&quot;or by future consumers rather than present consumers, otherwise prices will-ive the wrong signals to consumers choosing between competing fuels.Optimum resource allocation requires prices to follow the trend of long runmarginal costs1&quot; and thus to take account of the substantial reduction in gassupply costs expected when North Sea gas arrives in quantity.     This would help the industry to achieve the rapid expansion in its market that will be necessary if all the available natural gas is to be absorbed in the early 1970&apos;s.     Onthis view a reasonable compromise between considerations of long-run marginalcost and of financial proprietor would be achieved if the gas industry were required to break even in 1968/69 or at the most to maintain its existing target..11,  Nevertheless, if this increased market is to be achieved, there is from thefinancial standpoint a strong case for raising prices immediately, because Z-asBoards&apos; finances will undoubtedly deteriorate further during the period of transition to natural gas.     The industry&apos;s long-run costs are at presentunknown and the absence of profit now will not necessarily be offset by increasedprofits later, because some of the benefit of lower costs may have to be passed on to existing as well as new consumers, if the natural gas is to be absorbed.She rapid expansion of the industrial market will involve offering gas to largeconsumers at vary low prices so that while the expansion of demand is taking-place, there will be a substantial loss of revenue amounting to several millionpounds a year for a Board with a large existing industrial load.     Boards maybe unable to pursue the necessary expansionist policy if they enter the natural gas era in a weak financial position, and to this extant, a price rise now willhflp rather than hinder absorption. SiiiL-i^^^&amp;is^ry^ach^ve^a satisfactory ^financja,! j^erf ormance without price increases?&quot; * * &quot;       &quot;  *&quot; &apos;  &quot;&quot; &apos; &quot;&apos;2.   whatever decision is taken about the level of financial performance theindustry should aim at, the question arises of how far it could achieve thatThe recent draft Yiliite Paper on financial and Economic Objectives sets outtne principles as follows:It is therefore desirable that prices, in addition to recovering costs, shouldth re^s?nfl)1y related to costs at the margin and should be designed to promotecq6 ?^cj-fnt usa 0-r resources within industi-y ....

While the industry is showing substantial improveents in efficiency and is extending its use of modern management techniques,here is no way by which the industry&apos;s progress in this direction could beuddenly speeded up so as to obviate the need for the price increases nowequired.3,  Even with the use of modern management techniques it is possible that someoards may not maintain a sufficiently vigorous determination to pursue everypportunity to reduce costs and increase efficiency.     Though some reduction mayrove possible when particular proposals are being scrutinised, however, theye unlikely to be sufficient to affect substantially the average price increaseequired for the industry as a whole.at are jhjLZractioal Alternatives?V  In practical terms and leaving aside the effects of the Middle East, theree three broad choices open:-(a) to increase the industry&apos;s financial objectives to 6.8 per cent netso as to achieve a surplus of  25 m.     This would entail an Exchequerfinancing of 72 per cent of the investment in 1968/69 and an average increase in price of 7^ per cent;(b) to maintain existing objectives (10.2 per cent gross, 6.2 per cent net)for a further year so as to achieve a surplus of  16 m.     This meansan Exchequer financing of 75 per cent in 1968/69 and average pricejincreases of 52 per cent;(c) to allow the industry to cover depreciation and interest only, thatis a 5 per cent net return.     This would mean Exchequer financing-rising to 80 per cent and average price increases of 2 per cent.Aese are averages, and for individual Boards there would be variations.5.  The choice taken should achieve a proper balance between the conflictingeeds of, on the one hand, a strong financial position to meet the problems ofhange and expansion over the next few years;   and on the other, conformityith present prices and incomes policy and the achievement of the best possible&apos;se of resources with expansion of the market.     The Departments concernedelieve that the best balance between these conflicting objectives would bechieved by adopting choice (b) above.     At the same time the present dilemmaiines the necessity of formulating, a nev; objective for the gas industrybating to medium term prospects (this is necessary-y for electricity also);CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENT! AL- 6 - Mis will take some months.     In the meantime, developments in the Middlest have complicated, the situation.The average rise in gas tariffs if choice (h) were adopted, and if as isoposed in paragraph 25 below, a 7% surcharge were also made in respect of thecreased costs arising out of the Middle East crisis, would be about Igfo&apos;,or different Boards, the average increase would, lie between andThe opportunity would also be taken to remove existing discrepenanciestariffs which have resulted in the prices charged to particular types ofonsumer not always fairly reflecting the costs of supply.     This means thator domestic consumers in general, the rise would average  10.3$.     For theulk of consumers, the range of increases would lie between 3% and 18j$ut there would be special cases lying outside this range.     For instance, in;he extreme case of the consumer whose consumption is so small as to renderupply completely uneconomic&quot;, the cost could be doubled.     On the other hand,few large industrial consumers would get small reductions rather thanincreases,oke PricesI?. In addition to raising gas prices a number of Boards also propose tonorease coke prices, in most cases from 1st November.     To apply therinciple-s of prices policy, as set out in successive TJhite Papers, to a jointroduct such as coke, one must first establish what is meant by the cost ofTOduction.     Where, as with gas, the main product can be produced in two ways,iK involving a by-product and the other not, the &quot;cost of production&quot; of the hy-Iptoduct is properly regarded as the price at which it needs to be sold to equatecosts of the two methods of making the main product. On this basis coke isa present being sold far below its &quot;cost of production&quot; and it would be reason-able for Boards to soek increased revenue from coke where market conditions soIPermit. To the extent that they are able to do so, the gas price increaseswley will need in order to achieve the financial objectives set for them will beWaller.*This extreme case is of the consumer who has, probably, a B^%?JP^^S*^ used only occasionally, and who therefore uses only one or two therms ajjiartor*** are very few such consumers.

On ^0P       &apos;c-10 wsak financial position already described, the gas industryis at present incurring substantial additional costs as a result of theItiiddle East Crisis.     These consist not only of the additional 2d. a gallon0n the cost of its supplies, but also the cost of all the expedients that theindustry is having to adopt to mitigate the consequences of the shortage ofnanhtha.     The best estimate that can be made at present is that the totaladditional cost would amount to about , 25 m. over the current financial year,jhis estimate takes no account of the possibility that the surcharge on oil mayhave to be increased.     The gas industry has proposed that its additional costsshould be met by an immediate surcharge of 8 per cent on the price of all gas,that the other price-increases proposed (apart from those of the SouthEastern Board and coke) should be deferred until the industry&apos;s ifnancialposition following the and of the crisis can be foreseen more clearly.     Theindustry has proposed an equal increa.se for all Boards, because it is its intention to share the additional cost between Boards as far as practicable, sothat the most efficient distribution of the available supplies of gas is notimpeded by financial considerations.19.  The gas industry is not alone in facing additional costs on account of theEddie East.     The oil industry, which is of course in a special position, hasalready been allowed to pass on additional costs.     The Government has sought to persuade other industries faced with increased oil bills to absorb these costs as far as possible, but an industry that could not do so could justifiably claim the right to raise prices.     Following a recommendation &quot;by the N.B.P.I. the(Government has accepted a surcharge on cement prices on account of increasedQil costs.     The gas industry is in no position to absorb its cost increases byfatting its profits, since it is, apart from the Middle East crisis, doing-little better: than breaking even.     A surcharge, passed on at a time theadditional costs are being incurred, is in accordance with the principle chatvprices should reflect coots.     As the N.B.P.I. pointed out in somewhat similar:0Wcurastances in their report on the Scottish Gas Board (Cmnd. 2862) &quot;a^&quot;iporary surcharge ..... would indicate to consumers that it arose from short-Tl-ria difficulties and ought not therefore to enter into their calculations&quot;ten taking long-terra fuel decisions.&quot;CONFIDENTIAL
- 8 -20. There are three possible ways for the industry to recover the substantial additional costs it is incurring as a result of the Middle East situation:(a)   an outright Exchequer grant.(d)   a temporary surcharge to recover the Middle East costs more or less asthey are incurred, leaving the permanent price increase to beintroduced when the surcharge goes (this is the gas industry&apos;suggestion).a surcharge of about 2%, added toa basic price increase of 5^o,sothat the Middle East costs would continue to be recouped for some time after the Middle East situation returns to normal.21. In evaluating these alternatives the following considerations are relevant:lead to pressure for similar- treatment for other interests hit by theMiddle East crisis, in which case it would be difficult to findreasonable grounds for discriminating in favour of the gas consumer.with the expected long term trend of gas supply costs, nor with recentdecisions on prices and incomes cases;    also, a surcharge added to abasic price increase would tend to postpone some decisions to convertto gas this winter when the gas industry may well face an acutesupply problem because of the shortage of naphtha feedstock.(c) On the other hand, to superimpose a relatively high surcharge(designed to recoup the full Middle East costs as they are incurred.)on the basic price increase, which officials consider justified, would almost certainly be unacceptable on prices and incomes grounds.(d) As far as public presentation is concerned it should not be toodifficult   to justify a surcharge because the causes are easily under-stood by the public.     On the other hand the gas industry&apos;s suggestion of a relatively high surcharge subsequently replaced by a permanentprice increase would require two sets of price increase announcementsperhaps within a few months of each other and would be highlyunwelcome at the present stage of development of prices and incomes policy.(a)An Exchequer grant would put the burden on the taxpayer.     This couldA surchargwhich would be removed later would not be inconsistent
CONFIDENTIAL- 9 -and, (e)   If a surcharge is introduced it would be necessary to ensure thatBoards subsequently remove it after the Middle East costs have beenrecouped.22.  In &quot;the light of these considerations Ministers are recommended to choosecourse (c) - a surcharge of about 2% - as being the best means to recoup theiliddle East costs falling on the ga,s industry, since it would(a) reduce the full impact of Middle East costs (which could otherwise be heavy) on the gas consumer next winter.(b) avoid the need for two sets of price announcements,and  (c)   (together with the basic price increase) discourage some conversionsto gas next winter.Thus the idea of spreading the Middle East costs over a longer period hasconsiderable merit, even though it may never be possible to recover the wholeof these costs because gas prices to industry will have to come down well beforethe end of that period to expand the market.IV   THE SERIAL POSITKF OF THE SOUTH EXTERN BOARD23.  The South Eastern Board is a special case, in as much as it first proposed a price increase in June 1966.     It was held up by the standstill and period of severe restraint, and has now been held up further while the wider question of nationalised industry prices has been under consideration.     For various reasonsGovernment action has already imposed an excessively long delay for which thereis no statutory authority.     The Board made a deficit of  2.7 m. last year andexpects to make a similar deficit this year, even without taking account ofadditional Middle East costs.     The Board has represented strongly that dovernmenaction is preventing it from fulfilling its statutory duty to balance its booksPeking one year with another.Zk.  The Board&apos;s proposed increase of about 8 per cent is intended to yield separately of return about equivalent to its present financial objective.     whatever decision   is taken about financial objectives for the industry as a whole, this board nueds an increase and needs it urgently.     In view&apos; of the heavy losses toxts reserves over the past 18 months, the increa.se proposed is in no wayexcessive, nor should it impair the Board&apos;s ability to absorb North Sea gas.In Vlew of these facts, and of the long delay to which the Board has already-Mn sub0ected, it is recommended that Ministers should now agree that this BoardCONFIDENTIAL

ANNEX PPUBLIC SECTOR PRICESCHARGES BY THE BRITISH TRANSPORT DOCKS BOARD1,    Proposals have been received from many employers of labour at the ports, including the British Transport Docks Board, for increases in charges for work carried out by registered dock workers.   These proposals are the result of increases in labour costs consequential on theintroduction from 18th September of the scheme for the decasualisationof dock labour.   In deciding to implement this scheme, Ministers took account of the estimate that labour costs would increase by an averageof 16 per cent over the country as a whole.2.    There is a wide variation in the increases proposed by the variousharbour authorities and other employers of dock labour who have submitted proposals so far.   The range is from k- to 35 per cent and in two caseshigher.   A number are about 25 per cent to 30 per cent.   The increases proposed by the British Transport Docks Board average 16 per centalthough, as in the case of the other employers of dock labour, there are substantial variations.3. It is not expectected that either the British Waterways Board orthe Port of London Authority will propose any increases in charges atthis juncture.4.     The British Transport Docks Board do not cover a major part of theport industry in this country.   Moreover, they are not the only employerof registered dock workers in their own ports;   in the case of nine ofthe Board&apos;s fifteen ports, separate proposals for increases have beensubmitted by private employers.   In the circumstances, it does not seempracticable to deal with the proposals for higher charges by the british transport Docks Board in the context of the present review of the general principles governing public sector prices and separately from theproposals by private employers.
ANNEX &amp;THE IMPACT OF NATIONALISED INDUSTRY PRICE INCREASESPrivate Budgets1,    The effects of an increase in nationalised industry prices on the retail Price Index is relatively small.     In the index the goods and services of the industries have an aggregate weight of 8-9 per cent.     the table below shows the weights of various sectors.   (Air fares are not inthe Index.)Retail Price Index, January 1 967 J^gi^ts^T^talJ^Op^Electricity 23Gas 11Coal and Coke 26Rail Fares 7Nationalised BusFares (approximately)     10Postage aTelephones k-2,    Thus the effect of a 10 per cent rise in charges in all these sectorswould be to raise the retail price index as a whole by almost exactlyone point, i,e. three quarters of one per cent,Indus[trials Cost;s3.    Using 1963 input/output figures, it is estimated that approximately6 per cent of total industry inputs are purchases from the nationalisedsector.     (Gas, electricity, coal, rail, road, communications.)     the impact of a 10 per cent increase in prices would be to raise industrialcosts by approximately three quarters of one per cent.     (This figure includes a multiplier effect of coal prices on gas and electricity but does not take account of similar multipliers which occur elsewhere.)4.    The effects on particular industries would vary widely from theaverage.    Fuel and/or transport cost increases would be of relativelygreater importance to, for example, the iron and steel, chemicals, cementand construction industries.     For other industries the effects would hefar less significant.
