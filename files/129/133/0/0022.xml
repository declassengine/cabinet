RHODESIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Secretary of State for Commonwealth AffairsThe attached paper by officials contains a thorough reappraisalof the Pvhodesian problem.    We asked them to examine critically theprospects for our present policies and all conceivable alternatives.2.      This seemed the right moment to do so.    Our most recentinitiative, the Alport mission, appears to be running into the sand.The visit to Africa by the Commonwealth Secretary, promised by thePrime Minister at the time of the Alport mission is due to begin on25th October,3,      We have to face the fact that economic sanctions have not so farbrought about the necessary political change and there is no immediate prospect that they will do so, while South Africa continues to supportthe Rhodesian economy.4.      In Rhodesia itself we have to reckon on the possibility of thedeclaration of a Republic, which might drive the Governor intoretirement and make any subsequent constitutional settlement moredifficult.    In addition we face difficult decisions in our arms policy towards South Africa which are closely linked with our approach to the rhodesian problem.5.      This is an uncomfortable position which is doing damage to both our political reputation and our balance of payments.    We thereforecommissioned this enquiry to find out if there were any ways to cut theGordian knot.6,      The officials Paper considers a wide spectrum of conceivablecourses from the use of force at one end to settling on whatever termswe can get from Smith at the other.    We believe both these extremecourses must be ruled out.7.      The political and practical arguments against the use of forceremain overwhelming and indeed are stronger now than when they were originally rejected.    In any case the end result of an attempt to solve the problems in this way given the racial tension which exists in Africacannot be foreseen.8.     An alternative course to force is a major intensification of sanctions to the point of facing economic confrontation with South africa and Portugal,    There is no reason to revise our view that this would impose a severe and unacceptable degree of damage on the British economy.9t      At the other end of the spectrum, settlement on any presentlyavailable terms from the Smith regime would involve the surrender of ourdeclared principles and the breaking of our public pledges.    It wouldsplit the country, probably break up the Commonwealth and certainlyharm our reputation throughout the world.
10.      We therefore recommend that the right course is to perseverewith our existing policy, that is (a) maintain sanctions (and where practicable secure increased effectiveness in their appHcafcion) and (b)maintain also our posture of readiness to reach an honourable setfclemenin accordance with our principles.11.     In doing so we ought to recognise certain realities.    Sanctionscan be made to bite more effectively in a number of ways at present being studied (e.g. Commonwealth pressure to bring third countriesup to our level;  travel and passports, etc. ) but given the South Africangap there can be no major intensification that will produce swift results,.12.      We may therefore be in for a long haul, though equally we ought not to rule out that if we show the will and determination to stick by our stated policy and maintain even limited sanctions the certainty of prolonged isolation and the difficulty of obtaining serious developmentcapital may bring about a weariness amongst the Rhodesian europeans and a willingness to come to acceptable terms.13.      But if this does not happen over the next year or so we may haveto accept that the Rhodesian problem will turn into one of that numberof international problems with which we have to live without aforeseeable solution.    There is fortunately some evidence that anumber of Commonwealth and other countries are beginning to accept that both force and economic confrontation with South Africa are out for us; we should be able to meet the remaining pressure on us in these directions provided we make it clear that we are standing firm on ourprinciples.    But here too we should have to accept that the fact of our responsibility for Rhodesia would make the indefinite continuance ofthe present deadlock much more uncomfortable for us to live with than are those other insoluble international problems for which, though wemay have great interests at stake, we do not have the same degree of direct responsibility.14.      While maintaining this position we ought to stand ready wherever the opportunity offers to explore the possibility (analysed in the OfficialPaper) of the South African Government being willing to put pressure onthe Smith regime to reach any form of settlement which would accord with our basic principles.15.      Nor would we wish to rule out in the longer run, despite itsdangers and difficulties, the possibility, also examined in the Officials1Paper, of divesting ourselves of sovereignty over and special responsibility for Rhodesia (perhaps by means of transferring them tothe United Nations).G.B.G. T.Foreign Office, S. W.l.16th October, 1967
RHODESIANote by Officials^PRESENT . situation it is nearly two years since the illegal declaration of independence;    it is getting on for a year from the imposition of mandatory sanctions &quot;by the Security Council;    and there is wide-now or in the foreseeable future, in producing the necessarypolitical change in Rhodesia.2,    Sanctions have succeeded in reducing Rhodesia&apos;s exports from 165m. in 196fj to a current annual rate of about  90m.    As aresult they have also caused a fall in the general level ofeconomic activity in Rhodesia of about 15%.   But the effect overthe economy has been uneven and in general the Europeans thereare in no danger of suffering any great hardship.    The furtherimpact of the existing sanctions on Rhodesian trade is likely tobe small, although the effects of the decline which has already occurred will result in some further contraction in economic activity.    One reason why sanctions have not had a greater impactis, of course, the refusal of South Africa and Portugal to applyeven the mandatory sanctions at all;    the inability of some of rhodesia&apos;s African neighbours (especially Zambia) to cut offtrade with Rhodesia altogether;    and the somewhat lax manner inwhich some countries are policing their traders behaviour,especially over minerals purporting to originate in Rhodesia&apos;sNeighbours rather than in Rhodesia itself.    The last of theseActors has probably done more damage by the encouragement it hasSiven both Rhodesians and the outside world to believe thatActions are noc working than by its actual assistance to rhodesia&apos;s export earnings, useful though that undoubtedly is.-J is in this field that our own efforts to secure a stricter^Plication of sanctions are chiefly exerted.    The efficacy ofspread and growing disbelief in the effectiveness of sauctions,/those
those efforts is likely to diminish with time unless thegovernments concerned &quot;believe that a strict application of sanctions would bring about a solution of the Rhodesian problem.On the whole it seems unlikely that the decline in Rhodesianeconomic activity will continue indefinitely and within the nextyear or so it is possible that the Rhodesian economy will begin to pick up again.   Development will be held back but there is little prospect of economic breakdown.3,    All reports indicate that most Europeans in Rhodesia aregrowing increasingly bitter against Britain, and that events inother parts of Africa have intensified their fears of what would happen in Rhodesia if majority rule came about    Against this background, it is clear that the great majority of the european population in Rhodesia, whatever their views on the wisdom of the illegal declaration of independence;, are firmly with the regime in resisting the pressure of sanctions and in refusing to give up &quot;independer.ee&quot; except in order to have it promptly rucognisedby us on terms which would put off majority rule for a considerable time, if not for ever.Meanwhile opinion among the Rhodesian Europeans is evidentlyshifting to the right, and this process is likely to be accelerated by the terrorist incursions from the north.    Some timeaext year - perhaps in the spring - the regime may declare are public,,   This would, have no legal validity, but it would makethe regime even less willing than before to agree to the kind of settlement we could accept.    It would also probably be theccasion of the Governor1 s retirement from the scene, supposing that he had stuck to his post until then, and this would removeOno of       potential assets in Salisbury and increase thetechnical difficulty of restoring constitutional government.    Inltt(inion, the declaration of a republic might lead some at least0a ^e dudges to accept the regime as the de^facrbo or even the-ilHEg government of Rhodesia.    It is possible that some of the/Europ eans
Europeans who at present acquiesce in the regime&apos;s policies wouldbe repelled by the declaration of a republic, and as a result &quot;bersiore inclined to oppose the regime than hitherto, though on pastform we cannot expect that they would express their disagreementvery effectively.    On balance, we do not think that time is onour side.PHDSIrT? ?0IJC;.h?3.5,    Vie have been following two separate but related policies,One has been to seek &quot;by means of sanctions to weaken the determination of the Europeans in Rhodesia to maintain their&quot;independence&quot; in the hope that new Headers would appear.   Theother has been to pursue the possibility that, as a result ofthat process, we can reach an agreed settlement with the present regime consistent with the principles we have laid down.   Withinthe limits we have had to set., neither policy has been sufficiently successful to solve the problem.    The refusal ofSouth Africa and Portugal to co-operate in the &quot;sanctions policy has meant that sanctions have failed to exercise decisivepressure on Rhodesia.    Our attempt in the &quot;Tiger&quot; talks tosecure an agreed settlement produced an outline solution which  /ould probably have he en acceptable to a majority of theEuropeansj   hut the right-wing minority had enough influence onthe regime - both in the Cabinet and through the party caucus -no engineer its rejection.    Since then the regime&apos;s position hasevidently hardened against- such a settlement.    For example, inxke exchanges that have taken place since Lord Alport&apos;s visit,we have been trying to find out what were the changes in the&quot;Tiger&quot; constitutional proposals which Mr, Smith told Lord Alport510 thought should be made;    the regime have declined even to^ve any indication of their views on that point unless we firsta8Pee to abandon Nibmar and clearly would only agree to our^ing a test of acceptahility of an independence constitutionthis were done while they remained in power.
g    Although these two policies are logically compatible and indeed inter-dependent, there has been in practice a tendency for each to weaken the impact of the other.    It is true thatthe effect of sanctions in halting development and economic expansion in Rhodesia has helped to make some of the Europeansthei-e desirous of a settlement, but this has not been sufficientto make them want one on terms we could accept;    and sanctions&apos;have also had the effect of making most Europeans in Rhodesia.,even these politically opposed to the illegal declaration of independence, feel that they must stand together against outsidepressure.   At the same time, our attempts to reach an agreed settlement with the regime have tended to give the impressxen tothese Europeans in Rhodesia who, like the Governor, believe thatan agreed settlement is essential, that there is more chance of reaching one by pressing us to make concessions than by pressing the regime to do so0COURSES WE COULD CONSIDER7.    In the following paragraphs we examine the followingcourses of action:(i)   at one extreme, to make an ail-out attempt to bringabout the fall of the regime -(a) by the use of force;    and/or(b) by a major intensification of sanctions,including their extension as necessary to south Africa and to Portuguese territory;(2)   at the other extreme, to negotiate a settlement with the regime on such terms as they would agree to;(3)  to persevere on our present lines;to attempt to secure South African support in pressing on Mr,  Smith and his less extreme supporters a settlement which we could accept;^)  to accept that no solution of the problem is available tous and to seek instead to divest oiirselves of our special/responsibility
responsibility for Rhodesia, and perhaps to transfer theproblem to the United Nations.fiSKJI^FORCE8    Except in special circumstances such as a general breakdown in public order in Rhodesia requiring the use of British troops to restore it, and making their introduction at the Oovernor&apos;invitation possible, with a secure point of entry and no opposition from the Rhodesian armed forces, Ministers have always in the pastruled out the use of force.    This has been because of the political difficulties which its use would cause, and because of thepractical difficulties of providing the large forces required and of mounting such an operation.    We consider that the considerations, both political and practical, which have ruled out the use of force in the past are even stronger now, nearlyfro years after the illegal declaration of independence.   Thereis also the point that if, despite everything, we did use force,and in effect went to war against the regime, we, should be leftto deal afterwards with the problems of a country with a brokeneconomy, hostile Europeans and a lawless African community,,    nor could we be sure of what the South African attitude would be, orjthat of the Portuguese or of the African countries on which weshould depend for bases.I^MJNTEN^IFIGATION; Og SANCTIONS;5-   So long as the Rhodes.ians can use South African and^ozaabique ports as channels for the exports of embargoedcccifloaities and also for imports (particularly of oil), the effectiveness of sanctions cannot be sufficiently increased to^uig about the result we are aiming at.    Even if wc could closell? the Mozambique ports, the effectiveness of sanctions would not^sufficiently increased so long as South African ports remained-liable.   The South Africans have repeatedly made clear that1,1 are not prepared to shut off this channel for Rhodesian-tfade.   The only way to close it would, therefore, be by some/ form
f0rai of embargo on South African, trade as well.    In a recentotter Lord Caradon has reported that there would not besufficient support in the Security Council at the moment for)resolution calling for a United Nations blockade of Mozambiqueor trade embargo against South Africa.    Even if the necessaryresolutions could be passed in the Security Council, it is by noleans certain that they could be implemented in practice.    Ontho other hand there could be no doubt that any effort we mightnake in this direction would do serious damage to our own economic position.    Accordingly, this course also must be ruledas a means of achieving a settlement of the Rhodesia problem.ijETTLlJiMBNT ON TERMS AUCEPTABLE,^.. THE, RgGIME10,    In present circumstances, the only sort of settlement wecould expect to make with the regime as at present composed isone whi ch invo 1 v ed:(a) immediate legal independence without majority rule;(b) very probably some derogation from the &quot;Tiger&quot;constitutional proposals such as would make possiblethe slowing down of the progress towards majority rule after independence;(c) the holding of a Test of Acceptability while the illegal regime remained, in power;i)   the reduction of the Test of Acceptability to aformality calculated to produce an answer favourable to what was proposed (a fair tost would almost certainly produce a negative answer).pother words, the existing regime would, only settle on termsEich could not be reconciled with our principles.    A settlementSUch as they might agree to would have grave effects on ourlotions with the rest of the Commonwealth and on our positionl!1 ^e United Nations.    We could not even feel any assurance that^ould in fact relieve us of the Rhodesia problem, since thePurity Council might well pass resolutions insisting on the/continuation
itanuation of mandatory sanctions against Rhodesia,    ThisUp also is one which we could not adopt,^Ij^^rgjf/ITH OUR PRESENT POLICIESi    Failing the adoption of any other course, we should hegft with, the necessity to persevere with our present lines ofobey.   Although in the iEimediate future this might prove less^ing than any available alternative, it could hardly be aarcanent policy and we must reckon on its becoming increasinglyifficult to maintain.    It carries with it a considerable riskf finding ourselves eventually forced at the United Nations.nto a &quot;confrontation&quot; with South Africa.    And even short ofhat, it would involve us in a continuous process of irritatingovcrnnents of countries (the U.S.A. , Japan, West Germany etc, )lose friendship we need elsewhere, by nagging at them over theanlementation of a sanctions policy of whose success they areBscoaing increasingly sceptical.   A protracted continuation ofthis process, as the sanctions policy became less credible tother governments, might cause us such embarrassment that wehould eventually have to abandon it and adopt one of the otherHourses outlined above,    Nevertheless, unless and until we decideo adopt some other course, we shall in any case have to pursueI? present policies, and they are not in fact necessarily goingP fail.   There are certainly Europeans in Rhodesia who realise-&quot;-at the country&apos;s development is being blocked by sanctions,  andkit the resulting unemployment among the urban and rural Africans-d present an increasingly serious problem.    And there are somethat suggest that the Rhodesia Front might yet split overSSues such as the declaration of a republic and the &quot;final break&quot;l&apos;-^1 Britain,   These issues are being approached by Mr. Smithlhis cc,Ueagues with groat cauticon:but they might yet findItoo diffeorter8ficult to keep both their moderate and their right-wingatisfied.    The pursuit of our present policiesoerepresented as leading by planned stages tanliablesettlement in the foreseeable future;    but equally itSECRET/is
r215SECRET^possible to say that it offers no prospect at all of bringingloUt a situation in which perhaps with South African support,* composition and attitude of the regime might he changed so3 to make an agreed settlement possible.   Against this must beet the possibility that, particularly if a republic were to beglared, the difficulties in the way of restoring legality woulde increased rather than diminished by the passage of time.2, While following this course we should do what we could toiduce other countries to apply mandatory sanctions with a vigourpi to our own.    But we should not allow ourselves to be pressedextensions of sanctions which would be ineffective whentdged by the impact they would have on Rhodesia.    In order to;elp resist pressure from Commonwealth African Governments andfliers for us to use force (though there is some evidence that commonwealth African leaders are now less inclined to press&apos;or this than before)  or for substantial extensions of sanctions,lit would be important to reassure them that we were not going tojstandon our position on Nibmar or otherwise do a deal with the regime at the Africans&apos; expense.    It would help to reassure them of this if we could make clear that we were not attempting toreach a negotiated settlement with the illegal regime by refusing,for example, to continue the limited contacts which we have hadwth the regime since Lord Alp or t&apos; s visit.    To take this line wouldIi&apos;2 likely to discourage the Governor - perhaps to the point ofKsignation - and to consolidate European opinion in Rhodesia8till more firmly against us, and possibly to weaken resistance inF-odesia to the declaration of a republic.    On the other hand,  it5lght do something to strengthen the effect of sanctions onl^european thinking in Rhodesia by showing that we were really-Mous, and that the regime had not succeeded in making us runaftsr them for a settlement.pjosslbillty OF SECURING SOUTH AFRICAN SUPPORT; &apos;       South African Government have attempted to exert aI mating influence on the regime, in favour of a settlement on&apos;ger lines and against, for example, the declaration of a/republic
republic   But they have never yet been willing to put any strong pressure on the regime although they have available the leverage9ith which to do so, in the extent to which Rhodesia&apos;s ability tosaint a in adequate economic activity in spite of sanctions depends on South African channels of trade.   We do not &quot;believe that, solong as the regime as at present composed holds power in Rhodesia,the South African Government would he prepared to exert the very strong pressure that would be needed to bring then to agree to asettlement which would he fully consistent with our Six Principles(let alone Nihmar).   H.M. Ambassador at Pretoria has commentedthat what the South African Government want to see is a negotiatedcompromise settlement;    that is, one which is acceptable to the rhodesian Europeans as well as to uc, and which consequently wouldnot expose the South African Government to attack from their ownpredominantly pro-Rhodesian supporters for having helped to bring it about.,   This implies something very like immediate independence.H.M. Ambassador has further drawn attention to the possibility that the South Africans and the white Rhodesians will draw closer together;   he points out that the sending of South African police to Rhodesia, and the infiltrations which led to it, has alreadybrought them closer together, and has hardened their attitudesend heightened their emotions.   However, during a conversation between the Foreign Secretary and Dr. Muller in Mew York on22 September,  in the course of which they had discussed what theSouth African reaction would he to an embargo on supplies of oilno Rhodesia through Mozambique, and the intervention of South*tfr-.can Police in Rhodesia, Dr. Muller remarked that both these problems would disappear if there were a satisfactory settlementof Rhodesia.    The British Government had appealed to the SouthAfrican Government to use their influence with the RhodesiansShd Mr. Brown was well aware of the South African Government&apos;sfaction.   The South Africans were as genuinely interested ina solution as the British Government.    Dr. Muller wondered/whether
SEE CUTSET211$ether the time had not come for the British Prime Ministerto tell Mr. Vorster how far the British Government would &quot;beprepared to go.    Mr. Vorstor might then he prepared to take this up with the Rhodesians.    There are indeed considerations which should carry weight with the South Africans in favour oftheir using their influence on behalf of a solution which theywould regard as defensible from their point of view a    The chiefof these is the importance they must attach to having a stable and peaceful country on their northern bolder, and to being free of the political and diplomatic embarrassments resulting for them from the illegality of the regime in Rhodesia.    The continuanceof white domination in Rhodesia is not a prime South Africaninterest, provided that it does not come to an end so quickly,or in such circumstances, that the country1 s stability isendangered,   A further point of some importance to South Africawould be that, even though so far experience of the applicationof sanctions to Rhodesia has not &quot;been such as to encourage thosewho would apply then also against South Africa&apos;s apartheid policy the sooner the use of sanctions in Southern Africa came to anend the better for the South Africans.APPROACHES THAT MIGHT BJS DISCUSS1P WITH THB......SOUTH . A.FRICANSa)     Postponement of Independence14.    In a memorandum of which a copy is attached at Annex,Mr, Malcolm MacDonald has suggested that a settlement to whichthe South Africans night be prepared to give their support wouldtake the follov/ing general shape:(i)    no independence before majority rule;(ii)    no majority rule for at least ten to fifteen years (the minimum period in which it could havebeen expected to come about on the &quot;Tiger&quot; basis);(iii)   provisions to ensure that after the attainment of majority rule the white minority had a just share in the country rs government,/During
.puring the period of progress towards majority rule a greateffort would have to &quot;be devoted to the acceleration of Africaneducational and social advancement,  in which Britain and other friendly countries would need to take part.    There would also have to &quot;oe some guarantee that progress towards majority ruledid in fact take place, and this might involve - at least fora period - a British mxlitary force stationed in Rhodesia toensure against a second 1.0.1. and possibly some limited formof effective British control in certain fields of policy;   e.g.education and social development (there has of course never&quot;been such control in Rhodesia before;.15.    Such a settlement would disappoint the African nationalistsin Rhodesia, who are and would remain insistent on a promptmovement to majority rule and independence;    but it should bepossible to win positive support for it from commonwealth governments in Africa and to get them to exert their influence on the Africans in Rhodesia and to persuade them to use onlyconstitutional methods;    and perhaps also to .put a stop to the entry of guerrillas from further north.    Such support fromAfrican Governments might help to convince the South Africans ofthe advantages that would accrue from such a settlement, and provide an incentive to use their influence in its favour.    On&quot;the other hand, the Europeans in Rhodesia would be strongly opposed to such a settlement, and it cannot be expected thatto1. Sm?&quot;th would accept responsibility for it unless RhodesiaT&apos;ere in a really difficult position as a result of continued andintensified sanctions, and this were the only way in which hecould hope to continue as &quot;Prime Minister&quot;;    even then he wouldProbably refuse.ACA settlement on the lines just described, if it could besecured, is probably the only one that could be fully reconciledwith our principles and with our Nibmar declaration.    But, apartx CIr&apos; the difficulty of securing it, such a settlement would/itself
itself present, us with some significant problems,,    In particular,it would mean the continuation of our direct responsibility injjhodcsia for the full period of progress to majority rule.    If weaaintained an effective political and military &quot;presence&quot; therein order to guarantee that the settlement was actually carriedjutj we should, be involved in considerable expense and potentialdifficulty, and we should certainly be under constant pressureat the United Nations and from local African nationalists to accelerate progress to majority rule beyond what was safe.   Weshould not escape such international embarrassments if we left the implementation of the settlement to the Rhodesians themselvesindeed, we should then have to face ten to fifteen years ofresponsibility for Rhodesia in the United Nations and elsewhererithout decisive pov/er to affect the course of affairs in thatcountry.   In either case, It would be open to doubt whether solong a preparatory period before majority rule as the ten to fifteen years aimed at would be adhered to in practice, and certainly the South Africans would be likely to fear that thepreparatory period would not be so long as this.17.   But whatever the merits or demerits of such a solution,;H.M. Ambassador at Pretoria has expressed the view that theSouth African Government would not be prepared to put pressurewthe Rhodesians to accept a solution on these lines, althoughtaey would acquiesce if the Rhodesians were to accept it.   WeRelieve he is right.l0* another possible solution for which we might seek activeSouth African support would be the proposed &quot;Tiger&quot; settlement,conplete and unamended, and including the provisions in the^ger Working Document for the return to legality, a broad-based^erim Government etc.    This seems to be the furthest that we.Could ourselves go towards the regime&apos;s position;    indeed it; ,oul&amp; present us with the two major difficulties of our Nibmar/declaration
declaration and the probability that a reliable test of[acceptability might well show that the suggested settlementjas not in fact acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole.lion the point of view of the South Africans, an attempt to makethe regime accept this settlement would presumably be lessdifficult than an attempt to make them accept one based on Nibmar.Ihe right-wingers of the Rhodesia Front, inside and outside theCabinet, would no doubt be strongly opposed to it, but givenactive South African support and with the assistance of theGovernor it might be possible for Mr. Smith to free himself from them, particularly if he came to believe that they might otherwisedecide to discard him.    Experience of Mr.  smith s character doesnot encourage us to believe that he would &quot;be prepared to act inthis way.   Even if he were ready and able to do this he would still have to face the possibility that the test of acceptabilityslight produce an unfavourable result, leaving him with a choice between the loss of independence and a second illegal declarationof independence in circumstances in which the right-wingers would regard him as having become a traitor to Rhodesia.   He might therefore argue in reply to any South African pressure for his agreement to a solution of this kind that he could only agreeif he had an assurance that the test of acceptability would betald in such a way as to put a favourable answer beyond reasonabledoubt.   This would obviously present us with a grave difficulty.0)     Independence but with some continuing Britishrjjsjgpns ibility5*   Yet another approach which has been suggested as beingdifficult for Rhodesia to reject and offering a real prospect ofStaining South African support is one which would involve the^cognition more or less at once of Rhodesian independence andfiance on constitutional guarantees and entrenched provisions,possibly coupled with arrangements which would leave with usf56 resPonsibility for ensuring that the guarantees andbenched provisions were observed.    It is not easy to see how/ this
could be provided for, but in any case this approach has[tleast as many dangerous as helpful points.   By retaining som..;Ipee of responsibility we might be able to claim that we haddeparted from our Nibmar pledge.    But if the arrangements-,ye us any means to carry out the responsibilities we should begaining, there would be no real independence for Rhodesia so;lat Mr, Smith would reject the whole idea and the South Africansrould be unwilling to put pressure on him in its favour.    On theier hand, to retain responsibility without having the means tolltfluence events would merely perpetuate our present emb arras sm enConsiderations afjjej^in^TijQihagId,   Thus, none of the suggested courses based on securingjffective South African support would be at all easy to achieve .&quot;orwholly satisfactory even if achieved at all.    There are al-^oiifficult problems over timing if we decided to seek any solutionpthese lines.    Any pressure exerted by the South Africans orke regime towards a settlement would have more chance of sue..?:-..Ji&quot;, after the experience of a further period of sanctions ana Lacfter disadvantages of international non-recognition, there had--en a change in the composition and attitude of the regime.   Butsen apart from the danger that other governments might not^severe long enough with a sufficiently strict application of actions, there is the possibility - referred to in paragraph Lwe- that, while we were waiting for sanctions to produce the?esired effect, the regime would declare a republic.    Even though&apos;,^declaration was legally Invalid, it would make the return toijlity even more ciiffiCUit to bring about, both because of theseater reluctance of the regime to retrace their steps after!&amp;ing what they would have regarded and represented as a finalwith Britain,  and because of the probability that the.vernor (and possibly some at least of the judges) would haveUP the struggle on behalf of constitutional rule.    OneSequence would be to discourage the South Africans from/attempting
^tempting to help,,    Our own policies would probably have an effect on the regime&apos;s decision whether or not to declare are public.   By keeping the way open to negotiations for an agreed settlement we might strengthen the position of those in the regime;;fio wished to delay such a declaration.    But at the same time wesight be weakening the psychological impact of sanctions onRhodesians, while also making the African Governments moresuspicious of our true intentions.mVBSTING OURSELVES OF OUR SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES21,    Unlike the courses examined above, the object of thiscourse would not be a definite solution of the Rhodesia problem,tut the reduction of our responsibility for it to a level atwhich it was no greater than that of any other member of theUnited Nations, except insofar as we are a permanent member ofthe Security Council.    To divest ourselves completely of anyparticular responsibility for Rhodesia we should need to abandonor to transfer to someone else our sovereignty over the territory.This would require an Act of Parliament;    and would, incidentally,create difficult citizenship problems,.22.    This course is feasible, though there arc serious difficulties about it which are described below.    Howeverskilfully executed, it would almost certainly be regarded as aaajcr diplomatic defeat and, unlike other steps in decolonisationm modern times, would be a confession of failure.    (Palestinels not a parallel, since in that case there was already a LeagueQf Nations mandate).If it were decided that, notwithstanding these difficulties,&apos;&apos;e should attempt to divest ourselves of responsibility for-hodesia, we should want to transfer this responsibility to thetoited Nations rather than leave both sovereignty and responsibilityU were dangling in mid-air.   The best way of achieving thisould be to try to promote a situation in which the United Nations^dually accustomed themselves to the doctrine that they, and/not
jot we, must ultimately be responsible for solving the Rhodesiaproblem.   This would be extremely difficult.    The United Nationslav! consistently taken the line that the Rhodesian problem is primarily the responsibility of the administering power.    TheSecretary General referred to this specifically in his annual report published last month.    Even on sanctions U Thant takes the view that the major responsibility rests v/ith the UnitedKingdom.   If we were to transfer responsibility for Rhodesiadirectly to the United Nations, we should have to take allpossible steps to change the present views of the secretary general and indeed of many members of the United Nations.    Weshould also have to think very carefully how best to persuade the United Nations to agree that Rhodesia should become a trust territory and what would be the constitutional implicationsinvolved.   Alternative but even less attractive ways of achieving the same object would be a simple unilateral abandonment of sovereignty or a transfer of sovereignty to a rhodesian government in exile.2t[.    Unilateral abandonment of sovereignty might be held to confirm the claim of the illegal regime to recognition by other states, since our action would mean that, by implication, theSmith regime was admitted to bo the effective authority in rhodesia which, under our5 own doctrine of recognition, ought then to be recognised generally as the Government of Rhodesia.   a transfer of sovereignty to a Government in exile, assuming thatwe could be formed, would be a step which would appear to lack&quot;^ality and would be inconsistent with our normal criteria for^cognition.   While there might be some endorsement of this step,*t vould be more widely criticised as a device to enable us to escape from our embarrassments.An attempt gradually to transfer responsibility to theJnited Nations would undoubtedly be criticised strongly by other^ftbers before it had any chance of success.    It would be a/reversal
reversal of our insistence hitherto that Rhodesia is a british responsibility and would he likely to provoke deep suspicions,fe could withstand these.    But if it succeeded, we should helikely to find ourselves faced with pressure in the united nations for courses of action,  either against Rhodesia or againstSouth Africa, which we could not take hut which it might in logicad politically he embarrassing to oppose.   We could notify theUnited Nations that if certain courses, unacceptable to us, were proposed, we could not take part in them.   But sooner or laterre might well be faced v/ith a choice of vetoing or &quot;going along with&quot; (by abstaining or voting in favour) a Security council resolution prescribing unacceptable action.
SELECTIONS ON RH0pE8I.AI have the temerity to suggest for consideration apossible (but perhaps unattainable by negotiation with Smith)solution to the Rhodesian problem.   It is a result of myconsideration of this baffling question in the light of discussions I have held during the last several months with various authorities - African and otherwise - in West, East,Central and Southern Africa, excluding Rhodesia itself.2,    Before mentioning its main features (in paragraph 10below) I should comment on certain relevant matters.   In mySavingram No, 21 sent from Rome on 29 June I wrote aboutNIBMR, saying that there is no chance of the African governments in the Commonwealth (or a majority of other commonwealth governments for that matter) being persuaded in any circum-stancee to agree to a change in H.M.G. &apos; s undertakings given at the last Commonwealth Conference that if the Smith regime in Rhodesia rejected the final offer then about to be made toit, the British Government would withdraw all previous proposalsfor a constitutional settlement, and &quot;in particular would notthereafter be prepared to submit to the British Parliamentany settlement which involves Independence before majority rule&quot;.   This is a fact which we cannot Ignore,3.   Perhaps I might make some further observations on it,In my judgment the significance of H.M.G.&apos; s declaration ofNIBMR has been exaggerated out of all proportion to its real importance by some newspaper and other commentaries in Britainand Rhode8laB   For example, it is often suggested that whenH*M.G. made their announcement of NIBMR this was something new -a radical change in the Government&apos; s policy.   It was of coursenothing of the kind.   It merely stated specifically what had/been virtually
been virtually - though not absolutely - implied in the oft-repeated statements by &quot;both the present labour and the previousconservative governments that any solution to the rhodesianproblem must &quot;be consistent with the five (later six)principles, including the fifth.   this fifth principle laidjown that any settlement must he acceptable to the people ofhhodesia as a whole.   of course this matter could not beprejudged; if the fifth principle as such were still applicable,i decision as to what type of constitution would be acceptable to those people as a whole would have to be left to a royalcommission - or some other appropriate means of making a fair and free test of their opinion - to judge in the circumstancesof the time.   it is possible that such a test would show thatthe people were ready to accept a constitution granting .independence before majority rule - but that always has been,find still remains, unlikely in the extreme.   lord alportf 8rocont investigation of the situation in rhodesia showed thatthis is certainly the position today.   as mr. bowden told theprasonwoalth high commissioners at a meeting of the commonwealthsanctions committee in july, alport reported after his returnto london that whereas the europeans in rhodesia were &quot;over-jtolningly&quot; behind smith in rejecting nibmr, &quot;a large majorityof tho africans, supported by the minority non-european communities, held tho principle of nibmr to bo unassailable&quot;.that is true now with slthole, nkomo and other nationalistnaders still lockod-up, with no freedom of the press in^odosia, and with no active political campaigning permittedthcro* we must presume that this opinion would bo greatlylengthened with those conditions all reversed during a fairfree test.   it seems clear that smith himself is fearfulthis; for if he were as confident as he declares himself to/be that the
SECRETbe that the Rhodesian people as a whole really approve of independence being seized by or granted to a white minorityappointment of an impartial Royal Commission to investigate the matter.i,,   Therefore H.M.G.1 s declaration of NIBMR almost certainlystated categorically what it had consistently announced ineffect in the Fifth Principle,   Moreover, if we were now toabandon NIBMR as such, and to return to the Fifth Principle,the change could be prevaricatory, and add to our difficultiesrather than reducing them in Rhodesia.   The modification ofour undertaking to the Commonwealth Conference on this pointnight lead Smith and his rebel colleagues to assume that.m.g. would be ready to accept the findings of some unfairand unfree test of the opinion of the people of Rhodesia asa whole - such as the judgment of the collective Africanchiefs who are in the pay of the illegal regime^   Smith andco might therefore suppose that if they could re-negotiate with ub a constitution of the &quot;Tiger&quot; type granting Independencebefore majority rule, they could count on H.M.G. submittingthis to Parliament,   And if a truly fair and free testafterwards showed that a majority of Rhodesians were opposedto that Constitution, and H.M.G. therefore refused to recommendtt to Parliament, they would say we had acted disonestly*ith them - and the last state in Rhodesia wo\ild be worse than the first.)   Another misconception about NIBMR seems to be commonin the press and some other quarters.   It is often suggestedwat NIBMR is the major obstacle to an early agreement withsfflith and his regime.   This is not the case.   The manner oft!ieir rejection of the comprehensive &quot;Tiger&quot; proposals^onstrated that - if NIBMR as ouch were to be abandoned -government, he would welcome instead of opposing the/the whole
whole procedure for a return to legal government inosia is at least as great an obstacle to a settlement with. and this has been confirmed by Alport&apos;a study of thetuation and by the more recent exchanges of messages withHh. The members of the illegal regime are opposed to -(a) giving up their powers to a legal broad basedrepresentative Government with whom H.M,G. would thennegotiate a possible constitution!(b) the appointment of a Royal Commission (or any alternativearrangement) to make a proper teat of Rhodesian opinion asa whole on ^iatever constitution might be negotiated withthat Government!(a) the release of political detaineesp the ending of censorship of the press, and the establishment of freeconstitutional political discussion and campaigning beforethe Royal Commission starts its work,bably there are other major obstacles to a settlement asroll, such as the substance of the amendments which 8mith toldAlport that he and his colleagues wish to see made in the&quot;Tiger&quot; constitution.   NIBMR is therefore far from being theonly obstacle to agreement with Smith and Qo in their presentlood,It some times even seems to be suggested in public commentNIBMR is in any case a wrong policy.   Again, this of course to not correct,   I stated in paragraph 3 of my Savingram No, 21too two important consider at ions - one of principle and theother of practice - which make the African Governments in the^miaonwealth (and no doubt most of the other Commonwealth^rnments too) foel strongly that NIBMR is right: and if weare honestly realistic we cannot disagree with them.   First,ever  8lnce the white minority government in South Africa was/granted
9 9 0wwwgranted Independence more than fifty years ago, with manyunfortunate consequences,, it has &quot;been a fundamental principleof the Commonwealth that Independence should &quot;be granted only topreviously dependent countries where the Government command the support of a majority of the population.   Second, thepractical results of that grant of Independence to a minoritygovernment in South Africa - such as the promulgation of thepolicy of &quot;apartheid&quot; and related acts - have destroyed any prospect of the African members of the Commonwealth consentingto Independence being yielded to a similar minority racialistadministration in Rhodesia.   It is unbelievable that anyguarantees of &quot;uninterrupted progress to majority rule&quot; whichmight be written into a Constitution granting Independence inthe meantime to such a minority government in Rhodesia wouldbe respected; those guarantees would probably not be worth the pnpor they were inscribed on in the hands of suchobviously untrustworthy men as Ian Smith and many of his associates.   The result of any such deal would therefore bethat we abandoned the 4^000,000 black Africans in Rhodesia to asimilar fate to that which has befallen their fellows in SouthAfrica.7.    It is unthinkable that the Independent African governments in the Commonwealth would ever agree to what they would regard as a gross betrayal of their fellow Africans in Rhodesia.   Ifwe were to raise any such possibility in a commonwealth conference they would therefore feel compelled to oppose it -and we would lose the support of our good friends among themlike Kenyatta and half-a-dozen others as well as of our bittercritics like KaundaB   Moreover, the force of their ca^e on this issue would undoubtedly gain them the support of a greatmajority of the other members of the Commonwealth, includingnot only the Asian and Caribbean but also the Canadian/representatives.
representatives.   If we then ignored the opinions of thatmajority, and prooeoded to abandon NIBMR not only in breach ofour undertaking given at the last Commonwealth Conference butalso in defianoo of our partners&apos; freshly expressed views, thisoould deal a mortal blow to the Commonwealth,8.   I wrote in my &quot;Supplementary Note on NIBMR&quot; of 15 July(not circulated to all) that although there is no chance of getting our African partners in the Commonwealth to agree toan abandonment of NIBMR, it is not impossible that, if in ayear or two&apos;s time our polioy of eoonomio sanctions weredemonstrably not working sufficiently effectively to gain usan outright victory against the rebels, they might then betoady to aoQuiesce in such an abandonment - provided they were satisfied with our interpretation of the Fifth Principle,On further reflection I do not think this thought is worthrar suing.   The discussion of any suggestion on our part thatNIBMR should be put aside would cause such bitter, suspiciousargument that it would not be worth suffering unless we wereto gain some substantial advantage in return.   No possibilityof that would exist.   Presumably our proposal would be that the fifth Principle should again be substituted for NIBMR; but, asI have pointed out above, there ia in fact almost certainly no difference between the practical results of the one and theother.   Moreover, to satisfy themselves that any acquiescencethem in the casting aside of NIBMR would be justified, the-^rionn members (no doubt supported by several others) wouldB(^k to insist of guarantees about the method to be employed for the implementation of the Fifth Principle which would*sure that no difference existed between the two.I therefore think it would be a mistake to ask a Common-*6&amp;Uh Conference to reconsider this issue of NIBMR./10,
U, Then - If we should not contemplate modifying NIB24R, andU it is one of the present obstacles to agreement with theSmith regime - is an honourable solution to the Rhodesianoroblem impossible of achievement?   I suggest that it is not,and that at a later stage we might be able to secure a settlementbased on the following major elements(i) no Independence before majority rule?(ii) no majority rule before another ten or fifteen years;but a gradual, peaceful progress towards it throughoutthat period(iii) proper: constitutional provisions to ensure that afterthe attainment of majority rule the white minority in rhodesia has a just share in the country&apos;s government.i understand from Mr. Bowden^ public statements on the subjectthat the provisions of the &quot;Tiger&apos;&apos; constitution would have brought majority rule in 10 or 15 years.   In that oase, if, this constitution were amended so that Independence came after thecompletion of the process instead of before it, the requirements in (i) and (ii) above could thereby be satisfied,11. I believe such a settlement would be acceptable to:-(a) the British Government9 Parliament and people;(b) all the African Governments in the Commonwealth (andtherefore also to the other Governments in the commonwealth and to an overwhelming majority of the members of theUnited Nations) j(c) the Government of the Republic of South Africa (and soto the Portuguese authorities responsible for theadministration of Mozambique and Angola)..The or&amp;y question - and of course, a big and important question -i8 whether it could be made acceptable to the people of Rhodesia,; oth the whites and the blacks.   If we persist firmly in ourPoHcy of enforcing the maximum practicable economic sanctions/(short of
(short of escalation against South Africa) and every othertreasure against the rebel regime, this may not he impossible -jrovided we ean gain discreet assistance from the GovernmentIn South Afrisa and of the African Governments in the Gommon-,ealth in &quot;selling it&quot; to the white minority and the Africanisjority there respectively.12, If we stand by NIBMR without qualification, I feel fairlyconfident that at least a substantial majority of the AfricanGovernmentb in the Commonwealth would agree to a settlement onthe lines suggested in paragraph 10 above,   I think that suchleaders as Kenyatta, Ofcote, Ankrah, Jawara, Bands, Seretse Khamaand Jonathan would now accept that a transition period of 10 or perhaps even 15 years before majority rule would be reasonable;and I feel that this could be made agreeable to Nyerere.   Inthat oase Juxon-Smith and whoever is the Nigerian leader would presumably agree.   Kaunda might wish for a shorter period of transition; but he would probably fall in with the views of sucha large majority of his African colleagues.   Of course, these*African leaders could not expose themselves to the criticismIthey would face if they consented to a settlement which statedin specific public terms that majority rule would not be attainedin Rhodesia for 10 or 15 years; but for other reasons it will inany oaBe be better to avoid giving figures.   A formula could bewed to the effect that the new Constitution provided for a steady, uninterrupted advance to majority rule - and our .Commonwealth African partners would know (and agree) privatelythat the constitutional provisions meant that in practice atransition period of 10 or 15 years would ensue.I expect that the same solution would be acceptable on itsBerlts to Mr. Vorster and his colleagues In the South african government.   It seems that they privately accept that majority/rule is
rule la inevitable in Rhodesia at some time in the not veryremote future.   That being so, they are concerned to ensure ifBBible two things; first, that the period of transition islong as is practicablei and second, - and very important tothen - that during the interim period law and order prevailIn Rhodesia,,   As regards the first, probably they would regardperiod of 10 to 15 years as reasonably satisfactory in the face of present-day political circumstances.   As regards thesecond, they might well welcome (and be ready to make concessionsfor) a settlement which carried the agreement of the african governments in the Commonwealth, because they would then hopethat there was a good chance of those Governments&apos; influencebeing used to persuade the African Nationalists in Rhodesiato conduct themselves peacefully and constitutionally throughoutthe transition years.   They must greatly fe/ir that if (on theother hand) our Rhodesian settlement is unacceptable to thoseAfrican Governments, many of them and their colleagues else wherein Africa, aided by the Communist powers, will do everythingthey can to stir up violence in Rhodesia - next door to theSepublic.   This must be a consideration of major, and perhapsdecisive, importance to the South Africans, since they need a peaceful &quot;buffer&quot; state between them and the Independent african countries further north during the next several vital years&quot;hilat thoy are trying to develop a workable policy ofreasonably neighbourly relations with those countries,,^ It would be of the greatest help If we could secure awodeeian settlement which is acceptable both to the IndependentHack African Governments north of Rhodesia and to the whiteMh African Government further south, because they might then!ivo us real  assistance in securing a favourable answer to10 important question: can this solution be made acceptable0 the Rhodesians themselves, both blacks and whites?   As regards/the fourSECRET i
jjj four million Africans, I expect that initially theationalists among them would demur at such a long period of trans-ijion to majority rule as 10 or 15 years.   Nevertheless, if thetfrioan Governments in the Commonwealth regarded this as a^enable proposal, they would exert their collective influencejo persuade those Nationalists to agree? and I believe theytottld suooeefi.   Most of them.in any case feel critical of thejationalists because of the present split in their movement between ZANU and ZAPU, and because of their refusal throughoutthe last several years to employ constitutional methods ofpolitical progress under the 1961 Constitution.   Other recentwonts elsewhere in Africa have made many of them inolined intheir hearts to be more realistic and less emotional than hassometimes been the case; and if we will take them into our confidence, and discuss the problem frankly with them asCommonwealth partners, I think we oould get them into a moodto assert their views on those Rhode elan Nationalists.15. Then what about the Europeans in Rhodesia?   That is a moredifficult situation.   They are politically tough people who haveblared illegal independence, and who have a very strongMrs not to be forced to abandon it0   Moreover, theirobstinate attitude has naturally been further strengthened by to grim, unhappy events which they know are happening in some independent countries already under African majority rule - andtoy remain deliberately blind to the more encouragingtovoiopments in other ouch countries.   Nevertheless, if we^sue economic sanctions and other pressures to a point wherelife becomes very uncomfortable indeed for them, a significantNrtion of them may be ready to change their minds.   And ifVorster and his Government were then disposed to use theirluonce eoorotly with them in favour of the solution suggestedParagraph 10 above, this could be of decisive help.   Such a/settlement       I
