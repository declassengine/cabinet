JMENTIS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)At their meeting held on 26th September the Home AffairsCommittee invited me to bring before the Cabinet the proposals whichIliad submitted to the Committee for reforming the divorce law.     Mycolleagues will remember that last summer a Group set up by the archbishop of Canterbury under the chairmanship of the Bishop ofExeter published, under the title of &quot;Putting Asunder&quot;, a reportcontaining detailed proposals for the reform of this branch of thelaw.    The essence of these proposals was to substitute for the currentrule, whereby (with one exception) a decree of divorce can be obtainedonly on the proof of a &quot;matrimonial offence&quot;, a rule whereby the soleground for divorce would be &quot;breakdown of marriage&quot;.    At my request,the Law Commission examined &quot;Putting Asunder&quot; and submitted to me areport on the proposals made by the Archbishop&apos;s Group;  that report,entitled &quot;The Field of Choice&quot;, was published last autumn (Cmnd. 3123)and both reports figured largely in a subsequent debate in the House ofLords on 23rd November, 1966.    Since then the subject has also beenconsidered by the Scottish Law Commission, whose recommendations are set out in &quot;The Grounds Considered&quot; (Cmnd. 3256).2.      When &quot;The Field of Choice&quot; was published it was immediatelyapparent that there were considerable differences between the viewsof the Archbishop&apos;s Group and those of the Law Commission, butsubsequent consultations between the two bodies have led to thosedifferences being resolved.    I am now satisfied (as is the Lav/Commission) that it would be fea.sible to put into legislative formproposals which would be acceptable in xirinciple to the Archbishop^Group and v?hich would be workable in practice.     These are, in substance, the proposals which (in a purely personal capacity)I recommended in a speech last summer which attracted someattention.    They do not differ in essentials (though they do inform) from the recommendations made for Scotland in &quot;The GroundsConsidered&quot;.    I must emphasise that, although the Archbishop^ group is satisfied with what I am now proposing, the Church as a whole hasnot been consulted and is not committed;  nor has the Archbishop of canterbury expressed personal support.3.      The essence of the matter is that, while adhering to their viewthat the sole ground of divorce should be &quot;breakdown of marriage&quot;, the archbishop^ Group have accepted the need to retain the &quot;undefendeddivorce&quot; in which the petitioner can obtain a decree speedily andwithout any probing into the history or prospects of the marriage.COPY NO.5th October, 1967CABINETDIVORCE LAW reform memorandum by the Lord Chancellor-1-
This concession on their part meets the fundamental criticism of&quot;Putting Asunder&quot; made by the Law Commission in &quot;The Field of choice&quot;, which is generally considered to be well-founded.    Whatis therefore now proposed is that the court should grant a decreeonly if satisfied that the marriage had irretrievably broken down.No marriage should be treated as having broken down irretrievablyunless the court was satisfied that -(i) the respondent had committed adultery and the petitioner found it intolerable to continue or resume cohabitation;  or(ii)  the conduct of the respondent had been so intolerable that thepetitioner could not reasonably be expected to continue orresume cohabitation;   or(iii) the parties had ceased to cohabit for a continuous period ofat least tv/o years and the resj^ondent either -(a) had deserted the petitioner, or(b) did not object to the grant of a divorce;  or(iv) the parties had ceased to cohabit for a continuous period ofnot less than five years0There should be a procedure to. ensure that a respondents decision not to object to the grant of a divorce had been taken freely and witha full appreciation of the consequencesc4,       The court should be required to refuse a divorce if satisfiedthat, having rega.rd to the conduct and interests of the parties and theinterests of the children and ether persons affected, it would be wrong to dissolve the marriage notwithstanding the public interest indissolving marriages which have irretrievably broken down.The court would also be required to refuse a divorce until satisfiedthat the arrangements made for the care, upbringing and support ofthe children were satisfactory or the best that could be devised in thecircumstances;  and that, where the respondent had applied for financial relief, equitable financial arrangements (or the best that could be devised in the circumstances) had been made for the respondentor that no such arrangements should be made,     The c court would havepower to refuse a divorce if the petitioner had attempted to deceive thecourt.5.      In accordance with the present law, it is proposed that nopetition for divorce should be presented without leave of the courtwithin three years from the date of the marriage0    In every casethe solicitor acting for a petitioner should be required to certifywhether or not he had discussed the possibility of reconciliationand had brought to the petitioner^ attention the names of appropriatepersons and marriage guidance organisations qualified to assist ineffecting a reconciliation.    If the court at any stage had reason tobelieve that reconciliation might be effected, it should have power to adjourn for not more than three months to enable this possibility tobe explored.CO:N EVIDENTIAL
6o      There is little difference of substance between what is hereproposed for England and Wales and what the Scottish Law commission have proposed for Scotland, though the form of the proposals is different,,The only distinctions of any importance are that it is not proposed thatScotland should adopt the rule (which has never applied in Scotland) thatin general there should be no divorce within three years of marriagejthat the Scottish Law Commission does not propose that the court shouldbe under a general duty to refuse a decree if satisfied that in all thecircumstances it would be wrong to dissolve the marriage;  and that itis not proposed that there should be any provision in Scotland for a compulsory reconciliation procedure,,7,      The measure of agreement which has now been reached between all those who have given careful consideration to problems which have for many years seemed intractable is most encouraging,     I have nodoubt that there is today a wide measure of support for these proposals,although a number of my colleagues on the home Affairs Committee areof the opinion that they are likely to prove controversial in some quarters,I believe that the time has come when we should take a positive stepforv/ard by having a Bill drafted by Parliamentary Counsel which wouldgive effect to the proposals I have described.8.      The Committee did not think it would be appropriate to embodythese proposals in a Government Bill, but were of the opinion that,subject to the approval of the Cabinet, I should take steps to have aBill drafted by Parliamentary Counsel for introduction by a private member, it being clearly understood that the Government would remainstrictly neutral and that there would be a free vote for both Liinistersand backbenchers.     The Committee were of the opinion that any questionof making Government time available for such a Bill could better beconsidered after Second Reading when we should know what measureof support in Parliament it was likely to attract.    Accordingly, if mycolleages approve, I propose to invite Parliamentary Counsel attachedto the Lav/ Commission to draft a Bill embodying the proposals outlined in this paper.    Although the Lav/ Commission is already engaged in examining the whole question of financial relief in matrimonial causes,I do not think that this need in any v/ay involve holding up the Bill:financial relief raises difficult technical questions and the inclusionof the necessary comprehensive provisions could well make the Billtoo complex for a Private Member to handle.    In my view, it wouldbe sufficient if (as I have suggested above) provision were made empowering the court to refuse a decree unless satisfied that appropriate provisionhad been made for the respondent.9.      The Home Affairs Committee also considered the question of including in the Bill provisions relating to Scotland.    &quot;While it is obviously desirable to keep the divorce laws of both countries instep, inclusion of Scottish provisions might make the Bill too difficult for a Private Member and, in any event, the existing legal differences between the two countries may lead to the conclusion that separate legislation would anyhow be preferable.     The Home Affairs Committee&apos;conclusion was that we need not come to any final decision at this stage,but that v/e should, in the first place, put in hand the drafting of Englishlegislation and that in due course I should consult with the Secretary ofState and the Lord Advocate about the question of including comparableScottish provisions.    Subject to the views of my colleagues, I agree thatwe should adopt this course.
10o      I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that -(a) I may be authorised to arrange for Pa.rliamenta.ry Counsel attachedto the Law Commission to draft a Bill embodying the proposals set out above, to be handed to a Private Member,(b) The Governments attitude should be one of neutrality and thequestion of making Government time available for the Bill should beconsidered in the light of the degree of support shown for it on SecondReading.(c) The question of including in the Bill provisions relating to scotland should in due course be further considered in consultation between Scottish Ministers and myself.Lord Chancellor^ Office, S.W.L.5th October, 1967
