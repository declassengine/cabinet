(JMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)G bC[67) 164 COPY NO.23rd October, 1967CABINETAGE OF MAJORITYMemorandum by the -Lord chancellor at their meeting on 13fch October the Home Affairs committee invited me to submit to the Cabinet my proposals for implementing theReport of the Committee on the A.ge of Majority which was published last july (Cmnd. 3342) and which has attracted a good deal of attention.    TheLatey Committee, with my full approval, gave a wide interpretation toits terms of reference and dealt in its Report with most of the branchesof the law by which special provision is made in regard to persons under21j apart from the provisions of the criminal law and the voting age.which, strictly, is a matter for the Speaker5^ Conference.    With the voting age is linked the lower age for liability to jury service, which theHome Affairs Committee agreed in 1965 should be reviewed if a change is made in the voting age.2.      On the major question, whether the age of full legal capacityshould be reduced below 21. the Latey Committee was divided.    Themajority of nine, which included the Chairman, Mr. Justice Latey,recommended a reduction to 18 for all purposes other than those mentioned above.    Two members of the Committee, however, thoughtthat the age of majority should remain at 21 and that parental or courtconsent to marriage and the wardship jurisdiction of the ChanceryDivision should continue until that age, and that persons under 21 shouldbe able to claim relief from harsh or oppressive contracts to which theyhad become parties.    As regards the changes proposed in. relation to persons under the age of IS the Committee was unanimous.3.      The reasons of the majority of the Committee for recommending a reduction in the age of full legal responsibility to 18 rested on their belief that most young people today mature earlier than in the past andthat by 18 most of them are ready to assume full responsibilities andwould profit by doing so and that this would in its turn benefit thecommunity as a whole.    The views of the majority on this aspect of theenquiry are fully set out in Part I of the Report, which I hope mycolleagues will agree is very readable.    Although the minority of theLatey Committee disagreed with the majority on the general question ofthe age of full responsibility, they nevertheless agreed with them in thinking that young people over 18 should be able to acquire a legal estate in land and make wills disposing of their property.    For all-1-
practical purposes, therefore, the minority view was confined to feeneed for a person between the ages of 18 and 21 to obtain parental orcourt consent to marriage and the continuance of the wardshipjurisdiction until 21, notwithstanding that the judges of the ChanceryDivision were unanimous in thinking that the age for this purpose shouldbe reduced to 18,4,     The majority recommendation in favour of reducing the age of full responsibility to 18 has received a wide measure of support in thePress and elsewhere and the Home Affairs Committee was in favour of accepting it.    My colleagues thought, however, that the Cabinet shouldhave an opportunity of considering the matter, not only because of its general social importance but because of the repercussions whichacceptance of the majority recommendation may have on the age for theParliamentary franchise.    I understand that this is a matter on whichthe Speaker!s Conference is likely to report within a few months.    TheGovernment will be pressed to announce their views on the Lateyrecommendations when the Report is debated in Parliament inNovember (notice has already been given of a motion in the House ofLords) but I do not think that acceptance of the majority recommendationneed embarrass us in regard to the voting age, although it may wellstrengthen our hand if v/e decide to reduce the age for that purpose to 18.5,     As I have said, the Latey Committee^ recommendations asregards persons below the age of legal majority were unanimous^    Inthe important field of infants5 contracts, the Committee thought that thepresent state of the law was plainly unsatisfactory and ought to be reviewed by the Law Coramission,    For this purpose the committee made a number of proposals for changes in the law which they thoughtthat the Law Commission might usefully be invited to consider, and thisis something which I should propose to invite the Commission to do assoon ae an opportunity arises,6.      The Latey Committee made a number of recommendations aboutthe powers of the High Court and the magistrates&apos; courts when dealingwith wardship and children^ cases,    (There is a summary of recommendations at page 126 of the Report,)    They thought that, pendinganymore radical reorganisation of die family jurisdiction of the HighCourt, the Divorce Division should be given concurrent jurisdiction withthe Chancery Division in wardship and adoption cases and those underthe Guardianship of Infants Acts.    I should like to see this recommendationimplemented as soon as possible, as well as recommendations (18) and(22), which concern the further powers which the High Court ought to have in wardship and similar proceedings.    But I do not think it would be appropriate to deal at present with the recommendations ( (19), (20),(21), (24) and (25) ) for giving wider pov/ers to the magistrates&apos; courts.So far as maintenance orders are concerned, these are matters whichare already being considered by the Law Commission as part of the irreview of the law relating to financial relief in matrimonial proceedings,on which I hope it will be possible to legislate in the 1968-69 Session.Recommendation (21), about extending the powers of magistrates to makesupervision orders, is a matter which would probably be better dealtwith in the Childi .-enIs Bill which I understand the Home Secretary ishoping to introduce in the same Session,
&quot;u      The Committee did not deal with, the age (at present 21) above which it is not possible for a person to be adopted^ but if the age of majority is to be reduced to 18 it would be anomalous not to make acorresponding change in the Adoption Acts 1958 so far as England andWales are concerned,    The Home Secretary agrees with this, but theSecretary of State for Scotland has not yet decided whether or not asimilar change should be made for Scotland^ to which the Adoption Actapplies at present but with which, the Latey Committee was not concerned,,8,      The Latey Report also contains some recommendations about boyentrants into the Armed Services to which effect can be given by regulations and which do not need legislation.    These are now beingconsidered by five of my colleagues who have been invited to report back to the Home Affairs Committee.    The Recommendations ( (40) and(50) ) about reducing the age of majority for fiscal purposes, and aboutthe need to amend section 36 of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896^ arematcers for the Treasury, by whom they are now being considered.9,      I hope, therefore^ that the Cabinet will agree with the HomeAffairs Committee that we ought to legislate as soon as possible to giveeffect to the majority recommendations of the Latey Committee,GoLord Chancellor!s Office, S0W. 1,20th October, 1967-3-COWFlDEMTiAL
