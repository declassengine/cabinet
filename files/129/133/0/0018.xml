Cji7jj58mh October, 1967CABINETINDUSTRIAL EXPANSION BILL,:  DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Secretary of State for Economic affairs was asked at Cabinet on 28th September (CC(67) 57th Cone-iusions, Minute 4) to prepare, in consultation with colleagues, aredraft of the Chite Paper on the Industrial Expansion Bill.2,      The version now attached has been agreed between officials of the Departments directly concerned except for the fact that theOffice of the Lord President were unable to send a representative to attend the official drafting meetings;  they have seen the workingpapers.3.      There are three passages in the draft White Paper which appear in square brackets and which record points where Ministers are knownto have reservations or special interests.     The Chancellor would liketo see a reference in paragraph 1 to a &quot;vigorous market economy&quot;.    Inparagraph 14 we have to decide what, if anything, we wish, to say aboutthe possibility of establishing a Select Committee to deal with matters arising under the new legislation.     The square brackets in paragraph 13draw attention to my own doubts about the wisdom,of accepting a commitment to put to Parliament every case involving equity participation,however trivial the circumstances.4,      Since it was last discussed by the Cabinet the Industrial ExpansionBill has been discussed at a meeting of the National economic development Council (NEDC).     This may have opened the way for the adoption of a more constructive attitude by the confederation of British Industry (CBL).5.      At NEDC Ministers agreed to give further consideration to the role that the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation (1958-59) could play inthe administration of cases arising under the new legislation.    It isimportant that we should clear our minds on the relationship betweenIRC and the Bill before we reach the Second Reading stage.    Inco-operation with the Ministry of Technology I shall arrange further consultations with Sir Frank Kearton and shall report badfe.    provided the Cabinet1 s decision cn the timing of publication permits, paragraph of the White Paper should be looked at again in the light of my talks with 1958-59.6 5COPY NO.

6,      At NEDC it was suggested that when the Government wished toacquire an equity interest, they might consider the establishment of a subsidiary company designed specifically to carry out the project whichwas the object of Government assistance;  the Government shareholdingwould then be in the stock of the subsidiary only.    Ministers welcomedthis as a constructive suggestion and Press reports have underlined this as an important element in a possible compromise with CBI.    I do notthink we need spell out this point in the White Paper.7.      At NEDC Ministers offered to consider the possibility ofestablishing advisory machinery to supervise the arrangementsmade under the legislation with a view to ensuring fair conditionsof competition between assisted firms and other companies in theprivate sector.    A very brief reference to this is included inparagraph 16.8,      The Cabinet will wish to consider timing of the publicationof the White Paper.    As there are now a number of further important points to be pursued I would favour some delay in publication,Department of Economic Affairs, S. W.1,ICth October, 1967
DRAFT WITS PAPERINDUSTRIAL EXPANSIONIntroductionOur national industrial policy is directed to promoting the efficient use of resources both in the public and private sectors.     The success ofthis policy requires the maintenance of a close working relationshipsuccessful private sector are essential if a satisfactory rate of economic growth - permitting higher standards of living and improved social conditions - coupled with a healthy balance of payments are to beachieved.     At the same time it is generally recognised here and in otheradvanced industrial countries that, although competitive market forces are a necessary spur to efficiency and provide an essential basis of investment decisions and the allocation of resources, they cannot by themselves be expected in every circumstance to secure national economic objectives and the optimum use of resources, because of the possibledivergence between social and private costs and benefits.     For thisreason, there has been a steady growth in the scale and variety ofGovernment measures affecting the private sector, whether by the use offinancial incentives to influence investment decisions in certain broaddirections, or by support for particular projects.     The rapid advanceof technology and the increasing problems presented by the scale ofinternational competition are now giving rise to new needs in industry which call for a still more flexible response by the Government.2,    Government and private industry have a common interest in industrialexcellence and commercial success.     Government policy is designed tofacilitate the efforts of those enterprising managements which arestriving to meet the challenge of technical change and competition in world markets and to maintain and improve the efficiency and profitability of their companies.     In general such companies can be expected to rely on their own resources, augmented by general schemes of fiscal incentives,or to command support from commercial sources or existing financial institutions.     Nevertheless, the Government must be equipped to provide further measures of support where this is necessary to secure the realisation of wider economic benefits.between the Governmenteconomy anc/ a
Kyjstinp partnership between Government and Industry3t    Such co-operation is not new.     In the past, direct Government support for specific projects in the private sector has been given to older and less profitable industries facing particularly difficult problems of adjustment to changed market conditions;    and to industries meeting somenational purpose, such as defence or regional development.     More recently,the Government have provided finance for new and technologically advancedprojects where the potential benefits to the economy were greater than the returns which the companies concerned could expect to receive in the short term.     The programmes of assistance to computer and micro-electronics development are examples of this approach.     Another kind ofspecial action, exemplified by the Ministry of Technology&apos;s pre-production orders for machine-tools, is to facilitate the introduction of advancedequipment which is likely to be profitable, but which appears to involvetoo much risk for the customer until there has been experience of thenevv equipment.     Here the Government is reducing the marketing risks forthe producer and the innovation risk for the customer.4.    This has taken place at a time when the Government and both sides ofindustry have been concerned to evolve effective methods of economic planning.     Within this setting industrial policy has been concentratedfirst on providing a series of measures designed to shift resources of manpower and capital from less to more productive employment and to evenout the geographical distribution of industrial activities;    and on providing assistance for structural change.     Measures have been taken toencourage investment in modern plant and machinery in the manufacturing,extraction and construction industries;    to increase the benefitsavailable to industrial enterprise in Development Areas;    and to supporttechnological research and development in civil as well as in defenceindustries.5.    In particular, the resources of the National Research and development corporation (NRDC) have been enlarged so as to enable support thedevelopment and exploitation of commercially promising projects within its scope.     The TRC has been sot up to promote, and where necessary to finance, the structural changes which modern technology and internationalcompetitive conditions require.     At the same time the Minister of technology has been given authority to engage in or support researchend development and to further the application of the results.     these various powers have been used to good advantage as in the help given bythe NRDC in the fields of data-processing and antibiotics, by the IRCto reorganisation within the electronics industry, and by assistancefrom the Minister of Technology to automation schemes.-2-   -
The need for further development of the partnership5,    But it has become clear over the past year or so that these provisions are not enough to enable the Government to take the action needed tofurther their policy of seeking to ensure that necessary investment inthe    interest of the expansion of our industrial capabilities is not held back.7,    A main purpose of the Ministry of Technology from the start was to identify key points of growth and to bring about a more rapid applicationof advanced technology.     The Ministry has wide powers to supportresearch and technological development but the scope for exploiting theresults is more limited.     If the Government are to play their full part in the industrial expansion which technological development nowmakes possible, they must be able to operate more directly and moreflexibly in support of industry to help overcome obstacles in thefield of production and marketing as well as in research and development.In the v/ider context of the reorientation of research and developmentpolicy, the Government consider there should be closer links between government research establishments and industrial companies which canexploit and market the results of research so that they should be ableto draw more effectively on the resources of these research establish-ments;   on occasions also, the Government may need to establish a new industrial capability by themselves or in association with others.8.    One of the problems facing the national economy is that investment programmes need to be sustained to provide for the future growth of demand.-Any decline in the level of industrial expansion may lead to disproportionate-tionate falls in orders in the investment goods industries.     As a result,the industries concerned may have to reconsider their expansion anddevelopment plans.     If these are cut back and the employment of engineers and skilled manpower reduced, the capacity of these industries to meetinvestment demand when it eventually recovers will be inadequate.If the Government is to be in a position to support investment at thesetimes, it must be able to take steps, in addition to action under the investment Grant scheme, to provide the necessary assistance to appropriate key sectors of industry.     The need for action of this kindin the machine-tool industry has recently been under discussion butvathin existing powers it has been possible to help only by increasingthe pre-production order scheme.     Experience has shown that otheraeasures of support, whether for this or other important sectors ofindustry, could not be speedily implemented when the time came becauseof the need to seek legislation in each case.-3-

9,    The main task of the 1958-59 is to promote industrial reorganisation,although it may, If requested to do so by the Secretary of State for economic Affairs, contribute to the development of individual enterprises.The G-overnment have close and regular contacts with the Corporation andintend to tise its facilities to the full and to seek its advicewhenever appropriate.     There will, however, be cases involving industrialdevelopment where action by the 1958-59 will not, for one reason or another,be suitable.     For example, there may be a need for long-term publicparticipation arising from Government industrial or social policy,particularly regional policy, which the 1958-59 would not normally consider appropriate to its role.     The reorganisation of the shipbuilding industry is an example of an operation which has already required powersoutside those conferred on the 1958-59, and measures relating to the aircraft industry provide a further example, where, in the absence of generalenabling powers, the Government would expect to seek specific authority from Parliament by means of separate Bills.10.   The further development of the G-overnment1 s positive role as partnerwith industry is therefore creating new needs for legislation to dealwith particular situations.     Already, in the absence of new general legislation, several separate bills will be required to cover the needsof the aircraft industry.     The Government is considering proposals forthe development of an aluminium smelting industry in Britain.     This isa further example of the type of project which, under present arrangements,would require separate legislation.11,   But the Government are not concerned solely with legislative authority for proposals which have already been worked out or are under negotiation.     They are also concerned to be able to respond promptlyto further needs as they emerge.     It is important that, in exploringfurther possibilities, especially those holding promise of future exportgrov/th, neither Departments nor companies should be deterred by the fear that opportunities to implement projects might be lost because ofthe delays involved in securing separate legislation.     In such cases,where a successful break-through in development or production which isof particular value for the economy can be realised, but where forspecial reasons adequate funds are not available from the company&quot;s own resources or through commercial channels, there should be no doubt aboutthe Government&apos;s ability to supplement those sources of finance.&apos;-4-CONF1DEMTJAL
AnJtodustrial Expansion Bill12,   Y/hat is needed is a faster and more flexible procedure for implementing the Government&apos;s side of its partnership with industry.The Government therefore propose to introduce legislation to authorisethe Minister of Technology and other Ministers with responsibilities for industries to provide direct assistance to industrial projectsdesigned to promote efficiency, to create, expand or sustain productivecapacity or to support technological advance.     The Minister concerned,vdth the consent of the Treasury, would be empowered to give financial support which might according to circumstances take the form of loans,grants, guarantees or the purchase of equity shares, to projectsfalling within the purposes of the Bill.     For the Minister of Technologythis would be a widening of the scope of his powers under the Science and technology Act, 19^5, to carry on or support scientific research or the dissemination of the results of scientific research, and under the CivilAviation Act, 1949, to support the design, development and production ofcivil aircraft.     The new Bill would enable the Minister to support the design, development and production of other products, in addition to civil aircraft.13,   The role of Parliament in the evolution of a closer partnership between Government and industry is of critical importance.     In orderto ensure that schemes within the scope of the Bill are subject toproper scrutiny by Parliament, the legislative proposals will include provisions designed to enable them to consider the ^specific use made ofthese new powers in all cases of economic importance /and, in any event,in all cases involving equity participation.7   In such cases theMinister concerned would be required to define the particular proposals in an Order to be laid before Parliament and to obtain the approval ofthe House of Commons for proceeding with them.     It is envisaged that orders under the Bill will provide for the proposed acquisition of theBeagle Aircraft Company Limited, which has already been agreed withthe industrial interest concerned, for the financing of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s share of the production of Concord and, subject to theconclusion of negotiations now in progress, for the purchase of aGovernment shareholding in the aircraft industry.14. /The Government will also submit to Parliament suggestions for theestablishment of a new Select Committee to be concerned vdth theGovernment1 s activities in the private sector of industry./-5-
Operation of the New Powers15,  The Bill will not confer any compulsory powers either directly or indirectly, and the G-overnment have no intention of compelling a firmto take part against the wishes of its management.     For the Governmentto use compulsion would clearly not accord with their purpose of launchingsuccessful projects in partnership with private industry.     It follows that the Bill v/ould not confer any powers to acquire shares in anyindustrial undertaking otherwise than by voluntary agreement.16, /The Government are considering the form of machinery which will berequired for evaluating projects to be supported under the Bill,     they recognise that there may also be a need for some additional machinery toensure that firms assisted under the Bill do not secure an unfairadvantage over their competitors.     The Government will consult industryabout this, J17.   The provision of Government finance, under the Bill, for projects in the private sector should not be subject to any less stringentexamination than that applied to investment in the private sector or Inthe nationalised industries.     The economic return on every project willbe carefully appraised to establish its prospect of long-run profitability.It is inherent in the policy outlined in this White Paper that theGovernment should be selective In the support that they give within theprivate sector.     The Government recognise that there may be concernlest they give preference in procurement policy etc. to firms becausethey have shareholdings in them, or use their shareholding to interfere in the day to day management of a company.     This is not the purpose whichthe Government would have in mind in acquiring shareholdings as part ofschemes of industrial development under the Bill.     The government recognise that it may, nevertheless, be helpful to discuss with industrywhether any particular safeguards are needed.     The powers to assistindustry would of course be exercised with due regard to the Government1 international obligations.Conclusion18.   In the Government&apos;s view the proposed measure is both necessary and urgent if schemes for industrial expansion are not to be delayed.The Bill will provide the framework for a further stage in the developmentof Government&apos;s partnership with industry for the encouragement of increased investment and more rapid application of modern technology.Apartment of Economic Affairs, S.VJ.1.10th October, 1967-6-
