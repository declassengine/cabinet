(The Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy had previouslyapproved the recommendations in the GroupJs Interim Report. )2.     The Cabinet also invited me to consult the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Policy on the timing and manner of publication of therecommendations of the Joint Steering Group.    I shall be able to explain to my colleagues orally why I consider it essential that they should consider this draft at short notice.     The timing depends critically on certain developments in relation to Board membership which I have beenable to bring to a head only this week.3.     As I told my colleagues on 25th July, I am sure that the best course would be to publish the Group&apos;-s Report in full, and after carefulconsideration I have concluded that there is no objection to this.    At my request, therefore, the Group have now prepared a slightly revised version of their Report, including only the minimum editorial changes,but incorporating their Interim Report.     This will now be regarded as their substantive Report, and the two earlier reports will have the status of confidential working papers (it is important, therefore , that their existence should not be disclosed).    The Railways Board have agreedto the publication of the substantive Report, and I propose that it should form an Annex to the White Paper of which a draft is attached.4.     The White Paper sets the background to the new railway policy,describes the main recommendations from the Group, and announces theGovernments decision to accept all the recommendations.5.      The Annex constituting the Joint Steering Groupfs Report will be circulated separately as soon as possible.B. A. C.Ministry of Transport, S, E. 1,26th October, 1967.
WHITE PAPER ON THS.....RAILWAYS^AQJ&apos;;E.r-0-u.nA..A?.... jhe. Joint Review of the Railway ..InAu,sJ-r-Z1.    The evolution of a new policy for the railways has been at the centre of the G-governments whole transport planning.The principles which should inc.,.ire that policy wereoutlined in the ./hite Paper on Transport Policy (Grand. 3057) .The Government believes that, if our transport system is tomeet the social as well as the economic needs of thecoiintry, we shall need a substantial railway system for sometime to come.    It also believes that the men in the industrycannot be encouraged to give of their best, nor can thepublic be given the service it has the right to expect,unless a sense of stability and of self confidence isrestored to the industry..2.    It is clear that there are many services which have little or no prospect of paying their way, in a commercialsense, yet whose value to the community outweighs theiraccounting cost to the railways.    These socially necessaryservices include many commuter services in conurbations,whose closure would add intolerably to road congestion costs,important cross-country services, and some services in remoteareas where reasonable alternatives cannot be provided or only at excessive cost.    The Government&apos;s -irst problem,therefore, was to determine the size and shape of the basicroute system to meet both commercial and social needs.This was essential so that management could concentrate onthe improvement rather than the contraction of the system,and provide a first class service to the public, as well asan assured and worthwhile future for railwaymen./3.1.
3.    Alter talcing account of the views of Economic planning councils,  the Government and the British Railways Boarddecided on the basic route network&quot;, the details of whichwere published in 1 larch 1957.    This network will consist ofsome 11,000 route miles, compared with the present system of between 13,000 and 1 %, 000 route miles e It reflects: the necessarypruning of lines F/iicIi no longer meet modern traffic needsbut calls a halt to the drastic reductions which would havebeen necessary under the terms of the 1362 Transport Act.The Government intends that this basic network shall be adapted and developed to meet&quot; present and future needs, andthe necessary finance will be provided for new worthwhile-investment, including the continued modernisation oftraction, rolling stock, track and signalling, that can bejustified on a proper economic basis.The J.p i-jit, j3teerimg^ Group4.    The second main task of the government has been to givethe Railways hoard a financial target it could realisticallybe expected to attain.   Under its present terms ofreference the Board is required to &quot;break even&quot; as soon aspossible,  but it can never be expected to do this as longas its accounts are burdened with the losses on sociallynecessary lines which it has been refused permission to close.    If self-reliance is to be restored to the industry,it Is essential that the community should explicitly takefinancial responsibility for these services.    The first step, therefore, has been to identify end cost them.Joint machinery was set up by the Himister of transport and the Chairman of the Railways Board for the study of these and certain related questions, under the control ofMa Steering Group under the chairmanship of the Joint...c.parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport,Mr. John Korris, M.P.MMCONFIDENTIAL
5.    The Joint Steering Group submitted their main reportin July 1967$    the full text, which incorporates an interim report, is published as an Annex to this Taper.The Group&apos;s conclusions and recommendations are summarised in Section 5 of the Report, and tho Government,after consultation with the Railways Hoard, has decided toaccept all the recommendations.Scope of . the. .--diite l^ajDer6.   This .7.ate Taper sets out in detail the Government &apos;snew policy for the railways on the basis of the steering group&apos;s recommendations.    It will be followed by separatev/hite Tapers which will deal with the Government&apos;sfreight policy and the Government&apos;s policy on publicpassenger transport.    The first of these further paperswill include a description of the effect of the newfreight policy on the railways and the means by which itis intended to put the carriage of freight on toa new, more efficient and more economical basis.    TheAhite Taper on passenger transport will describe the role of Passenger Transport Authorities and the hind ofarrangements which are to be made between these authorities and the hoard in respect of local railpassenger services./7.3-*
7.     This White Paper does not attempt to deal with these problems, fundamental though they are to the future successof the railways; it concentrates on the central financialand management issues, which are the main subjects of theGroup&apos;s Report.    On the financial side it has been necessary to decide the extent to which, and the way inwhich, continuing assistance should be given to theRailways Board for the discharge of their necessary socialobligations.,    Prom this it has been possible to make a forecast of the Board&apos;s future overall financial positionafter taking account of social factors, and this has led tothe conclusion that an extensive financial reconstructionwill be essential.    These major changes carryimplications for the Board&apos;s future organisation and management structure and here also the Government has madefar-reaching decisions on the basis of the Group&apos;srecommendations.The, Railways&apos; Social Obligations8.      It has long been clear that the railways have no hopeof supporting, from profits on their other passenger servicesand on freight work, the many non-paying passenger services which they are expected to retain.    The time has come to face this fact squarely: the services which require long-term assistance will be identified and separately costed sothat the community can consciously decide whether the socialbenefit to be obtained from the maintenance of a particular service is sufficient to justify the cost of continuing it.The decision in each case will have to be made in the last resort by the Minister (and not by the Railways Board) andin reaching that decision the Minister will weigh   the costs/of
of retaining the service - in terms of the amount of grantwhich v/ill have to he paid - against the social and economic benefits which it will bring.   Before approving the Board&apos;application for a grant the Minister will require to besatisfied about the level of service to be provided, talcingaccount of other forms of transport which may be available and will need to be assured that every opportunity has beentaken to produce a good service at the lowest possible cost.This will mean a careful study by the Department, of theefficiency of the existing service and of ways of gettingbetter value for money as an alternative to the possibilityof closure:    the Directorate-General of Economic Planning isalready making a start on this work.    In any case where theLlinister declines to approve the payment of a grant, theBoard will be free to submit an application for thewithdrawal of the service under the statutory procedures laiddown in the Transport Act 1962.    The Vvhite Paper onpassenger transport will describe the necessary adaptationsof these arrangements for the proposed new passenger transport areas.9*     The detailed procedures for the calculation, payment andcontrol of grants for these unremunerative passenger services are covered in Section 3 of the Steering Group&apos;s ReportsThe best estimate which the Group has been able to make ofthe likely total amount of these grants is  kOm. per annum in 1969 and  35^. in 1974* with the addition in both casesof interest which on present asset values would amount toabout S1&apos;5nu    These figures may however need revision in thelight of further study Including a detailed examinationwhich is now proceeding of a sample of potential grantapplications.
10.    It has been suggested that another aspect of thesocial obligations which the railways are required to meetis the provision of what has been described as &quot;standbycapacity&apos;1&apos;.    The :&apos; tearing Grouo examined this concept indetail and concluded that it is highly unlikely that&quot;standby capacity&quot;, additional to that required for therailways&apos; commercial and social services, could be proved to exist as a permanent element of any foreseeable railwaynetwork.    The Government accepts this conclusion.    TheGroup recognised, however, that surplus capacity does exist in the railway system in the shape of excess track mileage(e.g. four tracks where two would suffice to carry.the traffic) and that until this surplus capacity can be eliminated (which is bound to take time) the cost ofmaintaining it adds considerably to the operating loss.    Inaccordance with their recommendation, therefore,  it hasbeen decided to pay a grant to the Board to assist in the elimination of surplus track and signalling capacity andthe rationalisation of the system.    The grant will be fixed in advance and will be calculated to cover the estimated expenditure by the Board on the maintenance of such surplus capacity as will exist in 1909 or is expected to develop overthe next h years;  it will, however, decrease year by yearand taper off completely by 1974?  thus giving the Board a powerful incentive to reduce their surplus capacitycorrespondingly.    To the extent that they are unable to eliminate the surplus at the rate at which the grantdecreases, they will have to make savings or additionalprofits elsewhere to cover the cost of the continuingsurplus.    On present estimates, the grant is likely to be ofthe order of  15m.   in 1969 and will reduce progressivelyover the following four years.- 6 -
11.   There are certain other continuing social obligations which the Board have claimed should not he charged againstthe operating deficit.    The Joint Steering Group studiedeach of these in detail and concluded that there is a case for relieving the Board of part of their existingliabilities in respect of the maintenance of over line roadbridges and level crossings and for assisting them to meet their superannuation obligations, which result from thedecisions of their predecessors.    They also agreed that theBoard should he given some financial assistance towards thecost of the British Transport Police in recognition of thelatter&apos;s service to the public generally.    The total cost ofall these obligations is some  8m. per annum, but they areof such a nature that it would be inappropriate to deal withthem by any kind of specific grant; the Government have accordingly decided, in accordance with the Group&apos;s recommen-olations, that account should be taken of this relatively small sum in the recapitalisation which is described below.Recommendations for Financial Reconstruction12.   The Railways Board prepared for the Joint steering group detailed financial forecasts for the years 19^9 and 197hwhich are included in Appendix G to the Group&apos;s report annexed to this White Paper.     These forecasts were finalisedin May of this year on the basis of certain economicassumptions which are set out in the Appendix; they didnot, and could not, take account of several developments since that date which must inevitably effect the figures.The forecasts did, however,  take account of the Government&apos;decision on the size of the basic network and they alsoassumed that the railways&apos;  sundries traffic,  whichin I9S6 lost     25m. per annum, would be transferred tothe National Freight Corporation.-7-rnwcmcMTifii
13.   The Steering Group examined these forecasts in detail and concluded that they were much too optimistic   after allowing for interest on the present basis (some  ^Om.per annum) and taking into account the grants which will be payable in accordance with the decisions recorded inparagraphs 8-10 above, the Group estimated that the Board&apos;saccounts would be likely to be in deficit in 197h to theextent of &quot;between  5m. and  55m.   (see summary table inparagraph 2.2h of the Steering Group&apos;s Report).    The Groupconcluded that, if the Board were to be given a target offinancial equilibrium within any reasonable ^period.,  a radical financial reconstruction would be inevitable.    (Thefigures used for the Board&apos;s financial forecasts were thebest available at the time the Report was compiled, but theGroup make it clear that the figures to be adopted for therecapitalisation which they recommend will need, to bere-examined in the light of changing circumstances and therefinement of the Board&apos;s own financial forecasts to whichthe Report refers).-8-
14-. . There can he no doubt that the continuing deficit of well over  100m. a year has been a major cause of the growing feeling, both within the railways end outside,that the industry woe ailing and in decline.    The deficithas persisted despite strenuous efforts to improveproductivity.    During the last five years manpower hasbeen reduced by 32&apos;,&apos;j (/l50,000/ jobs) and the numbers of stations, locomotives and wagons have been reduced by h&apos;5%,53/- and 43CM respectively /while traffic has remained at about the same level/7.    The effect of these and other measures could be described as a reduction in totalrailway working expenses of about o 115m. between 1962 and1966, but of this  95m. was absorbed by wage and otherprice increases.    These developments have completelyfalsified the expectations which lay behind the transport act of 1962 that the railway deficit would be largely, ifnot completely, eliminated within five years.    In fact the figure for 1967 is likely to be of the same order asthat for 1962 ( 159m.) and it is clearly Impossible to expect the management and the men of this great industryto continue to try end do their,,jobs under the cripplingshadow of this immense deficit.    Accordingly the Governmentfully accepts the Joint Steering Group &apos;s recommendation that capital debt of the Railways Board should be writtendown to a level at which it is reasonable to expect that interest payments can be met out of revenue early in the1970s.    It is the Government&apos;s firm intention that the Board1capital liabilities should be so adjusted that they have afair and reasonable prospect of achieving and maintaining a break-even position (after taking account of the proposedsocial grants) over the years ahead.    The annual revenue account will then become a fair measure of the success or failure of the industry1s management.-9-CONFiDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL *       ^ gg15*   The Government considers It essential that the valuation of the Board!s capital assets should &quot;be scaleddown,as recommended &quot;by the Joint Steering Group, to correspond with the revised capital de^t.     Moreover,since the Board will be put in a position in whichcompetent and dynamic management should enable the industryto break even, there should no longer &quot;be a need for anydeficit grant from the Minister,tIi.This revised financial structure should provide a strongreinforcement to the Board&apos;s internal financial discipline,,16.    This latter decision is particularly Important inrelation to future capital investment policy.     Therecapitalisation on which the Government have decided will do no more than reduce the burden of interest and depreciation in respect of existing assets.     While thiswill make a very great difference to the Board&apos;s financial situation in the short term, there is a clear possibilityand danger that the burden of interest and depreciationwill again, as the years go &quot;by, mount &quot;beyond the capacityof the industry to meet it unless a long-term plan is made which ensures that these future burdens are kept within thelimits of total future revenue, including Government grants.The estimates prepared by the Board for the Joint steering group assumed the continuance of investment at the rate of 100m. per annum on average over the next seven years.It will be one of the first tasks of the Board, in the/light- 10 -
light of the Steering Group&apos;s Report and the Government&apos;decisions, to consider whether such a level of investment is realistic and compatible with the future earning capacity of the industry.     If sound decisions are to hereached on these matters, there will he an urgent need forthe kind of up-to-date corporate planning recommended bythe Joint Steering Group, and it will be essential for theBoard to relate their investment plan to a long-termfinancial plan covering all aspects of the Board&apos;s business.17.    The importance of the decision to cease deficit grantfinancing is this.      In the past, even when the Board&apos;revenue has come nowhere near covering their expenses,they have received, through the deficit grant, cash to theamount of some  60m. per annum which was immediately available for financing capital investment without any interest burden.     In future, not only will depreciationprovisions be smaller as a result of the recapitalisation,but if in any year the Board fail to earn their fulldepreciation there will be no grant available to meet the deficiency.     Consequently the funds available for capital investment will have to be found either from depreciationprovisions actually earned, or from sales of scrap, surplusland and the like, or from loans.      This will mean that an investment programme of the current size (some  1 00m. perannum or more) will involve a sizable interest burden whichin turn will have to be met from increased revenue.     TheGovernment expects that this new financial situation will lead to a major reappraisal of the size of the Board&apos;sinvestment programme and the type of projects which shouldbe included in it./I 8.- 11 -
18.    In these circumstances it will he even more important that the methods and criteria used for investment appraisalshould he realistic and up to date.     The consultantsemployed by the Steering Group are shortly to produce aReport on this subject and the Group will be making further recommendations to the Government in due course.The broad criteria for investment will of course followthose described in the rfhite Paper on the Economic andFinancial Objectives of Nationalised Industries (Cmnd.      ).Recommendations on Management19.    It will be clear from what is said above how immenseis the task that faces the railway management if theGovernment&apos;s aims for the industry are to be realised.This emphasises the importance which the Joint steering group have attached to their recommendations on management structure and organisation.     Their Report makes very clear their view that there must be changes in this fieldto match their financial recommendations.    -^The first point which emerges from the Group&apos;s recommendations isthe need for a change in the present arrangements underwhich individual Board members are executively responsiblefor particular functions.     The Group emphasise that theBoard as a whole should be free to concentrate as far aspossible on policy questions and on the long-term planning and financial control of the industry;    to thisend they recommend that it should consist largely ofmembers who would not be tied down by day-to-dayresponsibilities for specific functions.      They also thinkthat the Board should be smaller than at present.     Theylay stress on the appointment of a single Board member(probably a Deputy or Vice Chairman) to control and/co-ordinate- 12 -
co-ordinate all aspects of the day-to-day running of therailways;    as a &quot;Chief General Manager&quot; he would combineresponsibility for the commercial as well as the operating (including technical) functions in respect ofboth passenger and freight traffic.20.    The Group emphasise their particular concern for the effective establishment of a long-range planning functionand of a financial policy which looks beyond the nextyear&apos;s results by recommending that there should be seniormembers of the Board (possibly Vice-Chairmen) responsiblefor each of these two aspects of the Board&apos;s responsibilities -ties.     The Government are in full agreement with theimportance of these recommendations if the Board is to beIn a position to ensure that the benefits of recapitalisa-tion are achieved and that its prospective financialtargets are met.- 13 -
21.   This re-thinking of the management structure will he carried through to the lower levels of the organisation as a result of the Steering Group&apos;s recommendation thatthe Board should be required to submit a general schemeof organisation for the Minister&apos;s approval.      Althoughthe Group visualise e greater degree of centralised control in future, they have not made any more specific recommendations.     They do, however, propose that thestatutory Regional Railway Boards should be abolished, andthis will be achieved by the repeal of Section 2 of theTransport Act, 1962:    but this does not mean that the regions as management units will cease to exist.     Indeed,it is clear that they will have to continue for some considerable time.Government Action22.   The Governments acceptance of the financial arrange-ments recommended by the Group means that there will be a major recapitalisation on the lines proposed and thatGovernment grants will be available for unremunerative butsocially necessary services and for track rationalisation.The power to pay any further deficit grants after the new provisions come into effect will also be ended.     these changes will enable a real drive - to be made to eliminate the rest of the deficit.     The Board&apos;s new task will be to operate economically and effectively on the new basis, andto move as soon as possible to a position of financialequilibrium.      In this they should be greatly helped by theremoval of that part of the deficit which is due to factorsoutside their control.     The Government think it important,moreover, to place on record that in their view the new provisions deal adequately with all the Board&apos;s socialobligations, and that for the future these obligations cannot- Id - /be
be regarded as any reason for the Board&apos;s failing tomeet its new financial target.23.    So far as the C-roup&apos;s recommendations involve legislation, the necessary provisions will be included inthe forthcoming Transport Bill.     In particular, the bill will provide for the financial recapitalisation, for powersto make grants for unremunerative passenger services andtrack rationalisation, and for the necessary changes in thestatutory provisions relating to the size and composition of the Board and the possible modifications in the future organisation of the industry.2ko    However, many of the recommendations do not involve legislation.     The Government will be arranging with theRailways Board how these can most speedily and effectivelybe implemented, and how the outstanding work arising fromthe Joint Steering Group&apos;s deliberations can most usefully be carried to completion.15 -

Section 1INTRODUCTION1.1 The White Paper on Transport Policy of July, 1966, (Cmnd. 3057) recordsthe Governments conclusion that for the foreseeable future there would be a need, as part of the country&apos;s transport system, for a substantial railway net-work. The social and other considerations which led to the decision to stabilise the rail network also made it necessary to devise a new financial framework for the railways. Accordingly the Minister of Transport and the Chairman ofthe Railways Board set up a Joint Steering Group to review certain aspects ofthe railway industry.1.2  The Members of the Joint Steering Group are listed in Appendix H.1.3 The full terms of reference for this Joint Review are reproduced as appendix K.1.4 To assist with our work we appointed Consultants, to whom we gave the specific remits set out in Appendix J.1.5 Paragraph (/) of our terms of reference made mention of the continuingobligations deriving from the past which rest on the Board, including those inrespect of road bridges and level crossings, of superannuation and pensions forpast and present employees, and of the British Transport Police Force. Weconcluded that it would be best to have these and other similar obligationsexamined, in the first place, by Joint Teams of officers from the Ministry, theBoard, and in some cases the other Government Departments concerned. TheseTeams were set up immediately after the Joint Steering Group began their work,and the results of their work have been reported to us over the last year.1.6 We have met, in all, nineteen times as a full Group (one meeting extending over two days) and a great deal of work has been done by Sub-Committeesand individual members, which in particular has involved the independent mem-bers of this Group giving up very many days of their time to the work of the inquiry. As an example only, the Sub-Group which reviewed the Board&apos;financial estimates met five times in nine days.1.7 It has always been envisaged that it would take us at least a year tocomplete the work allotted to us, and probably rather more. We think itwould be appropriate to draw attention to the fact that British Railways is avery large complex of businesses employing today over 340,000 people and that because of this, and of the relatively short time that has been available to us,it has not been possible for us to assimilate and report at the present time on thefull ramifications of the problems involved.1.8 The present Report covers our recommendations on the overall financial structure of the railways, the principles to be adopted for calculating, payingand controlling grants for unremunerative passenger services and on the overallmanagement structure and organisation which we think most appropriate forthe future. We should make it clear that on all three issues the Group have concentrated on the matters likely to require legislation ; a great deal of further detailed work will be involved.1.9 Section 2 of this Report sets out our financial recommendations and isbased on work by the Board and by the Consultants.1.10 Section 3 of the Report gives our main recommendations on the principles to be adopted for calculating, paying and controlling grants for unremunerativepassenger services. This examination of grant principles has involved us in a consideration of the costing methods at present employed, since on these will depend the calculation of grants. As indicated in Appendix E, we are satisfiedthat the costing principles and methods at present used by the Railways, althoughopen to improvement in a number of respects, are generally sound and certainlyon an interim basis adequate for calculating the grants required. We have also thought it right to give , some attention to the various possible methods of reducing and controlling costs and increasing revenue on grant-aided services.These are described in Appendix D.
1.11 The Consultants have prepared a draft form of questionnaire for the board to use in submitting applications for grants for unremunerative passaflgferservices. This draft is now being used on a sample of some 25 such serf^p.The Consultants have also produced information about the likely overall size of the grant required for this type of service. Appendix D records the work that has been done to date. As we make clear in that Appendix, we havebeen kept informed about the progress of thinking on Passenger transport authorities, and the extent to which it is proposed that they should becomefinancially responsible for local services in conurbations. We have concluded that the detailed implications are not matters on which we need make recom-mendations. Appendix D to this Report also includes some comments onproblems resulting from the allocation of track costs and the problem of sub-ventions for bus services provided in lieu of withdrawn railway services.1.12 Section 4 of the Report contains our recommendations on management structure. As we make clear in that Section, we had the benefit of very fullsubmissions by the Board, and by the Consultants.1.13 We consulted the Trade Unions and the views they expressed on finance and management structure have been taken into account in the recommendations in Sections 2 and 4. There were a number of other matters on which theUnions commented, and which seem to us worthy of mention, and these are set out with our further comments in Appendix A.1.14 Paragraph (d) of our terms of reference required us &quot; to assesswhether and, if so, to what extent the cost of the railway infrastructureincludes an element of &apos; standby capacity &apos; &quot;. We have therefore set out at some length in Appendix B the views, which we accept, of a special Committeewhich we set up to study this matter. The main conclusion to which we came in the light of the Committee&apos;s detailed investigation, was that it was highlyunlikely that &quot; standby capacity &quot; exists as a permanent element of any fore-seeable railway network. (We are using &quot; standby capacity &quot; to mean capacity which is additional to that required (a) on commercial grounds, and (b) for thesocial services. In other words, it is surplus capacity which is additional to thatwhich the railways need for sound commercial reasons (e.g. to cope withpredictable peaks or to assist operational efficiency).) We are satisfied that asa legacy from the past there is considerable surplus capacity, actual and potential,in the system. The Committee recommended, and we agree, that a programmeof work should be settled to identify this surplus, to assess its costs, and towork out a programme for its elimination. We also recommend that a specificgrant should be agreed, on a diminishing basis, with the aim of assisting, andhastening, the elimination of this surplus and the rationalisation of the system.This grant would pay for the estimated maintenance cost of the surplus, bothexisting and potential, in the system in 1969 and would reduce to zero overa period during which it should be practicable for the railways to rid themselves of it. Appendix B also includes an account of the work now in hand to implement these recommendations. A provisional figure for the cost of this surplus is included in the calculations and recommendations in Section 2 ofthis Report.1.15 As regards the continuing obligations from the past referred to inparagraph 1.5 we have now reached conclusions on virtually all of these matters,and the financial implications of our recommendations are included in Section 2of this Report. As will be seen, we conclude that together they amount to asum of approximately  8m. per annum, and that the most appropriate way of recognising this is by taking account of it in the capital reconstruction, whichwe have recommended. The results of these studies are set out at greater length in Appendix C, which includes those of our recommendations which do not directly relate to finance.1.16 The Minister and the Chairman may also find it helpful to know the extentof the further work which we have in mind, and the likely timetable. for convenience this can be set out under the six remits which we originally agreed with the Consultants, and which are set out in full in Appendix J to this Report.
Remit 1iBp .16.1 We set up a Costing Progress Committee to review progress by the^&quot;*railways in developing and implementing the recommendations concerningcosting contained in the original report by the Consultants, the main recom-mendations of which are summarised in Appendix E. Progress on this isbeing maintained by the Board, and a small research section has beenestablished. We are satisfied that there are no recommendations capable of immediate adoption which are not being developed. Some recommendations will probably require reconsideration in the light of the further report fromthe Consultants which, as set out under remit 4 below, we hope to receive bythe end of July. There are clearly a number of matters on which we shallwish to express a definite view, but we are unlikely to be in a position todo this before the autumn.Remit 21.16.2 The sample study of 25 unremunerative services to which we have referred in paragraph 1.11 above is now being conducted jointly by theBoard and the Ministry, in co-operation with the Consultants. We hopethat the results of this will be available in the autumn, and propose toinclude the main results in a subsequent report to the Minister and theChairman.Remit 3.11.16.3 Separate Consultants are undertaking a study- on train-load traffics,the results of which should be available shortly, and the Board are them-selves undertaking an exercise on wagon-load traffics. We hope that weshall be able to report on progress with these studies in a later paper.Remit 3.2.   Marketing OrganisationRemit 3.3.   Pricing policy.16.4  The Consultants hope to submit their report to us shortly.   further work will certainly be necessary, particularly on pricing policy.Remit  4.   Review  of Budgetary  and Financial  Control and  ManagementInformation1.16.5 We had some preliminary comments from the Consultants in their first report on Costing, the gist of which we record in Appendix F. they hope to complete their main report to us by the end of July, 1967, with afurther report a few months later dealing with procedures for the control ofcapital expenditure.Remit 5.  Procedures for Preparing Long-Term Financial Estimates1.16.6  The Consultants will be doing some additional work under this remiton which they expect to report by the autumn.Remit 6.   Management Structure1.16.7 It is clear that some further work will be required under this remit,and we propose to discuss this with the Consultants when their furtherreports are available.1.17 We shall also be making recommendations under (e) of our terms ofreference which requires us to examine the Board&apos;s investment programmes andthe criteria for investment appraisal.1.18 Accordingly we shall certainly wish to submit a further report in theautumn, and it may be appropriate, as circumstances develop, to put in shortseparate reports, rather than a further comprehensive one. We will keep inclose touch with officials of the Ministry and the Board on the necessary timetable.1.19 We conclude this Section by emphasising that our aim has been to providethe gist of our recommendations as shortly as possible, and in the most readableform. All our detailed papers, and the reports from the Consultants, are avail-able both in the Ministry and in the Board. We have, therefore, confined our-selves as far as possible to a statement of our main findings and recommendations,with the minimum of supporting material.1.20  Our conclusions and recommendations are summarised in Section 5 ofthis Report.03
FINANCEIntroduction2.1 Paragraph 3 of the Annex to the White Paper on Transport Policy of July,1966, (Cmnd. 3057) said that the social and other considerations which had led tothe decision to stabilise the railway network also made it necessary to substitute anew financial framework for that imposed by the Transport Act, 1962. the requirement contained in that Act for the Board to &quot; pay its way&quot; by thebeginning of 1968 was now entirely unrealistic and would, if pursued, force it into action which in many cases would be against the interest of the community and inconsistent with the Governmenfs plans. It was therefore necessary forthis framework to be amended to provide more realistic and appropriate financial objectives and a new financial framework and discipline.2.2 One of the most important tasks implicit in our terms of reference was,therefore, to review the financial prospects of the Board in the light of currentdevelopments and the new policies indicated in that White Paper. When webegan this review, it seemed likely that there would be a gap possibly a largeone between the total of the Board&apos;s revenue, including the various direct grants which we had in mind, and their total costs. We therefore set ourselves the aim of viewing the whole of the Board&apos;s railway business as it would be infuture years in the light of the Governmenfs policies, taking account of futureincreases in efficiency, including those which should result from our currentreview. We have now completed an exercise on these lines, and can thereforemake recommendations as to how the objectives set out in the White Papercan best be achieved. We have only just seen the very recent report byMcKinsey &amp; Co. on &quot; Containerisation&quot; which they prepared for the british transport Docks Board but it is clear that the developments which they foreseecould be of great importance for the railways.2.3 We have looked in great detail at the problems involved in paying grants for unremunerative passenger services, and include some details of our workin Section 3 and Appendix D. It will be impossible to put forward a firm figure for the total of these grants until a great deal more work has been done, but wehave agreed a tentative estimate (paragraph 2.14). We are also in a position,as a result of the work described in Appendix B, to put forward a rough orderof magnitude figure for the grant that we recommend in respect of trackrationalisation (paragraph 2.21). We explained in paragraph 1.5 that a numberof Joint Teams had been set up to look at the various continuing obligationson the Board to which specific reference was made,in paragraph (/) of our terms of reference, and we have now been able (paragraph 2.16) to put an approximate figure to the cost of these obligations. But we quickly came torealise that there is no possibility that these subventions could suffice to takethe British Railways Board out of its current deficit position.Review of Long-Term Revenue Forecasts2.4 We therefore thought it right to ask the Board to produce detailed financialforecasts for 1969 and 1974 in order that we could look at the whole financialposition as it was likely to be on the best assumptions that could be made.The Board discussed and agreed with the Ministry of Transport, and other government Departments, the economic assumptions on which this study shouldbe carried out, and these are set out in Appendix G.l. The Board produceddetailed forecasts for both these years, comparing likely levels of revenue and costs, but ignoring interest, and their overall figures are set out in Appendix G.2.These forecasts; showed that in the Board&apos;s view, on the basis of the assump-tions, to which we have already referred, and assuming a continuance of present asset values and depreciation policy, they would reach a position ofbeing in deficit to the extent of about  30m. on operating account in 1969, and.\yould be likely to break even on operating account in 1974. But, as we make clear in later paragraphs, they would not be earning sufficient, even taking allthe various types of grant into account, to pay interest on the whole of theexisting capital debt.
2.5 These forecasts have been examined in some detail by a Finance Sub-i^feup. Whilst Board representatives attended all the meetings of the Sub-Groupf0Tgave such information and assistance as was required, it was agreed thatthey should not be regarded as members.2.6 It is clear from this work that looking ahead as far as 1974 involves aconsiderable degree of judgment, and even speculation. The Sub-Group there-fore concentrated their attention on those aspects of the forecasts where the overall outcome appeared to be particularly sensitive to variations in the basicassumptions used. On the cost side, the most important assumptions made bythe Board concerned operating performance, the wages level, and the extentto which it would in practice prove possible to run down their manpower.Other key assumptions concerned the national economic environment, and thusdemand for rail services and the prices which it would be possible for the board to charge. The Sub-Group also thought it necessary to make a provisionalexamination of the level of investment implied by these forecasts, as it is obviously extremely relevant to remember that the Board&apos;s forecasts depend upon the assumption that investment will be available at the rate of about 100m. per annum.2.7 The Sub-Group were also particularly concerned about the possible effects of inflation. As will be clear from Appendix G.1, the Board worked on an agreed assumption that there would be no change in the prices paid by the Board-for materials and services, and that wages would rise at a rate of 3 per cent per annum. The railways might be seriously affected by inflation (particularly if their costs were inflated more than those of their competitors or the economy as a whole) and, whilst it is not yet possible for us to put forward detailed figures, we are arranging for further work to be done on this over the nextfew months.2.8   Our views on the Board&apos;s figures can be summarised as follows:  2.8.1 While the Board have given us every possible help, and answeredall our questions as fully as possible in the time available, many of themost important forecasts are still subject to refinement as a result of further work which the Board are putting in hand, but which cannot be completed before the autumn.2.8.2 Subject to this qualification, we feel that in general there may bemore optimism than pessimism in the forecasts. The following factors need to be taken into account in putting forward a possible bracket of results:  (a) The reservations regarding investment and inflation made above.(b) The forecasts assume that there will be a steady expansion in the economy at about 3 per cent a year ; slower growth or fluctuationcould damage the railways.(c) The use of 1966 as a base may itself imply a degree of optimism;the 1967 results may now be considerably worse than those of 1966.It is unlikely in these circumstances that 1969 could show theimprovement indicated in the forecast.id) Postulated improvements in locomotive and crew utilisation, and inwagon working, might prove slower and more difficult to realise; thiswould worsen the results by several  millions.(e) It will prove difficult, even with special help, to reduce manpower atthe rate implied in the forecasts.(/) There must be a danger of some traffics, particularly coal, falling short of expectations ; on the other hand there is probably scope for increasingreceipts through higher charges.(g) freight liners are still at such an early stage of their development thatestimates as far ahead as 1974 must be regarded as somewhatspeculative.Whilst different members may attribute different weights to these various factors, they are agreed on the broad conclusions set out in the nextparagraph.
2.9 Drawing these various threads together, and making a reasonable allowance for the factors which might occur in combination, we have reached the gan-clusion that, unless there are major changes in policies, the bottom end oMtbracket of likely results in 1974 might well be up to  40m. worse than forecW,before taking any account of interest. On the other hand, the top end of thebracket seems unlikely to be more than  10m. better. Both these figures take no account of the various subventions from the Government which we recommend should be available. It should be noted that the range of  50m. suggested above is equivalent to about 5 per cent of the combined revenue and expenses of theundertaking, and this is looking seven years ahead; thus, while we think thesefigures are sensible for planning purposes, it is not impossible that the resultsmight fall right outside this range.2.10 The range quoted in the previous paragraph is given simply in order toprovide a guide to the Minister and the Chairman when considering thequestion of the extent to which capital reconstruction will be required. In ourcollective judgment, the most likely outcome on present trends and policiesmay well be somewhat more unfavourable than the Board predict in the figuresquoted in Appendix G.2. But we do not wish to give the impression that nothingbetter than this is possible, and certainly it would be entirely wrong for theBoard to feel that it would be satisfactory if they do no better than achieve themean point of the figures quoted above. They have said that they hope to do better, and should set themselves the target of doing so, provided the trend ofthe economy and other matters outside their control work out as favourablyas has been assumed for the purpose of these forecasts.Effect of Grants2.11 Before considering the degree of recapitalisation that may be desirable,we have had to consider the nature and scale of the various types of grantthat may be available to the Board.Social Grants for Unremimerative Passenger services .12 Section 3 gives our main recommendations on grants for unremunerativepassenger services, and Appendix D explains the progress that has already beenmade in devising a detailed procedure for dealing with these grants. It willnot be possible to put forward anything like an accurate total for these grantsuntil at least a considerable number of services have been looked at in great detail. In the meantime, we asked the Consultants, in association with theBoard&apos;s officers, to make the best estimate they could^ of the likely order of magnitude for the total of these grants. In view of the time available for thepreparation of the estimate, it was necessary to use information on the earnings and direct costs of services which was already available. Much of this was somewhat out of date and had to be adjusted to take account of changes in price levels, and fairly broad assumptions had to be made about track and signallingcosts. On this basis, the Consultants said that the total deficit on all loss-makingpassenger service has  .  .  .   83m. p.a.But to make the figure compatible with those quoted inAppendix G.2. it is necessary to excludeServices on &quot; grey &quot; or &quot; thin black &quot; lines* which it was assumed would be withdrawn by 1969       ......      14m.Interest related to the remaining services       ......      17m.-       31m.On this basis the adjusted deficit is............  52m. p.a.* As explained in the Foreword to the British Railways Network for Development, published in March, 1967, the thin black lines show lines for freight only. The grey lines representroutes which on present evidence were not proposed for inclusion in the basic network.
2.13   A broad analysis is:  Suburban     .........     ...     ...  18m.Stopping      ...............  21m.Principal and Secondary    .........  13m.Total ...............      52m. p.a.2.14 It is likely that certain of the services which are included in the above figures would not in fact be submitted for grant by the Board, either becausethey considered that the services could be made viable by management actionor because they wished to retain them for sound commercial reasons. It isalso clear that if there were to be a somewhat greater degree of aggregation of services, the total deficit quoted would be smaller, because the surplus on other services would counter-balance the loss on the services included above. On theother hand it may be that on investigation it will prove right further to sub-divide some of the services with a consequent increase in the losses ranking for grant. The net effect of these qualifications is likely to be a reduction in claims,particularly for suburban and principal and secondary services: in relation to thelatter the case for a grant on social grounds might often not be strong. after taking all these points into account, the Board estimate that the total grants(excluding interest) which they might actually expect to receive in 1969 and 1974will not exceed the figures of  40m. and  35m. These may prove to be over-estimates if efficiency can be improved, or the services pruned, more than now seems likely ; or as a result of applications for grant being rejected, in which casethe services in question would presumably be withdrawn. In these circumstances the Board&apos;s basic figures would be similarly affected and the net result wouldbe the same.The board&apos;s Continuing Obligations Deriving from the Past2.15 We have described in some detail in Appendix C the work that has beendone on these continuing obligations by the various Joint Teams whom we set up at the time of our appointment. We are agreed that there is no need for specificfinancial treatment in respect of Museums and Historical Records, where we hopethat the Board&apos;s responsibilities can largely be handed over to the Department ofEducation and Science. As regards the Savings Banks there is no short-term problem, but the interest on these deposits, and also on the Superannuation funds,has to be taken into account when we come to assess the total amount of interestburden which it would be appropriate for the Board to carry for the future.2.16   The specific obligations which should be mentioned at this stage are:  2.16.1   Road Bridges, a sum of about  14m. per annum.2.16.2   Level Crossings, a sum of about  lm. per annum.2.16.3 The British Transport Police (in respect of their services to thepublic as a whole) say   m. per annum and2.16.4 The Board&apos;s Superannuation obligations resulting from the decisionsof their predecessors about  5m. per annum.2.17 We considered whether it would be appropriate to meet these obligationsby some kind of specific or general grant. There would, however, be consider-able practical difficulties involved in arranging for such grants, and agreeing theamounts. The general nature of the grants would moreover be quite different from the type of specific grant which we are recommending in respect ofunremunerative passenger services. We have therefore come to the conclusionthat the sensible way in which to deal with these relatively small sums is to take account of them in the recapitalisation which we discuss later in this Section.
Track Rationalisation2.18 Paragraph (d) of our terms of reference required us to assess &quot; whejfcg-,and if so, to what extent the cost of railway infrastructure includes an eleflBtof &apos;standby capacity&apos;&quot;. We have in fact made intensive enquiries into Theramifications of this subject, and a brief summary of our work is included inAppendix B. We have concluded that, strictly speaking, &quot; standby capacity&quot;other than that required by the railway for commercial reasons or for opera-tional convenience, does not exist as a permanent feature, but there is a consider-able measure of surplus capacity, actual or potential, in the system, the cost ofwhich is bound to swell the Board&apos;s deficit until it can be eliminated. this surplus is not mainly related to the route mileage of the system or to the decisionto retain and develop a basic network of 11,000 route miles. It is almost whollyto be found in the shape of excess track mileage (e.g. four tracks, where twowould suffice to carry the traffic). This is one of the inherited liabilities of therailway which, in the light of the policies which we recommend for the future,should be eliminated as quickly as possible. The amount of the surplus is notstatic and additional surplus should be continuously created with changes inequipment and operational methods. For the purpose of settling this grant,however, it is proposed to confine consideration to surplus which exists now orcan be created before 1974. We hope that it will be possible for the Board to identify and cost all this surplus capacity within the next 18 months. But theyhave explained that, even so, there are good technical reasons why much of this surplus cannot be eliminated as soon as it is identified. In many cases it will involve alterations to alternative routes, the rationalisation of services, the instal-lation of improved signalling and possibly even the removal of old stations orthe building of new ones. Where these steps are necessary they may well takea number of years. But, until they can be carried out, the Board will have tocarry the cost of this surplus. We are therefore satisfied that there is a case,exceptionally, for the Ministry paying a specific grant whose purpose should beto assist, and hasten, the elimination of this surplus and the rationalisation ofthe system. Whether this grant should also cover any part of the capital cost of removing the surplus has still to be considered.2.19 We have already explained why the other historic liabilities under whichthe Board suffer can most conveniently be dealt with by means of a capital reconstruction. The fact that this infrastructure surplus is a liability which canbe substantially reduced over a period of a few years means that, from thefinance angle, the appropriate treatment is a specific but tapering grant, ratherthan capital reconstruction. We are therefore recommending that the Board shouldbe paid, in the first year, a grant which should meet? the assessed cost of this surplus, but that the grant should thereafter be reduced at an agreed rate, sothat it reaches zero at the earliest period by which the Board could be expectedto have removed at least the greater part of this surplus. We suggest that thisperiod should.be fixed at 5 years.2.20 We think we should emphasise that in recommending such a grant, we regard it essentially as a tool for securing the most rapid possible rationalisation of the system. Although the Board gets no benefit from the retention of unneces-sary capacity, we think they would be helped by an incentive to get rid of itrapidly. If a grant is agreed on the lines we propose, it should represent a challenge to the Board to deal with the situation as drastically and as rapidly as circumstances and the available resources permit.2.21 As set out in Appendix B, the Board will not be able to put forward a precise figure for the cost of this surplus until towards the end of 1968. Inthe meantime, they have produced an order of magnitude figure which, for theyear 1969, is a bracket from  11m. to  17m. They believe, and we accept, thatthis may represent something of an underestimate, and we suggest that for thecurrent overall financial exercise we should assume that the grant in 1969 willbe at a rate of  15m. per annum. If this is accepted, then it is fair to assume that by 1974 rationalisation will have reduced their costs by something near tothis amount (even although the grant will no longer be payable), and we have therefore assumed a  15m. improvement in their finance for both years.
Subventions to Operators of Bus Services provided as a Condition of the*Withdrawal of Rail ServicesThese subventions cost the Board  500,000 in 1966. This figure will certainly increase, at least in the short-term. We are still unable to make specific recommendations as to how this financial responsibility can best be removed from the Board, as any new arrangements should fit in with the general structure of the policies for the bus industry generally which are currently being developedwithin the Ministry. But we are agreed that, as part of the overall financialreconstruction which we are recommending, the Board should be released fromthese burdens, and we assume in the following paragraphs that a way will befound to achieve this.The Board&apos;s Future Financial Structure2.23 The Board&apos;s current interest-bearing debt, as set out in their 1966 annual report and Accounts, is as follows:  Interest-Bearing Capital Liabilities to Minister of Transport...Savings Bank Deposits      ...      ...............Superannuation, etc., Deposits and Provisions ...      ...In addition, the suspended debt (on which no interest is payable) totalled ...      .........but the capital deficit arising from adjustment of bookvalues of vested net assets could be offset against thisleaving a total of        ...      ......... 912m.36m.275m.1,223m. 705m.315m.390m.2.24 The following table sets out the likely figures for the Board&apos;s financialposition in 1969 and 1974 including the effect of the proposed grants.Summary of Long-Term Revenue Forecasts1.

At the upper end of the bracket, it is assumed that the Board will be permitted to offset the deterioration in 1967 by increases in&quot;Charges.
2.25 These figures demonstrate that, if the Government policy set out in the&apos;White Paper is to be carried into effect, a considerable write-off of existing capital debt to the Minister is inevitable. The White Paper said that aftert ,. government had assumed responsibility for losses on services retained for socialreasons, the Board should then be given realistic financial objectives to assist them to move as soon as possible to a fully economic basis of operation. Evenon the most optimistic assumptions the Board cannot be expected to do thison the basis of their present debt.2.26 We are agreed that recapitalisation must be on a realistic basis, and mustnot look too far ahead to a period where the uncertainties become great. Werecommend therefore that the capital reconstruction should be carried out on abasis which does not foresee quite such a rate of recovery as is suggested bythe Board&apos;s revenue forecasts, and that the aim should be to put the Board ina position of break-even, including interest payments, in the early 1970s.2.27 We regard it as obvious that the Board must be put in a position wherethey can continue to honour their obligations in respect of the interest-bearingdeposits and provisions for the Savings Banks and Superannuation and RetirementFunds, etc. Any recapitalisation which is considered can relate only to theBoard&apos;s debt to the Minister.2.28 Subject to the figures which the Board produce later in the year not beingdrastically different, we see no reason why it should not be possible to put the- Board in a break-even position by about 1971. Whilst this would certainly involve a drastic writing down of their capital debt, we do not believe that this need go beyond the bounds of acceptability. Transitional deficit grant powersmay well be needed to cover the period from 1969 to 1971, but it is an important part of the scheme which we recommend that no future deficit grant powers need be envisaged for the period after 1971. In other words, we think it essentialthat the Board should be put in a break-even position at an early date, and thatthey should then be seen to be in a similar position to other nationalised industries, with no need for the Minister to have powers to make grants tomeet any deficit that they might incur in an individual year.2.29 It is considered that the capital reconstruction envisaged should be matched by an equivalent writing down of asset values. Such a writing downwould have the consequence of reducing the amount of depreciation which theBoard would have to provide each year, and would thus increase the margin ofrevenue it had available for servicing capital debt. In working out the detailed figures, however, consideration should be given to shortening the depreciationfives of certain assets, for instance because of the risk of technical and commercialobsolescence.2.30 If in any year the Board did in fact fail to earn enough to meet all theirliabilities, including interest, the main effect would be that they would not have earned their depreciation in full. Depreciation (including amortisation) is aprovision in respect of the consumption of fixed assets which involves no cashexpenditure year by year. The expenditure arises only when the assets have tobe replaced. Nonetheless, under the present system, Exchequer grant is issued in respect of the depreciation provision, and the Board are provided with cashin excess of that needed to meet operating losses ; this cash is available towards their current capital requirements. Under our proposed scheme, the board would no longer have the cash from depreciation unless they actually earnedit. They would have to borrow the sum required to make up any deficiency.But given the estimates which the Board and the Ministry make of the positionup to 1974, and on the basis of the degree of recapitalisation which we have inmind, this situation should not present an intolerable burden. We do not thinkthat even over the following few years, it need become unmanageable, though we recognise that there will be a need for a continuing financial improvementafter 1974 if investment is to be sustained at its present level.2.31   There are two further comments which we should make: 2.31.1 We are recommending a very drastic approach to the problem.

Apossible consequences might be that more capital is written off than proves
to have been necessary. If this should prove to be so, the Board might^well earn a considerable surplus. But Section 18 of the 1962 Act alreadyprovides for the establishment of a general reserve as a charge on revenue,under the Ministers control. In addition the Minister will, we suggest, need a power, on the analogy of that contained in Section 3(9) of the air corporations Act, 1966, providing for the capital reconstruction of BO AC,to direct, after consultation with the Board, that any amount surplus to theBoard&apos;s requirements should be paid into the Exchequer.2.31.2 We believe that to put the Board&apos;s financial structure on a break-even basis, and to remove the &quot; safety-net&quot; of a deficit grant power, should re-inforce the Board&apos;s internal financial discipline.2.32 We do not think that it would be right for us to recommend preciselyhow much the write-off should be. We have, as yet, only fairly rough figuresavailable, and the precise figures for recapitalisation will need to be determinedover the next few months in the light of the position that will emerge as theBoard&apos;s own financial forecasts are further refined and, it is hoped, the economicoutlook becomes clearer. Certainly there will be a need for the figures to bediscussed in detail between the Board, the Ministry and the Treasury. But,clearly, the Minister and the Chairman would expect us to recommend theprinciples which any recapitalisation should follow.2.33 As an indication of orders of magnitude, however, we might make thefollowing points:  2.33.1 If the remaining suspended debt were written off, and asset valueswritten down accordingly, the depreciation allowances to be provided inthe Board&apos;s accounts could be reduced by some  15m.- 20m. There wouldbe no immediate effect on the interest burden.2.33.2 If, say,  100m. of the &quot; live &quot; capital debt to the Minister were written off, and asset values were written down correspondingly, the interest burden would be reduced by  6m. per annum and the depreciation provisions couldbe reduced by  5m. per annum.2.34 Recapitalisation on the scale required to meet the recommendations sum-marised in paragraph 2.39 is recognised as a matter of real gravity, andrepresents the acceptance (which is essential) of the fact that British Railways&apos;earnings simply are not sufficient to support the total assets now employed inthe business, even when allowance is made for specific social, etc., grants. Itis thus a step in line with the aims set out in the White Paper on transport policy of July, 1966, (Cmnd. 3057) of providing British Railways with realisticburdens and assets and will enable their efficiency to be judged by normalfinancial criteria.2.35 Nevertheless it is also recognised that recapitalisation is merely an account-ing device to align the book value of British Railways&apos; existing assets with their earnings and of itself does nothing to render British Railways more commerciallyviable in the future when assets will be replaced at the full cost of such assetsat that time. The recapitalisation is, however, recommended in the expectation that it will help British Railways&apos; management to solve the basic problem ofaligning the actual value of their future assets with future earnings, that is,ensure that the quantity and type of assets that are actually replaced in thefuture are only such as can be supported by future earnings.2.36 Moreover, it is not envisaged that the recapitalisation will involve a relaxation of financial discipline; on the contrary it should enable it to beexercised more clearly and thus impose on British Railways a very considerableresponsibility. In the opinion of British Railways this responsibility is made allthe more serious because of the fact that their capitalisation is wholly on thebasis of fixed interest.2.37 The whole of this Section is based on our assumption that, apart from theunremunerative services to be grant-aided on social grounds, the Railways board will have freedom to manage their activities on a commercial basis.Oil
2.38 One member of the Steering Group feels strongly that the present methodof financing the nationalised industries by fixed interest capital is wron^fitleast as regards the railways, and that the introduction of an &quot; equity&quot; v$ffgPabe particularly suitable in the circumstances of that industry. Since, however,we have been informed that the Government would be most unlikely to accept this, we have not pursued the matter further.recommendations.39 In the light of all these considerations we make the following recommendations: - -2.39.1 the capital debt of the Board should be written down to a level atwhich it can reasonably be expected that the interest payments can be foundout of prospective revenue early in the 1970s ;2.39.2 the &quot; break-even &quot; thus envisaged should be based on neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic a forecast of the Board&apos;s revenues in the early1970s ;2.39.3 the capital write-off involved would in part be justified by taking account of the continuing obligations of the Board in respect of railwayroad bridges, level crossings, superannuation, and the Police, as described in paragraph 2.16 ;2.39.4 the capital reconstruction envisaged should be matched by an equivalent writing down of assets values ;2.39.5 appropriate arrangements should be made for dealing with any surplus on revenue account in case, as a result of following the previousrecommendations for cutting down the capital debt, the amount of write-offnecessary has been overestimated ;2.39.6 there should no longer be provision for deficit grants from theMinister (except perhaps for -the transitional period 1969 to 1971): and inparticular, no deficit grant should be payable in respect of depreciationprovision.
Section 3C yfHODS OF CALCULATING, PAYING AND CONTROLLING grants for UNREMUNERATIVE PASSENGER SERVICESIntroduction3.1 We interpret paragraph 25 of the White Paper on Transport Policy of July,1966 (Cmnd. 3057) to mean that a grant ought to be payable wherever theMinister on broad social and economic grounds decides to retain a particularpassenger service, the revenue reasonably attainable from which, falls short ofthe properly attributable costs.3.2 The same White Paper also refers in paragraph 27 to the possibility that local authorities might assume some, at any rate, of the financial responsibilityfor such passenger services. We know that this is under consideration in theMinistry, but for the purposes of this Report we have concentrated on theprinciples and methods to be adopted where the grants are paid by the Ministerof Transport. This does not imply that similar principles should not be adoptedwhere the grants are to be paid by Passenger Transport Authorities or localauthorities.Calculation of Grant, 3.3 We recommend that grants should be based on an assessment of net losseslikely to be incurred over a future period of time, rather than on the basis of payment in arrears in respect of actual losses incurred. We make this recom-mendation because we believe that this will present a considerable inducement to the railways to run their grant-aided services as efficiently as possible so asto reduce actual losses. Furthermore, if grants are paid on an estimated loss,this will considerably reduce the need for audited accounts of each service and,the possibility of dispute about detailed figures. It should also offer an incentive to the Board to reduce losses on the grant-aided services.3.4 We have concluded that once a grant has been agreed in principle, itshould, as far as possible, cover all the costs which the Board incur in respectof that service (including some part of joint costs) and which they are not ableto recover from the receipts from the service.3.5 We recommend that terminal and track and signalling costs incurred onfacilities used only by grant-aided passenger services should be charged to those services.3.6 We refer in paragraph 3 of Appendix E to the further research which isto be undertaken to determine how costs vary with the volume of traffic. Thiswill inevitably be a lengthy process but will help us to see how far, in respectof any of these unremunerative passenger services, there are true &quot; joint costs &quot;,(denned by the Consultants as those associated with the situation where theproduction of one product enables the production of another to take place at no extra cost) (Para. 2 of Appendix E). Costs which vary with outputshould certainly rank for grant. It is arguable that true joint costs should remain the responsibility of the Board but we do not accept this view because it would mean that, in practice, the Board&apos;s remunerative services would haveto carry the full joint costs and thus cross-subsidise the unremunerative.Pending the completion of studies into joint costs and the development of amore precise formula for calculating grants for individual passenger services,we had total figures prepared as a basis for examining the Board&apos;s general financial prospects (Paras. 2.12-2.14). For this purpose all costs were treatedas fully variable and apportioned to the services concerned on the basis used by the Board for passenger profitability studies.3.7 As regards general administration costs, we recommend that it would be appropriate to allocate to the grant-aided services a proportion of those coststhat are properly attributable to passenger traffic.3.8 We recommend that the grant payable should include depreciation, andwe further recommend that this should be assessed on a replacement cost basis,and not on historic costs.   We also recommend that grants should include
an allowance for the appropriate interest charge on the assets used in providingthese unremunerative passenger services.   When  the grant is paid by ministry we recommend that the basis should be a reasonable attribution oactual interest payable by the Board.   This should be subject to furthercussions between the Ministry and the Board.3.9 We agree with the Consultants&apos; recommendation that it would be inappropriate, in calculating grants, to take any account of contributory revenuealthough, in deciding whether a service should be retained, and grant-aided,both the Board and the Ministry will no doubt have to take into account theamount of contributory revenue that may be ait risk. Contributory revenue isthe off-service revenue of journeys partly on and partly off a service.3.10 We regard it as important that the principles to be adopted for the calculation of grants should be consistent with those adopted generally forcosting within the railways, as otherwise any arrangement would be open tomisunderstandings and criticism. It does not follow that the financial accountsshould accord in all respects with the costing formulae ; in particular, deprecia-tion will be charged for accounting purposes on the basis of historic costs.Application for Grant3.11 We recommend that three years should normally be the period for which grants should be fixed in advance. If the period is kept to three years, this willbe long enough to provide an incentive, and short enough for it not normallyto be necessary to include any provision for review of individual cases during that period, though wage inoreases seem to raise special difficulties, as theycan hardly be taken into account in advance, and we discuss this further inparagraph 3.14. If costs other than wages rise above those ruling at the timewhen the grant was fixed, then the Board will have to cope with these, andshould not be able to ask for any increase in grant until the termination of thethree year period, except in the circumstances described in paragraphs 3.15 and3.16. The dates for review of grants for particular services should be staggeredto ease the administrative burden of assessment and review, and in order to setup this arrangement initial grants may have to be paid for shorter periods than three years in a proportion of cases.3.12 Requests for grants should be submitted service by service, by the Board.In each case the Board should submit to the Ministry sufficient details (seeparas. 3-6 of Appendix D) to show that the services are being operatedefficiently and that all means of reducing costs, while providing an adequatestandard of service, have been fully explored. They should also give whateverinformation they have of the demand for those services, and the extent to whichthis demand will be met by the proposed service to enable the Minister todecide, in the light of all other relevant considerations, on the merits of thecase for grant on broad social and economic grounds. Where there is a major traffic reorganisation in contemplation, in conurbations for example,additional information may need to be sought.Control by the Ministry3.13 We recommend that in addition to careful scrutiny of the Board&apos;s sub-missions, the Ministry should select for detailed review a sample from the oasessubmitted to them. This review should not include a check of the calculations,but this would be done in a proportion of cases by an independent accountantwho might be the Board&apos;s auditors.3.14 The Consultants originally recommended that no provision at all shouldbe made for the escalation of costs. But the development of the questionnairedescribed in paragraphs 3-6 of Appendix D has shown that in practice the board will be required to take into account any possible economies in calculating the amount of the deficit to be grant-aided. Accordingly we think some waywill have to be found of helping them to deal with wage increases, which couldrepresent a very substantial increase in costs. We are giving this further thought.3.15 We recognise that for very large services, particularly in conurbations, itmay be necessary to provide for a review if circumstances change significantlyduring the three year period.
3.16 The Minister must have control over the frequency and standard of service,aaijk the maximum fares, on any grant-aided service. The Board should beeHBbd to ask for a review of the grant if there is an increase in the deficit on any service as a direct result of the exercise of the Ministers control.3.17 Furthermore, because any capital investment on such a service will affect the future level of grant, the Board should be required to refer to theMinistry for specific approval any proposed capital expenditure over a statedamount, including any renewals, which is made in respect, or in partial respect,of a grant-aided service. If such a service is withdrawn before the fixed assetshave been fully depreciated, then -the Board will make a capital loss, and wayswill have to be found of meeting this (e.g. by writing off the unexpired balanceagainst capital account). There will be a similar need in cases where expenditureon renewals and periodic maintenance is not fully recovered before a service iswithdrawn.3.18 Grants should be paid by the Ministry to the Board at 4-weekly intervals.These sums should be calculated as being 1/13th part of the annual agreedamount for each service. Where the period fixed for a grant has come to anend, and a decision has not yet been taken by the Ministry as to whether thegrant should be renewed, at the same or any different level, then pendingsuch an agreement the grant should continue to be paid, at the previous level,with any necessary retrospective adjustment when the new grant is agreed.3.19 The Board should be required to give the overall estimated financial results, in respect of grant-aided passenger services, in their Annual Report.The time (that would be required to ascertain these figures would probablymake it impossible to include audited figures in the Accounts.3.20 We think it reasonable that the Ministry should be supplied with figures,at agreed intervals, in respect of each grant-aided service, to show the extentto which the service is being used. These figures would not relate to thefinancial results, but could take the form, for example, of passenger counts.legislation.21 We suggest that as far as possible the legislative provisions should be widely drawn. The essentials are:  3.21.1 that the Minister should have power, in respect of individualunremunerative services:(a) to decide that they should be continued on broad social and economic grounds, %(6) to agree with the Board the level of service to be provided,(c) to decide on the level of grant to be paid for a period of up to threeyears ahead,(d) to call for information about the extent to which such services are infact being used.3.21.2 that the Board, in addition to supplying the details mentioned inparagraph 3.19, should be under an obligation to refer any proposals for major capital expenditure in respect of any such service to the Minister.3.22 All the above recommendations relate to legislative proposals. In themeantime, and as soon as possible, we recommend that calculations on the basisset out in paragraph 3.3 should be carried out, that the Ministry should reach decisions on individual services as though grants were to be paid, and theamounts concerned should be noted in the Annual Reports, in order that theextent to which the Board&apos;s deficit relates to services which, for the future, willbe specifically grant-aided by the Ministry, can be readily seen.3.23 Other aspects of the arrangements for paying grants in respect ofunremunerative passenger services are discussed in Appendix D as explainedearlier in paragraph 1.11.
Section 4BOARD STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATIONPresent Position4.1 Section 1(3) of the Transport Act, 1962 provides that the Board shallconsist of a Chairman, one or two Vice-Chairmen, and not more than sixteennor less than ten other Members. It also provides that Board Members areto be appointed by the Minister from among persons who have had wide experience of, and who have shown capacity in, transport, industrial, commercial,or financial matters, administration, applied science, or the organisation ofworkers. At present, there are a Chairman, two Vice-Chairmen, seven full-time members and four part-time Members. All :the full-time Members, other thanthe Chairman and the newly appointed Vice-Chairman, have functional respon-sibilities.4.2 Section 2 of, and the First Schedule to, the 1962 Act provide for the setting up of six Regional Railway Boards to share between them responsibilityfor all parts of the national railway system. Subsection 2(2) gives the Ministerpower, by order, to vary the number of Boards. Subsection 2(4) provides thatthe Regional, Railway Boards shall exercise such functions of the railways board as are delegated to them by the Board, and the Board have to determinethese functions on lines settled from time to time with the approval of theMinister. At the present time, as a result of an order made by the minister in 1966, there are only five Regional Railway Boards.Method of Work by the Group4.3 We have had the benefit of a statement by the Railways Board in whichthe Board&apos;s own proposals for a new structure and organisation of the railways are set out. The Group also received a separate report from the Consultants,including recommendations based on the experience they had gained over thewhole of the Railways organisation since the beginning of their appointment as Consultants to the Group.4.4 In addition we were fortunate in obtaining the services of the Senior Partnerof the firm of Consultants employed on this assignment who interviewed separatelyeach of the Group members and collated their views in a report to the Group,and in addition provided a separate paper giving an indication of his own views which he had formed in the course of these discussions.4.5 The Group have considered carefully all the views which have been putforward to them in these several reports and our conclusions are set out in thefollowing paragraphs.The Proposed Future Structure and OrganisationFactors AJiecting Overall Structure and Organisation4.6 The British Railways Board control a complex of many businesses. Asin any business it is essential, if profitability is to be ensured, to match productionand sales, but the transport industry has the characteristic that transport cannotbe stored. It is also vital to plan railway services in such a way as to maximiseutilisation of all the assets, including manpower. In many cases, this involvesdecisions about the allocation of resources, when the priorities between different types of service have to be assessed. Furthermore, all such decisions depend,in the long run, on adequate co-ordinated long range planning. It follows there-fore that general management is required at the centre to ensure that all forward planning activities are properly co-ordinated and carried out within the framework of agreed objectives and overall strategies.4.7 On the other hand there is a need for dispersed management. Both thescale of railway operations, and the geographical dispersion of the systemrequire local managements with authority to make decisions on day to daymatters. This local management must operate within general policy lines laiddown by general management at the centre.
4.8   The future management structure requirements of the railways will clearlySfluenced by a number of factors which have already become evident but1 are likely to become more marked in the future. The most importantese are: -4.8.1 the continuing rationalisation of the system by the elimination of facilities (track, marshalling yards, terminals) which are no longer required;4.8.2  the more intensive use of the developed system ;4.8.3   the continuing reduction in the labour force ;4.8.4 the trend towards a more ordered pattern of operation both for passenger and freight services.These will make it even more vital to develop sophisticated planning and controltechniques, including the use of computers, both for day-to-day control and for&quot; model&quot; building.4.9 All these considerations suggest an increasing trend towards the centralisationof the planning of railway operations with at least the main trunk services,passenger and freight, being directed from the centre. This will also be required if the Board are to develop their relationships with the new National and regional Transport Organisations which are to be set up. Strong central financial control will also be required if the Board are to achieve the financial targetswhich we have recommended in Section 2 of this Report. These financial objectives will make it even more important for the Board to ensure that thereare comprehensive plans, covering each main section of their business, for the achievement of these objectives.4.10 At present, the Board&apos;s Headquarters is organised into functional depart-ments headed by Chief Officers who in turn report to Board members. Asindicated above, all the full-time Board members, except for the Chairman andone Vice-Chairman, have functional responsibilities. It is the consensus ofopinion amongst us that full-time members should be without the direct executiveline responsibility that they have under the present arrangements.4.11 Relations between the Board and the Regions may have been complicated by the Regions having a statutory status under the 1962 Act, and by the philosophyof that Act being that the Regions were to have the main responsibility forthe &quot; management of the railways&quot;. We doubt whether a split statutoryresponsibility for the management of the railways, and the present independentstatutory position of the General Managers, can be conducive to ideal relationsbetween the Board and the Regions.Scope of our Recommendations &apos;*4.12 Railway problems are unique, both because of the size and geographicalspread of the industry and the nature of its operations and commercial activities.Many of us are without direct experience of the industry and can only baseour opinions on acquaintanceship with its problems and the limited study thathas been possible over the last year. We are also conscious that the settingup of the National Freight Organisation, and a number of Passenger transport authorities, will obviously influence the shape of management structure appro-priate for the Railways Board. Furthermore, we have pointed out that thereare a number of developments which are leading to a greater element of centraldirection. We could not, therefore, claim to be in a position to make specific recommendations about all the details that will be involved in the new organisa-tion. But we feel confident in putting forward some general principles whichshould be observed in any new organisational structure.Timescale4.13 We think it best to frame our recommendations in the light of the ultimateshape and structure for the industry which we think will be appropriate in afew years time when the &quot; new railway &quot; is in existence. We are, in the following paragraphs, recommending a different type of Board designed to meet thesituation then likely to exist, and this will affect the overall structure and geo-graphical organisation of the railways.   It may well be that none of the changes
which we propose can be implemented quickly. We accordingly emphasise that there will be a need for a transitional period during which these changescan be effected. We accept that the determination of the precise provi/ \larrangements which will operate during this transitional period must be forroeMinistry and the Board. These arrangements will have to take account ofthe inevitable practical and human problems involved. We do not think thatit would be appropriate for us, in this Report, to attempt to deal with thesetransitional problems. We recognise that they will be difficult, but we areconcentrating on what we believe should be the ultimate objectives.Proposals for the New Board4.14 In our view, the Board should as far as possible be free to concentrate on policy questions and in particular on the problems of future planning, andthe individual members should not be tied down by day-to-day responsibilities for specific functions. We are therefore generally agreed that it would besensible that ultimately the Board should consist largely of non-functionalmembers and should be smaller than at present.Top Management and Responsibility for Co-ordinationThe Chairman4.15 We accept the view put forward by the Board that the Chairman mustbe given some relief from his present heavy load of day-to-day responsibility.He inevitably has many commitments of a more general nature, and it is therefore desirable that he should be free from day-to-day matters as much as possiblein order to be able to concentrate on the major issues of policy and to projectthe Board&apos;s image both within the organisation and to the public at large.4.16 Clearly it is the Board itself which will carry the ultimate responsibilityfor policy and direction of the railways and for the overall performance ofthe undertaking. But the Chairman has a particular responsibility for thesematters, not least in his relations with the Minister and with Parliament. Allthe Members of the Board, including those with executive responsibilities towhom we refer in paragraphs 4.18 to 4.28 inclusive and 4.30 below, will regard themselves as responsible to the Board as a whole.4.17 We consider that the Chairman must have time to devote to top levelmanagement planning problems. No doubt, a Chief Officer would be responsiblefor the major personnel planning issues, and we think that, exceptionally, sucha Chief Officer should report direct to the Chairman on questions of managementdevelopment.Need for a &quot; Chief General Manager &quot; for the Railways as a Whole4.18 If the Chairman is to be relieved of his day-to-day responsibilities, andthe Board is to be reconstituted as we suggest above, the great majority of usare of the view that it will ultimately be desirable to have a single person tocontrol and co-ordinate all aspects of the day-to-day running of the railway.Whilst we do not wish to assign a specific title to such a person, we envisagehim as a kind of Chief General Manager, responsible for the railway as awhole, and for convenience we refer to such a person below under this title.4.19 We envisage that the Chief General Manager would provide leadershipand direction to the Regions and/or Divisions, and would be the focus of theBoard&apos;s headquarter functional organisation insofar as it is concerned with current policy making and the efficiency of the business. He would be in aposition to provide the necessary degrees of co-ordination between commercial,operating and technical requirements in respect both of passenger and freight traffic.4.20 The burden on one man would necessarily be extremely heavy. But thegreat majority of us are agreed that, under whatever title, there must be one manwhose responsibility it is to take the ultimate decisions on day-to-day matters-or see that they are taken, and are duly implemented. The emphasis should beon his responsibility for the effectiveness of the organisation, rather than on his
taking personal decisions. Many of us do not think that it would solve theproblem to split this duty between two Vice-Chairmen, as it would tend to meantlfinkin practice, difficulties would have to be resolved by the Chairman. Wetherefore recommend that there should be a single Chief General Manager,recognising that he will need a considerable staff in support to whom he willdelegate on a substantial scale.4.21 The Chief General Manager must have a position of sufficient status and authority within the Board, and publicly, to enable him to do this job. Clearlyhe must be a member of the Board, and it might well be the case that it would normally be appropriate for him to be appointed as a Deputy or Vice-Chairman.But we recognise that circumstances and personalities change from time to time,and we do not think that the legislative provisions for the Board need definehis status on the Board.Planning and finance.22 These are two areas which are so important, and which will have sopervasive an effect on the work of the Railways Board as a whole, that werecommend that it will be essential to appoint members to the Board with specificresponsibilities for these two aspects of the Board&apos;s work.4.23 We recommend that one member should be responsible for the co-ordinationof long range planning in the railways. We suggest that he must have specificresponsibilty for .23.1 ensuring that there are coherent, comprehensive and compatibleobjectives, strategies and long range plans for each main sector of thebusiness, directed towards the achievement of the overall financial objectives of the undertaking;4.23.2 establishing a systematic organisational and procedural framework inwhich all planning activities should be carried out and the results monitored ;and4.23.3 co-ordinating all the long range planning activities in the railwayswherever carried out.4.24 It would be necessary for this member to be supported by a corporateplanning department consisting of people with varying knowledge and experience.4.25 He could also be directly responsible for management organisation planning and probably for an economic and commercial studies department which would include market research. Possibly he could also include technical research anddevelopment within his sphere of interest. ,,4.26 We also recommend that there should be a member appointed with specificresponsibility for finance.   He would have a special responsibility for .26.1   the overall financial policy of the undertaking;4.26.2   the operation of the financial control system ; and4.26.3   the development of management information and control systems.We should however comment that we are due to receive a report from the consultants on their review of budgetary and financial control and managementinformation by the end of July, and we may wish to review the responsibilityfor the development of these systems in the light of that report.4.27 In view of the great importance for finance of purchasing and supplies inthe special circumstances of the railways, we suggest that the finance membermight also be responsible for these activities and it would also be appropriate to consider, in the light of circumstances at the time, whether he might also havean overall responsibility for estates.4.28 It will be essential that both the planning and finance members shouldhave positions of recognised status and responsibility on the Board, to which,of course, as a whole, they would both be responsible. We suggest that thelegislative provision for the Board should be such that it would be open to the
Minister, in consultation with the Chairman, to appoint both of these as ViceChairmen of the Board if, in particular cases, this seemed appropriate. iJHfcismight most conveniently be achieved, by analogy with the Iron and SteeMJPt,1967, by giving the Minister power to appoint one or more members of theBoard as Deputy or Vice-Chairman.Full-Time members .29 In addition there must clearly be a number of full-time Board members.With the sole exception of a member who, we recommend, should have functionalresponsibilities for personnel and labour relations (paragraph 4.30) we are agreedthat these Board members should not have functional duties. They should havespheres of interest, and might often be required to co-ordinate activities ofvarious kinds. By this, we mean that individual members might be givenresponsibility for such varying matters as the overall development of the passengerbusiness (necessarily crossing many functional boundaries), relations with thevarious Passenger Transport Authorities, the general oversight of one or moreRegions, or non-executive Chairmanship of (or general responsibility for) oneor more of the subsidiary units to which we refer in paragraph 4.41 below. the functional head of each of the various departments should be the Chief Officer,reporting to the Board as a whole, (most of them through the Chief general manager), and not, as now, to a functional member of the Board.4.30 In view of the undoubted importance of personnel and labour relations,we think that there should be a Board member who should have specificresponsibility for the longer term development of labour relations in the industry.The Chief General Manager would, of course, be regarded as the employer oflabour on the railways and he should have the support of a Chief Officer todeal with personnel and labour relations matters on a day-to-day basis. Butthere will be a number of important issues which have to be taken to Boardlevel, and it is important that the Chief General Manager should not have to devote a disproportionate amount of time to them. Furthermore, labour relationswill be one of the major responsibilities of the Board as a whole, and they maywell find it important that there should be another one of their number, inaddition to the Chief General Manager, with a special interest in this field.The labour relations member should, however, have a wider remit than theChief Officer, and should not be regarded merely as the functional head of his department.4.31 We do not think that it is possible to lay down any precise number ofBoard members. This will depend on the changing circumstances of the railwayindustry, and the different types of personality on the Board. It also depends upon the extent to which, in practice, the Chief General Manager finds that heneeds assistance, at Board level, in the discharge of his duties for general management over the system as a whole. We suggest that the new legislation should provide for a minimum of three, and a maximum of six, such full-timeBoard members, including the one dealing with labour relations, but in additionto the Chief General Manager and the members with specific responsibilities for planning and finance.Level of Remuneration and other Conditions of Service (including Pensions) for board Members and Chief Officers4.32 We are seriously concerned about the current level of remuneration andother conditions of service for members of the Board, and for Chief Officers.This is so vital a matter that we have concluded that we should make detailedenquiries, and we intend to make recommendations in a subsequent report.In the meantime, this matter is of such importance that it would be wrong forus to make general recommendations about the structure of the new Boardwithout making it plain that, in our view, substantial improvements will berequired in the level of remuneration and in the other conditions of service(including pensions) both for Board Members and for Chief Officers.
Headquarters Staff4.S&amp;Jt will be obvious from the recommendations made above that mostBcUHa members should not have specific functional responsibilities, that a vitalrole will be played by the Chief Officers at Headquarters, who would carry full responsibility as heads of departments. Except for those Chief Officers con-cerned with the planning and finance functions which we suggest should bethe responsibility of the two members described in paragraphs 4.22 to 4.28 above,the Chief Officers would report to the Chief General Manager. This would not,however, prevent the development of close relations with any of the full-time members of the Board who might have accepted a special interest in theirsphere of responsibility.Part-Time members .34 We recommend that there should be at least three part-time members, who should be appointed for their ability and experience rather than on anyrepresentational basis. Specifically the Group do not favour the idea whichwas put to us that there should be representation on the Board of the national coal Board, the British Steel Corporation and the National Freight Organisation.We are satisfied that the necessary co-ordination with those bodies can beachieved in other ways.4.35 We further recommend that the period of service for part-time members&apos; should be restricted. We do not wish to recommend any exact time limit, butsuggest that when the Minister and the Chairman consider individual appoint-ments they should bear in mind that, on the one hand, part-time members should serve for long enough to ensure that the Board get full value from their experience, and the contribution they can make whilst, on the other hand, thereshould be sufficient change in their ranks in order to provide for the necessaryinfusion of new ideas at regular intervals. In this connection we think there willbe considerable advantage in providing for greater flexibility in the remuneration of part-time members than is now customary. We have in mind that theremay be occasions when an eminent outsider, whose services would be of value to the railways, might be prepared to serve on say a half-time basis with a consequential and desirable enhancement of his responsibility compared withthat of a normal part-time member.A General Scheme of Organisation and the Place of the Regions4.36 We have already set out in paragraphs 4.6 to .4.11 the general con-siderations, present and future, which in our view will affect the relationsbetween General Management at the centre, and Regional Management. Wehave also referred in para. 4.12 to the effect on the shape of the Board&apos;smanagement structure of the setting up of the National Freight Organisation and passenger Transport Authorities and to the developments which are leading toa greater element of central direction. All these considerations are consistent with our recommendations for a small non-functional Board, and the appointmentof a Chief General Manager.4.37 We are agreed that the existing statutory Regional Boards no longer fulfilany essential function, and may indeed militate against the effectiveness ofHeadquarter control. Accordingly we recommend that the provision in Section 2of the Transport Act, 1962, relating to the establishment of Regional Boards,should be repealed.4.38 We are impressed by the desirability of affording to the Chairman of theBoard and the Minister the greatest possible degree of flexibility in developing a Board structure and organisation that meets the needs of a situation that is,and is likely to continue to be, fluid. Accordingly we have noted with interest the precedent created by the Iron and Steel Act, 1967, which provides for the submission to the responsible Minister for his approval of a general scheme of organisation for the industry.
Headquarters Staff4JHklt will .be obvious from the recommendations made above that mostBoSHi members should not have specific functional responsibilities, that a vitalrole will be played by the Chief Officers at Headquarters, who would carry full responsibility as heads of departments. Except for those Chief Officers con-cerned with the planning and finance functions which we suggest should bethe responsibility of the two members described in paragraphs 4.22 to 4.28 above,the Chief Officers would report to the Chief General Manager. This would not,however, prevent the development of close relations with any of the full-time members of the Board who might have accepted a special interest in theirsphere of responsibility.Part-Time members .34 We recommend that there should be at least three part-time members, who should be appointed for their ability and experience rather than on anyrepresentational basis. Specifically the Group do not favour the idea whichwas put to us that there should be representation on the Board of the national coal Board, the British Steel Corporation and the National Freight Organisation.We are satisfied that the necessary co-ordination with those bodies can beachieved in other ways.4.35 We further recommend that the period of service for part-time members should be restricted. We do not wish to recommend any exact time limit, butsuggest that when the Minister and the Chairman consider individual appoint-ments they should bear in mind that, on the one hand, part-time members should serve for long enough to ensure that the Board get full value from their experience, and the contribution they can make whilst, on the other hand, thereshould be sufficient change in their ranks in order to provide for the necessaryinfusion of new ideas at regular intervals. In this connection we think there willbe considerable advantage in providing for greater flexibility in the remuneration of part-time members than is now customary. We have in mind that theremay be occasions when an eminent outsider, whose services would be of value to the railways, might be prepared to serve on say a half-time basis with a consequential and desirable enhancement of his responsibility compared withthat of a normal part-time member.A General Scheme of Organisation and the Place of the Regions4.36 We have already set out in paragraphs 4.6 to 4.11 the general con-siderations, present and future, which in our view will affect the relationsbetween General Management at the centre, and Regional Management. Wehave also referred in para. 4.12 to the effect on the shape of the Board&apos;smanagement structure of the setting up of the National Freight Organisation and passenger Transport Authorities and to the developments which are leading toa greater element of central direction. All these considerations are consistent with our recommendations for a small non-functional Board, and the appointmentof a Chief General Manager.4.37 We are agreed that the existing statutory Regional Boards no longer fulfilany essential function, and may indeed militate against the effectiveness ofHeadquarter control. Accordingly we recommend that the provision in Section 2of the Transport Act. 1962, relating to the establishment of Regional Boards,should be repealed.4.38 We are impressed by the desirability of affording to the Chairman of theBoard and the Minister the greatest possible degree of flexibility in developing a Board structure and organisation that meets the needs of a situation that is,and is likely to continue to be, fluid. Accordingly we have noted with interest the precedent created by the Iron and Steel Act, 1967, which provides for the submission to the responsible Minister for his approval of a general scheme of organisation for the industry.
14.39 Our studies so far have led us to believe that it will be necessary in-thefuture for the centre to assume a greater degree of control over activity amany fields. There must be a clear delegation of management responsfBratywithin the limits of specified policy and planning objectives, and it will bedesirable that the chain of command should be reduced in length wherever practicable. But these are detailed matters on which we do not feel qualified to put forward specific views, particularly as their development will necessarily be a lengthy process. We therefore recommend that a provision corresponding to that in the Iron and Steel Act, 1967, should be included in the Transport Billto provide that the Railways Board should submit a general scheme of organisa-tion to the Minister for her approval within a specified period of the date of coming into operation of the Act. We suggest that the Board should be requiredto submit the first of such schemes within an initial period of 12 months. Wethink that it would be desirable for the Minister herself to have a continuingpower to initiate a change, if she thought one to be necessary, in the absenceof proposals by the Board.4.40 In their original submission the Board suggested that top policy co-ordin-ation would be achieved through an Executive Policy Group consisting of theChairman and the two Vice-Chairmen whom they proposed. If, in the event, itis decided to set up such a Group, which we suggest should be particularly concerned with planning, the details would no doubt emerge from the generalscheme of organisation which the Board will be required to put forward to theMinister. We suggest that it would in any case be appropriate that, whatever their ranks on the Board, such a Group should include, in addition to theChairman, the Chief General Manager whom we recommended in paragraphs 5.18 to 4.21, and the planning and finance members whose functions we have described in paragraphs 4.22 to 4.28.The Board&apos;s Ancillary Activities4.41 It will clearly be necessary to consider whether activities such as work-shops, hotels and shipping should be hived off into separate management unitsor companies. We think that it would be inappropriate for us to seek to reachfirm conclusions on this issue in the absence of a clear appreciation of all the relevant factors.Legislation4.42 The legislative provisions consequent upon our recommendations are relatively simple and fall under three heads as follows:  4.42.1 An amendment of Section 1 of the Transport Act, 1962, to providefor the amended size and composition of the new Board, including a provi-sion on the lines of sub-paragraph 1(8) of Part I of the Fourth Schedule tothe Iron and Steel Act, 1967.4.42.2 The repeal of Secton 2 of the Transport Act, 1962, which providesfor the setting up of Regional Boards.4.42.3 A new provision on the lines of that in Section 4 of the Iron andSteel Act, 1967, requiring the Board to put forward a general scheme of organisation for the Ministers approval within a specified period.
SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONSFinance5.1 Our summary of the likely financial position of the Board in 1969, and1974, before allowing for any capital reconstruction, is set out in paragraph 2.24.This table starts with the Board&apos;s financial forecasts, which are set out inAppendix G.2 and which show a break-even position on operating account in1974. These figures take account of the establishment of the National FreightOrganisation, but not of any grants for social passenger services or trackrationalisation. After studying these figures we have concluded that, unless thereare major changes in policies, the likely results in 1974 might well be up to 40m. worse than the Board have forecast; on the other hand, at best, theywould be unlikely to be more than  10m. better (paras. 2.4, 2.9, 2.24 and appendix G.2).5.2 The best estimate, on the available evidence,, is that the &quot; social&quot; grants forunremunerative passenger services, which we recommended in Section 3 of theReport, will not exceed  40m. per annum in 1969, and  35m. per annum in1974, excluding interest in both cases (paras. 2.12-2.14).5.3 The grant for track rationalisation described in paragraph 5.37 below, islikely to be of the order of  15m. per annum in 1969 ; this grant will have reduced to zero by 1974, but by that date the Board should have achievedsavings of about the same order (para. 2.21).5.4 After taking account of these likely grant levels, and after charging interest,we estimate a deficit for the Board in 1974 of between  5m. and  55m. (para.2.24).5.5 On the basis of the above conclusions, we are satisfied that a considerablewrite-off of existing capital debt to the Minister is inevitable if the Board are tobe given realistic financial objectives (para. 2.25).5.6 We recommend that the capital debt of the Board should be written downto a level at which it can reasonably be expected that the interest payments canbe found out of prospective revenue early in the 1970s (paras. 2.26 and 2.39.1).5.7 We recommend that the &quot; break-even &quot; thus envisaged should be based onneither too optimistic nor too pessimistic a forecast of the Board&apos;s revenues inthe early 1970s (para. 2.39.2).5.8 We recommend that the valuation of the assets should also be scaled downto what is represented by the new capital debt (para. 2.29 and 2.39.4).5.9 We recommend that appropriate arrangements should be made for dealingwith any surplus on revenue account in case, as a result of following the previousrecommendations for cutting down the capital debt, the amount of write-offnecessary has been overestimated ; in particular, the Minister should have powerto direct that any surplus, after taking the Board&apos;s requirements into account,is paid into the Exchequer (paras. 2.31.1 and 2.39.5).5.10 We recommend that there should no longer be provision for deficit grants from the Minister (except perhaps for the transitional period 1969 to 1971): andin particular that no deficit grant should be payable in respect of depreciationprovisions (paras. 2.28, 2.30 and 2.39.6).5.11 We recommend that the Board&apos;s other continuing obligations deriving from the past (in respect of road bridges, level crossings, superannuation and thePolice), should be taken into account in the capital reconstruction which werecommend in para. 5.6 above and that there should not be specific and con-tinuing grants (paras. 2.17 and 2.39.3).5.12 We recommend that ways should be found of compensating the board for the cost to them of subventions to operators of bus services provided in place of withdrawn rail services (para. 2.22 and Appendix D.8).
Grants for Unremunerative Passenger services.13 We recommend that grants should be based on an assessment oiT \tlosses likely to be incurred over a future period of time, rather than orBmebasis of payment in arrears in respect of actual losses incurred (para. 3.3).5.14 &quot;We have concluded that once a grant has been agreed in principle, itshould, as far as possible, cover all the costs which the Board incur in respectof that service and which they are not able to recover from the receipts fromthe service (para. 3.4).5.15 We recommend that terminal and track and signalling costs incurred onfacilities used only by grant-aided passenger services should be charged to those services. Pending further research we agree that where more than one service is involved these costs should be apportioned on the basis used by the Board for passenger profitability studies (paras. 3.5 and 3.6).5.16 We recommend that an appropriate proportion of general administrationcosts should be allocated to grant-aided services (para. 3.7).5.17 We recommend that the grant payable should include depreciation assessedon a replacement cost basis. We also recommend that the grants should include an allowance in respect of interest charges on the assets used in providing theservice (para. 3.8).5.18 We recommend that three years should normally be the period for which grants should be fixed in advance (para. 3.11).5.19 The Minister should have control over the frequency and standard ofservice, and the maximum fares, on any grant-aided service (para. 3.16).5.20 The Board should be required to refer to the Minister for specific approvalany proposed capital expenditure over a stated amount in respect of a grant-aided service. The Board should be compensated where a grant-aided service iswithdrawn before the fixed assets have been fully depreciated or where expendi-ture on renewals and periodic maintenance has not been fully recovered (para.3.17).5.21 The Board should be required to give the overall estimated financial results in respect of grant-aided passenger services in their Annual Report(para. 3.19).5.22 The Ministry should be supplied with figures at agreed intervals in respectof each grant-aided service to show the extent to which the service is being used(para. 3.20).Structure and Organisation5.23 We conclude that the setting up of new national and regional transportorganisations, and technical developments within the railways, will all influence the shape of the central structure of the Board, and the relationship betweenthe centre and the Regions. Against this background we have tried to foreseethe management structure which would be appropriate in a few years time, while recognising that there will be a transitional period during which different arrange-ments may be needed: on these we make no SDecific recommendations (paras.4.12 and 4.13).5.24 Our general conclusion is that the Board should as far as possible be free to concentrate on policy questions and in particular on the problems of future planning, and the individual members should not be tied down by day-to-day responsibilities for specific functions. We therefore recommendthat ultimately the Board should consist largely of non-functional members,and should be smaller than at present (paras. 4.14 and 4.29).Chairman5.25 We. recommend that the Chairman of the Board should be relieved of day-to-day responsibilities, in order to be able to concentrate on the major issues of policy and to project the Board&apos;s image both within the organisation and tothe public at large (para. 4.15).
&quot; Chief General Manager &quot;5,j6tkJVe recommend that a single member of the Board should be responsiblefoV^mtrolling and co-ordinating all aspects of the day-to-day running of therailways. He is envisaged as a &quot; Chief General Manager &quot; whom it might be appropriate to appoint as a Deputy or Vice-Chairman. He would co-ordinatecommercial, operating and technical requirements in respect of both passenger and freight traffic (paras. 4.18-4.21).Planning5.27 We recommend that one member of the Board, who might be a Vice-Chairman, should have specific responsibility for the co-ordination of long rangeplanning in the railways (paras. 4.23 and 4.28).Finance5.28 We recommend that another member, who might also be a Vice-Chairman,should have specific responsibility for financial policy (paras. 4.26 and 4.28).Labour relations.29 We recommend that one member of the Board should have specificresponsibility for the longer-term development of labour relations (para. 4.30).Full-time members.30 We recommend that in addition to the &quot; Chief General Manager&quot;, andthe members with responsibilities for planning, finance and labour relations,there should be provision for a minimum of two, and a maximum of five otherfull-time Board members (para. 4.31).Part-Time members.31 We recommend that there should be at least three part-time members,who should be appointed for their ability and experience rather than on anyrepresentational basis (para. 4.34).Period of Service of Part-Time members.32 We recommend that the period of service of part-time members shouldbe restricted (para. 4.35).Remuneration, Etc., of Board Members and of Chief officers.33 We are confident that substantial improvements will be required in thelevel of remuneration and in other conditions of service (including pensions), both for Board members, and for Chief Officers, and we propose to make recom-mendations in a later report. There should be greater flexibility in the remuneration of part-time members than is now customary (paras. 4.32 and4.35).Regional Boards5.34 We recommend that the statutory provisions relating to the establishmentof Regional Boards should be repealed (para. 4.37).The General Scheme of Organisation5.35 We recommend that the Railways Board should be required to submit a general scheme of organisation to the Minister for her approval within a specific period (say 12 months) of the coming into operation of the Act. TheMinister should have a continuing power to initiate changes, if she thinks theyare necessary (para. 4.39).Trade Union Views5.36 We have taken account in the above recommendations of the views whichthe Trade Unions expressed to us on matters of finance and general Boardstructure ; their views on other subjects are set out in Appendix A, but their comments have not led us to make any specific recommendations on those ofthe matters to which they referred which are within our terms of reference(para. 1.13 and Appendix A).

&quot; Standby &quot; and &quot; Surplus &quot; Infrastructure Capacity5.37 After a detailed investigation we have concluded that it is highly unflfcythat &quot; standby capacity &quot; additional to that required for the railways&apos; comnSWaland social services could be proved to exist as a permanent element of anyforeseeable railway network. There definitely is surplus capacity in the system,however, and We recommend that, for the reasons set out at length in paras.2.18 to 2.21, it would be right to pay a grant to the Board, fixed in advance and on a tapering basis, to assist in the elimination of this surplus and the rationalisation of the system (paras. 1.14, 2.18-2.21 and Appendix B).Other Obligations Deriving From the PastRoad Bridges and Level Crossings5.38 We have concluded that, although there is a good case in equity for transferring road bridges over the railway to local or highway authorities, onthe basis that they should be regarded as part of the highway, the case in lawis less good, and the practical difficulties are too large to be ignored. Wetherefore recommend that ownership of the bridges should remain with theBoard, but that account should be taken of the costs of their maintenance, which amount to about  lim. per annum, in the capital reconstruction which werecommend (paras. 2.16-2.17 and Appendix C.3-C.5).5.39   We also recommend in Appendix C.65.39.1 that the Board&apos;s present payment of  40,000 per annum in respectof trunk road bridges should be discontinued ;5.39.2 that the Board&apos;s present responsibility for the surfaces of all overlinebridges should be borne by the appropriate local authority ;5.39.3 that the Board&apos;s present duties in respect of the maintenance ofbridges should be brought up-to-date ; and5.39.4 that the powers of the Inspecting Officers of Railways in relationto railway bridges already owned by local authorities should be extended.Level Crossings5.40 We conclude that the method of crossing operation, and the fact that control must remain with the railways, make it impossible to seek any finan-cial contribution from local authorities. We recommend that it would be right,to relieve the Board of a figure of the order of  lm. per annum, and thatthis should be done through the medium of the proposed capital recon-struction (paras. 2.16-2.17 and Appendix C.7-C.8).Pensions5.41 We conclude that there is no case for making any specific grant to theBoard in respect of their pension obligations. The total amount of the obliga-tions which result from the decisions of their predecessors is about  5m. perannum, and We recommend that this should be taken into account in theproposed capital reconstruction (paras. 2.15-2.17, para. 2.27 and AppendixC.9-C.15).Museums and Historical Records5.42 We recommend that responsibility for the Board&apos;s museums at Claphamand York should be transferred to the Department of Education and Science,who would be responsible for running a single museum to be housed in a build-ing which the Board would provide at York out of the proceeds of the sale oftheir existing museum properties (Appendix C.16).5.43 We recommend that the historical records should also be transferredto the Department of Education and Science, and housed in the same building at York (Appendix C.17).5.44 We consider that the Railways Board should open negotiations for thetransfer of responsibility for their Museum at Swindon to the Swindon Cor-poration (Appendix C.16).
Railways Savings Banks5Mfcl We recommend that account should be taken of the interest burdenofWnese Savings Bank deposits in the capital reconstruction which we recom-mend (paras. 2.15, 2.27 and Appendix C.18).Transport Police5.46 We have concluded that there is a case for some public contribution towards these costs, to the extent of about  600,000 per annum, and We recom-mend that this should be taken into account in the proposed capital recon-struction (paras. 2.16-2.17 and Appendix C.24-C.31).Costing of Unremunerative Passenger services.47 We recommend that the costing basis used for the calculation of grants for these services from Passenger Transport Authorities should be the same asthat adopted for the calculation of grants to be paid by the Minister (AppendixD.9).legislation.48  Legislative provisions will be needed as follows:  5.48.1. An amendment of Section 1 of the Transport Act, 1962, to pro-vide for the amended size and composition of the new Board, including a provision giving the Minister a power to appoint one or more membersof the Board as Deputy or Vice-Chairman.5.48.2. The repeal of Section 2 of the Transport Act, 1962, providing forthe setting up of Regional Boards.5.48.3. A provision requiring the Board to put forward a general schemeof organisation for the Minister^ approval within a specified period.5.48.4.  Provisions to give effect to our financial recommendations.5.48.5. Provisions to give effect to our recommendations on bridges overrailways and museums and historical records.Appreciaton5.49 Although we shall be submitting one or more further reports to you later in the year, the completion of this report provides an appropriate opportunityfor us to express our thanks for the assistance we have received from our two Joint Executive Directors, Mr. Hammond and Mr. Lazarus, and fromthe Secretariat. A very heavy burden of work has fallen on their shoulders,not only in the drafting and circulation of the numerous papers and minutesof our meetings but particularly in the preparation of this report. They haveperformed their tasks to our entire satisfaction and we are most grateful tothem.Signed on behalf of theJoint Steering Group,John Morris,Chairman.D. E. Barlow,Secretary.July, 1967.
VIEWS OF THE RAILWAY TRADE UNIONS ON MATTERS OTHEjTHAN FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT STRUCTUREA.1 It was clearly desirable that we should have Union views on a numberof matters, and we have now had written evidence from all three Railway Unions,and have held a separate meeting with representatives from each Union. Wehave had views from each Union both on finance and on management structure,and have taken account of them in the recommendations which we make in sections 2 and 4 of the main part of this Report. There are a number ofother matters on which the Unions have put views to us which we think theMinister and the Chairman would wish us to report, and these are set out inthe succeeding paragraphs.ClosuresA.2 All three Unions were in favour of a halt to further closures pending the determination of future policy. ASLEF thought that closure of lines andwithdrawal of services should be halted pending the establishment of &quot; a sound and rational basis for costing&quot;. They thought that joint consultation should play a greater part in the consideration of closures, and that the value of feederlines to the main line services should receive greater emphasis. The NURstressed the importance of correct costing of closures, and thought that the subsidies to bus operators which the railways are required to pay as a conditionof closure should be taken into account. TSSA pointed out the harm done to the railway image by continual closures, and the need to consider whetherbranch lines could not be saved by the kind of cost-cutting exercises nowbeing carried out in East Anglia.A.3   We explained to the Unions that in fact:  A.3.1 The Consultants have said that the Board&apos;s present costing principlesare generally sound,A.3.2  there is no evidence that the elimination of branch lines has deprivedthe railways of an appreciable amount of profitable traffic, andA.3.3   passenger closures since the spring of 1963 are saving about  17m.per year.A.4 ASLEF suggested that restricting the level of service on unremunerativelines was harmful to the image of the railways.A. 5 The NUR thought that there was a case for a contribution by localauthorities towards the cost of providing railway services, because the value,for example, of houses in areas served by the railways is enhanced by improvedrailway services. We have been informed of the development of the policy outlined in paragraph 27 of the White Paper on Transport Policy of July, 1966(Cmnd. 3057) for part of the responsibility for the retention of passenger services to be devolved on to local communities. We do not think that this is a matter on which we could usefully comment further. We have, however, said inSection 2 of this Report that, whilst further thought needs to be given to themeans of meeting the cost of replacement bus services, we are of the definiteview that the Board should no longer be required to do so once the new financeprovisions apply (see also paragraph 8 of Appendix D).A.6 The Ministry representatives agreed at the meeting with ASLEF thatthe Ministry would consider how they could take account of major points raisedby the Unions about individual closures.Road/Rail Track CostsA, 7 ASLEF stressed that road/rail competition should be rationalised, withparticular reference to railway track costs. The Ministry representatives have provided us with a summary of the previous arguments on this issue, and at our meeting with ASLEF they put forward the view that overall the total cost of theroad system (including various ancillary costs such as those of accidents) was heavily outweighed by the total licence duty and fuel tax derived from all road
users. The Ministry also explained that they did not think that the case forgtaurg that heavy goods vehicles and buses did not make an adequate contributionV^^been proved. We know that this is a matter which is very much underconsideration in the Ministry, and do not think that it would be appropriate forus to make any further comment on the issues involved.A.8 We have, however, recommended in Section 2 of this Report that specificaccount should be taken of the costs of railway-owned over line road bridges inthe capital reconstruction of the Board.Control of Withdrawals of Freight Services and Closures of Freight StationsA.9 ASLEF recommended that these should be made subject to the controlof the Minister, because of their importance for the overall transport policies which the Minister was now working out. At our meeting with ASLEF, theBoard pointed out that their policy of freight concentration, and the use of linertrains, had in fact meant that more freight traffic was being carried on certain services. At the same time, the railways recognised that there were other freighttraffics which would be declining.A. 10 We do not think that the case has been proved that closer ministerial control over withdrawal of freight services and closure of freight stations would serve any useful purpose, and we have decided not to make any specific recom-mendations. We explain in Appendices B and D to this Report that the ministry and the Board are jointly pursuing certain questions relating to the allocation of track costs for freight services, and their implications for the control of thewithdrawal of freight services, which arise from the Group&apos;s work on the prob-lems of surplus infrastructure capacity.  1Joint ConsultationsA. 11 This is one of the subjects being considered under the auspices of theMinister of Labour, and is not within the terms of reference given to us. Weconfine ourselves, therefore, to reporting that in the evidence given to us therewas general stress on the need for improving the way in which the machineryfor joint consultation was used. ASLEF said that whilst certain modificationswere necessary, they thought that the present system was right. But harm hadbeen done by this machinery being used for consideration of closure cases.TSSA took the same view that only minor modifications were necessary. But itwas recognised that recent changes, and the number of closures, had throwna great strain on the system. None of the Unions suggested to us that anysubstantial modifications would be necessary.Staff Participation in ManagementA. 12 TSSA thought that there should be more consultation with the staff, butthat it would be wrong for the Unions to have any share in management deci-sions. There should be members with Trade Union experience on the Board,because of the individual contribution they could make, but there should notbe direct Trade Union or staff representation on the Board.A. 13 This is a matter which is currently being considered by the Governmentin relation to all the nationalised industries and we do not think that we arerequired to comment on the views put to us. But we should explain that inlooking at the overall problem of the Board&apos;s management structure we have concentrated on the shape and size of the Board, and have not thought it neces-sary for us to recommend how Trade Union representation should be dealt with.This seems to be mainly a question for the Minister when she comes to makeappointments to the new Board.The Necessity for Adequate Public services a.14 In their evidence the NUR pointed out the importance of clean and com-comfortable trains, a conveniently timed service, speedy services, courtesy and assist-ance from the staff, comfortable station facilities and punctuality of trains. Thesemust be provided at an economic price. They also thought that further elec-trification was important. TSSA thought that a unified fare structure and wellprepared timetables were important. They also stressed the need for the removalof derelict station buildings.029
A.15 These all seem to be matters which properly lie within the managementresponsibility of the Board, and we would not wish to comment, except to Jfjflphasise that, as set out generally in our recommendations in Section 2, and ik^Jfrom the unremunerative passenger services, which are to be grant-aided on broad social and economic grounds, the need for the future will be for the board to plan to provide services which are attractive to the public and which can be run at a profit.Need for a Separate Police force (a). 16 The NUR thought that the present Transport Police tended to act onbehalf of the railway management in matters concerning individual railwaymen,and that there would be advantages in the Police being independent of theRailways Board.A. 17 This is not a question which we have been able to consider in any detail,but it seems to emerge from the work done by the Joint Team that there arevery strong reasons why the existing Railway Police should be maintained. Theviews of the NUR on what is essentially a narrow aspect of the police functionsdo not, in our view, go near to outweighing the arguments in favour of the forcebeing continued.Advantages of ElectrificationA. 18 As already stated the NUR regard this as important in order to providea good standard of service for the public. TSSA thought it important for thegood image of the railways.A. 19 No separate comment is necessary, other than to refer to the variousplaces in this Report in which we have stressed the need for forward planning inorder to ensure that, for the future, investment in major capital schemes is onlyapproved in cases where the Board and the Minister are satisfied on the financialreturn to be obtained from the investment.Need to Improve Career ProspectsA.20 TSSA referred to the importance of career prospects, and thought this could be achieved by improvement of the quality and conditions of work. their main aim was that the best man possible should be acquired for a particularpost, but so far as practicable the expertise already available within the industry should be fully utilised. Whilst recognising the need for movement between thevarious sectors of the nationalised transport industry, they were in principleagainst senior managers being recruited from outside industry.A.21 At the meeting with TSSA, the Board representatives pointed out the needfor injecting new blood into the railways from time to time, not least for training purposes. We accept the need for selecting the best available people for the topmanagerial posts, and clearly this cannot always be done by picking people alreadywithin the railway industry. But it is important, not least for the purpose of raising morale, that it should continue to be seen by all those within the industry that there is no bar to the promotion of able railwaymen to top posts.Retention and Strengthening of the Financial Management services a.22 TSSA thought it important that this central service should be maintained and strengthened, and that even when the NFO came into existence, there shouldbe no attempt to split this central service. This was particularly important inthe light of the greater use and complexity of computers.A.23 We have included recommendations in Section 4 of this Report for thecontrol of the central finance services. The Consultants are due to report tous in the near future on management information and financial control, and we hope to put forward detailed recommendations in the autumn. We would expect that the administrative arrangements eventually agreed for the NFO would allowappropriate co-ordination in this field.

SummaryB.1 The concept of &quot; standby capacity &quot; was specifically included in our termsof reference, and we set up a Special Cornmittee to study it in detail. We decidedat an early stage that we were concerned with standby capacity in infrastructure(i.e. formation, track and signalling, etc.) and not with any standby in terminals,depots or wagons and carriages. We were also agreed that the real question was how far, if at all, would the proposed future railway network, as broadlyagreed between the Minister and the Chairman of the Board, contain standbycapacity which was additional to that standby capacity required (a) on com-mercial grounds, and (b) for the social services. In other words, and this seemedto the Group a most important point to emphasise, we were looking for surplus which was additional to that which the railways would need for sound com-mercial reasons (e.g. to cope with predictable peaks or to assist operational efficiency). We were also aiming to identify the nature of such surplus, why itexisted, and, if any part of it was likely to persist, the reasons why.B.2 In the fight of detailed investigations carried out on their behalf, the Com-mittee finally agreed that it was highly unlikely that standby capacity as set out above (i.e. additional to that required for commercial and social services), couldbe proved to exist as a permanent element of any foreseeable railway network.We accept this view.B.3 The Committee were agreed, however, that there definitely was considerablesurplus capacity in the system, the cost of which the Board would be unable tobear unaided if the continuance of the deficit was to be avoided. The essentialdistinction is that standby capacity would have permanence: surplus is essentiallytemporary and capable of removal. This surplus was mainly a matter of excesstrack capacity, and was related only to a minor extent to excess route mileage.In other words, it was more relevant to look at the width of the individualroutes within the system, rather than at its total length.B.4 As described in detail in paragraphs B.12 to B.14 below, we accepted theCommittee&apos;s recommendation that a programme of work should be settled to identify this surplus, so that its cost could be assessed, and a programme couldsubsequently be agreed for its elimination.Work of the Standby Capacity CommitteeSurplus in the System as a WholeB.5 An initial approach adopted by the Committee was to assume that standbycapacity was maintained by the railways in the form of a number of routeswhich were additional to those which would be provided by a fully commercialsystem. Thus it was thought that the difference between the 8,000 miles ofroute which would have been likely to result from the approach contained inthe Board&apos;s report, &quot; The Development of the Major Railway Trunk Routes&quot;,published in 1965, and the 11,000 mile system subsequently agreed between theMinistry and the Railways,* might disclose a quantifiable amount of standbycapacity. Consideration of these 3,000 miles of route and of the routes on theremaining 8,000 miles, disclosed that the Committee should be looking at routecapacity rather than route miles as such.Examination of Specific RoutesB.6 The Board suggested that it might be helpful for the Committee if specialstudies were made of a number of individual routes of widely varyingcharacteristics. Three such studies were made by a Ministry economist working on data provided by the British Railways Board.* Published in March, 1967 as &quot; The Railway Network for Development &quot;.STANDBY&quot; AND &quot; SURPLUS &quot; INFRASTRUCTURE CAP ACT
B.6.1 The first route studied was the East Coast main line from King&apos;s^jCross to Doncaster. The study identified some surplus capacity, whichflBtould permit the running of an additional 36 express passenger trains, or18 slow freight trains per day. Its cause was the need to have a signallingsystem which would pass express passenger trains at very frequent intervalsduring peak periods. In consequence, capacity was available for the restof the day, but it had not so far been possible to sell this capacity to users.It was implicit that the net revenue from peak passenger services adequatelycovered the cost of providing this surplus capacity.B.6.2 The next route studied, Plymouth to Penzance, was a &quot; secondary &quot;route on which the long term decline in summer holiday traffic had renderedsome of the track capacity superfluous to present requirements. It was found, however, that the regional management has plans for completelyrevised train services on the route, with a consequent reduction of the trackmileage, and an increase in track utilisation. The route, which is at presentnearly all of double track, is proposed for reduction to mainly single trackwith appropriate passing loops. The resulting train and track capacity isconsidered adequate for present and future needs. This was a case wheresurplus capacity had been identified, but by re-arranging and reducing the train services, it would be possible to eliminate nearly all of the surplus capacity. Some investment would be required for the singling project, butthe potential savings were very high in comparison with the investmentrequired.B.6.3 Finally, a study was made of the Weaver Junction to Glasgowroute, as it would be after electrification. This is a route on which therailways would have almost complete freedom to adjust the capacity to suit future commercial and operating requirements. Even with this freedom,it was proposed to install surplus capacity, so that the day-long rate ofutilisation would be only just over 60 per cent. As with the East Coastmain line, this high level of capacity was caused by the need to signal the route to carry short-run peaks of traffic at certain times of the day. as these would in themselves be profitable traffics, even including the cost ofthe extra capacity they required, it was concluded that the existence of thesurplus capacity on the route would not impose a financial handicap uponthe railways.B.7 It was implicit in these three reports that it is possible to tailor the infra-structure capacity of a route to the expected volume and mix of traffic at least in the long term. Any surplus is, therefore, almost entirely a matter of com-mercial choice (e.g. to cope with profitable peaks) or of history. There may wellbe circumstances in which it is cheaper to leave the surplus, at any rate for atime, than to incur the expenditure required to eliminate it.Distinction between Standby and SurplusB.8 The Committee finally agreed, and we accept, that there is certainly surplus capacity in the existing network, and this creates a financial problem since, as theBoard have consistently maintained, to leave the whole responsibility with them will merely ensure the continuance of the deficit. The Committee therefore came to the conclusion that the best way forward was to try to agree about the size and cost of this surplus infrastructure capacity, to decide how long it wouldtake to eliminate it, and then to agree on a method of payment which wouldprovide an incentive to the Board to get ricl of this surplus as soon as possible.The Committee agreed that, given time, there should be no difficulty in calcu-lating the extent of the surplus, though they recognised that it might vary overtime in the light of changed traffic levels.Proposals for Identification of Surplus CapacityB.9 The Committee agreed that the extent of surplus infrastructure would depend on the number and types of trains to be run. It could not, therefore,be divorced from operating and commercial considerations. Only the board would be in a position to identify this surplus infrastructure in the light of the033

It could not, therefore,be divorced from operating and commercial considerations. Only the board would be in a position to identify this surplus infrastructure in the light of the033
profitability of the traffics concerned.   Most of it would probably be found to beon the &quot; secondary&quot; system, but some would be on the &quot; primary&quot; systen^Most of it, also, would be in the form of double or multiple track, some&amp;Wiwhich could be reduced, thus lowering maintenance costs without reducing Wroute mileage.B.10 On lines used only by grant-aided passenger services, the Committeeassumed that the full cost of the minimum necessary track capacity for these services would qualify for the social grant. Any existing capacity in excess ofthe minimum requirements should be identified separately and included in the calculation of surplus capacity, with plans for its elimination.B.11 Special problems arose in the identification of surplus capacity and theallocation of costs for grant purposes on lines carrying freight as well, asgrant-aided passenger services, and also on &quot; freight only&quot; lines. The alloca-tion of track costs, where a line is shared between freight and passenger services,is a difficult question, and it may not always be right to accept the recom-mendation in the original report from the Consultants on Costing principles,which advocated a continuance of the railways&apos; present practice of calculatingthis on the basis of total train weights. As set out in Appendix D, we arehoping to be in a position to make firm recommendations about this later inthe year.RecommendationsB.12 The Committee therefore recommended that the following plan of action should be taken by the Board : B.12.1   they should identify all existing surplus capacity whether on the secondary or primary system ;B.12.2 they should identify those lines on the secondary system whichwould be needed for social passenger services, but on which, whilst theyare so used, the Board would also run freight services. In respect of these,the Board should consider whether the freight services were likely to requireadditional infrastructure and whether they could meet its cost;B.12.3 they should estimate the cost of the continuing maintenance ofeach element of surplus capacity and the capital cost (if any) of itselimination;B.12.4 they should prepare a programme for the elimination of surplus capacity (taking into account the commitment to an 11,000 mile system),B.13 A capital investment programme should then be agreed with the ministry for the elimination of the surplus. A grant should also be agreed, on a diminishing basis, which would, in the first year, pay for the actual cost ofmaintaining this surplus. The grant would be paid annually at a level whichwould be fixed in advance, and which would be reduced year by year at a rate which assumed that the agreed elimination programme could be maintained. Theeffect of this should be that the Board would be relieved of all the costs oftheir non-commercial surplus infrastructure provided that they succeeded incutting it out as quickly as the programme envisaged. The Board would thenbe left with a network which, after taking account of the social grants, shouldbe able to play its part on a commercial basis in the country&apos;s transport system.It would be a much slimmer network than at present but it would retain the margin needed for commercial reasons, and the Committee did not believethat any additional surplus capacity need, or should, be maintained.Implementation of the Committee s RecommendationsB.14 We accepted all these recommendations, and decided to set up a furtherCommittee to assist the Board in the formulation of their detailed proposalsfor the identification and costing of surplus infrastructure and the preliminaryassessment of its cost. The remaining paragraphs in this Appendix describe theprogress that has so far been made with this work.B.15  There are three separate stages involved : B.15.1 The preparation of the broad estimate, which we have included inSection 2 of this Report.
OB.15.2   Further work designed to produce, by the autumn, a more reliableestimate.B.15.3   The preparation over the next 18 months of a detailed assessment of surplus, line by line, ;the calculation of its cost and the preparation ofa plan for its elimination over a stated period.Preparation of a Detailed Assessment of Surplus, and its costDefinition of SurplusB.16 It is assumed that it will be necessary to maintain and provide servicesover a specific route mileage determined by the Network for Development,published in March, 1967. In that context surplus track and signalling capacitycan be defined as that which can be eliminated at no cost, or at a cost whichwill show a reasonable return on any necessary investment, and yet still leavesufficient capacity to operate such services as are commercially desirable andthose services which the Minister decides should be retained on broad social and economic grounds.Establishment of SurplusB.17 To establish the extent of this surplus, a critical examination must bemade of the need for all track and signalling comprising the 11,000 route milenetwork in relation to the traffic likely to be available on a commercial basis and for social needs, as well as the methods by which this traffic will be moved.B.18 We assume that the proposed Bill will become law during 1968, andthat the Government will decide to commence the payment of grants in respectof this surplus from 1st January, 1969. We refer, in future, to this date as the&quot; prescribed date&quot;. We think it is a reasonable assumption that it will be feasible for the Board, before the prescribed date, to produce a sufficientlyaccurate assessment of surplus, and its cost, on which the total amount of grantcan be calculated.B.19 The Board have made it clear that, so far as commercially desirabletraffics are concerned, account must be taken of the precepts contained in thereport on the Development of the Railway Trunk Routes (February, 1965), forthe concentration of the maximum volume of through traffic over the minimum of routes to reduce the cost per unit carried.B.20 Even the best estimate of surplus capacity, however, can be no morethan an approximation of a theoretical position which could exist at somepoint in time. It can never truly reflect the actual position on the track aschanges in train speeds, speed mix, and methods of operation will take placecontinually to improve efficiency and productivity; the demand for rail transport will also change, and these factors will vary the actual degree of surplus capacity.It will be necessary before the &quot; prescribed date&quot; to make an assessment of surplus as it will be likely to exist on that date, or ,to be created over the period during which grants will be payable (see paragraph B.21 below). We assume that this will be five years, and we refer henceforward to this five year period,ending on 1st January, 1974, as the &quot; prescribed period&quot;. This assessmentwill be required for the purpose of calculating the size of the grant. But we recognise that this is necessarily a somewhat artificial picture, and that inpractice the Board will need to review the extent of any surplus capacity as a continuing process.B.21 We are agreed that the Board will be required to assess not only thecurrent surplus at the prescribed date, but also that surplus which will be created by the changes in the levels of traffic, and changes in operating methods and signalling over the next few years and which, at least as to the major part,they expect to be able to eliminate over that period. For this purpose theBoard will estimate the likely pattern of operations by the end of the prescribed period in 1974, and use this estimate as the basis for their calculations. Theywill also include all surplus which is currently in existence at the time that each individual line is surveyed. A record will be kept of all surplus removed priorto the prescribed date, and the grant will cover the balance of surplus remaining.
B.22 The Board have made it plain that while they accept their obligation toreduce track and signalling facilities to a minimum commensurate wittaHJfjjeservices to be provided, the identification of surplus and its removal cSfflBtcoincide in time. To achieve the necessary reductions it will be necessaryin many cases to resignal, to install track circuits and automatic level crossingbarriers, to re-lay and re-align track and eliminate points and crossings. Thereis a limit to the physical resources available for this work in design offices, incontracting firms, in railway works and on the track itself, and the Boardregard it as unrealistic to suppose that resources can be concentrated to eliminatesurplus capacity from the network at a very rapid pace. The most convenienttime at which to simplify a railway layout is when re-laying of the track becomes necessary or when signalling assets have reached the end of their useful life andmust be replaced. But there may be economic and financial reasons why earlierchange is necessary.B.23 A decision about the priority to be given to the work involved ineliminating surplus will have to be reached by the Ministry and the Boarddirect when the full assessment of surplus has been completed, and when it ispossible to compare the results from expenditure on the elimination of surplusagainst the expected return on investment for the development of the mainroutes and facilities. The Board set a high value on the use of the available resources for modernising and developing main routes to improve efficiency sothat the best service can be given to the greatest number of the population and the largest sectors of industry. They believe that, in terms of cash con-tribution to viability, with the limited physical resources available, investment in track and signalling on a trunk route, associated with electrification, shouldachieve more and produce a much better net return to the railways than invest-ment in the engineering work required for the elimination of surplus. Butthey recognise that it will be necessary to review the priorities when the detailed assessment of surplus is available, and we agree that this assessment should beproduced as quickly as possible. When it is available, the Board and the ministry will have to explore alternative policies and estimate their effect.Grant for SurplusB.24 When the surplus has been identified by the methods described above,and to the extent that elimination will not have taken place by the prescribeddate, the amount of the grant for surplus infrastructure to be paid initially (i.e.in 1969) will be based on: -B.24.1   the annual cost of the maintenance of track and signalling installa-tions ; and b.24.2   signalling operation costs,for those facilities which are already surplus on the prescribed date, or which theBoard estimate will become surplus during the prescribed period. Pendingsettlement of the new capital structure for the railways it will not be possible todetermine the future interest and depreciation element in the cost of surplus.For the time being, therefore, in the assessment of the cost of surplus, interestand amortisation as it would be in present conditions, should be shown separately.Method of Calculation for different categories of lineB.25 The Board have informed us of the methods which they propose to adoptfor the identification of surplus and the assessment of its cost and have explainedthat for this purpose it will be essential to divide the rail network into severaldifferent categories related to its use and the type of service operated. Weendorse their method of approach.Assumptions Used for the Estimate of the Order of Magnitude FigureB.26 We have explained in paragraph B.18 that we think it is a reasonableassumption that the detailed assessment can be substantially completed by 1stJanuary, 1969. But it clearly cannot be done in any shorter period. In orderto produce an order of magnitude figure, short cut methods had to be employed,and we accept the Committee&apos;s view that these methods are acceptable within thetime constraint.
B.27   The figures of the cost of surplus as estimated by the Board, togetherAdie justification for a grant, have been included in Section 2 of this Report,lg with the Board&apos;s overall financial situation. The Board, with assistancefrom the Ministry of Transport economists, will refine these figures so far aspossible over the next few months in order to produce the best available estimatebefore transport legislation is introduced into Parliament. We must emphasise,however, that there is bound to be a large element of uncertainty until the board have identified in detail where surplus exists or can be created.
OTHER OBLIGATIONS DERIVING FROM THE PASTc.1 We have explained in paragraph 1.15 that we have completed the workof examining these obligations. The following paragraphs set out our conclusions and recommendations, except in so far as they involve finance, in which case they have already been included in Section 2 of the main Report.Road Bridges and Level CrossingsC.2 The total cost of over line bridges in 1965 was  1,506,000, of which some  900,000 was to revenue account, and therefore an addition to the deficit.For the 2i years up to 1960, the Ministry had agreed to pay the Railwayssome  2m. per year towards the cost of road bridges and level crossings, becauseof the extent to which this had been inflated by the growth in road traffic.The payment was stopped in 1960, because it was thought administrativelymore convenient to deal with this through the revenue deficit. In additionto the above figures the Board pay  40,000 per annum to the Ministry inrespect of their relief from liability for the trunk road bridges which were transferred to the Minister in 1946. They also have to find about  327,000 perannum for the road surfaces of bridges. As regards protected level crossingsover public roads, of which there are some 2,800 at present, their total costin 1965 was just under  li-m. The present statutory framework of responsi-bility for bridges and level crossings is obviously complicated and unsatisfactory.The main disadvantages are that there is a lack of clearly defined obligations,great administrative complexity, failure to reach satisfactory standards of provision, and administrative difficulties which often prevent the removal ofbridges which are no longer necessary.BridgesC.3 Against this background, it seemed to us that in principle, existinghighway over line bridges should be regarded as part of the highway, and it isclearly inappropriate that financial responsibility should remain with the rail-ways. Although it would seem logical to transfer the bridges to highway authorities, this is impossible because of the way the Rate Support Grant is distributed. It would, therefore, be necessary to transfer them to the largerlocal authorities. But the Rate Support Grant is based on complicated calcu-lations which would make it impossible to compensate the local authoritiesin an equitable manner. (Figures submitted to us show that the compensationfor the transfer of these bridges would vary as between one authority andanother from  100 to  500 per bridge per annum.)C.4 We have had to conclude that, although there is a good case in equityfor transferring the bridges, in law the case is less good, and the practicaldifficulties are too large to be ignored. In reaching this conclusion we havealso had in mind that these bridges represent only one-sixth of all the bridgesfor which the Board are responsible, and that in any case it would be sensible,on manpower grounds (as well as for safety reasons), to leave the responsibilityfor the physical maintenance of these bridges with the Board, since in practice,even if they lost responsibility for these bridges, the Board could hardly makeany reduction in their maintenance staff.C.5 We therefore recommend that ownership of road bridges over the railwayshould remain with the Board, but that as set out in Section 2, account shouldbe taken of these costs, which amount to about  Urn. per annum, in thefinancial reconstruction which we propose.C.6 We also recommend that the Board&apos;s present payment of  40,000 perannum in respect of trunk road bridges should be discontinued. We alsosuggest that, even if the bridges themselves are to continue in the Board&apos;sownership, their present responsibility for the surfaces of all over line bridgesshould be borne by the appropriate local authority.   Finally, the Transport
Bill should bring up to date the Board&apos;s present duties in respect of maintenanceatfUgsent based on minimum legal liability, and the powers of the InspectingOjfHs of Railways in relation to railway bridges already owned by localauthorities should be extended.Level CrossingsC.7 So far as level crossings are concerned, we have concluded that themethod of crossing operation, and the fact that control must remain with therailways, make it quite impossible to seek any financial contribution fromthe local authorities to the operating costs of public road level crossings, although we note the Ministry&apos;s proposal to introduce legislation empowering localauthorities to contribute to the capital cost of their improvement.C.8 In view of the extent to which level crossing costs have been inflatedas a result of the growth in road traffic, and the change in its nature, andalso in the light of the additional responsibilities which we are informed theMinister proposes to put on the Board in respect of accommodation and occupation crossings, we think that it would be right to relieve the Board ofa figure of the order of  lm. per year. We have recommended in Section 2of this Report that this is the figure which should be taken into account in the calculations leading to our proposals for recapitalisation.PensionsC.9 The problems in this field are more difficult. The main questions to resolve are whether, and if so how far, the Board should be relieved of super-annuation and pension liabilities relating to staff previously employed on socialor abandoned lines, and its obligations which result from decisions of theBoard&apos;s predecessors. There is also the problem of the interest burden onsuperannuation and pension fund deposits and provisions which were no longerrepresented by any viable assets. We realise that in facing these issues we areasking whether the Board should, in effect, be regarded as a new body, startingafresh from the current date, with only the liabilities that they have chosen to impose on themselves for the future, or whether it is right that they shouldbe saddled with some part at least of the legacy of the past.CIO If the arguments for releasing the Board from its obligations were accepted in full, this might represent a sum of the order of  15m. to  20m. per year. To do so, however, would be a most unfortunate precedent for otherindustries in a similar position.C.11 We have had to look into the figures in considerable detail, and think itmay be helpful to set them out under two separate heads as follows:C.11.1   The Interest BurdenUsing 1965 figures the Board had to pay:  (a) Interest on Superannuation and Pension Fund portion of provision for Retirement Benefits       .........       3.6m. p.a.(b) Interest on Fund balances held on deposit by british railways Board     ..................       6.2m. p.a.(c) Interest on balance of BTC (Male Wages Grades)Pension Scheme     ..................       lm. p.a.Total......     10.8m. p.a.The capital sums to which these interest charges relate (about  270m.) arenot represented by cash, but by fixed assets in which, at one time or another, the monies have been invested. They are an integral part of thecapital structure of the Board and the interest charges to which they giverise cannot be considered separately from the question of the overall interestburden of the Board&apos;s capital liabilities.
C.11.2 The Pensions Obligations resulting from the decisions, and practices,of the Board&apos;s predecessorsThese obligations include the following: (a) Future charges to revenue in respect of a deficiency (not yet quantified)emerging from the application of realistic assumptions on wages, etc.to the valuation of the funds. The present capital value of thesedeficiencies may well amount to a further  50m.(b) An unquantified figure reflecting the extent to which the Board maybe involved in further deficiency payments attributable to provisionsof the LMS Pension Scheme.The Joint Working Team have estimated that these and other pensionobligations of which the Board consider they should be relieved (these includecharges to revenue in respect of the liquidation of Superannuation Funddeficiencies, the difference between the rate of interest credited to fundsdeposited with the Board and a realistic rate of interest, the differencebetween the contributions actually being paid by salaried staff and what theywould be paying under the contribution rates prescribed in the new pensions scheme, the cost of future deficiencies and the cost of payments undernon-statutory customary practices) might amount to about  8m. to  9m. perannum, but this depends to a considerable extent on the rate at which any deficiencies in the Fund were to be liquidated.C.12 These sums together add up to a total of about  17m. to  20m. per annum.As set out above, something over half of this relates to the interest burden onsums invested with the Board, the remainder to the burden on the Board resultingfrom decisions of their predecessors.C.13 In addition to the foregoing there is a capital obligation estimated at  20m.(resulting in an annual revenue charge of  1.6m.) in respect of the back-datingelement of the new wages grade fund and continuing obligations of  0.15m. ayear in respect of the extension of the benefits of the new fund to staff who retired between 1st January, 1967, and the start of the new fund in August, 1967.There are also deficiencies on other funds of the order of  20m. which are beingcurrently met by charges to revenue at the rate of  1.5m. a year. This figuretogether with the  1.6m. mentioned earlier and the  0.15m., have been allowed for as expenditure chargeable to revenue in the long-range revenue forecasts.C.14 We are sure that it would set a dangerous precedent to make any specific grants in relief of the Board&apos;s pension obligations. These are clearly obligations which have to be met, and the only question is whether the payment should and could be made in future by the Board. We recommend in Section 2 of thisReport that account should be taken of these obligations in the financial recon-struction which we propose.C.15 So far as can now be assessed (although these figures will need further study) the total capital value of the pensions obligations is of the order of 370m. as compared with  275m. in the balance sheet at 31st December, 1966.The capital values adopted for the reappraised superannuation obligationsassume an interest rate of 5 per cent compared with the current rate of 4 percent. The future annual interest burden will therefore be of the order of 19m. compared with the present figure of film. Against this increase of  8m.can be offset the avoidance of deficiency charges to revenue of some  3m.leaving  5m. increased charges to be taken into account in the forward revenueestimates and the assessment of the debt to the Minister.Museums and Historical RecordsMuseumsC.16 We are satisfied that the Transport Museums have a useful scientific,educational and cultural role to play. The Joint Team think that the greaterpart of the exhibits in them should be preserved, and we consider that provision for the future of such exhibits as are preserved should be such asto assure their continuing development. We are agreed that it would be inthe interests of the Railways Board, and beneficial from the standpoint of museum
policy generally, that the Board should build a new Transport Museum, fortastefer to the Department of Education and Science as an outstation of thesflHbe Museum, with the funds realised from the sale of the Clapham site. Ourderailed conclusions and recommendations are as follows:  C.16.1 It would not be possible to set up a new purpose-built transportmuseum, the primary purpose of which was to replace the museum atClapham, and to pay for it from the proceeds of the sale of the Claphamsite.C.16.2 The conversion of an existing building would, however, enable anew museum to be provided out of the money released which wouldprobably amount to about  517,000 by the sale of the sites of the presentmuseums at Clapham and York. Neither the Railways Board nor theLondon Transport Board have a building available in the London area, butthe Railways Board have suggested the conversion of a motive power depot at York which would be well fitted to serve as a transport museum, andwhich could be satisfactorily converted within the limits imposed by availablefunds. The Department of Education and Science would, subject to approval by Ministers, be prepared to assume responsibility for a museum provided in this way, and the Ministry of Public Building and Works would accept responsibility for its maintenance.C.16.3 If the proposed new museum at York was administered by theDepartment of Education and Science, and the policy of charging for admission was continued, total net costs would be about  15,000 a yearless than those at present incurred by the Railways Board on the existingtransport museums at Clapham and York. Since museum costs go to swellthe railway deficit, a move to York would reduce the total cost of themuseums to the Exchequer, provided that the Department of Education and science were to continue the present charging policy. (To discontinuecharging would increase the present annual costs of the collections to theExchequer by about  10.000 p.a.)C.16.4 The conversion of the York depot would provide enough space forall those railway exhibits which, in the view of the Science Museum, meritpreservation in a national transport collection. The London transport board have indicated that they would prefer to take their own relics back into their keeping rather than see them removed to York, and we under-stand that this should result in a decrease in the London Transport Board&apos;annual expenditure on relics.C.16.5 We recommend that those exhibits which would not qualify for inclusion in a national collection should, in accordance with the established practice, in the first instance be offered free of charge to local museums and recognised preservation societies, and those for which homes were not foundshould be sold. Any sums realised in this way should be added to the funds available for setting up the new museum.C.16.6 The Department of Education and Science would not be willing toassume responsibility for the museum at Swindon. We therefore recom-mend that the Railways Board should open negotiations for the transfer ofresponsibility for the museum at Swindon to Swindon Corporation.RecordsC17 As regards the historical records, we are satisfied that they are of no value to the Board in running their business, but we accept that the bulk of themmerit preservation on grounds of general educational usefulness and as illustrat-ing an aspect of social history. We think there may be some scope for reductionin the amount spent on preserving the records, by centralising the English recordsin one building, but we accept that they are not suitable for inclusion in thePublic Record Office.C.17.1 It would be physically possible to accommodate the records atpresent held in the Railways Board&apos;s Record Office in London in a smallextension, costing about  60,000, to the proposed York Museum. In viewof the relatively small sum involved we recommend that the occasion should
be taken to transfer the historical records to York, even if this cannot bedone entirely within the financial limits set by the proceeds from thejHJeof the Clapham and York sites. (    JC.17.2  The Standing Commissions on Museums and Galleries have been consulted and are broadly satisfied with the above proposals.C.17.3   We finally recommend that provision should be made in the forth-coming Bill to enable these proposals to be carried out, and that the neces-sary arrangements might be left to the Board and the Ministry.Railways Savings BanksC. 18 We explained in Section 2 that there was no short-term problem in regardto the Railways Savings Banks but that the interest on deposits had to be takeninto account in assessing the total amount of interest burden which it would be appropriate for the Board to carry for the future. We have dealt with this aspect in Section 2.C.19 In the course of our enquiries we looked at the trend of deposits over recent years. Deposits fell by  2-9m. from 1963 to 1965. They fell by a further 2-7m. in the first six months of 1966 to  37-3m. For the whole period 1959 to1965 withdrawals exceeded new deposits to the extent of  16m. After creditinginterest totalling  13m. the fall in total deposits amounts to a little over  3m.C.20 The Team&apos;s researches show that the costs of administration would notdiminish in proportion to the reduction in the total amount of deposits. Equallyadministrative costs would not be affected to any major extent by an increase ofthe order of 15 to 20 per cent, in the number of accounts deposited, and now that much of the calculation is done by computer, computer costs would notbe materially affected by an increase of up to 40 per cent.C.21 These circumstances provide strong arguments why the railways should try to increase the present size of deposits. Furthermore, and of equal import-ance, they are a source of relatively cheap capital for the railways as well as an incentive to savings amongst railway staff.C-22   In these circumstances we have already recommended:C.22.1 That the existing basis of operation of the Railways Savings Banksis left basically unchanged.C.22.2 That positive steps be taken by the Board to encourage an increasein membership of the Banks and of the extended use of payroll deductionsas a regular means of savings. ,C.22.3 That the interest rate payable on deposits should be adjusted tobring the bank into line with other comparable banks.C.22.4 That in addition to Railways Board employees, employees of aNational Freight Organisation should in future be eligible as depositors inan enlarged &quot; Transport &quot; Savings Bank.G.23 We should record that the Board have already largely implemented theabove recommendations. Following the centralisation and computerisation ofthe existing banks at Darlington, a new BR Savings Bank has now be estab-lished and the former banks closed.Transport PoliceC.24 It appears that the services of the Transport Police may be regarded asfalling into three distinguishable (but not exclusive) categories:C.24.1 The protection of property in which are included the safeguarding of the premises and property of the Board, and of goods in transit and theproperty of travellers.   This is clearly the sole responsibility of the Board.C.24.2 The detection of crime, which is mainly a function of the CriminalInvestigation Department (CID).C.24.3 General public services, such as the control of traffic in the vicinity of main railway stations, the marshalling of crowds, general help to membersof the public and the maintenance of public order.
C.25 The Railways Board have claimed that some element of grant for bothG^2 and C.24.3 above would be justified. They have emphasised that nearlyaglffir cent, of the Transport Police arc in the CID and without them crimesorfThe railways would merely be reported to the Civil Police Forces for investi-gation by them. The Transport Police CID thus provide relief for the CivilPolice Forces, and also render direct assistance, for example, in 1965 by makingabout 725 arrests. Furthermore, they are able to cope better in circumstances where knowledge of transport operations is essential. As regards services forthe general public, some 24 per cent, of the Transport Police are employed inthis fielU much of which is common with that covered by the Civil Police (e.g.control of immigration).C.26 On the other hand, it can be argued that the railways provide a police force largely for sound commercial reasons, and that their public image, and thecost of losses, would be materially affected by any reduction of their policeactivities.C.27 We have concluded that, while it is a matter for the Railways Board toconsider whether they v/ant to maintain a Police Force, and although an element of the force is entirely a commercial responsibility of the Board itself, some part of the benefit from the particular services of the Police devoted to thedetection of crime and to general public services accrues to the general public and affords relief to the civil forces.C.28 It has proved impossible to provide a precise assessment of police servicesand their benefits and any apportionment must necessarily be a matter of judg-ment. Some of us have argued that apart from any fall-out benefit from theservices of the Transport Police as a whole, the particular benefits accruing fromthe services devoted to the detection of crime and the general public services were sufficiently substantial to merit financial recognition.C.29 Others of us disagree with this view, and do not think that it has beenestablished that, if the Board decided to limit their police services to what wouldbe desirable on commercial grounds, this would make a significant reduction inthe British Transport Police and its cost. It is in their view clearly unreasonable to describe any &quot;fall-out&quot; benefit to the community at large as being &quot;sub-stantial&quot;. Moreover, there are fall-out benefits in the other direction, i.e. tothe Board from the activities of the Civil Police.C.30 We have finally concluded that we must accept that there is a case forsome public contribution towards these costs. The main reason for this is thatthe Transport Police clearly perform duties over and,, above those which areproper to a commercial organisation. In the past it has been expected that public bodies should assume some social obligations without remuneration, butwe take it that it is now established Government policy to recompense therailways for expenditure incurred for social reasons. No precise basis forapportionment can be arrived at, but we suggest that calculations should bebased on 50 per cent, of the cost of the force attributable to CID and to general public service functions. This would amount to about  600,000 per annum,i.e. about 20 per cent, of the total cost of maintaining the British TransportPolice.C.31 We have therefore recommended in Section 2 of this Report that the continuing services by the British Transport Police to the general public shouldbe recognised by including in the proposed capital reconstruction of the board a specific element in respect of these police costs.
UNREMUNERATIVE PASSENGER SERVICES ^D.1. Soon after we were appointed we asked the Consultants to carry put a review of a number of the services which are currently running at a loss, andfor which closure had been refused by the Minister, or her predecessors. their main objectives were to consider possibilities for reducing costs (e.g. by reducingthe amount of track, using conductor guards on trains, simplifying protectionarrangements at level crossings, etc.) and also for increasing revenue (e.g. byadjustments of fare levels and by providing the service best suited to the needsof the travelling public, having due regard to economy).D.2 The work showed that, in respect of five services, all of which were largelyrural in type, the loss at the time when closure was refused could be substan-tially reduced. Much of this reduction is attributable to steps which have eitherbeen taken, or are currently being planned, by British Railways, but the Con-consultants made further suggestions for consideration by the Board. Not all ofthese, of course, may be feasible.D.3 The Consultants have now prepared a draft questionnaire, all or part ofwhich, depending on circumstances, would need to be completed by the british railways Board in respect of each service before an application for a social grantwas made, and which could then serve as the actual application form for sucha grant. We have provisionally approved this draft and it is being tested inpractice using a sample exercise covering some 25 unremunerative passenger services.D.4   The purpose of the questionnaire is:  D.4.1   to provide the Ministry with information on:  (a) the present service and its operating methods ;(b) the present usage of the service and its financial results ;(c) the Board&apos;s proposals for changes in the service and its operatingmethods ;(d) a forecast of the financial results for three years ahead.D.4.2 to enable the Board to demonstrate that the service is being, or is planned to be, operated at an optimum level that is, at the minimum deficitconsistent with meeting the local demand.D.4.3 to provide the Ministry with the basic information to assist them tomake an assessment of:  (a) whether the social need is sufficient to justify the grant;(b) whether there is any scope for improving the financial results by reduc-ing the level of service or improving operating methods while stillsatisfying the basic social need.The assessment will have to start from the present service, but the questionnaireis designed to lead to a decision being based on the best available assessment of future needs.&apos;D.5 The assessment of social need is fundamental to the Minister^ decision asto whether or not a service should be grant-aided. The questionnaire providesfor the Ministry to receive basic information on the present usage of the railservice together with a list of alternative transport services. The Consultantshave advised that, in their view, this information should be sufficient in themajority of cases. If, in some, borderline, cases more information is required thanthe Board has in their possession, the Ministry will have to obtain this from whatever source is most convenient, including possibly in the most difficult casesmounting a full market survey of passenger demand.D.6   The present and projected financial results will be set out in full, and willalso be expressed in terms ofD.6.1   percentages of earnings ;D.6.2   rates per train mile ; and d.6.3   rates per passenger mile.
The expression of the deficit as a percentage of earnings will be helpful bymng the extent to which current passengers are in fact paying their way.IWexpression of a rate per train mile will be useful primarily as a basis forcomparison between services with similar characteristics. The Consultants hopethat the figure expressed as a rate per passenger mile will be particularly usefulas an evaluation of the passenger benefit which would result from the payment ofa grant. Whilst there will clearly be cases where on very strong social hardshipgrounds it may be necessary to pay an exceptional rate per passenger mile, this figure should prove a yardstick against which preliminary decisions can bereached. It will also be a useful tool for the determination of priorities if, inthe long run, the total amount of these grants has to be contained within anannual estimate.Track and Signalling CostsD.7 In their first report, the Consultants suggested that track and signallingcosts should be allocated to services according to the weight and number of trainsconcerned. In the light of the work of the Committee set up to consider standbycapacity, we are now considering whether it would be more logical, in cases wherethe capacity of a route is determined solely by the peak needs of a grant-aidedpassenger service, for that service to bear most of the costs of the track andsignalling, with the other services only bearing a proportion of the wear andtear costs. This would be particularly significant in cases where a line was usedjointly by a commuter passenger service and by other passenger and freight ser-vices. We are arranging that, in the processing of the sample exercise to whichwe have already referred, both methods of allocating track costs should be tried out, in order that we can see the practical effect of the alternative approaches.We propose to make further recommendations on this point in due course.Cost of Replacement Bus services.8 We still have to consider how best to cover the subventions to operators of bus services provided as a condition of the withdrawal of rail services. Weunderstand that discussions are continuing within the Ministry as to the pro-visions to be included in the forthcoming Transport Bill about bus services generally. Obviously the best method for dealing with the comparatively small number of bus services provided to replace withdrawn rail services will dependon the general pattern of the provisions to be made about the greater numberof bus services for the country as a whole. We are, however, clear that it follows from the new proposals for the Board&apos;s finances that the responsibilityfor these bus services should be removed from the railways.Passenger Transport AuthoritiesD.9 We have been kept informed by the Ministry about the development ofthinking on the constitution and duties of Passenger Transport Authorities. It isclear that, certainly in respect of unremunerative passenger services wholly withinconurbations, the arrangements which we have recommended for the payment of grants will not apply, and that the responsibility for paying grants will be laid upon these new Authorities. But on the assumption that this will not affect the overall financial position of the Board, we do not think that it is for us to go into the details of the arrangements which will be required. We strongly recom-mend, however, that the costing basis used for these calculations should be thesame as that adopted for the calculation of grants to be paid by the Minister.Future Programme of WorkD.10 The results of the sample exercise mentioned in para. 3 of this Appen-dix will be available in the autumn, and we then propose to review the whole situation, and to see how far the recommendations of the Consultants will be adequate for dealing with the identification of unremunerative services, thecosting of them, and the preparation of material on which the Minister can make a decision as to whether the service should be grant-aided on broad social and economic grounds. We hope that it will be possible for us to submit a further report later in the year, and that thenceforward the railways can proceed with
the submission of cases in respect of all the unremunerative passenger seraiswhich fall within the field of our previous recommendations. We regardaHsimportant that this should be done as quickly as possible so that, even berorea statutory grant scheme comes into full operation, the Board may be able to quote in their Annual Report more exact figures of the extent to which the deficit is related to the burden of these unremunerative, but socially necessary,passenger services.
Appendix  COSTING PRINCIPLES AND METHODSE.1 We have had the benefit of a very full report from the Consultants, which covers the whole of the ground in great detail. It still needs further study, and,as set out below, in one important respect further research is needed before final conclusions can be reached. But whilst the Consultants suggest that certain changes are desirable, their overall conclusion is that the present costing principles and the ways in which they are applied are generally sound and that, atleast on an interim basis, the methods now used to calculate movement costs for passenger profitability studies would be appropriate for grant purposes.E.2 The difficulties of railway costing arise mainly from joint costs (defined by the Consultants as those associated with the situation where the productionof one product enables the production of another to take place at no extra cost) and fixed costs (those which do not vary with changes in the quantityproduced). In recognition of this problem, British Railways have dividedtheir operating costs into two categories:  E.2.1 Direct costs-which are considered to be both variable and specific(that is they can be attributed directly to the traffic conveyed);E.2.2 Indirect costs (track and signalling and general administration) whichare normally treated as being both fixed and joint.E.3 We agreed with the Consultants that it is necessary, if the classification of costs is to be improved, that costing research should be undertaken to determine:  E.3.1 how, and on what time scale, costs vary with changes in either thevolume of traffic or other measures of railway output;E.3.2   what factors, other than output, affect the level of cost of eachThis is now in hand. It will be particularly important to ascertain how far costsvary from the average. We have also still to consider in the light of a further report from the Consultants which is expected shortly, how far the variouspresentations of costs meet the needs of managers who have to use these figures.E.4 The Consultants have recommended that interest should not be treatedas a cost, but should be recovered as part of a &quot; profit contribution&quot;. we accept that the present method of assessing interest, which involves allocatingto certain assets the sum actually paid by the Board in interest at the present,is unsatisfactory. We also accept that it should be distinguished from other costs. But we do not think that it is appropriate to think in terms of a profit contribution for an industry which is not intended to make profits, andwhich will certainly continue to be financed through fixed interest capital andnot equity shares. In these circumstances, we think that interest should becharged at a current rate, and that as far as possible it should be assigned tosoecific items needed for particular operations.E.5 Furthermore, we think that depreciation, for costing and grant purposes,should continue to be assessed on a replacement cost basis, and not on historiccosts. This seems essential if the full cost of operations is to be taken intoaccount, and if those assets of the railways which are to be retained are tobe kept in good order in perpetuity.E.6 The present accounting and information systems do not provide the informa-tion required for costing purposes, and it is necessary for the Traffic CostingService to ascertain costs either by analysis of the overall working results orby ad hoc studies. Both methods have considerable disadvantages, which wouldbe largely avoided if the budgets could be used for costing purposes to themaximum extent possible. The Consultants have reported that it shouldincreasingly be possible to calculate from the budgets the total and unit costs for individual locations and track sections, distinguishing between short-termvariable and long-term costs, and their proposals are now being studied in detail by the Board.activity.
F.1 The Consultants have made a preliminary report on some aspects of thebudgeting and management information systems of British Railways. we still have more work to do in this field, but there are certain preliminaryconclusions, which are sufficiently important to deserve some mention in thisReport. It is also right to record the Consultants&apos; view, with which we entirelyagree, that in view of the fact that the present procedures were introducedonly three to four years ago great strides have already been made by theBoard.F.2  Their recommendations are as follows:F.2.1 As far as practicable &quot;responsibility&quot; budgeting should be extendedso that individual area and depot managers within a division may be involved in the budgeting process.F.2.2  There should be a greater degree of co-ordination between the :(a) budgeted sales in terms of both receipts and volume of activity ;(b) estimated physical resources required to achieve the expected sales;and(c) expenditure budgets which should represent the cost of providing theresources required.F.2.3 There should be an analysis of the differences between budgetedand actual results for activities or locations in order to show separatelythe effects of:(a) differences between the actual level of output and that envisaged inthe budgets;(b) changes which are outside the control of the manager concerned ; andover or under spending for which the manager is responsible.F.2.4 In order to compare actual expenditure incurred with the expenditure which should have been incurred for the level of output actually achieved,it will be necessary to divide costs between those that may be expected to:(a) vary within the budget period with changes in the level of output;(b) remain unchanged, at least during the budget period.If this attempt is made to determine the variable? elements of the costs of activities, and if budgeting is extended to individual locations, then it wouldbe possible to make greater use of the budgets for costing purposes.- F.2.5 They entirely support the philosophy underlying the developments in management control information proposed in the Board&apos;s overall plan of September, 1964.) The principle of comparing the value (in terms of standard allowances) of output produced with the cost of the resourcesused in its production should, however, be extended to other activities.F.2.6 They regard it as important that the control information systems nowbeing planned should be designed to be integrated to the maximum extent possible with the budgetary control system. In turn, this integrated budgetarycontrol/management information system should, as far as possible, be designed to meet the requirements of the Traffic Costing Service and therebyreduce the need for ad hoc sample studies to ascertain the costs of individualactivities.F.3 We have not yet been able to take a final view on all these recommendations.We have ensured that the Consultants collaborate with the Board in carryingout a detailed investigation of the steps that would be required to carry into effectthose of their outline recommendations which we decide to accept, the advantages that this would provide for managerial decision-making, and the cost. Weshall be reporting on this further in due course. -FINANCIAL AND BUDGETARY CONTROL PROCEDURES
W LONG-TERM REVENUE FORECASTSSummary of Economic assumptions on which forecasts wereprepared by the BoardG.1.1 Between 1967 and 1975 total output will expand by 3 per cent perannum, industrial production by 3-3 per cent and wages will rise, in real terms,by 3 per cent per annum. There will be no change in the prices paid by theBoard for materials and services.G.1.2 Coal consumption and exports which amounted to 178 million tons in1966, will decline to 158 million in 1969 and about 135 million tons in 1974.*Within the totals, coal for electricity generation will rise slightly. consumption by the steel industry will be maintained and the remaining uses will decline,some drastically e.g. domestic. Production will be concentrated increasingly onthe East Midlands and South Yorkshire.&apos;G.1.3 Steel production, which was 24  million tons in 1966, will increase to28 million tons in 1969 and 31/32 million tons in 1974. The changeover toimported iron ore will continue and be substantially complete by 1974.G.1.4 Oil growth will be diminished, but not vitally, by natural gas develop-ments.G.1.5   Chemicals will represent an important growth industry.G.1.6 The population will rise by 2^/3 million by 1974. Consumer expenditure will increase by 2-2 per cent per annum and car ownership, at present 9  million,will reach 16 million. Competition from air will be maintained on main routesover 200 miles and, with a likely decrease in the cost of motoring in real terms,car competition will increase.G.1.7   There will be no Channel Tunnel by 1974.G.1.8 The 11,000 mile network will be reached in 1969 and maintained until1974.G.1.9 There will be no major difficulty in securing an allocation of investment for profitable projects or those essential to maintain profitable services.G.1.10 There will be no difficulty in getting rid of freight traffic or services which cannot be made profitable.G.1.11 The relationship with the National Freight Organisation will be such that the Railways&apos; present losses on sundries, which is of the order of  20million per annum, will be wholly transferred to that Organisation.* There were indications, as the excercise proceeded, that this figure was probably too high,and we therefore also considered an alternative assumption of 120m. tons. The Boardestimated that the effect of this on their net revenue in 1974 would be-a reduction ofabout  4m.

Jfe      TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE JOINT REVIEWl.^rne Government has reached the conclusion that for the foreseeable futurethere will be a need, as part of the country&apos;s transport system, for a substantialrailway network. In order to restore stability to an industry which has beenthe subject of continual change and uncertainty, and to enable management and staff to concentrate on the development of the system in the interests of thepublic and of trade and industry, the Government has decided that the basicsize of the railway network should be determined now. It will consist primarilyof routes linking the main centres of population and of industry and commerce,with additional routes to serve major freight traffic flows and to provideessential passenger services for commuters and others. There are still somelines, services and stations whose retention in modern conditions can no longer be justified, and their future will be decided under the usual procedure assoon as possible to avoid prolonging uncertainty.2. The Government and the Railways Board are determined that this stabilisedrail system shall play a full part in the transport system of the country and doso with rapidly increasing economic efficiency. Capital will be provided for the. replacement of rolling stock and the modernisation of traction systems and oftrack and signalling wherever this can be justified in economic terms. Investmentwill be concentrated on the main trunk routes carrying heavy flows of traffic,but other feeder and commuter lines will also be adapted to modern needs.3. The social and other considerations which have led to the decision to stabilise the rail network also make it necessary to substitute a new financialframework for that imposed by the Transport Act, 1962. It has become clear that the requirement contained in the Act for the Board to &quot; pay its way &quot; by the beginning of 1968 is entirely unrealistic and would, if pursued,force it into action which in many cases would be against the interests of thecommunity and inconsistent with the plans for transport and other services which the Government is developing. It must therefore be amended to provide more realistic and appropriate financial objectives and a new financial frame-work and discipline.4. Against this background the Minister of Transport and the Chairman ofthe Railways Board have agreed to undertake a review of certain aspects ofthe railway industry. For this purpose they have sei up a Joint steering group under the chairmanship of the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Transport.5. The Joint Steering Group will be assisted by an expert working party,consisting as necessary of independent accountancy and management consultantsand including economists from the Ministry&apos;s new Directorate General of Econo-mic Planning and by a number of joint Ministry/Railways Board teams investigat-ing particular subjects. The terms of reference of the review as a whole will beas follows:(a) to establish an acceptable basis for costing and to identify thosecategories of services (both passenger and freight) which are not coveringcosts ; to isolate those categories which are potentially viable ; to examinethe remaining loss-makers and to isolate those with no prospects of becoming viable ; and to cost in detail the annual loss on each passenger service which is unlikely ever to become viable so that the government can decide whether it should be grant-aided on broad social andeconomic grounds ;(b) to consider any steps in the field of pricing policy or elsewhere whichmay be necessary to improve the prospects of those services which arealready remunerative and those which are potentially viable ;(c) to examine the Board&apos;s methods of costing and financial control in thelight particularly of the new proposals for meeting the cost of essentialbut unremunerative services and of other changes proposed in theWhite Paper;
(d) to assess whether and, if so, to what extent the cost of the railwayinfrastructure includes an element of &quot; standby capacity &quot; ; ^(e) to examine the Board&apos;s investment programmes and the criterflpbrinvestment appraisal;(f) to examine the continuing obligations deriving from the past whichrest on the Board, including those in respect of road bridges andlevel-crossings, of superannuation and pensions for past and presentemployees, and of the British Transport Police Force;(g) to consider the suitability of the Board&apos;s management structure and procedures for the future operation of the system in the light of the contents of the White Paper and the changes which may stem therefrom ;(/z) to make consequential recommendations, including suggestions for possible legislative changes;and to report to the Minister of Transport and the Chairman of the railways board accordingly.(329282)   Dd. 121296   127   10/67   St.S.
