IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y*3 government 5C(67) 168 COPY NO. _125th October, 1967CABINETINDUSTRIAL EXPANSION BILL; DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Economic affairs was asked to consider,,  ia consultation with rny colleagues,a number of &quot;outstanding policy questions and to prepare a revised draft of the White Paper on Industrial Expansion,,2.       I have discussed with the Lord President, the Minister of technology and the Chief Whip the questions of parliamentary procedure involved.    We concluded that it would be best to drop theidea of a Select Committee;  and that schemes involving the use of newpowers granted by the Bill should in all cases be subject to affirmative resolution in Parliament.3,       I have discussed the treatment of the aircraft industry with theMinister of Technology.    We consider that the Bill-should dealspecifically with the Concord; and that it should be so drafted that thenew powers could be used for the Beagle Aircraft Company, and if need be (and subject to the satisfactory conclusion of negotiations with theCompanies concerned) for the airframe merger.4.       Officials have been considering the other unresolved Issues.I am in touch with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the President ofthe Board of Trade and the Minister of Technology on these and shallreport our conclusions in due course.    With one exception (seeparagraph 5 below), the issues involved do not affect the drafting ofthe White Paper,5.      It is, I think, desirable to include in the White Paper a paragraph about advisory machinery,    I do not think that it is eithernecessary or desirable to establish any statutory machinery under thenew legislation.    We should,, however, make it clear that we wouldsubject projects which were being considered for support under theBill to a rigorous examination both within the Government and, as ageneral rule, by a new panel to be drawn from members of theIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation (1958-59) and the National research and Development Corporation (NRDC) and staffed by those organisations.We should not commit ourselves to use the panel in every case, nor should we be bound by its advice which would be confidential and would
cover the technical feasibility and economic viability of proposedschemes and any other relevant aspects, including where appropriatethe effect on competition within the industry concerned,    I think thatthe 1958-59 and NPJOC would both agree to this (though we should need to clear it with them before publishing the White Paper) and I believe itwould go some way to allay criticism from industry,,60       I attach a revised draft of the White Paper,    The underlinedpassages reflect changes made to the previous draft in the light ofthe Cabinet discussion on 12th October;, my discussions with theLord President and the Minister of Technology and the proposalreferred to in paragraph 5 above *7.       I invite my colleagues to approve the text of the draft white paper (subject to clearance of the relevant passages with the 1958-59 andNRDC) for publication by the Minister of Technology and myself assoon as possible after The Queenss Speech.Department of Economic Affairs., S.

annex draft WHITE PAPERINDUSTRIAL EXPANSIONIji^odAict^ionOur national industrial policy is directed to promoting the efficient use of resources both in the public and private sectors.     The success of this policy requires the maintenanceof a close working relationship between the Government and -industry.     A vigorjous^jmd , successful^jrj^vaje^^-JPLQgffig^ essential if a satisfactory rate ofeconomic growth - permitting higher standards of living and improved social conditions - coupled with a healthy balanceof payments are to be achieved.     At the same time it isgenerally recognised here and in other advanced industrial countries that, although competitive market forces are a necessary spur to efficiency and provide an essential basisof investment decisions and the allocation of resources,they cannot by themselves be expected in every circumstanceto secure national economic objectives and the optimum useof resources, because of the possible divergence betweensocial and private costs and benefits.     For this reason,there has been a steady growth in the scale and variety ofGovernment measures affecting the private sector, whetherby the use of financial incentives to influence investmentdecisions in certain broad directions, or by support for particular projects.     The rapid advance of technology andthe increasing problems presented by the scale of inter-national competition are now giving rise to new needs in industry which call for a still more flexible response bythe Government.2.     Government and private industry have a common interestin industrial excellence and commercial success.     government policy is designed to facilitate the efforts of those1.
enterprising managements which are striving to meet the challenge of technical change and competition in world markets and to maintain and improve the efficiency andprofitability of their companies.     In the ordinary,,.c^ursesuch cpjmpanie,s will continue to rely on their own resources,augmented &quot;by general schemes of fiscal incentives, or to command support from commercial sources and existing financial institutions.

In the past, direct government support for specific projects in the private sector has &quot;been given to older and less profitable industries and to industries meeting some national purpose, such asdefence or regional development.     More recently, theGovernment have provided finance for new and technologicallyadvanced projects where the potential &quot;benefits to, the economywere greater than the returns which the companies concerned could expect to receive in the short term.     The programmes of assistance to computer and micro-electronics developmentare examples of this approach.     Another kind of special action,exemplified by the Ministry of Technology&apos;s pre-production orders for machine tools, is to facilitate the introductionof advanced equipment which is likely to &quot;be profitable, but which appears to involve too much risk for the customer until there has been experience of the new equipment.     Here theGovernment is reducing the marketing risks for the producer and the innovation risk for the customer.k*     This has taken place at a time when the Government and both sides of industry have been concerned to evolve effectivemethods of economic planning.     Within this setting industrial2.
policy has concentrated, first, on providing a series of measures designed to shift resources of manpower and capitalfrom less to more productive employment and to even out the geographical distribution of industrial activities;    and secondly, on providing assistance for structural change.Measures have been taken to encourage investment in modernplant and machinery in the manufacturing, extraction and construction industries;    to increase the benefits availableto industrial enterprise in Development Areas;    and to supporttechnological research and development in civil as well asin defence industries.5.      In particular, the resources of the N.R.D.C. have beenenlarged so as to enable it to support the development andexploitation of commercially promising projects within its scope.     The I.R.C. has been set up to promote, and where necessary to finance, the structural changes which moderntechnology and international competitive conditions require.At the same time the Minister of Technology has been given authority to engage in or support research and development and to further the application of the resultsa      These variouspowers have been used to good advantage as in the help givenby the N.R.D.C. in the fields of data-processing andantibiotics, by the I.R.C. to reorganisation within theelectronics industry and by assistance from the Minister of technology to automation schemes.EkS. need^jCor f^ the partnership6.     But it has become clear over the past year or so thatthese provisions are not enough to enable the Government totake the action needed to further their policy of seeking toensure that necessary investment in the interest of theexpansion of our industrial capabilities is not held back.7.     A main purpose of the Ministry of Technology from the start was to identify key points of growth and to bring abouta more rapid application of advanced technology.     The Ministry3.CONFIDENTIAL
has wide powers to support research and technological development, but the scope for exploiting the results ismore limited.    If the Government are to play their full part in the industrial expansion which technological development now makes possible , they must be able to operatemore directly and more flexibly in support of industry tohelp overcome obstacles in the field of production and marketing as well as in research and development.    In the wider context of the reorientation of research and develop-ment policy, the Government consider there should be closerlinks between Government research establishments andindustrial companies vrtiich can exploit and market theresults of research so that they should be able to drawmore effectively on the resources of these research estab-lishmentsj    on occasions also, the Government may need toestablish a new industrial capability by themselves or in association with others.8.     One of the problems facing the national economy isthat investment programmes need to be sustained to providefor the future growth of demand.    Any decline in the levelof industrial expansion may lead to disproportionate falls in orders in the investment goods industries.    As a result,the industries concerned may have to reconsider theirexpansion and development plans.    If these are cut back and the employment of engineers and skilled manpowerreduced, the capacity of these industries to meet investmentdemand when it eventually recovers will be inadequate.    Ifthe Government are to be in a position to support investmentat these times, they must be able to take steps, in additionto action under the Investment Grant Scheme,  to provide thenecessary assistance to appropriate key sectors of industry.The need for action of this kind in the machine-tool industry has recently been under discussion, but within existingh.
powers it has &quot;been possible to help only by increasing thepre-production order scheme.    Experience has shown that other measures of support, whether for this or other importantsectors of industry, could not be speedily implemented withoutseparate legislation in ea,ch case.9.     Thu main task of the I.R.C. is to promote industrial reorganisation although it may, if requested to do so by theSecretary of State for Economic Affairs, contribute to thedevelopment of individual enterprises.    The Government haveclose and regular contacts with the Corporation and intend touse its facilities to the full and to seek its advice wheneverappropriate.    There will, however, be cases involvingindustrial development where action by the I.R.C. will not,for one reason or another, be suitable.    For example, theremay be a need for long-term public participation arisingfrom Government industrial or social policy, particularlyregional policy, which the 1958-59 would not normally consider appropriate to its role.    The reorganisation of the ship-building industry is an example of an operation where adifferent approach was called for.10.    The further development of the Governments positiverole as partner with industry is therefore cr ating newneeds for legislation to deal with particular situations.In the absence of new general legislation,  separate billswill be required to cover the needs of the aircraft industry.The Government is considering proposals for the developmentof an aluminium smelting industry in Britain.    This is afurther example of the type of project which, under present arrangements, would require separate legislation.11.   But the Government are not concerned solely withlegislative authority for proposals which have already been worked out with industry or are under negotiation.    They arealso concerned to be able to respond promptly to further
needs as they emerge.    It is important that,  in exploringfurther possibilities,  especially those holding promise of future export growth, neither Departments nor companies should be deterred by the fear that opportunities to implementprojects might be lost because of the delays involved in securing separate legislation.    In such cases, where a successful break-through in development or production whichis of particular value for the economy can be realised, but where for special reasons adequate funds are not available from the company&apos;s own resources or through commercialchannels, the Government^must &quot;be able to supplement thosesources of finance./ji^Jndjistr^ial Expansion, Bill12.     What is needed is a faster and more flexible procedure for implementing the Government&apos;s side of its partnership with industry.    The Government therefore propose to introduce legislation to authorise the Minister of Technology and other ministers with responsibilities for industries to providedirect assistance to industrial projects designed^to promoteefficiency;    to support technological advance;    or to create,expand or sustain productive capacity,  especially in theDevelopment Areas.    The Minister concerned, with the consentof the Treasury, would be empowered to give financial support which might according to circumstances take the form of loans,grants, guarantees, the underwriting of losses or the purchaseof equity shares to projects falling within the purposes ofthe Bill.    For the Minister of Technology this would be awidening of the scope of his powers under the Science and technology Act, 1965? for carrying on or supporting scientific research or the dissemination of the results of scientific research,  and under the Civil Aviation Act, 19U9, to supportthe design, development and production of civil aircraft.The new Bill would enable the Minister to support the design,6.
development and production of other products, in addition to civil aircraft.    It is proposed to include in the Bill a1 igit to the total, of, financialas^s^stan^e^j^jp^may be madeay a i 1 abl e^to ^inohis tr ^ J^djgj^ i^t^Operation of the New Powers13.     The Bill v/ill not confer any compulsory powers, either directly or indirectly, and the Government have no intentionof compelling a firm to take part against its wishes.    Forthe Government to use compulsion would clearly not accord with their purpose of launching successful projects in partnership with private industry.    It follows that the bill would not confer any powers to acquire shares in any industrialundertaking otherwise than by voluntary agreement.    TheGovernment do not intend to acquire shares^fj^jely^jgn^themarket, and would purchase, holdings only in^agreement^withthe JTirms c one erne d.lh.    The provision of Government finance, under the Bill, forprojects in the private sector should not be subject to anyless stringent examination than that applied to investment in the private sector or in the nationalised industries.    Theeconomic return on ever    project will bo carefully appraisedto establish its prospect of long-run profitability.    It isinherent in the policy outlined in this White Paper that theGovernment should be selective in the support that they givewithin the private sector.    The Government recognise thatthere may be concern lest they give preference in procurementpolicy etc. to firms because they have shareholdings in thorn,or use their shareholdings to interfere in the day to day management of a company.    This is not the purpose which theGovernment would have in mind in acquiring shareholdings aspart of schemes of industrial development under the Bill.The Government are nonetheless willing to discuss with industrywhether any particular safeguards are needed.    The powers to7-
8.assist industry would of course be exercised with due regard tothe Government&apos;s international obligations.15.   ^The ^Government will itself subject projects which are beingconsidered for support under the new legislation to a comprehensiveevaluation^ ^As^ general rule, they will call upon the advice ofthe I -RjC^* aiid N .R    .Gt who^l^^e^&apos;agreed to set up an advisarypanel ^consisting of members of the two bodies and staffed by themfor ^this purpose.16.     The role of Parliament in the evolution of a closer partner-ship between Government and industry is of critical importance.In.Pgdjg^tp, ensure, that schemes put forward under the newlegis^at;icnjxr-e^subwill provide that, before making use in any particular case of newpowers granted-underwit, the Minister concerned would be requiredto define the particular proposals in an Order to be laid beforeParliament and to obtain the approval of the House of Commons for proceeding with them.     It is envisaged that Orders under the bill will provide for the proposed acquisition of the Beagle AircraftCompany Limited, which has already been agreed with the industrialinterest concerned; for the financing of Her Majesty5s Government&apos;s share of the production of the Concord; and, subject to theconclusion of negotiations now in progress for the purchase of aGovernment shareholding in the aircraft industry.Conclusion17.     In the Governments view the proposed measure is bothnecessary and urgent if schemes for industrial exi)ansion are notto be delayed.     The Bill will provide the framework for a furtherstage in the development of Government&apos;s partnership with industry for the encouragement of increased investment and more rapid&quot;application of modern technology.
