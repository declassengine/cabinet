2.      This will be a statute of major importance to the firms andprofessions affected, an important piece of public health legislation and an essential contribution to consumer protection.    Our intention tointroduce legislation as soon as possible to modernise the law relatingto the safety, quality and description of drugs and medicines was announced in Parliament in June, 1965 shortly after the Home AffairsCommittee agreed that a Bill should be drafted.    But the interests affected are as yet unaware of the extent to which the Government intend to follow or depart   from the proposals on which they were invited by theprevious Government to comment in August, 1964.    The Bill has a place in the main programme for the 1967-68 Session, and will be ready for introduction early in the Session.3.     Legislation on this subject is urgently required and widelyexpected; if the United Kingdom joins the European Economic Communityit will be imperative.    The &quot;pharmaceutical revolution&quot; of the last30 years introduced powerful and valuable new medicines that havesuperseded most of the traditional medicines, but they have given riseto new problems for which our existing legislation was never designed.Safeguards of the kind proposed already apply in Canada and other commonwealth countries, the U. S..A. , France, Germany and other european countries.    Judging by the comments received on the 1964proposals we expect that the legislation will command general support in the industry and the professions, and be politically uncontroversial,though as is usual with Bills of this kind, we may expect amendments inParliament directed at probing points of detail.[DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) [67JJ43 COPY NO.   659th August, 1967CABINETPROPOSED MEDICINES LEGISLATION;DRAFT WHITE &quot;FAPERMemorandum by the Minister of health in accordance with the decision of the Home Affairs Committeeon 27th July with the agreement of the Joint Parliamentary Under -Secretary of State for Scotland and the Joint Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, I circulate for theinformation of the Cabinet a draft White Paper on the forthcominglegislation on the safety, quality and description of drugs andmedicines.    The Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food and I are anxious to publish this as early as possible in September so as to give the various interests affected as long notice as possible of the Governments broad intentions.I should be grateful therefore if members of the Cabinet could let mehave by 29th August any observations that they wish to make on the draft,with a view to its being presented as a Command Paper about7th September and published on the following day.
4.     The proposed Bill will apply to both human and veterinarydrugs, and be capable of extension to cover specified medical devicessuch as implants of metal and plastic, catheters, syringes and surgicaldressings.    It includes a licensing scheme for marketing, importation,manufacture and wholesaling of drugs and medicines, the purpose ofwhich is to provide the statutory basis for (a) safeguards in relation tothe toxicity testing of new drugs before clinical trial, and the assess-ment, before they are marketed for general use, of their safety inrelation to their efficacy; and (b) provisions to secure adequatequality control in the course of manufacture.    Other safeguards will apply in relation to distribution, retail sale and supply of drugs.    Newpowers will be included for regulating the labelling of drugs and theirpromotion to the public and to the medical, dental and veterinaryprofessions, including provisions aimed at restraining therapeuticclaims that are misleading or not supported by data relating to thepharmacological properties of a drug or results observed in itsclinical use.    In future the poisons law, for which the HomeSecretary, advised by the Poisons Board^ is responsible, will apply only to non-medicinal uses of substances,5.     The legislation will apply to the whole of the United Kingdomand responsibility for the operation of the regulatory powers,including licensing, will be shared by the Agriculture and health ministers.    The Government of Northern Ireland has approved of thelegislation in principle.    The Ministers will have the support of aprofessionally independent advisory Medicines Commission andassociated expert committees.6.      The White Paper describes the reasons for legislating, the broad scope of the Bill and the general pattern of its implementationbut does not go into every detail that will have to be covered by theBill.    It is not intended to start a new round of consultations byinviting comments on the proposals since they represent the Governmedfefirm intentions, following careful study of numerous comments on proposals previously circulated to the professions, trade associations and other interests.7.     The staff now engaged in administering the voluntary screeningof new drugs and in assembling reports of suspected adverse reactionsfor the Committee on Safety of Drugs, together with those engaged onthe existing licensing scheme under the Therapeutic Substances Act,will suffice to meet the basic staffing needs of the Ministers under thenew licensing system and to service the Medicines Commission and the associated advisory committees.     The main expansion will occur inrelation to the provisions for general enforcement, chiefly in relationto quality control and regulation of labelling and advertising.    On theassumption that the new powers will be administered with the general support of the industry and professions and that frequent litigationwill be unnecessary, we estimate the additional staffing requirementswhen the controls are fully operative - say in 1970 or 1971 - at about80 persons, of whom about two-thirds would be professional or technical (about 10 doctors, 16 pharmacists, and a few other graduatescientists together with associated technicians), including the staff who
will come over from the British Pharmacopoeia Commission.    Theestimated additional annual cost to the Health Departments inclusive of accommodation, office services etc, is  350f 000 and to the agriculture Departments  40,000.    To some extent the cost wouldprobably be offset by licence fees.    Consideration will also have to begiven later to the need for additional laboratory facilities, mainly forquality control;  the above estimate does not take account of this.Ks R.Ministry of Health. 1,9th August, 1967-3-
Annex to C(67) .Hi?m.FORTHCOMING LEGISLATION ON THE SAFETY,QUALITY AND DESCRIPTION OF DRUGS AND MEDICINESIntroduction1,     On li+th June, 19&amp;5 and again on 25th April, 1966 the\ Minister of Health stated in the House of Commons   In reply to questions that the Government intended to introduce legislationli relating to medicines.     This paper describes in broad terms the reasons for the legislation, its scope and the general! manner in which it will operate.2.     In 1962, after the devastating effects of thalidomidebecame known, there was widespread anxiety about the absenceof safeguards to ensure that new drugs should not be put on; the market before every possible step had been taken, in theI light of current medical and scientific knowledge, to bringharmful side effects of otherwise valuable new drugs to thenotice of doctors, who would then he able to weigh the risksagainst the expected therapeutic benefit.3.     A review of existing medicines legislation by officials of the Health Departments and the Home Office was already inprogress.     This had followed a report by the Poisons Board tothe Home Secretary in 1959 which expressed the view that furtherI legislation should be introduced urgently to provide for control over certain potent medicines which might involve serious risk if widely used in self-medication.     The Boardconsidered that such drugs would be more appropriately controlled
by legislation specifically related to medicines andadministered by the Health Ministers than under poisonslegislation.     Later in the same year the interdepartmental committee on Drug Addiction (under the chairmanship ofthe late Lord Brain) in an interim report recommended thatdrugs having an effect on the central nervous system and liable to produce physical or psychological deteriorationshould be restricted to supply on prescription, subject tothe advice of an independent expert body.     Since then, asan interim measure pending new legislation, the HomeSecretary&apos;s powers under poisons legislation have,  so faras applicable, been used for this purpose.k.     But the problem went deeper than this.     At the time ofthe thalidomide affair the only drugs whose marketing wascontrolled were those in the limited range that needed to be licensed by the Health Ministers under the TherapeuticSubstances Act 1956 (mainly sera, vaccines, injectableantibiotics and certain hormones and enzymes).     As regardsthe marketing of drugs in general, in a debate in the Houseof Commons on 8th May, 19^3 the present Minister of Health,then of course speaking on behalf of the Opposition, put it this way:    &quot;The House and public suddenly woke up to the factthat any drug manufacturer could market any product, howeverinadequately tested, however dangerous, without having tosatisfy any independent body as to its efficacy or its safety&quot;.5.     Following the thalidomide affair a joint sub-committee under the chairmanship of Lord Cohen of Birkenhead was set upby the English and Scottish Standing Medical Advisory committees to consider the situation.    It recommended that the responsibilityfor the experimental laboratory testing of new drugs before they were used in clinical trials should remain with theindividual pharmaceutical manufacturer;    that it was neither2.
desirable nor practicable that at this stage of theirevaluation the responsibility for testing drugs should betransferred to a central authority;    and that there shouldbe an expert body to review toxicity data of new drugs, andthe results of clinical trials.      It stressed that the safety of a drug was relative and depended on its toxicity,as revealed in laboratory tests and in clinical use, inrelation to its efficacy.      It also emphasised theimportance of other aspects of drug safety, e,g. controlof quality, control of sale over the counter, labelling ofcontainers, use of approved names (i.e, non-trade names),regulation of therapeutic claims, arrangements for controllingwhich would require legislation,     Though the Sub-Committeewas not set up to design new legislation, it neverthelessadvised that legislation relating to the safety andefficacy of drugs and to these other matters was urgently required.      In the meantime the majority ofthe Committee recommended the institution of a voluntary system of screening of drug toxicity data and the collectionof reports of adverse reactions to drugs in clinical use.This led to the appointment by the then Health Ministers ofthe Committee on Safety of Drugs under the chairmanship ofSir Derrick Dunlop, which has been working since thebeginning of 196k*6.     The voluntary system has had the full support of thepharmaceutical industry and the medical and pharmaceuticalprofessions, but the Government considers that the provisionof statutory backing for these safeguards would give greaterreassurance and should not be further delayed.3.
7.     The Committee on Safety of Drugs itself in its annual report for 19^5 said that whilst the Committee had not &quot;beenhampered by lack of statutory powers,  thanks to the co-operationof manufacturers,  it believed that the arrangements should be given permanence within the framework of legislation.      Itwelcomed an assurance given &quot;by the Minister in parliament that the aim would he to maintain under future legislation the scope for flexibility and the exercise of professionalresponsibility which the Committee&apos;s experience had shown tobe necessary.8.     Since taking office in October 196k, the Minister of Health,in conjunction with the other Ministers concerned, has carried forward the review of medicines legislation in the light ofthe comments received from many bodies and interests on proposals for legislation relating to drugs and medicaldevices for human use circulated for comment &quot;by his predecessor in August and September, 196^,  and of replies to a request by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries andPood in July 1965 for views on the extension of similarsafeguards to veterinary drugs and devices.9.     The review confirmed the view that the &quot;pharmaceuticalrevolution&quot; of the last 30 years, by introducing powerful and valuable new medicines which have superseded most of the traditional medicines, has given rise to new problems forwhich our existing legislation was never designed.      The needfor greater safeguards has been recognised in many othercountries too,  and controls similar in aim to those nowproposed have already been introduced into the laws ofCanada and other Commonwealth countries, the United States,France, Germany, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries,
and others.      Under the Treaty of Rome the countries of theEuropean Economic Community are actively engaged in preparing directives in relation to their medicineslegislation,  one of which is already in force.      In theevent of the United Kingdom joining the European economic community legislation would he needed before such directivescould be implemented here.Scope of the py^cjjsd^legj^j^bion10.    The legislation now proposed will introduce eithersubstantial changes or entirely new provisions v/here theexisting law is inadequate In relation to the various aspectsof &quot;safety&quot; mentioned in the Report of the Joint Sub-committee referred to in paragraph 5 above;    these will cover:-(l) statutory safeguards in relation to toxicitytesting of new drugs before clinical trial,and assessment of safety in relation toefficacy in the light of the results of suchtesting and trial before marketing;(2) new statutory safeguards to ensure adequatequality control of drugs including measuresto secure conformity with official standardsor approved manufacturers1 specifications;(3) additional safeguards in relation todistribution and retail sale and supply of drugs;(h) revised safeguards as regards description,labelling and advertising of drugs,  includingprovisions to restrain therapeutic claims thatare not supported by data relating to thepharmacological properties of a drug or resultsobserved in clinical use;(5) analogous safeguards in relation to medicaldevices.5.
11.    The legislation will he applicable to drugs and devicesfor both human and veterinary use.      The proposals have beenaccepted in principle by the Government of Northern Ireland;the Bill will therefore apply throughout the United Kingdom.It will contribute to &quot;consumer protection&quot; in two respects:first, it will improve the provisions designed to secure thatthe product supplied to the customer is what he asked for andthat he is not misled by description and labelling of the product or unsupported therapeutic claims;    and second,  It will ensure so far as possible that the professions can rely on thepurity and efficacy of the substances that they prescribe,supply and use in treating disease in man and animals,  and be fully informed about the properties,  desirable and undesirable,of these substances,  so that they can exercise their professionaljudgment in the light of this knowledge.12.    The responsibility for the control measures will lie with the Health and Agriculture Ministers of the UnitedKingdom.     They will be exercised by the Health Ministersalone,  the Agriculture Ministers alone,  or by all accordingto whether the safeguards to be applied relate to human aspects,veterinary aspects,  or both.     Where a risk to human healtharises in relation to a veterinary drug the Health and agriculture Ministers will be jointly responsible.      Asa consequence, the provisions in the existing poisonslegislation, for which the Home Secretary at present is responsible in Great Britain and the Minister of HomeAffairs in Northern Ireland, will no longer apply tomedicinal aspects of substances now in the respectivePoisons Lists.6.
The Medicines Commission and expert committees13.   In the exercise of their functions (including their functions as licensing authority) the Health and agriculture ministers will need expert advice and support over a wide field.The functions can he grouped under a number of broad headingsany of which may be directed at human or veterinary aspects,for instance:-(a) advice relating to specifications,  safety and efficacy,(b) the drawing up of pharmacopoeial standards, commonnames etc.,(c) functions relating to the monitoring of adversereactions,(d) corresponding functions relating to devices;There will also be a need for advice of a broader kind inconnection with matters of policy relating to the general purposes of the Act, on the pattern of expert committees, and on important technical points of principle not covered by any expert committee.A Commission,  to be known as the Medicines Commission, will&quot;be constituted - to advise the Ministers on matters of policyrelating to the general purposes of the Act,  to make recommenda-tions regarding the pattern of expert committees appropriate forgiving advice to the Ministers on functions or groups of functions referred to in broad terms in the preceding paragraphand on the committees&apos;  terms of reference, to advise the ministers or an expert committee, on a reference from either, on importanttechnical points of principle arising in connection with the licensing system and to undertake such other advisory functions as are not for the time being within the scope of an expert committee.   The Commission will be charged with consideringrepresentations from applicants for, or holders of, licences orclinical or field trial certificates who are aggrieved bya proposal of the licensing authority,  as a result7.
of advice received from an expert committee in relation to the safety or efficacy of the drug or to the adequacy of itsspecification to maintain its quality, to refuse, revoke orsuspend a licence or certificate.15.   The Commission will arrange for the preparation of the BritishPharmacopoeia or appoint a body (analogous to the BritishPharmacopoeia Commission) to do so.160    If the Commission wished, as it well might,  to recommend theappointment of separate expert committees for human drugs, forveterinary aspects and for devices it v/ould be able to do so.    Itwould be open to it to recommend to Ministers the names of per:sonsknowledgeable in the relevant field, whether members of theCommission itself or not, who would in the opinion of theCommission be suitable for appointment to particular expert commit-teeso   After considering the Commission&apos;s advice and consultingappropriate organisations the Ministers will set up expertcommittees undertaking functions or groups of functions.    the expert committees carrying out functions relating to safety andefficacy and specification of drugs, and relating to deviceswill advise the licensing authority direct in relation to the licensing or restriction on the sale or supply of particularproducts.17.   The Commission will not deal with non-medicinal aspects ofsubstances which are.controlled as drugs,    In relation to these the Poisons Boards of Great Britain and Northern Ireland willcontinue to discharge their present functions, advising the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Home Affairs respectively.8.
2 418.   The Commission will he kept to a reasonable size and heappointed by the Ministers after consultation with appropriateorganisationsc   Appointment will not be on a representationalbasis, because this would inevitably produce an unwieldy body,possibly without a proper balance of membership.    The organisa-tions to he consulted are expected to number 20 or more, amongstwhich are the Royal Colleges in England and Scotland (includingthe Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal college of Veterinary Surgeons), the General Medical and Dental Councils,the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, the Medical and agricultural Research Councils, the Royal Institute of Chemistry,British Medical, Dental and Veterinary Associations, theAssociation of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, theProprietary Association of Great Britain and the Association ofBritish Manufacturers of Agriculture Chemicals,19.   Accommodation and secretarial services and staff to enablethe Commission and any expert committee to carry out their functions will be provided,  and the Ministers will have powersto make provision in respect of any laboratory services requiredin connection with any of these functions.    In relation to thefunctions of the Commission or of an expert committee the staffin question will act in accordance with the instructions of theCommission or committee,9*
Drugs and Medical devices subject to control20o   The drugs concerned are substances and preparations for usein diagnosing, treating or preventing any ailment in man oranimal (including poultry and game birds) or in modifyingphysiological functions in man or animal, however administered.21 .   The medical devices concerned are articles capable of havingmechanical or physical, rather than chemical or biochemical,effect on the human or animal body, either by contact with oraction upon the body, intended for the prevention, diagnosis ortreatment of any ailment, or forming part of a piece of apparatuswhich has such an effect.22.   The controls will not, however, automatically apply tosubstances and articles marketed for mn-medicinal use even though they could be put to medicinal use.    But the Ministers will havepower by statutory instrument to list substances and articles ofthis kind which should be subject to control as medicines ormedical devices.    This method would be used to bring within thescope of the legislation, where expedient,  such products as toiletarticles, cosmetics, household disinfectants, antiseptics orsterilising agents not intended to be applied to the body, foodsand dietary supplements,  any of which may be used in connectionwith therapy or contain substances with therapeutic uses,  andalso articles used by patients themselves (e.g. diabetics) totake diagnostic tests.10.2 5
23.   Devices will be brought under control only gradually,.Those for human use most likely to be affected at a fairly early stage include(a) implants of metal or plastic (e.g. shunts, valves,synthetic arterial grafts, pacemakers),(b) equipment for the introduction or extraction of fluidsor substances into or from the human body (e.g.transfusion and perfusion equipment, syringes, cathetersdialysis systems, needles),(c) surgical dressings,(d) materials used in conservative orthodontic andprosthetic dentistry,(e) certain classes of items offered for sale as &quot;sterile&quot;cThe general framework for control in relation to safety andefficacy and quality will be provided by a licensing system,associated with independent professional advice from expertcommittees and the Medicines Commission.    This will supersede the licensing requirements of the Therapeutic Substances Act 1956 and part II of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1950, but not the licensing and registration provisions of the Drugs (Prevention ofMisuse) Act, 196I4. or the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1965? which are designed for a different purpose as safeguards against diversion of &amp;PUgs to illicit channels and against social evils resultingfrom abuse.
Licensing25.    Since safety,  efficacy and quality must &quot;be the samethroughout the United Kingdom it is envisaged that licensingwill he handled in one place where the advice of the expertcommittees can he most conveniently focussed.     Authority forlicensing will rest with the Health and Agriculture Ministers.26.   A licence will he required for the marketing,  importationor manufacture of,  or wholesale dealing in,  drugs, with appropriate requirements for each activity,  and in the caseof sale or supply for the purpose of clinical or field trial acertificate or some similar form of authority will he required,in order to ensure that appropriate toxicity testing has takenplace before the trial begins.27.   The marketing and importing licences will be the primarylicences that give the statutory backing to the safeguards of safety, efficacy and quality appropriate to particular drugs.A manufacturer^ licence will normally relate to facilities,equipment,  and expertise for the processes he is equipped tocarry out.      Before being able to manufacture a particular drughowever a manufacturer will need to hold a licence to marketthat drug or to manufacture for a person or company who holds one.28.   A manufacturing licence will however, not be requiredby a doctor or dentist to make up a preparation for one ofhis patients or by a veterinarian to make up a preparation foran animal, flock or herd for the treatment of which he is responsible.      A pharmacist too will not require a manufacturinglicence for dispensing a preparation.     All these practitionersare acting within their professional competence.      There willbe provision for other exemptions, for instance, for there-export of drugs exactly as they are imported,  or, inthe case of nurses and midwives, for breaking bulk and repackingof drugs in the course of their professional activities.12.
29.    The particulars to he supplied to the licensing authority in support of applications for marketing and importing licences,or for clinical or field trial certificates,  are expected to heon the lines of those now requested by the Committee on safety of Drugs or, in the case of veterinary drugs, by theVeterinary Sub-Committee of the Advisory Committee onPesticides and other Toxic Chemicals.    A primary licence ora clinical or field trial certificate would normally he issuedwhen the licensing authority is satisfied, on the basis ofthe particulars supporting the application,  that there are noconsiderations affecting the safety and efficacy of the drugin relation to the proposed claims, indications,  dosage orroute of administration, that in the light of current medical and scientific knowledge would justify its withholding fromsale or supply or from the proposed trial;    and that the standards for or the specification of the drug are adequate to produce a product of consistently satisfactory quality.In the sphere of safety and efficacy and specifications theservices of the expert committees will he most important.Efficacy by comparison with other drugs for the sameindication will not he a determining factor in relation to theissue of a licence.    Efficacy will he taken into account inrelation to the drug&apos;s toxicity,  and to the question whetherthe evidence supplied supports the claims to he made for thedrug.    The applicant must show that the conditions andpremises where the drug is to he manufactured, stored anddistributed (including arrangements for quality control) arelikely to be suitable for the production of a product complying with those standards or specifications.    In the case of amanufacturers licence, the applicant will have to show thathe has the capacity and facilities for carrying out the drugmanufacturing operations specified in the licence.   Wholesaledealers will have to show that the arrangements for the storage and distribution of the drugs covered by their licence13.
are likely to &quot;be adequate to maintain their quality untildelivered,,    It will he possible to include provisions in a licence or certificate in relation to safety, efficacy and quality, manufacturing premises, plant, equipment, lay-out,supervisory personnel,  and storage and distribution as appropriate.30.   Whenever the licensing authority issues a marketing orimporting licence the particulars, including attachedprovisions, will be notified to the appropriate expertcommitteec    This is an important safeguard, designed to secureflexibility of administration while providing for the expert committee opportunities to exercise their independentprofessional responsibility,,    It ensures that the safety andefficacy committee is aware of all new drugs and formulationsbeing put on the market.    It would be entitled to call for and review the data received from the applicant,  and if it thought fit, recommend a variation of the attached conditions or the revocation of the licence,    In practice it is most unlikely thata licence for a drug with a new principle   would be issuedwithout prior reference to the committee&quot;,31.    It will not be practicable to license all existing drugsbefore the licensing system for new drugs and formulationsstarts.    There will therefore be temporary provisions toenable products effectively on the market before the appointed day for the beginning of licensing of new drugs to continue without a licence until they con be brought under the licensing scheme later.    It is envisaged that after thatlater date licences for such products would first be given as of right on the furnishing of relatively simple particulars of identification.Variations32,   A licence will remain valid only as long as the particulars supporting the application remain relevant.Variation of licence conditions might follow an application1h.
from the holder or might he the result of a reviewinitiated by the licensing authority.Refusal, revocation or suspension33.    It is envisaged that a licence or certificate (other than an initial licence of right) may be refused and any licence orcertificate may be revoked or temporarily suspended if, after taking account of advice from the Commission or the appropriateexpert committee, it appears that the considerations Inparagraph 29 are not, or are no longer, satisfied, or thatthe specification of the drug is not, or could no longer beregarded as,  satisfactory.3k.    Refusal, revocation or suspension of a licence orcertificate will also be permissible on a number of other grounds, e.g. if the character of the product no longeraccorded with the particulars which formed the basis of thelicence or if the particulars were found to be false, or ifany licensing conditions were not complied with,  or if theconditions of manufacture, storage or distribution were found to be inadequate to maintain the quality of the drugor device.35.   Where the grounds, for a proposed refusal, revocation orsuspension of a licence (as described in paragraph 33) involvethe exercise    of professional judgment in relation to safety,efficacy or specification, prior reference of the case for advice to the appropriate expert committee would be obligatory,subject to the possibility,  in the case of a licence-holder, ofa temporary suspension meantime if there    appeared to beimminent serious risk.     Where the committee gives adviceadverse to the    applicant or licence-holder, the licensing authority before issuing its formal, decision will notify him and r;ive him the opportunity of making representations to theMedicines Commission.      In certain cases the applicant orlicence-holder may be given   a further right to   be heard by15 o
the licensing authority.     If the latter   formally refuses orrevokes   the licence   it must give a reasoned decision and   theapplicant or licence-holder would have a   right of appeal   ona point of law to the High Court in England and Wales and thecorresponding Courts of Scotland and Northern Ireland.     A rightto he heard by the licensing authority,  to a reasoned decision,and to appeal   on a point of law to the High Court etc, wouldalso attach to a proposed refusal,  suspension or revocation on   thegrounds mentioned   in paragraph 31+.36.    Licences and certificates are to have a limited period ofvalidity and he renewable, but not transferable.      If    a drug isnot   marketed within two years of being licensed the licence couldbe revoked;    a decision to withdraw a drug from the market orfrom clinical   or field trial would also have to be notified.Fees37..    The licensing authority will be authorised to charge fees inconnection with applications for licences or certificates or fortheir variation, and for the issue of any document for presentation by an exporter to the appropriate authority of a country other than the United Kingdom certifying the status onthe United Kingdom market of particular products or whether theyhave been licensed for export.Confidentiality38.    There will be provision on the lines of that in the Poodand Drugs Acts for securing the confidentiality of information supplied to the licensing authority or the committees, apart frommatters where disclosure is necessary for the purpose of enforcement.General39*    In these licensing proposals the experience of the Committeeon Safe ty of Drugs during the past -three years has been heavilydrawn upon.     The introduction of a statutory licensing system with sanctions necessarily involved making detailed requirements,mainly in subordinate legislation, with regard to particulars to&quot;be supplied, the conditions to be satisfied, licensing conditions and the circumstances in which licences can be refused or revoked,but the intention is to retain the flexible administration thathas been so effective under the voluntary scheme,^-0o   The expert advisory committees that will be associated withthe licensing scheme and will succeed the Committee on Safety of16.
Drugs, the statutory advisory committee under the TherapeuticSubstances Act, 1956,  and the Veterinary Sub-Committee of theAdvisory Committee on Pesticides and other Toxic Chemicals v/illbe broadly comparable in character and their secretariat andthe licensing staff will be integrated.     Applications, thoughtechnically made to the licensing authority, would be handled bystaff serving the expert committees, and there is no reason whycommunications between them and the staff of applicants shouldnot be as flexible as they have been under the voluntary systemor why applications should be handled any less expeditiously thansubmissions to the existing committee.     Any legislation must provide for offences, legal proceedings and penalties, but withthe co-co-operation and mutual confidence that the Government expects to be a feature of the operation of the new system legal proceedings should be exceptional.     Thus it would still bepossible to ask firms to consider withdrawing an application ora product from the market if safety considerations made it advisable, without formal rejection in the first case or issuinga mandatory revocation in the second (though  a voluntarywithdrawal would be followed by an amendment of the licence),41.    In relation to quality control in manufacture the aim of thenew provisions is to ensure that essential quality checks,  suchas are now the regular practice of the best manufacturers, willbe built into the manufacturing process by all.     The traditionalreliance, now 100 years old, on the testing of samples taken in aretailer&apos;s premises to see whether they are &quot;of the nature substanceor quality demanded by the purchaser&quot; cannot ensure this.Retail sale and supply^of drugs^2.   The present law relating to the retail sale and supply of drugs is far from comprehensive in its scope or application.Its starting point is the assumption, now clearly inadequatein relation to modern drugs,  that drugs are ordinary commodities,whose sale can take place anywhere and be left to the ordinary commercial pressures of the market except for a few where there are risks of accident or abuse, criminal misuse, or risks to the17.
community as a whole,  and consequently that safeguards need onlybe applied to a limited list of substances.43.   This basis however takes too little heed of the risks forthe individual inherent in uncontrolled medication with moderndrugs.     The marketing every year of several scores of new and often potent drugs has in fact led many pharmaceuticalmanufacturers of their own volition to market many modern drugsonly through pharmacies.     The reason is that they are primarilyintended to be supplied on a practitioner&apos;s advice and a pharmacyis a business which sets out to sell a wide range of drugs andmedicines under the supervision of a pharmacist,  speciallyqualified to exercise a proper professional discretion over thesale and supply of drugs to the public.     For historical reasonsretail pharmacies are known to the law as registered premises ofan authorised, seller of poisons.      It is time the law began to usemore appropriate expressions,  such as &quot;registered pharmacies&quot;and &quot;persons authorised to conduct a pharmacy&quot;,  and to reflect the fact that drugs and medicines are not ordinary commodities, except for defined ranges that are suitable for self-medication by the public or for use by owners of animals,  shouldbe sold only at premises where a pharmacist is in charge, orby a doctor, dentist or veterinarian.      &quot;Authorised sellerof poisons&quot; will in future relate to sellers of non-medicinalpoisons.hk*   As, however,  the conditions that now need to he satisfied to&quot;sell poisons&quot; (Sections 8-11A of the Pharmacy and PoisonsAct, 1933 and corresponding provisions in Northern Ireland) arein general appropriate to selling a full range of drugs itis intended to carry them over with few modifications.     the registration authority for pharmacies in Great Britain willcontinue to he the Pharmaceutical Society and in NorthernIreland the appropriate Government Department.     The provisionsof section 19 of the Pharmacy Act,  195k, and corresponding18.
provisions in Northern Ireland, regulating the use of titles,- emblems and descriptions such as &quot;pharmacy&quot;, &quot;pharmaceuticalHfchemist&quot;, &quot;dispensing chemist&quot;, will need to he aligned to thenew situation.I4.5.   In addition to persons authorised to conduct a pharmacy,who will, ipso facto, he able to sell veterinary drugs at&apos; registered pharmacies, a new class of &quot;authorised sellers ofveterinary drugs&quot;, who will need to he registered by the: appropriate Agriculture Minister, will be defined in respect of retail dealing in those veterinary drugs, which, though not limitedto sale or supply on prescription, are unsuitable for generalsale.i ij.6.   Doctors and dentists will be able to sell or supply drugsto their patients or to a person having the care of suchpatients, and a veterinarian will be able to do so to a personhaving the care of an animal, flock or herd under treatment byI kl*   Retail sale of drugs to the public will, with some important- exceptions, be limited to registered pharmacies.    The exceptions\ will permit prepacked drugs for human use listed by the ministers for general sale to be sold at any shop.   Prepacked veterinaryH drugs not restricted to veterinary prescription could be sold atI places other than shops, but (unless listed for general sale)only by authorised sellers of veterinary drugs (also, of course,at a pharmacy)a   Animal feeding stuffs manufacturers will also  be able to sell or supply veterinary drugs to farmers mixed withanimal feeding stuffs in accordance with a prescription from aveterinarian for the treatment of a particular animal, flockor herd.    (This does not of course detract from a feeding stuffsp manufacturer&apos;s right to mix other drugs and feeding stuffs byH Virtue of holding a manufacturers licence).
ij.8.   Ordinary counter-sales of herbal remedies which do not contain drugs restricted to prescription will be permissibleoutside registered pharmacies at a shop and provided that theyare produced solely by drying, crushing or comminuting plants(but not by using any other process except tablet making, pillmaking or compressing), or are a mixture of such a product and water.    In addition, herbal remedies, by whatever process they havebeen made up could be supplied at the premises on which they havebeen made up if they are being directly sold or supplied to an individual who has gone there for treatment;    and in thesecircumstances a licence would not be required for the process ofmaking up.h9.   The drugs on general sale will be listed in orders made bythe Health Ministers (in the case of veterinary drugs jointly with the Agriculture Ministers), having taken account of anyadvice from the appropriate expert committee.    They will be drugsYifhere the hazard to health, the risk of misuse, or the need totake special precaution in handling is small and where widersale would be a convenience to the purchaser.50.   The Health Ministers (in the case of veterinary drugs jointly with the Agriculture Ministers), will need powers to list instatutory orders drugs or classes of drugs to be sold or suppliedonly by, or on a prescription from, a doctor, dentist orveterinarian.   For certain exceptional categories of specifieddrugs sale or supply could be only by doctors, dentists orveterinarians specially authorised in relation to such categories of drugs, where the sale or supply is for the purpose of treatment&quot;by or in accordance with their directions;    or only at pharmacies,under the authority of a prescription from such a practitioner.This provision is intended to apply only to radioactive drugs and tosuch other drugs as may be listed in regulations, the Ministers20.
being obliged first to obtain and take account of the advice of the appropriate expert committee, as justifying exceptionalsafeguards such as special technical knowledge on the part ofthe prescriber.51.    It is also contemplated that it should be possible to require that in the course of distribution certain categories of drugsare sold only to persons entitled to sell them to others, and toregulate the circumstances in which samples of drugs on the generalsale list, herbal remedies etc. might be distributed to thepublic.52o   Ancillary regulations would relate to various matters, suchas supervision of dispensing by a pharmacist, the safe keepingof drugs, and the keeping of records.53.    The Health Ministers (in the case of veterinary drugsjointly with the Agriculture Ministers) will have power by statutory instrument to prohibit the sale or supply of a drug.Except when a temporary prohibition should take effect immediately because of apparent serious risk to health, theMinisters will be required first to obtain and consider theadvice of the appropriate expert committee.5k.   Provisions similar in effect to, and in substitution for,those in the Pood and Drugs Acts relating to the adulterationof drugs, the sale, advertisement, etc. of adulterated drugs,and the protection of purchasers in relation to the nature and quality of the drug demanded will be included.    The legislation will make provision for securing compliance with the standardslaid down in monographs in the British Pharmacopoeia, the BritishPharmaceutical Codex, the British Veterinary Codex, the EuropeanPharmacopoeia, or of any future &quot;official&quot; compendium (i.e,prepared under the aegis of the Medicines Commission).21.
Cleanliness and hygiene55.   There is in the present law no provision relating tothe observance of sanitary conditions, cleanliness and otherproper practices in connection with the keeping, transportation,sale and supply of drugs, (and, if necessary, devices), orfor the treatment and disposal of any drugs that are found tobe defective or unfit for sale or supply.    This will be remediedby regulations enforceable in courts of summary jurisdiction.In serious cases the Court will be given power, analogous topowers now existing in England and Wales in relation to foodpremises, to make an order disqualifying the use of thesepremises or place of sale for the sale of drugs for a period of up to two years;    there will be powers of similar effect inrelation to Scotland and Northern Ireland.Devices56.   The sale and supply of devices would not be associated withregistered pharmacies or other premises in the way proposed fordrugs.    But powers will be sought under which devices could berequired to comply with standards in the British Pharmacopoeia orother compendia, and the sale or supply of specified devices couldbe restricted to prescription and by persons authorised to sellor supply such devices, or prohibited altogether.-22.*
Labelling, description and identification57.   The labels of the immediate containers of drugs and ofouter packages and any accompanying leaflets or packageinserts will be subject to requirements under regulationsthat would make it possible to require a label to containspecified information, which should also be reproduced inany accompanying leaflet.58.    The labelling requirements will vary in content and range according to the description or class of drug and thecircumstances in which it is sold or supplied.   For instance,the name of the licence holder, particulars of the composition of the drug, directions for use and any necessary warningsor precautions would normally have to be shown in all cases,together with any special labelling requirements under thelicence.    Information about other matters, for instance,potency, or the date of manufacture or expiry, will benecessary only for certain groups of drugs.    The normal requirements would be capable of being modified to dealwith the practical problems arising in relation to dispensedmedicines or where the supply is in small containers, suchas injectable materials made up in single dose containers.Soluble containers, such as capsules, would be regarded aspart of the drug itself.    The regulations could cover theform or manner of labelling, so as to ensure that the specified information was given due prominence.    There isno intention of preventing due prominence being given toa trade name059.   The sale, supply or possession for the purposes of sale or supply, of any drug (including samples) bearing a labelwhich falsely described the drug or is calculated tomislead as to its nature, substance, quality, effects orthe purposes for which it is intended to be used or ought not23 c
to be used will be prohibited.    Similar provisions will apply to any leaflet intended to accompany a drug.    Therewould be a defence where a person could not reasonably have ascertained that the label or leaflet in question was of such a character.   A &quot;third party&quot; defence on the linesof that provided for in the Pood and Drugs Acts would beavailable where me false or misleading labelling was the fault of a third party, and not of the person selling or supplying the drug.60.   Requirements could be made with respect to the characterof containers (for instance, their strength, or the material to be used for particular types of drugs) and theiridentification (for instance, by colour, special markings orshapes, such as vertical fluting) and with respect to identifyingrequirements for particular drugs or categories of drugs(e.g. by colour, or shape or by bearing distinctive identifyingmarkings) .61.   The publication, or display by any means, includingradio or television of advertisements or making of oralstatements calculated to promote the use of a drug, whichfalsely describe it or are likely to mislead as to its nature, quality, indications, contra-indications, or effectsassociated with its use, or which make claims going beyond those covered by the provisions of the licence will heprohibited;    and since the licensing provisions bear on the[primary licence holder the initiation of advertisementswithout his authority would he prohibited.    There would be a defence where any person could not reasonably haveascertained that the advertisement or statement was of the^character described above;    or that, being a person whose2h.
CO EVIDENTIAL1 business it is to publish or arrange the publication of advertisements, he received the advertisement for publication in the ordinary course of business.62.   The Ministers will be able to make regulations specifyingdrugs or classes of dru^s all advertising of which will(subject to stated exceptions) be prohibited, or specifyingparticular purposes for which (again subject to stated exceptionsdrugs should not be advertised, or specifying particularexpressions which should not be used in advertisements labelsor leaflets, if in their view such a prohibition would be inthe interests of the health or safety of the public.63.   These regulations will replace and extend, as necessary,for reasons of safety or public health, existing provisionsprohibiting advertisements for remedies for venereal diseases,cancer and other serious diseases listed in the Pharmacyand Medicines Act, 1941 and the corresponding statutory provision in Northern Ireland.    The exceptions would permitpromotional information to be directed to special groups suchas the medical and pharmaceutical professions.Requirements could also be made with respect to the content,format and manner of presentation of advertisements for drugs.The object is to ensure that those to whom the advertisementis directed are given adequate information about the drug.The range of information to be given would vary according tothe nature of the drug, the medium being used for theadvertisement and the type of person (e.g. professional orlay) to whom it is addressed.65.   Provision will be made so as to secure that before adrug is promoted to a doctor,  dentist or veterinarian by25.
m direct mailing or by medical representatives he must have i tjeen provided by the promoter within a specified period beforehand (in order to ensure that it is up to date) withan objective summary, probably in the form of a standard size of data sheet, of essential reference particulars about the:; i dru(i conforming to provisions in the licence.66.   The licensing authority would be able to call for copiesof advertising material and data cards which were being used,or had been used within the specified period.;   67.   Provisions relating to the labelling or advertising ofi devices would be similar in scope to those for drugs, butspecific requirements would be applicable only to specifieddevices or classes of device.The British Pharmacopoeia and other compendia6G.   The responsibility for the publication and keeping up todate of the British Pharmacopoeia will be transferred from thei General Medical Council to the Health Ministers,,    It is envisaged that the work of the British Pharmacopoeia Commission will becarried on by the Medicines Commission or by an expert committee set up on their advice.    Other &quot;official&quot; compendia could beprepared under their aegis and published in the same way, andthe Agriculture Ministers could have corresponding powers to publish on the veterinary side.    Within the scope of the BritishPharmacopoeia and other future official compendia will bedescriptions of, standards for, or other notes on, drugs, deyices,and certain other articles.69.   It is not intended to prohibit the publication by other bodies of similar compendia, such as the present BritishPharmaceutical Codex or the British Veterinary Codex, but asthe scope of the compendia prepared under the aegis of theCommission widens, the scope of other compendia might diminish.Provision will also be made to fulfil international obligationsthat require the United Kingdom Government to secure that agreedmonographs (for instance those to be included in the EuropeanPharmacopoeia, to which the European Pharmacopoeia Conventionapplies) are adopted as official standards in the U.K.jftforc ement7p&apos;   The Ministers, whose duty it will be to secure adequateenforcement of the Bill will enforce parts of it directly.   Whereenforcement is made the duty of other bodies, Ministers will havepuch reserve powers as may be necessary.26.
71.   The measures on which reliance will chiefly he placed forsecuring adequate quality control of drugs or devices will heapplied by the central Departments through the licensing scheme,at the stage of marketing, manufacture or wholesale dealing.Checks at the retain stage will still be required and sampling atall stages will need to be co-ordinated.    In relation to samplingat the retail stage for analysis and the enforcement at the retail[stage of the relevant provisions relating to composition, labellingand description, including advertising, they could arrange for the[pharmaceutical Society or the local authorities who are now responsible for enforcing the composition   labelling and descriptionJprovisions in the Pood and Drugs Acts (at present known as &quot;food and drugs authorities&quot;), to have the duty of enforcing them locally.It is contemplated that the initial arrangement in Great Britainfwould be for the Pharmaceutical Society to enforce these provisionsfat registered pharmacies, and possibly in relation to authorisedIsellers of veterinary drugs, and for &quot;food and drugs authorities&quot;I(the county or county borough health authorities in Northern Ireland)1 to enforce them in relation to other premises and places (i.e. whereonly &quot;general sale list&quot; drugs may be sold or supplied).    The initialfarrangements could be reviewed from time to time, e.g. in the eventof major changes in the pattern of English local authorities&apos; func-tions arising out of the current review by the Royal Commission on local Government.172.   It seems right to confer responsibility for localenforcement of provisions relating to cleanliness and hygieneat shops, premises and other places where retail dealing takes place (except registered pharmacies and places where an^authorised seller of veterinary drugs is functioning) on the1 local authorities who enforce food hygiene provisions.    Many[of the premises concerned would also be food premises, towhich food hygiene requirements apply;    the provisions inRelation to drugs would not be more exacting than those27-
cable to food premises.   At pharmacies and in the case ofuthorised sellers of veterinary drugs where in both cases more-oecialised requirements are likely to be required, especially.n relation to storage, and, in the former case, the dispensary,,he responsibility for enforcement would be with the appropriate[ministers with possibilities of delegation.    Because of practicaliroblems arising in relation to vehicles the application of the&quot;equirements to premises and to the transportation of drugs maylave to be effected on a rather different basis.    EnforcementIn relation to civilian hospitals and similar institutions and in relation to practitioners will not be delegated.3,   The Pharmaceutical Society in Great Britain and theppropriate Government Department in Northern Ireland would behe enforcing authority for the registration of pharmacies,he use of unauthorised titles, etc., and the provisionsegulating the sale and supply of drugs by retail.    In Greatritain the Society has been responsible for a very long time fornforcing analogous provisions under the Pharmacy and Poisonscts, and it is appropriate that the professional body shouldndertake this task.k*   Provisions requisite for the purposes of enforcing the Billill be included, for instance, right of entry and inspection,he procuring, by purchase or on reasonable payment, of samples,he production of appropriate books and documents, the seizure andolding of articles liable to forfeit under the Bill and documentselating to them which may be required in proceedings.   Wherelorresponding provisions exist in the Pood and Drugs Acts, whichre already applicable to drugs and are familiar to localthorities and retailers, they will in most cases be an appropriatsis for these provisions.*   Samples procured by a &quot;food and drugs Authority&quot; (the countycounty borough health authority in Northern Ireland) would,28.
as now, be submitted, to the public analyst for the area in whichthey were procured.    Samples procured on behalf of a GovernmentDepartment or the Pharmaceutical Society might be submitted foranalysis or other examination to any laboratory that appears to theappropriate Minister to be qualified to carry out these functions.The Health or Agriculture Ministers would be able to make provisionfor such laboratory services and facilities as appear to themrequisite in connection with any of their functions under the Bill.This would enable a Minister to make arrangements with a publicanalyst or with any &quot;food and drugs authority&quot; for samples to be examined by the analyst or at the authority&apos;s laboratory on suchpayment as may be agreed, or to provide any necessary centrallaboratory facilities.Legal Proceedings76.   A requirement to give Ak days&apos; notice to the appropriate-Minister of forthcoming proceedings by the Pharmaceutical Societyor a &quot;food and drugs authority&quot; (the county or county borough health authority in Northern Ireland) in relation to composition, labellingor description would give the Minister the opportunity to make suggestions for avoiding multiple prosecutions in respect of thesame drug or article.    This will not apply in Scotland whereprosecutions, in accordance with the normal practice, will be theIresponsibility of the appropriate criminal authority.    In additionto imposing penalties,  the court would be able to order the forfeit[of any article in relation to or by means of which a proved offencewas committed,   A &quot;third party defence&quot; will be made available inAppropriate cases.Other provisions77.   These would include a provision relating to compensation for loss or diminution of emoluments to local government officers-n relation to changes in the functions of their employing authorityland to employees of the General Medical Council engaged on thejpritish Pharmacopoeia in consequence of any discontinuance of such work following the transfer of the General Medical Council&apos;sobligation to the Ministers.29.
78,   Before making regulations (other than those broadlyreproducing existing regulations)  the Ministers will be obliged to consult such organisations as appear to themappropriate as being representative of the interestssubstantially affected.79.   A good many of the detailed provisions described above will be in statutory regulations, because circumstances maynecessitate the requirements to be varied.   As in alllegislation of this kind applying to activities of almostinfinite variation the enabling powers must be wide if thecomplexities of manufacture, sale and supply are to be properly covered.    The Ministers&apos;  intention is not toimpede the industry unnecessarily or to hamper doctors,dentists, veterinarians or pharmacists in the practice oftheir professions.    The flexibility of the powers is intendedto meet the wide variety of circumstances that can arise.The Ministers are confident that the effect of the legislation will be to enhance the standing of our pharmaceutical industryand that it will operate to the benefit of the consumer,irrespective of whether he is supplied under the National HealService cr not.80.   It is the Governments expectation, judging by thegeneral tenor of the observations received on the earlier proposals, that legislation on the lines now to beintroduced will command widespread support030.
