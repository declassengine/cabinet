REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON MINISTERIALPUBLICATIONNote by the Lord chancellor circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet the attached report of the Committee on Ministerial Publication which wasappointed in February 1967 to consider &quot; the rules and conventionsgoverning the Ministerial use of official material otherwise than for current official purposes; and to make recommendations for any changes in these rules and conventions which appear to be requiredin order to maintain the principles of confidentiality and collective responsibility in the conduct of Government business&quot;. TheCommittee&apos;s conclusions and recommendations are summarised inparagraphs 23 and 24 and the guidance which we recommend shouldbe given to Ministers is set out in Annex B in the form of an additionalsection to be added to the memorandum &quot; Questions of Procedure for ministers &quot; (C (P) (66) 5).The Committee&apos;s recommendations are unanimous, except onthe question, discussed in paragraphs 14 to 16, whether ministers should be asked to give an undertaking to accept, after discussion,any requests which the Secretary of the Cabinet thinks it necessary tomake for the deletion or alteration of passages in the manuscript oftheir memoirs.I invite the Cabinet to come to a conclusion on this question and to approve the recommendations in paragraph 24 of the Report.G.House of Lords, S.W.1,1st September, 1967.REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON MINISTERIALPUBLICATIONIntroduction1. The Cabinet agreed on 26th January, 1967, that it would bedesirable to study the present conventions about the publication ofmemoirs by Ministers (CC (67) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 1).

direction of the Prime Minister a Committee under the chairmanship of the Lord Chancellor consisting of the Home Secretary, theMinister without Portfolio (Mr. Gordon Walker) and the Attorney-General were appointed on 14th February with the following termsof reference:&quot; To consider the rules and conventions governing the ministerial use of official material otherwise than for currentofficial purposes; and to make recommendations for any changesin these rules and conventions which appear to be required inorder to maintain the principles of confidentiality and collective responsibility in the conduct of Government business&quot;.The Lord Privy Seal was added to the Committee on 5th May.2. Section I of our report deals with the question of principle:is it necessary that restraints should be placed on the freedom ofMinisters and junior Ministers to publish accounts of their experience in office either in memoirs or in other work? We think that somerestraints are necessary. We consider in Section II the restraintsimposed by the law, which we regard as ineffective except in relationto disclosure of important secrets. In Section III we consider theexisting practice and conventions on the publication of memoirs andother work, the arrangements for the clearance of manuscripts andthe custody of documents, and we make recommendations on how these conventions should be clarified and operated. Section IVsummarises our conclusions and recommendations.I.   SHOULD RESTRAINTS BE OBSERVED IN THEPUBLICATION OF MINISTERIAL MEMOIRS?3. We think it would be generally agreed that some reticenceis necessary about the conduct by a Government of their day-to-daybusiness, but with this we are not concerned. We are concernedwith the point where day-to-day business passes into history; and here the interests of history and those of Government appear to bein conflict. The personal recollections of the participants in affairsare the stuff of which history is made. They convey the reality ofthe political life of a period as no collection of official documents canby its nature do. Official documents are by design and intentionobjective, factual, impersonal; but the historian is concerned notmerely with facts and events, but with the reaction to them of thepeople who carried the responsibility for Government. He needstheir subjective account of how matters appeared to them, of howaffairs were in fact handled and how the inter-action of personalitiesand opinions, the tension between conflict and loyalty, influenced the determination of a Government^ policy.4. Our system of Government on the Cabinet model, with itsdoctrine of collective responsibility, is concerned, on the other hand,to maintain a structure of custom and convention which will containfissiparous tendencies and enable a group of people to reconcile theirinevitable differences on incidentals so as to direct their energies tothe achievement of a common purpose on fundamentals.   It is
essential to this end that Ministers should be able to enjoy &quot; absolutefrankness in private relations aud full discussion of all matters ofcommon interest. . . . Decisions freely arrived at should be loyallysupported and considered as decisions of the whole Government&quot;(Joseph Chamberlain). Or, as Gladstone put it, &quot;in Cabinetdifferences of view can be stated and if need be argued and thenadvisedly surrendered with a view to a common conclusion &quot;. this implies a high degree of confidence and mutual trust amongstcolleagues in the Government; for Ministers will not feel free todiscuss frankly and to surrender their personal and departmentalpreferences to the achievement of a common view, nor can theyreasonably be expected to abide 1)$ a common decision, if they know that the stand they have taken ayd the points they have surrenderedwill sooner rather than later become public knowledge. If the soundness of Cabinet government depends on this mutual confidence,its basis can be eroded by the disclosure of what has passed withinthe confidential relationship.5. But these considerations do not require silence to be observed for ever; the question arises at what interval from eventsdisclosure of what kinds ceases to be harmful. This is largely amatter of judgment; and while the disclosure of the course of discussion at any one Cabinet meeting, or s.i frank account of the relations ofany one former Minister with his colleagues in the Government maynot do much harm, except perhaps to the feelings of those concerned,if it became the practice for disclosure to be made while those concerned were still active in political life and the issues betweenthem were still a matter of lively controversy, the frankness essentialto relationships among serving Ministers might well be destroyed.6. The problem, then, is to strike a tolerable balance betweenthe degree and nature of disclosure and the length of time that has elapsed since the events, bearing in mind that, if restraints are tootight and the periods too long, much of the valuable raw material ofpolitical history, and hence of our accumulated political experience,may cease to be produced; while, if the periods are too short and therestraints ineffective, memoir writing will in time change the system which it prematurely records.II.  THE BACKGROUND OF LAW7. The law affecting publication by Ministers and related matters may be summarised as follows:(a) The Official Secrets A ctsThe Official Secrets Acts forbid any person who has had inhis possession, or has had access to, any note, document or information by reason of holding office under Her Majesty or has had such note, document or information entrusted to him in confidence by a person holding such office:(i) to communicate the document or information to anyperson other than one to whom he is authorised to8233
)communicate it or Ho whom it is in the interests ofthe State his duty &apos;to communicate it; or(ii) to retain it when he has no right to retain it or to fail to comply with the directions of a lawfulauthority to return^ it.It is an offence for a person to whom a document or information is communicated to receive it if he knows or hasreasonable ground to believe, that the communication was in contravention of the Acts, unless he can show that it was communicated to him againstj; his wishes.These provisions apply to information passed orally and to copies of documents, diary entries or tape recordings containingsuch information. A Minister or former Minister who publishesinformation which he has obtained by reason of office may becommitting a criminal offence; unless he has been authorised to disclose the information, as may a publisher who receivesinformation, the disclosure of v/hich he knows to be unauthorised.A former Minister who without authority retains possession ofan official document may also be committing an offence. Theconsent of the Attorney-General, or, in Scotland, the lord advocate, is required under &quot;the Acts before a prosecution canbe instituted. The principal considerations which he wouldtake into account would be the possible damage to national security or to international relations caused by an unauthorised disclosure, whether the Government had had an opportunity of preventing disclosure, whether the information was harmlessbecause of the lapse of time since its origin, and whether itwas the current practice to authorise Ministers or formerMinisters to make similar disclosures.(b) Common LawThe High Court may grant an injunction to restrain aperson who has obtained information through a fiduciary and confidential relationship with another person from disclosingthat information without authority. Ministers have a confidential relationship with the Crown: and, although thepoint has never been tested, we think that the court couldgrant an injunction to prevent a Minister or former minister from publishing without authority information obtained byreason of his office and that they could similarly restrain, forexample, a publisher. The fiduciary relationship which is thebasis of this jurisdiction does not depend on the PrivyCounsellor^ oath, the legal (as distinct from the moral) forceof which may be in some doubt. The foregoing refers to thecommon law of England, but in Scotland the common lawposition is very similar.(c) Public Records ActSection 5 of the Public Records Act 1958 provides thatdocuments deposited in the Public Records Office in Londonshall not (with some exceptions) be available for public
inspection until they have been in existence for a stated period which, after the end of 1967, will be 30 years or such otherperiod as the Lord Chancellor may, in particular cases, direct.A similar rule is observed by practice in the case of documentsdeposited in the Scottish Record Office in Edinburgh. If therewere a disclosure after that period of information contained in a document deposited in either of these Offices, it could not besaid to be a breach of the Official Secrets Acts or of thefiduciary relationship with the Crown, because disclosure would,by implication, have been authorised.8. While the prohibitions in the Official Secrets Acts apply to ministers and former Ministers as to others, they are for practical purposes enforceable against them only in the event of disclosureor threatened disclosure of material damaging either to national security or to other important national interests. To takeproceedings in other circumstances might well do more harm thanit would prevent, since the public would be liable to suspect thatthe Government of the day were trying to conceal some politicalscandal or otherwise to save themselves from embarrassment.Proceedings by way of application for an injunction would be almost equally unattractive. The fact that they had been broughtwould inevitably become known, while their substance would remainsecret, thus intensifying public suspicion and ensuring a readymarket for the book if the author decided to publish in another country.III.   THE PRESENT CONVENTIONS9. In the past reliance has been placed on convention ratherthan on the formal provisions of the law. This appears to be partly because of the limited practical efficacy of the legal prohibitions,partly because the legal prohibitions are so wide that they cannot be interpreted literally in their application to Ministers, whose wholeofficial life is concerned with the receipt of information which isformally covered by the Acts although much of it is trivial. reliance on convention also derives partly, we think, from the fact that muchof the material which it would be undesirable for Ministers to publish prematurely does not consist in any literal sense ofinformation, secret or otherwise, which has come to them as ministers: it consists of the record of their own observation andassessment of their colleagues&apos; opinions, policies, strengths andweaknesses as experienced in the close personal relationships towhich colleagues in the Government are inevitably committed.Premature publication of this type of material may be damaging not because the material is in its essence secret, but because of theposition of the author. Publication by a former member of aGovernment may be a breach of the confidence which cabinet government requires, as we indicate in paragraph 4, to subsist betweenMinisterial colleagues. The material acquires its secret charactermainly because it is concerned with that relationship.   From this
point of view the premature publication of domestic details aboutthe inner life of a Government with its changing balance of opinion and influence might be no less damaging than publication ofinformation about our relations with a foreign Power; and theconvention therefore relies less on law than on a sense of what is right and proper.10. We have been informed that the present conventions areas set out in Annex A. They deal not only with publication byformer Ministers of autobiographical and other work, but with access to official records for autobiographical purposes; with the surrenderand removal of official documents when leaving office; and with the safeguarding of official papers already in private collections. Wethink that they are too imprecise in some particulars and that they need to be supplemented on certain matters with which they do notat present deal. We comment on these points in what follows.General11. We think it is not made sufficiently clear to Ministers thatthe Official Secrets Acts apply to them, as to others who acquireinformation in their official capacity, but that they may be able toobtain authority for the publication of information which might otherwise be regarded as covered by the Acts. They should also bemade aware of the considerations which, apart from the law, require a proper degree of reticence from those who have sharedresponsibility for government. For both reasons a former minister who intends to publish a book dealing with or derived from his own experience as a member of the Government, should give notice ofhis intention and endeavour to obtain authority for publication.We recommend that a statement to this effect should be given to anew Minister (including junior Ministers) on taking office and shouldbe embodied, with a statement of the whole body of relevantconventions, in the memorandum &quot; Questions of Procedure for ministers&quot; which is circulated at the beginning of every new administration. The current edition is C (P) (66) 5. We attach as annex B a proposed new section.Publication and clearance of manuscripts12. We recommend that Ministers and former Ministers should send manuscripts disclosing information or repeating knowledgegained as Ministers (whether purely autobiographical or not) to theSecretary of the Cabinet before the work is set up in print. We furtherrecommend that this rule should be reinforced by requiring ministers on taking office to sign a document:(i) acknowledging that the Official Secrets Acts apply to them;(ii) undertaking that when they leave office they will not carryaway any official documents, defined as administrative and departmental records belonging to Her Majesty*except, with the permission of the Secretary of the Cabinet,* Public Records Act, 1958, Schedule 1, paragraph 2(1).
copies of papers (other than those classified &quot; TOPSECRET &quot;) with which they have had a particularly closepersonal association;(iii) undertaking to submit appropriate manuscripts to theSecretary of the Cabinet as above.When a Minister leaves office this document should be produced tohim as a reminder of his undertakings and of the facilities availableto him for obtaining authority for the publication of materialotherwise covered by the Official Secrets Acts and for the removalof copies of departmental papers with which he has been particularlyclosely associated (see paragraph 18).13. We have been unable to reach agreement on whether to add to the document a further point, namely an undertaking to accept any suggestions the Secretary of the Cabinet may make for deletionor amendment of a manuscript. Three of us considered that thisshould not be included; two that it should. We are agreed that thepurpose of the submission of manuscript is threefold: to secureformal authority for the publication of material the unauthorisedpublication of which would be a breach of the Official Secrets Acts;to enable the author to be warned if what he proposes to publishwould endanger security (which he may not himself be in a positionto judge); and to give an opportunity for the author&apos;s attention tobe drawn to passages which appear to be in breach of the conventions and to the harm which their publication may do to our system ofgovernment and to public confidence in it. We are also agreed,having considered various alternatives (for example, an all-partygroup of Privy Counsellors or a committee consisting of the PrimeMinister of the day, his predecessor(s) in office, the Attorney-Generaland the Leader of the Opposition), that the appropriate person toconsider manuscripts is the Secretary of the Cabinet. He serves notonly the Government in office, but successive Governments. He istherefore well suited to discharge a responsibility for the continuingsoundness of the system of government under which each successiveAdministration operates and for the observance of the conventionswhich safeguard it. He is in a position to consult (and advise) boththe Prime Minister of the day and the Prime Minister of theGovernment in which the author served; and he can ensure that anyharm which publication might involve either to security or currentinternational relations is assessed by the appropriate departments.Our disagreement is on the question whether a former Minister shouldbe required to accept proposals put to him by the Secretary of theCabinet for the deletion or amendment of passages in his manuscriptand to sign an undertaking on assuming office binding himself inadvance to do so.14. The three members of the Committee who oppose a bindingundertaking believe that in practice former Ministers will accept thegreat majority of the proposals put to them and will not wishdeliberately to prejudice the security of the country, the conduct of
its international relations or the basis of Cabinet government. Butin so far as these and particularly the third are matters not of factbut of judgment or of taste, the majority of the Committee think thatthe author should have the right, having discussed the matter fully with the Secretary of the Cabinet, in the exceptional case in whichhe considered the Secretary&apos;s requests oppressive, to accept the riskof prosecution and to publish. There should be no ultimatecensorship except the law of the land. They consider it important that the possibility of publishing dissenting opinions should not be excluded. Furthermore, they regard it as unreasonable andunrealistic to expect a Minister on leaving office to bind himself toaccept a form of censorship at an unknown future date and inunknown circumstances when the character of the Government andthe relationship of the Secretary of the Cabinet to it may be whollyother than they are to-day.15. The two members who believe that a Minister should beasked to undertake to amend his manuscripts in accordance withthe proposals of the Secretary of the Cabinet, consider that as thefact of having been a Minister confers a peculiar interest and valueon his autobiographical work so also it imposes a peculiar obligation.The law itself requires him to obtain authority for the publicationof information which he acquired in his official capacity as a Minister.He could be restrained from publishing without authority by an injunction issued by a judge: this he would presumably accept. Butin the view of these members the Secretary of the Cabinet is betterplaced to give or withhold authority than a judge; he could discussdisputed points with the author and would insist on a deletion oramendment only if there were real risk to security or to the currentGovernments international relations or to the maintenance of the doctrine of collective responsibility. He would moreover be in aposition to assess, as an individual author would not, the cumulative effect of disclosures which though not seriously harmful individuallymight over a series of publications weaken the basis of cabinet government, and public confidence in it. Moreover, an author whoconsidered the requests for amendment oppressive could lay his case before the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. the minority therefore consider that the judgment of the Secretary ofthe Cabinet should be accepted; and that since there can be no whollyeffective legal sanction Ministers should place themselves under the moral sanction of a prior undertaking to accept it.16. The two members draw attention to the fact that, while wehave been considering the questions we have been asked to consider,the serialisation of extracts from Mr. Nutting&apos;s book were published and that it contains much information obtained by him and entrusted to him in confidence as a Minister and which he was not authorisedto publish. They feel that this information is used as evidence tosupport his case that the Suez episode was one of the most disgracefulincidents of British history arranging for Israel to attack Egypt sothat we could then seize the Suez Canal under guise of an interventionto stop a war which we had ourselves helped to arrange, and that the
publication makes it clear to the world, including the Arab world,what the British did 11 years ago. Now, with our oil supplies in danger, the much fuller description has been published in the bookcontaining many passages in full which Mr. Nutting had been asked by the Secretary of the Cabinet not to publish. The publication bothof the extracts and of the book contravenes the provisions of theOfficial Secrets Acts, and though in the circnmstances of the particular case the Attorney-General decided that it would not be in the publicinterest to institute criminal proceedings, it might well be that in a future case of an unauthorised publication by a Minister or an ex-Minister prosecution would be justified and indeed necessary inorder to protect the public interest. The two members feel that thisexample illustrates the danger of saying in Annex B: &quot; You should pay attention to what the Secretary of the Cabinet says but of courseyou are not even under a moral obligation to accept what he says.&quot;Writings other than memoirs17. We have considered whether whatever arrangement applies to autobiography as such should apply also to works for which the author has drawn on knowledge gained by reason of having servedas a Minister. The line here is difficult to draw. In a sense the wholeof an author&apos;s knowledge and experience forms a basis for hissubsequent writing, but it is possible to distinguish cases whereknowledge acquired as a Minister forms a background from those where it supplies the substance of the book. The publication ofstudies, for example, of the structure and day-to-day working of thecentral machinery of government or comparing the Cabinet andPresidential systems, would be the more valuable for being writtenout of the first hand experience of former Ministers; but they could also be an occasion for the sort of discussion which,,,as we have indicated in Section I and paragraph 9 of this report could beharmful to our political life. This type of disclosure ought to be avoided no less in works on Government or political theory than inautobiography. Clearly Ministers cannot be asked to submit all their subsequent writings to the Secretary of the Cabinet and wethink that reliance must be placed on their own judgment to decide which of them raise considerations similar to those raised by memoirsand to regard them as being covered by the undertaking referred toin paragraph 12. In some instances it may be impracticable tosubmit manuscripts in advance, for example, where newspaperarticles, lectures or broadcasts are commissioned at short notice; butin writing these former Ministers should bear in mind the obligations of reticence which rest upon them as such.Custody of official papers18. Since 1934 it has been the rule that Ministers on leavingoffice should return to the Cabinet Office all Cabinet documentsexcept, where there has been no change in the political party formingthe Government, those required for current administration. InOctober 1964 outgoing Ministers were asked in addition to leavebehind them any other official documents including copies. Wethink that Cabinet documents should be returned to the cabinet office and that other official papers, which we define in the termsCONFIDENTIAL8233 b
of the Public Records Act 1958 as &quot; administrative and departmentalrecords belonging to Her Majesty &quot; should be left behind to form part of the departmental archives which will eventually be depositedin the Public Record Office. A Minister should be free to removehis purely private correspondence, notwithstanding that some of this may refer to official business; and we think that the existing rule should be modified to the extent of permitting a Minister to take with him a copy of any departmental document (other than oneclassified &quot; TOP SECRET &quot;) with which he has had a particularlyclose personal association, either because he drafted it himself or because it was drafted on his instructions in such a way as to reflecthis personal views. A Minister^ private papers will eventually forma useful source of material for historians and we think that theywould be impoverished if they did not contain some reflection ofhis immediate personal contribution to the formation of policy. we recognise that the class of papers we have in mind is difficult to define and we therefore consider that a Minister should take withhim copies of departmental papers only with the agreement of theSecretary of the Cabinet who would naturally consult the permanenthead of the Department in question. This would ensure someuniformity of practice and would afford an opportunity for theSecretary of the Cabinet to advise the Minister on the safe custody of these papers which, in so far as they contain copies of official documents, should not be made available to the public until thecorresponding official records are also opened for public inspection.Diaries19. We do not think that Ministers -could or should beforbidden to keep diaries; and we cannot in practice distinguish between a diary kept in manuscript and one recorded on tape, butwe think that Ministers who keep diaries, or collect diary-life material,as a basis for subsequent authorship should bear certainconsiderations in mind. Ministers traditionally refrain from takingnotes of Cabinet meetings but it would be possible for a minister with a retentive memory to record subsequently an almost verbatimaccount of the discussion on a particular topic. The knowledge thatone or more Cabinet colleagues may be recording either in a diaryor on tape, a full account of confidential discussions in Cabinet and elsewhere is likely to inhibit the spontaneity and frankness ofdiscussion which we consider important to the conduct of cabinet government. There is, moreover, one difference between diary andtape recordings namely that the latter have to be typed, and thisconstitutes a potential risk both to security in the narrow sense andto the confidentiality of Government business, Private transcriptionof tape recordings is not necessarily subject to the precautions that can be taken to preserve the secrecy of official material and control the number of copies made. We recommend that the risks inherent in keeping diaries or diary-material should be drawn to the attentionof Ministers; that they should make the typist who transcribes this material aware of the provisions of the Official Secrets Acts; and thatdiaries and diary-like material whether in manuscript or on tape andtranscription from tape should be kept under secure lock and key.
Contracts20. The existing conventions are silent about the propriety of entering into contracts with publishers while holding office. It is,however, a principle of public life that Ministers must so order their affairs that no conflict arises, or appears to arise, between theirprivate interests and their public duties. It is also a well-establishedrule that Ministers should not accept gifts or services which would place them under an obligation to a commercial undertaking. Partof the difficulty of the whole problem of Ministerial publication lies in the fact that the publication of memoirs can be extremelyprofitable both for the publisher and for the author; and wherepublication follows shortly after the author has held office it may also be true that the extent of the profit is directly related to thefrankness of his disclosures, not necessarily of State secrets in the strict sense but of confidential gossip and personalities. ministers should avoid putting themselves in a position where it may bethought, whether justifiably or not, that they are preparing, while in office, to make money out of the positions which they have held and the confidential information which they have acquired.21. We recommend that Ministers should not, while in office,enter into a contract with a publisher for any work based directly on ministerial experience. This limitation would apply from the presenttime; we do not think that Ministers who have already entered into such a contract need be required to seek to have it cancelled ormodified.22. Our terms of reference do not require us to consider therules applying to the memoirs of military commanders; but since wehave been informed (in the statement in Annex A) of the reasons whygreater latitude was allowed in the use of official information inmemoirs dealing with the two world wars of this century we wish toplace on record that we do not consider that any greater latitudeshould be given to military commanders writing about their conductof operations in war than is allowed to Ministers defending their conduct of affairs in time of peace.IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS23. We are agreed that Ministers are not given sufficientguidance at present on the considerations they should bear in mindin collecting material for, and publishing, work which depends onknowledge acquired in their official capacity. We have thereforemade a number of recommendations for providing such additionalguidance as seems to us necessary. We recognise that formerMinisters in publishing autobiographical material must have regardto considerations of national security. Apart from this, the problemseems to us to be one of maintaining a reasonable balance betweenon the one hand the need in our system of government to maintainmutual confidence among Ministerial colleagues and on the other the value of the contribution which political memoirs can make to8233
an effective and informed parliamentary democracy (paragraphs 3-6).This is not an easy balance to strike, since the relative weight whichshould be given to these considerations is largely a matter of personal and political judgment and will depend in varying degrees on theamount of time that has elapsed since the events in question. Wehave concluded therefore that guidance should be. given in twoforms: in the form of a written statement which Ministers will seewhile in office and in the form of advice on manuscripts before they are submitted to the publishers. We are agreed that theappropriate person to advise on the manuscript (as well as to giveauthority for publication for the purposes of the Official secrets acts) is the Secretary of the Cabinet. We did not find it possibleto agree, however, on whether or not Ministers should be requiredto give an undertaking to accept any suggestions the Secretary ofthe Cabinet may make for deletion or amendment. (the considerations on either side are set out in paragraphs 14-16.)Notwithstanding a difference of view on this point we believe thatif our recommendations are accepted, useful guidance will be givento future Ministers. They will find conveniently in one place astatement of the law and conventions that govern publication ofmaterial acquired in their official capacity and the collection andcustody of autobiographical material, and on the procedure to befollowed before publication.24.   We recommend that:(1) On taking office, Ministers should be given a statementsetting out the considerations, legal and otherwise,governing the collection and publication of materialbased on knowledge acquired in their official capacity.This statement should be embodied in the memorandum&quot;Questions of Procedure for Ministers&quot; (paragraph 11and Annex B).(2) Before publication, manuscripts of memoirs should be sentto the Secretary of the Cabinet, so that authority can begiven for publication of material which might otherwise be covered by the Official Secrets Acts and the author&apos;attention can be drawn to passages which appear to be in breach of the conventions (paragraph 12). Otherpublications, which seem to former Ministers to raisesimilar issues, should be treated in the same way, unlessconsiderations of time render this impracticable(paragraphs 12 and 16).(3) On taking office, Ministers should be required to sign a document:(i) acknowledging that the Official Secrets Acts applyto them;(ii) undertaking that they v/ill not carry away official documents when they leave office except, with the
permission of the Secretary of the Cabinet, copiesof papers (other than those classified &quot; TOPSECRET&quot;) with which they have had a particularly close personal association; and(iii) undertaking to submit manuscripts to the Secretaryof the Cabinet as in (2) (paragraph 12).(4) On leaving office, Ministers should be shown the documentin (3) and asked to sign a statement that they haveobserved undertaking (3) (ii) above (paragraph 12).(5) The security risks inherent in keeping diaries ordiary-material should be drawn to the attention ofMinisters, who should ensure that any typisttranscribing the material is aware of the provisions of theOfficial Secrets Acts and that any such material is keptsecurely (paragraph 19).(6) Ministers should have regard to the advice of the Secretaryof the Cabinet on the custody of any copies of official documents which they have been permitted to take awayon leaving office (paragraph 18).(7) While in office, Ministers should not enter into a contract with a publisher for any work based directly on ministerial experience; this limitation should applyfrom the present time (paragraph 21).ANNEX a present CONVENTIONS ON PUBLICATIONS, clearance of MANUSCRIPTS AND CUSTODY OF DOCUMENTS(see paragraph 10)Publication of memoirs and biography1. It has long been recognised that an individual who hascarried personal responsibility for the management of public affairs is entitled after he has left office to defend his record and hisreputation, whether directly in memoirs or an autobiography or indirectly by an &quot; official&quot; biography undertaken by his son or bya historian commissioned by his family. Hence:(a) it is generally accepted that Ministers need not refrain fromkeeping a private diary;(b) a  former   Minister  may  &quot; refresh  his   memory&quot;   byconsulting:(i) departmental papers dating from the period when hewas in charge of the Department, and(ii) Cabinet   (including   Cabinet   Committee)   paperscirculated to him while in office (in the case of
an official biographer, such papers as his subjectorginated); and(c) as a corollary of (b) a research worker assisting a formerPrime Minister who is in poor health has occasionallybeen given access to papers other than those ofparticular secrecy, subject to an undertaking that officialmaterial will be used only for the purpose of theautobiography and an acknowledgement that the official secrets Acts apply.2. If a former Minister (or his official biographer) takesadvantage of the opportunity to consult Cabinet papers or his intention otherwise becomes known, he is asked to submit hismanuscript to the Secretary of the Cabinet for clearance beforesending it to the publisher or signing a contract for publication andto accept such suggestions for amendment or deletion as may bemade. If necessary the Secretary of the Cabinet consults the PrimeMinister of the day and the Prime Minister of the Administrationsin which the former Minister served or the current Leader of his party.  In considering manuscripts, regard is normally had to:(i) considerations of national security;(ii) any risk that disclosure would embarrass the Governmentin office in their current relations with foreign Powers;(iii) the maintenance of confidential relationships by avoidingin particular (a) the disclosure of differences of view between Ministers, or between Ministers and their namedadvisers, and (b) the use of direct quotation or closeparaphrase from official, and particularly Cabinet,documents within the closed period (which would be liable to provoke a demand for publication of all the relevant papers).Authors are asked to delete material which is objectionable under any of these heads (bearing in mind in relation to (iii) thatdisclosures of differences become less objectionable with the passageof time). In the absence of an effective sanction, reliance is placedon persuasion and the good sense of the author who will oftendiscuss the manuscript with the Secretary of the Cabinet with aview to reaching agreement.3. Greater latitude was allowed in the use of official informationderiving from the periods of the two Great Wars of the presentcentury, for various reasons:(a) Military commanders are open to public criticism for their conduct of operations and can reasonably claim a right of reply. It has seemed unreasonable to deny the samefacility to their political superiors.
(b) Wartime administration raises problems which are of specialpublic interest and analysis of them may point valuablelessons for the future.(c) In both wars there have been coalition Governments and less reason therefore to fear that disclosure of Ministerialdiscussion will lead to political embarrassment.id) Disclosures relating to war periods, when the world is divided between allies and enemies, involve less risk of embarrassment in relation to foreign Powers.ie) Official war histories are published well in advance of the50-year period.Publications other than memoirs and autobiographies4. A Minister is precluded while holding office from thepractice of journalism, though not from contributing an occasionalarticle to a newspaper for the purpose of supplementing other meansof informing the public about the work of his Department. He isnot precluded from publishing writing of a literary, historical,scientific, philosophical or romantic character. In so far as he wished, for the purpose of writings of a non-biographical kind, todraw on knowledge and experience acquired as a Minister, forexample in an academic treatise on Government, he would not beentitled to any special access to papers; but the considerations oflaw and principle relevant to autobiography would apply to him.He would be expected not to disclose official information or theprivate discussions of Ministers with one another or with namedadvisers. But there is no general requirement or even understandingthat he should submit his manuscript for clearance (although a minister has on occasion been asked to do so).Custody of official documents5. Government documents are the property of the Crown.Since 1934 it has been the rule, promulgated by successive PrimeMinisters, that Ministers on relinquishing office should return to theCabinet Office all Cabinet documents except for those required for current administration, which should be handed to their successors(assuming no change in the political Party in office). A specialexception was made to this rule in 1945 in the circumstances of thewar-time Coalition Government, when Ministers were permitted toretain War Cabinet memoranda and other documents of State whichthey wrote themselves. After the election of October 1964 outgoingMinisters were asked not only to return all Cabinet and CabinetCommittee documents but also to leave behind them any other official documents, including copies.6. Ministers have in the past made collections of papers, which included originals or copies of official documents such as minutespassing between themselves and senior officials, correspondence withcolleagues about proposals under consideration between them, drafts of Cabinet memoranda, telegrams, notes on departmental meetings
and so on. The Law Officers advised in 1934 that &quot; once any document is initialled for any official purpose it becomes an officialdocument and the property of His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;. Manyof the documents in collections of this kind are therefore Crownproperty. They may also be public records, subject to the PublicRecords Act and therefore required, if not destroyed, to be lodgedin the Public Records Office. Some of them may raise questions of security.7. In relation to collections already in being there has beena natural reluctance to insist on the extraction and return of officialmaterial, including Cabinet papers. It has therefore been the practice to permit official documents to remain in the collection provided thatthe holder enters into suitable arrangements for the continued safecustody of the documents on the following general principles:(a) Where an institution, such as a University or College libraryis asked to accept responsibility for a collection which includes documents to which the 50-year rule applies,it should accept them only on the understanding that itis given discretion by the donor to withhold from public inspection such parts of the collection as it would be contrary to the public interest to disclose.(b) In exercising this discretion the Institution should be guided by the Cabinet Office or the relevant GovernmentDepartment.(c) Cabinet papers should be segregated and no access permittedwithout prior consultation with the Cabinet Office.(d) Access to any official documents should be conditional on theperson concerned giving a written undertaking that, if he wishes to publish anything based on such material, he will submit his manuscript in draft, before submitting it toa publisher, for official scrutiny and will accept any amendments or omissions that may be required in thepublic interest.If a collection is in the hands of Trustees, the Trustees are askedto observe similar safeguards and to ensure that any official documentsare not disposed of without the consent of the Prime Minister ofthe day. Consideration is currently being given to the use of theLord Chancellor^ power under section 4(1) of the Public RecordsAct to designate places in which substantial private collections of official and semi-official papers are kept as &quot;places of deposit&quot; forthe purposes of the Act. Conditions can be attached to thisdesignation to ensure that any Government documents in thecollection are kept in proper custody, are not made available to public inspection until the end of the appropriate closed period, andconversely that the public are given access to papers which wouldbe open to inspection were they in the Public Records Office.
ANNEX draft PASSAGE FOR INCLUSION IN A MEMORANDUM&quot; QUESTIONS OF PROCEDURE FOR MINISTERS&quot;FOR INSERTION AFTER SECTION XVIII OF the document ANNEXED TO C (P) (66) 5 (see paragraphs11 and 24)XVIII.   PUBLICATION AFTER LEAVING OFFICE OFMEMOIRS OR OTHER WORK BASED ON MINISTERIALEXPERIENCEGeneral considerations86. A Minister by accepting office also accepts certain obligations, both legal and moral, which remain with him after hehas ceased to be a Minister. These include the obligation of reticenceabout matters which he has learned or observed in his official capacity.A Minister who after leaving office wishes to publish work, whetherautobiographical or not, which draws on knowledge acquired in his official capacity should bear in mind the following:(a) Disclosure without authority of information which heobtained by virtue of his office may involve a breach of the Official Secrets Acts and of the fiduciary relationshipin which Ministers stand to the Crown.(b) Disclosure of official information may also embarrass theGovernment of the day in their relations with foreign powers and possibly endanger national security,(c) Apart from legal considerations, the maintenance of theCabinet system of government depends on frankness and mutual trust among colleagues in the Government. &quot; in cabinet differences of view can be stated and if need be argued and then advisedly surrendered with the viewto a common conclusion &quot; (Gladstone). Ministers may feel less free to participate in this process of reaching acommon mind if the stand they have taken and anysurrenders made are likely thereafter to become public knowledge. Consequently disclosure of discussions in cabinet and of private consultations among Ministers can do grave harm to the foundation on which the system rests.It is accordingly incumbent on former Ministers to observe a proper reticence in writing of their experiencesin office.(d) By convention Ministers do not publicly disclose the advicethey have received from officials or the views of individualofficials since to do so might undermine confidence inthe impartiality of the Civil Service or compromise the usefulness of an officer liable to service abroad for employment in particular posts.8233c
(e) The need for reticence decreases with the passage of time.Former Ministers should be more reticent the nearer theyare to the events described; and they should have regardto whether former colleagues to whom they are referringare still active in public life.87. Authority for the publication of material which might otherwise be regarded as covered by the Official Secrets Acts can beobtained by submitting manuscripts to the Secretary of the cabinet who is responsible for giving formal authority for the purpose of theActs and has a duty to warn the author if what he proposes to publishwould endanger national security or seriously embarrass theGovernment of the day in their relations with foreign Powers. Hemay also take the opportunity of drawing the author&apos;s attention topassages which appear to be in breach of the conventions governing the confidential relations between Ministers, their colleagues andtheir official advisers. If necessary the Secretary of the Cabinetconsults the Prime Minister of the day and, where appropriate, thePrime Minister of the Administrations in which the author served.88. Ministers are asked on taking office to give an undertaking to submit manuscripts of relevant work which, after leaving office,they propose to publish to the Secretary of the Cabinet before it isset up in print. They should allow adequate time for theconsideration and, if necessary, amendment of the manuscript. Theywill be able, if they wish, to discuss the Secretary&apos;s comments withhim and they should in general (pay^Tattention to) his suSSestionsfor the deletion or amendment of material.89. The considerations which apply to autobiographical workapply also to work which draws similarly on knowledge gained byreason of service as a Minister, such, for example, as academic workson aspects of government. If a Minister is in any doubt as to whether his undertaking covers a particular project he should seek the advice of the Secretary of the Cabinet. The obligations of reticence applyalso to articles, lectures and broadcasts and, while the priorsubmission of texts of this character to the Secretary of the Cabinetmay be rendered impracticable by considerations of time, formerMinisters should consult him if they are in any doubt about the propriety of using material derived from their Ministerial experience.Collection of autobiographical material90. On leaving office Ministers should surrender all cabinet and Cabinet Committee papers including copies. They should not take away original departmental papers. These fall within the definition in the Public Records Act 1958 of administrative and departmental records belonging to Her Majesty and will in due course be deposited in the Public Record Office. They may keep purelypersonal correspondence and, subject to obtaining the permission ofthe Secretary of the Cabinet, who will consult the permanent headof their Department, they may if they wish take copies of
departmental documents (other than those classified &quot;TOPSECRET &quot;) with which they have had a particularly close personalassociation, either because they drafted them themselves or becausethe documents explicitly reflect their personal views on policy. a minister who takes copies of official documents is personallyresponsible for seeing that such copies are kept in secure custody,are not disclosed to persons who would not be entitled to access tothe corresponding official papers and are not disposed of withoutappropriate safeguards while the corresponding official documentsare closed to public inspection. The Cabinet Office will be glad toadvise on custody and on arrangements which have been made forthe preservation of existing collections of former Ministers inUniversities and other institutions.Diaries91. Ministers are not precluded from keeping diaries, though they should not make and take away notes of Cabinet meetings. Ifthey do keep a diary, either in manuscript or on tape, they shouldremember that the knowledge that Cabinet colleagues may be makinga full record of confidential discussions among Ministers in cabinet and elsewhere is likely to inhibit the spontaneity and frankness whichis important to the conduct of Cabinet government and that the mereexistence of such records, particularly if kept on tape, constitutes a potential risk both to the security in the narrow sense and to theconfidentiality of Government business. If a Minister employs atypist to transcribe either manuscript or tape he should make heraware of the provisions of the Official Secrets Acts which will applyto her and should see that both the original and the transcription arekept under secure lock and key.Contracts92. In accordance with the principle that Ministers should soorder their affairs that no conflict appears to arise between theirprivate interests and their public duties and that they should not placethemselves under an obligation to any commercial undertaking,Ministers should refrain while in office from entering into a contract with a publisher for any work based directly on Ministerialexperience.
