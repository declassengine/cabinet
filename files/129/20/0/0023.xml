Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) BillIn accordance with the decision of the Cabinet at their meeting on 1st August (C.M. (i+7) 68th Conclusions),^! circulate herewith a draft Bill (Annex i),2,     The powers taken by the Bill are not to make new regulations, but to use for new -purposes the powers conferred by regulations continued in force under the Act of 19k5*It is, of course, always possible that it may at some stage be necessary to obtain new powers not covered by existingauthority.     But as at present advised it would seem that existing powers cover everything contemplated by theGovernment&apos;s present proposals.     It therefore seems best toproceed with a Bill in the form drafted, which is likely to prove relatively uncontroversial, rather than to include a clause giving power to make new regulations.3*     Other outstanding points at their meetings on the 1st August (CM. (^7) 67th and68th Conclusions) the Cabinet agreed that a number of proposals in my memorandum (C.P. (1;7) 221) required further examination.Annex II shows what is proposed as regards;-  .(1) Food production(2) Petrol(3) Foreign travel.-I understand that the President of the Board of Trade will beready to make an oral statement on film remittances.H.D.Treasury Chambers, S.W,1.i+TH AUGUST, 19itf.

This Act may be cited as the Supplies and services (Transitional Powers) Act* 1947.
ANNEX III , -   FOOD production.     An expansion of  100 millions by 1951/2 in the netagricultural output over the 192+6/7 level is technicallypossible, but only if all the necessary resources, incentivesand stimuli are made available and applied.      It must also beassumed that weather conditions, disease and other naturallimitations are not unfavourable.2.      Exceptional and dramatic action will have to be taken bythe Government to provide additional labour, houses, hostels,machinery, feedingstuffs and other requsities (e.g, rawmaterials), together with substantial financial aid andstimulus.3.     For example, between now and 1951. 12+0,000 workers,preferably British, will have to be recruited for work on theland, of whom 60,000 will be required by mid-192+8.     30,000foreigners will be needed in addition, or more if the requirednumber of British recruits cannot be obtained.km     Again, an additional 35*000 bouses specifically for occupation by agricultural workers will be required by July,192+8 over and above the 35,000 already programmed for this date.     More camps and hostels will also be required.5.     Farmers will have to invest over the next four years some 200 millions for additional machinery, livestock, etc. andthere will be other capital needs amounting to a further 50 millions as well, ,   To enable them to do this and to coverincreases in wages and other costs already incurred sinceprices were last fixedj or imminent, some  70 millions shouldbe injected forthwith into the annual farm income, in part byad hoc subsidies, but mainly by increased prices (includingacreage payments).6.     It will not be possible to achieve an expansion of 100 million in the net agricultural production before 1951&quot;because, the expansion of livestock population necessarilytakes time.      ( 100 million increase in net production means 138 million increase in gross production and of this no less than  127ir million is attributed to livestock).   Moreover,the labour force can be increased only as new building iscarried out; and farmers cannot be expected to incur theadditional capital outlay of  250 millions required for theexpansion of production, nor could they obtain the necessarymaterials for the necessary programme of re-equipment of farms in less than four years.7*     According to the best estimates that can be made, no increase in the net agricultural output can be expected by theend of 1948.     The main reason for this is that there is stilla downward trend in livestock production in consequence of severe cuts in feedingstuffs during 192+6 and the first halfof 192+7 and the losses due to the severe winter.-8.      The transition which is taking place, however, from non-dollar-saving products (e,g, potatoes) to dollar-saving products(e.g. meat, eggs and milk products) may be expected to savesome  10 millions in dollars by the end of 192+8 if full advantage is taken of this in the import programme.-h-
II    -   PETROL9.     The Cabinet agreed on 24th July (CM. (47) 64th Conclusions,Minute 3) that a saving of 500,000 tons of petrol should heachieved by cuts in the basic ration and in the amount of petrol consumed by commercial vehicles and the Services.10.    To achieve the saving of 500,000 tons it is proposedthat issues&apos;of petrol to commercial vehicles and supplementary .allowances for private cars and motor cycles should be cut by 10%, and the basic ration for private cars and motorcycles &quot;by 33^-/-*%, and. that all practicable economies must bemade in the allocation of petrol to the Services,      Thisproposal should ensure a saving of 500,000 tons if the schemeis administered tightly.      But in some cases the cut of 10$.insupplementary allowances to private, cars used for essentialpurposes and in issues to commercial vehicles will have to be modified on apjoealsj and in the case of commercial vehiclesit is belived&apos; that the net saving on a 10% cut, after allowing for appeals, should be 3%,      It should, however, be possibleto achieve a saving of 500,000 tons by the measures proposed.11.   At their meeting on 1st August (CM. (47) 67th Conclusions,Minute 2) the Cabinet suggested that the possibility of makinga greater saving than 500,000 tons should be considered.     Thishas been done, but it is clear that a greater saving could notbe secured except hy:-(i) a further cut Ifl the basic ration;(ii) a further reduction in supplementary allowancesj(iii) a cut In the issues of petrol to charabancs.Ill    -   FOREIGN TRAVEL12, With the foreign travel allowance for an adult at  75 fortwelve months the allowance for a child has been  40, On thebasis of an allowance for an adult of  35 for fourteen months,as now proposed, the proportionate allowance for a child wouldbe  20.
