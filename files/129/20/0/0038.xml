Chancellor- of the exchequer on the 5th August the Cabinet agreed (C.M..(h7) 69th.Conclusions, Minute 2 (5)) that foreign travel allowances should be reduced from  75 for twelve months to  35 forfourteen months, and that the proportionate allowance for a child should be  20.I am sure that these reductions must now beincreased and accelerated.     I propose that -(r.)    Pleasure Travel.(i) The reduction from  75 to  35, which was due to come into force on the 1st October next,should take effect at once, as regards all future applications for exchange for this purpose;(ii) From the 1st October next, no exchange at all should be permitted for pleasure travel abroad;(iii) Until the 1st October, fares involvingforeign exchange payments should be allowed tocontinue, but from that date exchange should notbe provided for pleasure travel by foreign ships,or aircraft from this country.These proposals should result in a saving of about 30 millions a year   in our present rate of expenditure.They will seriously affect the travel agencies,     i suggest, therefore, that the agencies should be seen when theannouncement is made, so that-any minor administrative arrangements to lessen the blow can be put in hand.(b)    Business Travel   .The authority of. the commercial banks to approveexchange applications on behalf of business men should be
drastically limited at once.    . In future, the Bank ofEngland will: scrutinise applications for more than seven days-&apos; travel in Europe and the Mediterranean area, andfor more than fifteen days to other destinations.&apos;    Ipropose that vthe rate per day should remain at  10 for the americas but be reduced to  8 for.Europe and the Mediterraneanare a.     The saving   under this head   is difficult to estimate,but the gross cost for the last  twelve months has beenapproximately  12 millions, and I hope that at least one-quarter of this can be eliminated.H.D.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1.,25th August, 1947.
