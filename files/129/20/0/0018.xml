Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1947SECRET .    Copy No,CP. (47) 218     -28th July, 1947CABINETAIR TRANSPORT FOR VXPs.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister ,of CivilAviation %IN CP. (46) 195 our predecessors set out for the information of our col-leagues particulars of the resources available at that time (May 1946) for long-range air transport of Cabinet Ministers and other front rank VJ.P.&apos;s. In thisMemorandum the position relating to both long- and medium-range transport is reviewed and the resources available are restated.2. Under the arrangements contemplated in CP. (46) 195 and subsequentinter-departmental discussion, the responsibility to provide air transport for cabinet Ministers, civil V.I.P.&apos;s and senior officials of Government departments in general rests primarily with the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Until such time as Civil Aviation are equal to the acceptance of their commitments in full, how-ever, they may, as necessary, seek the assistance of the Royal Air Force. TheR.A.F. is in any event responsible for the conveyance of military V.I.P.&apos;s andof civil V.I.P.&apos;s to military formations, or to areas where the employment of a civil aircraft would be unsuitable.3. There has been a marked increase in the commitments which tne Ministryof Civil Aviation have been able to assume, but this has been achieved largely bythe employment of charter aircraft. Of the 47 V.I.P. flights undertaken by civil Aviation/between 1st September, 1946, and the end of May 1947, 36 were-made by charter aircraft, and the remaining 11 by the Corporations. Duringthe same period, 19 V.I.P. flights were undertaken by the Royal Air Force,mainly of a long range character.4, The facilities which are available to the Royal Air Force and CivilAviation are set out below.5. The only squadron capable of undertaking commitments of this kind isNo. 24 (Commonwealth) squadron which is established to meet the requirementsof all the three Services in the United Kingdom for special flights of a military character,, and to maintain a military air link between United Kingdom and commonwealth countries.. The Dominions contribute a proportion of the air-crews to this squadron. &apos;No, 24 squadron has a total of sixteen long- and medium-range aircraft; tenof these are equipped to ordinary passenger standards, while two Yorks and fourDakotas have been fitted to a higher degree of comfort than the normal R.A.F.standard. The first call upon the use, of one York has been reserved, for thePrime Minister, and one Dakota is normally reserved in the same way for cabinet ministers. - At present, this Dakota is allocated to Lord Pafcenham.  Neither of33992
these-reservations is exclusive, and flights may be undertaken by these two air-cr&quot;aft for other V.I.Ps., after confirmation that they are not required by thosewho have first call upon them. &apos;6. The over-all capacity of No. 24 Squadron is at present seriously reducedby the acute shortage of aircrews trained to the necessary standards for V.I.P.work, and also by the general shortage throughout the R.A.F. of the technicalman-power required for maintaining aircraft serviceability. Therefore, theRAF. resources which can, from time to time, be made available for civil V.I.P.flights are extremely limited. Even a small diversion to special civil tasks is liable to reduce the aircraft available for meeting the primary Service obligation.7. It will be seen that it has not yet been possible to establish the arrange-ments contemplated in CP. (46) 195, and until it becomes possible to do so thesituation is bound to remain unsatisfactory.   The Ministry of Civil Aviation&apos; has formulated plans, subject to Treasury approval, for the maintenance and operation by the appropriate Corporations, of special V.I.P. aircraft. It wouldbe uneconomic to provide sufficient of these aircraft to make sure that every V.I.P.was conveyed by them. Plans so far formulated assume therefore that use canbe made of the Corporations&apos; scheduled services which may be expected to expand,(    and that recourse may be had, in order to meet exceptional sudden demands, to(hmiOJiLfcthree civil charter firms approved for the purpose&quot; by the Ministry of CivilAviation. A study of ^experience over the past twelve months indicates, however,that the maintenance of a number of special V.I.P. aircraft would be likely tobe an economic means of providing for most of the V.I.P. flights. On long-rangeflights, roughly speaking those going beyond Europe, the Ministry of CivilAviation proposes that the B.O.A.C should be its agent for the maintenance and operation of sufficient aircraft to make sure that two V.I.P. flights could beundertaken at any time. Present indications are that this arrangement would belikely to provide for practically all the probable demands at no greater expensethan the employment of charter firms. Similarly B.E.A.C. will be asked tomaintain two aircraft for medium-range flights, roughly speaking anywhere inthe continent of Europe, and two aircraft for short-range flights, within thiscountry and to neighbouring European countries.8.   As regards types of aircraft, for the civil arrangements the obviouschoice for the medium-range flights is the Viking IB which is the type theB.E.A.C. is progressively introducing this year on its continental routes.   Forthe short-range flights the obvious choice would be the Dove of the type whichthe B.E.A.C. propose to include in their fleet when they are available.  The Doves,however, are not likely to be available until the middle of 1948 at the earliest,i For the long-range flights the plan has proceeded on the assumption thatj the aircraft would be the Tudor III (the Tudor I with revised internalI arrangements).     Pending satisfactory conclusion of the modificationI programme now being carried out on the Tudor I, it is not possible, however; &quot;to assess its operational uses on the North Atlantic routes.9. It will be seen that it is not possible to bring the full Ministry of CivilAviation plan into operation for some little time to come. Until then, we proposethat demands for V.I.P. flights should be met in accordance with the following procedure. The Department requiring a special flight for a V.I.P. would beexpected, in the first instance, to make certain through the London Air TransportPriority Board that the existing scheduled services cannot meet the requirement.When this is assured the Department concerned then applies to the Ministry ofCivil Aviation giving the necessary assurances, and, in addition, details of therequirements. The Ministry of Civil Aviation then obtains the offer of an aircraft from the appropriate Corporation together with an estimate of costs. If an offeris not forthcoming, the Ministry of Civil Aviation will request the Corporationconcerned to offer the task to an approved charter company. In all cases the flight is arranged only when the sponsoring Department has signified that theestimated cost is justified.10. If the commitment cannot be met from the resources of Civil Aviation,the Ministry of Civil Aviation will then apply to the Air Ministry and the RoyalAir Force will afford all possible assistance. In the light, of the experience quoted in paragraph 3 it may be expected that Civil Aviation resources will be able,in the interim period, to meet most of the demands of air transport of civilian
VXPs. The Royal Air Force will, however, continue to be responsible fbr&apos;the conveyance of military VXPs..and of civilian VXPs. to military units or&apos; to areas where the employment of a civil aircraft would be unsuitable.li. In conclusion; We seek endorsement of the proposals, subject to agree-ment with the Chancellor, that :t-(a) B.O.A.C. shall be responsible, on behalf of the Ministry of Civil Aviation,for the maintenance and operation of a small unit of long-rangeV.I.P. aircraft; and B.E.A.C. shall assume a corresponding responsi-bility for a small unit of medium, and short, range aircraft for the conveyance of civil VXP&apos;s, except &quot;that(6) The Air Ministry shall continue to be entirely responsible for conveyance of military V.I.P&apos;s and civilian V.I.P&apos;s to military formations orto areas where the employment of civil aircraft would be unsuitable.(c) Until the civil units are in operation, the existing procedure outlined in paragraphs 9 and 10 should continue.P. J. N.-B.v n:       ,&apos; 28th July, 1947. &quot; &apos;       - &apos;
