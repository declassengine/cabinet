[;IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S&apos; GOVERNMENT)-SECRETCP. (47)  2505TH SEPTEMBER,  1947. COpY NO.CABINETTHE EXPORT programme memorandum by the President of the Board of trade.      I have now completed the revision of the export programme which I undertook to submit to the Cabinet (CM. (47)74th Conclusions, Minute 2).The programme has been drawn up after consultation withthe production Departments, but they in turn will wish to engage in further consultation with the industries for whichthey are responsible boforo final acceptance of tho figuresfor the middle and end of 1948.      The sum total of the&quot;individual items in the programme for those dates is slightly in excess of the quantities that would bring exports up to140 per cent, and 160 per cent,  of tho 1938&quot; volume.    But thomargin is no more than adequate to allow for a very moderateerror of optimism in the targets proposed.    Within tho limits of the knowledge and experience of the officials concerned,  theprogramme can be accepted as a practicable task for Britishindustry to perform;   but only on conditions that will involvedrastic limitations in the calls mado upon men and materialseither for the manufacture of goods for tho domestic consumeror for the construction of capital goods of all kinds.    If anyof these conditions - the more important are set out in thefollowing paragraphs - are not fulfilled, an expansion in exportsto 140 per cent,  of the 1938 volume by mid-1948 and to160 por cent, by the end of 1948 will not be capable of achievement.2.      The most important prerequisite of success in our exportdrive is that industrial requirements of fuel and power shouldbo met in full.    This means that over the winter months it willbe necessary for tho Government and the National Coal board to take steps to ensure that industry receives at least 24-1-million tons of coal even if other consumers go short;    and that supplies of coke and coking coal are adequate to-allow the ironand steel industry to maintain output at 14 million ingot tonsin 1948,    If the requirements of industry are not met infull we shall require to discriminate in favour of industries and firms of special importance to the export trade;   but since90 per cent,  of industry&apos;s requirements are absorbed in theiron and steel, engineering, heavy chemical, paper-making,food-processing, textile and building materials industriesalone,  it would be idle to suppose that damage to the export industries could bo avoided.3.      It will also be necessary to improve the distributionof coal stocks between firms boforo the winter,  or we shall find ourselves losing output and exports when total stocks arestill relatively high.    The Minister of Fuel and power has this in hand, but the position is likely to remain critical forsome time,  especially in the West Riding.-1-
4.      I am particularly concerned: that the export programme should not he wrecked by lack of steel.    In terms ofemployment, 60 per cent,  of those who are at work on export orders are in the metal and. engineering industries;,  and. theshortage of steel is, seriously reducing the productivity of thoseworkers by interrupting the flow of materials and components.An increase in the supply of steel to the engineering industries would provide us with additional exports of the most acceptabletype without any increased call on man-power and without.detraction from the .re-equipment of - British industry.    But ifthe steel requirements of those industries cannot he met, eventhe most drastic curtailment in the domestic supply ofmachinery and plant might fail to bring exports to the level which we hope to achieve.    The increase    to be made in exportsof engineering products between the end of 1946 and the end of1948 is approximately 50 per cent,  and of this increase, partshould&apos; result from a diversion from homo to foreign markets.Steel requirements for engineering will expand,  therefore, byrather less than 50 per cent.    This relates only to therequirements sponsored by the Ministry of Supply.    agricultural machinery will also claim additional quantities of steel;and any failure to provide sufficient material will be reflected in a more than proportionate loss of exports unless we are prepared to allow British agriculture to go short.The requirements of the Board of Trado both.for direct exports and for the production of metal goods for export will alsoexpand.5.      For the fulfilment of the export programme,  at least3 million tons of.finished steel per annum will be required,rather more than one quarter of the available supply.    Theallocation that has just been made for the fourth quarterof 1947, however, is not sufficient to provide for these requirements and must therefore be increased forthwith.6.     The most important shortfall is in engineering.    TheMinistry of Supply estimate that in ordor to fulfil their programme they, require 200,000 tons more than they w oreallocated in Periodlll;    they have been allocated anadditional  9,000 tons.    Unless this allocation can be revised,there is no prospect whatever that engineering exports will reach the programme laid down in Appendix A.    A revision in the allocations in favour of other export requirements will also be necessary .    The Board of Trade&apos;s programme for exports of metal goods, for example,  cannot be met,  even with drastic cutsin allocations for home market requirements,  unless the allocationis not less  than it was in Period III.7.     A revision of the allocations will involve us in a reviewof the cost in terms of steel of some of pur &quot;priority&quot; require-rnents,  the allocation suggested for those being nearly700,000 tons per quarter,  or approximately as much as for thewhole of the engineering industries.    These requirements are atmany points in direct competition with valuable exports,including some that may be of special importance in bilateral negotiations.    If we are to defer the re-equipment of our industries in order to release more machinery for export,  weshould also be prepared to consider retrenchment even on whathave previously been priority commitments.    In view of thedifficulties we may meet in importing and distributing oil,I suggest that the oil conversion programmes are especially in need of re-examination.    I also suggest that we&apos; should, considera substantial cut in the programme for power stations in view ofthe large quantities of steel and skilled labour that it isabsorbing.
8.     The need for an immediate increase in the allocation of steel to engineering is the more pressing because thedecisions which we&apos; take now will commit us for many months&apos;to come,    The period that elapses:- between placing orders forstool and delivering finished machines is generally nine months, and often longer.    The steel allocations &quot;that are madenow will react9 therefore, on engineering output at the ondof 1948.     Moreover wo havo no reason to expect that totalsteel supplies will bo any larger in the first quarter of1948 than in the last quarter of 1947;    and the improvementin later quarters will not be a largo one, even on the most favourable showing-.9.     Apart- from the needs of tho engineering industries, weshall also be under pressure in our negotiations with othercountries to supply larger quantities of steel in directexports.    A slightly larger allocation has already been madefor this purpose;    and in the export programme a still,highertotal has been allowed for.    I must warn my colleagues,however,  that even this total is likely to fall short of the concessions that I shall be obliged to make and that,  if we areunable  to obtain additional imports of steel by the end of 1948,the cut in domestic steel consumption may have to bocorrespondingly more severe.10.      It will not bo sufficient to increase steel allocations to meet tho requirements, direct and indirect, of the exporttrade.    It will be necessary also to ensure that deliveries arein lino with allocations.    I am not satisfied that the present scheme is adequate for this purpose and suggest that we should proceed at once to modify it in order to make it a suitableinstrument for the purposes it now has to fulfil, this must include an immediate liquidation of the present inflationof permits to acquire.11.     With regard to man-power, I ask that the Control of engagement Ordor should be so operated as to give the textile industries the maximum opportunity of recruiting additionalworkers.    I havo already asked for up to 120,000 more workers for those industries;, but in the plans for tho division of textile output between home and export markets which I outlinebelow,  I have not been able to count upon the successfultransfer to  the textile industries of so large a number ofworkers within the next 6-9 months,12,      I am assuming that tho labour that is required for theexport programme will be found through a reduction in investment in new capital and in the supply of luxuries and inessentialcommodities to tho home market.    Wo cannot hope to-expand our exports of luxury goods much beyond the present level since we are already facing a buyers&apos; market in those goods.    a curtailment of domestic sales, therefore, can be of advantage to us only if we make arrangements for the re-absorption ofthe labour and materials into other export industries withbetter prospects.    I must point out that this re-deployment oflabour is likely to involve us in increased unemployment - much,but not all of it, tfansitional.13.      It has not been possible to draw up the export programme without making provision for a substantial reduction in civilian consumption in many directions, until such time as an overallproduction can be materially increased.    The largest and mostimportant reduction will be in textiles.    Although the issueof clothing coupons has been successively reduced to a level whichis about 50 per cent,  of pre-war,  it will be necessary,  if weare to take full advantage of our export opportunities and toensure that exports roach the target of 160 per cent,  of 1938,
that even this low rate of issue should he cut still further.At present, supplies reaching.the .home market still reflect the&quot; Increased production planned for the home market last december;    and the level of output is appropriate to an export target of  250 million per annum and an issue of4-44 coupons per month,    The revised export target of  350 million will mean a clothes ration of 3-g- coupons per month providedwe can rely on a 5 per cent,  increase in production.    Thiswould be a lower ration than at any time in the war and ifcontinued over a long,period would be bound to react on incentives to effort - particularly in the textile industries themselves.It would involve a cut of about a quarter in the supply of clothto the consumer and a very drastic curtailment in supplies of household textiles.    I estimate that because of the faminein cloth which will result,  it will also lead to unemploymentof at least 10,000 workers in the clothing trades or the equivalent in short time.    Nevertheless I am prepared to acceptthe increased export target and propose to issue 20 couponson 1st October announcing that,  as far as can be seen,  the ration will fall to 3^- per month on 1st March, 1948 for thefollowing six months.&apos;14.     If we can increase the output of textiles by more than5 per cent,  the need to cut the,, ration will be pro tan todiminished.    One major contribution to an improvement in theoutput of cotton and wool would be the exemption of those industries from the obligation to &quot;stagger&quot; their hours duringthe winter.    The staggering of hours in those industries,which are not large consumers of electricity from the grid,will lead to a considerable loss of production without making any significant contribution to the evening out of peak loads;and. in view of .tho importance of the cotton and wool industries to exports and their special difficulties in recruiting man-power, I suggest that we should agree to exempt them from theobligation to &quot;stagger&quot; working hours.    This exemption would understand be unlikely to imperil the scheme for spreading the electricity load in the regions affected.15.      Of the other cuts in domestic consumption I should like to draw special attention to the following:-(i) , The sales of domestic wireless sets can be cut heavilyfrom the present level of about 150,000 per month.This is fully equal to the level of pre-war years and ismore than we can afford in present circumstances.    TheMinistry    of Supply are proposing to call for the exportof 25 per cent,  of the output of wirelsss sets.    Thiswill probably bring exports to the maximum for whichwe can hope but I propose also to introduce a ceilingon domestic sales of 100,000 a month,(ii)    In a number of items such as lawn mowers, vacuum cleanersrefrigerators, etc. I have assumed that the home market should be assigned, not more than one-third of total output.(iii)    I suggest that we- should increase the proportion ofcommercial vehicles for export to 50 per cent.    I hopethat arrangements can also be made to increase theproportion of buses and railway carriages for export.(iv)    We should either raise the proportion of whisky forexport above 75 per cent,  or increase the allocation of barley to the distillers,(v)    We shall have to cut supplies to the home market of consumer goods which use steely such as cutlery, andthere will be resulting shortages.
16.      The reduction in tho supply of consumer goods  (other thantextiles) will be of less importance to the export drive than the cuts in the investment programme which are now under consider-:ation.    These cuts, upon which we shall shortly have a reportfrom the Investment Programmes Committee, should fall mainly   ,upon projects that make no immediate contribution to industrial efficiency and could be deferred without much dislocation.      Mostof the cut will have to fall outside the field of manufacturing industry, partly because the volume of investment in industrialplant and machinery is a.relatively small proportion of thetotal - about a quarter - and also because we ought not to slow down the re-equipment of British industry to the point atwhich the export industries are seriously inconveniencedeither through difficulty in maintaining their plant or throughinability to take advantage of new types of machinery.    since there are few industries that do not already sell an appreciableproportion of their output in foreign markets,-and since muchof the now capital development that is in progress is designed toprovide additional goods for export or in substitution for imports, we cannot &quot;make any large cut in investment in industrialplant and machinery without injury to our longer-term exportprospects.    The major advantage that wo can hope for as aresult of a cut in investment in other fields is a diversion of steel and components from works of construction at home toengineering &quot;products made for export.    But, as we can gainquicker advantage from a diversion of machinery from industrialre-equipment to export, I havo also made provision for anincrease in the proportions of most types of machinery to be exported.    In particular, I have assumed that the B/minister  of food will require to make slower progress with his clean milkpolicy;      that the supply of machinery for boot and shoemanufacturing will fall below the level recommended in theReport of the Working Party;    and that tho requirements of the. Post Office may have to be cut.17.    - I may also quote tho example.of textile machinery.In pre-war years, and also in recent months, about halfof the output of textile machinery was exported.    Outjjut isnow in course of expansion.      I have assumed that practicallythe whole of the increase in output to be expected&quot;over thenext year will go to the export markets, but that, at the sametime, there will be a policy of selection in the types ofmachinery in which exports are pushed.    This policy would be designed to secure delivery to the British textile industry of its most urgent requirements for specialised items of equipment such as automatic looms, automatic warping andwinding machinery, .card clothing and accessories designed to economise labour.&quot; 18.      Tho export programme will call for an increased consumption of imported raw materials, some of them from hard&apos;currency aroas.      I may quote as examples American-type cotton,hides and carbon black.    I have assumed that tho foreign exchangenecessary for the supply of those raw materials will be forth-coming even If this deprives us of other imports.19.     Certain changes in organisation at tho Regional levelseem to me desirable in order to ensure that the maximumassistance is given to firms engaged or willing to engage inexport.    While nothing should bo done to derogate from the,primary responsibility of each Production Department for its ownexports  (e,g.  whoro definite progressing is needed), I amproposing, as a less extravagant alternative to reinforcingall production Departments by recruitment of specialist officers for each of their industries in each area,   that the Board ofTrade* s existing regional export staff should be strengthened as
necessary and its duties somewhat enlarged.    I should liketo sec in each region a committee of t...e senior officers ofthe Production Departments sitting under the chairmanship of ..the Board of Trade Regional Controller with the ExportOfficers as its executive agents.    It would ho the duty ofthis committee: - * &apos;. -        .(i)    Generally to co-ordinate the efforts of theProduction Departments to achieve the.largest possible increase in exports, and in particular,(ii)    To settle: difficulties arising between firmscompeting for materials, labour and components-for export work, and(iii)    To see that the full backing of the regional organisations  (and if necessary headquarters)of the Production Departments is enlisted insupport of approved cases.Tho work of those committees and the Export Officers wouldalso,  of course,  have to bo extended to cover import-savingmanufactures.    I ask my colleagues&apos; agreement to these changes.20.      We shall require in future to discriminate not only between industries but also between firms, in accordancewith their direct or indirect contribution to exports.      Ido not suggest that it will he necessary or possible to discriminate precisely between all the firms in &quot;an industry,e.g.  in making allocations of raw material --this would be an administrative task far beyond our powers.    Wc must, however,be free to give preferential treatment on occasion to keyfirms engaged on export work.    I am preparing a list of suchfirms for communication to Regional Officers;    and use will bemade by agreement with the Ministry of Fuel and Power of this list at once to ensure that the firms that appear on it havereceived their full summer allocation of coal by the beginningof November.21.      Arrangements will &quot;also have to be made to ensure that departments have the means of enforcing, so far as possible,the export quotas to which they are committed in the export programme.    There are at present a number of items -over which no direct departmental control is exercised and for which,therefore, only a general estimate can be made for inclusion in the export programme.    I am having such cases examined toseo whether attribution to a specific Production department is necessary.      In the meantime I should be glad if departments would confirm that the figures which they have accepted aresomething more than a forecast upon which no control can bebrought to bear,   and indicate whether any special means of strengthening   their hands would be required.22.      An expansion in exports from about 110 per cent,  of1938 to 160 per cent,  must involve&apos;a heavy additional commitment in drums,  containers and pakaging materials of all kinds.Since tho largest part of the increase is in machinery and vehicles,  there will be an especially large demand for timberfor crating.    But steel, paper, sacking, glass bottles and other types of containers and packaging material - many of themalready scarce - will be in increased demand.&apos; - I suggest thatthis problem should be the subject of special investigation by the Materials Committee and that the allocation ofmaterials for the packing of exports should be immediatelyincreased to fit the new export programme.
23.      The figures included in Appendix A will form thesubject of consultation with many individual industries.I should propose to release them&quot; (without the comment inthe remarks column) when I speak at the Central Hall nextFriday, for publication as a comprehensive programme subjectto this qualification that detailed alterations and adjustmentsmay be. required after individual consultations with theindustries concerned.      I shall however make it clear that atall costs the task laid down must be achieved.CONCLUSIONS24.     I  ask my colleagues to agree, therefore:-(i)    That industry should receive at least 24^ million tonsof Coal during the winter months;(ii)    That departments in allocating resources shoulddiscriminate,  if necessary,  in favour of industries and firms of special importance to the export trade;&apos;(iii)    That coko, coking coal and scrap, should be madeavailable to the iron and steel industry to enable it to maintain steel production at a level of 14 million ingot tons in 1948;(iv)    That the allocations of steel to tho production department with responsibilities for the export of metal products should be reviewed forthwith in orderto establish wh:-t additional-allocation must be madeto - carry out tho new programmes even at the cost ofsome slowing down or curtailment of the presentpriority programme;(v)    That-the steel allocation scheme should be at oncemodified so as to make a more suitable instrument forthe purposes it now has to fulfil, and to ensure thatsteel will bo available to meet the allocations;(vi)    That the Control of Engagement Order should be. sooperated as to give the textile industries the maximumopportunity of recruiting additional workers;(vii)    That I should limit the clothing ration to 4 coupons per month from 1st October to 1st March and that I should give a warning that, as far as can be seen, the rationwill have to be reduced to 3-g- per month from 1st March, 1948 to 1st September,  1948;(viii.)    That the cotton and wool textile industries should begiven special exemption from tho obligation tostagger working hours;(ix)    That the percentage of commercial vehicles exportedshould bo raised from 40 per cent,  to 50 per cent.(x)    That home market-sales of wireless sets, vacuumcleaners, hollow-ware, cutlery and similar goods should be reduced both to release goods for exports andto save materials and labour;(xi)    That the investment programme should bo reducedforthwith in order to release&apos; steel and other materials, components and labour for the export industries;
That an increased proportion of the output ofmachinery should he exported even at the cost of postponing the introduction of desirable changessuch as are involved in the clean milk policy;That the requirements of foreign exchange for thepurcha.se of raw materials to moot the export programme should be fully met.That there should be in each region a committee of senior officers of the production departments sittingunder the Chairmanship of the Board of Trade RegionalControllers and co-ordinating the efforts of departments to achieve the export task;That the Materials Committee should report as soon aspossible on the arrangements that are necessary toensure an adequate supply of packing materials,containers etc, for the export of goods and thatarrangements should be made to carry out their recommendations;That 1 should disclose the details of the export programme when I speak at the Central Hall,R, S, C oBoard of Trade, S.W. 1..5TH SEPTEMBER,  1947.(xiii)(xiv)(xv)(xvi)
