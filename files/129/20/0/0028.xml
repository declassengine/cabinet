THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF   HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;3  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   A ugust 1947 ^SECRET Copy No.CP. (47) 2286th August, 1947CABINETDEVELOPMENT OF NEW SOURCES OF FOOD supply memorandum by the Minister of food circulate for the information of my colleagues the following notes on the steps which have been or are&apos; being taken by my Department to develop new sources of food supply throughout the world.I. European countries. Before the war certain European countries, particularly Denmark,Holland and Poland, and the then existing Baltic States, were among our principal sources of dairy produce, bacon and eggs. My Department has made or is in process of making with all of these countries which still exist as separatenations, agreements which it is hoped will secure for us an important increasein supplies of these foods over the next three years. The virtual disappearance of Germany and Austria as markets for food supplies from a number of european countries, particularly in the Danube basin, has opened up the possibility of developing these countries as sources of supply to the United Kingdom.3. Denmark.^-Last July we succeeded in negotiating with Denmark long-term contracts for the bulk of her exportable surpluses of butter, bacon and eggs,as well as substantial supplies of meat. Further discussions have been held sinceas a result of which higher prices have been agreed to meet increased costs ofproduction and we have assured the Danes of our assistance in obtainingadditional feeding-stuffs. In return the Danes have undertaken to take various measures to increase exportable supplies. They have agreed as regards baconto pass on to producers the price increase paid by us and to maintain the subsidies on Danish grain sold to pig producers : as regards butter they have agreed notto sell more than 30,000 tons outside the United Kingdom and have introduced a combined margarine/butter ration as well as reducing the fat content of cheeseand milk for home consumption.We are hoping to obtain from Denmark about 50,000 tons of butter (over25 per cent of our imports) in the first nine months of 1947; in the year 1947-48the target for bacon is 75,000 tons (one-third of our total imports) though this may not be attained. We are also to get 85 per cent, of her exportable surplusof eggs over the next two years.4. Holland: Negotiations in March 1947 resulted in agreement by the Dutchto resume exports, though on a moderate scale at first, of eggs, bacon and milk products and other foods. The present agreement provides, inter alia, for 5,000tons of eggs between July 1947 and February 1948 (about 6 per cent, of a year&apos;total imports), for 5,000 tons of condensed milk and for at least 4,000 tons ofcheese, as well as large supplies of fruit pulp for jam making. There will befurther discussion in September covering exports in 1948 and 1949.5. Poland. Exports to .the United Kingdom of essential foods are a prominent feature of the three years&apos; agreement recently concluded between thetwo countries. The agreement provides for shipment of about 2,000 tons of eggs 2 per cent, of our annual imports) between end-April and end-September 1947.The Poles have already begun to supply eggs and, during the remainder of thefirst year of the agreement, they also expect to send 1,000 tons of poultry and25,000 tons of sugar (this is an addition of only some 1 per cent, to our supplies).They have undertaken that in the second and third years at least 50 per cent.34038 b
by value of their exports to the United Kingdom will be from a list of specifiedgoods which includes bacon, butter, eggs, oilseed and vegetable oils, sugar and poultry. r, -.6. Hungary. I sent a representative to Hungary as early as the summer of 1946 on an exploratory visit. The first important deal was the purchase of3,000 tons of turkeys and other poultry. In May of this year a delegation visitedBudapest with authority to negotiate long-term contracts. At that time, withharvest prospects still uncertain, the Hungarians were unable to undertakedefinite commitments but they have now sent a delegation to London to resume negotiations for a three years&apos; agreement covering the export to the UnitedKingdom of bacon, eggs, poultry, lard, sunflower oil and other items. Exportsof bacon could begin in November, on a small scale, and in the year beginning1st August, 1948, the Hungarians could supply a minimum of 10,000 tons (about  per cent, of our present annual imports). They could also send 3,000-4,000 tonsof eggs in the period September 1947 to July 1948, and greatly increasedquantities the following year. Poultry could reach 6,000 tons in&quot; the seasonbeginning September next.&apos; 7. Yugoslavia. Exports have so far been limited by food shortages butthe harvest situation and live-stock prospects are now better than for manyyears. Following a visit to Yugoslavia by one of my officials, the yugoslav government have expressed their willingness in principle to supply us over thenext few years with substantial quantities of foOd-stuffs, including cereals, meat,bacon, lard, eggs, poultry and fruit. A general agreement covering such exportswill, I hope, be negotiated with the Yugoslav Economic Delegation which isexpected in London later this month, and I am arranging to send a delegation to Yugoslavia in September to settle contracts for food purchases. Meanwhiletwo food experts will visit Yugoslavia on my behalf to make various technicalenquiries.8. Roumania.-Arrangements to send . representatives last summer topurchase maize and other food-stuffs were cancelled when it was seen that the harvest had been ruined by drought. Prospects for the coming harvest are not good. There has been sufficient rainfall to avert widespread failure, but large areas have either been left imtilled or are carrying poor crops. I have, however,arranged for One of my officials to visit Roumania this month to survey theposition and report. v9. Bulgaria.-La.st summer, and again this year, one of my representativeshas visited Bulgaria. .10. Turkey. One of my representatives will be visiting Turkey to investigate the possibilities of obtaining new exports such as meat and oilseeds from Turkey.Two experts from the egg trade have been in Istanbul examining the possibilitiesof building up an export trade in eggs to the United Kingdom. We have takenall the eggs offered this season and these have already arrived.11. Russia. &apos;Although the Secretary of Overseas Trade has had to return from Moscow without the contracts for which we had hoped, nevertheless agree-inent was reached with the Russians on prices and contract terms for 1 million tons of cereals, from the 1947 crop. The Russians would have undertaken tooffer us still larger quantities of cereals from the 1948-50 harvests. Even though a comprehensive trade agreement with Russia may not be possible, I still hopethat I may be able to purchase a large tonnage of cereals as between willingbuyer and willing seller as there is every indication that with a large crop Rus*siawill wish to export cereals this year. The only other commodity which theRussians have offered to supply is canned fish. Before the latest Moscow talks Ihad already bought comparatively small quantities of canned salmon and cannedcrabmeat from their 1946 and 1947 packs. No agreement on prices for future-packs was reached in Moscow but the quantities offered from the 1948-50 packswould be a valuable addition to our supplies and for them we still have a usefulbargaining weapon in our ability to let the Russians haye tinplate to can partof their pack.II. Eire12. Immediately before the war Eire supplied us annually with some33,000 tons of beef (5 per cent, of our imports), 17,000 tons of eggs (10 percent, of imports), 21,000 tons Of butter (4 per cent, of imports) and 25,000 tonsof bacon (6-g per cent, of imports).   Egg supplies have now declined to 12,000 tons
(which, however, is nearly 20 per cent, of our imports) and supplies of beefhave almost, and those of bacon and butter have entirely, disappeared. Clearlytherefore a restoration of Eire supplies even to pre-war level would be well worthwhile. I recently sent to Eire two agricultural economists for the purpose ofinvestigating the food and agricultural position in that country and making recommendations as to what measures might be taken to develop exports offood to the United Kingdom. Following consideration of this Report by all departments concerned, I have now circulated to the Lord Presidents Com-mittee a paper (L.P. (47) 135) which puts forward a number of specific proposalsdesigned to increase food production for export which, it is suggested, should form the basis of negotiations with the Eire Government in the near future.III.-The Far East13. Indonesia. Following representations by the United States theI.E.F.C. decided to send a mission to Java of representatives of the UnitedStates, Netherlands and Indonesia. We insisted ,that the United Kingdom, shouldbe full members of such a mission and finally won our way. The Mission&apos;s depotindicated that out of a total stock of old sugar amounting to about 900,000 tons,some 200.000 tons could be made available for export, provided the politicalsituation permitted. The plantations have suffered gravely from neglect duringJapanese occupation and it seems unlikely that any exportable surplus will beavailable for some time to come. This applies also to tea. The present pro-ductive capacity is not more than 20 per cent, of pre-war : under settled political conditions and with good management production might be restored to 80percent, of pre-war in 3 years&apos; time.The recent deterioration of the situation in Indonesia, however, has renderedestimates of export availabilities comparatively valueless. With the outbreakof actual fighting and the possibility of the Republicans employing scorched-earthtactics such stocks as have been reported may well disappear, and it is evidentthat this potential source of valuable food supplies has been lost to us until such time as peaceful conditions have been restored.14. South-East Asia. Everything that can be done hasT)een done to assistthe rehabilitation of rice production in South-East Asia. Recovery can only be slow and is hampered in Burma by administrative disorganisation, dacoity andthe fact that much land has gone out of cultivation; in Siam by financial andpolitical instability, lack of consumer goods and land going out of cultivation;in French Indo-Chrna by civil war. Meanwhile populations are expanding and supplies will therefore fall short of demand even when pre-war supplies are againachieved. There is thus a great need to expand cultivation of rice in these areas beyond the pre-war level and a fairly urgent decision is needed as tothe Department which should assume primary responsibility for prosecuting such development.My Department has under urgent consideration the question of revisingmethods of procurement of rice from Siam. At present any supplies comingout of that country are largely the result of conniving at smuggling. I am not sure that the remedy is not to go over to a free market in spite of the priceinflation that would result.In view of the importance of the Far East as a source of supply of many important foods, I am arranging to set up a small office in Singapore to facilitate the flow of items such as sugar, tea, fats, canned fruit, spices, &amp;c, as they becomeprocurable.15. China. Restoration of exports of important foods such as eggs andsoya beans from China is impeded by the financial and political chaos in China.The possibilities of resuming imports from Formosa of items such as sugar,fruit and tea are being examined but progress will probably be subject to thesame impediments as operate in the Chinese mainland.IV.-Middle East16. At my request enquiries have been made by the Sudan Department ofAgriculture into the possibilities of large-scale rice production in the upperreaches of the Nile in Southern Sudan. Discussions have been held with arepresentative of the Sudan Veterinary Department about the long-term prospects of obtaining frozen beef and mutton from the Sudan. The Sudan Governmenthave started measures to improve the cattle stock and eradicate cattle diseases34038 b 2
/but it will take a good many years before the meat will be fit to bear a satisfactoryhealth certificate. I propose to send an expert to Sudan in the autumn to investigate on the spot the possibilities of beef and mutton production. Hewill also be able to advise on the construction of killing and freezing facilities and transport. In conjunction with the British Middle East Office in Cairoactive consideration is being given to the long-term prospects of obtainingincreased production of oilseeds in the Middle East, particularly in the Jeziraregion of Syria and Northern Iraq when the new irrigation schemes in these districts are completed. A small Food Mission will probably tour the middle east later in the year. Meantime we are emphasising the short-term need to achieve self-sufficiency in cereals production in the Middle East, though efforts in this respect have been partially offset by a drought which has affected Palestine,Transjordan, Syria, Cyrenaica and Arabia.V. Africa17. Southern Rhodesia. ^Discussions were held early this year with thePrime Minister of Southern Rhodesia on the possibilities of obtaining more food from that country. I intimated our willingness to enter into long-term contracts for the supply up to 1949 of eggs, milk products, meat and bacon. further discussions are planned with the High Commissioner. I also discussed with theSouthern Rhodesian Ministers of Finance and Commerce a scheme for themechanised cultivation of groundnuts, the acreage to be increased to 400,000acres if suitable irrigation arrangements can be made. Expert investigation of the technical problems involved is being undertaken by the Southern rhodesian government.18. Oilseed Production in A frica. I do not propose to elaborate in this paper on the East African groundnut project which is already sufficiently wellknown to my colleagues. It is, of course, one of the most hopeful sources wehave of a really substantial addition to our supplies of fats. Work is going ahead on the project which, if the acreage gGals can be achieved, will provide86,000 tons (in terms of oil) in 1949, 177,000 tons in 1950 and 231,000 tons in1951 and thereafter. Railways have now been constructed in the first areascheduled for planting, and clearance of bush was begun in April, there havingbeen some delay in obtaining the necessary tractors. It may be possible toplant 75,000 acres in 1947.I have already announced in the House of Commons (16th May) the intentionof His Majesty&apos;s Government to promote legislation to establish an overseas food Corporation, which will before August 1948 take over from the presentManaging Agency the management of the groundnut scheme as well as havingpower to initiate schemes of large-scale agricultural production overseas.. - The West African Oilseed Mission of 1946 indicated potentialities for pro-duction in Gambia which is under-populated and has relatively small areassuitable for mechanised groundnut cultivation. A second Mission of agriculturalbusiness experts has gone to West Africa to examine the possibility of schemesfor production of groundnuts and other crops not only in Gambia but alsoin the Northern territories of the Gold Coast and the Bornu province of Nigeria.British Colonies in East and West Africa, Palestine, Cyprus, Mauritius,Jamaica and Fiji have been asked to report urgently on the possibilities of producing linseed over the next five years without interfering with other foodcrops. Seed trials are being carried out in West Africa. Production on an experimental scale only will be undertaken in East Africa as more extensivecultivation could only be at the expense of other food production. Productionin Palestine could only be at the expense of cereals for local consumption anda substantial price incentive would be necessary. A limited experimental schemefor linseed, particularly at high altitude, is to be undertaken in Jamaica in. theautumn, but costs of production are high and it is unlikely that private cultivationwould be developed. Colonial territories in East and West Africa have alsobeen asked to investigate the possibility of starting or expanding productionof soya beans for export as an oilseed as soya-bean oil is a suitable substitute for linseed oil for some industrial purposes.VI. South and Central America19. Uruguay. Advantage is being taken of the Uruguayan Economic andFinancial Mission to discuss the possibilities of obtaining additional suppliesof foods.     The Uruguayan production has not, however, recovered from the
disastrous drought of 1942-43, and it is unlikely that very much more than weare already getting will be immediately available. Subject to agreement being reached on the question of her sterling balances, there is a prospect of a meatcontract up to 1950. In the long run Uruguay may also be able to increaseexports of eggs, poultry and dairy products, but the quantities are likely to be small for some time.*20. Mexico and Guatemala.-As a result of the closing of the United states to imports of cattle from Mexico, the possibility.has arisen of our obtaining supplies of meat from that source. A representative of my Department recentlyvisited Mexico and Guatemala and reported formally on the prospects of obtainingmeat from both these sources. Purchasing in Guatemala has already commencedand it is anticipated that procurement in Mexico will begin as soon as thenecessary formalities in connection with health certificates have been settled.We hope that from these two sources we shall obtain about 20,000 tons in thefirst year- an addition of say 2 per cent, to our carcase meat supplies.Ministry of Food, S.W. 1,6th August, 1947.J.
