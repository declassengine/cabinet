(XsU. 1*5-7- *7. ;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly Umited. 133It is issued for the personal use top SECRET Copy No..-.CP. (hi) 21528TH JULY.  19h.7CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE IRON AND STEEL industry memorandum bv the L,or,d Prres,idrent of t,he Counqil. andthe Minister of Sun-plyThe Cabinet,  at their meeting on 2b th July (CM. (hi) 6h,th conclusions, Minute 2) agreed to have a further discussion aboutthe reorganisation of the iron and steel industry, and we thinkthat it would facilitate this further discussion if we summarisebriefly the alternative courses which emerged from thediscussions of 20th July.Acquisition of Physical Assets2. The Cabinet, at their meetings on 21+th and 28th April, 19*4-7*(CM.(h7) 39th Conclusions, Minute 6, and h-Ot-h Conclusions,Minute 2) discussed the manner in which appropriate sections ofthe iron and steel industry might be transferred to the    ownership of the nation on the basis of proposals put forward by the.Minister of Supply (&apos;C.P.(h7) 123 and 132).     The Cabinet thenaccepted the view that in this particular case any comprehensiveacquisition of physical assets on the lines adopted in the caseof coal would involve, great complications (e.g. as regardsseverance and the necessity for substantial management-adjustments) and could only be effected over a long period.Throughout that time powers of potential state acquisition wouldoverhang the industry and there would be continued uncertainty,and loss of incentive.     The arguments against proceeding bythe acquisition of physical assets appear to us to be decisive.Acquisition of Selected Companies3* As the Cabinet have already agreed,  the most practicalmethod of securing public ownership is the acquisition by theGovernment of all the shares in selected companies on the lines suggested in C.P.(h7)  123.     At the same time it would be inevitable that the energies of many of the - active personalitiesin the industry would be diverted away from, concentration on.-maximum steel output- and the execution of development schemes to opposing Government&apos;s plans or to considering their ownfuture - e,g. by such means as the promotion of schemes hiving
off sections of their undertakings under continued private ownership.     There would thus be a real danger that in the critical year or two immediately ahead the national economy would be seriously handicapped through a continued shortageof steel.     We cannot afford to run this risk.Inaction *U. A postponement of any decision about the reorganisation of the iron and steel industry has certain attractions, but ithas its dangers from the practical and political points of view.&apos;On the one hand the industry might be operating under the disadvantage of a state of uncertafrit;/, which would continue fromSession to Session until the end of the present Parliament since it is doubtful if we could carry through legislation if wecompletely retired from action next Session.     On the   otherhand,  a decision to take no action might leave the industry to suppose that all danger of nationalisation was removed with consequent difficulties of exercising effective government control.     Moreover, we have clearly told the Federation thatwe proposed to take action on certain lines;    and they wouldconstrue no action at all next Session as a sign of weaknessand would&apos; have this in mind in any future negotiations.Politically, inaction could be represented as the policy ofa rather weak Government which was scared by the iron and steelinterests and possibly scared by the United States.     We shouldnot like to have to face the Party with this policy or lack, ofpolicy.Corn-promise outlined in CP. (Li7)  2125* There remains the compromise which we put before&apos; our colleagues at the meeting of the Cabinet on 2L(.th July.      It hasthe substantial advantage that control of the iron and steelindustry becomes fully vested in the Government and it would be easier for Government to acquire the necessary technical knowledge to enable complete socialisation to be effected, ifit were thought desirable, during the next Parliament.     Manyof the Party may wish that we could have gone further, thoughothers in the Party favour a moderate line.     But we shall atleast have taken a definite step forward on the road towardssocialisation without running the risk of jeopardising steeloutput at a critical time and in co-operation with the industrywho would acquiesce, thus tending to disarm the Opposition;and the way will be paved for a final step at a later date.H.M.J.W.28th July, 191+7.
