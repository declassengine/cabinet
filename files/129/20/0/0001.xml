THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1947SECRET Capy^No.,31CP. (47) 201\WK July, 1947CABINETSUPPLY OF PAPER FOR ACTIONMemorandum by the Home secretary at their meeting on 15th May (CM. (47) 47th Conclusions, Minute 5) theCabinet invited me, in consultation with the Lord Chancellor and the Presidentof the Board of Trade, to consider whether means other than the introduction of specific legislation could not be devised for preventing the publication of A ction,and enquired if it would be practicable for the President, with the authority ofthe Cabinet, to refuse to license the delivery of paper for the purpose of publishingAction.2. This question has been further considered by the President of the Boardof Trade, who is of opinion that his powers under the Paper Control Orders arewide enough to enable him to refuse to license the delivery of any paper forthe publication of Action but that, even if he exercised his powers m this way,the paper might still be able to appear because the publishers might getconsiderable quantities of paper from merchants&apos; and printers&apos; stocks.3. The President of the Board of Trade has, however, suggested an alter-native method of preventing the republication of Action by adding a furthercondition to the Paper Control Orders. At present no periodical may be publishedusing more than 8 cwt. of paper in four months unless it was first publishedprior to 16th August, 1940. The President of the Board of Trade thinks itwould be possible to amend the Order to make it an offence to publish anyperiodical unless it were published both prior to 16th August, 1940 (as at present),and also in, say, the month of May, 1947. This alteration wTould render unlawfulthe reappearance of certain pre-August 1940 periodicals which the Presidenthas no wish to stop and it would therefore be necessary for him to establish licensing system for the publication of such papers. In practice he would beprepared to grant a licence for the publication of any periodical which appeared before 16th August, 1940, except A ction. Such a procedure would be contraryto the general practice of the Board of Trade in administering the Paper ControlOrders and the President has informed me that he would agree to adopt it onlyon specific direction from the Cabinet.4. As I have previously pointed out (CP. (47) 135), there are strong objections to imposing a political censorship in any form, and these objectionsare not lessened if the censorship is imposed under the authority of a defence regulation the purpose of which is the saving of paper. These objections are applicable to the present proposal, and in addition it would seem likely to giverise to the most serious practical difficulties in administration. When it became known, as it must, that the real reason for the procedure is to exercise discrimina-tion against Action, there would be pressure from many quarters for similar actionagainst other periodicals and we should have to justify our action in grantingj&amp;ggfer to many periodicals whose claims would not be easily defensible onceyj^l!sCrimination starts. I could not, for my part, undertake to advise on theadministration of such a provision and T cannot recommend my colleagues toadopt the proposal.J. C.
