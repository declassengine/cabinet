(kl)  2135th August. 19h7.CABINETINDIAN STERLING BALANCESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Indian sterling balances amount to  1,160 millions.2. As an essential part of the settlement now being negotiated, these balances will be blocked by agreement, thoughIndia, unlike Egypt, will probably remain a member of the sterling area.3* The Indians have asked for releases of  1+8.5 mil-lionsfrom the blocked account for the remainder of 1947*      On my instructions this request has been.rejected, and a figure of 35 millions has been offered as the maximum which we can release.The Indians have recommended their Government to accept this.1+. Fortunately, only about  15 millions of this sum will be spent in dollars,  and nearly all of it on food;    the rest will beused to meet sterling expenditure on India&apos;s purchases of e.g.Australian wheat,  and exports from this country.5. No commitment for further releases after the end of 19h7has been,  or will be, mode in the present negotiations, nor are wecommitted to recognise the total, without further cancellation oradjustment.6.  30 millions of the blocked account will be available to.the Reserve Bank of India,  as necessary, as a working balance.But this sum will not be a &quot;release11 to meet current expenditure and it will be the Bank&apos;s liability to keep it replenished as port of its reserves mainly to cover the note issue.7. The rote of interest on the balances will not be allowedto increase.      More than three-quarters of them earn only one-halfper cent.      The rest ore in long-term British government securities.8. I do not regard the proposed interim settlement astoo generous,  either in relation to the total of the balances,or in the very exceptional political circumstances of Indiato-day.H.D.Treasury&apos; Chambers,  S.W.1.5th August,  19h7.
