At a meeting on 4th August,, the Defence Committee(D. 0. (hi) 18th Meeting) considered proposals made by theMinister of Defence.Overseas Military Expenditureh-     The Minister of Defence reported that, the -maximumprssible reduction that can be made in the strength of our forces overseas is as follows:-(a) A reduction of 133,000 in British troops by 31stDecember, 1947*(b) A reduction of 34,000 in non-United Kingdom troops at present being employed in the Middle East andSouth East Asia, and paid for by the british exchequer, by 31st December, 1947.      This is the equivalent, in terms of cost, of approximately21,000 British troops.(c) A reduction of a further 77P000 British troopsbetween&apos;1st January, 1948, and 31st March, 1948.5.      The Defence Committee recommend to the Cabinet:-(a) That the reductions in paragraph h above beaccepted.      -
. (b) That, in the light of urgent representations fromthe United States Government, the timing of theproposed withdrawals from Greece (some 6,000)and Italy (some 27,000) should be subject to discussion with the United States authorities.The object of these discussions will be to draw up an agreed programme which will permit ofthese withdrawals being completed by 3*1 stDecember, 1947*(c) That the leave scheme known as LIAP (under which men of longer service overseas who are not due for posting home for, some time ahead, are given a month&apos;s leave at home) should be reduced toa trickle from 1st November, 1947, and abolishedaltogether from 1st January, 1948, in order to ease the strain on shipping.(d) That the withdrawal of German prisoners of war fromthe Middle East should be slowed down in orderto permit&quot; the increased flow of British personnel.(e) That the Secretary of State for India and^theSecretary of State for Uar should make - arrange-ments to ensure that priorities for passagesfrom India were -such as to enable the withdrawalof British service troops and. their families from india to be carried out by the planned date.(f) That the Governments in India should be invitedto allow the retention of British stores in india for a -considerable period beyond April, 1948,when they are at present due to be withdrawn.6.      The Defence Committee were of the opinion that in announcing these reductions to the House on Wednesday theproposed reductions should be stated in general terms, no details being given of the particular theatres from whichtroops were being withdrawn.Reduction in the Total Size of the Armed Forces7*      The Minister of Defence was able to recommend that theestimated strength for the Armed Forces on 31st March, 1948,which at present stands at 1,087,000, should be reduced to1,007,000.8*.    The Defence Committee considered this recommendation at length and were of the opinion that it is impracticable toreduce this figure further by speeding up release.      Such a procedure would involve withdrawing from the three Servicesmore trained men and would merely aggravate the principaldifficulty with which they are faced.      It was suggested,however, that some further&quot;reduction of the total strengthmight be achieved by making a temporary reduction in thenumber of men who are being taken into the Services underthe National Service Acts.      They accordingly invited theMinister of Defence to consider whether a proportion of thepresent National Service intake might not be left temporarily in essential industries.
9.     The Defence Committee recommend that the Cabinet:-&apos;(a) Accept for the time being the figure of 1,007,000as the estimated strength of the Armed Forcesat 31st March, -1948.(b) Take note that the Minister of Defence isexamining the possibility of reducing this figure still further by. leaving a proportionof the present National Service intake inessential industries.C.
