CP.(47) 2275TH AUGUST .  1947CABINET-RAT,AATf!E OTP PAYMENTS AND CONVERTIBILITYMemorandum by the   Chancellor of the ExchequerLast Priday I undertook to circulate for information amemorandum analysing the effect upon our dollar resources ofour convertibility obligations (CM. (47) 68th Conclusions,Conclusion (-10)).2.     This is a complicated and technical question, and I, think it may be simplest to circulate complete tables showingwhere the U.3.  dollars have gone during the last year and the drain upon our resources.     The U.S.  dollar position is shownin Table I, and the total gold and dollar position inTable II.3.     Table I is analysed to shbw:-(i) the U.K.  trading deficit with U.S.A.  (item 4)(ii) the U.S.  dollars which we have had to provide inrespect of U.K. trading transactions with canada and the other Americas (Item 5)(iii) the dollars which we have gained and spent as a :result of our arrangements with. european countries (item 6).(iv) the U.S. dollars which we have provided forsterling area countries (item 7)4* The same form of analysis is shown in Table II, expanded to cover gold and Canadian dollars as well as U.S.  dollars.5.     No question of &quot;convertibility&quot; arises on (i).     On(ii) likewise there is no serious question of &quot;convertibility&quot;We have to pay these countries in.dollars or their equivalent.We have not enough   exports to send, to them to pay for our imports and they will not accept blocked &quot;sterling.     In our negotiations with.Argneina, for example, last autumn, thefirst essential condition imposed by the Argentine Government &apos;was that we should pay for our supplies in the currency .whichthey determined - either convertible sterling or gold ordollars.,    My colleagues will observe from Item 7 of Table IIthat of our total gold and dollar drain of $1,630 millions inthe first half of 1947 (excluding Bretton Vifoods&apos; subscriptions)$1,395 millions represents the U.K. trading deficit withthe Americas.     This is a heavy increase over the figure of&quot; The circulation of this paper has been, strictly limited,It is issued for the personal use oi..Jmd!....Adtl^!M^...J^.TOP SECRET Copy No.
$815 millions for the second half of 1946, hut this resultsboth from increased supplies and heavily increase^ prices.6.     In our dealings with European countries the question of&quot;convertibility&quot; is significant.     My colleagues will note from Item 5 of Table II&apos; that we secured $120 millions net ofgold and dollars in the second half of 1946 from thesecountries, but paid out $30 millions net in the first half of1947.     This rapid change for the worse is related partly to thenon-recurrence of special payments which we received from France earlier;   partly to the worsening of our general balanceof payments position in the first half of this year and partly to the arrangements made in anticipation of 15th July.     If we&apos;had had no &quot;convertibility&quot; obligations, we should have savedsome dollars here.    . But the quantities are not large inrelation to the total gold and dollar drain (see Items 5 and7 of Table II).7.     There has been a substantial change for the wors&apos;e inrelation to the sterling area (item 7 of Table I and Item 4 of table II).     Sterling area countries have taken from us $205millions in gold and dollars net in the first half of this year,whereas we obtained from them $155 millions in the second halfof 1946.     This is a serious matter and the purpose of theagreements which we have been negotiating with these countries has been to prevent this drain from continuing.8.     I would, however, remind my colleagues that thesecountries bank with us.     This is the essential characteristicof the sterling area.     They gave us their dollar earningsduring the whole war and this played a big part in enabling usto conduct the war.     Moreover, my colleagues will note whichcountries are mainly responsible for the deterioration.     Ofthe $360 millions deterioration in tho sterling area as a whole(Item 4 of Table II), from a gain of $155 millions in the second half of 1946 to a loss of $205 millions in the first half of$130 millions is attributable to South Africa;South Africa is adopting a very free importpolicy - If we could give them more exports theywould buy less from U.S.A.$65 millions is attributable to Australia.About $60 millions is attributable to India - mainly for food literally to prevent famine.About $100 millions is attributable to the Coloniesother than Malaya;    they must have supplies from the americas and, of course, we have a special responsibility for them.     This particular drainwould haye been reduced very heavily,  if we had had more textiles ourselves and there had thus been no need for them to buy in dollars from Japan.These four items cover $355 millions out of a total of$360 millions.1947:-(a)(b)(c)(d)
9. These Tables show that, where we hove furnished Dollarother than for direct purchases for the United Kingdom, we havedone so almost entirely as the hankers for the Sterling Area..Had we not done this,  the Sterling- Area would have &quot;broken up,because their balances represent, for all practical purposes,the whole of their foreign exchange resources, including thebacking for their note issue.In the second half of 191+6 we gained $155 million ofgold and dollars from the rest of the Sterling Area, and sooffset &quot;by this amount our own trading deficit with the Americas.Even in the first half of .19U7? when this gain became a loss,  it accounted for only about -g-th of our total dollar expenditure.      Almost the whole of the other Jths have gone to fill our own stomachs and to stock our own factories.H.D.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1*5th August,  1947.
