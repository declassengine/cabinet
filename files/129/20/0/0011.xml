AshS E C R E TCP. (1+7)  21122ND JULY,  191+7CABINETPROPOSAL TO CHARGE WAY-LEAVES FOR OIL PIPE-lines in PALESTINEMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power support the recommendation in paragraph 9 of theColonial Secretary&apos;s memorandum (CP. (1+7) 198) to the effectthat the right of the Palestine Government to make charges for pipe-line facilities should be approved in principle.It would certainly not be reasonable that palestine should be debarred from obtaining revenue from the oil companies in -respect of pipe-lines on the same footing asadjacent countries.      It is, however,  in my view important that the charges which the Palestine Government may wish tolevy should be related to services rendered or inconveniencecaused.      In other words, it would not be desirable that way-leaves should be assessed on a purely arbitrary basis, and inaccordance with the supposed capacity of the oil companies topay.      It must be remembered that the Palestine Government aregranting free transit facilities to the Trans-Arabian Pipe-lineCompany and that it is desirable that future pipe-lines laid hyBritish companies across Palestine should remain competitive.COPY NO.E.
