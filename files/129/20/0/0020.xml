(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET-r- -- -7C.P,,(h7) ,220 COPY NO.        j50TH JULY.  19U7        -cabinet national CRISIS SCHEME FOR INCREASING PRODUCTIONMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service at the present stage of the Nation&apos;s affairs,what is needed is an immediate increase in the production of dollar earning and dollar saving goods.     This increase must come in the next few months.2, It is impossible in such a short period to obtainincreased production by reorganisation and re-equipment.     The .only course, as after Dunkirk, is to secure as a crisismeasure an immediate increase of output by an immediatelengthening of hours of work.     The present negotiated hours would not be altered, all additional hours worked being   paid for at overtime rates.     The increased hours would only bemaintained as a temporary crisis measure until such time as our balance of trade began to right itself and our economic position improve.3* The increase of hours cannot,  however, operateimmediately over the whole of industry.      It is no useincreasing the hours of work in industries which are alreadyshort of their raw materials.     The sole effect of increasedhours in such industries would be speedily to create short-time work or even unemployment because their raw materialstocks had been exhausted.h* The need is therefore for a scheme under whichhours of work are first expanded in those industries whichhave adequate supplies of raw materials and whose output isdollar earning or dollar saving in itself or is a pre-requisit^to expansion in other such industries.      I attach the outline of such a scheme.5. I appreciate that increased hours of work in the selected industries might cause workers to leave them for-   employment in industries working normal hours.     This question would probably be of importance in the textile areas, wherethe five-day week was introduced largely as an attraction to women.     The position would have to be watched carefully and ifnecessary (although&quot; I would deprecate this) a &quot;ring-fence&quot; putround the selected industries.G.A.I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W.  1.,30th July, 191+7.
ANNEXNATIONAL CRISIS SCHEME FOR INCREASING production* There should he an immediate increase in the hours ofwork in those industries in which an immediate increase of output can he secured and maintained, and whose output would bring an immediate relief to the dollar crisis either&apos;throughdirect sale for hard currencies or by saving dollar imports,or as being a pre-requisite for the expansion of the output ofother such goods.2. Immediately output in the industries in the first group has reached a level at which the expansion of output ofother industries can be secured, there should be an immediate increase of hours of work in those industries also,3* The additional hours would he paid for at overtimerates in accordance with current agreements, thus preserving the present negotiated.hours.J+. Industries in the first category might be -CoalminingCotton spinningWool spinningJute spinningIron foundriesHeavy electrical pland and miningmachinery manufactureFreightLocomotive and wagon construction and repairPlant and equipment for gas undertakings and coal/oil conversion and otherportions of the engineering industryenjoying first priority for steel.5* As soon as the output of coal, yarn, castings,  etc,permitted, the hours should be increased in -Any sections of iron and steel manufacturewhere there is undermanningCottonWool and worsted weavingDyeing and finishingHosiery -and knitwearShipbuildingAgricultural engineeringMotor vehicles and general engineering tothe limit of available supplies ofsteelForgings and castingsSome increase of hours in transport to enable the additional production to be moved might also be required.6e The procedure would be for the Government, afterconsultation with the Economic Planning Board, to announcefirst of all the list of industries in which an immediate increase of hours should be requested and subsequently fromtime to time the other industries from which additional
output was wanted and was practicable.     The Government&apos;request would be referred immediately to the Joint negotiating machinery in the industry which should determine the methodby which the increased hours should be secured, e.g. Saturday morning working, Sunday working, extended hours three days a week, etc.7. As to the amount by which hours should be increased,the Government should indicate to each industry the annual(or monthly) production required (e.g. in million tons of coalor pounds of cotton yarn) and the industries should be leftto work out the hours required to hit the target.8. It might be necessary to impose sanctions onindividuals who-refuse to work the overtime asked for, butthis is a matter that will need consideration in the lightof experience.
