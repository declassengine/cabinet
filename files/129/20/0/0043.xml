THIS DOCUMENTISTHEJPROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 government cabinet    -BALANCE OF PAYMENTS;STANDARDISATION IN TPIE MOTOR industry memorandum by the Minister of supply at the Balance of Payments Meeting on the20th August, it was suggested that the export of motor carswould be greatly facilitated if the manufacturers could agree on a substantial measure of standardisation of constituent parts.     I was ashed to consider and report urgently what steps could be taken to induce manufacturers to accept suchstandardisation.2. Standardisation hrs in fact been continuously underdiscussion with the National Advisory Council for the MotorManufacturing Industry and considerable progress has been madeboth in the elimination of.an unnecessary variety of components and in concentration on fewer models.3* The recent revisionof motor car taxation has proved an inducement to a far wider degree of concentrationwithin individual firms than was hitherto possible.     Mostof the principal manufacturers have announced their intentionto concentrate on a single model or at most two models.4. Further action to increase standardisation and to rationalise the industry must be in the following directions -(1)   The&quot; increased standardisation- of components.But there are limits to the advantages which this course maybe expected to yield;    determined to some extent by thenumber of items which can be produced during the life of thetools;(2)   5?he concentration by each firm on one model only.-The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use ot..^^^^%m.i^lhd^ri266TOP SECRET23RD AUGUST.  lQh-7
(3)    The manufacture of the same model by severalfirms.(h)    The elimination, if necessary, of some firms engaged in the production of the least exportable models.These changes could be effected by the selective allocation of raw materials. -5* It may be desirable to stimulate exports by fixing a maximum lj,mit to the number of cars produced for home use,and thereafter by allocating raw materials to firms on thebasis of export achieved. : :6.      .        I should,  however, warn my colleagues thrt it wouldbe unwise to expect immediate and spectacular results.     Forinstance, the production of a single model by more than onemanufrcturer would involve complete re-tooling with consequentdislocation in-production which might last for more than^ twelvemonths.     To a considerable degree this would also be true of standardisation by an individual manufacturer.      It-is alsoimperative to avoid over-drastic-, action which would causesevere loss of production and   of highly profitable exportsat this vital time,7. I have summoned representatives of the industry toa meeting next week to inform thern of the measures I have in .mind.      I will report as-soon as possible on the result of themeeting.J.W.Ministry of Supply, W.C. 2.,23rd August, 19h7.
