In his formal opening speech, Mr. Myrddin-Evans gave a brief account ofthe stewardship of the Governing Body since the 27th Session of the Conferencein Paris in October/November, 1945.

He also made mention of the negotiationswith the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations in the following terms :&quot; Those negotiations took place on 28th May and 29th May last andresulted in the draft agreement.which is before you for your approval.That agreement has also been submitted by the Economic and social council to the Assembly of the United Nations and if, as we confidentlyanticipate, it is approved by the Assembly as well as by this Conference,it will enable us to co-operate fully with the United Nations in the pursuit of our common aims while retaining to this Organisation that measure of independence which we regard as essential for the proper carrying on ofour own work.&quot;Mr. Myrddin-Evans concluded :&quot; I repeat what has become to me an article of faith. I have the mostprofound conviction that the International Labour Organisation becauseof its Constitution, because&apos; of its record, because of the ideals which itembodies and the faith on which it was founded, can make a biggeicontribution to the attainment and preservation of those aims the liberty of the individual and the dignity of. the human soul than any othersecular organisation yet born or thought of.  It is in this sure and certain- hope that on behalf of the Governing Body I declare open the 29th Sessionof the International Labour Conference and wish it God speed.&quot;

The Conference appointed the following Committee to report on the credentials of delegates :Mr. G. Amado (Brazilian Government delegate),Mr. D. S. Erulkar (Indian Employers&apos; delegate), andMr. Leon Jouhaux (French Workers&apos; delegate).Mr. R- S.

The Committee reported during the Conference that the number of State.Members of the International Labour Organisation represented at theConference was 46 and the total number of delegates was 159.14. The following objections, to the credentials of delegates were submittedto the Credentials Committee :(i) An objection concerning the credentials of the Indian Workers&apos; delegateand Indian Workers&apos; advisers, lodged by the Indian Federation ofLabour.(ii) An objection concerning the credentials of the members of the UruguayanWorkers&apos; delegation, lodged by the General Workers&apos; Union of Uruguay.(hi) Three objections concerning the credentials of the Greek Workers&apos;delegate and adviser lodged respectively by the French Workers&apos;delegate, by the United Kingdom Workers&apos; delegate, and on behalf of. &quot; the legal Executive of the General Confederation of Labour elected by the Eighth Trade Union Congress &quot;.15.

The CredentialsCommittee concluded that no proof had been submitted to it substantiating the contention that the Workers&apos; delegate and his advisers had been nominatedin violation of the ,terms of the Constitution of the Organisation and
Recommended the Conference to reject the protest. The Committee&apos;s report was adopfed by the Conference without opposition.16. The objection concerning the credentials of the Workers&apos;, delegate fromUruguay was withdrawn.17.

The Conference had before it requests for re-admission to the InternationalLabour Organisation from Nicaragua and El Salvador. As Members of theUnited Nations they, too, were entitled to avail themselves of the provisionsof paragraph 1 of Article 3 of the Constitution of the Organisation&apos;as amendedat the 27th Session of the Conference, and the Conference expressed a similarhope that they would do so and be represented as Members of the Organisationat the 30th Session. -SELECTION COMMITTEE20. At an early stage the Conference, as required by its Standing Orders,appointed a Selection Committee whose duty it was &quot; to arrange the programmeof the Conference, to fix the time and agenda of the plenary sittings, to make proposals relating to the setting up and composition of other Committees, and
to report to the Conference on any other questions requiring a decision fqr thPproper conduct of its business&quot;. This Committee, nominated by the&apos;three groups in the Conference, consisted of 16 members nominated by the Govern-ment Group, 8 members nominated by the Employers&apos; Group and 8 membersnominated by the Workers&apos; Group.

On the recommendation of the Selection Committee, 6 main committees were set up, as follows :I. Standing Orders Committee, to which should be referred for consideration a Note prepared by the International Labour Office on the use of theSpanish language.It was decided that the Committee should be composed of 8 Goverar,       ment representatives, 4 Employers&apos; representatives and 4 Workers&apos;representatives. &apos;II.

Grossmith). Sir John Forbes Watson(substitutes: Brigadier-General A. C. Baylay, Mr. K. J. Burton) represented the United Kingdom Employers and Sir Joseph Hallsworth (substitute:Mr. G. H. Bagnall) the United Kingdom Workers.Relationship with the United Nations   ,23. As its first task the Committee considered the text of a draft Agreementbetween the United Nations and the International Labour Organisation. this draft Agreement which was the first to. be drawn up between the United nations and any specialised agency, was the result of negotiations which took place in new York on 28th and 29th May, 1946, between the Committee on Negotiations
with Specialised Agencies of the Economic and Social Council and the negotiating Delegation of the International Labour Organisation. Mr. Myrddin-Evans acted as Chairman of the Negotiating Delegation and signed the draft agreement on behalf of the Organisation. Sir John Forbes Watson andSir Joseph Hallsworth also served as members of the Negotiating Delegation.24. Under Article I of the draft Agreement the United Nations &quot; recognise the International Labour Organisation as a specialised agency responsible for taking such action as may be appropriate under its basic instrument for theaccomplishment of the purposes set forth therein.&quot; The succeeding articlesdeal with the various matters arising out of the establishment of relationsbetween the United Nations and the International Labour Organisation including, for example, such questions as reciprocal representation at meetingsof the two Organisations, exchange of documents and information, mutual assistance, matters relating to personnel, budgetary matters and aim at sercuring the fullest collaboration between4 the Organisations.The final Article Article XX provides that the Agreement &quot; shall comeinto force on its approval by the General Assembly of the United Nations-and the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation.&quot;25. The Committee unanimously agreed to recommend the Conference to approve the draft Agreement, at the same time expressing &quot; its satisfactionwith the terms of the Draft Agreement, which.it believes fulfils the desiderataset forth in the Resolution concerning the relationship between the Inter-national Labour Organisation and the United Nations adopted at the ParisSession of the Conference.&quot; The Committee report was adopted unanimouslyby the Conference.The Constitution and constitutional practice of the Organisation26. The Committee, as its second task, considered and submitted to theConference its recommendations on the proposals contained in the reports ofthe Conference Delegation on Constitutional Questions.   This Delegation wasappointed by the 27th Session of the International Labour Conference with a comprehensive mandate to review all outstanding questions relating to theConstitution and constitutional practice of the International Labour Organisa-tion.  Mr. Myrddin-Evans acted as Chairman of the Delegation and Sir JohnForbes Watson and Sir Joseph Hallsworth Were members.   The Delegationheld: two sessions. At its first session (held in London from 21st January, 1945to 15th February, 1945) the Delegation adopted a comprehensive report on thequestions referred to it including in its recommendations proposals for very substantially amending the Constitution of the Organisation ; at its second session (held in Montreal on 13th May and in New York on 30th May) it gavespecial consideration, with the assistance of representatives of the federal states which are Members of the Organisation, to the problems which arise in connectionwith the application by federal States of the Conventions and Recommenda-tions adopted by the International Labour Conference, and if made certain proposals for re-defining in the Constitution the obligations of federal States inregard to these matters.   The proposals of the Delegation proved almost completely acceptable to the Constitutional Committee of the Conference.The Committee in its Report to the Conference paid tribute to the patientpreparatory work performed by the Delegation and the spirit of compromise which inspired its proposals.   It added that in all essential matters therecommendations of the Committee were based on the proposals of the delegation.27. The large number of amendments to the Constitution recommended bythe Committee were embodied in a draft Instrument of Amendment which was
10 Msubsequently approved by the Conference, and the text of which is reproduced in full in Appendix III. Of the proposed amendments it is only possible hereto draw attention to so the of the more important.28. The Declaration of Philadelphia. The Committee recommended that article I of the Constitution, which defines the purpose of the InternationalLabour Organisation should be amended to include within that purpose the promotion of the objects set out in the Declaration of Philadelphia. Itfurther recommended that the text of the Declaration of Philadelphia shouldbe annexed to the Constitution.29. Dissolution of the League of Nations. The. Committee recommendedanumber of amendments consequential upon the dissolution of the Leagueof Nations, these being complementary to the amendments to the Articles ofthe Constitution dealing with membership, finance and the procedure for futureamendments which were approved by the Conference at its Paris Session.30. Co-operation with the United Nations. The Committee recommended the adoption Of five amendments designed to facilitate co-operation betweenthe International Labour Organisation and the United Nations. Of these themost important was a general provision that &quot; the International LabourOrganisation shall co-operate within the terms of this Constitution with anygeneral international organisation entrusted with the co-ordination of theactivities of public international organisations having specialised responsibilities and with public international organisations having specialised responsibilities in related fields.&quot;Si. Position of the Governing Body. The Conference Delegation had expressed the view that the existing Constitution did not give . sufficientrecognition to the established position of the Governing Body. The committee agreed with this view and recommended a number of amendments designedto clarify the existing constitutional position.32. Implementation of Conventions and Recommendations. We desire todraw particular attention to this matter, for the International LabourOrganisation has been widely criticised in recent years on the groundthat, although many Conventions have been passed, a substantial numberof those Conventions have been ratified by a relatively small numberof States. Ratification is not necessarily a true guide to the extent to which the standards laid down in a Convention are being applied in a particular State,but, when allowance has been made for this, doubt has still remained regardingthe extent to which the provisions of Conventions were being applied generally,by members of the Organisation. The Conference Delegation devoted mjichtime to a consideration of this problem and recommended important amend-ments to Article 19 of the Constitution, designed to secure an improvement in the implementation of the provisions of both Conventions and Recommendations.These proposed amendments, which were accepted by the Committee andsubsequently by the Conference, include the introduction of- three newobligations providing: ,(i) that Members of the Organisation shall inform the Director-General of,    .    the measures taken in accordance with the article to bring conventions and Recommendations before the competent authority or authorities,with particulars of the authority or authorities regarded as competentand of the action taken by them ;(ii) that if a Convention fails to obtain the consent of the competent authority or authorities the Member &quot; shall report to the Director-General of theInternational Labour Office, at appropriate intervals as requested by
25w the Governing Body, the position of its law and practice in regard to thematters dealt with in the Convention and showing the extent to which effect has been given or is proposed to be given to any of the provisionsof the Convention by legislation, administrative action, collective agreement of otherwise and stating the difficulties which prevent or delay the ratification of such Convention &quot; ; and(iii) that, in the case of a Recommendation, Members &quot;will report to theDirector-General of the Intejmational Labour Office, at appropriateintervals as requested by the Governing Body, the position of the lawand practice in their country in regard to the matters dealt with in theRecommendation and showing the extent to which effect has been given or is proposed to be given to the provisions of the recommendations and such modifications of these provisions as have been found or maybe found necessary to make in adopting or applying them.&quot;33. Federal States. The Committee also recommended an amendmentdesigned to clarify and in certain respects to strengthen the obligations of federal States under Article 19 of the Constitution.34. Non-self-governing territories. The Committee recommended that article 3 of the Constitution should be amended by the inclusion of a newparagraph. The effect of this would be to enable each Member responsiblefor the international relations of non-metropolitan territories to appoint, as additional advisers to each of its delegates, persons nominated by it as representatives of any such territory in regard to matters within the self-governing powers of that territory. It would also enable such a Member toappoint additional advisers, not having the status of representatives, to* adviseeach of its delegates in regard to matters concerning non-self-governing terri-tories. It also recommended amendments to Article 35 of the Constitutionof the Organisation designed to improve the procedure for the application ofConventions to non-metropolitan territories, especially where the subject matterof a Convention is within the self-governing powers of the territory.135. Legal status and immunities of the organisation. The Committee re-commended the inclusion in the Constitution of two new articles dealingwith the legal status and immunities of the Organisation. The first of these articles provides that &quot; The International Labour Organisation shall possess fulljuridical personality and in particular the capacity (a) to contract ; (b) toacquire and dispose of movable and immovable property; (c) to institutelegal proceedings.&quot; The second article provides that &quot; The InternationalLabour Organisation shall enjoy in the territory of each of its Members suchprivileges and immunities as are necessary for the fulfilment of its purposes,&quot;that &quot;delegates to the Conference, members of the Governing Body, and theDirector-General and officials of the Office shall likewise enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organisation,&quot; and that &quot; such privileges and immunitiesshall be defined in a separate agreement to be prepared by the Organisation andconcluded between the Members.&quot;   (See also paragraph 43.)36. Representation on the Governing Body. The Conference Delegation had proposed^ on the initiative of its non-European members, the abrogation ofthose provisions in Article 7 of the Constitution which reserve a certain numberof places on the Governing Body for non-European Governments, Employersand Workers. The Delegation were influenced in making this recommendation by the fact that the Governing Body now includes a larger number of non-European representatives than these constitutional provisions require. Thesuggestion was opposed by the non-European States while, on the other hand,
proposals were made for an increase in the number of seats to be reserved for &apos;non-European representatives. After considerable discussion it was decided toleave the present text unchanged, at the same time drawing the special attentionof the Conference to the following passage from the first report of the Con-ference Delegation :&quot;In order that the International Labour Organisation may continue to operate efficiently, it requires a strong Governing Body which continues to enjoy the full confidence of the Members of the Organisation. two important conditions must be fulfilled if this confidence is to be fully main-tained under present-day conditions. No important region of the worldmust be left without appropriate representation on the Governing Body,but, on the other hand, regional understandings in regard to the distributionof seats must not operate in such a manner as to deprive of the chance of representation on the Governing Body from time to time States whichcollaborate effectively with the International Labour Organisation and give it consistent financial support but which do not fall conveniently into anyregional group. . . . Since the expenditure of the Organisation is governedprimarily by Governing Body decisions iVis only reasonable to regard thefact of being in arrears in the payment of contributions as a disqualificationfor membership of the Governing Body.&quot;37. Representation at the Conference. The Committee had a long debate on an amendment submitted by the French Government representative whichwould have the effect of changing the basis of representation at the Con-ference. Under the existing provisions of the Constitution each Member is represented at the Conference by two Government delegates, one delegaterepresenting employers and one delegate representing workers. The FrenchGovernment amendment provided that the Conference should consist of.six representatives of each Member, of whom two should be government delegates, two should represent the employers and two should representthe workers, and that one of the employers&apos; representatives shouldbe chosen from among the managers of undertakings possessed or controlled by public organisations where such organisations exist. A comple-mentary amendment provided that each of the sixteen governments represented on the Governing Body should have one vote and that each of the eight employers&apos; representatives and each of the eight workers&apos; representatives should have two votes. The amendment was supported by the representativeof the Polish Government, by the French and Italian Workers&apos; representatives,and by a number of the representatives of the Latin-American workers, who supported it in substitution for the proposal they themselves had made inParis in 1945 that there should be two Government delegates, of whom one &quot;would represent nationalised undertakings, two Workers&apos; delegates and oneEmployers&apos; delegate. An alternative amendment proposed by the CubanGovernment representative provided for three Government delegates, twoEmployers&apos; delegates and two Workers&apos; delegates.38. This question was the only one of those considered by the ConferenceDelegation on which it had failed to reach a completely unanimous conclusion,ten of the twelve Members of the Delegation being opposed to the FrenchGovernmenfs proposal and one (M. Leon Jouhaux, the French Worker delegate)being absent from the discussion. The&apos;detailed arguments for and against theproposal are set out in the Delegation^ first report and the United KingdomGovernment, Employers&apos; and Workers&apos; delegates all- opposed the amendmentfor the reasons set out therein. In view of the weight of opinion in theCommittee which was clearly very much opposed to the proposal and in viewof the desire which had been expressed by some Members to avoid a division
on the subject; the representatives of the, French and Cuban Governmentsagreed to withdraw their amendments, it being understood that the matter could be raised again in the future at any appropriate time. The agreement reached by the Committee on this basis was facilitated by the unanimousdesire of the Committee to make it clear that the International LabourOrganisation desires, and will welcome the active participation in the Organisa-tion of all the Members of the United Nations.Other questions arising out of the first report of the Conference Delegation39. In addition to the proposal of the Delegation for the amendment of theConstitution of the International Labour Organisation, the first report of theConference Delegation contained certain other - proposals which fell to beconsidered by the Committee. The more important of these are described in the succeeding paragraphs.40. The Conference Delegation put forward the draft of a Convention for the revision of the final articles of the existing International Labour Conventionsfor the purpose of making provision for the future discharge of the chanceryfunctions entrusted by these Conventions to the Secretary-General of theLeague of Nations. This was consequential upon the dissolution of the Leagueof Nations and the amendment of the Constitution of the International LabourOrganisation. With certain minor amendments in the text approved by theConference Delegation, the Committee recommended the Conference to adoptthe Convention.41. The Conference Delegation also submitted a draft of certain final articlesconcerning ratification and denunciation procedure to be inserted in future international Labour Conventions. This proposal also was consequential uponthe dissolution of the League of Nations and the amendment of the Constitutionof the Organisation, and the Committee recommended its adoption.42. The Committee attached special importance to a model clause, proposedby the Conference Delegation, concerning measures to secure compliance withthe provisions of Conventions which the Conference Delegation had suggested should be included in future Conventions in appropriate cases. This clauseprovided that the laws and regulations giving effect to the provisions of theConvention should (a) require the competent authority to bring them to thenotice of all persons concerned ; (b) define the persons responsible for com-compliance therewith ; (c) prescribe adequate penalties for any violation thereof ;and (d) provide for the maintenance of a system of inspection adequate to ensureeffective enforcement. It also provided that the annual reports submitted byMembers of the Organisation under Article 22 of the Constitution should containfull information concerning such laws and regulations and a general survey ofthe results of the inspections made in accordance therewith. The committee recommended the Conference to approve the clause.Privileges and immunities43. The Committee submitted to the Conference the draft of a convention on the privileges and immunities of the International Labour Organisation(see also paragraph 35) with the recommendation that the Conference should refer the Convention to the Governing Body for fuller consideration in the lightof further negotiation and consultation with the United Nations and otheragencies with a view to a revised draft Agreement being submitted to the 1947Session of the Conference. The text of a Resolution on the subject for adoption by the Conference was proposed by the Committee.
Desirability of prompt ratification of the Instrument of Amendment, 194644. The Committee considered it desirable that the Conference should draw the attention of Governments to the desirability of prompt ratification of theConstitution of the International Labour Organisation Instrument of amendment, 1946, and the Final Articles.Revision Convention, 1946, and&apos;recommended to the Conference the adoption of a Resolution focussing attentionon the matter.Provisional arrangements. 45. The Committee made proposals to the Conference regarding threematters in respect of which it seemed desirable to make provisional arrange-ments to cover the period prior to the coming into force of the Instrument of amendment, 1946.   It proposed that :(a) the Conference should extend until the entry into force of the Instrumentthe authority given to the Governing Body to decide the place of furthermeetings of the Conference ;(6) the Director of the International Labour Office should be known forth-with as the Director-General of the International Labour Office ; and(c) the Director-General should assume forthwith the functions in connectionwith the communication to Members of. the Organisation of certifiedcopies of Conventions and Recommendations and in connection with the registration of ratifications of Conventions entrusted to him by the amended text qf Article 19 of the Constitution of the Organisation.Proposals adopted46. Certain amendments to the recommendations of the Committee were moved in Plenary Session. These were rejected and the report and recommenda-tions finally adopted.47. After formal revision by the Drafting Committee, the texts of - the&quot; Instrument for the Amendment of the Constitution of the InternationalLabour Organisation &quot; and the &quot; Convention for partial revision of conventions adopted by the general Conference at its first twenty-eight Sessions &quot; were put to a final record vote. The former was adopted by 124 votes to 0, the latterby 123 votes to 0. In each case the four United Kingdom delegates voted for adoption.PROTECTION OF CHILDREN AND YOUNG WORKERS(ITEM III OF THE AGENDA)48. On this Committee, H.M. Government were represented by Mr. C. G.Dennys (substitutes : Miss F. I. Taylor, Mr. L. N. Blake Odgers, Mr. R. R.Bowman). The United Kingdom Employers were represented by Sir JohnForbes Watson (substitutes: Brigadier-General A. C. Baylay, Mr. W. Scholes,Mr. A. H. Mathias), and the United Kingdom Workers by Miss FlorenceHancock and Mr. A. Roberts. The Committee elected the following officers :Chairman, Dr. Alvarado (Peruvian Government delegate) ; Vice-Chairmen,Mr. L. E. Cornil (Belgian Employers&apos; delegate) ; Miss Florence Hancock (UnitedKingdom Workers&apos; adviser).Medical examination for fitness for employment (young workers)49. The Committee first proceeded to a discussion of the question of medical examination for fitness for employment (young workers) taking as a basis threetexts prepared by the International Labour Office (i) a proposed Conventionapplicable to industry ; (ii) a proposed Convention applicable to non-industrial occupations; and (iii) a supplementary Recommendation containing suggestions-on the methods of application of both Conventions.
-     2750, The two proposed Conventions both dealt with the same subjects-medical examination before engagement; repetition of medical examinationup to 18 years of age ; extension of these examinations up to 21 in case of workparticularly dangerous to health; vocational guidance and physical andvocational rehabilitation of young workers or children: found to be unfit ormerely unsuited for employment; and finally special provisions for certain countries. Each of the original texts provided a power of exemption of familyundertakings where the work is not dangerous to the health of children or youngpersons, but the Committee adopted a proposal for the removal of this provisionfrom the industrial Convention.51. In the case of the proposed Convention applicable to non-industrial occupations, the view was expressed by certain members of the Committee thatit would be preferable to adopt a Recommendation on this subject and an amendment to that effect was moved by Mr. Cornil in the name of theEmployers&apos; Group when the Report of the Committee was debated in thePlenary Session! This amendment was rejected and the Conference adoptedthis Convention in the form proposed by the Committee. The Conferencesimilarly approved the proposed Convention applicable to industrial occupations and the proposed Recommendation.52. After formal revision by the Drafting Committee the three texts were put to a final record vote. The text of the Convention concerning medical examina-tion for fitness for employment in industry of children and young persons wasadopted by 123 votes to 0. The four United Kingdom delegates voted for its adoption, .

The United Kingdom government delegates and the United Kingdom Workers&apos; delegate voted for its adoption,the United Kingdom Employers&apos; delegate voted against. The text of theRecommendation concerning the medical examination for fitness for employ-ment of children and young persons was adopted by 119 votes to 0. The fourUnited Kingdom delegates voted for its adoption.Restriction&apos; of night work of children and young persons in non-industrialoccupations53. The Committee subsequently proceeded to a discussion of the question ofthe restriction of night work of children and young persons in non-industrial occupations using as a basis draft texts, prepared by the International LabourOffice, of a proposed Convention and of a proposed Recommendation.54. The proposed Convention provided powers of exemption for work in domestic service and in family undertakings where the Work is not dangerous to the health of young persons. It dealt with the age groups to be covered byand the span of hours which should constitute the rest period, providing for children under 14, and those of 14 years and over who are subject to compulsoryschool attendance, a rest period of at least 14 consecutive hours, including the interval between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m., and for children over 14 not subject to compulsory school attendance, and young persons under 18, a 12-hour restperiod, including the interval between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. The proposed convention provided special safeguards where exceptional circumstancesprevailed. , .. &apos;55. The proposed Recommendation on restriction of night work includedpoints relating to the practical application of the proposed Convention.56. When the Report of the Committee, containing the proposed texts was put before the Conference, one amendment was proposed to the text of the draft
Convention. This related to a proposal adopted by the Committee for a powerof exemption of young persons of 16 years of age and over when essential reasonsso require. The amendment proposed to limit this to a power to grant temporaryindividual licences of exemption when essential reasons of vocational trainingso require. The amendment was submitted by the Government delegates ofBelgium, France and the Netherlands and was carried on a record vote by81 votes to 27. The four United Kingdom delegates voted for the amendment.The proposed Recommendation was adopted without objection.57. After formal revision by the Drafting Committee the texts of the Con-vention and the Recommendation concerning restriction of night work ofchildren and young workers in non-industrial occupations were put to a finalrecord vote. -The Convention was adopted by 111 votes to 0, the Recommenda-tion by 123 votes to 0. In both cases the four United Kingdom delegatesvoted for adoption.Medical examination for fitness for employment of children and young personsemployed in agriculture58. The Committee also proposed to the Conference the adoption of aResolution earnestly requesting &quot; the Governing Body to consider the possibilityof instructing the Permanent. Agricultural Committee to study with the least possible delay the question of extending medical examination for fitness for employment to children and young persons under 18 years of age employed inagriculture or in the raising of livestock so that this question may, at theconclusion of the study, be placed on the agenda of the International LabourConference as the Conference proposed last year.&quot; The Conference adopted theRecommendation without opposition.MINIMUM STANDARDS OF SOCIAL POLICY IN dependent territories (PROVISIONS SUITABLE FOR A CONVENTION)(FIRST DISCUSSION)(ITEM IV ON THE AGENDA)59.

In each case the Committee stated the provisions to be taken intoaccount by the International Labour Office in preparing the drafts of theseConventions.
2862. On a final record vote the Conference decided by 94 votes to 2 to place onthe Agenda of its next session the subjects mentioned in the previous paragraphwith a view to a final decision on a Convention or Conventions. The UnitedKingdom Government delegates and the United Kingdom Workers&apos; delegatevoted for the Resolution, the United Kingdom Employers&apos; delegate abstained.63. -As a corollary to the proposals for the above Conventions, the Conferenceadopted a Resolution concerning freedom of labour, drawing attention to the urgent importance of general ratification and application by the Statesresponsible for non-self-governing territories, and by other States where theconditions covered by the Conventions may occur, of the Forced Labour Con-vention, 1930, the Recruiting of Indigenous Workers Convention, 1936, the contracts of Employment (Indigenous Workers) Convention, 1939, and the penal Sanctions (Indigenous Workers) Convention, 1939.64.

Reference was made in the Committee&apos;s Report to the far-reachingproposals made by the Conference Delegation on Constitutional Questions forthe amendment of Articles 19 and 22 of the Constitution and for the inclusionof a new Article 23. The Committee assumed that it would have made availableto it the reports to be submitted by States Members under these additionalprovisions. On this question, and in other connections, the Committee also made certain observations regarding the work of the Committee of Expertsset up under Article 22 of the Constitution.70. The Committee made a number of detailed suggestions with the objectof ensuring that -it would be able at the 1947 Conference to have available the necessary information to enable it to resume the former practice of carryingout a thorough-going examination of the Annual Reports. In this connection the Committee stressed the need for all Governments to submit their reports to time.71. The Report of the Committee was adopted by the Conference without opposition. :-fFINANCIAL AND BUDGETARY MATTERS72. In accordance with the terms of the Instrument of Amendment of theConstitution, adopted by the Conference at its 27th Session, it was necessaryfor the Conference to provide machinery under which the budgetary andfinancial operations should be conducted, pending the conclusion of financialand budgetary arrangements with the United Nations, as contemplated in thatInstrument. The Governing Body submitted to the Conference draft amendedFinancial Regulations covering (i) drawing up the budget; (ii) adoption of thebudget; (iii) collection of funds ; (iv) appropriation of funds ; (v) working capital fund ; (vi) reserve fund ; (vii) investment of funds ; (viii) accounts ;(ix) internal control and (x) external supervision.73. On the recommendation of the Selection Committee, the Conferenceadopted provisionally the proposed amended Financial Regulations, it being understood that they would be referred to the Governing Body for furtherconsideration during the interval preceding the next session of the Conference.74. As an essential part of the procedure for the adoption of the AnnualBudget the proposed Financial Regulations included a provision for theestablishment by the Conference of a Committee consisting of one government representative of each State Member of the Organisation represented at theConference, to which the Conference should refer for examination and reportthe budget estimates submitted by the Director of the Office. On the recom-mendation of the Selection Committee the Conference&apos; appointed such aCommittee, with the title &quot; Finance Committee of Government Representa-tives.&quot;Finance Committee of Government representatives75. The United Kingdom Government were represented on this committee by Mr. G. Myrddin-Evans (substitutes: Mr. C. G. Dennys,. Mr. W. B.Bradshaw). The Committee appointed, as its Chairman, Mr. William Rappard
*(Swiss Government delegate) and, as its Reporter, Mr. W. Laves (United StatesGovernment adviser). The Governing Body were represented at meetings of theCommittee by a tripartite delegation, consisting of Mr. G. Myrddin-Evans(Chairman), Mr. J. D. Zellerbach (Employers&apos; Vice-Chairman) and Mr. L.Jouhaux (Workers&apos; Vice-Chairman).76. Budget of the Organisation. The Finance Committee proposed to theConference for the financial year 1.947, the adoption of a budget of net expendi-ture amounting to 15,952,980 Swiss francs (gold francs, 11,290,141) and abudget of income amounting to the same. Under this budget the net contribu-tion payable by the United Kingdom for 194.7 will be 1,579,319 gold francs,roughly equivalent to  129,000. In 1946, the net expenditure budget was11,521,510 Swiss francs (gold francs 8,149,239) and the net contributionpayable by the United Kingdom was 1,412,709 gold francs. In addition, a contribution of 100,000 Swiss francs (gold francs 70,731) was made to thePensions Fund of the League of Nations, representing the share in respect ofthe International Labour Office, making a total payment of 2,097,308 Swissfrancs, roughly equivalent to  121,000.77. Contributions of Member States. The Committee took note of certain proposals put forward by the Governing Body relating to the determination of the number of units of contribution for which States Members of theOrganisation should be assessed for the financial year, 1947. To assist it in its consideration of this matter, the Governing Body had appointed an AllocationsCommittee, consisting of Government representatives,; to consider the wholequestion of contributions. The Allocations Committee had recommended thata practical way to deal with the immediate problem was to seek to increasethe total number of units of contribution by negotiating with the government representatives of those States which since 1938 had been accorded a reductionin the number of units of contribution for which they had been assessed, as toany increases on the existing assessment to which they would be prepared toagree for the 1947 budget. The Governing Body had entrusted these negotia-tions to the Allocations Committee and in the result certain countries felt ableto increase their contributions for 1947. The Finance Committee of Govern-ment Representatives expressed its warm appreciation to the countries concerned. Under these arrangements the total number of units of contribution for 1947 will be 690 of which the United Kingdom share- will be 108 units(15-7 per cent.). In 1946, the United Kingdom share, excluding the Pensionscontribution, was 108 units out of a total of 623 units (17-3 per cent.).78. Conditions of employment of staff. The Finance Committee was informed of the present state of the consideration by the Governing Body ofthe conditions of employment of the staff of the International Labour Office.The Committee noted that the Governing Body had set up a Committee of experts with the following terms of reference :To review the conditions of employment, including in particular the salaryscales, and the job classifications of the staff of the International LabourOffice and to make recommendations to the Staff Questions committee regarding such changes as seem appropriate in the light of the needs ofthe International Labour Organisation and in pursuance of the draft agreement dated 30th May, 1946, between the International &quot;LabourOrganisation and the United Nations.The Committee agreed to recommend that, without prejudice to the powers ofthe Conference, the Governing Body should be authorised to determine new orrevised salary scales in 1947 after considering the recommendations of theStaff Questions Committee on the report of the Committee of Experts.   Inthe meantime the Finance Committee noted the decision of the Governing
Body to provide a measure of immediate alleviation to the staff by refunding the voluntary Contributions paid by the staff since 1st January, 1946, andinforming them that no further Voluntary Contribution was expected from them. The Finance Committee also approved the abolition as from 1st September, 1946, of the 10 per cent, reduction made on salary scales in 1932.79. Staff Pensions Fund. The Governing Body proposed to the conference the adoption of certain amendments to the Staff Pensions Regulations madenecessary by the transfer of the Staff Pensions Fund to the InternationalLabour Organisation. The Committee recommended to the Conference thatthese amendments should be provisionally adopted pending further con-sideration by the next Session of the Conference. In addition, the committee recommended to the Conference the adoption of a resolution submitted to it by the Governing Body fixing the rates of contribution payable to the PensionsFund in 1947.80. Administrative Tribunal. The Governing Body had submitted to theConference two draft resolutions, one for the purpose of giving effect tothe Governing Body&apos;s decision to assume responsibility for maintaining theAdministrative Tribunal, and the other confirming the terms of office of the judges of the Administrative Tribunal. The Finance Committee of Govern-ment representatives recommended to the Conference that the amendments to the Statute of the Administrative Tribunal proposed by the GoverningBodyshould be provisionally adopted pending further consideration by the next session of the Conference. As regards the Judges, the Committee recommended the Conference to confirm for a further period of three years the terms of officeof the Judges and Deputy Judges of the Tribunal who were in Office on the1st January, 1940, and whose terms of office had been prolonged until 1st April, 1947.Adoption by the Conference.81. The Conference adopted without opposition the Committee&apos;s Report.The draft Resolution put forward by the Committee concerning the adoptionof the budget for 1947 and the allocation of expenses among States members for 1947 was the subject of a record vote. It was adopted by 130 votes to 0.The four United Kingdom delegates voted for adoption,COMMITTEE ON STANDING ORDERS82. H.M. Government were not represented on this Committee. TheUnited Kingdom Employers were represented by Sir John Forbes Watson(substitutes : Brigadier-General A. C. Baylay, Mr. R. Hewitt) and the UnitedKingdom Workers by Mr. H. L. Bullock. The Committee appointed as itsChairman, Mr. J. J. Hearne (Government delegate, Eire) and as its Vice-Chairmen, Mr. C. Kuntschen (Swiss Employers&apos; delegate) and Mr. Bullock83. The Committee had to consider proposals concerning the Standing orders of the Conference submitted by the Governing Body of the International LabourOffice. These were in the form of proposed amendments to the Standing Orders,designed to give effect to a Resolution, adopted by the .27th Session of theInternational Labour Conference, that provision should be made (a) for officialtranslations into Spanish of speeches and remarks made in other languages,as well as official translations into other languages of speeches and remarksmade in Spanish, to be furnished by the Secretariat of the Conference ; and(6) for all documents of the Conference as well as the stenographic record of theproceedings to be published in Spanish in the same way as in English andFrench.

Watt (United States Workers&apos; delegate)and the Indian Delegation proposed an amended Resolution &quot; which,&quot; Mr. Wattsaid, &quot; both the Indian delegates and I believe more fully expresses and moreaffirmatively achieves the high purposes which are outlined in the text of theoriginal Resolution.&quot; The amended Resolution was adopted, on a show ofhands, by 88 votes to 0. ;DISCUSSION ON THE DIRECTORS REPORT(ITEM I OF THE AGENDA)87. The discussion of the Director&apos;s Report occupied several plenary sittings of the Conference.  Sixty-six speakers from 34 countries took part.88. The Report contained a general study of the world economic positionand described the activities of the International Labour Organisation over thepast year. A section of the Report was devoted to a discussion of theorganisation of employment to give the Conference an opportunity to discuss this problem.89. The Rt. Hon. George A. Isaacs, Minister of Labour and NationalService, took part in the discussion of the Report. He referred to the period since he last addressed the Conference saying :&quot; The year which has passed since the Paris Conference has been oneof great activity internationally and nationally. Last year I brought tothe Conference from the British Labour Government a message of loyalty to the International Labour Organisation and of faith in its destiny.Today, I renew&apos;that message and add that, as every day passes, we inGreat Britain and I am satisfied that here I speak for all parties in theState and for all classes&quot; of the people are more than ever convinced in face of the difficulties and perplexities of this modern, restless, suspiciousand fearful post-war world, of the need for the International LabourOrganisation and of the duty of supporting the ideas and developing thespirit of co-operation which it embodies.&quot;90. The Minister spoke of the two innovations in International LabourOrganisation practice introduced at the Seattle Conference first, the intro-duction into an international instrument, for the first time, of an internationalminimum wage, and second, the provision recognising collective agreements
as acceptable instruments for putting into, effect the terms of a Convention.He went on:&quot; The British Government supported both these proposals, but in regardto the international minimum wage, while we view this niatter with theutmost sympathy, there is one point which I must make quite clear. Wedo not in&apos; any way recede from our view that actual national standards,as opposed to an international minimum, are best decided by means of voluntary agreements between representative organisations of employersand workers. With regard to the question of putting the provisions ofConventions, into operation by means of collective agreements, the BritishGovernment recognises that it may frequently happen that a Memberwhose conditions are equivalent to or even better than the provisions of aCovention may, for some technical, or other reason, be unable to undertakeformal ratification of the Convention, and so may give the impression thatit is not faithfully carrying out its obligations under the Convention.We, accordingly, have much sympathy with the motive underlying thisproposal and will watch the experiment with great interest; but we mustinsist that it should be regarded as an experiment only, and be open to review in the light of experience. In the view of the British Government,it is of the utmost importance to this Organisation, and to those whom itexists to serve, that nothing must be done which would, in the slightestdegree, weaken the sense of responsibility of Members for carrying out theobligations which they undertake by their membership and by theirvote in Conference.&quot;91. Mr. Isaacs also referred to the conclusion of the draft Agreement bringing the International Labour Organisation into relationship with the united nations.&quot; The British Government,&quot; he said, &quot; has never wavered in its belief that such a relationship is essential to both organisations. The Inter-national Labour Organisation defined at Versailles in 1919, and restatedat Philadelphia in 1944, principles which later were incorporated in the charter of the United Nations. But there is here no question of rivalry.The two organisations have common ideals and common objectives andfor the attainment of those objectives each is essential to the other. At theSan Francisco Conference, and ever since, the British Government have pressed for the establishment of a real partnership between the united nations and the International Labour Organisation, believing that onlyin such a relationship can their common ideals be achieved. It is therefore a matter of the utmost gratification to the British Government that adraft Agreement has been concluded, which, when it is accepted, as I feel- confident it will be accepted by this Conference and by the United Nations,will constitute a substantial advance along the path of international collaboration which must be followed everywhere and in all spheres if thisworld is to be made safe for our children and for our childfen&apos;s children.The Governing Body are entitled to your warm commendation for their efforts. We rejoice at the spirit in which the negotiations were conducted by both parties.&quot;92. In his reply to the discussion on his Report; the Director (Mr. E. J.Phelan) said that there seemed to be general recognition that international action was necessary to deal with aU the strains and stresses resulting fromthe war. There was international machinery now in existence to meet the World&apos;sneeds which, he declared, were peace, production and social justice. But itwas necessary to be clear what the instruments at our disposal could or could
not do. He referred to the International Labour Organisation^ lively interestin all new economic and social experiments, and to the necessity for payinggreater attention to affairs in Latin-America, Asia and the Middle East.RELATIONS WITH OTHER ORGANISATIONS93. The following official organisations were represented at the Conference :the United Nations, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administra-tion, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation,the Inter-Governmental Committee on Refugees and the Provisional Inter-national Civil Aviation Organisation.94. At the commencement of the Conference, Mr. Jan Stanczyk, Director-General, the Department of Social Affairs of the United Nations, greeted theConference on behalf of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and Mr. H.Laugier, Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations spoke during the closing speeches.95. In the course of the session the Secretary-General of the United Nations(Mr. Trygve Lie) also addressed the Conference. He said that the united nations did not possess the machinery to perform all the objectives laid down for it in the economic and social field and that it would have to depend to agreat extent upon other bodies. In the case of the International LabourOrganisation, he continued, the United Nations looks to an Organisation ofproved efficiency, in which employers and workers as well as governments are represented, to carry out one of the most important branches of this work.The successful experience of the International Labour Organisation was themost important single factor in developing the new idea of specialised agencies.That.experience proved the value of separate organisations, with a large measureof autonomy, operating as instruments of international-co-operation in theirspecific fields. The Secretary-General then referred in detail to the draft Agree-ment between the United Nations and the International Labour Organisation,stressing the importance of ensuring that the work of the two organisationsshould be properly integrated and giving it as his &quot; personal assurance that ifthe International Labour Organisation decides to make its permanent head-quarters at the site of the United Nations, the United Nations secretariat will do everything possible to assist you in securing the accommodations you need.&apos;&apos;REPRESENTATIVES OF NON-MEMBER STATES96.

But, holding as they do that labour should not be regarded merely asan article of commerce, they think thatthere are methods and principles for regulating labour conditions which allindustrial communities should endeavourto apply, so far as their special circum-stances will permit.Among these methods and principles,the following seem to the High ContractingParties to be of special and urgentimportance :
3. Le Comite international cTorganisa-tion sera compose&quot; de sept personnes-ddsignees respectivement par les gouverne-ments des Etats-Unis, de la Grande-Bretagne, de la France, de ITtalie, duJapon, de la Belgique et de la Suisse.Le Comite pourra, s&apos;il le juge ndcessaire,inviter d&apos;autres Membres a se faire repre-senter dans son sein.4. L&apos;ordre du jour sera le suivant:1&quot; Application du principe de la journdede 8 heures ou de&apos; la semaine de 48 heures.2&quot; Questions relatives aux moyens depreVenir le chomage et de remedier a sesconsequences.3&quot; Emploi des femmes :(a) avant ou apres 1&apos;accouchement(y compris la question de 1&apos;indemnite dematernite) ;(6) pendant la nuit;(c) dans les travaux insalubres.4&quot; Emploi des enfants :(a) age d&apos;admission au travail;(6) travaux de nuit;(c) travaux insalubres.S0 Extension et application des conven-tions.internationales adoptees a Berne en1906 sur 1&apos;interdiction du travail de nuitdes femmes employees dans 1&apos;industrie et1&apos;interdiction de 1&apos;emploi du phosphoreblanc (jaune) dans 1&apos;industrie des allu-mettes.SECTION IIPRINCIPES GENERA UXArticle 41Les Hautes Parties Contractantes,reconnaissant que le bien-etre physique,moral et intellectuel des travailleurssalaries est d&apos;une importance essentielle aupoint de vue international, ont etabli, pourparvenir a ce but eieve, 1&apos;organisme per-manent prevu a la section i et associe acelui de la Societe des Nations.Elles reconnaissent que les differences declimat, de moeurs et d&apos;usages, d&apos;oppor-tunite economique et de tradition indus-triclle rendent difficile a atteindre, d&apos;unemaniere immediate, 1&apos;uniformite absoluedans les conditions du travail. Mais,persuadees qu&apos;elles sont que le travail nedoit pas etre consider simplement commeuh article de commerce, elles pensent qu&apos;il &apos;y a des methodes et des principes pour lareglementation des conditions du travailque toutes les communautes industriellesdevraient s&apos;s&apos;efforcer d&apos;appliquer, autantque les circonstances speciales danslesquelles elles pourraient se trouver lepermettraient. -Parmi ces methodes et principes, lessuivants paraissent aux Hautes parties contractantes etre d&apos;une importancepartieulifere et urgente :
First. The guiding principle aboveenunciated that labour should not beregarded merely as a commodity or article of commerce.Second. The right of association for alllawful purposes by the employed as wellas by the employers.Third. The payment to the employedof a wage adequate to maintain a reason-able standard of life as this is understoodin their time and country.Fourth.-Ttie adoption of an eight hoursday or a forty-eight hours week as thestandard to be aimed at where it has not already been attained.Fifth. The adoption of a weekly restof at least twenty-four hours, which should include Sunday wherever practicable.Sixth. The abolition of child labour andthe imposition of such limitations on thelabour of young persons as shall permit the&apos;continuation of their education and assuretheir proper physical development.Seventh. The principle that men andwomen should receive equal remuneration for work of equal value.Eighth. The standard set by la.w in each country with respect to the conditions oflabour should have due regard to the equitable economic treatment of all workers lawfully resident therein.Ninth. Each State should make provi-sion for a system of inspection in whichwomen should take: part, in order toensure the enforcement of the laws and regulations for the protection of the employed.Without claiming that these methods and principles are either complete or final,the High Contracting Parties are ofopinion that they are well fitted to guide the policy of the League of Nations ; andthat, if adopted by the industrial com-munities who are Members of the League,and safeguarded in practice by an adequatesystem of such inspection, they will conferlasting benefits upon the wage earners ofthe world.The foregoing is the authentic text of the Constitution- of the International LabourOrganisation Instrument of Amendment; 1946, duly adopted by the General Conferenceof the International Labour Organisation on the ninth day of October one thousand nine hundred and forty-six in the course of its Twenty-ninth Session, which was held at montreal.The English and French versions of the text of this Instrument of Amendment apequally authoritative.IN FAITH WHEREOF we have appended our signatures this first day ofNovember 1946.The President of the Conference,HUMPHREY MITCHELL.The Director-General of the International Labour Office,EDWARD PHELAN

*2I. Employment in Public Entertain-ment, 3. Where local authorities are em-powered, in virtue of the provisions ofArticle .5 of the Night Work of YoungPersons (Non-Industrial Occupations) Con-vention, 1946, to grant individual licences to children and young persons allowingthem to appear at night as performers in public entertainments or to participate at night as performers in the making of cine-matographic films, supervisory controlover the issuing of such licences should be vested in a higher authority to which thepersons concerned may appeal eitheragainst the refusal of the licence or against any of the conditions imposed therein.4. Licences should be issued for limitedperiods and should be subject to all theconditions necessary in the circumstancesof each case for the protection of the child or young person.5. Licences should be granted for children under fourteen years of age onlyin exceptional cases in which they are justified by the need of vocational trainingor the talent of the child and should besubject to the following conditions :(a) such licences should be restricted as a rule to children who are attending,institutions for dramatic or musicalinstruction ;(b) employment at night should be limitedas far as possible to three evenings aweek or to an average of three eveningsa week calculated over a longer pefioc&quot;.;(c) employment should cease by tenb&apos;clock in the evening or a rest periodof sixteen consecutive hours shouldbe granted.III. Methods of Supervision6. While respecting % the principle laiddown in paragraph 12 of the LabourInspection Recommendation, 1923, accord-ing to which the inspectorate should includemen and women having the same powersand duties and exercising the sameauthority, it is desirable to take intoaccount the experience of certain countrieswhich have found it particularly satis-factory to entrust to women inspectors the enforcement of laws and regulations forthe protection of young workers.7. In addition to regular inspection toensure compliance with the laws and regulations for the protection of young workers, special attention should be given,in order to achieve effective applicationof the provisions of the Night Work of young Persons (Non-Industrial Occupa-tions) Convention, 1946, as regards non-industrial activities carried on in a great number of small and scattered undertaking -II. Emploi dans les spectaclespublics3. Si, en vertu des dispositions de1&apos;ar.ticle 5 de la convention sur le travailde nuit des adolescents (travaux nonindustriels), 1946, des autorites localessont investies du pouvoir d&apos;accorder deslicences individuelles a des enfants et a des adolescents afin de leur permettre departiciper la nuit en qualite d&apos;acteurs ades prises de yues cin matographiques, ilconviendrait d&apos;attribuer un pouvoir decontrole sur l&apos;octroi des licences a uneautorite superieure a - Iaquelle il pourra etre fait appel par les interesses, soitcontre le refus de la licence, soit contredes conditions qui y sont imposees.4. Les licences devraient etre deiivreespour une periode limitee, sous les con-ditions qui, dans les circonstances par-ticulieres a chaque cas, sont necessaires ala protection de 1&apos;enfant ou de 1&apos;adolescent.5. Les licences devraient etre deiivrees,pour des enfants de moins de quatorze ans,seulement dans des cas exceptionnels,lorsque le besoin de formation profession-nelle de 1&apos;enfant ou son talent precoceTejustifie, et sous les conditions suivantes :(a) ces licences ne devraient etre deiivrees,&apos;en rfegle generale, qu&apos;a des enfantsfaisant des etudes dans un etablisse-ment d&apos;art theatral ou musical;(b) le travail denuit devrait etre limite,dans la mesure du possible, a troissoirees par semaine, ou a une moyennede trois soirees par semaine calcuiee surune periode plus etendue ;       .(c) 1&apos;emploi devrait se terminer a dix heuresdu soir ou un repos de seize heuresconsecutives devrait etre accorde.III. Methodes de contr6le6. Tout en respectant le principe con-tenu dans le paragraphe 12 de la recom-mandation sur 1&apos;inspection du travail,1923, aux termes duquel 1&apos;inspection doitcomprendre des hommes et des femmespossedant les memes pouvoirs et fonctionset exercant la meme autorite, il convien-drait de tenir compte de 1&apos;experience decertains pays selon laquelle il est par-ticulierement satisfaisant de confier a desinspectrices le controle de la legislationprotegeant les jeunes travailleurs.7. En sus du controle normal de1&apos;application de la legislation protegeantles jeunes travailleurs, il conviendrait,pour assurer 1&apos;application effective des dispositions de la convention sur le travailde nuit des adolescents (travaux nonindustriels), 1946, aux activires non indus-trielles qui s&apos;exercent sous une forme dis-persee dans une multitude de petites entre-prises,   d&apos;attacher   une   attention   par-
8. When deciding on the form of docu-ment which the employer shall be requiredby law to keep for the purpose of furnishingthe inspection services with the means ofsupervising the enforcement of the regula-tions restricting night work, it is desirableto take into consideration the advantages of the work permit or the workbook which,as they must be issued or officially stampedon each change of employment, make iteasy to identify the young worker, provideproof of age and fix his conditions of work,including working hours.9. (1) In order to facilitate the identified-fication by official supervisory services of young itinerant workers protected by the laws or regulations concerning nightwork (a) young itinerant workers working forwages should carry on their persona document and a badge which will permit their identification outsidethe undertaking, in addition to the documents kept by the employer ;(6) young itinerant workers working ontheir own account or on account oftheir parents should carry on theirperson a document authorising their employment and a badge which will permit their identification.(2) Young itinerant workers undereighteen years of age should be provided with a work permit or an individual licencecontaining (a) the name, age and address of the child or young person ;(6) the photograph or signature of the child or young person or other meansof identification and his permit orlicence number;(c) if the child or young person is employed .for wages, the name and address of the employer and his hours of work ; and(d) if the child or young person is working on his own account or on account ofhis parents, the name and address ofhis parents and their authorisation.(3) It is desirable that the work permitor individual licence should be issued by a service under the labour department.(4) A young itinerant worker should be obliged to wear the badge which bears hispermit or licence number so that it will be readily visible.8. Dans le choix de la piece officielle que1&apos;employeur sera tenu par la loi de gardera la disposition des services d&apos;inspectionpour donner a ceux-ci le moyen decontroler 1&apos;application de la reglementationlimitant le travail de nuit, il conviendraitde prendre en consideration les avantages,du permis d&apos;emploi et du livret de travailqui, devant etre etablis ou devant recevoirune estampille officielle lors de chaquechangement d&apos;emploi, facilitent 1&apos;identified-fication du jeune travailleur, la preuve deson age et la determination de ses con-ditions de travail, y compris 1&apos;horaire de1&apos;emploi.9.

(5) The full co-operation of localauthorities, and particularly that of thepreventive police, if such exists, of educa-tional authorities and of child welfareauthorities with inspection services, shouldbe obtained in order to ensure supervision of the working hours of young itinerantworkers and the enforcement of the laws and regulations relating to night work.(6) The employer should be held legallyresponsible for violations of the laws or regulations, and in particular for any dis-proportion between the volume of work tobe required and the time available for its performance during permitted working hours ; the employer should be given theopportunity to vindicate his good faithif he exercised all due diligence to preventthe violation.(7) Parents should, after previous warn-ing, be held legally responsible for viola-tions of the laws or regulations when theoccupation is carried on on their accountor with their authorisation.The foregoing is the authentic text ofthe Recommendation duly adopted by theGeneral Conference of the InternationalLabour Organisation during its Twenty-ninth Session which was held at Montrealand declared closed the ninth day ofOctober 1946.IN FAITH WHEREOF we haveappended our signatures this first day ofNovember 1946. ..-The President of the Conference,HUMPHREY MITCHELL.The Director-General of the InternationalLabour Office,EDWARD PHELAN.(5) II conviendrait d&apos;obtenir la pleinecollaboration des autorites locales, notam-mentdes services de police preventive, desautorites scolaires et des autorites de&apos;protection de l&apos;enfance, avec les servicesde 1&apos;inspection du travail pour assurer lecontrole des horaires de ces jeunestravailleurs ambulants et l&apos;application dela legislation sur le travail de nuit.(6) L&apos;employeur devrait etre tenu re-sponsable en cas d&apos;infraction a la legisla-tion, notamment s&apos;il s&apos;agit d&apos;une disproportionately-portion entre les services exiges et le tempsdisponible pour les executer dans leslimites de 1&apos;horaire de service autorise ;la possibility devrait dtre offerte a1&apos;employeur&apos; d&apos;etablir sa bonne foi s&apos;il apris toutes precautions voulues pourprevenir 1&apos;infraction,(7) Si le travail est execute&quot; pour lecompte des parents ou avec leur autorisa-tion, il conviendrait, apres un avertisse-ment, de tenir ceux-ci responsables de1&apos;infraction.Le texte qui precede est le texte authenticated-tique de la recommandation dument adoptee par la Conference ,gehefale de1&apos;Organisation internationale du Travaildans sa vingt-neuvieme session qui s&apos;s&apos;est tenue a Montreal et qui a eti declarer closele neufoctobre 1946.EN FOI DE QUOI ont appose leurssignatures, ce premier jour de novembre1946.Le President de la Conference,HUMPHREY MITCHELL.Le Directeurgendral du Bureau international du Travail, ,EDWARD PHELAN.APPENDIX VTEXTS OF THE RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE CONFERENCE:&apos;:&apos;;.&apos;!:&apos;.: .&apos; ,x;.;&apos;.&apos;&apos;      / &apos; V \ &apos; vRESOLUTION CONCERNING THE PROMPT RATIFICATION OF THE IN-instrument FOR THE AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THEINTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION, 1946, AND THE FINALARTICLES REVISION CONVENTION, 1946, ADOPTED BY THE INTER-NATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE AT ITS 29TH SESSION(Adopted on 9 October 1946)The Conference expresses its keen appreciation of the prompt ratification by theMembers of the Organisation of the Constitution of the International Labour OrganisationInstrument of Amendment, 1945, and ventures to hope that Members of the organisation will find it possible to ratify equally promptly the Constitution of the International LabourOrganisation Instrument of Amendment, 1946, and the Final Articles Revision Convention,( 1946, and that these Instruments may be in force before the opening of the next generalsession of the International Labour Conference.
