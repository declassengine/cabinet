(1+7) 65th Conclusions, Minute 2) had a preliminary discussion about the Balance of Payments and asked me tomake a series of proposals for action,  to-be considered attheir meeting on Friday, 1st August.I-      PRESENT POSITION2. First let me summarise the main facts of the presentposition..     These are very simple and very unpleasant.      Iwarned the Cabinet on 5th June last that &quot;if the present rate of drawing on the United States Credit continued, thisCredit would be exhausted as early as the end of 191+7&quot; *     Itis now quite clear that, at the present rate of drawing,the Credit will not last beyond November and will probablybe exhausted in October, or even possibly in September.There is no reason for hoping that, unless we take newdecisions and appropriate action, the rate of drawing will-fall in the near future.3. - The U.K. deficit with the Americas for mid-191+7 -mid-191+S according to the latest estimates will be about 600 million.     Any diminution of this figure from surplusesarising with the rest of the world can only be small anduncertain.1+. When the United States Credit is gone, we shall beback on what will then remain of the Canadian Credit, probably not more than $1+00 millions ( 100 millions) in November (andnot available as we need it), and our other final reserves ofgold and dollars which are somewhat less than  600 millions.These are the reservess not only of ourselves, but of thewhole sterling area.5* If, therefore, when the United States Credit isexhausted, we were to make no change in policy, but were to start drawing on our reserves, those reserves would be
completely exhausted within a few months.     No-one couldadvocate such a course.6. We are faced in this matter with a most unpleasantdilemma.      If, when the U,S. Credit runs out, it is clear    -that we should get no aid, or inadequate aid, from the marshall Plan, we should have to embark, on a major reversal of our economic policy.     The only course open to us would&quot;then be to secure our supplies by a process of bilateralbargaining which would be inconsistent with the obligations of the Loan Agreement.      Such a policy would involve many difficulties and sacrifices.   &apos; But, above all, it would stand &apos;no change of success, unless we started upon it with our reserves, intact.7. But it is only too likely that in October it will still be quite uncertain how much aid Europe, and inparticular this country, will get from the U.S.     Thenegotiations under the Marshall Plan will probably hecontinuing and we shall be under the strongest pressure notto alter our existing economic policy,  even though this ,--involves drawing upon our reserves.8. The Cabinet are not called upon to resolve thisdilemma immediately, but its existence makes it essentialthat we should not shrink from immediate and drastic measuresto conserve our reserves.      Once they have, been seriouslyreduced below their present level, we should be leftdefenceless against any conditions, no matter how intolerable,which the U.S. Government might wish to impose upon us.Further, any action decided upon now will take several months to show its results in saving foreign exchange so that if weare to prevent a critical drain on our reserves as soon asthe U.S. Credit is exhausted, we must act now.11&apos;     ACT-ION &quot;PROPOSED9. We shall only escape from the present position bya bold programme of measures covering the whole front and, inparticular -(l)    An increase in productivity leading to(a) a larger volume of exports;(b) increased production of certain goods&apos;&quot;   which would otherwise have to be imported.Agriculture is the outstanding example.(2)   A curtailment of expenditure on imports;(3)   A review of all overseas commitments, which are-equivalent to imports, and.of their effecton the balance of payments.10. Such a programme will mean a loss of amenities andsome austerity, if not hardship.     But it is the only alternative to a much worse fate coming upon us within a. fewmonths.     It is essential that the programme should be putacross in a way which will make our people believe, what isthe truth, that such measures are essential to their salvation.It must also give them confidence in the future of thiscountry, provided that all play their part.
III.    INCREASES IN PRODUCTIVITY AND EXPORTSXX * Q.c s.X *     The target for the present &quot;coal year&quot; (i.e.May,. 1947 to May, 19h8) must be stepped up to 220 toI llri an teams,of -c-OfSili including.&quot; open-cc-.st*     This target-gIIogbs enough-for full prjducti-n in British., industry met. f or substantialCKp.orts* . -12, Steel.  ^ The target should be Ih million tons in191(8,  allocation being primarily to goods directed to export andto such special U.K. needs as coal,  transport and electricitygener at ion.13* Engineering.      Subject only to due regard to the re-equipment of our own export industries, a greater emphasismust be placed on export.  . Thus the export of motorcars shouldbe stepped up to. 75 per cent, of production and a part of thepresent steel allocation should be switched from the productionof motorcars to the production of agricultural machinery forexport.111. Textiles.      Total production should be increased toa level which will give exports of a value of  250 million a year, without any reduction in the present ihulue of.coupons.     Every effort should be made to increase productionbeyond this point and any such further increase should be shared -between exports and home consumption,15. Food Production.     The target should be an additional 100 millions a year of agricultural production,  to be achieved by 1951 at the latest.     There should also be a vigorouscampaign to encourage production of vegetables in allotmentsand gardens.   . In order to make full use of home grown fruit, .the war-time scheme for supplying sugar for jam making to women&apos;s Institutes shriuld be revived.16, Direction of Exports.     There should be a specialconcent-ration of exports on the most appropriate markets,17* Volume of Exports.     Our aim must be 11+0 per- cent,of 1938 in the second quarter of 191(8, and 150 per cent, bythe end of 19h8.     Production in excess of this level wouldmake it possible to increase supplies to the home market.     this target will be difficult, to achieve but we must not fall short of it.18. Goods Transport.     Railways and road haulage must begiven the necessary resources to enable them to meet the heavy strain which will be imposed by increased productivity.19. Home Market.   , Investment will have to. be curtailed, -except where it contributes to export or to import saving.This will mean some slowing down of new building and   of housingexcept in so far as they help to .increase productivity, e.g.the provision of housing for special priority groups.20. Hours of Work.    &apos; The workers in many industries have secured a shorter&apos; standard working week.      This should not beinterfered with.     But in the present, situation the workers,particularly those in the basic industries, must be prepared towork additional hours, over end above the standard week,whether by way of overtime or otherwise.
21, Re-deployment of Labour.     We must consult both sides of industry on this.     The aim should be to distribute labour from the less essential to the more essential industries.     Todo this it will be necessary to re-enact the Control of engagement Order.      To make this fully effective, all employersmust be required to engage workers through the employment exchange, and the power of direction must be invoked againstrecalcitrant workers.22* Efficiency of Management.      The appropriate Departmentsmust have power to take action where the management of a firmis inefficient and impedes production.IV.    REDUCTION IN EXPENDITURE ON IMPORTS23. Raw. Materials.     None of these can be cut much, except-perhaps timber.     The original programme for this for 19li7/48was  91 millions, including  60 millions hard currency.This should be cut by  10 millions.     It might also be possibleto make a saving of some millions by postponing part of ourcotton purchases.- Film Remittances.     We must make a heavy cut here,though the total is not large.     There are several alternatives,the imposition of a heavy import duty, an embargo on all newimports (but this would not catch remittances on films already in this country), or an agreement with the Americans to leavethe dollars here until we are willing that they should begin to draw on them.     On this last possibility the Americans have promised to make early proposals.     We should aim ft saving atleast  7 millions in 19147/14.8 out of a total of  15 millions.25. Foreign Travel.     I propose that as from 1st Octobernext we should reduce the allowance from  75 for 12 months to 35 for Hi months.     This would save  12 millions a year outof  30 millions.     I am also arranging to limit more strictlybusiness allowances and to save on this a further  3 millions a year, out of  10 millions.26. Petrol.      It has already been decided to save Shmillions out of  87 millions by reducing the basic ration as from 1st October and by making some cut in commercial use.     We must do more than this.     I propose, a further cut on commercial and service user.27, Tobacco.     The cut in tobacco consumption resultingfrom the increased duty is already saving us  10 millions ayear, and this year we are making an additional saving of  10millions by reduction of stocks to the new consumption level.The total saving will thus be  20 millions, or more if pricesfall heavily.28, Other Consumer G-oods.     We should make further smallsavings here amounting to  5 millions a year, but none of this willbe from hard currency sources.29* Food.      I propose that we should at once announce thatwe are going to stop buying over a large range of dollar foods.This would tend to bring down prices, but to strengthen this tendency we should also announce a reduction in our consumptionof these goods whether rationed or unrationed, thus creating theimpression that our market for these goods is contracting.     We-h-
should not anounce&apos;for how long we are- going to stop buying thevarious, articles concerned, but should leave this deliberatelyindefinite.30. Our aim must be to make the United Kingdom a buyer&apos;smarket for food,  and thus to break the&apos;present outrageousprices which we are having to. pay.The total of the savings which could be effected inthis way, on the assumption that- buying was discontinued overthe period to 31st December, 19h7, is  85.9 millions.     this includes  13.6 millions for feeding stuffs.     These are essential to any increase in our domestic production of food and I suggest that they be omitted from the savings which Ipropose.   The other items are as follows:-  million(l)    Items, of which distribution could bemaintained from stocks to the end of* the year or dispensed with altogether,e.g. animal fats, rabbits and poultry,canned- meat products, bacon and ham,canned fish, condensed milk, dried fruit,fresh fruit and nuts, canned fruit and vegetables, coffee;    (in the case ofsome of these items the figure does not cover the whole of our supplies as someis already covered by contracts) h7*3(2)    Less items which will be stopped   in anycase to achieve (for the six months)the reduction in the import programme already decided on by the Cabinet 25 22.3,Other items -(3)    Wheat from U.S.A. 11(h)    Carcase meat- from U.S.A. -       23(5)    Cheese from U.S.A. 9(6)   Dried eggs (in bulk from U.S.A. and canada) 7- V*      OVERSEAS COMMITMENTS31. The two main items of foreign exchange expenditure arecivil supplies for Germany and the cost of military forcesabroad.32. Germany.     We are liable for half the deficit in thebale nee of payments of the combined Zone.     The current estimateof our liability is  80 millions a year, of which at least Sh5millions are dollars.
33* Overseas. Military Exoenditure.     Our gross liability in foreign currencies at the present time is running atroughly  li+O millions in the main areas overseas apart frompetrol and food which are included in the United-Kingdomrequirements.  .The distribution of troops, is as follovi/s:-Number of men inarea on 1st July.Germany 130,000Austria 18,000Italy and Venezia Giulia                                25,000Greece 9,000Palestine ,                95,000Egypt 59,000Rest of Middle East 34,000India .                            43,000Burma          ,. 11,000Rest of Par East, principally Malaya            50,000Other areas 26,000Total: 500.0003k* I recommend that the number of ts-troops in &apos;tttosoojreras sitoujii be produced oy-J5CX^XX)0 by--tho.-sDndJc^^ho^i^ljan&amp;crjyear-.35, The size of the Armed Forces at home and abroad isnow 1,301,000 and is planned to fall to 1,087,000 by31st March, 191+8,     I am sure&apos; that we. should now decide ona quicker rundown to a lower figure.VI.      CONCLUSION36. It is impossible to produce at this stage a balance sheet for the Balance of Payments over the next 12 months.On the income side much will depend on realising the proposed increase in coal production and the other priorities for exports,37* What we must keep in &apos;mind is that we have a prospectivecurrency deficit with the Americas of  600 millions for mid-19l47-mid-19Li.8.     Whatever we do at the moment, we shall continue for some time to be in a hopelessly unbalanced position, unless we get very early and substantial new assistance in dollars,38. But, even if everything goes smoothly on the programmeI outline above, we may well be involved in reducing our finalreserves below the danger level.     Thus, as the year&quot;goes on* wemay have to take still more drastic measures.     But nothing lessthan the policy I have indicated above in its entirety will, I earnestly submit to my colleagues, meet the very grave immediateperils which confront us.An all powers Bill39* I am inclined to think that there would be both
practical usefulness and. great dramatic value in passing such a Bill as the Emergency Powers (Defence)Act, 19U-0, which the present Prime Minister introduced in May, 191+0,.    Parliamentary Counsel are considering what- modification would he necessary to fit thepresent situation.H.D.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,,31st July, 19U7..
