(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)SECRET%    0* P. (47) 225 COPY NO. ^ [UTH AUGUST,  19/4-7CABINETEXTENSION OF THE FIVE-DAY WEEK TO THE ANCILLARYUNDERTAKINGS OF THE NATIONAL COAL board memorandum by the Minister of.Fuel and PowerIt may be useful for the Cabinet to have the followingsummary of the negotiations between the National Coal Board andthe National Union of Mineworkers and of the present positionand possible repercussions.      This should be read in conjunc-tion with my memorandum to the Lord President&apos;s Committee(L. P. (1+7) 127 of 22nd July).18th April. 1 9/4.7.     The Five-Day Week Agreement (between theNational Coal Board and the, National Unionof Mineworkers).Ari agreement for the introduction ofthe Five-Day week into the &quot;coal mining industry&quot; which prescribed new hours ofwork for &quot;underground workers&quot; and for&quot;surface .workers in or about collieries&quot;.5th June, 19U7. Interpretive Agreement (between theNational Coal Board and the National Unionof Mineworkers).Provided that the Five-Day Week Agree-ment should apply to &quot;all workers in theCoal Mining Industry who are subject to thedecisions of the Coal Mining Industry ofGreat Britain Conciliation Scheme&quot; but should not apply to &quot;workers engaged in ancillary undertakings&quot;.^NOTE:    It is this which makes it difficult for the National Union- of Mineworkers to goto arbitration because they have already agreed to exclude ancillarieSjJT&quot;21st June, 19/4.7,        The National Coal Board consult the Ministryof Fuel and Power in view of National Unionof Mineworkers pressure to go further thanthe Interpretive Agreement of 5th June.The Ministry express the view (23rd.June,19/4.7) that extension is a matter on whichthe Board should seek guidance from theGovernment, and the.Board concur.% 26th June, 19/4-7.       Minister of Fuel and Power advises Ministerof Labour and others concerned of position&apos;.
3rd July, 1947. National Coal Board and National Union of- Mineworkers agree oh a formula (Annex l)which, in effect, confirms the.Inter-,pretive Agreement of 5th June.      this formula brings in colliery craftsmen suchas. joiners, bricklayers&quot; employed bycollieries but specifically excludesworkers in activities which clearly have nothing to do with coalmining.     TheMinister of Fuel and Power is apprised ofthis formula, agrees that it avoids the1   issue of national policy raised by- theearlier proposals,  and informs Minister ofLabour who concurs.17th July, 19,47*       The National Union of Mineworkers now claim that the formula was only &quot;provisionally&quot;agreed (there was in fact no signed agree-ment) and that it is not satisfactory.      Anew formula (Annex II) is discussed withthe Board.      It is broadly on the lines ofthat of 3rd July but does not excludeancillaries.     The National Coal Boardindicate their inability to settle on this basis without guidance from the Government.25th July, 1947.       The Lord President&apos;s Committee considermemorandum by. the Minister of Fuel-&apos;and power, who conveys Government&apos;s decisionto the National Coal Board on 28th July -that it would not be proper for the board to agree to the Union&apos;s application.Board accept this view and advise Unionthat they are unable to accede to theapplication.30th July, 1947.        Ignoring advice given by Minister of labour that, if dissatisfied with the National coal board&apos;s reply, the National Union of Mine-workers&apos; right course is. to invoke arbitra-tion provisions of the Conciliation Agree-ment, the Union raise the matter at meeting with the Prime Minister.The reason for stopping where we are is that to go furtherwould take us across a line of principle - i.e. from coal mining industry to other activities having nothing to do with coal such&quot;-   as brickmaking, engineering (central&apos;workshops) railways, etc.The numbers immediately involved in the proposed extension of&apos; the formula are probably not large but might include over 1,000out of 2,900 brickworkers employed by the Board, 3/4,000 out of6,900s engineers in central workshops, a few hundred out of6,500 oven workers and odd pockets employed in various otherancillaries 7 say, 7,000 or 8,000 altogether.But could the National Coal Board possibly avoid laterextension to include all brickworkers and engineers on theirbooks?     The Board do not think so.      So the numbers mightquickly mount to 15,000 or more.      Then, there might well berepercussions outside.   -E. S.Ministry of Fuel and Power,S. W. 1.4TH AUGUST, 1947.
