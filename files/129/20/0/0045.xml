TRADE NEGOTIATIONS IN GENEVAU.S.  REQUESTS ON TARIFFS AND PREFERENCESMEMORANDUM BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF trade.     At the meeting of the Cabinet on 7th August the view taken by my colleagues in respect of the negotiations on tariffs and preferences was that preferences which we enjoyshould not bo reduced in any. particular case where serious damage to an important export would result, and that in total   we should not go further than justified by the concessions offered to us.   This position to be held evenif it involved a breakdown.2.     We have since been under very heavy pressure from the americans in Geneva to go further in respect of the preferences which we enjoy in Commonwealth markets than these decisions would permit.    Mr. Clayton himself came to london on 20th. August specially to represent his point of view toma*     (A note of the conversation is attached as Annex C,which my colleagues may already have seen as telegram N0.I5OI+Neutral of 21st August) ,3*     Briefly the point of view of the Americans is that theyhave done everything possible to meet us on the short term(notably on non-discrimination, where we have secured resultscompletely conforming to the decisions of Ministers at their meeting on the 8th August - see Annex D),     They claim thatwe are morally committed to make substantial progress onpreferences   and that our present - to their mindsinadequate - offers in this field do not carry out thespirit of our commitments.U*     These commitments (which are set out in full in Annex E)are contained in the Atlantic Charter, in Article VII of the mutual Aid Agreement, in the Proposals for consideration byan International Conference on Trade and Employment (Cmd.6709),to which we expressed our agreement on all important points at the time of signing of the Loan Agreement, and in thePrime Minister&apos;s speech to the House of Commons on 6th December, 19h7 when announcing tho Loan Agreement and theCommercial Policy proposals.      In general our commitment isthat we would be prepared to reduce preferences in return for adequate concessions.    I elaborated on this in a Debate inthe  House of Commons shortly before the negotiations atGeneva opened, and spoke in somewhat firm terms about theneed for adequate compensation in return for any reductions in preferences.5.     Whatever we may think about the adequacy of the offerswhich the United States have made to us and the rest of theCommonwealth, there is no. doubt at all that the Americans(and particularly Mr. Clayton)  are genuinely convinced thatthey have made a generous offer to the participants in the geneva negotiations, and that they have been greatly disappointedwith the responses.they have received.6.     That the Americans feel deeply on this matter is shown by   two further pieces of evidence:-(a)    they have mentioned to our negotiators in theFinancial Talks in Washington the extreme disappointmentof their Delegation at Geneva at our negative response.
(b)    there is good reason, to suppose that unless they- think there is a real intention on our part to negotiate with them on   the basis they are now suggesting (see paragraph 7 below),they will break off negotiations, with all the consequencesthat will follow, not merely in the field of commercial policy but also in the fields covered by the Conference in paris and by the Loan Agreement.    Indeed the leader of the CanadianDelegation &apos; (Mr; Wilgress, lately Canadian Ambassador in Moscow)has represented forcibly to our Delegation in Geneva that-the decision on preferences may well turn out to be the critical decision of the year, and that if the Americansbreak off negotiations at Geneva now it may well mean thatthey will write-off the United Kingdom and Western Europe.7*     Moreover, Mr. Clayton has made it abundantly clear thatin order &quot;to sell&quot; an agreement which will contain the complete freedom in the short-term to discriminate against them which they now contemplate, they must be able to point to long term arrangements of a comprehensive nature and whichsatisfy their own political preoccupations.   Mr. Clayton inusing such language .is of course referring to the expectation,to which the Congress, and&quot; the American public have long been accustomed, of substantial cuts in the Imperial Preferencesystem, which they regard as discriminatory.     As mentionedabove, Mr. Clayton has pressed this point very hard.   Aspart of his approach to me he indicated that his delegation were trying in their turn to come some way to meet us.They    had decided not to press their requests for eliminationin a number of cases (though the requests still pressed are serious enough) and they were prepared to accept a number ofour offers which fall short of elimination.8.     We, on the other hand, have our own political preoccupations,which    I have made clear repeatedly to the Americans.    I donot    think I need enlarge on this beyond saying that the public and Parliaments of Commonwealth countries are apprehensive that serious cuts.in preferences will be made without fairrecompense.   The effects of a reduction in preferences onour trading position may well extend beyond the items  .immediately affected.   There will, in any event, be a greatoutcry from those of our main exporting industries whichsee their preferences reduced or eliminated.    It is significant that the retention of margins of preference wasa point emphasised by nearly all industries when weconsulted them before we entered the negotiations.9.     So far as the economic merits of the argument areconcerned our negotiators feel that our present offersrepresent a fair balance.    It is of course at any time amatter of the utmost difficulty to say exactly -what theeffect of a reduction of a tariff rate or a preferencemargin will be.   The most that can&apos; be attempted in anystatistical appraisement is to show the amount of establishedtrade which stands to gain from a tariff concession or is put at risk by a loss of preference.    In present daycircumstances when &quot;trade is influenced far more by foreign exchange considerations and by import controls, andwhen   costs are so much out of line, a forecast is even moredifficult.    None the less, I feel.that after allowing for allthese uncertainties we can claim that we and the americans have made each, other offers which approximately balance.
Roughly it might be said that the concessions we have offered in the United Kingdom protective tariff are just about in balance with the concessions in the United States tariffwhich they have offered directly to tfs (see the figures in annex In addition we have concurred in offers affectingthe preferences which we enjoy in Commonwealth markets.These are fully adequate when set against the general increase.of dollar earnings which may be expected to result from the -American offer to the negotiating countries as awhole.    This is of great importance to the United Kino-dom,since the nature of our trade is such that we have alwaysearned the major part of our dollars by exports to countrieswhich in their turn export to the United States.    Moreover,there is a hidden concession to us in the whole of any agreement we may reach with the United States,  in that theirtariff concessions will operate forthwith.    So far as theUnited Kingdom is concerned our imports are controlled bylicences and not by tariffs and it is only as we come outof balance of payments difficulties that our own. tariffrates will have any relevance.    How far this argument applies to margins of preference which we may concede in commonwealth countries is not so clear since it depends on the extent towhich the Commonwealth as a whole will be forced by shortageof dollars to discriminate against United States exports.10.    I feel sure that my colleagues will agree that we canneither stick on our present position with the virtualcertainty of a break down, nor can we accept the-Americanterms   as they now stand, even though they have withdrawna very large number of requests for the elimination of preferences with which they began the negotiations,11,    We can neither afford a break down with all thepolitical consequences that would follow, nor can we afford to have it said that for the second time we have sold something in order to get out of commitments which we should never have entered into* in return for inadequate, assistance underdamaging conditions in 1945*12,    A possible line of action would be to offer, inaddition to the offers already made within the framework of the present Cabinet decision a comparatively few.concessions on preferences which would really hurt us.      Itis, however, highly doubtful whether, granted that some morepreferences have got to go, we should be getting the best possible value for them in return or indeed whether theUnited States would regard such.a limited approach as justifying.them in continuing negotiations.13.    I recommend therefore that we should attempt to meetthe Americans halfway on their new requests (in themselvesvery much less than their original demands)  and to endeavourto get really worthwhile concessions in return.   This wouldinvolve on our side fairly substantial concessions inpreferenoe   by way of elimination which would, togetherwith the concessions we have already offered put at greater or less risk a noticeable though not large (say under i.u/0;proportion of our exports to the Commonwealth.sk The figure relates to concessions coveredby U. S. requests.    Offers made in respect-of items on other countries&apos; account might increase the figure by 5 per cent orthereabouts.
I do not propose any additional offers of reductions sincethe Americans appear to attach, much more importance toeliminations,   A few additional minor reductions might however be conceded if necessary to clinch an agreement.14.    On the other hand I would press the Americans to gosubstantially further in reducing their obstacles to imports,.I do not think that there is very much more that we couldsuccessfully ask them to do, on their actual customs tariffas it applies to our principal exports, though we shouldnaturally seek any marginal concession we could get.    Moreuseful concessions could, in my view, be obtained by Americanundertakings which would ease the entry into the U.S.A. oftwo of the largest dollar earning imports from our colonial empire - natural rubber and vegetable oils (details in annex G-),    Further assistance to imports into the U.S.A.could be obtained by a reform of U. S, Customs administration(details in Annex H), I am not clear whether it would betacitly wise to include this in a bargain on tariffs butin any case the Canadians, who will be also giving up certainpreferences if the negotiations are successful, may wellwish to take up this matter,15,    Concessions on these matters would greatly increase the dollar earning potentialities of the Commonwealth-and notablyof the Colonial Empire,    We know however that the americans have no authority to negotiate on these points nor to give-effect to such concessions under the Reciprocal trade agreements Act.    Any such concessions would require special legislation by Congress.    The technique we should have to employ would therefore be to put in our additional offers intwo categories one to come into effect immediately, the otherwhen they had taken the necessary Congressional action.In this way we should be able to assist the State Department,in their policy of reducing trade barriers in American bynutting pressure on Congress while at the same txme enabling them to answer the criticism that we had not carried out our commitments by pointing to valuable concessions on preferencewhich we stood ready to make at any time that the price were paid.   The difficulty of this approach (if it is a difficulty;is that it would put certain important exporting industries under the threat of losing a preferential advantage at someindefinite time in the future.16.    Our negotiators arc already in consultation with the other commonwealth Delegations at Geneva with a view to ascertainingtheir reaction to an agreement on these lines.17*    One point of considerable difficulty may arise in these consultations.    The-  Americans have requested the elimination of the margin of preference enjoyed by Canada in theAustralian max^ket on substantially the whole of the itemscomprised under the general heading of motor cars (principallymotor car chassis - unassembled).     This is a complicatedstory since the rate which the Canadians are charged inAustralia is approximately half way between the rate whichthe   Anericans pay and the rate applicable to our exports.If, therefore, the Canadians for their part were to consent to the elimination of their margin of preference and we did not object,&apos;our margin as compared with the americans would be halved, while we should retain our existingadvantage over the Canadians.    In terms of pre-war tradein these items we ourselves supplied  3.0 millions,  theUnited States  2.1 millions and the Canadians  2.1 millions .out of a total of our imports into Australia . 7*3 millions.
18.    Since the request made by the Americans is for elimination -tions of. the advantage which Canada enjoys, the- Canadianattitude on this item may well bo decisive. Our negotiatorswill seek to dissuade the Canadians from agreeing to this item in which case no further question will arise.    If, however,it turns out that the Canadians feel that this is an itemon which they must agree to elimination, we shall be facedwith a difficult. situation, i.e,.a choice between beingresponsible ourselves for withholding from the bargain an itemto which the Americans attach very great importance or on theother hand, of consenting to a reduction in our own margin of preference at a time when the Minister of Supply isnegotiating with our own industry with a view to rationalisation-tion and standardisation.- I have agreed with him that ifthe Canadians .press us to allow this item to be included, .I will discuss the matter again with him.19.    I give below (at Annex A)  the necessary figures on whicha broad judgment of the issues involved can be obtained.,It will be seen that as regards elimination of preferenceswe enjoy in the four Commonwealth markets concerned (i.e,excluding India) we shall be offering to cover,.on pre-warfigures, only  3.0 million of our trade as compared with anoriginal U.S. request on  21,9 million and a total volume ofUnited Kingdom exports to these markets of  119.3 million.I also append a list of the actual items concerned (Annex B;.I have used these suggestions in compiling the figuresbelow, and have agreed with the Minister of Supply the itemswhith which he is concerned. -R.S.

ANNEX&apos;CNote of Discussions between President of the Board of Tradeand Mr. Clayton on 20th August, 19U7,(Telegram No. I50h Neutral of. 21st August, 191+7 from foreign Office to United Kingdom&apos;Delegation, Geneva)Meeting between President of the Board of Trade andClayton took place during afternoon of 20th August.    There.were also present on United Kingdom side; Secretary for   -Overseas. Trade and Holmes, and on United States, side. UnitedStates Ambassador and Clair Y/ilcox and Beale from Geneva.- 2,      Clayton opened the discussion by making it clear thatthe success or otherwise of the negotiations would be judgedin the United States by the extent to which the UnitedStates Delegation succeeded in &quot;cracking Imperial Preference&quot;,He claimed that in present circumstances Imperial Preferencemust be regarded as relatively unimportant.    It rated in; relation to the convertibility and discrimination issues as 1(or even 0) to 10 and 3 respectively.      At several points inthe discussion he hinted that we. would secure a much morefavourable reception for our other needs at this junctureif we showed a real willingness to go far towards the elimination -tion of individual preferences of some importance and toaccept United States proposals in other cases for substantial reductions of preferences.   He claimed that as compared withthe Hawley-Smeet Tariff, United States tariffs after thepresent negotiations, if their offer could be confirmed inthe light of what they were receiving, would have been shot .to ,pieces and that very full advantage was being taken ofthe 50 per cent reduction allowed by the Reciprocal trade agreements Act.    In some cases (he instanced the rubber and tin bindings) this was being done against great pressure and strong protests had been received in respect of proposed reductions in the tariff on woollen goods.3.   ; At&quot;this point he produced figures, the object of whichwas to demonstrate that in terms of United States trade withother parts of the Commonwealth the preferences remainingif we did not improve on our offers would at best be bothhigh and wide, i.e.  the reductions were small in themselves and related to a small range of items only up to the point ofthe Colonial preferences where we proposed to make no concessions at all.    Beale indicated that we should be put inpossession of the figures which Clayton, quoted in respectof the preferences we enjoyed.      In the case of the southern dominions it was claimed that as against eliminations requestedin respect of items on which United States trade amounted to35 million dollars, eliminations conceded covered only  million dollars of United States trade, though admittedlyin some eases we had offered a reduction of the margin.h.      As an instance, on the&apos; other hand, of the generosityof the United States offers (though not to us) Clayton mentionedwool.    Here the Administration had secured the veto of theRobertson Bill, had resisted demands that the tariff shouldbe increased and had actually secured Presidential approval to an offer to reduce the tariff by 25 per cent.
5*      As further instance of United States attempts to help us, Clayton referred to Article 28 and particularly to theassimilation we had secured for countries with convertiblecurrencies to the position of countries whose currencies wereinconvertible;    also to the United States willingness toaccept complete latitude for one year in rospect^of non-^discrimination obligations.    He said that this did not, ofcourse, itself affect our obligations under Article 9 ofthe Credit agreement which was at present&apos; under discussion in. Washingtoni6.     Above general account of United States demands did notpass unchallenged.    It was emphasised by the President andothers on United Kingdom side that the obligation not tointroduce new preferences or.to increase existing ones orto restore preferences reduced or eliminated in course of present negotiations represented a much more onerous under-taking than the obligations which countries were proposing toaccept in respect of tariffs and Clayton admitted that united States tariff reductions could be set aside though he thought that such action on the part either of Congressor the Administration &quot;was highly improbable even at end ofinitial period of&apos; three years.    He felt that we could quitesafely assume that public opinion in the United States wouldnot stand for the reversal of the tariff policy on which theUnited States were embarked.    He admitted the great political difficulties which any wholesale dismantlement of the -preferential system would create for us especially at this time but claimed that the United States had their difficultiestoo and that the stormy waters in which we found ourselvescould not leave the United States political waters unruffled.7.      We pointed out that our calculations suggested thaton balance, our offers,, oven without the preferencereductions to which we were already proposing to agree, were at least as good in terms of trade as the,United Statesoffers to us,  that the field of concessions by the UnitedStates was not a very wide ono so far as we.were concerned as compared with our trade with the Commonwealth, and thatthe negotiations could not be said to have mutuallyadvantageous results unless they led to some redress of present hopelessly uneven balance of trade.8.     The United States representatives claimed that theunderstanding between us in&apos; the Proposals linked with theLoan Agreement did not justify us in setting preferencereductions or eliminations against substantial reductions of the United ^States tariff but that we were committed to substantial lowering of trade barriers on both sides, thetreatment of preferences being, as it were, a separate matter.We did not accept this interpretation and repeatedly stressed the heavy obligation represented for us by the&apos;undertakingnot to increase or restore preferences which was not effectivelymatched by any corresponding obligation on the straignttariff side.    We also pointed to thevloss of trade in theUnited States and other markets resulting from the effortswe had put forward during the war and emphasised thedifficulty of regaining our position against even reducedtariffs.9.     The President made it clear, to the professeddisappointment and even alarm of the United states representatives, that it would be quite impossible for themto expect spectacular eliminations and that political andpublic opinion, especially in present circumstances, would react very strongly against any such thing.    Many people
of very; different shades of political views would feel thatthe virtual abandonment of the preferential system wasdiametrically opposed to our interests and that indeed we might well have to look to closer economic links with theCommonwealth,10.    There was some discussion at this point of the UnitedStates attitude to customs unions as distinct frompreferential systems, the completely Illogical positionadopted by Clayton being fully realised by Wilcox&apos; whoattempted to turn the discussion to the positive obligationsaccepted by us from the early days of our contacts duringthe war from the Atlantic Charter onwards.    Were we endeavour-ing to go back on what we had all along agreed to do by wayof elimination of preference?     We pointed out that theremust be, in our view, a reasonable balance and also thatthere was no undertaking to achieve everything at once.   ;What we had offered to do represented a remarkable step inthe direction of elimination;    further steps might bepossible in the course of subsequent rounds of negotiations.This was surely a good start from the United States point ofview taken in circumstances of extreme difficulty.^,.11.-  United States representatives reverted to suggestionpreviously made that we might find it .easier to eliminateby stages, i.e.  that we should undertake obligations now to eliminate by 20 per&apos;cent per annum for five years.    (no suggestion was made that the initial cut should bedisproportionately large.)      In reply to this we pointed outthat on their own showing the irmiieJdiate losses in presentcircumstances were not likely to be so significant in factas compared with the time when (we might hope)  trade became more normal, (without quantitative restrictions and otherbarriers)&quot; and further that this would represent an obligation on our part to continue a process after the initialtariff obligation period of three years had expired.12, , Clayton said that a refusal on our part to meet themfurther would be a great disappointment to him and to theUnited States people and that he could not go back to Washingtonwith so little in his pocket as regards preferences with any confidence that our requirements in other fields would bemet. - He begged us to consider very carefully the implications-tions and to study the short list of essential demands whichhe had ready. - This it was explained fell into a number of parts;  eliminations, further reductions,  reductions where we had refused hitherto to meet them, and it would be foundthat there was also a list of requests withdrawn as compared .with the original list.13.    After a suggestion by the President that, if theyreally felt that there was unbalance in our present offersas compared with theirs, it was always open to them to withdrawpart of their offers (which the United States representativesaid would not be a satisfactory solution for them), themeeting ended with an undertaking carefully to study the revised United States demands but with little encouragement to the United States representatives that we should be ableto meet them.

It was reported at the meeting ofMinisters on 8th August that this distinction had now been dropped.    This decision has been upheld by the Conference infull Commission.(ii) . Prior Approval before March 19 52:   The agreed textprovides that prior approval of the right of individual countries to discriminate shall not be required before march 1952.(iii)    Prior Approval after March 1952;   The text providesthat prior approval after that date shall relate only togeneral policy and not to individual transactions.(iv)    General Review of the World Balance of payments position:    It is now provided that s&quot;uch a general review,which would have the object of determining whether a fundamental disequilibrium existed in the.world balance ofpayments,, should not take place until five years after thedate on which the International Monetary Fund began operations,i.e, March 1952.    It would be possible, if there were a radical change- in the world position, to hold a general review by agreement at an earlier date, but this is clearly most improbable.    If such a review, when undertaken, led to agreement that no severe disequilibrium existed, all countries would be called upon to drop discriminatory practices.    this in fact would be no danger to our individual freedom in the&apos;next few years, since it is highly unlikely that thefundamental disequilibrium in the world balance of payments will have ended before 1952, and even more unlikely that thenations, including ourselves, other Commonwealth countries,fellow-discriminators and beneficiaries of discrimination,would show a majority in favour of ending the- right todsicriminate.    If in fact the disequilibrium had ended, then it, would, be in our interest as the major trading nation to end the right of all countries to discriminate.(v)    Discriminatory rights in the immediate future:-So far as the General Agreement is concerned, the Americans have,not withdrawn the suggestion that we should have complete freedom during 19.1+8 or until a Marshall Plan is effective.A similar solution has been suggested in discussions betweenthe Americans and the French.

Proposals for consideration by an International Conference on Trade andEmployment. (December 6th, 1945*) (Cmd.6709)Section E.   Tariffs and Preferences.1.     Import tariffs and preferences.     In the light of the principles setforth in Article VII of the mutual-aid agreements, members should enter into arrangements for the substantial reduction of tariffs andfor the elimination of tariff preferences, action for the elimination of tariff preferences being taken in conjunction with adequate measures for the substantial reduction of barriers to world trade, as part of the mutually advantageous arrangementscontemplated in&apos; this document.As an initial step in the process of eliminating tariff preferences it should be agreed that:a.     Existing international commitments will not be permitted to stand in the way of action agreed upon with respect to/tariff...The Atlantic Charter.
tariff preferences.b. All negotiated reductions in nost-favored-nation tariffs will operate automatically to reduce or eliminate margins ofpreference *c. Margins of. preference on any product will in no case beincreased and no new preferences will be introduced.4-*     Statement by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on December6th, 1945.There is one particular matter arising out of the terras ofArticle VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement which-is- of especial interest and importance to -the British Commonwealth and Empire - that is the questionof tariff preferences.     I would therefore refer shortly to that aspect of the iunerican document which deals with both tariffs and tariff preferences.(a)The statementv &apos; sets forth the procedure to be followed by commonconsent in considering, in the context of a general lowering of tariffs and other trade barriers, what contribution can be made from our side byway of reduction or elimination of preferences.The statement makes it clear that, in pursuit of the objectives ofArticle VII of the. Mutual Aid Agreement, we for our part are ready toagree that the existing system of preferences within the BritishCommonwealth and the Empire will he contracted, provided there is adequate compensation in the form of improvement in trading conditionsbetween Commonwealth and Empire countries and the rest of the world.The statement further provides that in entering negotiations forthe reduction of tariffs the parties concerned will not refuse todiscuss the modification of particular preferences on the ground thatthese are the subject of prior commitments;   on the contrary, allmargins of preference will be regarded as open to negotiation, and itwill of course be for the party negotiating the modification of anymargin of preference which it is bound by an existing commitment to givea. third partyj to obtain the consent of the third party concerned.Further points to be noted are:-(i) The statement makes it clear there is ho commitment on any. country in advance of negotiations to.reduce or eliminate anyparticular margin of preference.     The position is that each countryremains free to judge in the light of the offers made by all the others, the extent of the contribution it can make towards the realisation of the agreed objectives.(ii) It is recognised that reduction or elimination of preferences can only be considered in relation to and in return for reductions of tariffs and other barriers to world trade in generalwhich would make for mutually advantageous arrangements for theexpansion of trade.     There is thus no question of any unilateralsurrender of preferences.     There must be adequate compensation forall parties affected.The statement does not in advance of the detailed negotiations lay down how far the process of reduction and elimination of preferenceswill be carried at this immediate stage.     It must be realised that somepreferences are of particular importance to the economy of certain partsof the world just as some tariffs are important in others.     the elimination of all preferences would be such a step as would require amost substantial and widespread reduction of tariffs and other trade/barriersSee 3. above
barriers lay a large number of countries.     Thus it is recognised that the. degree to which the final objectives can be reached at the initialstage can only appear at the negotiations themselves and as the result.of a. mutually advantageous settlement.Extract fromStatement by the President of the Board of Trade in the House ofCommons on March 24th, 1947 *I was just saying that we shall certainly not give away interestsof other Commonwealth countries in reducing preferences enjoyed by them&quot;in the United Kingdom markets,, and we are equally sure that we can count on them to treat us in the same way, and not to give away preferences -which we value in their markets.     Whatever is given up, will have to be part of a mutually satisfactory bargain.     That is the whole basic ideaof the negotiation on the tariff side on which we are going to proceed at Geneva.     That is also the basis of these prepartvtory conversations which are now going forward amongst the countries of the commonwealth and Empire in London.     We, of course, recognise very well in thisrelation that some industries, including agriculture particularly,perhaps have been developed in Empire countries on the basis of markets \assured by preferential arrangement.     We do not want suddenly, tomodify these preferences to an extent that is going to cause realdisruption and distress in the overseas countries concerned.     In thelong-term, we can, I think, avoid any such results by the successfulimplementation of the whole of the terms of the proposed trade charter.In the short term, the consultations that are now going on between representatives of the Ccram.onwea.lth countries should make all parties,including ourselves, fully aware of the dangers of sudden action of that kind and should, therefore, enable us to avoid them.
ANNEX &apos;F&apos;    &apos;COMPARISON OF U.S.A. AND U.K. DIRECT TARIFF OFFERS.1.     What the U.S.A. have.offered to us, in summary figures,is to hind their duties on U.K.  trade valued in 1939. at 8,083,000 and to reduce duties on U.K. trade valued in thatyear at  17,000,000.      (These figures have been taken fromcalculations by the U.S.AC team.     The values are f.o.b. andhave been converted at 1+.1+6 dollars ^  1.)     The essentialquestion is whether or not our offers measure up adequatelyto these two fundamental figures.2.     We have offered to bind our duties (or duty-free entry)at the U.S.A. request on U.S.A. trade valued (c.i.f.) in 1938.at  1+1,1+1+8,000 and to reduce duties on imports valued in thatyear  8,1+21,000.      These figures show a surplus under the&apos;binding&apos; head, but a deficiency under the &apos;reduction&apos; head.However, Mr. Clayton argued, when he saw the President thatwe ought not to claim credit for binding the tariff on essential raw materials, such as cotton, softwood, and wheat,where - there is no practical chance that we should ever T/ishto raise the duty.      We can deduct  22,321,000 in respect ofsuch items and take no credit whatever for these bindings(though the U.S.A. was sufficiently interested to ask forthem).      The resultant bindings are then  19,127,000 and reductions  8,1+21,000.3.      It. has been recognised from the start (and explicitlyprescribed in the Procedural Memorandum agreed at the-first session of the Preparatory Committee last autumn) that thebinding of a low rate of duty is equivalent to the reductionof a high rate.     If we weight the case against ourselves byreckoning any duty over 10 per cent ad valorem as outsidethe range of &quot;low&quot; duties for this purpose, we may stillclaim as much as  9,032,000s under our binding head (after deducting the bindings on essential raw materials) as equivalent to the reduction of high duties and transferthis figure to our reduction credit.     The figures then read:   bindings total  10,095,000 and reductions total 17,1+53,000.     Both these&apos; figures are in excess of thecorresponding U.S.A. figures, of  8,083,000 and  1/,000,000respectively.It. must however be pointed out that the Americans by using other methods of calculation principally based onthe percentage of items reduced or eliminated purport toshow that they have.gone much further in the reduction ofbarriers than we have.x       We have in fact also bound a number of low specificduties for which we have taken no credit in this connection;the value of the &quot;trade is  3,182,000, but it consistssubstantially of Ottawa duties where the U.S.A. are primarily interested in the reduction of preference, andI think we might overstate our case if we credited thesebindings as equivalent to the reduction of high duties.
ANNEX *G&apos;(a) RubberPre-war imports of natural rubber into the U.S.A.amounted to  27..3 million from all sources of which  17.million came from the Colonial Empire.     During the warthe American,synthetic rubber industry made great stridesand in order to preserve this industry when natural rubberagain became available the U.S. continued to operate asystem by which users of rubber were required to mix acertain proportion of synthetic with natural.     Theproportion varies from product to product but is graduallybeing scaled down.      It will shortly be reduced to 33h%(the target figure of the Batt report).     Under the termsof the draft Charter these &quot;mixing regulations&quot; are tobe subject to negotiation in the same way as tariffs.    Itis not to bo expected that the Americans will agree to eliminate this mixing regulation in view of the strategic importance of the synthetic rubber industry (although theState Department and the manufacturing interests might bemore sympathetic towards a figure lower than the targetat which the Service Departments are aiming).      We shouldnot therefore press for elimination but a reduction of the overall requirement to 20% would be reasonable and would represent a substantial concession in view of the very high figures of rubber consumption in America.(b) Vegetable Oils.Since 193h the United States have imposed a processingtax on certain vegetable oils which are not produced inthe U.S.A. but exports of which were of great importanceto certain parts of the Colonial Empire.     The effect ofthis tax was to give additional protection to various oils and fats of U.S, manufacture which were more or lesscompetitive.     Cocoanut oil imported from the Philippinesenjoyed a preferential rate of tax.     We might in this case seek repeal of the processing taxes (which would,in the case of cocoanut oil, involve the elimination ofa preference accorded by the U.S. to the Philippines and,in the case of all the oils concerned, remove an obstacle to the resumption of Colonial exports to the U.S.A. whensupplies become more normal).      This, however, would represent a rather large concession in relation to what we are proposing to do in return and might provoke the americans to revive some of the requests on us in other directions which they have now withdrawn.     We should therefore endeavour to ask for a concession which we candefend as a reasonable balance for the further concessionsof our own preferences which are summarised in the main body of this paper.
ANNEX &apos;H&apos;CUSTOMS &quot;ADMINISTRATION.&apos;In order to ratify the draft Charter, many countries(including the U.S.A. hut not including the&apos; U.K.) willhave to introduce certain desirable reforms into theircustoms administration and remove practices which are ineffect as much of a harrier to imports as their ordinarytariffs.In the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade&quot;^(bywhich the concessions on actual tariff rates will he putinto effect) countries will not he required to legislatethough -they will he required not to change their customsadministration to the detriment of imports.     It wouldhe possible, therefore, to postpone the coming intoeffect of certain of our preference concessions untilthe ratification of the Charter, on the grounds that it-is only when these reforms in customs administrationhave been made that the full effect of the concessionsobtained in return will be felt.     Alternatively if any country desired such of our tariff concessions as wehave, reserved, for the time being to bo put into effect at once, it could introduce the necessary legislation.
