IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S EC RET   -CP.(47)  236 COPY NO._1022ND AUGUST t11947      -CABINETBALANCE OF PAYMENTS:HOUSINGNote by the Secretary of the Cabinet1.     I was instructed to arrange for memoranda to be prepared,for consideration by the Cabinet on 25th August, on the tentative suggestions for further adjustments in the national economy which were put forward at the meeting of Ministers on20th August.     Two of those affected the Health Departments:--(a) That, save in mining and agricultural areas,there might be a temporary stoppage of workon new houses until the number of houses under construction had fallen to 150,000; and(b) That some restrictions might be imposed on theoccupation of more than one residence.In the absence of the two Ministers concerned, Icirculate, for information, the following comments which Ihave obtained from the Ministry of Health on these twosuggestions.2.     New Houses,In pursuance of the decision taken at the Lord President&apos; sCommittee on 12th August, 1947 (L.P.(47) 25th Meeting, Minute 6),approval of tenders for the erection of further houses hasalready been restricted to the construction of houses in ruraland mining areas.Local authorities who submit tenders before the review ofthe building programme has been completed will be informedthat consideration of the tenders will be deferred pendingthis review.     There may, however, be a few cases which call for exceptional treatment in the interim.The scale and distribution of new tenders will have tobe considered subsequently in the light of the decisions ofMinisters on the Building Programme (including the housing programme).
3*     Use of Existing Housing Accommodation.&apos; It is understood that the suggestion of imposingrestrictions on the occupation of more than one residencewas put forward with the object of making more accommodation available for agricultural workers in rural areas and forfactory workers in urban areas.The appropriate procedure for this purpose is for local authorities to have recourse in suitable cases tothe existing requisitioning powers.     These powers havealready been used in a number of such cases;   butcircumstances vary so widely (e.g. the extent of theowner&apos;s use of the premises and their suitability for occupation by agricultural or factory workers) that action can only be taken on the merits of particular cases.(Signed)    NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S.W.I..22ND AUGUST, 19h7
