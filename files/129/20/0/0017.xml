THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF   HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1947139-       SECRET Copy No.   0CP. (47) 21728th July, 1947CABINETCAPITAL punishment memorandum by the Home secretary at their meeting on 15th July (C.M. (47) 61st Conclusions, Minute 2), theCabinet invited me to ascertain whether it would be possible to. draft the title ofthe Criminal Justice Bill in such a way as to exclude any amendment for theabolition.of capital punishment and to circulate a memorandum on the sugges-tion that it might be possible to distinguish between certain types of murderfor which capital punishment would be retained and other types for which itwould be abolished. &apos;Title of the Criminal Justice bill. The long title of a Bill is a summary description of the contents of theBill, and as such gives guidance towards a decision on the question whether an amendment is or is not within the scope of the Bill. If, however, an amendment,although not within the terms of the title, is within the scope of the Bill, suchan amendment is in order, and if it is carried, the title can be amended to cover it.3. Accordingly, even if the title of the Criminal Justice Bill could be drafted in terms not covering the subject of Capital Punishment, an amendmenton this subject would nevertheless be in order, unless such amendment were held to be outside the scope of the Bill.4. The general purpose of the Bill is to amend the law relating to thevarious methods of treating offenders. For this purpose the Bill amends the law relating to penal servitude, to imprisonment, to fines, to probation, and to corporal punishment. It also-as at present drafted contains a clause making a small but desirable amendment in those provisions of the Children and Young persons act which provide that the sentence of death shall not be passed on persons underthe age of 18. But even if this clause were omitted, I do not see on what groundsit could be argued&apos;that an amendment on the subject of Capital Punishment is outside the scope of a comprehensive Bill amending the law relating to themethods by which the courts are empowered to deal with offenders.5.,, An amendment on the subject of Capital Punishment was proposed onthe Criminal Justice Bill of 1939. No suggestion was then made that theamendment was out of order.The Grading of Murders6. The first question which arises in this connection is whether the death sentence could properly be confined to premeditated murders. Apart from thedifficulty of defining what is meant by &quot; premeditated &quot; the following points mustbe considered :-(a) Some of the murders for which the death sentence is most obviouslyinappropriate are premeditated. For example, so-called &quot;mercymurders,&quot; where the victim is an imbecile or a hopeless invalid andthe object of the crime is to spare the victim a life of misery, murders33991
by mothers of young children in pitiful circumstances not covered bythe Infanticide Act: suicide pacts where an elderly couple in dis-tressed circumstances agree to die together and one survives.(b) Amongst the worst murders are some which are unpremeditated, such,for example, as murders committed in connection with rape, ormurders by criminals who are interrupted in some felonious enterprise and use violence without premeditation but with a reckless disregard of the consequences to human life.(c) There are many murders where the killing is clearly intentional, unlawfuland unaccompanied by any mitigating circumstances, but there is no evidence either to prove or to disprove premeditation; in cases, forexample, where a man kills a woman who has left him or is seeking tobreak with him, there may frequently be no evidence to showwhether the crime was the result of a sudden brain storm or had been thought about beforehand.7. The Eoyal Commission of 1846 recommended that the death penaltyshould be confined to (a) murders deliberately committed with express malice aforethought, and(6) murders committed in, or with a view to, the perpetration, or escapeafter the perpetration, or attempt at perpetration of any of thefollowing felonies : murder, arson, rape, burglary, robbery or piracy.Many attempts were made in the next twenty years to amend the law for thepurposes loosely and imperfectly indicated in these recommendations,, but none of these attempts were successful, and in 1886 Sir William Harcourt,&apos; who hadbeen Home Secretary for five years, said that &quot; when he set to work he thought there would be little difficulty in drawing definitions, but after consultation with sir George Grey and some of the most eminent judges he gave up the attempt.&quot;8. In more recent years attention has principally been directed to the-desirability of relieving the Judges from the necessity of imposing death sentencesin cases which stir public compassion and in which reprieve will obviously follow.The number of such cases has been reduced by the Infanticide Act of 1922, which,as amended in 1938, covers all cases where a woman causes the death of her child&quot; being a child under the age of twelve months .... but at the time the balanceof her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from theeffect Of giving birth to the child or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child.&quot;9. There are still, however, pitiful cases where sentences of death have tobe passed although they will obviously not be carried out, and. in 1936 whenLord Simon was Home Secretary he gave much thought to this problem, but came to the conclusion that he could not propose any appropriate amendment of the law.10. There is no possible method of defining by law the cases in which the motive for taking human life is sufficiently excusable to warrant treating them asa distinct class. The cases shade off by degrees from that of a fond parent killingan imbecile child to that of a fanatic committing a political assassination for what he may regard as a service to humanity, or from that of an elderly coupleagreeing to die together to that of a man who induces a young girl pregnant byhim to commit suicide and himself makes a doubtful and half-hearted attempt.11. The difficulty of defining by any statutory provision the types of murderwhich ought to be excluded from the death penalty can be illustrated by reviewingsome of the considerations which have to be taken into account by the HomeSecretary in deciding whether to recommend clemency. Amongst those considera-tions are the following : -(a) The degree of provocation. Many murderers have been reprieved becausethe provocation which they received, though not sufficient to rebut a charge of murder, was regarded as sufficient to justify clemency. Atypical instance is that of a man who murders a wife, who has beenunfaithful to him over a period of many years and has inflicted greatmental torment on him.(b) The state of the murderer&apos;s mind.   There have been cases where amurderer has been reprieved because his mental capacity, though not so low as to amount to legal imbecility or insanity, is such that hecould not be regarded as being fully aware of the enormity of hiscrime
(c) The murderer&apos;s age. A murderer under the age of 18 cannot be sentenced to death, but jnany murderers over this age have been reprieved on grounds of youth.(d) The effect on public opinion.   An instance of this is the recent case ofLey and Smith where Ley, the principal in the murder, was foundto be insane, and I decided to recommend a reprieve in the case ofSmith, who acted on Ley&apos;s instruction, on the grounds that publicopinion would not tolerate the execution of the agent when the death penalty could not, by law, be imposed on the principal.(e) The degree of responsibility.  In cases of murder by two or more persons,it may be right that the principal should be executed and the secondarypartners reprieved. - 1(/) The certainty of the evidence. It is the practice to recommend a reprievein any case in which there is the slightest doubt of the murderer&apos;sguilt.12. If it be recognised that any attempt to grade murders by statutory provisions would be fruitless, the question remains whether there would be any advantage in giving either (a) the Judge, or (b) the Jury a discretion to decideafter there has been a conviction of murder whether the sentence should be deathor some other penalty.13. The Judges would, I believe, object to any proposal to place such a responsibility on them. This question was considered in 1940 in connection withthe Bill for .the Treachery Act, and it was decided that in cases of convictionunder that Act no discretion should be left to the court to pass any sentence otherthan death. If in murder cases the decision rested with individual Judges, aconsiderable degree of disparity between their decisions would be inevitable.14. Moreover, the decision of the Home Secretary to recommend a reprieveis sometimes based on facts and considerations which are-not before the court,either because they are not relevant to the issue of guilt which the court has to-decide or because they come to light after the sentence has been passed. Powerto use the Prerogative in such cases would have to be retained, but if a judge in the exercise of a discretion had decided to impose the death sentence and theHome Secretary subsequently recommended a reprieve, the consequences wouldbe embarrassing for both the Home Secretary and the Judge. Frequently, thereasons for which the Home Secretary grants a reprieve cannot be publiclystated, and the inference drawn by the public would be that the Judge and theHome Secretary had taken contrary views on the same facts.15. From the evidence given to the Select Committee of 1930 as regards theposition in the United States of America, it appears that in most of those states which have retained the death penalty, discretion is given to the Jury to decide whether the crime is murder of the first degree, for which the penalty is death,or murder of the second degree, for which the penalty is imprisonment. Thefundamental principle, however, of our law is that the Jury has only the function of determining the question of guilt or innocence, and is relieved of any respon-.sibility for the consequent penalty. As the Select Committee of 1930 pointed-out in their Report, &quot; the evidence before the court is restricted to what is directly relative to the proof of the charge and excludes many weighty considera-tions that are thrown into the balance when the Home Secretary is advising onthe Prerogative of Mercy.&quot; The Committee said grading by the Jury &quot;would lead to great inequality of judgment and administration.&quot;16. There is the further consideration that if after a Jury had deliberatelydecided that a person ought to be put to death, the Home Secretary should never-theless find it his duty to recommend Clemency, there would appear to be a conflict between the Crown and the Jury.17. While there are obvious objections to a law that prescribes only onepenalty for the different types of murder, it has two advantages. First, theresponsibility for a death sentence falls on the law as representing the collectivewill of the community, and not on any individual or group of individuals. TheJury are told that they have only to consider whether the charge is proved andhave no responsibility for the sentence. If the Jury return a verdict of murder,the Judge has no option. And the responsibility of the Home Secretary onerousas it is-is limited to consideration of the question whether there are reasons tojustify interference with the due course of law. Secondly, the existing system-enables a far more consistent standard to be maintained as regards the execution
of the death sentence than would be possible under any other system. For other offences than murder, sentences vary in comparable cases not only because different,Judges are liable to have somewhat different standards, but because no Judge hassuch facilities as are available to the Home Secretary of comparing one case with another. So long as the question of a reprieve rests with the Home Secretary a.high degree of standardisation is possible because the Home Office keeps elaboraterecords, has time to compare each new case with any comparable case which hasoccurred not only in recent years but perhaps ten or twenty years ago, and isable to bring to the notice of each Home Secretary the considerations which haveguided his predecessors in analogous circumstances.18. The Select Committee of 1930 dealt in paragraphs 162-182 of theiiReport with the question of grading, and said : &apos;&apos; The weight of evidence tendered to our Committee was certainly against the bringing in of this system.&quot; While:I share the general desire that some method should be devised of avoiding thepassing of a death sentence in cases where such a sentence is clearly inappropriate,I, like my predecessors, have been unable to find any satisfactory method of amending the existing law.19.   It must also be remembered that a proposal to limit the death penaltyto certain types of murder would not be acceptable to those who are in favour ofthe abolition of capital punishment.    Mr. Roy Calvert, when giving evidence before the Select Committee on behalf of the National Council for the Abolition.of the Death Penalty, said : &quot; My objection to the grading of murder is not that it is impossible to-frame definitions, but that as a matter of fact it would lead to reel injustice.&apos;-J.
