(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE- PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).&apos; S E C R E TC.P.(U7)  202lhTH JULY. 19ii7CABINET-NATIONAL WAGES policy memorandum by tus Lord President of the CouncilIn connection with the memoranda submitted by the Ministerof&apos; Fuel and Power (cp(47) 189) and the Minister of Labourand National Service (C.P.(i(.7) 190 and 195) 9 it may be helpful to the Cabinet&quot;if I review briefly the stage reached as aresult of previous Ministerial discussions. ^ .2.     &quot;Wages Policy&quot; is invoiced chiefly as a remedy for threecurrent troubles;-(i) the tendency for wages generally to riserelatively unchecked owing to the current .pressure of inflationary forces and the strong position of the workers in full employment;.(ii) the problem of securing relative rates ofwages and earnings which will assist inmanning-up the under^nnod. Industries :and-in restraining drafts on man-power by fully manned or less essential industries;    and.(iii) the problem of securing a wage structurerelated to output and capable of stimulating the utmost productivity^3.     The problem ci resisting inflationary trends is of great and indeed- critical importancee   When it comes to mandatoryaction this must largely be dealt with as a matter of fiscaland general economic policy,   but there is none the less much that can be done in the sphere of education and publicity tobring the facts before the attention of all concerned in wagesand hours claims0   There is a real need for courageousleadership and exposition by Ministers generally; an&amp; by TradeUnion leaders tgenerally in connection with the dangers of thespiral drift which has taken place in regard to wages and hoursclaims and concessions,,    (Hours are? of. course, no less important than wagese    Indeed, in some respects it is moreimportant at the present moment to prevent decreases of hoursthan increases in wages),   in my opinion, as a Government weare at fault in that&quot; we have not had enough of such leadership.Socialisation ? Yes.    Control of investment and private industry? Yes.   But when it comes to wages and hours - which, at-anyrate, for- a material period are bound to have serious reper-cussions on the whole economy through their effect on costs and prices and, incidental:y^    even perhaps most of all,COPY NO.1/
8on the manning of the basic undermanned industries, to whichI refer below - there appears to he a wish in some Trade Unionquarters and even among some Ministers to adopt a laissez faireattitude and to assert that everything will quickly comeright in the wash of industrial adaptation.I4.,     Yet, if an economic smash comes, it will he the GovernmentI that will he &quot;blamed - from all quarters - and it will deserveto he &quot;blamed, if Ministers generally fail in the courage tohold aloft the torch of economic fact and truth.    Can we goon attacking the Manchester School of thought when we arguewith the Opposition and private industry, and at the same timeadopt a Manchester School attitude where our own friends andour own &quot;interests&quot; are concerned?    In all these matters,Socialists should apply only one test - the public interest,which in the not very long run is also the interest of theworkers.   As I said in my Margate speech (which was approvedby the Prime Minister and well received by the delegates), west and for the worker&apos;s right to his full share of production,but we are in danger of overdrawing on our overdrafts.   the reception of this speech at Margate, my contacts with theParliamentary Labour Party and my experience at public meetingsconvince me that the workers are ready to face the facts if our trade Union colleagues and ourselves are ready to state themcourageously and fully.   The workers must be persuaded toabandon the mentality of nineteenth century capitalism, torealise the social consequences of the blessings of full employment, and to recognise that in our fairly advanced stage of transition to a new social ^rder, the first economic dutyof each man and woman is to the nation as, a whole,5.     What I have said in paragraph 3 about the problem of   ^inflation also applies to some extent to the question of usingwages as an instrument for securing correct distribution ofman-power.    On this, however, there is reason to believe that wages policy can make a significant contribution and here the questions arise:(i) How far do any wage differentials which are practicable in fact influence man-powerdistribution?(ii) How far are existing methods;.failing to securethe necessary readjustments?    and(iii) What practicable and acceptable further measures can be devised?6,      It is with this aspect that I suggest the Cabinet shouldconcern itself at this stage.    The question of an incentivestructure of wages, although of very great importance, raisesdistinct issues which should be considered separately7.     I annex a paper prepared in consultation with the EconomicSection of the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Labourshowing the recent trends which are relevant.    The following comments may be made at this stage:-(i)   So far as minimum weekly wages are concerned, labour in the undermanned industries is in some cases paid morethan labour in similar occupational conditions in otherindustries which compete with the undermanned industries for-        labour^supply (paragraph 2 and Tables 3 and k of Annex),   Thiswage differential is not, however, very great and is probablyinsufficient to compensate for the unpleasant character of thework.    It is unlikely, therefore, to be a sufficient inducement to overcome the reluctance of a worker to leave his existingemployment and enter one of the undermanned industries.
,9(ii)    In agriculture, the prospective increase of theagricultural minimum wage to 90 shillings per week will still leave the.agricultural labourer with a lower wage thanthat paid to railway porters in the neighbouring towns,whose work is less skilled and less arduous.(iii)    In textiles, the rise of women&apos;s hourly earnings in the cotton industry as compared with pre-war is less thanthe corresponding rise in women&apos;s hourly earnings in general engineering, which is the principal competing industry forwomen&apos;i5 labour in Lancashire.(Iv)    The greatest relative gain in earnings in anundermanned industry has been in coal mining.    It is significant that in this industry the approach to the 1947labour target is closer than in most other undermannedindustries.8.     It appears to be common ground that all concerned inthe settlement of wages and conditions of labour should beas fully aware as possible of the national need for checkinginflation and for manning up essential undermanned industries.The Minister of Fuel and Power argues in CP.(47)189,paragraphs 7-9 that legislation should be promoted to establish a new body - a Central Advisory Council - to pass judgment on any wage claims in the first place before negotiationstook place.    The Minister of Labour in CP. (47) 190 arguesin favour of retaining broadly the present machinery withcertain    secondary modifications.9.      I find myself in sympathy both with the Minister ofLabour&apos;s reluctance to make an abrupt and possibly perilousdeparture from the established structure of industrialnegotiations and with the Minister of Fuel and Power&apos;sargument for a much more vigorous and effective injection ofnational economic policy into wages settlements.   There are good arguments on both; sides, and I am anxious that we,shall adopt a policy which makes, the best of both cases.I.accordingly put forward the following proposals as adefinite step forward in the right direction, on the under-standing in any event that we shall keep a careful wa^ichon the way things work out and shall not hesitate to-^takestronger action if necessary.10*    I suggest that:-(i)    the Cabinet should accept the proposals of theMinister of Labour in paragraph 20 of CF*(47)190.(ii)    the Minister of Labour should be invited to setup in his own Department a Section on Wages and Hours policy to keep track, on behalf of the Government, of all claimsaffecting wages, hours, and working conditions and report tohim promptly the effects, if any, which each application is ,likely to have on the amount of man-power required, on thecharges   made to the public by the industry or service, on national subsidies if any, and on similar claims put forwardor likely to be put forward by other industries;
io(iii)    the Minister of Labour should be invited to circulatereports on each such claim to all interested Ministers, these reports wherever necessary being brought before the lord president&apos;s Committee;(iv)    the Minister of Labour should find his own meansof seeing that tribunals,  courts, wages councils, or other bodies concerned are suitably informed on the   national interests as disclosed by the reports above proposed;(v)    the Minister of Labour should be invited tokeep up a progressing system of all wage claims and to ensurewhere necessary, in consultation with other Ministers concerned,that suitable representations are made where the handling of claims appears to be unduly dilatory;(vi)    I should make arrangements for the CentralEconomic planning Staff and for the Economic Section to keepin close touch with the proposed Wages policy Section ofthe Ministry of Labour and in that way to keep the Ministerfully informed of the relationship between wages policyconsiderations and the working out of economic policy andeconomic planning targetso11.    As I have said above, however,  the situation calls for more drastic action, and wages and hours policy cannot beconsidered in isolation from other urgent economic questions on which we shall also have to decide.     The administrative measures I have proposed should help, not least in keepingus in closer touch with developments affecting hours and wages, but they will achieve little unless they areaccompanied by the change of attitude at all levels to whichI have referred.     As the Minister responsible for general economic information policy, I shall do my utmost tofacilitate this change of attitude through publicity methods,but the.se will be quite inadequate without the right leader-ship from Ministers and in the Trade Union movement.    If mycolleagues agree with my views on the subject I am sure,however, that their full co-operation will be forthcomingto this end.(Intld)      H.M.Office of the Lord president of the Councilof the council, S.W.1.llflJH JULY, 19Kim

The following figures only give ageneral outline of the position, and too much significance mustnot be attached to small differences in the wages given.Table 3 compares the minimum rates of wages for menprevailing in some of the under-manned industries, and incertain other occupations.    It is seen that,whilst markedadvances have been made in the wages of some of the under-manned industries, the resulting wage differential in their favour (relative to certain other occupations) is not - so faras minimum weekly wages are concerned - very great.

The foregoing figures of minimum wages in differentoccupations need to he amplified.    Tables 5 and 6 providea record of the advances which have been made in averagewage earnings per hour in different Industries (or average earnings per man shift in the case of coalmining.)

15l+o     The &quot;evidence of &quot;average earnings&quot; figures on the comparative wage attractions of different industries must always he treated with considerable researve, owing to a variety of statistical subtleties which often made them verymisleading.    As far as they go, however, the hourly earningsfor July 19h7 suggest that at. the end of the War coal had advanced its relative wage position very considerably,&apos;and cotton slightly - but that the wage levels of the otherundermanned industries had lagged severely behind.   However, byQiCtober 1945, the figures would make it appear thatironfounding and the gas industry had regained their pre-warrelativity, and brickr-malcing (eta.)   had advanced on it., whilsttinplate and steel sheet, and laundries, were still lagging.
