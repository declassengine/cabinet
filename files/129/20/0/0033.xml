memorandum. A delegation of officials of the Treasury, ForeignOffice, Board of Trade and the Bank of England, led bySir Wilfred Eady, left for Washington on Saturday, 16thAugust.      The instructions settled for Sir Wilfred Eady bythe Ministers in charge of the Departments concerned were asfollows:-Sir Wilfred was to tell the Americans that whenthe Loan ran out in October, we should find ourselves in an untenable position In respect of our foreignobligations, not only to the United States but to othercountries as well, if nothing were done.     He had therefore come, not to challenge philosophies norformally to raise Article 12 of. the Loan Agreement,but to explore the possibility of some immediaterelaxations which would enable us to avoid taking more drastic action.     Unless such relaxations could be made,world trade would be retarded and the drain on Americanfinance increased.On convertibility, Sir Wilfred was to say. that, we wanted to maintain it and it was in our own and theUnited States&apos; interest that we should do so.     Butif this was to be done, it was essential that thereshould be a limit on the demands for dollars which other countries put on the U.K.     Without asking for formal abrogation of the convertibility clause, we wan tedto be in a position to reduce the dollar drain on thatcountry, arising out of our convertibility obligations,by ad hoc negotiations with each of the countries concerned.     These negotiations would also involve someelasticity in the interpretation of our non-discriminationobligations on e.g. the lines under discussion in Geneva.. . .. The first step would be to see whether the americans would agree that we should go ahead on theselines without any formal action on their part.     Theymight, however, insist on formal consultation underArticle 12 of the Loan Agreement, which refers to&quot;modifications for presentation to the respectivelegislatures&quot;.     But there was some reason to think thatwhen Congress is not sitting, the President has powerto act in a case such as the present.2* Since these instructions were settled, only a fewdays ago, the dollar drain has accelerated.     In the last six weeks it averaged $115 millions a week, compared with $77millions a week in the second quarter.      In the last fiveworking days $175 millions has been lost.     Further particularsare given in Annex I.3* The accelerated movement shows that the position asregards foreign holders is getting out of control.      They areexercising very great ingenuity in transferring sterling intodollars or dollar goods even in anticipation of subsequent needs.It is only prudent judging by past experience to expect thisacceleration to continue;    in which event the rest of the Creditwill&quot; be rapidly exhaus-ted and the country will have very little to show for it.
k* The Treasury and the Bank therefore consider that immediate and drastic action is imperative.      The necessary orders are being prepared, and if Ministers agree could be putinto force at the shortest notice.5* The first step in any practical action is to limit the convertibility of sterling.     A technical note is attached(Annex II).     The effect of the proposal is to allow&quot;convertibility for any country only up to the amount&apos;of a rationfixed by ourselves.     This would be applied to all non-sterling-area countries;    the appropriate treatment for the sterling area is different in character, and will take more time to prepare,because it is most desirable to carry the area controls with us,rather than to take unilateral action against them.     They would,at once be asked to exercise the utmost restraint&apos; in their&apos;dollar expenditure;    and behind such a request lies theprotection that London banks would immediately cease to giveeffect to exchange transactions approved by area controls ifthe Bank of-England notice which at present authorises suchtransactions were to be withdrawn.     This request would befollowed In due course by consultations over dollar rations.6. This involves breach of the Anglo-American financial agreement and of the payments agreements which we have signed.&quot;&apos;&apos;But it is the only way of checking the present drain which is far greater than anything that could possibly be attributed tothe normal flow of current transactions.7* It is proposed that at the opening of his discussions in Washington on Monday morning (Monday afternoon, British time).Sir Wilfred Eady should explain what we are proposing to do and why.      It would be extremely valuable to carry the Americanswith us in this and a public statement of their agreement would greatly strengthen our position.     Moreover, if we. acted without consultation with the U.S. Government we should increase the risk that they would stop us from drawing the remaining $850 millions of the Credit.     We propose, therefore, that the new order shouldnot be made&apos; until Sir Wilfred Eady has been able to ascertain the American reaction.      It would also be necessary to informthe Canadian Government, to whom we have similar obligations and who will in addition he seriously affected hy our action.8, The immediate effect of the action proposed will be felt world-wide;    countries which have ordered goods from U.S.A.in the expectation of being able to pay for them in dollarsacquired from us may be unable to pay for them;    the shock totrading operations of all kinds will be considerable.     On theother hand, there is a general expectation that something ofthis kind may happen, and it would of course have been necessaryin any case in a few weeks&apos; time when the Credit was exhausted.9* Our action is hound to be a shock to the paris conference, and there is some danger that leading representatives will be recalled for consultation, and that the shock toconfidence will impair the coherence of the Conference.     Thiswould risk delaying the final report.      On the other hand,  our action would clearly indicate the critical development of theworld dollar crisis, and would underline to the Conference boththe key position of the ILK.  and the urgency of agreeing an effective report as&apos; the only means in sight of securing dollaraid.     in any event, we could avoid this difficulty only bypostponing action for two or three weeks,  and the situation doesnot permit this delay.
10. There is a danger that some of our suppliers willretaliate, insisting on being paid in gold or dollars in advance.We expect difficulty from Argentina (who have taken J&amp;5k millions from us in the last six weeks).     There may be some interruption of supplies, and we may have to do some quick negotiation. *11. We should have to fix dollar rations arbitrarily tocover the, next few weeks;   the next step must be to negotiatepayments agreements and make definite plans to secure our supplies for the next few months.     This will involve hard bargaining allover the world, in which our negotiators will have only alimited amount of money to spend, and will have to buy as muchas they can with it.     We shall have cards In our hand.     But itwill be impossible to play them unless we are prepared to facesubstantial loss of supplies which have in the past eight years been regarded as essential.     This will involve curtailment ofthe import programme and some cut in rations.12*   -        In essence, what is now proposed is based on the same principles as the instructions already approved by Ministers for sir Wilfred Eady.     But it is more drastic and widespread and thetempo is far more urgent.     The dollar drain must be stopped,and unless we take action immediately we are running a serious risk that the Credit will be used up very rapidly and for purposesfrom which this country will derive little benefit.      If this -happens we lay ourselves open to the accusation that we have allowed the loan to he frittered away.We therefore propose that Sir Wilfred Eady should beauthorise to act as in paragraph 7*

ANNEX IITECHNICAL NOTE ON ACTION proposed. Foreign holders of sterling on Transferable Accountsnow have the right to pay such sterling to any country in theWorld (with unimportant exceptions).    By means of transfersto American Account they can not only, pay sterling insettlement of current transactions with the United States,tout can obtain dollars for their sterling either on the new york market or in London.     By the measures now proposed,sterling on Transferable Accounts will be convertible onlyin London and only to the amount of the ration allocated to each country.2.. This will require a modification of the PaymentsOrder so as to cut off American Accounts from other n&apos;on-reside.ntaccounts, including Transferable Accounts.      It will also require the allocation of dollar rations to individual countriesAt the outset an arbitrary ration will be allotted;    some countries will have, no claim to a ration.     At a later stage the ration may be adjusted, by ourselves.3. Negotiations will have to be set in hand at an earlydate for more permanent arrangements with the object ofmaintaining transferability to the fullest possible extent.
