IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS&apos;BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)S EC RET -COPY NO.^1C.P.(U7) 2309th. August, 19U7.CABINETTHE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS AT GENEVAMemorandum by the Prime minister&apos;    NON-DISCRIMINATIONAt their meeting on 7th August (CM. (W) 70thConclusions, Minute h) the Cabinet expressed the view that,.His Majesty&apos;s Government should not enter into any fresh ;&quot;&quot;commitments with regard to non-discrimination, even thoughthe United States Government were willing that they shouldnot take effect for some time to come.I have reconsidered this matter in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other ministers immediately concerned in the light of furtherinformation which has since been received from Geneva.The United States Delegation have stated that they areprepared to withdraw their insistence that countries with aconvertible currency should be subject to more stringentrequirements than countries with an inconvertible currency.They also seem ready to agree that, until the end of 1951 oreven March, 1952, the condition that any discriminatory action   &apos;should be subject to prior approval by the International trade organisation should be held in suspense.      They are further &apos;prepared to take action, the effect of which would be to allowcomplete freedom of action up to the end of 19h8, without therisk of subsequent challenge by the Organisation or by otherMembers.      I understand that in any event the risk of successfulchallenge on any action we might wish to take after that date is not serious.In the light of this information, &quot;I have, with theconcurrence of the Ministers referred to above, agreed that our delegation in Geneva should be instructed to accept non-discrimination provisions subject to safeguards on the lines indicated above and on the clear understanding that:-(a) no prior approval in any form shall be required before march, 1952;(b) prior approval - should thereafter be required only forthe Members&apos; general right to discriminate, not forany individual transactions or programmes;(c) reasonably objective criteria shall be included in the charter for establishing a Member&apos;s right to discriminate;
(&amp;)    if satisfactory arrangements on the lines of&quot;the marshall Plan are not forthcoming, His Majesty&apos;e government should not he hound to non-di scriminat.by any Geneva document;(e)    arrangements should he made outside the Charter tex-to give complete freedom up to the end of 1948.me are:-The principal considerations which have weighed with(a) Refusal to accept a reasonable arrangement on theabove lines would have caused immediate and seriously?friction with the United States Government, andwould have made us responsible for the breakdown of the Geneva trade negotiations which wouldcertainly have followed.      This in turn would have seriously prejudiced the success of the Marshalldiscussions.(b) A satisfactory arrangement regarding discrimination in the draft Charter offers the hest hope of escap:from the full rigour of the Loan Agreement whichpresent binds us not to discriminate against. Unit.  .States goods.II.    FREE ENTRY FOR APPLESAt their meeting on 7th August, the Cabinet disagreedwith the recommendation made in C.E.P.(47)-29 that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should concede free entry for freshapples, provided that the Canadian Government consented.On further examination,  I am satisfied -;   (a)    that the proposal for free entry for apples isnot in any way inconsistent with our announcement on 6th August regarding reductions in imports of foodstuffs from hard currency sources;      and(b)    that the acceptance of the obligation would not inany way affect our right to exclude apples fromany source so long as we remain in balance ofpayments difficulties.In view of this and of the hope that a satisfactory solution can now be found of the problem of non-discriminatiohI have agreed that the Geneva Delegation should be authorisedto make the proposed concession on the understanding -(i)    that the Canadian Government concurs, and(ii)    that the concession contributes towards a generally satisfactory settlement at Geneva.C.R.A,10, Downing Street.  S.W.1.9th August, 1947.
