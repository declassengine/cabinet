Changes in, Basic Pood RationsI see with concern from the minutes of the ministerial meeting on the Balance of Payments held on the20th August (GEN. 179/ihth Meeting) that &quot;the reduction ofthe meat, sugar and bread rations&quot; were considered as&quot;possibilities&quot;.     It is unfortunately true that some of &apos;these rations - notably meat - will have to be reduced since our reduced power to purchase supplies has made it impossible .to maintain the existing level of distribution.     But it wouldbe an entirely different thing to cut basic rations, not because they had to be cut on supply grounds, or for theprotection- of our stocks, but for psychological purposes,e,g. in order to bring the crisis home to the people.2. A cut in basic food rations cannot be an effectivemethod of obtaining the response which we must get from our people.     What is wanted is a method of calling forth an unprecedented productive effort.     Both on physiological andpsychological grounds nothing could be more disastrous forthe success of&quot;a great productive drive than general cuts in basic rations.3* Our population is already living on a lower averageintake of calories per head per day then before the war.     Wewere authoritatively warned by Sir Wilson Jameson that afurther - reduction, especially in the intake of meat, would havephysically deleterious effects (CP. (47) 170).     nevertheless we have since had to make the cuts against which he warned   us.In the case of canned, meat we have already made the cut and wemust now (see paragraph 6 (iv) below) make the cut in rationedmeat.      In these circumstances it would be a crime against the physical fitness and ability to produce of our people to cutany ration which it was not absolutely necessary to cut on grounds of supply as limited by our purchasing power.4* The economic conseq_uen.ees of cuts in basic rations
should alsSo be carefully considered.     It is agreed that one important object of our general programme should be to ease the pressure of the inflationary demand for goods in thehome market, since this demand competes directly with our ability to export.     But a cut in basic food rations, leavingfood prices as they are, has exactly the opposite effect.For example,  the cut of 2d. in the meat ration &quot;though it&apos;is inevitably table&quot; will free, I calculate, - some &quot; 20 millions perannum for expenditure on other objects.     Therefore, it will increase by that amount the inflationary pressure and tendto draw products which could otherwise be exported intoconsumption at home.     Cuts in other basic rations would havethe same bad economic effects.5*. Psychologically a cut in basic rations is incompatible with the success of our production drive. -   Itwould be a direct dis-incentive to further effort and asignal to every worker that increased effort will bring himno greater reward.Immediate Measures P-roposed6. . Our immediate measures in regard to food should therefore be as follows:- ,(i) We have already cut down the distribution of all points foods, by cutting the number of points available to each person from 32 to 28*(ii)    We can announce as soon as desired a cut of theprincipal rationed foods to commercial&apos; catering establishments.(iii)    The period during which a guest may stay at anhotel without surrendering his or her ration book will bereduced from four nights to one night.(iv)    I propose,  as soon as authority is given, to announce a cut,  as from the lhth September, of 2d. in the meat rationfrom l/2d. to l/-s.     This cut is necessary for several months of the coming year in view of the fact that we shallbe unable to buy any United States meat   in future.     So far the Argentine appears to be willing to continue to ship meat to us under our existing contract and I believe that they willcontinue to do so if, but no doubt only if, we provide anadequate flow of exports to the Argentine.     I suggest thatit is urgently necessary to arrive at a Clearings Agreementwith the &quot;Argentine Government.      If the Argentines cut offtheir supplies of meat to us the ration would have to be cut by a further h-d.(v) We have already cut the tea ration and we should keep it dov/n to the present reduced level of 2 oz. a week.This is necessary on supply grounds.(vi)   We are entirely prohibiting the importation of certainluxuries.      I should be in a position after consultation withthe Treasury to, announce a list of these.7. The above are the measures which it is necessary totake on supply grounds or as a result of Cabinet decisions todate.      If certain of our suppliers refuse to sell to us forsterling the position will have, of course,- to be reconsideredand still more severe cuts imposed.      That- situation has not
arisen so far.Additional Measures for Consideration8. If it is thought desirable to bring,home the gravity of our Balance Of Payments position to the public by some additional measures connected with food, I suggest that thebest way of doing so would be to increase the price of certainheavily subsidised rationed foodstuffs.     The ,economic effectof this &quot;would be the opposite to that which would be produced by cutting the ration while leaving the price unchanged.     Ifthe price of tea and, sugar, for ,example, were increased by2d. per lb. -  23,000,000 per year would be absorbed (assuming that the rations continued to be taken up, which I am sure that they would be).     To this extent, therefore, the pressure of home demand for other goods would be lessened, and thetask of directing resources to export would be eased.     Itcould hardly be said that such a measure, so long as the price increases were kept modest enough to allow the ration to be fully taken up, would greatly favour the rich, since the commodities would remain, rationed and the rich would be unable to get any more of them.     But if such measures areto be adopted they must be part of a general policy of limitinghome consumption in order.to increase exports.     I was concerned to note (see GEN. 179/14-th Meeting) that thePresident of the Board of Trade appeared unable to agree toany.of the proposals for diverting manufactured products tothe export market.     I cannot agree to drastic and directmeasures designed to limit the consumption of the primenecessity of&apos;life, namely food, while we remain content withgeneralities about endeavouring to persuade manufacturers to export a larger proportion of their output.Preparations against Adverse Developments,9. Careful preparations are, of course, being-made by my Ministry,  as directed by the Prime Minister,  against the contingency of having to impose further and grave cuts inour basic rations.     Consultations have been held with theTrades Union Congress Rationing Committee for the purposeof working out an acceptable system of differential rationing..I should like to inform my colleagues of two points which,are already becoming apparent in&apos; this connection.(i)    It is extremely difficult to work out any systemof differential rationing which would appreciably help the manual workers as a whole without putting a quite intolerableburden on, for.example, the housewives.     It may be thatdifferential rationing should be confined to the quite limitedcategory of heavy workers;(ii)    If serious cuts in one or more basic rations become inevitable, we are advised by all nutritional authorities that the.urgency of de-rationing bread will become very greatindeed.      (I atte.chH&quot;a copy of a letter from Sir Wilson Jamesonto my Deputy Secretary).     Fortunately it seems probable thatwe shall be able to do this on supply grounds, if either ourpresent negotiations for 70 per cent, of the Australianexportable surplus are concluded or the Russian negotiations are successfully resumed.     When we have a greater assurance of- the Australian crop prospects, which should be in a fewweeks&apos;  time, it&apos;should be possible to see an assured, supplyof wheat for the whole of the coming crop year*     We are+ Annex
already estimating our requirements at 103,000 tons of flourper week, which is the pre-bread rationing leveL since the ration scheme is now making only a very small amount of saving.    A further reason why the de-rationing of breadis becoming highly desirable is anxiety over the adequacy of the potato supply over the coming year.     Bread and potatoes are alternative &quot;fillers&quot; and a restriction on one immediately produces pressure on the other.     In fact,it is probable that we shall be- faced with the choice-of de-rationing bread or rationing potatoes.     I hope to make recommendations to my colleagues on this point next month.Ministry of Food; S.V7. 1.,25*h August, 19h7.  fc-h-
ANNEXMinistry of Health,Whitehall, S.W. 1,&quot;  23rd August, 1947.Dear Perrott,I understand that the reductions   in cannedend cercase meet which we discussed some weeks ego mustnovt take place end that there is a possibility of reductions in the retions of other besic foodstuffs.I should like to impress on you a, point ofview which I end the medical members of my Committeehave made on previous occasions, namely, that it is^ofthe utmost importance that in these circumstances bread and flour should be- de-rationed if this is in any way possible on supply grounds.     Otherwise, I fear thatthere may be serious nutritional consequences for certaingroups of the popula.tion, in particular adolescents and heavy manual workers.Yours sincerely,(Signed)    WILSON JAMESON.   .D,C,V, Perrott9 Esq.,Ministry of Pood.
