(47) 24629th August, 1947CABINETNATIONALISATION OF THE IRON AND STEEL industry note by the Secretary of the CabinetBY the Prime Ministers direction I circulate the attached copy of a letter addressed to him by the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation.(Signed) NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W,jl,2,9th August, 1947.&apos; 23rd August, 1947.Dear Mr. Prime Minister,Nationalisation of the Iron and Steel industry the Executive Council of this Organisation had this important question under consideration at its Meetings held during this week.Considerable consternation was expressed at the suggested delay which might take place in introducing the necessary legislation, and a long discussion tookplace on the matter.Our Officers and Executive Members from every part of the country stressed the fact that there was an urgent demand from our membership for immediatenationalisation of this important industry.Our Executive Council was somewhat perturbed at the hesitant policy whichhas been pursued by the Government in relation to its pledge to nationalise theIron and Steel Industry, and grave doubts were expressed as to whether Mr. Wilmotwith his multifarious duties, could efficiently handle this question; it is suggestedtherefore, that the Government give immediate attention to the need for a Ministerfor Iron and Steel, who should be a person well versed in the intricacies of theindustry, and who would devote his- whole energies to this important matter.Full regard was paid in the discussions, to the difficulty the Government-finds itself in consequent upon the present economic crisis, but it is felt that thisshould be no impediment to immediate nationalisation of Iron and Steel; indeed the fact that the running and development of this important industry was underGovernmental control, and divorced from capitalistic interests, should help theGovernment to achieve economic stability more rapidly than otherwise couldbe the case., The fact that any delay at the present time would probably mean that theindustry would not be nationalised in the life-time of the present Parliamentalso gave our Executive Council much food for thought, and following its longdeliberations on this matter, it was decided to issue a report to the Press asfollows: At the Quarterly Meeting held during the present week, the ExecutiveCouncil of this Trade Union representing the bulk of the workers in the -Iron and Steel Industry, expressed considerable surprise at the statements-34156
which have appeared in various sections of the Press, that there is no demandfor the immediate nationalisation of the Iron and Steel Industry from theworkers employed therein., ; It should not be presumed that because there has been little publicityof the activities of this Union, that either from the industrial or politicalangle it has been idle.When negotiating agreements with the Employers&apos; Association for betterwages and conditions, regard has always been paid to the need for outputswhich would,justify the presentation of the various claims, with the resultthat a wage structure has been built up in which wages in the main dependon outputs.On the political side careful attention has been given to any legislation which is calculated to affect the Iron and Steel Industry, and our opinionsfully and frankly given to whatever Government has been in power.The recent agreement which provides for the continuous operationright through the week-end, of the open hearth steel furnaces in the HeavySteel Trade, is an outstanding example of the willingness of the workers. . in the Industry to obtain maximum outputs. This agreement means that every ton of steel possible is being produced from the existing plant, subject only to a sufficient coal supply.No urge has been needed from the Government for maximum production from the Steel Industry; indeed the maximum output is laid at the feet ofthe Government by workers who realise that in addition to the many finished products directly produced from the Melting Shops and Mills, Steel is the raw material for many highly finished engineering products so urgently needed for export to-day.To disappoint these workers by procrastination in the matter of nationalisation would be a bitter disillusionment for them. Let there beno misunderstanding, the officers and Executive Council brought from allthe Iron and Steel districts of England, Scotland and Wales a demand forimmediate nationalisation. This is the voice the Government must notignore ! Our membership in every part of the country makes its strong protest against any postponement of the nationalisation of this importantIndustry.A resolution in the following terms was unanimously agreed, and is being sent to the Prime Minister:&quot; The Executive Council of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederationdeclares that it stands for and demands full and immediate nationalisation of the Iron and Steel Industry.&quot;I trust that the Cabinet will at its next meeting give due consideration tothe opinions of this important organisation, which has consistently given itsstaunch support to the Labour Government since it came to power in 1945.Yours very sincerely,(Signed) H. DOUGLASS,Assistant General Secretary.I
