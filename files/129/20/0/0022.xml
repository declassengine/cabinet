THIS. DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E C R E&quot; TCP. (h7) 2221ST AUGUST.  1QU7COPY NO.cabinet british NATIONALITY bill memorandum, by the Home secretary the attached draft Bill gives effect-to the new schemefor maintaining throughout the Commonwealth the principle ofthe &quot;common status&quot;, i.e. the principle that every personrecognised by the law of one - Commonwealth country as belongingto the Commonwealth should be so recognised by the laws of allthe   other countries.     The principles of the scheme were approved by the Cabinet on 9th September, 19h-6 (CM. 80thConclusions, Minute 5);    and in February, 1947, therewas aconference of experts from the several Commonwealth countries(i.e. the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,South Africa, Eire, Newfoundland, Southern Rhodesia, Burma and ceylon) to review the changes that would be required in thenew Nationality. Law.2. .   The draft Bill is based on the recommendations towhich the conference agreed, and the inclusion of this Bill inthe 1947-8 Parliamentary Programme has been approved.3* The new scheme.depends on legislation being passed in each of the countries concerned, and it is hoped that theUnited Kingdom measure will serve as a model for legislation inother Commonwealth countries.     There must therefore beconsultation with the Governments of these countries beforethe final form of the Bill is settled, and they are. expecting to ,see a draft.     It is accordingly desired to send the attached draft Bill without delay to the Governments of the countries mentioned   in Clause 1 (2) and to the Government of Eire.     If,as is hoped, there is general agreement by these governments with the major provisions of the Bill, it will be difficultsubsequently to make substantial changes, and I think itdesirable that the Cabinet should see the draft at this stage.h* Clause 1 of the Bill gives effect to the principlethat there shall be created by United Kingdom legislation a combined citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies which .will be the gateway through which the common status of Britishsubjects will be conferred upon the inhabitants of both theUnited Kingdom and the Colonies, and that persons who are by corresponding legislation in the other Commonwealth countriesmade citizens of those countries will be recognised as Britishsubjects in the United Kingdom and the Colonies.5. This clause also gives effect to the   proposal, towhich the Cabinet agreed in September last, that in the UnitedKingdom legislation the status of British subjects shall not be
automatically conferred upon Eire citizens.     Clause 2 of the    ,&apos;Bill, however, preserves, in accordance with the cabinet decision, the status as British subjects under United Kingdomlaw of such Eire citizens, born before the new legislationcomes into force, as may claim to retain that status.     At theconference the Eire delegates explained, that any preservationpresented objections in principle from their point of view, and represented that if there were to be such preservation, itshould be limited to persons with &quot;a proved attachment&quot; to thestatus of British subjects.     Clause 2 was drafted to giveeffect to this doctrine of &quot;proved attachment&quot;, and the Eiredelegates- at the conference were prepared to acquiesce in it -subject to the omission of the last words of sub-section (l)&quot;or wishes to be associated with the United Kingdom and colonies&quot;.     The Eire Government will, no doubt, press forthe omission of these words, and I think it will be right tomake this concession if by such concession the acceptance bythe Eire Government of the new legislation can be secured.6. As from the date of the passing of the new legislationEire citizens (other than those existing persons who may claim the right to remain British subjects under clause 2 or thosewho happen also to be citizens of some other commonwealth country - e.g. the Irishman born in England) will cease to be british subjects in name.     In general, hov/ever,  the status of Eire citizens within the Commonwealth will (assuming thecountries of the Commonwealth pass corresponding legislation)be similar to the status of persons who by being citizens ofa Commonwealth country will be British subjects,.      Clause 30 (1)makes it clear that a citizen of Eire will not be an &quot;alien&quot;,and Clause 3(2) makes it clear that the rights and obligations which by past United Kingdom legislation have been conferred-onEire citizens qua British subjects will remain unaltered..7. The Bill contemplates the creation of a number ofdistinct citizenships within the Commonwealth,  and as one methodof giving practical expression to the conception of the &quot;commonstatus&quot; it enables citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies to be acquired by citizens of other commonwealth countries and of Eire by a simpler-process and   on easier termsthan are applicable to the naturalisation of aliens.8* The Bill also gives effect to the principles towhich the Cabinet have agreed regarding married women.     Marriedwomen will no longer be under a disability in the matter of nationality.     The provision in the British Nationality and status of Aliens Act, 191*4, that &quot;the expression &quot;disability1-means the status of being a married woman or a minor, lunaticor idiot&quot; will disappear, and the   only disability retained bythe new legislation is the provision in Clause 30 (2) relatingto minors and.persons of unsound mind.     Y/omen will not afterthe passing of the Bill lose British nationality by marriage to foreigners, though they will be able to renounce it if they     ;possess another   nationality.     Those \^omen who have in thepast lost their British nationality by marriage will under clause 16 of the Bill automatically become citizens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies and thereby British subjects,A foreign woman who marries a citizen of the United Kingdomand Colonies will not automatically trecome a British subject,but will, under Clause 7, be entitled on marriage to apply tobe registered as a citizen and   on being so registered willacquire British nationality.
9. Provision hes also been made in the Bill for improving the status as members of the Commonwealth ofBritish protected persons.     Clause 3 (3) provides thatsuch persons shall not be subject to the special restrictions   and disabilities imposed on aliens by the aliens Restrictions Acts of 191k and 1919,  and paragraph 3of the First Schedule contains provisions for facilitating the naturalisation of British protected persons.10.       No doubt changes in detail may be found desirable asa result of consultation with the Governments of theCommonwealth countries and of further examination of someof the subsidiary provisions, but I aslr. that the cabinet will, at this stage, approve the draft, subject to drafting amendments, as suitable for coramunication to the commonwealth governments.Home Office, S.W. l.,1st August, 19U7
