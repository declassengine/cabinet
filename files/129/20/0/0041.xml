259S, DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)SECRET %1.     At the meeting of Ministers held on 20th August. 1947(Gen. 17S/14th Meeting) the President of the Board of Tradesuggested that &quot;special attention should be.paid to the production for export of agricultural machinery and that the possibility of persuading motor manufacturers to switch over to the productionof agricultural machinery ought to be carefully examined.&quot;2,     On the strength of the Prime Minister&apos;s speech in the Houseof Commons on 6th August (Hansard, .6th August, 1947, column 1504)and on the assurances as regards raw material supplies given bythe Central Economic Planning Staff, the Lord President hasalready announced that the Government &quot;will insist upon high priority for agriculture&apos;s requirements from all Departments&quot;and, further, that &quot;the Government have decided that this programme of agricultural expansion must be carried out and there-fore that agriculture must be given the tools to do it.Instructions have been issued accordingly to the departments responsible.&quot; (Speech to Chairman of Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees, 21st August, 1947).3.     At the 24th Meeting of the Lord President&apos;s Committee heldon 8th August, it was agreed that the Materials Committee should consider the requirements of the agricultural industry for additional supplies of raw materials for agricultural machinery and other purposes.     The next meeting of the Materials Committeehas been fixed for 25th August.4.     The requirements of sheet steel, general steel, castings,etc., needed not only to ensure the production of adequate supplies of agricultural machinery for the home market, but alsoto secure a substantial expansion of exports have already been formulated and submitted to the Materials Committee.     As regardssteel (sheet and general), the requirements represent for G-fceatBritain ah increase-from  47,000 tons in Period IJI 1947 to 112.0Q0tonsin Period IV &quot;Iy47, rising to about 124,000 tons in Period III 1948.If these quantities, with slightly more in succeeding quarters,can be made available, together with the proper proportions ofother raw materials, it will be possible to double the output ofagricultural machinery for home use during the next 12 months and,at the same time, to double exports within the next six months&amp;s compared with the last year) and to quadrulple them by aboutthe end of 1948.CP. (47) 24123RD AUGUST. 1947CABINETBALANCE OP PAYMENTS:EXPANSION OF PRODUCTION FOR&quot;EXPORT OF agricultural machinery &apos; -&quot; -Note by the Ministry. of Agriculture
5.     Allocations by themselves are not enough.     Great delayis experienced in obtaining delivery of some items, and theonly satisfactory way of overcoming this problem is by addingsteel, etc., for agricultural purposes to what is known as&quot;the Prime Minister&apos;s list&quot;, so as to secure equal prioritywith other needs, of the highest importance.6.     Some still further expansion of agricultural machineryproduction should become possible later, though this may involve providing further capacity and machine tools, aswell as a good deal more experienced labour.     It might bemore realistic to make progress with the present very substantial plans before laying down a wider programme,though discussions could take place with the industrymeanwhile.7o     The Ministry of Supply, in consultation with the Ministryof Agriculture, will examine the question of switching the motor industry over to the production of agricultural machinery.     The Ministry of Supply advise that no suchconversion could be effected quickly and without majordislocation.     It is thought that the two principal firmsat present most closely concerned - Pords and Standards -will be able to increase their output of tractors from about280 a day (in total) to at least 500 or 600 a day, if the materials are made available, without appreciably interferingv/ith their production of cars.     The Nuffield Group have abandoned their earlier intention to enter into tractorproduction with a machine rather more powerful than thePordson, which would fill a gap in present production pro-grammes;   but they might be persuaded to reconsider thematter.     This matter will be examined in conjunction withthe general question of some switch-over of production.Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries, S.W.1.23rd August, 1947.4
