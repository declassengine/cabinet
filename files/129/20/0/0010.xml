APPENDIXCopy of Despatch from the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to H.M. Ambassador atWashingtonI met Mr. Lewis Douglas to-day.      He came todiscuss with me a communication from Mr.  Secretary Marshall,which is annexed.2. I informed the Ambassador that we had already communicate with Mr. Marshall and showed him the telegram which had been sent.      I assured him that this matter was receiving urgent attention and was to be placed before theCabinet on Wednesday.      In the meantime I should be glad to hear his Government&apos;s views in order that we might agree onthe reply that is to be sent to Paris.3* In the course of discussion I pointed out toMr. Douglas that a good deal of this difficulty had arisenowing to the leakage in Germany of reports of the discussions which had not reached their final stage.     But as far as Ihad examined the proposals they seemed to be in keeping witha consistent policy, which His Majesty&apos;s Government had followed since the conclusion of the war.     The figures onwhich the two Generals had been-working were, broadly speaking, those which we thought necessary in order to get a balanced economy, with Germany making her contribution towardsthe recovery of Europe, but at the same time making sure that^security was not endangered.      In view, however, of thedifficulty that had arisen in connection with the Frenghprotest, I was inclined to agree that it might he better to reconsider the plan with a view to submitting it as thestandard which would be accepted not only as a contribution
to the recovery of Germany hut as a solution to Europeanproblems as well.      I told Mr. Douglas that I would addressray mind to that end and would give him a reply on Wednesday.U. The American Ambassador then turned to the questionof the discussion of the problem of coal.     I pointed out tohim the inconsistency of the agenda which had been submitted.In Item 1 it was suggested that the Committee should discuss&quot;the assurance of food, in appropriate quantity and quality,to mine workers and their families&quot;.     This was an easymatter to discuss but if given effect to. it involved GreatBritain in greater dollar payments and that we could not stand.      Therefore to rule out any financial consideration was, in our view,  impossible.      Similarly, the some difficultyarose over Item h - (&quot;Mine supplies and equipment for internal and export needs&quot;).      I indicated to Mr. Douglas that we hadalready provided an urgent inventory of what was needed toget the output of cool, and this equipment would have tocome in the main from the United States.     None had beenforthcoming and if it was placed on the basis of yearlycommitments,  again dollars would he involved and we couldnot undertake this.5. With regard to Item 10 (&quot;The future tenure of management and problems of stewardship&quot;), I indicated that I did not really know what it meant.     Mr. Douglas said that itmeant the right of engagement and dismissal on grounds of efficiency.6. As to Item 11 (&quot;Elimination of uncertainty in the ownership status of the mines&quot;), I informed Mr. Douglas thatI had received no suggestion from the United States as to who should own the mines.      Was it intended to hold on to themwith a view to giving them back to private ownership?     If so,the position of the Social Democrats in Germany would be entirely undermined.      And,  after all,  they were the one party
who had withstood Communist infiltration.      They also carriedwith them the   Trade Unions.      Therefore, I could not accept any situation which allowed the mines to go hack to private ownership.     What was wrong in the British proposal of allowingthese mines to be owned by the public and thereby giving thepeople working in the mines a vested interest in working forpeaceful purposes?     The Ambassador&apos;s answer was that theUnited States Government did not desire to rule out the questionof who should own the mines.     What they wanted to do was toprevent the uncertainty of the ownership interfering with theproduction of coal.      I expressed the view that it certainlydid, that the Socialists were very concerned,  as indeed manyof the Christian Democrats were, about the mines going backto the syndicates, or being&apos;used for exploitation purposesagainst the workmen.     Mr. Douglas then asked whether I wouldhave any objection to a discussion on this matter as towhether the uncertainty regarding ownership affected output.7* On the question of increased prices of coal, i expressed the view to Mr. Douglas that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be in favour of that, but I suggested, inview of the Paris Conference and the many upsetting thingsgoing on in Europe, that it might be wise to make it1st September instead of 1st August.8. The American Ambassador then made a special appealto me to send a team of officials to Washington and explained .that the main object of this party going to Washington was thedesire of the United States Government to lift this matterfrom- the level on which it had been hitherto to a governmentallevel.      Evidently there were internal difficulties theysought to overcome.      After thinking the matter over, I saidthat if it was purely coal and output that had to be dealtwith, then obviously the composition of the team would have tohave a more technical as well as financial character in order-3-
that it might deal with the, matters referred to above,9* Mr. Douglas then asked whether I would agree tosend a team to,Washington on the terms of reference todiscuss the technical question affecting the output of coolin the Ruhr, with this stipulation that if in this discussionextra dollar commitments were - involved, then it was with&apos;a clear understanding that we could not undertake.it.      I saidthat if a technical discussion on coal was involved, it wouldhave to be explained to the French, or once more they wouldtake a wrong view of the matter.      If it was kept on this basis,  I would favourably consider it, but before I could say&quot;Yes&quot;, I would have to consult the Cabinet on Wednesday andthen give the United States Government the answer.      I addedthat I must stipulate that the agenda of the discussion shouldnot be published and that there should be no publicity of any kind except a statement that it was a technical discussion.I repeated with emphasis that we were not to be committed to more dollar obligations.      In fact we neededrelief.     We&apos;were disappointed that there had not been moreflexibility in using sterling to relieve us.      Mr. Douglasagreed that this was important.10. Since dictating this record I have caused enquiriesto be made of Mr. Douglas as to whether we might have theUnited States view on the items of our agenda which wouldenable us to give a line to the Delegation as to the coursethey should take.
MEM.Message from Mr. Marshall to Mr. Bevincommunicated by the United States Ambassador?21st July,  19U7.In- addition to the formal communication -we have both received from the French Government expressing itsconcern over the new bizonal plan for the level of german industry in our Zones,  I have received a personal message from Bidault expressing in even more direct language thealarm of the French Government over the consequences of any announcement of this plan both in the internal situationin France and the position of the French Government in regardto any programme of European recovery.      I am sure you will agree with me that the attitude of the French government cannot be disregarded in this matter, and I feel we must make some concerted communication to the French Government inorder to reassure them as to our intentions.I, therefore, suggest for your consideration that weseparately address a communication to M. Bidault informing .him that the United States and United Kingdom governments will suspend further announcement on the agreed plan forrevised bizonal level of industry in Germany until the FrenchGovernment,has reasonable   opportunity to present its viewsfor full consideration.I would appreciate your urgent views on thissuggestion.
