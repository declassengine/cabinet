MINERS. agricultural workers AND KEY WORKERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AREASNote by the Lord President of the council I attach, for the consideration of my colleagues,a memorandum which I have received from the chairman of the materials Committee and the Chief Planning Officer on thequestion how best to secure a general priority for housing and other accommodation to be provided for miners,agricultural workers and key workers in development areas.This memorandum was prepared in pursuance of a decision ofthe Fuel Committee on 11th July, 1947 (P.C.(47) 19th Meeting,Minute 5, Conclusion (2)).H.M.Great George Street, S.W. 1.5th September, 1947.
PSIOBITY-OI HOUSING FOR MINERS, agricultural workers AND KEY WORKERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AREASMemorandum by the Chairman of the MaterialsCommittee and&quot;&quot;chief Planning officer. We were Invited by the Fuel Committee (F.0.(47) 19thMeeting, Minute 5, Conclusion (2)), in consultation with the &apos;Minister of Works, to investigate how best to secure a generalpriority for housing and other accommodation for miners,agricultural&quot;workers and key workers in development areas.2. We have assumed that the size of the total housing programme will he pre-determined and that our task is torecommend steps to give priority, within that total programme,to the building of houses for workers of the specified classes.3* The existence in Scotland of a Housing Association whichhas taken special steps in the provision of houses for minersdistinguishes the position there from that in England andWales, and we have restricted our consideration of this problem to England and Wales only.      The Secretary of State for scotland will doubtless adopt such of the following recommendations as are approved by Ministers and appropriate in the particular circumstances in Scotland.h. As the Board of Trade have stated that In the mainthey are satisfied with the action already taken to providehouses for key workers in development areas, we have confinedour detailed enquiries to the problem of houses for miners and agricultural workers.     The measures we recommend for the lattercould,  however,  also be applied without difficulty in the caseof the former.5* Under the present legislation, houses are normallybuilt and let by local authorities according to housing needs and without regard to the occupations of intended tenants.Nevertheless, we are satisfied that, without fresh legislation and with administrative action alone, it is possible to givea substantial priority to miners and agricultural workers.In the case of houses the contracts for which have alreadybeen approved:6. We are advised that in these cases it would not hepracticable to require LOcal Authorities&quot;to give preference inletting to workers in special occupations. But there are&apos; twosteps which con he taken and which we recommend.7* First:    The Ministry of Health, on the basis of a clear statement of Government policy, to which we refer inparagraph 13 below, could by persuasion materially influence theletting of these houses in favour of miners and agricultural workers.8. Second:   Houses now being built in predominantly mining and agricultural areas could be finished more quickly if a special priority in the supply of essential materials and components wereto be authorised.     As, however,, such priority could be accordedonly in a limited number of areas, it will not be possible to
introduce it for any and every area where some houses might conceivably be let to these workers.      In the case of miners,more than two-thirds of all the houses required are concentrated in about fifty Local Authority areas.     We have asked the Ministryof Agriculture to provide a list of about the same number of ares which would cover the largest possible proportion of the housing needs of agricultural workers.    . We recommend that the Ministryof Works should, then, be authorised to give the necessary priority in materials and components to those houses, -within these 100 or soareas, which are definitely earmarked for occupation by miners oragricultural workers.Such a priority can only be effective - given the sametotal output of building materials - at the expense of some delay in the completion of houses in other areas. .In the case of future contracts;9. Normally the Ministry of Health allocates permission.to tender to the various Local Authorities solely in accordancewith housing needs.     We recommend that the Ministry of Healthbe authorised,  in granting such permission,  to favour LocalAuthorities who cater for miners and agricultural workers.Moreover, for the 100 or so areas referred to above, permission to proceed to tender should, in future, be conditioned by a clear undertaking that a stated number or proportion of thehouses concerned will be let to workers of one or other of the specified classes.10. It is impossible to lay down in advance for each area the extent to which a diversion from urban to agricultural areaspr from mixed industrial areas to mining areas is, in fact,practicable.      It will-be necessary for each zone to&apos;consider itslocal problems and to make recommendations.      Where these recommendations affect the diversion of labour between housing and non-housing projects, they should be referred to the Regional and,if necessary, the Headquarters Building Committees.     Where theyaffect only the distribution of houses as between one class of thecommunity and another, the final decision should be taken by theMinistry of Health.11. Success in this type of action depends very much on theextent to which building labour is mobile.      In some agriculturalareas, it should be possible to secure a substantial diversionfrom urban housing work;    in mining areas, the possibilitiesare considerably less.      It is doubtful whether detailed directionof labour as adopted during the war is practicable;    heavy increasein costs is necessarily involved where building labour is workingaway from home and there is the problem of finding housing accommodation for the building workers themselves.     We considerthat by a judicious rebalancing of local building programmes and a severe limitation on licensing of building work for other thanabsolutely essential purposes,  it will be possible to secure the diversion of a substantial number of existing, workers. .12., The Minister of Works takes the view that therecommendations in the,three preceding paragraphs will not secure the necessary results.      He believes that Rural LocalAuthorities will be unable to face the financial burdens involved and also unwilling to build houses to let to workers coming into their areas from outside.
He believes that the only way to secure the building ofthe necessary number of&quot;houses for new recruits in agriculturalareas is through the agency of a new central organisationspecially created for this purpose.Such an organisation should, he urges, be set upimmediately to supplement the work of Local Authorities whowould continue,  as now, to build houses to let to the existinginhabitants of their own areas.13* This proposal raises far reaching issues upon which itis difficult for-us to express an opinion, nor, in the time a tour. disposal have we been able to explore fully all the aspectsof this suggestion.     We recommend, in the circumstances, thatthe other steps-we put forward be adopted forthwith and that theproposal made by the Minister of Works be remitted to a suitablecommittee of officials for further examination and report.There is much to be said,  in any case, for working out a plan of the general kind proposed by the Minister of works in case some of the Local Authorities concerned do, in fact, falldown on the job.Contracts have been placed for an additional 15,000aluminium houses and the Ministry of Health is already engagedin the necessary administrative action to secure that the maximum possible number of these houses shall be erected in mining areas.It is, of course,  essential that sites snail be ready for the reception of these houses immediately they become available fromthe factories which produce them.      It has occurred to us that bythe use of a supervisory nucleus provided from the Ministry ofWorks mobile labour force,  supplemented by Prisoners-of-War, Poles :or European Volunteer Workers, it might be possible to expeditesite preparation and slabbing where, in the normal course ofevents&apos;, this work would fall behind the necessary programme.13*       &apos;    We. are satisfied that the action already being taken bythe Ministry of Health to expedite the acceptance and erection of Airey rural houses is all that can be done, except to theextent -to which the Ministry of Works mobile labour force,including Poles,  can also give assistance here in at least themost exceptionally difficult areas.16. Detailed discussions and negotiations proceed constantlybetween the Ministry of Fuel and Power and the Ministry ofAgriculture and Fisheries on the one hand and the Ministry ofWorks on the other regarding the provision of hostels for miners and agricultural workers.      It does not appear to us that any exceptional steps in connection with the provision of   hostelsare, at present, necessary.     The Ministries of Fuel and Powerand Agriculture and Fisheries will, no doubt, report to the FuelCommittee and/or to the Lord President&apos;s Committee any anticipatedshortfall -of hostel provision below essential needs,17. We emphasise strongly that there should be a cleardeclaration not only of Government policy but also of the actualsteps to be taken to speed up provision of houses for workers ofthe specified classes.      No doubt such a declaration Bhould form part of a statement to be made on the whole Housing Programme.The precise form of the declaration would need to be considered in relation to that statement, but we suggest that it should cover the points mentioned in the draft appended - which, in effect,summarises our recommendations-.H.G.1st September, jgJj-Zr . w -
appendix the Government has already announced substantially increased targets for production of deep-mined coal and agricultural products.      The urgency of these needs is such that the Government think it essential to secure quickly themaximum number of houses for these purposes even though thisobject can only be secured at the expense of other sectionsof the community.     They are accordingly taking the following steps(l) The Local Authorities concerned have been requested inthe letting of new houses now under construction, orin other accommodation at their disposal, to give thefullest possible consideration to applications fromminers, agricultural workers and key workers.(2) Special steps are being taken to secure the promptdelivery of materials and components necessary toComplete houses already under construction in eachof about fifty Local Authority areas containingsubstantial mining communities and approximately the same number of Local Authority areas &quot;in whichthere is an important agricultural population.(3) The first call on the permanent aluminium house,production of which will commence in the Autumn of19U7, will be given to Local Authorities&apos; who havea special need for houses for miners and who havesites ready prepared for these houses.(k) In settling the scale for new housing contracts forareas containing districts in which the need for more houses for. miners, agricultural workers or keyworkers is urgent and substantial, the health departments will arrange for the maximum number ofhouses to be built who re they can be let to these groups.     This will involve a reduction in thenumber of houses which can be placed under contract-in adjacent districts.(5) Arrangements for the expanded production of houses in the selected areas will bo conditional upon anundertaking from the Local Authority to let notless than some previously determined proportion ofthe houses contracted for to one or other of thethroe special classes of workers referred to.     Theproportion will vary in individual areas and the health Departments will, after discussion with theLocal Authorities concerned, settle what theproportion shall in each case be.(6) The arrangements in regard to letting of contracts willbe kept under review in the light of progress madewith the provision of houses for miners, agricultural workers and key workers,/Xl) A national organisation will be created as soon aspossible to undertake the building of houses incertain rural (and mining) areas for the accommodation of recruits to the mining and agricultural industries from outside areasjj7
