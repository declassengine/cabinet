300(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)secret .P. (47^)248   .5TH SEPTEMBER.,1947CABINETDIRECTION OP LABOURMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National ServiceSince I submitted my paper, CP. (47)  244? reporting on -the meeting of the Joint Consultative Committee about control of engagement and direction of labour,  the General Council of theTrades Union Congress have sent me the following Resolution:-&quot;The General Council accepts the view of the Governmentthat to be effective the Control of Engagement Order will involve a limited direction of labour&apos;in order to secure the better distribution of man-power enforced upon this country by the   present serious economic.situation and the consequentnecessity to utilise our available resources for the purpose ofthe economic recovery of the nation.     The General Councilauthorises its. representatives on the Minister of Labour&apos;sJ.C.C to discuss the implications of the re-introduction ofthe Control of Engagement Order and the Governments decision that this involves a limited direction of labour.     With aview to clarifying the position the General Council instruct their representatives to discuss provisions that may benecessary to safeguard the conditions of the workers affected and the principle of equality of sacrifice and   of bringing intoproductive industry those who are at present making no contribution to the national well-being;    and   in addition toexamine the possibilities of further reducing the Armed Forces&quot;.2, This removes much of my earlier objections to theimmediate use of direction.of labour in connection with theoperation of the Control of Engagement Order.      It is, however,necessary in my view to meet the two points mode by the T.U.C.relating to (a)    safeguarding the conditions of workers affected;and (b)    the need, in the   interests of equality of sacrifice,to bring into essential work those who are at present making no contribution to the national well-being.3, With regard to safeguarding the conditions of workers who may be directed, I hope to be able to satisfy the T,U.C,by means of the following proposals:-(l)   Workers subject to the Control of Engagement Orderto be given as wide a choice as possible amongst available jobs in the most urgent categories;    a direction to be issued only .in the last resort if a worker, having been given full opportunity and reasonable range of selection, still insists on takingunessential work or refuses to take any work at all.     In practice this would mean that   ordinarily a direction would not be issued,unless and until three or four alternative opportunities had been refused.COPY NO.     j I
(2)    Single men and single women without family responsibilities to be offered employment on essential work within daily travelling distance;    if, however, no vacanciesexisted in these industries within drily travelling distance,they would be offered and if necessary required to take jobson essential work in other districts provided accommodationwas available.     Women under 20 years of*age, however, not tobe directed away from home.(3)    Men and women with family responsibilities to be offered employment on essential work within daily travellingdistance and only in special cases to be offered, and if.necessrry required to take employment which would require theirliving away from home or at unreasonable distance from their homes, in which cases they would be entitled to living-away-from-home allowances under the conditions of the existing scheme.(h)    Men and women to be offered and if necessary requiredto take.essential work in occupations other than their normaloccupation if essential work in their normal occupation is not-available.(5)    A registered disabled person not to be issued with a direction in any circumstances.(6)   An administrative right of appeal against a direction to be afforded to the worker.(7)    A direction to remain operative for a fixed period,normally 6 months,  after which the worker would be free unless a. new direction was issued.In addition the existing Control of Engagement (DirectedPersons) Order, 19h3,  (S.R. &amp; 0. 651) already safeguards theinterests of the directed person by providing:-(a) that the employer must- retain him in his employment for the period specified in the direction;(b) that the employer may however provisionally dismiss adirected worker for serious misconduct, there being a right ofappeal against such dismissal to the Local Appeal Board andreinstatement if the worker wins his appeal;(c) that at any time the directed person or the employermay apply for the directions to be withdrawn and if this is not done, either side has a. right of appeal to the Local AppealBo ard;(d) that if the directed worker, is put on short time without- pay, he is no longer held to the employment.      (This is the nearest approach possible in these cases to the guaranteed wee&apos;:which used to be afforded under the Essential Work Orders).Finally,, the rates of wages and conditions of employment of adirected person are already safeguarded by the existing provisions made in Article 2 of Defence Regulation 58A whichprescribes that work done under direction shall be at &quot;therate for the job&quot;.k* With regard to- the need, in the interests of equality of sacrifice,   to bring into essential work others such as
&quot;spivs&quot; and &quot;drones&quot; who ere doing nothing towards the nationalwell-being,. I have now received a report from the Working Party.I set up to consider this matter, and I attach that report as an Annex.     My views on the   points of policy raised Inparagraph 13 of that report are as followss-(l)   We should agree that the power of direction shouldbe used not only for direction in connection with the Controlof Engagement Order, but also for combing men and women out ofundesirable street trading, out of the football pools andother branches of the gambling industry, and out of such employment as night club employment and also for the purposeof putting to work those who for no good reason are not doingcry work at all.(2)    With regard to the measures to be taken to enable this to be done, we, should -(a) at once introduce legislation providing that no person between the ages of control shall engage in street trading without a certificate that hehas registered for employment at an employment exchange and that he is not required for essential work;(b) make an Order under Defence Regulation 58A requiring the principals in the gambling industry, includingthe football pools and amusement arcades, to registerparticulars of themselves and their employees withinthe ages of control with a view to their being submitted, and if necessary directed,  to more essential employment where that is available;(c) not introduce legislation controlling all employmentin all clubs, respectable and otherwise, with a viewto catching the comparatively small number employedin night clubs and the like,  as the general resentmentthis v/ould  cause would be more than the negligibleresults would justify;    but we should be able, withthe co-operation of the police,  to track down the proprietors of many of the less reputable establish-ments and their employees so as to require them under defence Regulation 80B to attend at an employment exchange for interview and to direct them in suitable cases to essential work.     It must* be recognised thatthis might involve accusations of snooping;(d) register compulsorily all unoccupied persons withinthe ages of control.      I make this recommendation withsome hesitation as whilst it will produce some usefulresults we-must recognise that it is likely to be verywidely evaded, and that we, shall not be ablesystematically to catch those who do not comply.This is however the best that can be done.(3)-   I agree with the Working Party that no further action should be taken with regard to the comparatively small numberof persons employed in connection with sport.5t I would particularly draw the attention of mycolleagues to paragraph 12 of the Working Party&apos;s report.Whilst the above proposals will make some contribution - atsome cost in Civil Service man-power - towards remedying thepresent situation;, I am sure that the greatest contribution can
only come from removing the root cause, viz., the presentinflationary pressure.6. Apart from the classes of people-dealt with in theWorking Party&apos;s report,&apos; I th.ink.it is essential that we should give an assurance that Poles in the Resettlement Corps will no longer be allowed to remain in idleness on military pay: when,work is available for them which they will not take.     I should like to be in a position to say that in such cases the Poleswill be struck off military pay and directed, if necessary,into employment.     I know that- this raises a difficult questionof the breach of undertakings given to the Poles when theywere invited to join the Resettlement Corps,  and I would suggestthat this aspect of the problem should be considered by theForeign Office and the Service Departments in conjunction with my Department. .7. In conclusion.I would refer to the difficulties withwhich we are faced in the re-deployment of labour owing to thegreat scarcity of housing and of lodging accommodation.      i suggest that there are two practicable ways   in which this difficulty could be partially overcome -(a) By allowing old-age pensioners and others inreceipt of supplementary allowances to receive billet-ees withoutthe profit being taken into account in assessing the pensioner1sincome j(b) By removing the present ban on the building of newhostels or camps for the accommodation of workers,  to theextent at least to -which such accommodation could be providedby making use of old camp material and equipment.     The mobilesquads of building workers employed by the Ministry of Workscould- be expanded so far as necessary to meet this need.     Also,members of the Polish Resettlement Corps could be used forthis purpose, if necessary under military discipline.8. So far as can be estimated at this stage it seems likely that these proposals will involve the employment ofsome h,500 additional staff on work in connection with theoperation of the Control of Engagement Order and the registration and interviewing of unoccupied persons.     This,however, will be offset by a reduction in staff resulting fromthe cutting of the building training programme and the reductionof work on the issue of passports.G. A. I.-Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1.,5th September, 19h7.-k-
ANNEX.EPORT OF THE &quot;SPIVS&quot; AND &quot;DRONES&quot; WORKING- PARTYTo the Minister of Labour and National ServiceWe were asked by you to consider ways and means ofenlisting, in useful productive work the   people referred to as&quot;spivs&quot; and &quot;drones&quot; and also to consider the possibility of transferring to productive work some of those engaged in thegambling industry and in connection with sport.2. The &quot;Working Party consisted of representatives of theMinistry of Labour and National&apos; Service,  the Home Office,  theScottish Home Department, the Ministry of Pood and theAssistance Board.3&quot; The Working Party has&quot; held two meetings, one on22nd August and one on 29th August.     We now submit our report.k* We first considered the possibility of&quot; the registration of whole age groups, on the lines of the war-time-registrations, which is the only certain way of discoveringall those who are not engaged in any useful activity.     Wehave come to the conclusion that it would be quite impracticable to hold a series of comprehensive registrations of a largenumber of age groups of the population for the   purpose ofcatching the comparatively small number involved.     Suchregistrations of, say,  twenty age groups would need to extendover pretty well two years, including the checking afterregistration which would be essential, and v/ould involve an addition of 600-1,000 extra staff to the Ministry of Labour and national Service.     Anything short of the comprehensiveregistration of age groups,  (e.g. an obligation to register,placed on all persons following certain undesirable occupationsor doing nothing), would in practice be impossible of enforce-ment.      The persons we are looking for are the very people whowould evade the obligation to register on a wholesale scale and no machinery exists which v/ould enable a check to be imposed.in order to secure that everybody who had been requiredto register had in fact done so.4&quot;     We have accordinglyconsidered the best methods of dealing with the separate classesof the persons involved.5&quot;. &quot;Barrow-bovs&quot;..    We have come to the conclusionthat &quot;barrow-boys&quot; and other street traders could be controlledonly if there were a universal system of making street tradingby any individual within prescribed age limits dependent on acertificate from the Ministry of. Labour and National Serviceagreeing to his being so employed.     There is attached in theThe explanation of this is that if a whole age group of, say,300,000 men i&apos;s required to register, it is possible to check the registrations against- the National Register of over fortymillion cards as these contain particulars of age.      It is notpossible however to tell from the National Register the natureof the employment followed by individuals and it would not therefore be possible to ensure from a scrutiny of the NationalRegister that all men engaged in certain occupations or doing nothing had in fact registered at the Ministry of LabourOffices.
Appendix a note prepared on information supplied by the HomeOffice and the Scottish Home Department about the existing law in relation to licensing of street traders,  etc.     .It vailbe seen that it is clear that there is no power under the lawas it stands at present which would enable licensing to be administered on this basis..    We have considered whether theproblem could perhaps be met by invoking Defence Regulation 55but we are advised- that, this Regulation does not contain thenecessary powers.      We are forced,  therefore,  to the conclusion .that any system of licensing &quot;barrow-boys&quot; and other streettraders conditionally on their first submitting themselves tothe Employment Exchange for essential employment could be .operated only if new legislation were introduced.      the psychological effect of control-ling the activities of &quot;barrow-boys&quot; and the like is certainly of the utmost importance sincepeople seeking employment and thus bringing themselves withinthe labour controls would inevitably resent the freedom of others to follow less useful occupations without control andwould be less ready to submit, to control over their own employ-ment.      It should not, however, be overlooked that legislation will have to include all street traders and many of these are doing work as important in its way. as that performed by shop-keepers.     The sorting out of the &quot;spiv&quot; variety of street-trader could only be done when they pnesent themselves for a licence.6. Night.Clubs,  etc.     We have considered the questionof persons connected with night clubs,  amusement arcades,  etc.Here again it will be seen from the Appendix that under thepresent law it would not be possible to require such establish-ments to be licensed ,or registered subject to any form ofconsent of the Minister of Labour and National Service.Moreover, some of the least desirable of the night club typeof place are operated as &quot;bottle parties&quot; which would bedifficult to bring under control.     New legislation would benecessary if it were decided to control the employment ofpersons employed in or about- night clubs by means of a.licensing system in which there was a condition that no one should beemployed without the permission of the Ministry of Labour.Such legislation would have to apply to all clubs, leavingthose of the &quot;spiv&quot; variety to be sorted out in the course ofadministration.     We think amusement arcades can best bedealt with in connection with gambling.1* Gambling.    The football pools employ a. large numberof persons whose services might Very well be better utilised inthe national interest.     There is a gentlemen&apos;s agreement betweenthe pools and the Ministry of Labour and National Servicewhereby the pools undertake not to engage- young single girlsexcept after reference to an Employment Exchange.     This isnot working very effectively in the absence of-any power to insist on the girls taking other employment, but this will becured by the Control of Engagement Order.      That however onlydeals with new engagements and does not help to comb out existing staff.     Whatever restriction might be placed on the pools wouldinvolve a moral obligation&apos;to deal similarly.with bookmakers andtotalisators, and we think it essential - that all should betreated alike.      The most practicable method of control mightbe by a system of licensing pools, betting establishments, etc.with a condition attached that the employment- or continuedemployment of their staff must be subject to Ministry.of Labourand National Service approval.      Under the law as it standsthere is no power to impose any such system of licensing andany -proposal involving the licensing of football pools orbetting establishments would doubtless be ruled    out-on political grounds.
8. We suggest accordingly another method of dealingwith the gambling industry, viz. by.making use of defence regulation 58A(h).     This-Regulation-provides that the Ministerof Labour and Notional Service may, by. Order&apos;, make provisionfor regulating the &quot;engagement of workers by employers and the duration and situation of their employment and for giving effect to the &quot;foregoing provisions&quot; of Regulation 58A.The &quot;foregoing provisions&quot; include Article (l) which relates to the giving of directions.   . The Regulation specificallyprovides that persons.may be required-to register suchparticulars about themselves or the -persons employed by them as may be prescribed by or under the Order.     We are advised that it would-be possible for the Minister to make an order under this Regulation requiring certain classes or descriptions of - persons to register particulars about- themselves and thepersons employed by them.     If such an Order were made all employers covered by it could be required to render particularsabout themselves and their employees which would enable theMinistry of Labour and National Service to call either theproprietor or any employees for interview under defence regulation 80B with a view to giving a direction to performspecified services under Defence Regulation 58A(l).     Oneadvantage of this proposal is that- if the duty of registeringparticulars could be placed upon the principals in the industry it would be much easier to check non-compliance than it would if there were merely a limited registration order requiringemployees of certain classes or descriptions to registerparticulars of themselves.     The Football- Pools themselves andthe known betting establishments could quite easily be dealtwith under such an Order, but it must be recognised &apos; that- therewould be widespread evasion by the smaller establishments andparticularly by the one-man concerns which it would beimpossible to check systematically.     We suggest that if suchan Order is made it should if possible be so framed as tocover amusement arcades and the like where c. distinguishingfeature is the operation of gaming machines.9* Snort.-     The number of insured contributors employed ..in sport is about 12,000.      In view of this comparatively small number it is not thought to be reasonable to make a specialdrive to comb out people from this industry so long as thereis no intention of a general comb out from all the other less essential industries.     It is felt that employment   in sportmust be dealt with merely under the general control of newengagements.10. &quot;Drones&quot;.      We are,unable to devise any satisfactory method of compulsorily enlisting in important industry theservices of the &quot;drones&quot; - by which we mean those who are living, without work, on their own means, or on their parents&apos;means.     One possibility would be a compulsory registration of all unoccupied men and single women but the enforcement ofthis would we feel present insuperable difficulties.     For this type of restricted registration there would, as explained inparagraph h, be no means of tracing through the National Registerthose who had.failed to comply.      If it- were felt that somethingmust be done,  if only as a. gesture for its psychological effect,the only thing that- could be done would be to have such a-registration knowing full well that it would- be largelyineffective.     There is of course the risk that- it might- do more harm than good to impose a legal requirement which couldbe ignored without risk as there are no means of effectivelyenforcing it.
11. Directions.     It will be appreciated that in the caseof all the classes of persons mentioned in this report nothingworth while can be done unless the use of compulsory directions,may be applied more widely than was envisaged in the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement of 6th August.     That statement was tothe effect that directions would only be used in connectionwith the Control of Engagement Order applying to persons takingnew employment.     It would have to be extended to cover the-point that- directions are to be used for combing existingworkers out of certain classes of employment, and, if it were so decided,  for putting to work those who are doing nothing.12. &quot; Inflationary Pressure.      It seems to us that the  .root cause of many of the troubles for which we suggest  .remedies is the existence of the inflationary pressure whichencourages undesirable activities designed to extract money from the   public for which there is no sufficient normal outletin.the,purchase of consumer goods, in the ordinary market at reasonable prices.      If and when the inflationary pressurehas been relieved there can be no doubt that- many of these activities will disappear or at any rate will considerablydiminish.      The necessity for the temporary remedies which we propose seems to us to be largely attributable to this cause.13* Summary of Conclusions.      The points of policy for decision by Ministers are as follows:-f(l)    Should the power of direction be used not only inconnection with the control of Engagement Order but also for -(a) combing men and women out of undesirable streettrading;(b) combing men end women out of football- pools andother branches of the gambling industry;(c) combing men and women out of night club employment;(d) putting to work those who are not doing, any work?(2)    If so -(a) should there    be legislation to the effect that,irrespective of any existing law as to licensing,no one between certain ages shall engage in street-trading without a certificate that he has registeredf or employment at an Employment Exchange and that,he is not required for essential work?(b) should an Order be made under Defence Regulation 58Arequiring principals in the gambling industry to register particulars about themselves and their employees within certain ages?.(c) should there be legislation requiring that all employ-ment in clubs must be approved by the Ministry ofLabour,  despite the fact that all reputable clubsthroughout the country would have to be covered by itin order to deal with the comparatively small numberof night clubs and the like?(d) should there be a registration of all unoccupiedpersons within certain ages, despite the fact that itis likely to be widely evaded and  there would be no.effective means of tracing those who do not comply?
(3.)    Is it agreed that no further action should be taken with regard to persons already in employment in connection withsport?(Signed)    DOUGLAS CRAGGS,    (Signed)    H.H. WILES,Secretary. Chairman.29th August, 1947.APPENDIXNote prepared on information supplied by Home Officeand Scottish Home Department on (1)    Street and house to house trading,  (2;   Amusement arcades and (3) Nightclubs and bottle parties.1. Street and house to house trading is subject tocertain general Acts, of Parliament and also, in and aroundLondon and in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Greenock,  to certainlocal Acts.Apart from the provisions of the Children&apos;s and YoungPersons Acts which deal with street trading by persons under18,  the general Acts are the Pedlars Acts, 1871 and 1881, andthe Hawkers Act, 1888, which may broadly be said to apply to persons trading from houspe to house,  the Hawkers Act applyingwhere the hawker uses a horse or other beast of burden,  andthe Pedlars Acts where he travels on foot and without any suchbeast.     Thus, a man using a motor van is outside the scopeof this legislation.   - There are also exceptions for personsselling vegetables, fruit, fish, victuals or coal,  and theActs do not apply to,a hawker or pedlar who confines himself to trading in the street.A pedlar must obtain from the police an annualcertificate (fee:  5/- a year) which cannot be withheld if thepolice are satisfied that the applicant is of good characterend intends in good faith to carry on the trade of a pedlar.A hawker must obtain an annual excise licence (duty:  2 a year)and to do so must produce a. certificate signed by a clergymanand two householders,.or by a justice or a sergeant   orinspector of police,  that he is of good character and a properperson to be licensed.      The Commissioners of Customs and excise grant the licence automatically on production of the certificate and payment of the duty.The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1927?made street trading from stationary barrows,  etc.,  subject to&apos;annual licences (fee:  5/- a year)&apos; which may be granted by the
Metropolitan borough councils, and provided that the council could refuse a licence if on account of misconduct or forother sufficient reason the applicant is in their opinionunsuitable to hold such licence.      There are also provisions for limiting the number of licences, in any street, so as toprevent obstruction, and for limiting street trading to-particular- streets.     A licensee may employ other persons inhis business without further licence.      Similar provisions were subsequently included in local Acts applying to several suburbsoutside the County of London.      Within&quot;the County, the foregoing provisions have been extended by the L.C.C.  (General Powers)Act of this year to all street trading, except by licensedhawkers and certificated pedlars.. &apos; The Act includes protectiveprovisions for existing street traders.The Edinburgh Corporation Order,  1933* empowers theCorporation by byelaw to regulate street trading except the saleof^newspapers.      Byelaws have been made which require streettraders to obtain permits from the Chief Constable.     The glasgow corporation Act,  19h , also empowers the Corporation to makebyelaws for regulating street trading except the sale of coalor coke or newspapers.      The Byelaws may require permits forstreet trading and fix the conditions on which permits may begranted,  suspended or revoked, may determine times and places for street trading and may regulate the conduct of streettraders generally.      Similar provisions exist in the Greenock :Corporation Act, 1909.It is clear that the above provisions do not enablelicences and certificates to be made conditional on the consentof the Minister of Labour and neither Defence Regulation 55 nor58A are apt for amendment of the law to this effect.      Such an .amendment would be only partial in its effect, and would applydifferently in London County, in the suburbs outside the countywhere the local authority has licensing powers and in the restof the country.2. Amusement arcades.      Most of these places containgaming machines and are technically gaming houses, but the policedo not take action unless the element of gambling is more thantrivial.      A number of local Acts include provisions for byelawsregulating these places in specified respects, but only two Actsinclude licensing powers&apos;.      Of these, one is an old Act in force at Barrow-in-Furness, and the other is the Southend-on-SeaCorporation Act of this year.      At Barrow the Corporation hascomplete discretion:    at Southend they can refuse registrationif (inter alia) there are circumstances connected with theproprietor which in their opinion render his registration un-desirable.In Scotland section 397 of the Burgh Police (Scotland)Act,  1892, provides that no public show whether in open ground orin any house or building shall be opened without the permission of the magistrates who may make regulations for its conduct.Here again it seems probable that legislation would be needed to make it unlawful to work on one&apos;s own account or to employ.others in amusement arcades without the consent of theMinister of Labour.-
3* Night clubs and pottle parties.      Clubs sellingintoxicating liquor in England and Wales are required under thegeneral lav/ to be registered by&apos; the qlerk to the justices,and are liable to be struck off the register by the justicesif not properly conducted.     Under Defence Regulation 55Cthe police can object to registration on the ground that thereis no real need for the club.      In Scotland, however,registration is not automatic under the general law and d.R.55C does not apply.     in Scotland registration is notautomatic, and D.R.55C does not apply.     Applications for registration ore considered by the Sheriff, and may beobjected to on a number of grounds by the Police, the LocalAuthority, the Procurator Fiscal,  or anyone owning oroccupying property near the Club.      A certificate granted to aClub remains in force for one year only, but can be cancelledat any time by the Sheriff if objection is made to the way inwhich the Club is being conducted.Bottle parties, though subject to D.R.1+2C, which provides for the closure of undesirable premises, ingeniouslyevade all requirements as to registration of. clubs or licences for the sale of intoxicating liquor.Here again ligislation would be needed to makeexisting provisions for registration, subject to any form of -consent of the Minister of Labour.      Such a requirement would presumably have to apply to all clubs and would be highly controversial, whilst it would involve great complications tocover bo.ttle parties.
