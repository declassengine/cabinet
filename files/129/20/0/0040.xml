SECRET . - ,war .(47) 240 &apos; &apos;       COPY NO. ^25TH AUGUST.  1947CABINET .BALANCE OP PAYMENTS;   .INCREASED PRICES OP GAS AND ELECTRICITYMemorandum &quot;by Minister of Fuel and Power-   At the meeting on Balance of Payments on the 20th August,the: Lord President suggested that among other steps that mightbe taken in connection withthe present crisis we might increasethe price of gas and electricity.I have examined this matter and reached the conclusionthat in view of the fact that an increase in coal prices willbe- announced next&quot;week and that in due course this will be bound to result in the raising.of the price of gas in many places, no further action is called for on gas prices.     Wecould say, in racking any announcements on the economic positiongenerally, that there will be an increase in gas prices, hutit will not be possible to indicate the.magnitude&apos;or the timing of the increase, since they will not he known until the applications, of the various gas undertakings have been con-sidered and the accounts scrutinised.     On the whole, however,as this matter has so slight a bearing on the present situation do not feel that it is worth making public mention of it.The position of electricity is rather different for coalis relatively a much smaller item in&apos; the cost make-up and theelectricity undertakings are, in any event, in a stronger position to meet an increase in the cost of coal without having to apply to the Ministry of Fuel and Power for authority toincrease their prices.     There may be some applications for an*,    increase in d,omestic or other prices, but they are not likelyto be on a sufficient scale to justify an announcement thatthe price of electricity will be put up.I am, however, prepared to look into the question whether we should not seek an increase of the effective domestic priceof electricity&apos;by restrictions on the use of the two-parttariff.     This is a controversial proposal and further careful examination will be needed before any action can be taken,or any further public statement made.     I should, for one thing, wish to consult the British Electricity Authority.E.S.Mini s try of Pue1 and P owe r, S.W.1.25th August, 1947.IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)
