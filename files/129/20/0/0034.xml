prime MINISTER&apos;personal MINUTESerial No,   M.318/1+7MINIS TEROF FOODIt is most, important that the general statementsabout food outs which were made in the recent Debate,and the warnings of even greater sacrifices which willbe contained in the broadcast tomorrow, should betranslated into specific announcements as soon as possible,I should like to know what progress has been made towardsthe adjustment of food rationing, to meet the situation,and when you expect your plans to be complete.As to particular points, I should be glad to haveyour comments on the- following:-1) I understand that a general reduction In the monthly allocation of &quot;points&quot; has alreadybeen announced.     But the effect of this is general, and there would seem to be a case for an additional measure of discrimination against particular &quot;dollar&quot; foods, such asdried eggs, by raising their point values,2) When will the scheme for hotels and restaurants be ready?     And may I know what you propose?3) It has been suggested to me that since itis likely that the meat ration will have tobe cut in any case, except for heavy manual workers, it may be well to impose a reductionforthwith, while the warm weather makes thisless of a hardship than in the winter.     Ifthe position improved, the ration might be restored before the cold weather;    and if it became worse, the summer cut would at leastserve to reduce the severity of the cutwhich would otherwise be needed next winter.Perhaps you will let me have your views on.this.O.R.A.18th August. 1947
PRIME minister. Your minute&apos; Serial M.31 8/47.2. Until the results of the Washington talks are known and the negotiations on payment agreement with our principalsuppliers are completed (as foreseen by Ministers lost Sunday)the data are not available for a final answer on all thefood sacrifices which are required.     We have got the-situation,under close review from day to - day - indeed from hour to hour -in the closest consultation with the Treasury. - -3* On the assumption of. an early -announcement on thelines agreed last Sunday my immediate proposals are as follows.They answer your specific points.&quot;POINTS&quot; FOODS4* In addition to the reduction in the individual pointsallotment (32 to 28) we shall adjust the points values of the-various goods coming within the scheme on the basis of supplyand demand as we have done throughout.     We had anticipatedthe course of events to a certain degree already and hadadjusted points values upwards for a number of the hard currencyimports which will be coming into shorter supply.     Theremainder of the process will be completed and will.take effect from the rationing period commencing 14th September..      It isvery necessary that we should follow our normal practice ofmaking the announcement not earlier than the first day of the rationing period in order to.prevent serious disruption of thechain of distribution, e.g. a wild scramble in the shops coupled with withholding of supplies down the supply pipeline.HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS5* Hotels and restaurants obtain an allowance of rationedand controlled foods, including points foods, based on theactual number of meals served.      They do not use the ration booksof people who stay more than four nights:    the coupons in suchbooks are merely cancelled or cut out. &quot;6. People who stay in hotels for less than five nights atpresent obtain their full domestic rations in addition tomeals obtained while they are away from home.      Other mealstaken in restaurants form an addition to domestic rations for those living at home.7* -  The scheme for hotels and restaurants aims at avoiding the duplication of supplies of rationed foods so far as ispossible to the individual.      The proposed scheme provides for:
(a) the surrender-- of a proportion of the normalrations by those staying two to four nightsinclusive in a hotel;(b) a reduction in the-scale of allowances of rationedand controlled foods (including points foods) inrespect of meals served to non-residents in commercial catering establishments.8.       Hotel VisitorsPeople who stay five or more consecutive nightswill continue to surrender a complete week&apos;s rations.9* It is proposed to bridge the gap between one night and five nights by requiring visitors to surrender rations ifthey stay for two, three or four nights.      This will takea simple administrative form of cancelling and cutting outcoupons roughly proportionate to a week&apos;s rations of meat,bread and points.10. Expectant mothers and children under 5 years of agewill be excluded from the scheme.11.       Meals in RestaurantsOf the two possible alternatives -(a) the coupon system;    and(b) a straight cut in the scale of allowances;: &apos; )I have decided to accept the latter.     The coupon system wouldbe a tremendous burden on the public and the caterers andwould make heavy inroads into our available supply of manpower.12. The variety and nature of catering establishments isconsiderable and I am therefore proposing to apply the cutson the existing scale of allowances in two forms:(a) a straight cut of 20 per cent,  of all rationed andpoints goods except bread, milk and cooking fat;    or(b) 25 per cent,  of the meat, bacon, and,ham, cheeseand points.13* The reduction in allowances will not apply to industrial canteens, or staff dining rooms for other workerswhich are not available to the public,  or to schools and institutions (e.g. hospitals,  etc.)    The reduction will also not apply in respect of meals for visitors staying In anhotel who will, under the existing and new regulations, havesurrendered a proportionate port of their domestic ration.14. The details of these two proposals are at present being discussed with representatives of the Trades UnionCongress and the catering trade associations.      I shall be ableto come to a decision this month and it is my intention tobring it Into force on 1hth September - this date beingselected as the beginning of an eight weekly permit ^period.An announcement can be made on Monday.
 U^I^MEATJRATION15* I agree there should he an early cut. in the meat ration of twopence and I would propose to introduce it from1hth September, but I can make the announcement immediatelyI have your approval. At the present moment it is notpossible to say whether the cut is sufficient or whether onthe other hand it may be possible to restore the cut duringthe worst winter months.16. I propose to apply the cut to all consumers alike.As you know there is already in existence a limited form ofdifferential rationing,  e.g. the&apos; extra meat ration for miners,additional rations for seamen, seasonal allowances foragricultural workers and herring fishermen, the extra cheeseration for agricultural workers and the liberal additional allowance of meat in industrial canteens for certain classesof heavy workers and for manual workers. &apos;*17* When the cut is announced we could also announce thatif it is not possible to restore the cut in the winter and if further cuts in staple rations are necessary, an extensionof the present system of differential rationing will probablybe introduced.      We are working in close and urgent consultationwith the Ministry of Labour on the definition of &quot;the preferenceclasses but printing of new ration documents alone would prevent the introduction of a new differential rationing schemefor two or three months either in relation to this projectedcut in the meat ration or on a wider scale covering severalcommodities.18. I am not limiting myself to these proposals as Ishall have further suggestions to make as the situationdevelops.19, I am sending a copy of this minute to the lord president of the Council.JOHN STRACHEY21st August,  19U7. &apos;
