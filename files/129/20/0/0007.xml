HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF&quot; HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret .2.(k7)  207 -18TH JULY.  19U7CABINET-REDUCTION OP PETROL CONSUMPTIONMemorandum by the Minister of transport in his memorandum (CP.(1+7) 206) the Minister of fuel and Power puts forward the following proposals forsecuring a reduction of 500,000 tons in the import of motor spirit in. 191+7/1+8 - ^(a) -a cut of 33-3- per cent, in the basic ration for private cars, estimated to yield 300. OOP ton,s;(b) an effective cut of 5 per cent, in the issuesmade by the Ministry of Fuel and Power torecipients of supplementary allowances for usein private cars! and motor cycles,&apos; taxis,, hirecars and miscellaneous, estimated to yield100.000 tons.This would leave 100,000 tons to be provided. fromother sources, i.e..; commercial vehicle and public servicevehicle operators,, agricultural and. industrial users.   - some minor contribution may possibly be&quot; made by the Services andthe Control Commission for Germany.2. In the case.of pu,public&apos; service vehicles (omnibuses-and coaches) there is little room for economy.     Consumption byholiday excursions: and tours Is only of the order of 30,000tons per annum and practically ceases at the end of the summer-season.   &apos; Any substantial cut in this consumption would havean effect on ,the public disproportionate to the amount of the saving effected.     Apart from this holiday .traffic, consumption by public service vehicles cannot bo cut to any material extentwithout causing inconvenience or actual, hardship to workers.There is in fact still considerable&apos;&quot; pressure to increaseservices,  and some increased mileage may be necessitated by thestaggering of hours of work..    All that can be done here    is tocall for voluntary economy, .-which may yield some saving,  thoughit will be small.3* As regards goods vehicles,  any cuts which had theeffect of restricting the movement of goods to any appreciable-extent would interfere with the economic life of the country.Normally,goods are moved only as a matter of necessity.     Retaildeliveries &apos;could, &quot;it is true, be cut without interference with industry, but it is common knowledge that they are by no mernson a luxurious scale,&apos; and any restriction would be likely&apos; to cause public resentment.     During the war there were zoningschemes,  since discontinued, for many commodities which effectedOOPY NO.
economies in transport, and in general goods were not accepted for. road transport if they could&apos;go. by roil or. other means.Recently the tendency has been the other way.     Goods have beenshifted from rail to- road because of the priority of movementaccorded to coal- traffic and economies in the consumption ofcoal by the railways, the effects of which are accentuated bythe exhausted state of railway equipment owing to the war.During the winter months the prospects are.that the transport system as a whole will hardly be adequate to cope with thedemands of traffic.     The tendency therefore will be towards anincrease rather than a reduction in the consumption of fuel for;the movement of goods by road.Ii. The Minister of Fuel and Power suggosts in his paper that there is a considerable &quot;black market&quot; in motor fuel,obtained through the over-issue of fuel coupons&apos; to commercialusers.     I have no doubt that this &quot;black market&quot; exists, butI have no means of. ascertaining   its extent.     Even,the comparatively stringent rationing system employed during&apos; thewar could not altogether prevent some leakage of this kindbecause it is impracticable to estimate exactly the amount of fuel required by a goods vehicle of any particular type for a given mileage.     Consumption varies according to weather conditions,  the type of road traversed,  the state of repair ofthe vehicle,  etc. ;Since the war the rationing system has been muchmodified with a view to simplification and saving of staff,and the efforts of my officers have necessarily been directedrather to seeing that issues to individual firms v/ere not substantially increased, without good reason than to check indetail the actual use made of the fuel issued.     At the sametime I should make it clear, that fuel coupons for, goods vehicles are not to be had for the asking.5. In order to reduce the black market traffic in commercial coupons.I have agreed with the Minister of Fuel and power that measures should be taken for enabling coupons tobe traced back to the operator to whom they v/ere   issued.6. I am also prepared to agree to an&apos;initial cut of5 per cent, of issues of fuel to operators of goods vehicleswith a view to providing a check on over-issues.      Some200,000 operators are involved, however, and a high proportionof these will have a good case for a restoration, of the cut inorder to maintain the movement of goods.     If, as I expect, thereare in consequence a very large number of applications forthis purpose, it will not be practicable for the existing staff to check effectively more.than a small fraction of them.      If afull cut of 5 per cent, were realised the saving would be some80,000 to 90,000 tons., but in practice nothing like this figure is likely to be realised.A.B.Ministry, of Transport, S.W. 1.,18th July,&apos; I9I47.    -
