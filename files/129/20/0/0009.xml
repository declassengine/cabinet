; .      109(THIS DOCUMENT &apos;IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.p.(hi) 209 .22ND JULY.  19h7CABINETGERMANYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs wish to consult my colleagues on the two following questions(i)    The revised plan for the German Level of industry    and(ii)    The treatment of the Anglo-American Zone under the marshall Plan.1*     The Level of Industry.   The French Government haveprotested vigorously against the projected Anglo-american agreement on the Level of Industry for the Bi-zonal Area.It is clear that if we and the Americans were to proceed atthis moment to approve and publish the Agreement concludedor virtually concluded in Berlin by General Robertson andGeneral Clay, not only would the French Government be facedwith a vevy difficult internal situation leading perhaps to their resignation, but the success of the Paris Conference&quot;Would be gravely threatened and Indeed the whole Marshallplan might well collapse.    On the other hand to postpone thecoming into force of the Level of Industry plan obviouslyhas serious disadvantages from the German point of view.    the reaction-on the German political situation and on Germanmorale will be very bad, the hoped for improvement in Germanindustrial production will not materialise and our chances of being able to carry out an effective programme of delivery of plants.as reparations in the near future will be prejudiced.I feel, however, that,, the balance of * advantage lies in-favourof doing what we can to meet, the French.    I am confirmed in this view by the knowledge that although the united StatesGovernment have not yet expressed any final, view,Mr. Marshall&apos;s initial reaction is in favour of suspendingaction on the Level of Industry plan for the time being andoffering to discuss the whole question with the FrenchGovernment.I therefore ask authority to propose to Mr. Marshallthat the United Kingdom and United States Governments shouldjointly .inform the French Government that -(i)    nothing further will be done in the directionof implementing the Level of Industry planuntil the beginning of September;COPY NO, . w/.
(ii)    in the interval the United States and united Kingdom Governments&apos;, although theys &apos; cannot concede that France, Hot being partyto the Fusion Agreement has an equal rightwith themselves to determine the Level ofIndustry in the Bi-zonal Area, will beprepared to consider any representationsthat the French Government may care to make to them on the subject of the Level ofIndustry plan; &apos;(iii)    in these circumstances and in view of thedesirability of doing nothing to complicate the work of the Paris Conference it ishoped that the French Government, shouldthoy wish to raise any questions aboutthe Level of Industry plan, will do so&apos;direct with the United States and united Kingdom Governments and not atthe Conference.We should also suggest to the United States Governmentthat, the British and American Commanders-in-Chief should be instructed that when replying to any questionnaires they may receive from, the Paris Conference, they should base theiranswers on the new Level of Industry plan.    (-This is inaccordance with the preliminary views of the1 State Department.)Should any questions be asked at the Conference it wouldbe explained that if any cogent points should be raised.atthe Conference concerning the contribution which germany might make to European recovery or the needs of othercountries from Germany, these would certainly be taken intoaccount before the Level of Industry plan was finalised.2.     Germany and the Marshall Plan.    The United kingdom delegation in Paris have asked how Western Germany is to betreated in connexion with the European ReconstructionConference - i. e. whether Western Germany should be broughtinto the programme as if it were a full participatingcountry or whether it should be looked at primarily from thepoint of view of the extent to which it can contribute to theneeds of other countries.   The question is a delicate one,since any suggestion that German reconstruction is beingfavoured in.preference to that of the other countries is bound to cause resentment among the Allies.    It is clearlymost important that nothing should be done which might lendforce to the allegation now being spread abroad by theRussians that the main object of the Marshall plan is tobuild up Germany.    On the other hand from the practical point of view the only satisfactory way of -dealing with western Germany would seem to be to integrate its requirements and resources in the programme in exactly thesame way as those of the ordinary participating countries.This seems necessary not only in the general interest andto- ensure that Western Germany is enabled to play her full part in contributing to the recovery of Europe, but toprotect the particular interest of this country anddiminish the present drain on our financial resources.    Itwould&apos;also have a good political effect in Germany.    TheUnited States Government are generally of the opinion thatWestern Germany&apos;s resources and requirements should certainly be ascertained and brought into the. general picture, though they seem to haye no definite views as to whether thisshould be done in exactly the same manner as in the case ofthe other countries.
illI therefore suggest that the united Kingdom delegation in Paris should be instructed to do what they can to ensurethat Western Germany is treated on the same basis as theother countries.   They should, however, be careful to makeit clear -that they are doing so for purely practical reasons and because this seems to be the best way of ensuring that  .Germany can- play her full part in contributing to thereconstruction of Europe.    The Delegation should be at pains to emphasise throughout that His Majesty&apos;s Government haveno intention of allowing Germany to be given a.ny preferenceover other countries.(intld.)
