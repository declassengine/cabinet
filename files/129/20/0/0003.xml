(47) 20315^ July, 1947CABINETPROPOSAL TO CHARGE WAY-LEAVES FOR OIL PIPE-LINES INPALESTINEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should like to support the recommendation in the Colonial Secretary&apos;sMemorandum (OP. (47) 198) that the right of the Palestine Government to makecharges for pipe-line facilities should be approved in principle.Palestine, whatever its future, will need revenue for economic development and I think that the oil companies who in the future obtain the right to laypipe-lines across Palestine should make a contribution to the revenues ofPalestine. Moreover, the other States through which new pipe-lines are to passpropose to charge for way-leaves and there therefore seems to be no reason whythe Government of Palestine should not do the same.E. B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1,15th-July, 1947.
