THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF   HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1947Copy No.   ^ XCABINETPRIZE MONEYJoint Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretaryof State for air the decision to grant prize money in respect of the proceeds derived fromthe sale of captured enemy merchant ships and cargoes for the benefit of theNavy and the Royal Air Force was announced by the then First Lord of theAdmiralty in the House of Commons on 19th December, 1945. This decisionhad been reached in consultation with the Prime Minister and the Chancellorof the Exchequer, who were aware of the Admiralty&apos;s desire to make an individualdistribution to members of the Navy and of the possibility that the Air Ministrymight wish to devote its share to suitable R.A.F. charities. Further investiga-tion has shown that, although the actual grant will be made by His Majesty inthe exercise of his prerogative, there are several new features, some of themrequiring legislation, which it is desirable to bring to the notice of the. Cabinet.2. An outline of the Prize Bill which it is proposed to introduce early inthe 1947-48 session is contained in the Annex.3. The following are among the features which distinguish the proposedgrant of prize money resulting from the recent war from the grants made duringor after former wars :-(a) The historical procedure has been for the appropriate prize courts tocondemn prize proceeds as Droits of the Crown (the disposal ofwhich is a matter for His Majesty) and1 Droits of Admiralty (which on former occasions have accrued to the United Kingdom Exchequer).During the 1914-18 war, for the first time, these Droits were notdistinguished by the courts on condemnation. A Naval Prize Tribunalwas set up by Act of Parliament in 1918 to distinguish the Droits inrespect of all ships and cargoes seized, and the resulting Droits ofthe Crown were granted by His Majesty to the Navy. During therecent war the courts have not distinguished between the Droits,, andit is hoped to avoid the delays which would be caused by setting upa Prize Tribunal at this stage.(6) The Royal Air Force is for the first time to share prize money with theNavy. The Admiralty and Air Ministry are in consultation over theirrespective shares.(c) The Air Ministry have decided to dispose of the R.A.F. share to a centralfund or funds for the benefit of Air Force Charities or Air ForceWelfare. The Admiralty has decided to adhere fairly closely to the precedent of the 1914-18 war and to distribute to officers and men ofthe Navy who have qualified by reason of six months&apos; service afloat.The Naval distribution will be on a scale approximating to the scaleadopted for war gratuity.(d) The status of the Dominions has materially changed since the last prize -distribution.    In consequence it must in the last resort be for theGovernments of the Dominions, India and Burma to decide how to dispose of those portions of prize money which may justly be regarded[33989]SECRETCP. (47) 21628th July, 1947
as earned by the activities of their Naval and Air forces. these governments must also be regarded as having a claim to a portionof the Droits of Admiralty.4. By agreement reached in 1940 Empire Governments have held the proceeds of prize and borne the expenditure in relation to prize proceedingsinstituted in their courts with a view to distribution of the net balance at theend of the war upon a basis to be agreed. It has accordingly been suggested tothese Governments in agreement with the Treasury that, on final estimation of thetotal net proceeds of prize in all Empire courts, two-thirds of the sum shall beregarded as Droits of the Crown for disposal by individual Governments for thebenefit of members of their Naval and Air forces on such basis as seems best to each country. The proportion suggested is approximately the same as thatwhich resulted after the 1914-18 war from the decisions of the Naval PrizeTribunal on the allocation of the Droits. The total sum (Le., both Droits) will be divided amongst the Governments concerned in the ratio of peak numbers in therespective Naval and Air forces during the 1939-45 war. Each Government will thus receive a sum consisting as to two-thirds of Droits of the Crown availablefor grant to the forces and as to one-third of Droits of Admiralty available tothe Exchequer.Colonial Sailors and Airmen will qualify for exactly the same benefits asthe United Kingdom forces and will be dealt with under the same arrangements.5. Until returns in a common form are received from Empire prize courts,ho exact estimate can be made of the total proceeds of prize. It is thought,however, that the total will lie between  8 million and  9 million, of which, underthe above arrangements, up to  6 million would become available for the benefitof the Naval and Air forces of the Empire. It will therefore be clear that individual shares in the United Kingdom Naval distribution will be only a fraction of the amount received after the 1914-18 war, when about  15 million was distributed to the Navy alone.6. Some further delay is inevitable before the grant can be made byHis Majesty on account of the necessity of awaiting the concurrence of empire governments and the final returns from their prize courts. If, however, the PrizeBill is passed early in the next session, it is hoped that it will be possible toproceed with the grant during the course of 1948. On the last occasion it wasonly possible to begin the prize distribution in 1920 because the necessary preparations had been begun long before the war ended. The distribution wasnot completed until 1923.7. We seek authority for the introduction of a Prize Bill on the lines proposed early in the next Session.P. N-B.28th July, 1947.
313?annex the Prize Bill should contain less than half a dozen clauses, which willrequire to include the following points :-&apos;(a) There is no authority under which prize money can be disposed of otherwise than to the actual members of the forces who served duringthe war when the prize captures were made. Legislation is thereforerequired for a grant to be made to R.A.F. charitable and welfarefunds to be used for the benefit inter alia of Air Force personnel whowere not serving at the time of the captures.(6) As the amount of Droits of the Crown has not been determined by legalprocess, the Bill should declare as Droits of the Crown a fixed sum,which is now being estimated by Departments concerned in consulta-tion with the Governments of the Dominions, India and Burma.Alternatively the Bill could authorise the Chancellor of the exchequer to fix a fair sum as Droits of the Crown in consultation with these governments and Departments.(c) The Prize Deposit Account does not include the values of shipsrequisitioned out of prize by Government Departments. It may therefore be insufficient to cover the amount estimated to be Droits ofthe Crown. The Bill should provide that the sums due to the prize fund and the participating Governments shall be met from the PrizeDeposit Account, or, in so far as the monies in that account are insufficient for this purpose, from monies provided by Parliament insuch manner as the Treasury may direct.(d) Distribution of prize money to the Navy must take place according tothe provisions of the Naval Agency and Distribution Act, 1864. under sections 17 and 19 of this Act, percentage payments must be made out of the proceeds of all prizes and out of all grants to the royal navy, both to ships&apos; agents and to a Naval Prize Cash Balance, whichultimately reverts to the Exchequer. Ships&apos; agents did not undertakeprize duties in either of the last two wars, and the Naval Prize Act,1918, provided that the above-mentioned sections of the 1864 Actshould not apply to the distribution made after the 1914-18 war. Itis desirable to repeat this provision.(e) There is likely to be an undistributed residue of Naval prize moneyconsisting of forfeited and unclaimed shares and other balances. TheBill must provide for the disposal of this residue, either to increasethe distributable total or to be granted for welfare purposes.(/) Provision must be made on the lines of Section 4 of the Naval Prize Act,1918, to avoid difficulties which might otherwise arise over the repre-sentation of deceased persons.(g) The Bill should authorise the disposal of those portions of prize proceedswhich accrue to the Governments of the Dominions, India and Burma,whether for the benefit of the Naval and Air forces of these Govern-ments or for retention by the Exchequers.ih) There should be a saving clause for the prerogative on the lines ofSection 5 (2) of the Naval Prize Act, 1918.
