HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)SECRET -G.?.(k7)  206 COPY NO.  Jl18TH JULY.  iqU7CABINET-    REDUCTION OF PETROL CONSUMPTIONMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel arid power at their meeting on 2b,. th June (CM. (1+7) 56thConclusions, Minute 5)  the Cabinet decided that it shouldbe our aim to effect a reduction of 500,000 tons in the import of motor spirit in I9I+7/I48.      I fear that this can only beachieved by a reduction in civilian consumption, since (a) stock of motor spirit in the country, including stocks held by theService Departments, have fallen to under 600,000-&apos;tonsrepresenting under six weeks&apos; current consumption,  so that,far from its being possible.to reduce stocks, it is urgently necessary that we should build them up at the first opportunity;and (b) the scope for economies by the Service Departments islikely to be small.     The question of whether economies can bemade by the Control Commission in Germany is also being examinedbut the amount of such economies could not be expected to be substantial.2. If we are to reduce our imports of motor spirit by500,000 tons in 1911-7/1+8 we must reduce the basic ration, firstbecause this field offers the largest scope for economy,  endsecondly, because we could hardly apply a cut to business,professional and commercial users and at the same time leavethe private motorist untouched.     A further point is that whenrelaxations were made in the scales of petrol rations lastAugust, this category (private motorists)  enjoyed a larger increase (50 per cent.)  than motorists in the more essentialcategories.3* If the basic rat-ion were reduced at the end of the holiday season, i.e. 1st October,  from its present levelrepresenting approximately sufficient petrol to motor 270 milesa month,  to the level which was ruling last July, representingapproximately sufficient petrol to motor 180 miles a month,i.e. by 33&quot;? per cent.,  theoretically this would save 300,000tons in a - full year.^4-* t 1 say &quot;theoretically&quot; since we- should not achieve this saving unless black market operations in petrol can becurbed.      It is generally agreed the t one of the principalways in which the black market gets its petrol is by theencashment of coupons which it obtains from commercial vehicle-operators whose applications for legitimate business are not so closely scrutinised as previously owing to simplification of. the-system of issues to save staff.      The Minister of Transport isdealing with this point in his paper (C.P.(l4-7) 207). -
1015V To achieve our object it will therefore be necessary(a)    to reduce the total amount of coupons issued for the useof commercial vehicles, and (b)    to arrange that such couponscan in any case be traced when they are found in the wronghands.     My Department has made suggestions, which it believeswould be effective,   to the Ministry of Transport who are the responsible authorities in the case of commercial vehicles.6. The cut 03? 33^ per cent, in the basic ration,  evenif made effective by the control of coupons issued to commercialhauliers would, however, still leave us short of the targetmentioned by the Cabinet of 200,000 tons a year less suchsaving as con be made by the Services and the Control Commission.To cover this gap would involve securing an overall net cut ofabout 5 per.cent, in coupons issued to other users of petrol,e,g.  recipients of supplementary allowances for use in private cars and motor cycles,  taxis,  hire cars and commercial vehicleoperators.     I do not feel that   in these cases any voluntaryscheme would be effective.     As regards issues for publicservice vehicles,  agricultural or industrial purposes, while would not propose a definite cut,  I shall call for anyvoluntary economies that can be made and feel that we can reasonably count on some saving.7. As there will inevitably be cases where the cutswill have to be replaced on appeal, I feel that the only wayof securing a net cut of 5 per cent, would be to imposeinitially a larger gross cut.      I had originally thought ofan initial cut of 10 per cent, and as regards consumers coming within the scope of my Department&apos;s rationing system,(supplementary allowances, taxis, hire cars and miscellaneous)I do not think: that this would offer any administrative difficulties.     An effective 5 per cent, saving by theseconsumers should&apos; bring the total saving up to ij00,000 tons ayear, leaving about 100,000 tons to be found mainly from commercial users.     As regards the   issue of coupons to commercial vehicle operators, whose consumption for 19h7/^4-8is estimated at about 1,800,000 tons, the Ministry of transport are of the opinion that with the present&apos;and   prospective stateof the railways,,  it would be impossible to impose,  even initially,a cut of 10 per cent, without seriously affecting the movementof goods but expect to be able to make a substantial economy.I believe that the Minister of Transport will be elaboratingthis point.8, All in all, I think we should achieve a cut of500,000 tons in a full year by the measures suggested above,combined with an appeal to the public to avoid all unnecessaryuse of petrol.     It will, however,.for administrative reasons,hardly be possible to start securing much economy until thebeginning of October.9. I should make it clear that all references to &quot;cuts&quot;refer to cuts on our original supply programme for 19h7/h8which was itself in the aggregate about 600,000 tons more thanwhat was actually consumed in the year 19h7/h7*      This increase is due to the increasing number of private cars, motor cycles,end commercial vehicles that are coming on the road.     The&quot;cuts&quot; do not,   therefore, represent reduction in consumption at its current rate,  but the elimination of the increase which wewould have expected on the basis of existing circumstances&apos; andconditions.10. The Cabinet included a proviso to their decision to
102the effect that elaboration of the existing petrol rationing scheme should be avoided.     My belief is that the schemessuggested above would not produce such elaboration.     TheMinistry of Transport have stated that introduction of themeasures suggested will undoubtedly involve some increase intheir staff..     On the.   other hand, I am able- to make asubstantial reduction in the number of.people absorbed bypetrol rationing by increasing the period covered byapplications for supplementary allowances from four monthsas at present to six months.     Once through this transitional period, this should make it possible to reduce the number ofstaff employed on petrol rationing by my Department from1,770 as at the beginning of the year and 1,580 as at to-day to approximately 1,300.ID.
