THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of..............-^-^TOP secret copy No.CP.(47)  2244TH AUGUST, 1947CABINETSTATEMENT ON FOOD IMPORTS:,for parliamentary DEBATE ON bTH.AUGUST.  1947Memorandum by the Minister of food.     At their meeting on 1st August (CM.(47) 67th Conclusions,Minute 2, Conclusion (9)) the Cabinet agreed that in thestatement to be made on food imports in the House on the 6thAugust it should be stated that the Government felt it essentialthat there should be a saving on food purchases from hard currency sources and that they were planning to save somethingof1 the order of  12 million a month at present prices.     Itwas also agreed to say that we propose to cease importingluxury foods and that every effort would be made to obtainalternative supplies of essential foods from soft currencysources.     Conclusion (9) further went on to say that in thestatement in the House the Prime Minister should say that therewould have to bo adjustments of points values, that it&apos;would bedifficult to-&apos;avoid some reduction in basic rations and that,if Such reductions had to be madoj the Government would intro-duco c. differential rationing, scheme.2,     The Prime Ministers statement giving effect to conclusion (9) will be of particular importance to my Depart-ment as it will, in fact, determine our buying policy in theperiod immediately ahead.     I very much hope that the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement will be on some such lines as thefollowing, so that my Department may have the necessary freedom to buy any additional food available in soft currency areas,while at the same time any direct challenge to Article 9 of theLoan agreement is avoided.     It is also important that the.statement should give us reasonable freedom to maintain orchange rations as the situation demands.&quot;We have decided that we must make an immediate and substantial reduction in our purchases of food from hard currency sources.     We have therefore given instructions whichwill make a reduction:in the rate of these purchases of theorder of  12 million a month.     Such a reduced rate of buyingfrom hard currency sources will mean that, we shall completelystop the buying from those sources of anything which could beremotely considered luxury foods.      Our bulk, long term contracts for staple foodstuffs from these areas will not, ofcourse, be interfered with.     But for the present we mustlargely confine ourselves to such purchases as far as hard currency sources are - concerned.
&quot;The House will wish to know what effect this, decision will &quot;be likely to have upon our level of distribution of food-stuffs in the coming months.     That will depend upon a numberI        of factors.     In the first place it will depend upon the degree to which we are able to buy our foodstuffs from softcurrency sources.     In so far as these soft currency sourcesare, all things considered, more favourable from thecommercial point of view the question of discrimination underArticle 9 of the Loan agreement will not of course arise.Where, however, such purchases cannot be justified under theterms of the Loan agreement, we shall he exploring thesituation immediately-with tne United States Government to see what steps can &quot;be taken to enable us to obtain supplies fromsoft currency areas.     The second factor which will determine the effect of the. Government&apos; s decision upon our rations is naturally that of how long this policy will have to bemaintained.&quot;It will be necessary at once to increase the pointsvalue of some of the so-called luxury foods, for they are largely distributed under the points scheme.     As to &quot;basicrations, we shall do everything in our power to maintainthem, though we shall not take risks with our stocks.     Ifrations have to be reduced as a result of the policy outlined,then the Government will introduce a differential rationing scheme designed to give preference to heavy manual workers,and preparations will be made forthwith against this contingency.     Restrictions on consumption in restaurantsand hotels will in any case be imposed forthwith,&quot;J.S,Ministry of Pood, S.W.1&apos;.     . (1+TH AUGUST, 191+7
