(THIS IS T-S PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)      243SECRET22-CP. (47) 257 .COPY no&quot;22ND AUGUST.- 1947-CABINET  .ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES FOR THE EMERGENCYNote by the Lord President of the Councillo   , The crisis calls for an overhaul of ourmachinery and methods in the economic sphere.      Lack ofconfidence in these is manifest in the Press?  and Ianticipate growing pressure for public explanations.2o Public Service Manpower.The crisis will impose extra burdens on theCiyil Service in various directions-      A further increasein the size of the Service would be indefensible.      the target published in the Economic Survey was for a reduction to 23 050^,000 by the end of 1947-      The present figure is2.j 1483 00C      I do not think we can face allowing this target to be perhaps the only one to be substantially ^.exceeded.      I suggest that the Home Secretary&apos;s Committeebe, invited to look at this matter again so far as theCivil Service element is concerned and to arrange with ministers for an adequate number of less urgent measures and tasks to be postponed, even if the public has to be told that certain assurances previously given cannot nowbe carried out owing to the crisis. -   This load sheddingshould be on a sufficient scale to enable the end-yeartarget to be achieved after making full allowance for extra burdens arising from the crisis.I suggest that on this basis the Minister ofHealth and the Secretary of State for Scotland should press strongly for a corresponding reduction in localgovernment personnel.      It might be useful for theOrganisation and Methods Branch of the Treasury to examinethe complaint that central Departments are forcing excessivework cn local authorities by asking for unnecessarily detailed and comprehensive statistical and other returns*     We mayhave to tell Parliament that owing to manpower economiescertain questions cannot be answered.3&quot; Departmental Arrangements.It will be necessary for some time to come forDepartments to be equipped to take prompt executive actionbeyond their usual fields.      Ministers should satisfy themselves that all necessary measures have been taken toenable their Departments to co-operate effectively andpromptly on operational matters with the Central economic planning Staffs   and with representatives of industry and^others concerned,,  in such matters as progressing deliveries,and dealing with bottlenecks in product-ion.
I suggest that the manpower and expenditure involved in current international meetings,  especially ofUolio  and its agencies,,  is (a) much greater than we - can affordc,and (b) much greater than the results warrant.      In my paper(Cop. (46)416) of 6th November last I proposed that ministers should be invited to use every possible effort to minimise the number of questions not of strategic importance forwinning the peace which were placed on the agenda for international discussion.      This view was supported by theCabinet (CoM.(lf6) 95th&apos; conclusions Minute 2)-     Nevertheless-relatively inessential meetings go merrily on involving agreat diversion of effort from more urgent practical tasks-.I- suggest that:(a) the&apos; Official Steering Committee on international Organisations be instructedto produce a list of those scheduledinternational meetings the postponement ofwhich would seriously embarrass orinconvenience Ho Mo Go ;(b) our representatives should be instructedto press for the indefinite postponementowing to the crisis of all projectedmeetings not on this list;    and(c) the Official Steering Committee on international Organisations should arrange to screen representation at meetings&apos; and conferences which cannot be postponed., with aview to securing a 50$ reduction in thenumbers taking part5  as compared withcomparable functions in the first half year.5&quot; Allocatiens MachineryoI think there is room for further streamlining ofthe work of materials allocations.      In the new circumstances propose to review with Mr.  Gaitskell whether at any rate asimplification could not be securedo60  Joint Machinery with Industry?It appears to me that there is duplication and delay in the working side by side of three general tripartitebodies representative of Governments  employers and tradeunions - the Economic Planning Board;  the National ProductionAdvisory Council on Industry and the National Joint AdvisoryCouncil.      I propose that henceforward the preparation of alladministrative schemes (e..g.  for longer hours, . stagger ing9 etc.)should be carried out by Departments concerned under the guidance of the Planning Board for submission to and  .ratification where necessary by the N.J.A. C  or the N.P.A.C 1*where appropriate, except where these schemes are substantiallywithin the Departmental jurisdiction of the Minister of Labourand the President of the Board of Trade respectively.Jo  Balance of Payments.The need for strengthening of the machinery in this field has already been discussed by Ministers (C M* (k-J)J1stConclusions,. Minute 1)-   ,
8o Fiscal measures as a means&apos; of implementing -planning..I attach great importance to the closest- linkbeing, maintained between the Chief Planning Officer andthe Treasury to ensure that the requirements of planningare fully appreciated and taken into account in the.formulation of advice to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on general policy.9&quot; Manpower Distribution.I cannot&apos; discover that there is any adequatemachinery functioning by which the distribution of manpower,particularly in relation to Service claims and the .undermanned industries, is being correctly kept under review at the centre.      I propose that the Minister of Labour should arrange for his officers to review these arrangements- inconsultation with the Chief Planning Officer and the ChiefEconomic Information Officer,  and to report as a matterof urgency.10. Progressing of Decisions.There are many decisions other than the decisionsof major Ministerial Committees which are liable not to befollowed up.      I suggest that the Secretary of the cabinet should examine the arrangements,  other than those for whichthe Cabinet Office takes direct responsibility,  and ensurethat the arrangements for progressing and follow-up are-adequate to the needs of the ^emergency.11. I have outlined above some points on which the. existing machinery can be,  or is in course&quot;of being,  improved.When sufficient progress has been made I propose toundertake a comprehensive review of the machinery for economic planning and co-ordination and will,  if necessary,arrange for the circulation of a further Cabinet paper.(Initialled) Ho MoPrivy Council Office,  S.W.I.   ..22ND AUGUST,
