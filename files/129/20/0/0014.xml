(47) 44th Conclusions, Minute 3), theCabinet agreed in principle that, before the railways come under public owner-ship, their charges should be increased in order to meet the full cost of their operation, including any increase in cost due to the concession of any part ofthe claims for shorter working hours or higher wages; and that I should aim at bringing the necessary increase in charges into operation by 1st October, 1947.2. I submitted recently to the Lord Presidents Committee a paper(Annex I) reviewing the position and recommending increases in the charges ofthe Railway Companies.3. At their meeting on 18th July (L.P. (47) 22nd Meeting, Minute 1), theLord Presidents Committee invited the Lord President to arrange for officials of the Departments concerned and of the Economic Section of the Cabinet Officeto prepare a memorandum showing what increases in railway charges would bring the railway revenue and expenditure most nearly into balance with theleast possible detriment to the national economy. A paper collating the opinions of the Departments concerned was prepared by the Paymaster-General(Annex II).4. At their meeting on 25th July (L.P. (47) 23rd Meeting, Minute 5) theLord Presidents Committee approved, for submission to the Cabinet, increase Dshown in the Appendix to Annex I, i-e- &apos; (i) Railway charges to 55 per cent, above pre-war. *(ii) At railway docks, certain charges on coastwise ships and their cargoesto 25 per cent, above pre-war; all other charges to 75 per centrabovepre-war.5. I seek authority to announce in the House of Commons before the Recessthat these increases will be brought into operation on 1st October next. I submitin Annex III a draft announcement for approvalA.

ANNEX I[L.P. (47) 12016th July, 1947]cabinet lord Presidents CommitteeADJUSTMENT OF CHARGES OF CONTROLLED RAILWAYCOMPANIESMemorandum by the Minister of transport in L.P. (47) 81 I submitted estimates that the pooled net revenues of theRailway Companies would show deficiencies, as compared with the appropriateproportions of the fixed annual sums payable to them, of about  32 million in 1947, or  24^ million in the year ending 30th June, 1948.2. The Cabinet (C.M. (47) 44th Conclusions) agreed in principle that,before the railways come under public ownership, their charges should be increased in order to meet the full cost of their operation, including any increase in costdue to the concession of any part of the claims for shorter working hours orhigher wages; and that I should aim at bringing the necessary increase in chargesinto operation by 1st October, 1947. i3. Without taking into account the cost of the recent award on wagesand hours, the deficiency for 1947 is now estimated at  37-J million. An estimatehas also been made for 1948 and shows that, if a comparison were made withthe fixed annual sums, the deficiency would be  27f million. The increases inthe estimated deficiencies are due mainly to a revision of the estimated receipts from ordinary passengers and general merchandise (other than Governmenttraffic). Recent trends indicate that ordinary passenger traffic is not realisingexpectations. In the case of general merchandise it was previously estimatedthat there would be an increase of 3 per cent, on 1946 receipts in the second half of this year, but it now seems unlikely that this increase will be realiseduntil the middle of next year. &apos;4. I am assuming for present purposes that the recent award on wagesand hours will be implemented. It is estimated that the total additional cost will be  22 million m 1947 and  37^ million in 1948. The total estimateddeficiencies on the above basis are, therefore,  594 million in 1947 and  65 million in 1948.5. The future position will be affected by various factors which vary indegree of certainty.  Factors on the credit side are: (a) Traffics would be better than estimated if trade recovers more quicklythan is now expected.(&amp;) There is some prospect of increased receipts (amounting to some  3 millionJ to  4 million) from Service travel at concession fares if certain sugges-tions which the Chancellor has under consideration are adopted.(c) The estimated expenditures for 1947 and 1948 include provisions of 5^ million in respect of upwards adjustment of maintenance chargesdue to the wages award. These are necessary in order to lift pastprovisions for arrears to reflect the new levels of wages. They wouldnot recur in subsequent years. .(d) The British Transport Commission will save interest charges amountingto nearly  18 million a year on the compensation to Main Line railwaystockholders if transport stock is issued at 2^ per cent, at par.Factors on the debit side are : (a) No allowance has been made for any reduction in traffic due to anincrease in transport charges.
(b) We cannot assume that wages and prices have yet reached their maximum.The Court of Inquiry said that their award was intended as an interim arrangement and recommended a comprehensive review ofgrading of railway workers. The trend of prices affecting railwayexpenditure is still upwards and may be accentuated by an increasein railway charges.(c) The Commission may well be expected to increase the rate of replacement of their outworn assets. Although provision has been made fordeferred maintenance, no full provision has yet been made for making good the large amount of abnormal wear and tear during Control.(d) As the savings in interest rates referred to above are due to the nationalcredit, the Commission must immediately build up a reasonablecushion against drafts on the Exchequer to implement its guarantee.In addition to their interest charges, the Commission will therefore have to provide for redemption of their capital on a long-term basis and for an adequate reserve fund. A reasonable net provision in1948 might be  3-7 million (assuming 80 years) for redemption and 3 million for reserve, or allowing for tax  14-7 million gross, towhich must be added the new profits tax say,  1 - 5 million marking 16-2 million in all.6. In deciding what increase in charges should now be made there are two main considerations to keep in mind. One is that the increase should be such aswill enable the Commission fully to meet their commitments and avoid theirhaving to apply for a further increase at an early stage in their career. Theother is that any increase should be kept as low as possible in order to minimiseits adverse effect on trade recovery.7. The form of the increase is also important. The pre-war relativity ofthe charges for the various groups of traffic had developed over a long periodof years. During the war preferential treatment was given to. seasons and workmen&apos;s fares and to coal and merchandise traffic, for reasons which were no doubt sound at a time when other passenger traffic was at a high level andwas not likely to be affected appreciably by the cost of travel. These conditionsno longer exist and there is a risk that a high increase in ordinary passenger fares will reduce travel and so fail to produce the additional revenue expected.Moreover, in relation to an increase in charges caused to a substantial extent byrises in wage levels, I see no justification for maintaining the &quot; most favoured &quot;treatment of seasons and workmen&apos;s fares paid by those who have received thehigher wages. Generally, there is much to be said for restoring the pre-warrelativity pending consideration by the Commission and the Transport Tribunalin relation to the Commission^ future Oharges schemes. . On these grounds tprefer a flat increase on pre-war charges to a differential increase which is designed to minimise the impact on trade.8. I show in the appendix hereto four possible increases with their estimatedyields and their effect on this year&apos;s deficiency if brought into operation on1st October. Increase A is a differential increase which would yield in 1948 15 million less than the target of  65 million. Increase B is a flat increase witha special measure of simplicity but would fall short of the target by  12 million.Increase C comes within  3 million of the target, but imposes a very high increaseoh ordinary passengers which might result in a reduction of traffic. Increase Dhas the advantages of being a flat increase and of producing about the sum required. The earliest date on which any increase could be brought into opera-tion is 1st October next.9. In considering the increase to be made in the charges of the RailwayCompanies, mention should be made of the position which has arisen in regardto the London Passenger Transport Board. Their Account, previously estimated to balance in 1947, is now estimated to show a deficiency of  2 million in 1947 ascompared with the fixed annual sum payable to the Board. On the same basis,the deficiency in 1948 is estimated to  If million. This is due to the cost of new agreements as to wages and conditions of service of the Board&apos;s road transport and workshop staffs operating from 25th June, 1947, and to the effect of thehigher wages and price levels on the charge for maintenance. No allowance hasbeen made for the settlement of outstanding wages claims from railway staffswhich, on the basis of applying to the Board&apos;s railway staffs the recommenda-tions of the Court of Inquiry into the main line railway claims, would involve33983 b 2
a direct expenditure of approximately  800,000 per annum with a substantial increase in the amounts required in 1947 and 1948 to lift past provisions forarrears of maintenance to reflect the new levels of wages. Moreover, on past experience such a settlement would provoke new claims from the Board&apos;s road transport staff, particularly as the rail motormen already enjoy higher ratesthan the bus drivers whose work is undeniably more onerous.10. Weighing up all these considerations, it seems to me that we cannotsafely estimate the gap between the net revenues from the railways and london transport during the next few years and all charges, to be met from such netrevenues at less than the figure of  65 million given in paragraph 4.This points to increase D if the scheme of nationalised transport is not toshow a deficiency in its inaugural year. On the other hand, I realise theimportance at this time of keeping transport costs as low as circumstances permit.Increase B, an all-round 50 per cent., might over a term of years adjust transport charges to the probable future needs if we may assume a halt to rising costs andsome improvement in traffic, but it would yield about  12 million short of the target next year, on the best estimate that can be framed. As shown in para-grajeh 5 (c), there should be a saving of  5^ million a year after- 1948 in respectof the lift of past provision for arrears of maintenance, and an increased receiptof  3 million to  4 million a year would accrue if the transport undertaking were no longer required to subsidise service travel in the form of concession fares.Between them, these two adjustments should, after 1948, bridge about three-quarters of the gap of  12 million. The question then is whether it is reasonable to look to trade recovery over the next two years to cover the balance. We should then be running great risk of deficiency in 1948, which might mean that provi-sions in that year for redemption and general reserve would have to be suspendedor reduced, but on the whole I am prepared to recommend acceptance of this risk.A.

ANNEX II[L.P. (47) 12523rd July, 1947] - -&apos;.cabinet lord Presidents CommitteeRAILWAY FARES AND  CHARGESNote by the Paymaster-GeneralTHE Committee at its last meeting (L.P. (47) 22nd Meeting, Minute 1 (1)invited the Lord President to arrange for officials of the Departments concerned and of the Economic Section of the Cabinet Office to prepare a memorandumshowing what increases in railway charges would bring the railway revenue andexpenditure most nearly into balance with the least possible detriment to thenational economy.At the request of the Lord President I undertook to collate the opinions of the Departments concerned. I am grateful for the expedition with, which theyhave prepared their views. The paper bears signs of haste in preparation, butin the circumstances that has been unavoidable. Through some of the wording of the remaining paragraphs of this note is my own, the statements of fact andthe conclusions as to policy are agreed by the officials who have been consulted.2. Pricing policy on the general pricing policy of socialised industries, Ministers agreed inMay 1946 &quot; that the controlling board of each socialised industry should normally be under obligation to fix its price at a level which taking an average of goodyears with bad would cover its costs and leave a reasonable margin for contin-gencies&quot; (S.I. (M) (46) 8th Meeting, Minute 2 (1)).3. Can a Temporary Loss be Justified ?If total railway charges and total railway costs are to be balanced on anaverage of years, one must ask whether there is anything about 1947 and 1948which would justify the railways in running at a loss that might be made up byprofits in later years. This is not a period of trade depression; and although itis to be hoped that there will be rising productivity of industry generally and,therefore, a rising volume of traffic over the next few years, a rising volume oftraffic can be carried only if the railways incur much greater costs on maintenance and renewals. It is, to say the least, improbable that, after payment of com-pensation, the Transport Commission would be able to make sufficient profits fromits road operations to outweigh the losses on railway operation if charges remain unchanged. Nor^does it seem to me to be safe to rely upon a rapidly and greatlyincreased productivity of labour in railway operation over the next few years.Other considerations bearing on the prospective movements of receipts and out-goings are specified in paragraph 5 of L.P. (47) 120; of these the most important is the likelihood that labour costs will be further increased. On the other hand,the Minister of Transports estimates include substantial allowance for redemp-tion and reserve funds. On balance, these various considerations do not justifyrunning the railways temporarily at a loss during the next year or so. The advice of the officials is that an all-round increase of 55 per cent, rather than 50 per cent,above pre-war is called for.4. Is a Price-Stabilisation Subsidy Justifiable ?..: It is a mistake to suppose that a rise in railway charges would be inflationary,while a continuance of Exchequer subsidy to the railways would not. On thecontrary, subsidies involving Exchequer deficits are directly inflationary. There-fore the general inflationary situation demands elimination of subsidies wher-ever this can be done without causing major indirect effects in stimulating wage
increases. It is submitted that a general increase in railway charges, for bothgoods and passenger traffic, would, unlike an increase in food prices, not havesubstantial effect in increasing the rate at which the cost of subsistence is nowrising. To the extent that its results are clearly visible to people, it will perhapsdo some good in bringing home to them that in a full employment situation higher wages unaccompanied by increased productivity mean higher prices and leavepeople in general no better off.5. Should the Increase Raise All Charges to an Equal Proportional Level above pre-war-war ?In all recent discussions the railway companies have strongly pressed forflat increases over pre-war charges. At first sight this is surprising, since in thepast railways have charged discriminating rates for different classes of goodsaccording to &quot; what the traffic would bear.&quot; For about ten years or so before thewar, however, under the influence of road competition, the companies were greatlyreducing the extent of their discrimination against the more valuable classes oftraffic. An inter-departmental Working Party has been considering for sometime what long-term charges policy might be suggested to the British transport commission. This Working Party has been critical of the principle of chargingwhat the traffic will bear as inappropriate in a socialised industry, and suggestsas an alternative that the practicability of charging on the basis of cost of service should be investigated. Although it cannot be assumed that the transport commission and the Transport Tribunal will take the same view, there is somecase for refraining in the meantime from increasing the degree of monopolisticdiscrimination which existed before the war. In the absence of evidence of therelative costs of different classes of traffic (which would take some time to ascer-tain even in a broad way.) it is impossible to say how far present chargesreflect present relative costs. It is therefore suggested that the general increasein railway costs, which has affected the cost of carrying every class of traffic, can at present best be covered by equal proportionate increases in all pre-war charges.If an announcement that this is to be done is made we should state that it is a provisional measure and that one of the first tasks of the new Transport Corn-mission will be to consider the principles of charging and their application indetailed charges schedules.6. Should the Price of Coal be Increased to Cover the Increase in, transport charges and Other Cost Increases ?In the discussion at L.P. (47) 22nd Meeting it was stated that the national coal Board had indicated that to meet current costs there should be an increaseof 5s. a ton in the price of coal and that if the charges for carriage of coal were increased to 55 per cent, over the pre-war rate there would be an additionalincrease of 4s. a ton in the price of coal, making 9s. increase in all. This estimatehas now been revised and I am assured that these figures can reasonably be put at 2s. Qd. and Is. 9d. respectively, making 4s. 3d. per ton in total. The questionthus arises whether in pursuance of the principle accepted by Ministers (referredto in paragraph 2 above) the price of coal should, after the rise in railway charges,be raised by 4s. or so a ton.The same arguments apply to coal as to railways on the first three questions raised above. There is nothing to differentiate coal from railways both alikeenter in some degree (and varying degree) into the costs of alf industries* and into the cost of living. As far as coal is concerned there is the further argument that strict economy is necessary every possible incentive should be given toreduce consumption. In theory, this would point to increasing the price of coalmore rather than less than costs have increased. On the other hand, the coal board may take the view that mechanisation will eventually reduce substantially the cost of mining, in which case some temporary loss could be defended. More-over, we cannot ignore the undoubted hardship that a large increase in pricemight inflict this winter upon the poorest classes of domestic consumer. on balance, officials suggest that the right thing to do would be to increase the priceby neither more nor less than the rise in costs. My colleagues may be influenced,however, as, I am, by consideration for the poorer consumer and by the feeling that it is dangerous to do anything further to switch domestic demand away* On the basis of evidence given before the Railway Charges Consultative Committee last autumn it is estimated that the proposed increase in rail charges would (after allowing forconsequential increases in coal, ore and other costs) result in a rise of some 8s. a ton in thecost of semi-finished steel, and a much higher increase for the highly finished products.
from raw coal towards electricity for Heating. If we conclude that in the circum-stances of the coming winter it is impolitic to raise coal prices so as to cover thewhole of the increased costs, they may feel that a partial rise could be defendedby reference to increased rail charges and other costs.7. Effect on Export CostsRaising both railway charges and the price of coal will, of course, raiseindustrial costs generally and among these the cost of making exports. This atfirst sight is unfortunate. The Board of Trade has made some enquiry intorelative changes in costs here and abroad and the tentative result can (with somehesitation) be described as showing that in general costs have risen by much thesame proportion in the United Kingdom, the United States and our other chiefcompetitor countries. The necessity for a relative increase in the volume ofUnited Kingdom exports of course makes it urgently desirable that there shouldbe a smaller relative rise in United Kingdom than in competitors&apos; costs. However,labour and other costs abroad, foreign exchange rates and the whole internationaltrading position are all still so fluid that it would hardly be right to freeze one particular section of United Kingdom costs now in the interest of maintaining our competitive position. What is needed by the export industries is perhaps not so much low cost as certainty of the future level of cost.There are, moreover, strong reasons on both short-term and long-termgrounds against subsidising transport and fuel costs in export production. Fromthe short-term point of view, subsidies must either be financed by additionaltaxation, adding to costs elsewhere and aggravating the general problem ofproduction incentives, or by adding to the inflationary gap which is making the redistribution of labour in favour of export and undermanned industries sodifficult. From the long-term point of view, manipulation in favour of exportcosts would conflict with the prospective I.T.O. arrangements. Moreover, wecan only hope to achieve the necessary development of exports and raising of thestandard of living if we get the most efficient distribution of resources : it isimpossible to secure this unless we get our social accounting right. This above alljustified the immediate elimination of concealed subsidies.8. The Impracticability of Substantial DiscriminationThere are two other important arguments against any substantial departure,in the interest of particular industries, from the principle of a flat-rate increase.First, any exemption in favour of, say, coal and raw materials would necessitatemuch steeper increases in the charges on the higher classification of goods, into which most export goods fall. -Secondly, any attempt to pick out particular commodities, whether export or other classes, from the general railway classifica-tion would greatly lengthen the period of preparation required for bringing thenew charges into effect. For the &quot;proposed flat increases the railways requiresix weeks&apos; notice for anything elaborate they would require many months, thuslengthening the period at which a loss was being incurred.H. M.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,23rd July, 1947.ANNEX IIIProposed Statement on Railway charges the House will recall that I stated on 21st July in answer to Questionsby my Hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, the amounts by which the. pooled netrevenues of the controlled railways are estimated to fall short of the fixed annualsums payable to the Railways under the Control Agreement. I also stated theestimated cost of implementing the recommendations of the Court of inquiry into wages and hours of railwayman, which have since been accepted.2. These estimates indicate shortfalls of about  59 million in 1947 and 65 million in 1948 respectively. In the light of these figures the Governmenthave decided that the charges made by the Railway Companies must be increased
to such an extent as will produce additional revenue of about  65 million in1948, while making some contribution to reduce the liability falling on theExchequer this year.3. During the war and the immediate post-war period when passengertravel was at a high level, it was decided that ordinary passenger fares should bear a higher rate of increase, namely 33  per cent., than other railway charges,increased by 25 per cent. We have come to the conclusion that this differentiation should now cease and accordingly all railway charges will be raised to 55 per cent,above pre-war with effect from 1st October next.4. The question whether the relationship between the various types of charge should be varied will be one for the Transport Tribunal who will settle the chargesschemes of the British Transport Commission after considering the views ofthe Commission and of bodies representative of all classes of users.5. At the railway-owned docks, where the increase on certain charges uponcoastwise liners and their cargoes is 15 per cent, over pre-war, this Iqw rate of increase will be raised to 25 per cent, but extended to all coastwise vessels andtheir cargoes. Other dock charges will be raised from 40 per cent, to 75 per cent,above pre-war.
