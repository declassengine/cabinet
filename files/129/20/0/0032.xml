\   220IS DOCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)setting C R E TC.P.(i4 7)  23216TH AUGUST.  19k7CABINETPROPOSED EXTENSION OP HOURS IN THE COALMINING industry memorandum by the Minister1, of Fuel and Power&apos;The Prime Minister has informed me that he wishesthat any proposals put forward as an alternative to  the 8-hourday should be considered by Ministers before any agreement isreached between the National Coal Board and the National Unionof Mineworkers and before any proposals are referred to theDistrict Committees of the National Union of Mineworkers inorder that Ministers may be satisfied  that such proposals arelikely to give the additional output required.     The discussions between the National Coal Board and the, Ne tional Union of mineworkers have- now reached a point where the National coal board recognise that they must have guidance from theGove rnment.2. Although there were some members of the NationalUnion of Mineworkers Executive who were at first inclined to favour the 8-hour day I understand that contacts with the districts showed&apos;that they would not be able to secure acceptance by the miners.     The National Coal Board on their part, while they anticipate  that an 8-hour day would give anincrease in production of the order of 5 per cent, or 10 million tons a year recognise that  there would be some technical difficulties and objections in certain of the coal divisions and the East Midlands Divisional Bo crd, was-definitely againsti t.3. Both the National Coal Board and the National Unionof Mineworkers recognise that the best way of getting increased output is by effective and full implementation of the 5-day week Agreement, i.e. by increasing stints, stopping restrictive practices and reducing absenteeism.     The National Union of mineworkers are prepared to support measures to decreaseabsenteeism, e.g. dismissal of persistent absentees, but theyfrankly admit that- they have been unable and are still unableto secure the   increases of stints which have to be negotiatedat each pit;    and it has to be recognised that this will be aslow process.4* Proposals and counter proposals for getting increased output by Saturday working have been discussed.      The national coal Board have attached importance to a full shift being workedon Saturdays and time and a half being paid only if the men have already worked /the full five shifts and to a condition that every man must work every other Saturday, i.e. double shiftpits would have to wind every Saturday.     The National UnionCOPY NO.
of Mineworlcers have insisted that Saturday shifts must be-g- hours only (so that the men can get away for Saturdayafternoon sport) and.be paid for at overtime rates.     while they are prepared to co-operate in urging full attendanceduring the week and on.Saturdays and to agree to supportpenalties for absenteeism they are not prepared to agreethat overtime rates for &quot;Saturday working should be conditional on men having worked the full five shifts from Monday toFriday:5* This was the point reached at the last meeting ofthe National Union of Mineworkers and the National Coal Board.They are to meet again at 3 p.m. on Wednesday,  20th August.I have been in touch with both sides and will explain orallythe result of my talks with the that we   must-give the National Goal Board guidance before their next meeting with the National Union of Mineworkers.S.S.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1.,16th August, 19U7. -
