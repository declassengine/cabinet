THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF   HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. July 1947SECRET Copy No. 3fCP. (47) 21928th July, 1947CABINETINTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, GENEVA, 19th june to 11th JULY, 1947Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service the International Labour Conference held its 30th Session at Geneva from19th June to 11th July inclusive. The Governing Body which, with its Com-mittees, had been in continuous Session since 4th June to 17th June, had also tohold two long meetings during the Session of the Conference in order-to finishits business.2. Mr. C. J. Hambro (Norway, Government) made a most efficient andadmirable President of the Conference. The three Vice-Presidents wereMr. Desmaras (Argentine, Government), Sir John Forbes Watson (United King-dom, Employer), and Mr. Robert Watt (United States, Worker).3. I attended the Conference from 23rd to 27th June inclusive, and theParliamentary Secretary was present from 29th June to 3rd July inclusive. Weboth addressed the Conference in Plenary Session and, in the course of ourremarks, referred not merely to the work of the I.L.O. but to the position in thiscountry and to the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in various fields. I myself took the opportunity of giving some account of our general economic progress and prospects which was extremely well received, and in -respect of whichI received many expressions of appreciation and gratitude. The following state-ment by the Minister of Labour for Mexico in his closing speech to the conference is typical of many that were made publicly or in private conversation Howadmirable is the example given us by the United Kingdom which, now that thewar is won, offers to all humanity a spectacle of suffering and austerity in itseffort to restore equilibrium to its economy. That is how peoples win the esteemof the whole world.&quot;Certain remarks which the Parliamentary Secretary had intended to makeregarding our Colonial policy were unfortunately omitted owing to an errorregarding the time-limit for speeches in the &quot;Conference; but one of the Govern-ment Delegates subsequently had the opportunity of making this statement inPlenary Session when the Conventions relating to Non-Metropolitan territories were under consideration. My own address, that of the Parliamentary secretary and the statement on Colonial policy just referred to are attached as Appendix I.4. The Conference, whose agenda was much too heavy for a Session of threeweeks and thus imposed a great strain on delegates and advisers, was neverthe-less extremely successful. It was attended by more representatives than any previous session, it was marked by great enthusiasm on the part of all presentand the results, both in importance and extent, compare not unfavourably withthose of the Montreal Session of last year which previously was probably themost important and successful Conference which the I.L.O. had ever held.5.   From our own point of view, too, the Conference was a success.  In theI.L.O. we still retain the leadership on major questions of policy; our stock is at its highest, and because our policy is based on the principle of steady progresscombined with practical realism, other countries generally look to us to provide34008 - .
a solution when acute differences of opinion develop in the Conference whichthreaten to imperil the work of the Conference in some respect or other. Indeed,on the item of Freedom of Association and Industrial Relations of which morewill- be heard next year and in 1949 there is no doubt that the British Delega-tion (Government, Workers and Employers) was largely responsible for findingsolutions which in the end commanded the unanimous approval of the wholeConference. From our point of view the results of our policy and of the confidencewhich other countries repose in us are to be seen in the fact that on no majorquestion did the decisions of the Conference differ substantially from what theBritish Government Delegation advocated,  s6. A main preoccupation of all present was the question of liberty. Thiswas the keynote of all the proceedings, the theme which ran through speech afterspeech. All delegates, but specially delegates from European countries, wereabsorbed by this question. To the latter countries the United States, for all itstradition of liberty, is somewhat remote; in the Latin American countries thecause of liberty, especially the freedom of trade unions, is more than suspect;and it is to this country which is so near to their own problems, about whosedevotion to the cause of freedom there is no shadow of doubt and which, they feel, is in a fair way to solving the almost intractable problem of personal libertyin a controlled economy, that they look in their apprehensions and their hopes.That is another and possibly the principal reason for our continuing authority in I.L.O. circles.7. Before referring briefly to the various items on the agenda of the Con-f erence there are two other matters which I should mention.8. A feature of the Conference&quot;ence was the part played by the ArgentineDelegation. For some years the Workers&apos; Group in the Conference have beenhighly critical of conditions in the Argentine and especially of Government inter-ference with the Trade Unions. At Paris in 1945 the credentials of the ArgentineWorkers were unanimously rejected by the Conference on the ground that condi-tions of freedom did not exist which permitted the carrying out of the provisionsof the I.L.O. Constitution relating to consultation with representative tradeunions when appointing workers&apos; representatives. Had the credentials of theArgentine Workers been seriously challenged on the same ground at subsequentConferences, including that just concluded, it would have been extremely difficultto avoid the same result. The Workers&apos; group, however, have exercised greatrestraint and have not officially supported a challenge.9. On the other hand the Argentine Delegation, under the leadership ofa strong but somewhat unpleasant personality in Mr. Desmaras, adopted an extremely aggressive attitude throughout the Conference. The argentine government had, prior to the opening of the Conference, expressed the desire tohave the Governmental Vice-Presidency of the Conference, and although theywere advised to wait a year, they persisted in pressing this demand and declared their intention of carrying the matter to a vote in order to see &apos;&apos; who were their friends.&quot; This piece of &quot;blackmail&quot; was extremely effective, for when mr. Desmaras was proposed for the Vice-Presidency by a succession of latin american delegates, certain delegates from other countries who had expressed their intention and desire to propose another candidate did not do so. Indeedmore than one European delegate admitted privately that they must not offendthe Argentine because their Governments were on the point of making agreements with that country.10. There is no doubt that the Argentine was feeling the strength of its position in relation to those countries which need food and raw materials andis determined to make the most of that advantage. Two other matters bearing on this may be mentioned. The Argentine Workers&apos; Delegate made a strongattack in Plenary Session on the English-speaking countries and, althoughpublicly castigated by Sir Joseph Hallsworth on behalf of the Workers&apos; Group,refused to withdraw. Secondly, the Argentine Delegation submitted severalresolutions, in the course of one of which the Conference was asked to eulogisePresident Peron and all his works. These resolutions never saw the light of day for the Officers of the Conference, despite the violent denunciations ofMr. Desmaras, threw them out as being out of time.11. I have referred at some length to the attitude of the Argentine Delega-tion because it coincided with the crystallisation of a tendency which has beenevident for some time, namely,-the emergence of the Latin American countries
as a bloc which almost invariably vote together. The Argentine clearly was making a bid for the leadership, of that bloc which was not unsuccessful andwas accompanied by a diminution of the influence which the United States has previously been able to exercise on the Latin American countries. Takenaltogether this is a disturbing feature of recent groupings in the I.L.O., for theLatin American countries between them hold a very substantial proportion ofthe votes in the Organisation.12. The second matter which I should like to mention is the attitude ofthe Australian Delegation. This delegation was extremely strong and was ablyled by Mr. Ward, Minister of Transport and External Territories. On almost all questions the delegation adopted a rather extreme leftish attitude and&apos; submitted to the various draft Conventions, Recommendations and Resolutions,especially the draft Conventions relating to Non-Metropolitan Territories, a seriesof amendments which, if they had been accepted, might have rendered the instru-ments in question impracticable, would have imperilled their passage or, if theywere passed, their ratification or acceptance or implementation as the case mightbe. In almost every case the Australian proposals were rejected and the british delegates were placed in the unfortunate position of having frequently to opposeproposals by one of the Dominions. Mr. Ward, a strong personality with verypositive and advanced views, who personally was very charming and approachable(although the only social occasions at which he assisted were my luncheon to theCommonwealth Delegates and the reception given by the President of theConference), seemed to bear no ill-will on account of his many defeats and admittedin conversation that his various proposals would have given rise to great difflcul-ties in their application. He had pressed them, so he said, because he felt thatthe interpretation of the provisions of Conventions could properly, be left to individual Governments in the light of their domestic circumstances; and also because in Australia they believed in setting the standards embodied in legislation at the highest possible, being prepared to amend the law subsequently if the standards proved impracticably high. These views show a surprising absence of appreciation of the sanctity to be attached to I.L.O. Conventions and of thedifficulty of revising those Conventions when once they are passed. It is to benoted that Mr. Ward in his formal address to the Conference was somewhatlukewarm in his references to the achievements of the I.L.O. and it may be that,unlike recent Australian Delegates to the I.L.O. who have been outspoken intheir praise, he shares the views attributed to Dr. Evatt that the I.L.O. is ncaringthe end of its usefulness and that with all the other Specialised Agencies itshould be subordinated to or become absorbed into the Economic and social council.13. I append some brief notes on the items dealt with by the Conference..Finance14. The Conference approved a net expenditure Budget for 1948 at SwissFrs. 18,942,983 compared with Swiss Frs. 15,952,900 for 1947, an increase ofrather more than 15 per cent. The increase is more than accounted for by an expansion in the numbers and by improvements in the emoluments of the Staff.Even at this increased figure (equivalent to $4,425,930) the expenditure is probably the lowest of all the Specialised Agencies. On the income side the number of units of contribution from the States Members of the Organisation will beincreased from 690 for 1947 to- 784 in 1948, due to an increase in the numberof units payable by the United States from 108 to 150 and to increases by variousEuropean countries whose pre-war contributions had been-considerably scaleddown.   The United Kingdom contribution remains at 108 units.Freedom of Association and Industrial Relations15. This was probably the most important matter considered by the Con-ference. It had been raised first in the form of a memorandum and draft resolution submitted by the W.F.T.U. to the Economic and Social Council; thiswas followed by a memorandum and resolution submitted to the same Council bythe American Federation of Labour. At the Council meeting last March theUnited Kingdom Delegation took the lead in having this subject referred to theI.L.O., within whose competence it primarily lay, while recognising also thatsome aspects of the subiect called for consideration by the Commission on human rights, to which the documents were also referred. The I.L.O- was requestedto report back to the Council in time for its July Session.   It was, therefore,34008 b 2
of importance that the IX. Conference should show that it intended to handleall the questions within its recognised competence firmly and expeditiously, both because of their intrinsic importance, and in order to avoid any possibility ofthe Economic and Social Council itself taking up these questions or establishingseparate machinery to do so. In the result quite unexpected progress was made and the Conference unamimously took the following action :  (1) It passed a Resolution covering Freedom of Association, and the Rightto Organise and to Bargain Collectively. (This is shown inAppendix II.) ;(2) It decided to proceed in 1948 to the passing of a Convention covering theprinciples dealt with in the Resolution but excluding the detailed application of the principle relating to non-discrimination againsttrade unionists (see paragraph 9 of the Resolution. Those detailsraise extremely controversial issues including that of the closed shop,and it proved impossible to obtain agreement to conclude a convention on this matter before 1949).(3) It decided to put on the Conference agenda for the 1948 session a numberof other important matters with a view to the adoption of one or moreConventions in subsequent sessions.   These matters comprise-^&apos;(i) detailed application of the principle of non-discrimination against trade unionists;(ii) collective agreements;(iii) conciliation and arbitration;(iv) co-operation between public authorities and employers&apos;  and workers&apos; organisations.(4) It passed a resolution asking the Governing Body of the IX.O. to examine and report to the 1948 Conference on a proposal to establish inter-national machinery for safeguarding freedom of association(Appendix II).16. One comment is necessary on (4) above. A proposal to establish such machinery was the only positive suggestion for action put forward in theW.F.T.U. resolution to the Economic and Social Council. A similar proposal was put forward American Federation of Labour.   The Workers&apos; group in the IX. Conference was anxious for the Conference to adopt the principle ofthe proposal immediately, but the difficulties are obvious and there was a clearlikelihood of the Conference splitting on this issue. Furthermore it is important that this question of international machinery, should not be considered by their.O. in isolation from the work to be done by the Commission on Human rights in relation to the whole problem of the enforcement of human rights through some form of international machinery. The United Kingdom GovernmentDelegation accordingly put forward the resolution set out in Appendix II whichexpressed sympathy with the proposal, called attention to some of the difficulties and asked the Governing Body to examine and report on it to next year&apos;s Con-ference.   This, as stated, was unanimously adopted by the Conference.Organisation of Employment Service17. The Conference had a first discussion on this question and decided theprinciples which would be embodied in a Convention and a Recommendation tobe adopted next year.Organisation of Labour Inspection in Industrial and Commercial Undertakings18. The Conference adopted a Convention concerning Labour Inspection in industry and Commerce. The Conference also adopted two Recommendationsconcerning Labour Inspection.Social Policy in Non-Metropolitan Territories19.   On this subject the Conference adopted the following Conventions: (1) Social Policy in Non-Metropolitan Territories.(2) Right of Association and Settlement of Labour Disputes.(3) Maximum Length of Contracts of Employment of Indigenous &quot;Workers.(4) Labour Inspectorates.(51 Uhe Application of International Labour Standards to Non-metropolitan territories.
20. These call for no special comment at this stage except the first into which, as happens at almost every international gathering, the question of equal pay was introduced. The United Kingdom Goverjnment Delegation were con-cerned to avoid any commitments in regard to the Colonies which were incon-sistent with Government policy at home and amendments to the draft Conventionhad been agreed in discussion between the Treasury, the Colonial Office and theMinistry of Labour which would have substantially safeguarded this position.In the event it was not possible to move the amendments in the form agreed,partly because the discussion was very confused and partly because the form of the relevant clauses was changed by the adoption of prior amendments. However,owing to the efforts of the United Kingdom Delegation the form in which theclause relating to equal pay was finally adopted was as follows, which shouldnot be embarrassing to the Government&quot;It shall be an aim of policy to abolish all discrimination amongworkers on grounds of race, colour, sex, belief, tribal association or tradeunion application in respect of- (i) wage rates, which shall be fixed according to the principle of equal pay for work of equal value in the same operation and under-taking to the extent to which recognition of this principle isaccorded in the metropolitan territory.&quot;Readmission of Austria,21. The Conference decided unanimously to re-admit Austria to member-ship of the Organisation. This was done soon after the commencement of the&quot;Session and an Austrian Delegation was present throughout the Session.Credentials &apos;22 The credentials of the Workers&apos; Delegates from a number of countries(including Greece) were challenged, but the challenges were all rejected by the credentials Committee.General23. Amongst other matters the Conference dealt with a number of Beso-resolutions submitted by various parties including a somewhat difficult resolution onwomen&apos;s work, &amp;c, submitted by the United States Government. Owing to theefforts of the United Kingdom Government Delegation these were all shorn oftheir objectionable features and put into a not unacceptable form before being adopted by the Conference.The Governing Body        \24. The Governing Body had an extremely heavy agenda which it succeeded in completing only the day before the Conference ended. The only decisions towhich I need refer here are the following :  .25. Greece. The Governing Body decided to accede to a request from theGreek Government to send a mission to Greece to advise in the recasting of thesocial, labour and trade union legislation and regulations of that country.26. Place and Date of 1948 Conference. The Governing Body, in response to an invitation from the Government of the United States, decided that the31st&apos;Session of the Conference should be held at San Francisco commencing on17th June, 1948.G.

APPENDIX I&apos; &apos;.&apos; &apos; HI       1     &apos; (A)       ill      .Speech of the Minister of Labour and National Service to the InternationalLabour Conference, Thursday, 26th June, 1947Extract from Provisional Record for Thursday, 26th June, 1947Mr. ISAACS (Minister of Labour and National Service of Great Britain) :Once again I gladly avail myself of the privilege of addressing you. It is aspecial pleasure to do so here in Geneva, because it was in this City that I took a direct part in your proceedings some years back then as a delegate amongthe Workers&apos; representatives of Great Britain. The British trade unions have always been warm supporters of the I.L.O., and as one coming from the ranksI welcome the opportunity of expressing the adherence of our Government to your ideals and principles.      * * . :I would like to begin my remarks by congratulating the Director-general on his comprehensive, informative and very valuable Report. It shows clearly that over wide areas of the world, embracing many countries, the economic problems of those countries are basically the same, although they may differ indegree. So far as Europe is concerned, including my own country, the main problems are, as pointed out by the Director-General, shortage of food, shortageof fuel and power, shortage of labour, and particularly of skilled labour, andshortage of foreign currency, particularly &quot;hard&quot; currency.We in the United Kingdom know that we have serious economic problems to face. These arise from the fact that for six years, from 1939 to 1945, wewaged total war against the Nazi menace. The British people, with their kinsmenof the Dominions, fought with all their resources from the first day of the war to the last. During those six years no thought was given to the future; everythingwas sacrificed to enable our country to wage war to the full extent of our resources.As a result, when victory finally came in 1945, we found ourselves, as a nation, exhausted physically as well as exhausted in material resources. Asthe Director-General says in his admirable &quot; General Conclusions&quot; : It is the combination of material damage, economic dislocation, and physical and moralexhaustion, which together make the task of statesmen who have to rebuild theworld so formidable.&quot; But although weakened physically and depletedmaterially, we emerged with greater moral and spiritual strength than the nationhas ever known. It is because of this moral and spiritual strength that we havemade such great progress in the reconversion of our industry and the resettlement of our people in the two years since the end of the war, and we will continueso to do.We &quot;were able to make our great contribution towards winning the warbecause we were so successful in mobilising our energies and resources for war.That very success is the cause of our immediate difficulties, because the needsof peace are so different from those of war. The energy and resources which wonthe war are now being turned back into the ways of peace; and just as it tooktime to achieve that mobilisation for war which brought us victory, so it is takingtime to adjust our economy to peaceful ends.Those were dark days in 1940, 1941 and 1942; but during those years theresources were being assembled which swept the submarines from the seas, whichdrove the enemy war planes from the skies, which laid the German cities inruins, which took the Eighth Army from El Alamein to Tunis and on into italy, and which brought ultimate victory in Burma and on the Rhine.But our success is no more in doubt now than it was then. If I may againquote the Director-General, it is &quot; the extraordinary manifestation of spiritualresiliency which perpetually triumphs over checks and disappointments.&quot; Thesame innate strength and confidence are now being redeployed, and in due time they will assuredly bring us prosperity in peace. It is because of this moral and spiritual strength that Britain will emerge triumphant from its present difficulties. A people that stood alone for a whole year against the full strengthof German military might is not going to surrender to economic difficulties. Thewhole nation is conscious of these difficulties, and I am very glad that theDirector-General has referred in more than one place in his Report to the policyof the British Government of securing the active co-operation of organisations of
employers&apos; and of workers in increasing the production of the country and the-efficiency of its industries.The I.L.O. is a tripartite organisation of Governments, employers and workers. It derives its strength from the nature of its organisation. In Britainwe applied the same principle throughout the war. Then, all labour problemswere discussed between the Minister of Labour and National Service, on behalfof the Government, and representatives of the Trades Union Congress and theBritish Employers&apos; Confederation. That was done through a Joint consultative committee of representatives of employers and workers, sitting under the chair-manship of the Minister of Labour and National Service. Since the end of thewar, that method of consultation and discussion has been continued and extendedthrough a National Joint Advisory Council. This Council consists of seventeenrepresentatives each of the Trades Union Congress and the British Employers&apos;Confederation, sitting under my chairmanship, and it deals with all matters of,common interest to employers and workers. By these means, both sides of industryin Great Britain are giving the Government every assistance in endeavouring to solve the difficult industrial and economic problems with which the country isat present faced.The Director-General has referred to the White Paper issued a few months ago by the Government with the endorsement of the National Council. this white Paper represents a very significant development in the collaboration ofboth sides of industry with the Government, and I am very glad to see here to-day the two leaders of our National Joint Advisory Council, Sir Joseph Hallsworthand Sir John Forbes Watson, who gave such great assistance in the preparationof the White Paper.Our central economic problem in Great Britain is our shortage of coal and power. So far as power is concerned, the shortage arises from the fact that duringthe war our Government deliberately refused to divert labour and materials fromessential war work to build new power stations. This is a striking example ofthe way in which we are suffering now as a result of utilising all our resources for waging war. It will take us two years before there is any substantial improve-ment, but after that the situation will right itself rapidly.So far as coal is concerned, the position is now much better than that depictedin the Director-GeneraFs RepOrt. Since the industry became nationalised on1st January this year, there has been a marked increase in the man-power ofthe industry. The previous downward trend has been reversed, and there hasbeen an average increase in the number of wage-earners on the colliery booksof about 5,000 a month and, may I add, of men volunteering to go into or returnto that industry.Britain, like a number of other countries, is suffering from an acute shortageof man-power. This also arises from the war as, in addition to having to replaceor rebuild nearly 4 million houses damaged or destroyed, and to overtake six years&apos;of arrears of house and factory building, we have to re-equip all those industries which were closed down during the war, to continue to develop our social services,and to make up years of arrears in the production of consumer goods. Here again the signs are encouraging. The latest figures published last week show that our total working population after falling continuously since we reached the peak of our mobilisation in September 1943, is now beginning to rise again. This,I think, is due to a realisation by our men and women of the country&apos;s need.Once again the women of the nation are voluntarily coming to the country&apos;said. In April there was an addition of 10,000 women to our total working population. In no country in the world did the women make a greater contribu-tion to the war effort than in Britain, where nearly 2\ million additional womengave their services to the nation in its need. Now, to help the nation through its present difficulties, we find once again the same public spirit animating ourwomen. This is another manifestation of the determination of the people of britain to place the economy of the country on a firm foundation.Our shortage of labour is also being relieved in some measure, by the employ-ment of European volunteer workers, arid I emphasise &quot;volunteer.&quot; These aredisplaced persons in Europe, who have volunteered to come to Britain. We aregrateful to those who have volunteered, and very glad to have their help inassisting us to increase the labour force in our undermanned industries. At thesame time it is giving us the opportunity to make a substantial contribution tothe problem of restoring the displaced persons to the full rights of citizenshipand of giving them once again a home of their own. Owing to the acute shortageof accommodation in Britain, arising from the loss of and damage to so many millions of our houses, we have been forced to house these European volunteer   .
workers temporarily in camps--as indeed many British people are housed. Theyare, however, being transferred as quickly as possible to hostels and homes. Theyare being placed in employment in those industries and services where thereis a specially acute shortage of man-power, and they are being paid the samewages and work under exactly the same conditions as British workers. For thisabsolute equality of treatment, for their humanitarian and sympathetic reception and for their treatment as normal members of the community, those who havealready come to Britain have expressed their sincere gratitude.With man-power in short supply we realise -and here I include both therepresentatives of the employers and those of the workers that we can only-make up for this shortage by increasing production. Everyone in the countryis becoming increasingly alive to this fact, which was so strongly emphasised inthe White Paper to which I have already referred. One method that we areadopting for stimulating production and increasing productivity is, in agreementwith both sides of industry, to encourage the formation of Joint committees in our industrial establishments. These are committees of management and workers who will sit down together and consider jointly how production in theestablishment can be increased. They will accordingly be the counterpart in the.workshop of the discussions at national level.In his Report the Director-General says that &quot; in the United Kingdom, theproblem of the balance of payments continues to dominate the scene.&quot; He isquite right. It is our most vital economic problem of the near f future-andwe are, of course, not the only country faced with this, problem. Obviously wecannot continue indefinitely to import more goods than we can pay for by exports.In our present situation we must get our exports up and keep our imports down..This means that the people of Britain, whose standard of life depends solargely on imports, will have to continue to live a life of austerity for some time.That is going to impose continued hardship on the British people. But make no mistake about it, the British people are determined to see Great Britainonce more paying her way in the world. They are prepared to put up withcontinued hardship in the knowledge that it will result in the restoration of a sound British economy.As an indication of what has already been done to increase our exports,may I restate the information contained in the Director-General&apos;s Report aboutthe numbers engaged on making goods for export. Just before the war, in 1939,we had a little under 1 million people engaged in the manufacture of goods forexport. During the war our exports fell to negligible proportions, and less thana quarter of a million people were engaged in their manufacture. During thetwo years since the end of the war in 1945 we have not only reached our pre-war position, but to-day there are just under 1^ million and the total is stillincreasing -engaged on manufacturing goods for export, that is, an increaseof 50 per cent, above the pre-war number. In a country where labour is short thisis a considerable achievement and a further indication of our determination andour ability to solve this most difficult of all our economic problems.Furthermore, in spite of our difficulties we are not going to be deflected from our policy of developing our social services. Last year we passed comprehensivemeasures giving social security to every citizen. These measures will become fully operative next year. In addition we have raised the school-leaving ageby one year. This has been done quite deliberately and with the full knowledgeof our man-power situation. We are making a temporary sacrifice and it isa considerable sacrifice at the moment f or the much greater gain that will accrue to us in the future. We are certain that the continued development of our social services will not only add to our industrial strength but will also add materiallyto the welfare and wellbeing of our people.But the United Kingdom cannot solve all her problems alone. Nations werenever more interdependent economically than they are to-day, and not onlymust Great Britain increase her production, but all countries in Europe must do so in fact all countries the world over. Following the recent historic speech of Mr. Marshall, the United States Secretary of State, our Foreign Secretary,.Mr. Bevin, has lost ho time in seeking to obtain the co-operation of all countriesin Europe in finding a way to economic recovery.The importance of the International Labour Organisation in this situationis plain for all to see. It is a world-wide organisation of nations and its strength,is in its tripartite nature. The collaboration of Governments, employers and workers is essential if a successful solution is to be found for the economic illsof the world. In fact, it is the only way. There are of course many questionswhich employers&apos; and workers&apos; representatives must necessarily approach from
different points of view, but it is only through the frank interchange of opinionon the basis of equality that it is possible to frame policies which are bothpracticable and capable of implementation on the basis of common agreement.In individual countries also the same tripartite co-operation is the key tothe development of harmonious relations in industry. The problem here, however,is a more complex one and consists in evolving through experience an orderlysystem of relationship between employer and worker and a satisfactory adjust-ment of function as between organised employers and workers on the one handand the Governments on the other.So far as terms and conditions of employment are concerned, we in the UnitedKingdom believe implicity in the virtues of industrial self-government. our system of industrial relations rests firmly on the system of collective bargainingbetween employers&apos; and trade unions, to whom we consider should be entrustedthe full responsibility for the determination of terms and conditions ofemployment.On the other hand, it is the function of Government in our view : first, to stimulate and assist the establishment of joint voluntary machinery for the determination of terms and conditions and the prevention and settlement of disputes; secondly, to assist in the operation of such machinery by providingmeans for conciliation and voluntary arbitration; thirdly, to provide both sides of industry with all information necessary to enable them to consider wagesand other problems in relation to the economic situation of the country as a whole;and finally, where there is no adequate voluntary machinery for the regulationof wages and conditions, or where any such voluntary machinery is likely to cease to exist or to be adequate and a reasonable standard of remuneration will notbe maintained, the Government should be enabled to establish suitable machineryfor the fixing of minimum standards of remuneration. It is on these principlesthat the practice of industrial relations in the United Kingdom continues to bebased.We are now in the process of nationalising some of our most important industries : coal, civil aviation, transport and electricity supply, but this develop-ment has brought with it no departure from the general principles which I have outlined. The nationalised industries are administered by public Boards andit has been specifically laid down by legislation that those Boards are under an obligation to consult with the trade unions with regard to the establishment of joint voluntary machinery for the negotiation of terms and conditions of employ-ment and the settlement of disputes.It is the Governments intention that exactly the same principles of collective bargaining should apply in nationalised as in privately owned industry. In1939 the number of workers covered by joint voluntary agreements in GreatBritain was 10 million. The development of voluntary machinery was continuousthroughout the war, and by 1945 the number of workpeople covered by jointvoluntary agreements had risen to 12,250,000, thus covering over 80 per cent,of the insured workpeople of the country.With the end of the war we entered a period of large-scale reorganisation and reconversion in industry, involving the absorption of some millions of menand women from the forces and large-scale transference from war-time to peace-time production. It was against this background that the major industries ofthe country T?ere faced with the necessity of adjusting their terms and conditionsof employment to the needs of the post-war period. The Government consideredthat the system which had stood us in such good stead throughout the war could best be trusted also to deal with these problems of the post-war period, andits confidence has not been misplaced.Since the end of the Japanese war the working hours of A.\ million workers have been reduced by an average of three hours per week, and to-day averagewage rates are 66 per cent, above the pre-war figure. Since July 1946, whenthe cycle of post-war settlements was concluded, wage rates have remainedvirtually stable. This position has been reached with the minimum of industrialdisturbance. In the two years following the First World War, the number ofworking days lost owing to trade disputes amounted to 61,500,000. Since theend of the Second World War the corresponding figure is 4,900,000.These results have been most encouraging. They spring largely from thefact that our free system of industrial relations commands the confidence of those affected by its decisions, and that the employers&apos; associations and trade unionsretain in their own hands full authority in regard to the matters which are ofthe greatest &quot;concern to their members. Organisations of employers and work-people have over the years come to regard themselves as directly responsible for.   34008 c
tiheir own affairs so far as wages and conditions of employment are concerned,and harmony between the parties has rested on the firm basis of freedom ofassociations and freely negotiated settlements. The British Government regard it of the utmost importance that this main support for organisation and mutual confidence should be preserved.The large-scale reconversion of industry from a war to a peace basis has been necessary to restore our economy. We have effected this vast operation with a progressive decrease in labour controls, until to-day practically no controls what-ever exist. In fact, very shortly every labour control will have completelydisappeared. This has been the deliberate policy of the British Government,who are the firmest adherents of free democracy. We realise that many of thedifficulties of a planned economy could be overcome by means of controls, particu-larly of controls affecting the freedom of the individual&apos;s choice of employment,but we have deliberately discarded this method and chosen the more difficult way.That way is based upon the principles of freedom enshrined in the Charter ofthe United Nations Organisation and the Constitution of the InternationalLabour Office. It is only in that way that an era of prosperity and happinesscan be established. . &apos;An era of prosperity and happiness. Those few words epitomise the wholeneed of the human race prosperity and happiness. Prosperity for the peopleof all lands and not for the few. Prosperity that others can enjoy as well as ourselves. The raising of the standard of life so that poverty and exploitationshall be no more. Thus will come not envy or malice, jealousy or bitterness, butgenuine happiness in the knowledge that others are prosperous. The wardestroyed prosperity and happiness throughout the world. Those troubled war years brought problems which must now be faced and must be resolved. Behindus lie human tragedy, suffering and darkness. The future holds opportunity,brightness and the promise of achievement. Humanity has the right to brighterand happier days. Therefore let us face the future, face what may come withresolution, with determination to do all in our power to achieve that prosperityand happiness, to build the sure foundations of a true and stable humanrelationship.(B)Speech oe the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour and national Service to the International Labour Conference, Thursday,3rd July, 1947Extract from. Provisional Record for Thursday, 3rd July, 1947. Mr. NESS EDWARDS [Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour and national Service of Great Britain) : I am very grateful for this opportunity ofaddressing this Session of the International Labour Conference, the first to beheld in this magnificent building since 1939. I recall with very great pleasurethe part I was able to take in the Conference in Paris in 1945, when we relit thelamps of Europe.Owing to the pressure of Parliamentary duties, it has not, to my regret,been possible for me to be here throughout the whole of the present Session ofthe Conference, but both the Minister and myself have each been able to spenda week or two here. We have taken the unusual course, with your permission,of both visiting Ministers from the United Kingdom addressing the Conference,and you will, I feel sure, take that as further evidence, if indeed further evidence is required, of the support which successive British Governments have constantlygiven to the International Labour Organisation, and the devotion of the british people to the ideals and purposes which this Organisation enshrines.Like other speakers, I should like to congratulate the Director-General onan excellent Report, packed with information, clear in exposition, and rich inthose phrases of which the Director-General is a master, and which underline ourpurposes and illumine the road along which this Organisation is travelling.Despite all the post-war difficulties, this Organisation has proved to be an institution that can be proud of its achievements. If I refer specially to onefeature of the Report the record of increasing co-operation with the united nations and other international organisations it is because I believe that wecannot afford to miss the smallest chance of working together if we are to have
any real hope of accomplishing the common tasks of banishing war and bringinghappiness, prosperity and freedom to all our peoples. The British government therefore welcomes wholeheartedly this new development, which has followed the conclusion of the Agreement with the United Nations.I do not intend to traverse the Director-General&apos;s Report in detail, but Iwould like to refer rather to some of the matters which the Conference has.before it at this present Session.For years British Governments have declared for a policy of full employ-ment. This policy, as we have discovered, will require an efficient employment service organisation. Our Government therefore welcomes the attention whichthe International Labour Conference is giving, through the proposals for aConvention and a Recommendation, to this question.During the war we were compelled to deploy our manpower in the most effective way, in order to ensure that freedom might live in the world. To meetthe tasks of reconstruction and the need for an acceptable standard of living, wemust still use the national manpower resources to the greatest advantage. Inour country we have already made good progress towards this aim. Before theend of the war we established Appointments Offices specially adapted to helpworkers qualified for higher appointments and employers needing to fill vacanciesfor which workers with such qualifications are required. These AppointmentsOffices have had a special -r&amp;le in the reconstruction period in helping those whosecareers had been interrupted by the war. By the employment of specially trainedstaff, and with help from industry, for which we are most grateful, we have provided a service which has proved of great value in this special field. We shall continue and develop it as a permanent feature of our organisation. During and since the war we have considerably developed the use of technically trained officersin employment service work and the specialised training of employment service staff. The work of our Juvenile Employment Service has been thoroughlyreviewed, with the object among others of securing the closest practical integra-tion with the work of education authorities. The technique of vocational guidance is receiving the closest attention, not merely in connection with juveniles,but, in appropriate ways, in the Employment Exchanges and Appointments Officesas well. We are convinced that with full employment the machinery of theemployment service must endeavour to cover all employment needs, both manualand professional; equally, it must be an avenue for all citizens to the whole range of employment in a modern society, and we welcome therefore the attention whichthe International Labour Organisation proposes to give to the matter.While I am on the question of employment, there are few questions whichcommand so much interest to-day as the employment of disabled persons. TheI.L.O. has taken a special interest in this question, and has done much goodwork in connection with it, and it may not be out of place if I make somemention of British experience of this problem, of our arrangements, and of the humanitarian way in which the disabled are dealt with. Not only do our schemescover all men and women disabled by war service, but they cover everyone, how-ever they receive their disablement whether it is as a result of accident or injuryin the factory, in the home, in the street or on the sea, or whether it is congenital.It is only in comparatively recent years that this problem of disablement hascome to be recognised not only as a medical problem but as a problem of employ-ment and a matter of economic concern. Two factors have helped to bring about this recognition. One is the growth of social insurance and, in particular, of insurance against industrial injuries. This has brought home to industry theimportance of restoring the victims of industrial accidents to fitness and healthat the earliest possible moment, because the injured workman&apos;s continuedincapacity is seen to be a charge upon industry and a drain upon the economy..But it was the recent world war that first directed attention effectively to the factthat the ability to employ disabled people in industry might be a factor of real importance in maintaining production. As the problem of finding manpowersimultaneously for the Services and for industry became acute, we were driven to look afresh at the large body of men and women who might have some sub-stantial physical handicap, but who nevertheless represented a potential labour-force. It was in this way that the problem of disablement came to be clearly seen as a problem of employability and to be recognised as a matter of State concern.Our experience has shown conclusively that the great majority of the disabledare capable with proper treatment and training, and with proper selection oftheir jobs -of taking their part in ordinary employment alongside the able-bodied; and that, of those who are not able to take their part in competitive34008 n o
industry, most are capable of rendering some useful service under shelteredconditions and so yielding a net gain to the national economy. Our experience has also demonstrated the relationship between the employment aspects of theproblem and other aspects which fall within the medical and social fields. It isnow clear that advance in industrial rehabilitation and resettlement must be accompanied by similar advances in the hospital services and in the sphere of social legislation. In particular, medical treatment and hospital rehabilitationmust be closely linked with industrial resettlement that is to say, with industrial rehabilitation, vocational training and selective placing in employment. In. my country this link has been achieved centrally by a standing committee whichco-ordinates the activities of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour,and locally, at a lower level, by the creation of a special service within the employ-ment exchanges working in collaboration with the local hospital services.We have embodied the results of our experience in legislation the broad aim off which is to assist men and women who are handicapped by any form of dis-ablement to get employment or work which is suitable for them and which makes the best use of their capacity.We do this in three ways. First of all, we provide courses of vocational training and industrial rehabilitation designed especially for those who need to learn a new profession, trade or occupation, or who require a special course to fit them for return to work after hospital treatment.Secondly, we reserve a fair share of normal employment for the disabled bythe establishment of a quota of employment in every factory unit employing morethan 20 persons. For this purpose we have established a disabled persons register,and every disabled person in the country can come on that register and be avail-able to make up the statutory quota.Thirdly, for those who are only fit for sheltered employment and cannotstand up on their own legs in competition in industry, we have devised anothermethod. What we have done in this connection is to create a Disabled PersonsEmployment Corporation, financed wholly by public funds. Its task will be to erect factories in which the sheltered employment shall be available to the disabled persons.Although we have this legislation, I would emphasise that success depends upon the goodwill of employers, trade unions and others. There is an abundantfund of goodwill for this work, and it only needs to be tapped to ensure success.I hope that this outline of our experience and of the measures which we havefounded upon it will serve to show the importance which we have come to attach to this problem as part of our economic and industrial policy.It has given the British Government great pleasure to receive from time totime representatives of other countries and to enable them to study in detail allthat we are doing. We hope they have got some valuable help from our experience,and we wish them well in developing their own arrangements in this sphere. Thewelcome we have given to those who have already been to our country we willequally extend to any other Government, workers or employers who would liketo come and see what we are doing in this connection.There is another item on the agenda of this Session of the Conference,namely, the organisation of labour inspection, in which the United Kingdom,as will be apprecia,ted, has a special interest. I might almost say that we havea paternal interest in this problem, since my country was one of the first to inaugurate the appointment of special inspectors to promote the stricter and more effective application of measures for the protection of workers in connection withtheir work. Our first factory inspectors, four in number, were appointed in1833; and from that small beginning there has developed in our country anelaborately organised Factory Inspection Department. Not many years later inthe early 1800&apos;s we organised a Mines Inspection Service which has developedon similar lines; and in more recent times we have had a service of wagesinspectors for the enforcement of certain minimum wage rates prescribed by statutory Orders for particular classes of occupations. On the other hand andthis is important we leave wages in general to be. settled through the joint negotiating machinery on a voluntary basis, and our policy as regards the scopeof labour inspection is similar to that provided in paragraph 4 of the resolution on this subject adopted by the Third Conference of American States Members ofthe I.L.O. in 1948, namely, that labour inspectors should not perform conciliation and arbitration functions. /As regards the future, the Government of Great Britain recently appointed a special Committee to make enquiries and submit recommendations as to strengthening the present law on the subject of the health, welfare and safety of
workers in places of employment outside the Factories Act and the Mines andQuarries Acts, and it is hoped that this enquiry will cover some parts of trans:port undertakings and agriculture, as well as commercial establishments and avery miscellaneous field of employments of a non-industrial character in profes-sional establishments, institutions, places of entertainment and so on.You at the I.L.O. have further studied this question, notwithstanding diffi-culties arising out of the war; and in the &quot;light of all the information now collected,this Conference will, I hope, be able to make a really valuable step forward byformulating a Convention which, while it may not cover the whole of the vastfield of employment, will embody a group of general principles applicable to atleast a very large part of that field.In Great Britain, the greatest strides forward in the development of welfarearrangements for the workers were made, as is known, during and under theinfluence of the two recent wars. Let us hope it will be.no less readily recognisedthat the well-being of the workers is an essential weapon in the fight for a pros-prosperous peace; and I feel confident that this great International Organisation can and will contribute very largely to the attainment of that hope and to the con-sequential raising of standards of life and work throughout the world.I am sorry I am taking too much time, and I must conclude. I will do so by making a brief reference to the question of freedom of association. This is not an academic question, it is a burning question of immediate urgency and importance to us all. It is perhaps one of the most important questions that theworld has to face. Freedom of association is, of course, a part of that largerfreedom which is so much in the minds and thoughts of peoples everywhereto-day, and which for most of us is so precious a heritage from past&quot; strugglesand sacrifices of our forebears. The British Foreign Secretary said in the Houseof Commons only a few days ago, &quot; the people everywhere want to live in freedom,justice and individual security, and to be able to go home, turn the key in thelock and not be troubled by the secret police.&quot;We are gathered in this Conference to-day from all parts of the world,representing almost every nation, representing different sects, representingemployers and workers, representing Governments, and no one need look over hisshoulder before speaking his mind in this Conference. If only we could get inevery country of the world the standard of freedom that we all take and enjoyat this International Labour Conference, if only we could get that standard of freedom in every country of the world, we should not need to fear for the future.The people of Britain salute this Conference and its President, because inthis freedom we think lies the hope for the happiness of the common people theworld over.(C)Speech of the United Kingdom Delegate to the International LabourConference, Wednesday, 9th July, 1947Extract from Provisional Record for Wednesday, 9th July, 1947SIR GUILDHAUME MYRDDIN-EVANS (Government Delegate, UnitedKingdom) : The United Kingdom Government welcomes this Convention. it covers a very wide field and very many subjects. The key to what follows willbe found in Article 4 of the Convention which states : &quot; All possible steps shallbe taken by appropriate international, regional, national and territorial measuresto promote improvement in such fields as public health, housing, nutrition,education, the welfare of children, the status of women, conditions of employ-ment, remuneration of wage earners and independent producers, the protectionof migrant workers, social security, standards of public services and-generalproduction.&quot;The Conference will note that that is all-embracing, and in all those fields theGovernment of the United Kingdom can say positively that they are doing everything that lies within their power.I hope the Conference will bear with me for just a few minutes while Imention certain facts which, had time permitted, my Parliamentary Secretary,the Right Hon. Ness Edwards, would have given to the Conference when he spoke last week. I do not propose to give^ neither would the Conference wishit-a statement of the measures taken by the United Kingdom to help the Colonialpeoples along the road of social and economic development, and the means takento associate the peoples themselves in the framing and execution of all such
measures towards that better life and improved conditions for which they canrightly look. The loyalty to Great Britain displayed by Colonial peoples duringthe war is a demonstration of the success of what has been accomplished. Theprovision of money alone does not necessarily raise the standard of living,especially in the case of the more primitive peoples. Our aim is to train thecommunity to look after its own affairs so that it can take an intelligent interestand play its part in Government, and., by means of higher education, producelocal leaders for responsible posts in Government and other employment, who,in that way will be prepared for the responsibility of self-government andpartnership which is the goal of all democratic development.The Conference will be aware that very substantial sums are being spenton all forms of education out of the  120 million which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have made available for Colonial development and welfare by the colonial development and Welfare &quot;Act of 1945.I should just like to make reference to the very far-reaching plan justannounced by the British Government for the development of colonial resources.By a special Act of Parliament, a Colonial Development Corporation withborrowing powers up to a total of  100 million will come into being. TheCorporation will have authority &quot; to establish or assist any enterprise in thecolonies which is designed to increase their general productive capacity.&quot; Itwill be a trading corporation working on commercial principles, but its opera-tions will require the preliminary consent of the Secretary of State and of theColonial Government concerned, a condition imposed in order to ensure -thatthe proposed enterprises are conducted in the best way suited to promote the welfare of colonial peoples. The activities of the Corporation will be mainlyagricultural and arrangements will be made for the taking over of great schemesof production such as the ground-nut scheme of Tanganyika Territory, fromwhich not only the peoples of East Africa but the world at large will benefit.The new Corporation will permit development policies framed under the Act of1945 to which I have referred to concentrate on basic services.This Convention is the result of more than three years&apos; devoted and patientwork on the part of all sections in this Organisation. We believe that it will bea most valuable international instrument and will improve the lives and increasethe happiness of the vast millions of people of non-metropolitan territories.APPENDIX II(A)Resolution on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right toOrganise and to Bargain CollectivelyExtract from Provisional RecordWhereas the Preamble to &quot;the Constitution of the International LabourOrganisation expressly declares &quot; recognition of the principle of freedom of association &quot; to be a means of improving conditions of labour and of establishingpeace; andWhereas the Declaration of Philadelphia reaffirms that &apos;,&apos; freedom of expression and of association are essential to sustained progress &apos;&apos; and recognises the solemn obligation of the International Labour Organisation to further amongthe nations of the world programmes which will achieve, among other things :&quot; the effective recognition of the right of collective bargaining, the co-operationof management and labour in the continuous improvement of productive efficiency,and the collaboration of workers and employers in the preparation and applica-tion of social and economic measures &apos;&apos;; andWhereas it also affirms that the principles set forth in this Declaration are fully applicable to all peoples everywhere and that, while the manner of their application must be determined with due regard to the stage of social andeconomic development reached by each people, their progressive application topeoples who are still dependent, as well as to those who have already achieved self-government,, is a matter of concern to the whole civilised world; andWhereas standards of living, normal functioning of national economy and social and economic stability depend to a considerable degree on a properlyorganised system of industrial relations founded on the recognition of freedom of association; and
Whereas, moreover, in many countries, employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisa-tions have been associated with the preparation and application of economic and social measures; andWhereas the International Labour Conference, the Regional Conferences ofthe American States Members of the International Labour Organisation and thevarious Industrial Committees have, in numerous Resolutions, oalled the attentionof the States Members of the International Labour Organisation to the need for establishing an appropriate system of industrial relations founded on theguarantee of the principle of freedom of association.The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation : -Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the InternationalLabour Office, and having met in its Thirtieth Session on 19th June,1947,adopts this 11th day of July of the year one thousand nine hundred and forty-seven, the following Resolution : I. Freedom of Association1. Employers and workers, without distinction whatsoever should have theinviolable right to establish or join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation.2. Employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations should have the right to draw up their constitutions and rules, to organise their administration and activities andto formulate their programmes; there should be no interference on the part of thepublic authorities which would restrict this right or impede the organisations inthe lawful exercise of this right.3. Employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations should not be liable to be dis^solved or have their activities suspended by administrative authority.4. Employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations should have the right to establishfederations and confederations as well as the right of affiliation with interna-tional organisations of employers and workers.5. The guarantees defined in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 herein with regard tothe establishment, functioning, dissolution and suspension of employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations should apply to federations and confederations of suchorganisations.6. The acquisition of legal personality by employers&apos; and workers&apos; organi-sations should not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrictfreedom of association as hereinbefore defined.7. The acquisition and exercise of the rights as outlined in this part shouldnot exempt the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations from their full share of responsibilities and obligations.II. Protection of the Right to Organise and to Bargain Collectively8. There should be agreement between organised employers and workersmutually to respect the exercise of the right of association.9. (1) Where full and effective protection is not already afforded appro-priate measures should be taken to. enable guarantees to be provided for : \(a) the exercise of the right of freedom of association without fear of intimidation-dation, coercion or restraint from any source with the object of: (i) making the employment of the worker conditional on his not joining a trade union or on his withdrawing from a trade union of which heis a member;(ii) prejudicing a worker because he is a member or agent or.official of a trade union;(iii) dismissing a worker because he is a member or agent or official of a tradeunion.(&amp;) the exercise of the right of association by workers&apos; organisations in sucha way as to prevent any acts on the part df the employer or employers&apos; organi-sations or their agents with the object of : (i) furthering the establishment of trade unions under the domination ofemployers;
(ii) interfering with the formation or administration of a trade union orcontributing finanpial or other support to it;(iii) refusing to give practical effect to the principles of trade union recog-nition and collective bargaining.(2) It should be understood, however, that a provision in a freely concludedCollective agreement making membership of a certain trade union a condition precedent to employment or a condition of continued employment does not fall within the terms of this Resolution.10.- Appropriate agencies should be established, if necessary, for thepurpose of ensuring the protection of the right of association as defined in paragraph 9 herein.(R)Resolution Concerning International Machinery for SafeguardingFreedom of Association&apos; Extract from Provisional record the Conference,(1) Recalling the references to freedom of association in the Declaration ofPhiladelphia and the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation,reaffirms belief in and attachment to the principle of freedom of association in allcountries as an essential element in those wider personal freedoms which are the foundation of peace, prosperity and happiness;(2) Is concerned at the widespread reports that conditions may exist pre-judicial to freedom of association in many countries;(3) Feels that steps should be taken to encourage, expand and universallyestablish freedom of association both by reminding Governments of all States,whether Members of the I.L.O. or not, of their obligations in this respect under theConstitution of the I.L.O. and/or the Charter of the United Nations, and by otherpracticable means;(4) Tn this connection has noted with interest the proposals made by theY/.F.T.U. and the A.F. of L. for the establishment of international machineryfor safeguarding freedom of association and feels that these proposals deserveclose and careful examination.(5) Recognises that the proposals raise issues of great complexity and difficulty including for example,(i) questions involving the sovereignty of States;(ii) the relationship of any such machinery to the proposals&apos; under examina-tion by the United Nations for giving effect to a Bill of Rights and establishing machinery for supervising the exercise of other funda-- ,mental freedoms, including freedom of speech, of information andof lawful assembly;(iii) the composition, scope, powers (including powers of enquiry andinvestigation) and procedure of the proposed machinery;(iv) the authority under which the proposed machinery would act.(6) Considers it essential to give to such questions, which, may involveChanges in the inter-relationship of States, the detailed examination and carefulpreparation which they merit and without which any international action wouldbe bound to fail and likely to leave the situation worse than it is at present.(7) Recognises however that the establishment in consultation with theUnited Nations of permanent international machinery may be an indispensablecondition for the full observance of freedom of association throughout the world and that any such machinery should, if established, operate under the guaranteesprovided by the tripartite Constitution of the International Labour Organisation.(8) Accordingly requests the Governing Body to examine this question in all its aspects and to report back to the Conference at the 31st Session in 1948.
