At the meeting on Balance of Payments on 20th August,--the Lord President suggested that among the measures we should consider was the abolition of the basic petrol ration.as fromthe 30th September.      I have now examined the matter further and the best plan will be for me to set out the arguments forand against this change for my colleagues&apos; consideration.2. At the present time the basic.ration takes about900,000 tons of motor spirit annually.      This total will bereduced to 600,000 tons by the cut already announced to operatefrom the 1st October.      If the reduced basic ration were abolished, some petrol allowance would be required by thosewho at present use their basic ration for semi-essentialpurposes, particularly people in rural areas.     However, we might expect that the abolition of the basic ration would saveus about 500,000 tons of petrol a year, costing about  millions in dollars at to-day&apos;s increased prices.3* There are three main arguments against this change:-(i)    The immediate issue of new supplementary allowances would place a burden on the depleted staff ofpetroleum officers;    for a time more staff might berequired and there might be some delay in dealingwith applications and inconvenience to applicants.(ii)   A further burden would be placed on the alreadystrained resources of the public service vehicles.(iii)   There might be considerable repercussions on the motorcar industry:    home orders for cars would probablybe cancelled on a considerable scale, and to theextent that either the export trade was unable to absorb the cars so released by the home market, orthe motor car manufacturers were unable to turn to the production of, say, agricultural machinery,there might be some unemployment in Coventry,Birmingham, Oxford and certain other places.I would not regard the first objection as insuperable:    theother two are mainly for the Minister of Transport and theMinister of Supply-respectively.     I am sorry there has been no time for me to consult them and embody their views in this note,but they will no doubt develop the case as may be necessary at our meeting on the 25th August.
k* In favour of the abolition of the basic ration are thefollowing considerations:-(i)    It would undoubtedly do a great deal to bring home to members of the public a full sense of the urgency ofthe situation and without injuring any reallyessential need.(ii)    It would provide a not insignificant saving in dollars and relief on tanker capacity, which is atpresent very short.. (iii)    It would help us to deal more effectively with the black-market in industrial petrol, v/hich so longas there is a basic ration at all, however small, isvery difficult to combat.5* I have considered whether a better alternative wouldnot have been to concentrate on securing economies on the supplementary allowances and have decided that, while,in any event the Ministry of Fuel and Power will continue to do allit.can in the matter, the results that con be secured are too small to count as a serious contribution in the presentsituation.- and moreover, on announcement of action limited tothis objective would have little or no effect on the state ofpublic opinion about the present crisis.     Moreover, thereduction of the supplementaries, which always have some element of essential need in them, must always be particularly difficultso long as pleasure motoring is allowed to continue.6. To sum up,  it would not, I think, be impracticable to abolish the basic ration with effect from 30th September:there are objections to that course which concern otherMinistries;   but, for my port, if my colleagues, viewing thesituation as a whole, feel that it demands this drastic step(which must necessarily arouse some public resentment) I wouldnot oppose it.      If the change is to be mode, then for a numberof reasons the sooner the announcement is made, the better.E. S.Ministry of Fuel and Power,7, Millbonk, S.W.1.22nd August,  1947.
