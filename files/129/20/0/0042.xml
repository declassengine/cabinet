I submit &quot;the follov/ing asstatement of the possibilities in thiaction which is-being taken.held on the 20th Augustout of the balance ofe to the possibility ofpayments with the Unitedry products from thea preliminary and generals direction and of the2. The Secretary of State, for the Colonies has already had some correspondence with the Foreign Secretary .and other ministers on this general subject, and has expressed himself as in entire agreement with the idea that we should try.to re-establish, and indeed improve upon,  the pre-war position inwhich exports of primary produce from the Colonies to Americawere among our principal earners of dollars, the Colonies ingeneral having a large favourable balance with dollar countrieswhich they spent mainly in the sterling area.3*Practical possibilities fall under three heads:-(i)    Cases in which increased supplies could be madeavailable .at once for sale to the United States if that country were prepared to import more.     The only important commodityin this class is rubber, but it is one of very great importance.American imports of rubber are being artificially restricted by the continued requirement by Government regulation that theproportion of natural rubber used by American manufacturersshall not exceed 50 per cent., the balance being synthetic.If this requirement were removed and the respective&apos; shares of natural and synthetic rubber in the market were determined bycompetition, a substantial increase in the   purchases of naturalrubber would result.     Possibly America could absorb an additional250,000 tons per annum, which alone would be worth about$75 millions.      In addition,  some improvement of&quot; the price wouldbe probable.     The dollar gain would not all accrue to british territories as some of &quot;the additional rubber would eome fromthe Netherlands East Indies and possibly Slam and French Indo-China, but the improvement in the financial position of thosecountries would itself be indirectly to our advantage.
Pressure has already been exercised on the Americans at the rubber Study Group and elsewhere to remedy the   presentsituation, which is contrary to the spirit of American policyin relation to I.T.O. etc.,  as hitherto little success hasbeen obtained.     A high level approach&apos;related to the present crisis might be more successful.      In addition to therestoration of free competition between natural and syntheticrubber an attempt might be made to obtain an undertaking topurchase additional quantities to put   into an enlargedstrategic stockpile.(ii)    Cases in which no immediate   increase*in totalColonial output is possible, but increased supplies could bemade available to America by restriction of United Kingdompurchases.     These include cocoa-, of which the United kingdom is consuming more than before the- war, and where the transferof,  say, 10,000 tons (less than 10 per cent, of our consumption)to the American market would mean earning some $6 millions.Other possibilities are sisal, West African timber, hides andskins and tin, but in the case of these raw materials it maybe better that the present quantities should continue to. be imported into this country with a view to ultimate re-exportin manufactured&apos;&apos; form. ;(iii)    Cases in which there are longer term possibilitiesof expansion of Colonial output over a period of years, e,g.tin, copper, lead and   other minerals.     In these cases, oneof the initial difficulties is the provision of the necessarycapital equipment for the increase of production, which meansan additional call on available capital goods.h. Action which is already in hand, or is now proposed,includes -(i)   Appeals for greater effort in production,     Anumber of such appeals have been made to Colonial governments and peoples in the two years since the. war ended, and it wouldbe a mistake to expect too much from any further appeals ofthis kind.     The Secretary of State has, however, just sent out a public message to the peoples of the Colonies setting out the general facts of the economic crisis in this countryand indicating how Colonial peoples can&apos; help both by economies in imports and by increasing their production.     Opportunitywill also be taken to emphasise again the general backgroundat a Conference of African Governors which has already beenarranged to take place in November.(ii)   Examination of possibilities of the United Kingdomreleasing supplies for export to the U.S.A.      The Treasury are understood to be making arrangements for these possibilitiesto be examined in the very near future.(iii)   Examination of particular possibilities of increased production.     As a result of the correspondence with the foreign secretary already mentioned, a list prepared in the ForeignOffice of commodities of which the United States is understood to be likely to be interested in is already under examination in the Colonial Office.     The products in this category most likely to be available from the Colonies are minerals (tin, lead,copper, bauxite, diamonds, manganese, chrome), rubber, sisaland cocoa.     This examination is being linked up with the systematic survey of possibilities of increasing production of colonial products for export to the United Kingdom or elsewhere
which was initiated by the Colonial Office some time, agothrough an Inter-departmental Colonial Primary ProductsCommittee.      That Committee is now being asked to giveimmediate attention to the    products likely to be of special interest from the point of view of export to America.     special attention is. also being given to steps which could be taken for the increase of Colonial gold output.(iv)   Expediting of projects already in hand*     The twomost important things here are- the rehabilitation of the malayan tin industry and the development of the lead depositsin Tanganyika-.     In both cases progress is held up bydifficulties in securing delivery of equipment and iri thelatter by difficulties of securing technical staff.     other ministers have already been asked to give help, in gettingover these difficulties and an indication that high priority should be attached to meeting these, needs would be of  -assistance.I.T.Colonial Office, S.W. 1.,23rd August, 194 7*
