Germany&apos;s Place in the New europe the last time the leaders of the great war-timecoalition of the United Kingdom, the United States and soviet Russia met was at Potsdam in 1945 when they signedan agreement laying down the joint and individual policiesthey would pursue in Germany during the first stages of theoccupation. Vanquished Germany, already carved up intofour Zones of Occupation, was to be disarmed, demilitarisedand denazified. Nevertheless, she was to be administeredcentrally, as well as regionally, and helped to attain responsibleself-government. Economically, she was to be treated as asingle unit and led into the ways of peaceful industry so thatshe could eventually play her part in the reconstruction ofEurope. When making this agreement the Western Powersassumed that co-operation would continue between the fourOccupying Powers. Had this assumption proved correct, theproblem of German re-armament would not now have arisen.The years which followed the Potsdam Agreement witnessedthe breakdown of the common aims and purposes which had won the war. Those years were marked, on one side, by thedisarmament of the Western Powers and their rapid return tothe arts of peace and, on the other side, by the expansion of communism, the systematic penetration of Soviet Russia&apos;sneighbours, their gradual conversion into satellites of Moscow,and the encouragement of local wars, e.g. in Greece and, later,in Korea.
Nowhefe was the breakdown in the unity of the wartimecoalition more evident than in Germany. In western germany, the Occupying Powers sought, from the beginning,to ally the developing German democratic forces to thegovernment of their own country and to give them increasingpolitical responsibilities as they showed themselves able tobear them. In the economic field, every attempt was madeto feed, the starving German population and gradually toraise their standard of living. Meanwhile, the Russianauthorities were manipulating the political life of their Zoneby the creation of a subservient political party. Theygradually liquidated all political groups who were not willingto co-operate with their Communist-dominated organisation,at the head of which they placed two Germans who had become Russian citizens. In the economic field, SovietRussia extracted reparations in the form not only of industrial equipment but also current production and refused to implement the fundamental economic principle of the potsdam Agreement, namely that Germany be treated as asingle economic unit. The United States Secretary of State,Mr. Marshall, said in London in December 1947 that sincethe war the Soviet Union were extracting assets from theirZone at the rate of over  125,000,000 a year. During thattime, we, the Americans and the French were pouring vastsums into Western Germany. From 1945 to 1949 we put ina net sum of  201,800,000.We could not continue to bear this burden, nor could theWestern Allies afford to see their Zones of Occupation sinkinto economic and social chaos. Failing agreement with soviet Russia on the future treatment of Germany, a series of measures for economic and political rehabilitation were takenin the Western Zones of Germany which resulted eventuallyin the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany in1949. Every attempt was made to associate the Eastern Zonewith these developments.   Not only were these attempts
unsuccessful but the Soviet authorities tried to y^event the developments in the West by blockading Berlin from June1948 until May 1949. This challenge was defeated by theairlift, but it made it clear to the free world that it had need to look to its military strength in the face of a developingRussian menace.The Berlin blockade also made it obvious that the defenceof Western Europe had to be undertaken in Berlin and in western Germany. Could this, however, be done alone bythe slowly gathering strength of the Western Powers, a large part of whose forces were already fighting communismelsewhere, e.g., in Malaya and Indo-China and later in Korea?Or was a new source of strength to be found by tappingGerman manpower and industrial resources and adding themto those of the West? The problem which faced the western powers in 1949 and 1950, therefore, was whether or not theGerman Federal Republic should be encouraged to participate in her own defence, and under what conditions. There was great reluctance to envisage the prospect of a re-armedGermany. No decision had been reached when the outbreakof the Korean War in June 1950 placed a large added burdenupon the resources of the Western Powers and brought outonce again the weakness of the German position. It alsoshowed clearly the dangers of a Western withdrawal from adivided country next to the Soviet bloc.Tlae SoSnflttomIn September 1950, the Foreign Ministers of the three western Powers declared in New York that any attack againstthe German Federal Republic or Berlin, from any quarter,would be considered an attack upon themselves. They also agreed to study the problems of the participation of theGerman Federal Republic in the common defence of Europe.This first step was followed, at the Brussels meeting inDecember, with instructions to the Allied High commissioners in Germany to discuss with the German Federal Government

(a) the change from an occupation regirif&amp;to freerelations of partnership, and(b) the question of a German defence contribution.These discussions were made easier by the French proposalto establish a European Defence Community of those countrieswhich were already negotiating to pool their coal and steelresources. By autumn 1951 enough progress had been madefor the three Western Foreign Ministers to agree on a solution.At their meeting in Washington, on 14th September, theydeclared that &quot; their Governments aim at the inclusion of a democratic Germany on a basis of equality in a ContinentalEuropean Community which itself will form a part of aconstantly developing Atlantic Community . . . the participation of Germany in the common defence shouldnaturally be attended by the replacement of the presentOccupation Statute by a new relationship between the three governments and the German Federal Republic.&quot; this solution was eventually embodied in a series of agreementssigned at Bonn on 26th May, 1952, and the Treaty setting upthe European Defence Community (E.D.C.) signed in Parison the following day with a protocol between the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) and the E.D.C. anda treaty between Britain and the E.D.C. These agreements were approved by Parliament on 1st August, 1952.This solution is the logical development of the policy ofthe Western Allies in Germany. Because the RussianGovernment refused to implement the Potsdam policy of treating Germany as a whole, the Western Occupying powers were left with the alternatives of continuing the occupation in its full rigour until the Russian Government changed theirmind or of helping the Germans to rehabilitate themselves and become useful and co-operative members of the western european society. The first alternative was impracticablebecause such an occupation could not continue indefinitelyseven years after the war.   It would have encouraged just
those A-eme elements in Germany which would like to destroy^all prospect of democratic government. The second alternative was therefore adopted until Russian policy makespossible the conclusion of a peace treaty and the re-unification of Germany, and Germany can determine her own policy.German Be-armameiit under SafeguardsWhy, it may be asked, should we, only a few years after theconclusion of the war, agree to Germany contributing to western defence? Might not this contribution develop intoa new danger to us and to Western Europe?The need for a military contribution from Western Germanyonly arises from our determination to deter further Russianexpansion into Western Europe before it is too late. once we had decided that Western Germany and Berlin must be defended the question arose: Who is to do the defending?Were we to send more British soldiers to risk their lives todefend German territory while German youth stood aside?Were our manpower and our industry to devote a large shareof their capacity to producing armaments to defend germany in order that German manpower and industry might be free to concentrate on peaceful production for export in competition with British goods? Were British taxpayers to bear a heavy burden of defence expenditure while German taxpayersescaped a similar burden? Mr. Bevin&apos;s answer to thesequestions was given in the House of Commons on 29thNovember, 1950: &quot;If Western Germany is to be defended,it seems to us only fair and reasonable that the Germanpeople should help in their own defence.&quot;The British Government, then as now, fully appreciated,however, that Western Germany should not be allowedsimply to recreate a national army and to re-build her war industries. That is the proposal which the RussianGovernment recently put forward, entirely in accordance withthe action they have already taken in the Eastern Zone. TheBritish Government, for their part, have insisted that the
German military contribution must be made in su( j way&apos;that it could be both safe and effective:  they agreed to german re-armament only under safeguards.In the first place, Germany is to have no national army,but is to make military, naval and air contributions to theE.D.C. forces. These contributions cannot be much morethan one quarter of the total E.D.C. strength. The E.D.C.forces themselves will form part of the N.A.T.O. forces andwill be at the disposal of the Supreme Allied CommanderEuropean Theatre.In the second place, the organisation of the E.D.C. itselfensures that the armed forces of its members cannot act independently on any large scale. This, of course, appliesequally to the German contribution:(a) The largest German unit will be a small division of12-13,000 men with the minimum of supporting services.(b) German divisions will be integrated with divisions of different nationalities in Army Corps.(c) They will depend for their tactical and administrativesupport upon integrated units under Corps control.(d) An international Board of Commissioners will beresponsible for training, organisation andappointments.(e) The forces will be paid from, a common budget.(/) There will be a common supply of arms andequipment.(g) Arms production will take place only under specificorders from the international Board.FlaassaietsaE ImplfcaiioiasThe local costs of British armed forces stationed in Germanyhave hitherto been met out of occupation costs paid by theGerman taxpayers.   Now that the occupation of Western
Ger/^sy will be brought to an end by the new agreements and&apos;^germany will cease to be an occupied country, she will no longer pay occupation costs. Instead, she will make a financial contribution to the common budget of the E.D.C.out of which her own military contribution will be financed.Is not the net result of German membership in the E.D.C.therefore to transfer the cost of keeping British armed forcesin Germany to the British taxpayers? Will this not mean alarge increase in the demand for foreign currency andconsequently have an adverse effect on the balance of payments ?Such questions are misleading because they fail to take intoaccount the overall financial implications of a commonWestern European defence. We are committed to an effectivejoint defence of Western Europe and for this purpose haveincreased our armed forces. The formation of the Germancontingents will in fact provide an increase in the level of western European defence not only militarily but financiallybecause, on the basis of an assessment of her capacitycomparable to that applied to N.A.T.O. powers, germany will contribute much more to European defence than she hasbeen paying in occupation costs. Moreover, Germany has undertaken to spend part of her defence contribution on thesupport of non-E.D.C. troops in Germany, which of courseinclude British forces.The total cost of Western Defence for the year beginningJune 1953 will be reviewed by N.A.T.O. The results maynot be available until January or February of next year.The German defence contribution after June 1953 will be examined in the same way as that of the N.A.T.O. countries.The division of this contribution between E.D.C. and otherforces stationed in Germany (including British forces) willalso have to be agreed.The British Government have made it clear that they couldnot shoulder any additional burdens on defence, particularlyin foreign currency.
Until June 1953, the position concerning the GT Vandefence contribution is clear. Until the new agreements%omeinto force the local costs of our forces in Germany will continueto be met as occupation costs. From then until June 1953,they will be met from that part of the German denfence contribution allocated for the purpose.Western   Germany   as   part   of   WesternEuropeCould not the risks involved in re-arming Germany be avoided by abandoning plans for a German denfence contribution and for the defence of Germany and allowingher to assume a position of neutrality ?To neutralise Western Germany would be to create avacuum between the Soviet Bloc and Western Europe. Thisvacuum would soon be filled and it is extremely unlikely thatsuch a neutralised Western Germany would ever secure the.unification of the whole of Germany except on terms dictated by the Communists. The German Federal Government were well aware of this when they asked the Western Powers to guarantee their territory against attack &quot; from any quarter &quot;.The integration of Germany in Western Europe presentsadvantages other than purely military and economic ones.Have we not all suffered because of Franco-German rivalries ?Should we not rejoice therefore to see these two countries linkthemselves closely in a Western European society and pooltheir vital coal and steel industries and their armed forces under a supra-national authority? The Government haveindeed encouraged the participation of the German federal government in the economic and military partnerships of the schuman Plan and the E.D.C. and have proposed that theyshould be brought within the Council of Europe in order that britain and other members of the Council of Europe may be associated in their work.
iflnsaftEcmrme with Soviet Russia t&amp; ContinueIt has been said that Germany was divided because europe was divided. If the division of Germany is made more permanent through the close association of the german federal Republic with the West, is the result likely to be alsoa permanent division of Europe and the abandonment of all hope of successful negotiations with the U.S.S.R. ?The division of Germany was never envisaged by theWestern Occupying Powers. The Potsdam Agreement was based on the idea of Germany as a unit. The SovietGovernment were as opposed to German unity as they were opposed to European unity. They refused to implement the potsdam Agreement and rejected every subsequent offer tomerge the Zones of Occupation in Germany for economic or political purposes. They also tried to prevent the WesternOccupying Powers from taking common action to rehabilitateWestern Germany, just as they refused the Marshall Plan andtried to undermine the subsequent efforts at united action forthe economic recovery of Europe. If no positive resultstowards German unity or European unity were achievedduring the first four years after Potsdam, it was not for want of trying. The Council of Foreign Ministers held 233meetings; their Deputies for Germany held 140.If the Russians opposed the treatment of Germany as a unit because they feared she might one day re-arm and growin strength, they should have said so and adequate safeguardscould have been worked out. In fact, in the summer of 1946,the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Byrnes, made aproposal for the political neutralisation of Germany and afifty-year guarantee of disarmament, provided the russians would agree to the treatment of Germany as one economic unit. The Soviet Government refused. The conclusion isinescapable that the Russians were interested not in Germanunity, but in the absorption of Eastern Germany into theSoviet system.
Progress in the economic and rjolitical rehabilitation of western Germany could therefore be made only withoutSoviet co-operation. The British and American governments had no alternative to the complete breakdown of their zones of Occupation in Germany except their economic fusion andthe gradual transfer of political power to the germans themselves. Inevitably, this led to the formation of theFederal Republic of Germany, the definition and limitationof the rights of the Occupying Powers in the occupation statute, the termination of the state of war with Germany,and this most recent step, which is the nearest substitute for a peace Treaty, the new Agreements with the German federal republic which bring the Occupation to an end. This step isthe logical and inevitable consequence of the decision takenin 1947 to proceed in Germany without the co-operation of soviet Russia. The treatment of the whole of Germany as one state, politically and economically, has always been the aim of the British Government and Soviet Russia was givenopportunities to join in at every stage since 1945.The Soviet Government have opposed unity in Germanyand in Europe, because unity makes for strength and disunityoffers opportunity for political penetration and the extensionof political influence from Moscow. In 1947, the adoptionof the Marshall Plan and the establishment of O.E.E.C., inspite of the Russian refusal to co-operate, marked thebeginning of Western European integration with the help ofthe United States. This was followed by the Brussels treaty between the United Kingdom, France and the benelux countries in March 1948. The Russian imposition of theblockade of Berlin and the coup d&apos;etat in Czechoslovakialater in 1948 crystallised the opposition between the Russianpolicy of vassal nations and satellites and the western european principle of free alliance and close co-operationbetween peoples. As Mr. Eden said in the recent debate inthe House of Commons on 31st July, 1952, the defeat of the
Berlili-.v3ckade marked the turning point in post-war history.The North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1948 and the western european nations proceeded to draw closer together to increase their common strength in a common purpose to deny furtherFoissian encroachment upon free Europe and thereby to deter aggression and preserve peace.Developments in Western Germany kept pace with these developments in Western Europe, and the German federal republic played its part in bringing about closer european unity. Experience since the war has shown that disunity ofthe Western European nations and of Germany was a source of weakness exploited by the Soviet Government throughlong-drawn negotiations leading to no practical results. Onthe other hand, when the Western Powers closed their ranks and showed firmness, there was no widening of the breachbetween Western Europe and the Soviet Bloc which had been created by Russian policy in the years immediately after thewar. On the contrary, firmness not only halted the victoriousmarch of Russian imperialism but also caused the RussianGovernment to suggest negotiations and to champion thecause of German unity. The conditions they place upon the achievement of such unity are still unacceptable to theGermans, as well as to the Western Powers, because they wouldresult in the re-establishment of external control on Germanaffairs and facilitate the Communist penetration of the wholeof Germany. They proposed the early conclusion of a peace treaty, but they would give Germany a new national armyand, at the same time, deny her the right to enter into collective agreements for her own defence.The Soviet proposals put the cart before the horse. TheBritish Government want Four-Power talks, but before a peace treaty can be negotiated, an all-German Government must beset up. This can only be done through genuinely free elections and the essential first step is therefore to decide whetherconditions  now  exist  for  such  elections.  The  British
Governments proposals, which provide for an ^Jlieciiatemeeting, are that these questions should be discussed in theright order, putting first things first.If the Russians had really wanted German unity, if their opposition to German re-armament and the integration ofGermany in Western Europe had been genuinely based onthe fear that these steps would hinder the achievement ofGerman unity, they could easily have dissuaded the western powers from taking any irrevocable steps by agreeing to anyof the three agenda for a Four-Power Conference which we proposed at the abortive discussions in Paris last year. Theycan still enter into negotiations for the unity of Germany on terms which will ensure the freedom of Germany. nothing in the new agreements with the German Federal Republicwill prevent such negotiations being held, and, let us hope,brought to a successful conclusion.Prepared for Her Majesty^ government by the Foreign Office and the Central Office of information to be purchased directly from Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office at the following addresses:York House, Kingsway, London, W.C.2 ; 423 Oxford Street, London, W.1 ; 13a CastleStreet, Edinburgh 2 ; 39 King Street, Manchester 2 ; 2 Edmund Street, Birmingham 3 ;1 St. Andrew&apos;s Crescent, Cardiff; Tower Lane, Bristol, 1 ; 80 Chichester Street, Belfast ;or through any booksellerPrice d. net.

GERMANVS PLACE IN THE NEW europe the problem by the end of 1947, according to Mr. Marshall, United States Secretaryof State, Soviet Russia was taking over  125 million a year out oftheir Zone of Germany while we, the Americans and French werepouring vast sums into Western Germany. From 1945 to 1949 we put in over  200 million.Yet Germany was barely kept going by this British and Americanmoney because she was divided into four economic areas. We,the Americans and the Russians, had agreed in Potsdam to treatGermany as one whole, but the Russians refused to carry out thisagreement.To relieve this burden on the British taxpayer, we agreed withthe Americans and the French to unite those parts of Germany under our control. The Russians tried to stop us by blockading Berlin.The airlift beat the blockade, but we knew then that we must delayno longer building up a strong defence system in Western Germany.The problem we faced in 1949 was whether and under what conditions the new German Federal Republic should contribute tothat defence.The  SolutionBy November, 1950, it was agreed that Western Germany wouldhave to help defend herself. But it was not till a year later thatit was decided to recruit Germans to form part of a European Army.On 1st August, this year, Parliament approved agreements, signed on the 26th and 27th May, which provided for the inclusion of a democratic Germany in the European Defence Community.German    I&amp;e-armament   under   Safe-guardsBritish Governments, past and present, have hesitated to accepta German share in Western defence because of the risk that suchparticipation might in time develop as a danger to Western Europe.But what was the alternative? Could the Government ask Britishparents to send their sons to defend Germany while German youthstood aside? Could the Government see Germany exporting goods to traditional British markets while our manpower and industry were diverted to defence? No! As Mr. Bevin said in November,1950, &quot; If Western Germany is to be defended, it seems to us only fair and reasonable that the German people should help in theirown defence &quot;.So the Government agreed that Western Germany should bere-armed, but under safeguards.   What are these safeguards?(a) Germany is to have no separate national Army: german armed forces will be merged in the forces of the European defence community (E.D.C.) which in turn will form part of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) forces.(b) The largest German unit will be a small division of 13,000 men.These divisions will be integrated with other divisions of differentnationalities in Army Corps which will control their tactical andadministrative support. Training, organisation and appointmentswill be under an International Board of Commissioners. There willbe a common budget and a common supply of arms and equipment which will be under the specific direction of the International Board.F i ii a be 4? i a f ImplicationsThe local costs of British armed forces in Germany, along withthose of the other Allies, have hitherto been met out of occupation costs paid by the Germans. When the new agreements come intoforce and Germany ceases to be an occupied country she will nolonger pay occupation costs although she will pay nearly half againas much in contributing to Western defence. From this contribution,the local costs of British forces in Germany will be fully met untilJune, 1953.What will happen after that? Will the British taxpayers have tofind a large sum in foreign currency to meet these costs?Germany&apos;s contribution will be established under the same procedure as for the N.A.T.O. countries. How much of this contribution will go to meet the cost of our forces in Germany will then have to be agreed.Meanwhile, the Government have made it clear that they couldnot shoulder any additional financial burdens on defence, particularlyburdens in foreign currency.Negotiations   with   Soviet   Russia   toContinueIn 1945, the Government believed that Germany should be treated,asavyJiQi^Xhe^jOwrome
Germany&apos;s contribution will be established under the same procedure as for the N.A.T.O. countries.

The Government still believe this to-day. At every stage since 1945, Soviet Russia has had and still has every opportunityto co-operate. If Germany is still divided, it is not our fault. Literallyhundreds of meetings have been held to try and get Soviet co-operation.The fact of the matter is that the Soviet Government have usedthese meetings only to hold up constructive action and never tonegotiate an acceptable agreement. After the Russians imposed the berlin blockade, the Western Governments decided to stiffen theirdefences.What has been the result? Have the Russians become less readyto talk? On the contrary! Since it was decided that germany should take part in the European Army, the Russians have proposedtalks about a German peace treaty. Admittedly they suggested atthe same time that Germany should have a new national Army,and that former Nazis should be released.Nevertheless, in replying to the Soviet Government we have saidwe want Four-Power talks, but before a peace treaty can be negotiatedan all-German Government must be set up. This can only be donethrough genuinely free elections, and the essential first step is, therefore,to decide whether conditions now exist for such elections throughoutGermany. We have, therefore, suggested an immediate meeting with Soviet Russia to discuss these questions. We hope she will agree.Fuller information on this important topic is given in the 16-page booklet GERMANVS PLACE INTHE NEW EUROPE, obtainable price 4d. (by post, 5d.) from H.M.
