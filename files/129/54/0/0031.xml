CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 6 9C. (52) 28113th August, 1952CABINETJAPAN: JURISDICTION OVER BRITISH forces memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsNegotiations with the Japanese to define the status in Japan of United nations forces have been dragging on for some time. In agreement with commonwealth governments concerned we have maintained that all United Nations forces engagedin the war in Korea must have the same jurisdictional status in Japan. This, inpractice, means that others should enjoy the extra-territorial position which theUnited States forces already enjoy by reason of their Security Treaty with Japan.2. This Treaty is not popular in Japan, and the Americans are committed to reconsider its provisions in respect of jurisdiction in April 1953, or when the&quot; N.A.T.O. Status of Forces Agreement&quot; comes into effect, whichever is earlier.We have already agreed to accept N.A.T.O. status for our forces in Japan whenit applies to United States forces there.3. Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Japan and his Commonwealth colleaguesdo not believe that we shall secure more than N.A.T.O. status for our forces in japan. (Under N.A.T.O. status, our men are immune from local jurisdiction only when on duty; under the American/Japanese arrangements American forces arein all circumstances immune from Japanese jurisdiction.)4. Meanwhile, incidents involving our forces in Japan may occur at any time,and if they are not to be magnified into the proportions of the incident of the twoBelfast ratings I think it essential to conclude the negotiations quickly.5. I have therefore decided to make one last effort to secure the same treat-ment in Japan for our men as for the Americans, but if this fails I think we mustnegotiate an agreement on the basis of N.A.T.O. status even before this applies to the Americans. My colleagues will have seen my telegrams Nos. 3235 toSir Oliver Franks and 1217 to Sir Esler Dening, copies of which are annexed.Commonwealth Governments are being consulted: clearly we must present acommon front to the Japanese.6. Whilst I am convinced that this course is the only practicable one opento us, we must realise that (assuming the failure of the attempt to secure extra-territoriality for our forces) we may be criticised for accepting an inferior status.The reply to such charges is that the Americans enjoy a special position in Japanby reason of their Security Treaty with Japan, to which we are not a party, andthat in any case the American jurisdictional position is due for review in a fewmonths. Adverse publicity may be offset by the release of the Belfast ratings. Ihave told Sir Esler Dening that, if we do accept N.A.T.O. status, we must start with a clean sheet and the Japanese must release members of our forces alreadyimprisoned.A.

ANNEX ATelegram No. 3235 of 9th August, 1952, to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador inWashingtonThe United States forces which garrison Japan enjoy extra-territorial juris-dictional status under the United States/Japanese Administrative Agreement.Those United States forces which, like the British Commonwealth forces in Korea(B.C.F.K.), form part of the United Nations forces but who happen from time totime to be in Korea, enjoy in practice the same extra-territorial status. Under theprovisions of Article 17 of the Administrative Agreement (paragraphs 1 and 5) thisfavoured united status seems likely to end at the latest in April 1953..2. Sir E. Dening has made it plain that the Japanese, who resent the factthat the United States forces secured a special position under their AdministrativeAgreement, are determined that other United Nations forces (including B.C.F.K.)shall not have jurisdictional status more favourable than &quot; N.A.T.O. Status.&quot;Under &quot; N.A.T.O. Status &quot; the Japanese would retain jurisdiction for members ofUnited Nations forces off duty who commit offences involving Japanese persons or property. Sir E. Dening reports that this question of jurisdiction is likely to prove the most difficult in the negotiations and that it must be faced in the nearfuture, preferably next week (beginning 11th August).3. We hold to the principle that all United Nations forces engaged in the warin Korea should enjoy equal status in Japan. This means that so long as UnitedStates members of the United Nations forces enjoy extra-territorial status other united Nations forces should enjoy it also. We are willing to agree to &quot; N.A.T.O.Status &quot; for our forces when the United States accept it for theirs. The difficultyover jurisdiction is therefore likely only to relate to a period of six to nine months.4. Briefly our reasons for standing out for extra-territorial jurisdiction duringthis relatively short period are:  (a) It is wrong in principle that there should be discrimination against non-United States members of the United Nations forces over jurisdiction.Politically it would be extremely difficult for us to accept suchdiscrimination.(b) We are not asking more of the Japanese than we are ourselves willingto concede. We and the French grant extra-territorial jurisdiction to united States troops in the United Kingdom and France and will con-tinue to do so until &quot; N.A.T.O. Status &quot; comes into effect, which willprobably not be until some time next year.(c) &quot; N.A.T.O. Status &quot; is designed to apply in peace-time and in cold war conditions. The N.A.T.O. Agreement on status provides that in theevent of an emergency &quot; N.A.T.O. Status &quot; should be reviewed. Sucha review would certainly give a greater measure of extra-territorialjurisdiction. As United Nations forces are engaged in actual hostilitiesthere are grounds, on the merits of the case, for their enjoying a greater measure of extra-territorial jurisdiction than under &quot; N.A.T.O. Status.&quot;5. For these reasons I consider that we must make a further vigorous attemptto obtain Japanese agreement to equal &quot; Administrative Agreement &quot; status for allUnited Nations forces as long as Article 17 of the Administrative Agreementcontinues in force in its present form. Please approach the United States authori-ties (if you consider it desirable acting in concert with the British Joint ServicesMission) and request them to instruct their representative in Tokyo to give usstrong support on the jurisdiction issue in the negotiations with the Japanese. Ishould be grateful for your estimate of how far they are prepared to go.
ANNEX BTelegram No. 1217 of 9th August, 1952, to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador inTokyoI have considered at length this question and reached the conclusion:  (a) that we must press for the same jurisdictional position as United states forces engaged in the war in Korea, agreeing of course to N.A.T.O.Status when that also applies to United States forces;(b) if this fails, I think we must agree to N.A.T.O. status even before it applies to United States forces, but I want first to make another determined effort to secure unqualified American support on (a) above (see my telegram No. 3235 [of 8th August] to Washington);(c) if approach in (a) above fails, and we accept N.A.T.O. status, it would be conditional on starting with a clean sheet, i.e., it would be conditional on the release by the Japanese of any members of the British Common-wealth Forces, Korea, imprisoned or detained by the Japanese at thetime of the signature of the Agreement; and it would be conditionalalso on securing an understanding from the Japanese that minor cases would be handed over to our Service authorities before they came toa Japanese court.
