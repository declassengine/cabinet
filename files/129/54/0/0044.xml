70io(TE*jP DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF PIER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret the United States Mutual Security Act, 1952 provides that,8100 million of the funds appropriated by Congress for defence-support aid may be paid out only on condition thatthe counterpart in local currency is spent in ways which willstimulate free enterprise and increase productivity.    Thisprovision is in Section 11500 of the Act, known as the MoodyAmendment, which is to be read with Section 516 of the 1951 Act,the Benton Amendment.   The texts are attached at Annex B.   Mycolleagues will wish to consider whether the United kingdom should make a bid for a share of the $100 million of ConditionalAid.    This paper sets out the considerations which arise.2.     Mutual Security Administration (M.S.A.) officials in Londonhave put the United Kingdom share of Conditional Aid atpotentially about 0M\ million.    The Board of Trade inconsultation with interested departments have drawn up,in general terms, a list of projects on which the sterlingcounterpart could usefully be spent.    The projects have notbeen examined in detail and in many cases will need specificMinisterial approval.    If my colleagues accept therecommendation of this paper the intention is to put the list-to M.S.A. without commitment, as an indication of the way inwhich we think the money could be spent,,3*     The list of projects is attached at Annex A, but I donot suggest that it need be examined in detail at this stage.It raises,  however, one important point of principle whichalthough the particular concern of the President of the Boardof Trade is one on which a collective Ministerial- decision is desirable.1+.     The Benton Amendment has a number of aims including the promotion of increased productivity and free enterprise andthe discouragement of monopoly.    Senator Benton himself hasrecently been in Europe and stated that the counterpart money should be spent on &quot;inculcating anti-monopoly thinking&quot;.It is clear that any such use of the money would be inconsistent with the policy of empirical approach embodied inthe Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Act of 19^4-8.   On theother hand MJ3.A.,  though they appreciate our difficulties,would hardly&apos;be able to accept a list of projects whichignored the anti-monopoly side of the Benton Amendment.   Ithas,  therefore, been thought desirable to include in the listan integrated programme of social and economic research intoall the factors affecting the efficiency of the national economy;  this will necessarily involve factual studies of thenature and effects of monopoly and restrictive practices.8TH SEPTEMBER,  1952,CABINETCONDITIONAL AIDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer
It is thought that so long as the studies are factual and only part of a wider programme of research, there is littleclanger of conflict with Government policy on monopolies.It remains to be seen, however, whether M.8.A, will considerthat sufficient weight has been given in our list of projects to the anti-monopoly side of the Benton Amendment.5.     Apart from the particular issue of Government policy onmonopolies, I should draw attention to two possibleobjections in principle to any acceptance by the UnitedKingdom of Conditional Aids-(a) It has long been Government policy thatcounterpart funds should not be used inways which might increase inflationary pressure.    The counterpart of Marshall Aidwas consistently applied for redemption of debt while the counterpart of defence-supportaid will be applied in the current year inAppropriations--in-Aid of Defence Votes.    Ifwe accept Conditional Aid and spend thecounterpart on projects which would not otherwise have been undertaken there will bean addition to Government expenditure.(b) There is a risk that if the administrationof Conditional Aid is a success there willbe pressure in the American Congress to attach the same or other conditions to alarger proportion of total Aid in future years.In my view neither of these objections should be regardedas conclusive^   In return for additional government expenditure we shall obtain dollars which we would not-otherwise receive.    Moreover it is legitimate to expect that the national economy will derive some benefit fromthe expenditure in question.    The danger of conditionsbeing attached to American Aid has always been presentand would not necessarily be lessened by a refusal onour part to accept this year&apos;s Conditional Aid.6.     Accordingly, I recommend that a bid should be put in,on behalf of the United Kingdom generally on the lines of annex A.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.8TH SEPTEMBER,  1952*
i^MSC a proposed PjaOGRAJODj UNDER CONDITIONAL ^ID1.      introduction the unifying idea of the following programme is theimprovement of the productivity of British Industry : soas to help the country to carry out the rearmament programme and to balance its external accounts without any unduereduction in the standard of living.    It therefore consists of a number of diverse items which are all intended toincrease the ability and the willingness of British industryto produce under fully competitive conditions.    It includestraining projects for management and labour;    proposals tohelp small firms to re-equip;    provision for the developmentof technological resources and for research over a wide variety of social and economic problems which affect the willingness or the ability of management and labour to producejarrangements for advising particular firms on productiontechniques and for putting across to the nation and to industryin general the importance of raising production by every possible means.The programme is based on certain general principles.Of these the first is that the responsibility of government towards raising the production efficiency of industry is primarily for helping in making available some of the tools and services with.which industry can do the job for itself,for promoting fundamental and applied research, and for doing what it can to see that industry lias the incentive to raiseits efficiency.    In any approach to industry the government must work through, and with the co-operation of,  industrial organisations.    A great part of the following programme will therefore be carried out by such bodies as the BritishProductivity Council and business and research organisations,with arrangements for the equitable sharing of the resultsthroughout industry.Secondly, the resources of the economy, particularly inthe capital goods sector, are already fully employed.    So faras possible, therefore, the proposals have been selected so asto involve as little capital investment as possible,particularly on building labour and materials.Thirdly, the projects selected have been such that theyinvolve once-for-all expenditure on the endowment of a university Chair, a research contract or equipment, orthe initiation of services for industry of a kind whichit is to be hoped industry will subsequently be prepared to finance for itself.The programme is divided into a number of categories foreach of which several examples are quoted, together with a tentative total expenditure for the category.   Although thevarious parts of the programme are to some extent complementaryit will be possible to increase or decrease the number of projects to be included in most of the categories, or even to eliminate some of the categories altogether should they not&quot;Industry&quot; must be taken throughout this paper to includeagriculture.
oprove acceptable.   Farther consideration may also suggest theaddition of further categories of action to seek to achieve the objectives of Conditional Aid.    In particular Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment has not yet had an opportunity to consider in detail the proposals of the Ridley Committee report on national fuel policy.    It may well prove that a number of these proposals are highly desirable, but would involve considerable expenditure tomake them effective.    Opportunity might therefore be sought toinclude them in this programme, so far as they are in accordancewith the aimsB    The programme has not yet been discussed with industry, since it is uncertain whether it is likely, in wholeor in part, to be acceptable to M.S.A.,, and the result of such discussions may require it to be modified considerably,,Her MajestyJs Government must not, therefore, be regarded asbeing committed to the final approval of any particular item in the programme, or to the grant total or any of the sub-totals.Many of the items in the programme are such that if itwere not for financial stringency they would have already beenapproved as^part of ordinary Government expenditure.    her majesty&apos;s Government is glad to seize the opportunity given bythe Moody Amendment to the Mutual Security Act to put themforward now, together with additional proposals, in the belief that, presented as a project for co-operative action between government and industry during the next few years, they willcatch the public imagination and provide industry with themeans and the stimulus to raise the national production to new heights.2*      O.E.E.C.  PROJECTSThe United Kingdom would be prepared to play its part ina number of the activities sponsored by the Productivity and applied Research Committee of O.E*E.O. :    it is, however,assumed that the expenses connected with such projects arelikely to be covered by the 2-g- million dollar grant to bemade to 0,EoE.C. under the Moody Amendment.3.      EMPLOYMENT OF INDUSTRIAL CONSULTANTS AND ADVISERSCertain research and business organisations already employconsultants to advise their members, particularly the smallerfirms, on re-organisation and on productivity techniques.It is considered that this type of work could be very greatlyexpanded if the Government were to subsidise during the initial period the employment of consultants, who might be placed withresearch or business organisations if they specialised in theproblems of particular industries, or centrally with, say, theBritish Productivity Council or with the Department of scientific and Industrial Research if they specialised in techniques of application to the whole of industry (such as mechanicalhandling or fuel economy).    We believe that their activitiescould be spread over a great part of industry as well as overagriculture *Total of the order of  700,000 spread over three years.h^      SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RESEARCHIt is considered that the research at present going oninto the factors affecting the efficiency of the national economy could be usefully expanded.   Such a programme wouldrange from some medical work, on, say, design of machinecontrols and industrial fatigue problems, through research into the sociology and social psychology of the relationships between employer and employed, to pure economic, descriptive,
&quot;Part of this item may appear as a contribution by endowment to the building up, recently announced by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, of at least one institution of University rank devoted predominantly tothe teaching and study of the various formsof technology. &quot;
theoretical and statistical work on, for instance, the structure of industry and the structure and practice oftrade associations, trade unions and so on.    Such a programme would be carried out largely under contract by various bodies, including the Universities and economic orsociological institutes, and by the British Institute of management and other professional and learned societies.It would be directed essentially to finding out what makes the economy work or stops it working as well as it mightyand would inevitably deal, among other things, with suchmatters as incentives, the conventional morality of restrictive practices both by employers and by labour, theprice structure and price-fixing practices, problems of therelative efficiency of competitive and monopolistic enterprise and so on, so that it would inevitably throw up a greatamount of information which would be relevant to the purposesset out in the Benton wiendment.    It would, however, do this as part of an integrated programme of work in which the humanand economic relations of industry as a whole would be studied,rather than directing itself solely to free enterprise,monopolies and restrictive practices and thus making an endof what should be a means.Total up to  500,000 to be spent over two or three years.5*      TBGHNOLOGI CAL DEVELOPMENTThere are a number of research programmes in the hands ofGovernment Departments or Research Associations which arelikely to make a material contribution to industrial oragricultural productivity, but which have come to the stageat which rather heavy expenditure is needed if the results are to be developed into a form in which they can be broughtinto use.   Among them may be mentioned development work ontransistors and other non-electronic switching devices for industrial control gear and high-speed computing machines;development work on the combustion of solid fuels in gasturbines (of particular importance for peak-load generatorsfor industry)!    more intensive work on technical and chemicalprocessing and chemical engineering in the cotton industry!a general programme of chemical engineering research, undertaken by contracts with Universities, Government Establishments,Research Associations and individual firms, the results ofwhich will be widely disseminated with the object of increasingthe productivity of the chemical industry and encouraging themanufacture of improved chemical plant for home and export.Total about  1,000,000 to be spent over two to five years.6.      TECHNOLOGICAL TRAINING AND education the endowment, and in some cases the provision of equipment and minor building for a number of Chairs intechnological subjects at various Universities and technical colleges, the training of staff for courses for supervisors,the provision of scholarships, including scholarships for trade unionists, in management subjects and so on.    Part of-frhia ibeai may appuar-as-a contribution by endowment to the -pjj^j^e-sre d Technological Institution-of University status-.Total of the order of  2,000,000 -  3,000,000.
7.      PUBLICITYIt would be proposed, if the greater part of the programmed could be launched, to bring it to the public attention, to draw the moral and to ram the lesson home by a publicity campaignby all the means open.   One particularly effective method mightbe the organisation of local conferences or exhibits with theco-operation of industry.Total of the order of  50,000 per annum,8.     FILMSAs part of the publicity campaign, but also as part ofthe training and education courses in particular techniques itis proposed to make arrangements for facilitating the showing,in factories, public halls, at conferences and so on, of propaganda and instructional films, including the films whichhave been supplied by M.S.A.   A small number of further filmsmay be made in this country on carefully chosen subjects.Total about  250,000 spread over three years.9.      RE-EQUIPMBNT LOANS TO industry it is proposed to set up a revolving fund of  2 million tobe used for short-term loans to industry, including agriculture,for re-equipment and particularly for such ancillary plant asmechanical handling gear.    The mechanism through which the fund was applied would need careful consideration to see that theminimum disturbance to the Government&apos;s credit policy took placeaIt would be preferable for the money to be channelled through some existing organisation rather than through an entirely new body,&quot;    but these are matters that will require considerationwhen the scheme as a whole has reached the stage of detailed planning.    There should be no lack of outlets for advances fromthe fund.   In some cases these could be linked with therecommendations of the Anglo-American Council reports or of the consultants referred to in paragraph 3*    It has already beensuggested that the cotton textile industry, the builders material and brick industry, co-operative packing stations for farmers andfurther fuel saving equipment for all industry might be verysuitable candidates for help by loan.Total up to  2,000,000.&quot;10.    GENERAL PRODUCTIVITY ACTIVITIESThis is a general heading&apos;intended to cover such action by the B.P.C., B.I.M. and Government Departments and other bodies as may not come under specific paragraphs above.    Itwould include, for instance, the production of manuals on particular techniques of management and the provision of technical information officers and services.Total roughly of the order of  100,000 spread over three years.
