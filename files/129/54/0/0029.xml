Printed for the Cabinet. August 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.6 8C. (52) 2799th August, 1952CABINETNATIONALISED INDUSTRIES: PENSIONS FOR FULL-TIME MEMBERSOF BOARDSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Co-ordination ofTransport, Fuel and power invite my colleagues to rescind a decision of the Labour Government whichis causing considerable difficulty. The previous Government originally contem-plated that pensions would or might be paid to full-time members of the boards of nationalised industries. Provision was made accordingly in the Actsnationalising the fuel and power and transport industries and expectations ofpensions were held out by Ministers when appointments were made. But in1949 the Government decided that service on the Boards of these industries shouldnot be pensionable as such, and that pension rights in respect of Board service should only be allowed where members of Boards appointed from outside employ-ment had existing pension rights which could be preserved, as in the case of members appointed from the staff of the industry concerned, for whom provision had alreadybeen made in the Acts. This limitation was apparently made partly because theLabour Government at that time considered that the grant of pension rights wouldmake it more difficult to get rid of members who were unsatisfactory and partly because pensions would add greatly to the value of their salaries, which were inany case being criticised as too high.2. This decision of 1949, whatever its reasons or merits, has produced aposition which has become indefensible in practice. At present, of a number ofBoard members all receiving the same salary, some will be in the staff pension scheme, some will be earning a pension based on the salary of their old occupation,which may be much less than their Board salary, and some will not be entitledto pension at all. This is inevitably causing discontent and is adding greatly tothe difficulty of securing qualified men for these vitally important posts ofmanagerial responsibility.3. There is also the question of public faith. The Nationalisation Actsprovided powers to give pensions for Board service. Some Board membersundoubtedly took office on the assumption that these powers would be used.Indeed, a number of them claim that they had assurances from Ministers that thiswould be done.4. I realise that we cannot suddenly sweep away all these anomalies by introducing a uniform measure of pensionability. But I do not think that we can maintain the present absolute ban (subject to the exceptions I have mentioned)on the grant of pensions for full-time Board members since, as I have explained,it produces completely anomalous results. I think we must therefore contemplate the grant of pensions, subject to a general understanding in dealing with futurecases that where a man has no previous pension rights a minimum of 10 years&apos;service would be necessary to qualify for pension and that any pension would becommensurate with his years of service on a Board. We must, however, clearlyproceed with caution to avoid the criticism that the grant of pensions will meanan increase of the emoluments of these posts. I do not suggest, therefore, thatwe should announce that pensions will be given in all cases, but that we should say,if challenged, that each case is being considered on merit. In practice no doubtwe shall approve nearly all the cases in question.42742
5. I accordingly invite my colleagues to agree in principle that full-time service on these Boards should be pensionable, leaving the proposals in each case to be worked out at official level and dealt with by the issue of a Ministerialdetermination with Treasury approval, as provided for in the relevant sections ofthe Nationalisation Acts. I have discussed this matter with the Chancellor of theExchequer, who has expressed his agreement with these proposals.6. My colleagues who are concerned with other Public Boards of comparablestatus will no doubt feel that the same principles should be applied to them.L.Great George Street, S.W. 1.9th August, 1952.
