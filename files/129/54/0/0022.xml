(52) 184), about economy in theuse of office space which was approved by the Cabinet on 19th June, I undertook to report progress at the end of July (C.C. (52) 61st Conclusions, Minute 5).2. Ministers have now agreed to surrender 650,000 square feet. I am verygrateful for their help. The release of 200,000 square feet is still under discussion.I attach a statement showing the Departments with whom I am still discussingsubstantial proposals (i.e., those involving the surrender of 5,000 square feet ormore).3. The main task now is to complete the moves necessary to make the economies. I propose to report results again in six months. I should then be ablealso to report appreciable economies in provincial towns.4. It should be possible to make further savings in office accommodationas and when Departments reduce staffs. I should be grateful if Ministers would ensure that, when staffs are reduced, office accommodation is surrendered andnot absorbed by the staff who remain.D.
