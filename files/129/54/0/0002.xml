V - CABINET OFFICfc/ RECORD COPY(THIS I^pUMENI IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITAIWIGMAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(52) 252 COPY NO. ,    2 -22nd JULY. 1952.CABINETASSISTANCE FOR BUILDING FISHING VESSELS/Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Home Affairs Committee have had under consideration a schemefor Government assistance in the reconstruction of the Fishing Fleet.  Theproposals they have discussed relate both to inshore and herring boats and tothe larger vessels of the inner and middle water fleets.   Their main object is to find some financial incentive which will induce owners to scrap andrebuild.  Experience has shown that loans at normal rates of interest are notin theniselves sufficient,2, The most obvious solution is, of course, to make provision for loansat a reduced rate of interest.   But I am sure that this must be rejected.  Itwould undermine our whole credit policy.  The Treasury has enforced with       -vigour the new rates of interest and has&apos; sternly refused to make any exceptions.There is no doubt that if one were allowed the position would be weakened andwe should be faced with, demands for a host of others - ranging from local authorityloans on the one hand to the small loans which the Development Commission makesto rural craftsmen on the other.   There are many cases in which the arguments for a special rate are just as strong as, if not stronger than, they are in the caseof the fishing industry.   I am therefore convinced that it would be a grave error&apos;to solve the problem in this particular way.3. What I have said about loans at reduced rates of interest appliesequally to any of the variations of this particular type of arrangement.   Forexample, we would be equally ill-advised to agree to interest-free loans ormoratoria on interest payments (except, in the latter case, where the interest is capitalised and added to the loan).4. It was for this reason that, before the matter came to the Home AffairsCommittee at all, other means of giving special assistance in the building of the fishing vessels were canvassed.   In the case of the owner who goes to sea withhis vessel as a member of the crew, it has been agreed that part of the assistance should take the form of a grant.   It was, however, generally accepted that thisarrangement was scarcely appropriate in the case of vessels owned by companies,many of which are by no means without funds.   In the case of companies, it isin fact purely a problem of providing ah incentive to rebuild, and &quot;assistance&quot;as we normally understand it these days is probably not needed at all.  nevertheless it seems pretty clear that without a substantial financial incentive these companiesmay not rebuild their fleets.5. The Home Affairs Committee put in hand an investigation of thepossibility of solving the problem in the case of companies by paying thehciretaining fees to secure the use of their vessels in war.   But it transpired that
I the vessels in question were not those in which the Admiralty was primarily interested; moreover, it wouldnot have been possible to restrict the scheme to fishing vessels, nor would the arrangement.have provedsufficiently attractive to owners.6. The other idea which has been canvassed is that the Governmentshould give part of its assistance by taking a share in the companies owningthese vessels.  This suggestion originated with the White Fish Authority^who already have powers to take such shares.  It would be understoodthat theGoyernmeht should never acquire a controlling interest in thecompanies; but there would be the possibility of some return for the initial outlay.   From my point of view this is the only one of the various suggestions for providing special assistance which is acceptable.7. At their meeting on 8th July (H.A,(52) 19th Meeting, Minute 3)the Home Affairs Committee discussed the problem and decided that thepurchase of shares, involving the direct participation of Government in private industry, was open to grave objection.   In the end they came to theconclusion that the assistance to be given should take the form of loansat special rates of interest.   I should add that theFinancial Secretary tothe Treasury was not able to be present at the time.&apos; He conveyed my view,however, to the Committee by letter.8. I can see why the idea of shares is unattractive.   But I hope,from what I have said above, it will be accepted that the solution favoured by the Home Affairs Committee is very much more objectionable from thepoint ^f view of the national interest.   To my mind the choice lies between theadoption of the shares idea or a decision that in the case of boats owned by companies we can offer nothing more than loans at the normal rate ofinterest.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.22nd JULY, 1952.
