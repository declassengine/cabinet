Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1952SECRET Copy No.   g25th July, 1952CABINETDefence CommitteeUNITED KINGDOM DEFENCE INSTALLATIONS IN CEYLONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the R.N. and the R.A.F. maintain a number of instailations in Ceylon, ofwhich the principal are:  The harbour, dockyard and other installations at Trincomalee.The R.N. Camp at Diyatalawa.The airfield at Negombo.3 R.A.F. Signals stations.The wireless station at Anderson.2. In their Appreciation of the Military Requirements in Ceylon prepared in 1949, the Chiefs of Staff emphasised the strategic importance of Ceylon as anessential link in the air and sea communications in the Indian Ocean area, and animportant link in the Commonwealth cable and wireless network. We look to ceylon to take care of her own local defence and we are helping her to build upher own very small naval, army and air forces. But for as far ahead as we can see we shall need to use our own present naval and air establishments for strategicas opposed to local defence purposes.3. The United Kingdom/Ceylon Defence Agreement of 1947 (Appendix 1 to annex IV) provided [inter alia) that the United Kingdom might base naval andair forces and maintain land forces in Ceylon &quot; as may be mutually agreed,&quot; andthat the Ceylon Government would make the necessary facilities available. since then it has been our object to obtain from the Ceylon Government some writtensecurity of tenure in our installations. Negotiations to this end have proceededsince early 1949, but there has been no progress owing to the devious tactics ofthe Ceylon Government. A summary is at Annex I. The matter rests with a letterfrom Mr. Attlee to the late Mr. Senanayake of 23rd April, 1951 (Annex II). no reply has ever been received to that letter.4.   The position as it has remained since then is:  (a) the terms of our occupation of the lands and buildings comprising ourinstallations have remained undefined;(b) on the other hand, there is no reason to suppose that the Ceylon Govern-ment would wish to eject us (though they want us to move one or twoinstallations to alternative sites); the late Prime Minister of Ceylon,in the course of negotiations in January 1951, reaffirmed in so manywords that the United Kingdom could count absolutely on the use inpeace and war of the facilities and establishments we now occupy;(c) the previous United Kingdom Governments proposal remains on record namely, to make available certain specified equipment as and when required by Ceylon forces for their realistic expansion programmes,and to provide  800,000 worth of it as a free gift, as part of an overallsettlement; a list of the equipment so hypothecated is at Annex III the only significant item is a frigate;
5.   It is now necessary to review the position.id) As a result of the recent general election in Ceylon Mr. DudleySenanayake&apos;s Government is in a stronger position than his father&apos;s wasin 1951. His party has an overall majority and, barring accident, hisGovernment should be safe for the full 5 years. He should, therefore,be better placed to resist, if he wishes to, the political pressures of whichhis father appeared to be nervous.(b) The Ceylon High Commissioner in London recently enquired of me whythere need be further delay in finalising arrangements (he did not saythat Ceylon would give us what we wanted and it may be that he wasnot fully informed of the facts).(c) The Ceylon authorities have pressed us to say whether the offer of a frigateremains open and have made representations about inadequate suppliesof training equipment.(d) We must now consider whether, and if so when, we are to sink a substantial amount of expenditure in moving the W/T station from its present site at Anderson to a new site near Trincomalee.6. The question of moving the W/T station arises mainly because the ceylon government have throughout made it clear that they need the site (which is close to the centre of Colombo) for housing development and that we must find analternative as soon as possible. Our lease expired at the end of 1951 and our continued occupation is entirely dependent on the goodwill of the Ceylon Govern-ment. The previous United Kingdom Government undertook to vacate Andersonby 1954. This is now impossible as it will take some 5 years to build a newstation, but the Ceylon Government clearly expect us to make an immediate start.A careful survey was recently carried out, and a suitable alternative site has been selected on Ceylon Government land in the Trincomalee area. The total cost(including accommodation for staff) will be in the neighbourhood of  2 million ormore. The Admiralty are anxious, if possible, to avoid incurring this heavy expenditure at the present time of financial stringency, since it is likely that theycould only do so at the cost of other works which would contribute much more directly to our state of readiness for war. We cannot hope that the Ceylon Govern -ment would agree to our remaining at Anderson permanently or indefinitely, butit is conceivable that, especially if they receive some satisfaction from us in othermatters, they would accept, even though reluctantly, a suggestion that we shoulddefer consideration of this project for about two years, if this was represented tothem as one of the problems arising from our balance of payments difficulties andthe consequent limitations on Government expenditure A postponement of thiskind would probably rule out, for the time being, a settlement of other outstandingmatters in the defence negotiations. But, as explained in paragraph 8 below, theprospects of securing such a settlement are doubtful in any event. The Admiralty,who are principally concerned, would therefore regard negotiations of general scopeas being less important than the postponement of capital liability for the replace-ment of Anderson W/T station. At the same time it must be recognised that anysuch postponement would afford no more than a temporary relief; that we shouldbe faced sooner or later with the necessity of undertaking this very expensiveproject; and that, once started, it would in practice acquire an overriding priority over other Admiralty works in order to complete it in reasonable time. the embarrassment of accepting such a situation may be considerable at any time,though possible future difficulties do not detract from the immediate advantage of postponing the expenditure for the next two or three years.7. We shall have to deal with the recent Ceylon representations about trainingequipment and the frigate:  (i) As to training equipment, we have been providing against cash payment by Ceylon such small quantities as can be spared (see paragraph 4 id)id) meanwhile we have continued to assist the build-up of the Ceylonese forcjilby providing instructors, affording training facilities, and by meeting&apos;wherever possible, requests for training equipment on a strictly cashbasis; but because of Ceylon&apos;s low priority (in the absence of any seriousexternal threat) little or no equipment additional to training require-ments has been available even when Ceylon has been prepared to pay for it.
\%above). The small Ceylon forces are very young (they date effectivelyfrom 1948) but enthusiastic, and are training satisfactorily undercommanding officers loaned from the United Kingdom. They are entirely dependent on the United Kingdom for training supplies. Acomplete stoppage would not be likely to bring the Ceylon Governmentto heel; it would be more likely to provoke the Ceylon Governmentto retaliate against our installations where the terms of our occupationare undefined. We should, therefore, continue to supply what we can.But we should take credit for the way in which we have carried out ourobligation to provide training equipment to the best of our ability,(ii) The Ceylon authorities argue that, in the light of what was said in thecourse of the 1951 Negotiations, a frigate should be made available tothem irrespective of the state of negotiations about the bases. Theextent of our obligations arising from those negotiations is open toargument, but it is clear that, if the Ceylon Government were now toenter into a firm undertaking to carry out their share of the bargaincontemplated in Mr. Attlee&apos;s letter of April 1951, we should on our side be bound, subject to Parliamentary sanction, to transfer a frigateto Ceylon as a gift and to bear the cost of the refit that is assuming that this was counted as a part of the  800,000 worth of equipment tobe provided free of charge under such a settlement. In the absenceof any such general agreement, we are not committed to the same extent, but, as we already have a defence agreement with Ceylon, andas we are confident that she would fight at our side in a future war,we should find it difficult to explain why we should not at any ratemake one frigate available to. her on the same terms as those on whichwe have lent three to India, with whom we have no general defence agreement. The fact that India has been lent three frigates is boundto become known soon and, in the light of this and of our previous negotiations with Ceylon, it would be morally difficult to refuse to lend her a frigate on the understanding, as with India, that the ceylon government bear the cost of the refit, even though no general settle-ment of outstanding questions resulted. At least it would be reasonable to hope that such a gesture would influence the Ceylon Governmentin favour of an understanding attitude towards our particular difficultiesin making any early start on a substitute for the Anderson W/T station,(iii) The Ceylon Government have also recently made a first tentative approach to the Admiralty about help in obtaining minesweepers and navalequipment in addition to those contemplated in previous discussions.8. The United Kingdom High Commissioner thinks it unlikely that anyCeylon Government would agree to signing the sort of document we should like tohave granting us more or less indefinite security of tenure, particularly if it has to bepublished. It has been argued that we may have to be content with no writtenagreement apart from the general provisions of the 1947 Defence Agreement, whichin the light of the acceptance by the Government of Ceylon of the actual positionof our forces, installations, &amp;c. in Ceylon, give us some protection. It is true thatwe can feel reasonably confident that the present Ceylon Government wiil notdisturb us even if we have no written security; the late Mr. Senanayake was undoubtedly sincere in affirming that we could count on these facilities. More-over, although they may sometimes argue that the bases are a liability since theywould attract enemy attacks, the Ceylon Government would not wish us to leave them naked; they have told us that they are always nervous of India. In the finalanalysis we shall in any case be at the mercy of whatever Ceylon Government isin power; and any alternative Government would, it seems, be so strongly opposedto the Commonwealth connexion that it would tear up any agreement made with us. But possession of a &quot; scrap of paper &quot; granting us some security of tenure isimportant as has been shown in regard to Simonstown and is not valueless even when the host Government is ready to behave like Egypt.recommendations.   The issues before us and my recommendations are as follows:  (i) Is it necessary for us to take some new initiative in an attempt to secure a firm agreement about our tenure of the bases? It would be morecomfortable if we had such an agreement; but we are in no dange- of
being thrown out, the ball is in fact with the Ceylon Government, anj!mthere are no signs that any fresh offer would bring results now.  Wtrcan afford to wait.(ii) We are paying rent to private owners for some of the land we occupy. Wewould save this if the Ceylon Government themselves took over owner-ship (it has always been assumed that they would do so as part of ageneral settlement). But the sums involved are so small not morethan  60,000 per annum that they cannot decisively affect our policy.(iii) We must be prepared to honour, in its general scope if not necessarily indetail, the proposal made by the previous Government (see para-graph 4 (c) above), should the Ceylon Government offer an overallsettlement on that basis.(iv) The problem of the W/T station at Anderson is a very difficult one (para-graph 6). There is no doubt that we are clearly pledged to the ceylon government to make a move at the earliest possible date. I feel con-siderable reluctance about going to the younget member of theCommonwealth and explaining that the United Kingdom government must fall down on its promises. But I should be prepared to do so if itis agreed that the Admiralty arguments in favour of postponing this expenditure, if only for quite a short time, must be accepted as decisive.We must, however, expect a pretty sharp reaction in Ceylon, and perhaps some unfriendly noises in public from one or two members oftheir Cabinet. And we cannot hope for anything miore than two years&apos;grace before we must make a start in providing a replacement forAnderson.(v) If we disappoint them over Anderson the Ceylon Government mightdeliberately delay the purchase of some land which the R.A.F. urgentlyneed for extending two of their signal stations. The United kingdom high Commissioner believes that the risk is not very great; but it exists.(vi) I very much hope that we can lend Ceylon a frigate provided that they areprepared to pay for the refit (paragraph 7 (ii)). An offer to do so shouldhave a good effect and encourage the young and enthusiastic RoyalCeylon Navy who are ready to man it. It would be regarded by the ceylon Government as a solace for Anderson and should at leastremove the risk of obstruction over the lands required by the R.A.F.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,25th July, 1952.ANNEX I summary of Negotiations with Ceylon1. In 1947 a Defence Agreement (Command 7257) was signed between thetwo Governments which inter alia established the right of the United KingdomGovernment to base in Ceylon such naval, land and air forces &quot; as might be mutually agreed&quot; and under which Ceylon undertook to make the necessary facilities available.2. Subsequently the Ceylon Government told us that, while they had no desire to limit the facilities enjoyed by the United. Kingdom, they must insist as amark of their sovereign independence on acquiring ownership of all land, buildings and installations occupied by the United Kingdom Services in Ceylon. The UnitedKingdom Government accepted this in principle but pointed out that, as a corollary, it would be necessary to specify the terms of occupation to be enjoyed by the United Kingdom Services.3. Negotiations started in May 1949 with the following objects on the UnitedKingdom side:  [a) To meet the Ceylon Government^ wish to acquire ownership, involving the transfer of title to them and the purchase by the Ceylon Govern-ment of the title of third parties, i.e., land in private ownership.
( j (b) To provide for continued United Kingdom occupation without term andsubject to termination only as a result of consultation between theGovernments.(c) To establish the United Kingdom Governments right to the disposal valueof any fixed assets transferred to the Ceylon Government which maysubsequently become surplus to defence requirements.4. Owing to the devious tactics of the Ceylon Government no progress hasbeen made in these negotiations. A draft exchange of letters tabled by the UnitedKingdom remains before the Ceylon Government. The objections put forward bythe Ceylon Government have taken many forms. The broad background is thatthe Ceylon Government have declared themselves to be nervous of domesticcriticism that United Kingdom bases will attract attacks on Ceylon in any futurewar; they do not feel that Ceylon would be adequately defended unless substantialforces are retained in the island; and they appear to have felt that they should beable in one form or another, to extract from us a high price for security of tenurein the bases.5. The most recent negotiations are those which took place between the thenPrime Minister of Ceylon and United Kingdom Ministers in London in January1951. These negotiations did not advance matters. The Ceylon Prime Ministerat first took the line that it was politically impossible for him to reach an agreementgiving the United Kingdom services security of tenure in Ceylon unless (a) Ceylon personnel participated in the &quot; control &quot; of the bases;(b) the Ceylon defence forces were within the next two years built up to a high level sufficient in the eyes of the Ceylon Government to provide security against all foreseeable external aggression; this would involve the pro-vision free of charge by the United Kingdom of large quantities of equipment and the loan of substantial numbers of officers and men.6.   The United Kingdom reply was that (i) we could not accept Ceylon participation in the &quot; control&quot; of the installations;(ii) we could not lend officers and men, other than limited numbers to helpin training;(iii) we were not able to provide equipment for an inflated expansion pro-gramme and must maintain the principle that a commonwealth government must pay for its own defence;(iv) at the same time we were anxious to help Ceylon build up her defence forces and would co-operate by the supply of equipment and training facilities in implementing realistic expansion programmes (which were discussed) within the capabilities of Ceylon&apos;s man-power and finance;(v) in consideration of the Ceylon Government paying for the cost of acquir-ing the land on which our installations in Ceylon were sited (estimatedat  800,000) we would provide equipment free up to a total value ofthat figure.7. The outcome of these negotiations in January 1951 was that the ceylon government did not press their more extreme claims for participation in control,or for the provision free of charge of men and equipment on a great scale. More-over the Ceylon Prime Minister reaffirmed in so many words that the UnitedKingdom could count absolutely on the use in peace and war of the facilities and establishments which we now occupy. But they refused to accept, as a preliminary to negotiations about our security of tenure, anything less than an undertaking thatall capital equipment required by the Ceylon forces would be provided free of charge. There was no certainty that even if we gave such an undertaking we would secure a settlement about tenure.8. The situation was reviewed by the previous Government who decided not tomodify the stand taken by United Kingdom Ministers and to leave the negotia-tions in suspense in the belief that these tactics might help towards a more realisticattitude on the part of the Ceylon Government. The decision to reaffirm the offeralready made was conveyed to the Ceylon Government in a letter from Mr. Attleeto the then Ceylon Prime Minister dated 23rd April, 1951 (Annex II). No replywhatsoever has been received to that letter.
[D. 3220/70]ANNEX IICopy of a Letter from Prime Minister, London, to Prime Minister of Ceylon,dated 23rd April, 1951We were very glad to have the opportunity of discussing fully with you lastJanuary future defence arrangements generally in Ceylon, and in particular thequestion of providing security of tenure for the base facilities and establishmentswhich we occupy in Ceylon.It was clear from the discussions that there is no difference between us as tothe value and importance of these bases, not only to Ceylon and to the UnitedKingdom but also to the Commonwealth as a whole in view of the broad strategic considerations involved. We were glad to note your confirmation that the UnitedKingdom could count on the use of these bases in peace and war and that, as partof an overall settlement of the defence questions which have been under discussion between us, the Ceylon Government would be prepared to purchase the land required and to give us security of tenure. At the same time you explained that,before reaching such an overall settlement, the Ceylon Government would need to be assured of help in the building up of Ceylon&apos;s own defence forces.I should like to say at once that we are very anxious to give you such helpas may be open to us. We have, as you know, already made a quantity of equip-ment of various types available to you; we have also been glad to lend youinstructors, and to provide other training facilities for Ceylon personnel, and willcontinue to do so. The United Kingdom Ministers who took part in the dis-cussions with you in London made it clear that we regard the steady building upof Ceylon&apos;s defence forces as a valuable and important objective. It was for thisreason that we were glad to take the opportunity which was offered to us in thecourse of the discussions of making suggestions as to what would in our view be practical and realistic expansion programmes for the Ceylon forces, having regardto man-power and other considerations. These suggested programmes were attached to the document headed &quot; Proposed Heads of Agreement&quot; which was handed to you on 17th January, but I enclose copies for convenience of reference(Not copied; summary at Annex III.)In preparing these programmes we were able to indicate the various types and quantities of equipment which we would be ready to make available; we alsdindicated the additional personnel whom we would be prepared to loan to you for service in Ceylon and for short periods for training purposes.We felt that these offers, both of equipment and of personnel, represented avery substantial contribution on the part of the United Kingdom in their desireto help you in building up the Ceylon forces. You will know from the discussions at the meetings of Prime Ministers how urgent it is to strengthen our armed forcesin those areas where the threat of aggression is most pressing and it is only at thecost of requirements elsewhere that we can divert military resources (ships, aircraft,guns, ammunition, vehicles, radar and other technical equipment and supplies) to ceylon, which is an area less immediately liable to attack.You explained, however, that, while Ceylon would be prepared to pay forpersonnel, she was not prepared to meet the &quot; capital &quot; costs involved in theacquisition of the equipment required. As you know, we regard it as a matter ofprinciple that the independent countries of the Commonwealth should each shoulderthe burden of its own defence requirements and we could not contemplate a departure from this. Nevertheless, we were prepared, in consideration of thefact that the Ceylon Government was prepared to meet the cost of purchasing theland required for the bases, to provide equipment free up to a total of  800,000.The quantity of equipment which could thus be provided free was indicated in annex I to the document headed &quot; Proposed Formula of Agreement&quot; which was handed to Sir Oliver Goonetilleke on 19th January, a copy of which is enclosed.(Not copied.)At the final discussion with Sir Oliver Goonetilleke on 19th January he indi-cated that an offer to provide equipment free up to a total of  800,000 would notbe acceptable to the Ceylon Government and that the Ceylon Government would ask for the whole of the equipment to be provided free of charge. I have considered this with my colleagues and I am afraid that such a proposition could not beaccepted by us.  It is only because of the exceptional arrangements which exist
Tetween our two Governments in regard to the bases and because expenditure will fall on the Ceylon Government in respect of the land, that we have felt ableto depart from our normal policy in relation to Commonwealth Governments andto supplement our offer to make equipment available by an offer to provide  800,000worth of it free of charge. I can hold out no hope that we could increase this offer. For the reasons which I have given it seems to us that it is a generous oneboth in regard to the total quantity of equipment to be made available and theamount which would be supplied free.I very much hope therefore that you will feel able to accept this offer as abasis for further negotiations on the other outstanding points at issue. I amable to confirm that the United Kingdom Government would be ready to reach an overall settlement along the lines indicated in the document headed &quot; ProposedFormula of Agreement.&quot; I am arranging for our High Commissioner to be fully informed of the discussions in London and of our views, so that, if agreeable toyou, he will be able to resume discussions with the Ceylon Government.(Signed)        C. R. ATTLEE.The Right Hon. D. S. Senanayake.ANNEX IIIUnited Kingdom Proposals as to (i) the Scale of Equipment which we agreecould be Supplied to the Ceylon Forces, and (ii) the Rate at which itcan be Made Available (Communicated to the Ceylon Prime Minister on17th January, 1951).1.

3. Royal Ceylon Air force the Air Ministry endorse that part of the Ceylon Governments proposalswhich relates to the raising and training, during the period 1951-54, of two fighter squadrons to be manned by personnel of the Royal Ceylon Air Force, together witha suitable scale of technical and supply backing. The Air Ministry is preparedto make available the necessary training aircraft (both ab initio and advanced),and, when the appropriate stage of training has been reached, sufficient Spitfireaircraft for the two squadrons. Aircraft would be despatched in accordance witha phased training programme. The maximum number of aircraft that would beprovided under the above arrangements would be 7 Chipmunks (less those already available in Ceylon),7 Harvards,20 Spitfires.

CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CEYLONI. In a statement in Parliament on the 18th June, 1947, it was indicated that when Agreements on a number of subjects had been concluded on termssatisfactory to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the ceylon Government, steps would toe taken to amend the Constitution so asto confer upon Ceylon fully responsible status within the British Common-wealth of Nations.2. Agreements (of which the texts appear in Appendices I, II and iii of this paper) have now been concluded on the following matters of mutualconcern: (a) Defence;(6) External Affairs;&apos;(c) certain matters affecting Public Officers.3. The steps necessary to confer upon Ceylon the new status mentionedabove are: (a) the enactment of an Act of Parliament on the lines of the Bill the text of which has now been published; and(b) the amendment of the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council, 1946,so as to bring it into a form suitable for a fully self-governing member ofthe British Commonwealth.4. The principal alterations proposed in the Order in Council are asfollows: (a) in place of the Governor, there will be a Governor-General who, inthe exercise of his powers and functions, will, generally speaking, act inaccordance with the constitutional conventions applicable to the exerciseof similar powers and functions in the United Kingdom by His Majesty;(b) the powers reserved to His Majesty to make laws for Ceylon inmatters relating to Defence and External Affairs, and to amend and revoke the Order in Council, will be abolished;(c) the provisions for the reservation of bills for His Majesty&apos;s pleasurewill be revoked.APPENDIX I.UNITED KINGDOM-CEYiLONDefence AgreementWhereas Ceylon has reached the stage in constitutional development at which sheis ready to assume the status of a fully responsible imemiber oif the British Comimon-wealth of Nations, in no way subordinate in any aspect of domestic or external affairs, freely associated and united by comimon allegiance to the Crown;And whereas it is in the mutual interest of Ceylon and the United Kingdom ofGreat Britain and Northern Ireland that the necessary measures should, be taken for the effectual protection and defence of the territories of both and that the necessary facilities should be afforded for this purpose;Therefore the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of Ceylonhave agreed as follows: (1) The Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of Ceylonwill igive to each other such military assistance for the security of their territories,for defence against external aggression and for the protection of essential com-imunications as it may toe in their mutual interest to provide.
