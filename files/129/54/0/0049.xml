secret.(52) 299 COPY NO lQ15TH SEPTEMBER, 1952CABINETRENT RESTRICTION AND housing memorandum by the Minister of Housing andLocal government at Cabinet I was asked about rents, (C.C.(52) 78th Conclusions,Minute 9).    Here is a plan.    If we are to act at all, we must act quickly,2. &quot;Rent restriction&quot; and &quot;Housing&quot; are closely interlocked.    But&quot;rent restriction&quot; can only (politically) be dealt with in a climate of expandinghousing.3. Nearly 9 million houses (some two-thirds of the total number) areoccupied at artiflciallylow rents, at about 6/- to 8/- a we ek.      The economicrent of a typical new house today would be at least 30/- a week.    Makingthe fullest allowance for differences in standards, the continued existence ofthis large pool of houses at frozen rents is a deterrent to unsubsidised new building and to house owning in general.4. Some houses are falling out of use; many more houses are fallingout of repair, since it is not worth while to repair houses when no recoupmentcan be obtained from any increase in rents to offset the great increase in thecost of repairs.5. Many of the older houses are not worth repair; the proper fate forthem is demolition.    To this end we must as soon as possible resume ourpre-war campaign for slum clearance and provide for &quot;rehousing&quot; as a partof our housing programme.6. But there are much larger numbers of houses which, if properlymaintained, will continue to provide good homes for many years to come.The maintenance of these houses by the owners in a proper state of repairmust therefore be encouraged.7.        Increases in rents cannot be popular since there are more tenantsthan owners.    But it is only reasonable for owners to receive and fortenants to pay rents which take account of the current costs of maintaining their houses in a proper state of repair.x About 4 million which have been continuously under rent control since 1915are let at an average of 6/- per week: about 4^ million which came out ofcontrol between 1919 and 1939 and were recontrolled in 1939 are let at anaverage rent of 8/- a week.
8.        It is equitable therefore for rents to be fixed on this basis; but any increases should not be payable unless or until the houses are in fact in a proper state of repair.9, Rating revaluation (owing to a fatal flaw in the 1948 Act) cannot be operative till 1956 or so.   As a long term policy, rating valuation mightwell be taken as a basis for fair rents.Meanwhile, as a short term policy, present rating valuation couldserve as a measure for allowing some rent increases based on the allowance for repairs.10.       Under the existing law the figure on which rates are actually paid isarrived at by deducting from the gross value a figure based on the assumedcost of repairs.    New legislation might authorise an increase of rent up toan amount representing some increase on this figure.    For example on a house with a gross value, of  21 the deduction at present allowable for determing the net rateable value is  7; if the house is at present letat  21, the allowable increase of rent might be  7, on the basis that thecost of repairs has certainly not been less than double the pre-war amount.I give these figures merely by way of illustration,    I should like to reserve for further consideration the actual figure to be adopted.It would be a condition that no increases in rent would be payableuntil the house had been certified by the Local Authority as being in a propertenantable state of repair.It would be a necessary part of the scheme that the additional rentallowed (being wholly for repairs) should not attract -(a) any additional rating assessment and thereforeincreased rates, or(b) any additional Schedule A assessment and thereforeincreased tax.11,        Naturally, under such legislation, increased rents would be payableforthwith (as soon as the houses were certified by the local authorities)for those houses which, despite the difficulties since 1939, have in fact been adequately maintained by the owners.    My own expectation is that the numberof these houses would be much larger than would be suggested by commonreport.    Increased rents for other houses would no doubt be spread over anumber of years, as and when owners found themselves able and willing tocarry out repairs up to the standard necessary to obtain certificates.12,       If the Cabinet feel that it would be wise to deal with this problem in1952/53 session, a short Bill on these lines could be rapidly drafted.    I would leave over the many other complications of rent restriction till the 1953/54session.13,       Such a rent policy should be accompanied by a gradual reorientationof the new house building programme which aimed at an expansion of private building and a concentration of subsidised housing on slum clearance.Fair rents; more council houses than the Socialists built; moreprivate building; renewed slum clearance - they all hang together,H.M.Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment.15TH SEPTEMBER, 1952.
