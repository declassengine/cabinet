CglOTDENTIALC.(52) 260 COPY NO.    224TH JULY, 1952     .CABINETADMIRALTY AND WAR DEPARTMENT PROPERTY IN BERMUDA -Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty and theSecretary of State for WarFollowing the discussion on C. (52) 211 we were asked to put in a paper on the arrangements which would be made for the direct disposal of Serviceproperty by a Service Agency in Bermuda and the difficulties which might be encountered.2. Type of Agency.   The main choice lies between the following procedures:Agency   I A direct Service disposal agency run by the War Office orAdmiralty or both. PAgoncy II Employment of a first-class United Kingdom firm ofEstate Agents.   Their fees and expenses might come to 50,000.Agency III. Employment of a go-ahead Bermuda firm of EstateAgents.Agency IV A combination of II and III.   Fees and expenses might be 60,000.3. Methods.   Besides choice of agencies there is choice of methods ofdisposal: -Method   I The whole property, or large-scale portions of it, mightbe put up for disposal no,t merely in Bermuda but in othercountries with a view to clearing the lot in a short period(say 12 - 18 months).Method II Piece-meal sales might be carried out over a considerable period of time (3-5 years).   This method might includethe breaking up of land into small lots for local sale.Method III The whole property might be managed like any estateover an indefinite period with the object of opportunisticdisposal and lettings.$     The War Office property disposal agency has been instrumental in disposing of property abroad since the war for ,some  31,000,000.
All these methods could be applied by any of the agencies suggestedejggsept that wholesale disposal - MethodI - would not be carried out through a1^1 firm - Agencies III and IV.4. The liability for maintenance of the property does not affect the choice of agency, though it does affect that of methods. Also so far as it goes itfavours an overall settlement with. Bermuda, rather than direct disposal.  It isestimated that the total annual liability to manage and maintain War Office and admiralty surplus property so &quot;far. as is necessary from the sales aspect in itspresent condition would be some  40,000, but this would fall away as disposals,were effected,   In view of the probable disposal periods (paragraph 3) the totalmanagement and maintenance liability under Method I would be some  60*000,and under Method II some  120,000.The price the Bermudan Government was finally asked to pay took account fully of the management and maintenance liabilities remaining with the&apos;United Kingdom Government if the properties were sold piecemeal over a periodof years.5. The main difficulties about piecemeal disposal are:-(a) The degree of co-operation which could be expected from the BermudanGovernment in disposing of property might differ very considerably from their attitude if the property was their own.   In particular,they might prevent sales for development or to rion-Bermudanpurchasers: withhold consent to the starting of any new businessby a non-Bermudan; and apply exchange control regulations in sucha way as to discourage foreign (and especially dollar) investment.(b) The Dockyard would not prove an easy item for piecemeal disposal;and it would probably be necessary to reserve and maintain thebarrack property at Prospect against the eventual return of agarrison.   (Allowance was, however, made for both these factors in Her Majesty&apos;s Governments offer).6. Too much should not be made of these difficulties, however8 as:-(a) It might be awkward for Bermuda to offer open obstruction to the saleby Her Majesty&apos;s Government (either direct by the Service departments or by accredited agents) of its own property; and(b) Even if Bermuda were to attempt to make use of some of these difficulties, they could in practice probably be handled with a fairmeasure of success, and less embarrassment, by a first-classbusiness firm (i.e. Agencies II, III or IV).conclusion. We recommend that:(a) The Bermudan Government should be given an opportunity to reconsider its position (and at the same time to confirm its promise to co-operate);(b) If the Bermudan Government is not prepared to reconsider its previousoffer the property be disposed of piecemeal.  It is our view that thedifficulties (including those which may be raised by an unco-operativeBermudan Government) and the management and maintenance costsentailed by piecemeal disposal are not so great as to render this methodof disposal impracticable.. .&apos;       -        - &apos;   -2- -
(c) The precise method of piecemeal disposal would be settled later,but we. should like authority to employ private agencies if,m the Ught of circumstances, it seemed desirable.a0 hc24th july, 1952.
