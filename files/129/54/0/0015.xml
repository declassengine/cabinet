J M      ci cj Rt 01 iCONFIDENTIALCo (52) 265COPY NO.28th JULY, 1952,CABINETAWARD OF SCHOLARSHIPS AT BRITISH UNIVERSITIES TOCOMMEMORATE THE MARSHALL PLANMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in theCabinet conclusions of 22nd July (C.C,(52) 71st Conclusions,Minute 6) I was invited to consider the following points:-(a) Inclusion of women and married menDoubt was expressed whether, if Marshall Scholarships were open to women and married men, they would take the same full share in the corporatelife of British Universities as do Rhodes Scholars at Oxford.   This point was carefully considered in the consultations which took place with sir Hector Hetherington, the Chairman of the vice--Chancellors1 Committee,and Dr. Frank Aydelotte, theAmerican Secretary of the Rhodes Trustees.The conclusion was reached that the status of women and married men at universities had changed since Mr. Rhodes&apos; will was made and that it would now be difficult to justify their exclusion.   In the case of married men such adecision would raise additional difficulties, because the upper age limit forMarshall Scholars will be 30, instead of a limit of 25 which applies to RhodesScholars.   Moreover, Marshall Scholarships will be available not only atOxford and cambridge but at other Universities where the collegiate life doesnot have the same vitality.   It is relevant that these features of the schemehave been carefully considered and warmly commended not only by the vice--Chancellors&apos; Committee as a whole but individually by the vice--Chancellors of Oxford, Cambridge and London.(b) Value of the   ScholarshipsDoubt was expressed whether the basic value of a MarshallScholarship should be  100 a year more than that of a Rhodes Scholarship.This point was albo carefully considered during the preliminary consultationsmentioned above.   Sir Hector Hetherington advised that  500 was quite inadequate in present conditions.   Dr. Aydelotte took the view that the goodwill of ex-Rhodes Scholars in the United States might be forfeited to some extent,if the Marshall Scholarships were of greater value   than Rhodes Scholarshipsand the two schemes appeared to be competitive.   The Rhodes Trustees are understood to share this view, although the Warden of Rhodes House at Oxfordadmitted earlier that  500 a year is no longer adequate.   Sir Oliver Frankshas recommended the figure of  600 a year on the ground that much of the good effect of establishing these Scholarships would be destroyed if a start were madewith an insufficient stipend.   There is, in any case, good reason tobelieve that the marked differences between theRhodes and Marshall Scholarshipsespecially as regards the field to be covered will be sufficiently clear, once the new scheme is in operation, to prevent the one from affecting ordamaging the other.   But if these differences are diminished e.g, by excludingmarried students or women, then the difficulties with the Rhodes Trustacquire some reality.   One of the main points of the scheme put forward for the
soMarshall Scholarships is that it should not be a copy of the Rhodes scheme,!(* /)should break fresh ground.(c)   AdministrationIt was suggested that the estimated cost of administration in theUnited States was unduly high and that it might be possible to arrange for theRhodes Trustees to undertake the work of selection and administration,   Theobject of the very full consultation with Dr. Aydelotte, who was invited to cometo London for this purpose, was to discover how much help could be got fromthe Rhodes Trustees and, in particular, from their machinery for the selection of candidates in the United States.   Although much useful advice was given byDr. Aydelotte, the view of the Rhodes Trustees was that they could not be directly connected with the new scheme.   Apart from their fears of competition,they had to take into account the fact that the services of the ex-RhodesScholars serving on the district committees in the United States were entirelyvoluntary and unpaid. I have accordingly proposed that the main secretarialwork should be performed by H.M.Embassy and Consular Officers in theUnited States.   Dr. Aydelotte recommended that a nominal fee should be paidto those invited to serve on the four district committees for selection in theUnited States and this would slightly increase the cost of administration in theUnited States;  but this is not an essential element in the scheme.   The mainitem, hov/ever, is likely to be the travelling expenses of the committees&apos;members and the candidates to the four provincial centres and these would havebeen incurred even if the Rhodes machinery had been used.   There will alsobe some expenses in connection with the advisory committee which will assistHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington.   It is impossible to estimate theseexpenses with precise accuracy.   Sir Oliver Franks, after consultation withhis Administrative Officer and the Head of the British Information Services,has endorsed my estimate of $10,000 to Si5,000 a year,   I should hope that itcould, be keptat the lower figure, butS/ 10,000 is not a large sum to administerany scheme in a country the size of the United States of America.   Expensesof the same order would be incurred even if the Rhodes machinery of selectionin the United States could be used, and if my colleagues are not prepared to contemplate this, the scheme will have to be abandoned.2, On the foregoing grounds I recommend that my colleagues shouldapprove th- broad lines of the project as proposed in my previous paper.A.E.Foreign Office.
