Our discussion resulted in agreement that at least  4 millions should be saved from imports of coarse grains during the current half.year.This is an addition of  1 million to the  3 millions agreed by the Cabinet on15th July, 1952, and will entail a slight reduction of stocks at the end of theyear.   The Ministers of Food and Agriculture were of the opinion that a saving of more than  4 millions should not be attempted until we knew the outcome of the home harvest.   It was agreed that if the harvest proved to be a good one further restrictions on imports of coarse grains would be made with a view tosaving an additional  1 million before the end of the year.3.- The final outcome of our efforts to cluse the estimated non-sterlinggap of  175 millions during the second half of 1952, by increasing exports and reducing imports is as follows:-Increased Exports  millionDefence Equipment 10Coal 12Reduced ImportsOil 19Raw Materials 41Food 36Machinery and Manufactures 5Total 123Recommendations4.
