Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1952SECRETC. (52) 2748 th August, 1952CABINETEMERGENCY powers memorandum by the Home SecretaryMy colleagues will recall that,, immediately on assuming office, the Govern-ment was confronted with the necessity of renewing that body of emergency legislation which requires to be renewed by Parliament annually. In the debate in the House of Commons on 14th November, 1951, I justified its renewal for oneyear on the ground that it had been impossible for the Government in the time at its disposal to examine the situation in detail, and I promised that I wouldinitiate a review of the whole field of emergency legislation with a view to (a) abandoning emergency powers where possible;(b) embodying other powers in legislation requiring annual renewal;(c) replacing by permanent legislation powers which were permanentlyrequired;(d) identifying residual powers which it was appropriate and necessary tocontinue for the time being by Defence Regulations or other similarinstruments.2. As I informed the Cabinet on 15th May (C.C. (52) 53rd Conclusions,Minute 10), this review was undertaken by a Sub-Committee of the Home AffairsCommittee under my chairmanship, and the present memorandum is submitted inpursuance of my promise to report on the matter to the Cabinet as soon as possible.It will be convenient if I deal with the matter under each of the heads (a) to id)above.Abandonment of Powers3. A few emergency powers have become otiose since 10th December last,the date when the renewal of the general body of emergency powers for one yeartook effect. Examples are the National Registration Act, 1939, and the two cognateDefence Regulations. The recent enactment of the Parliamentary Under-Secretaries Act and the Miners&apos; Welfare Act has made possible the abandonment of other emergency powers. There are a further ten individual regulations or codesof regulations to whose abandonment Departments have already agreed. So faras four of these cases are concerned, however, abandonment before 10th Decemberdepends on the passing by that date of the Visiting Forces Bill, the Currency andBank-Notes Bill and the Marine and Aviation Insurance (War Risks) Bill, whichare at present before Parliament.4. The whole body of powers has been reviewed in detail with a view toidentifying further powers which might, on a fresh review by the Ministers con-cerned, be found to be no longer essential. Some eleven powers or groups ofpowers have been so identified and I have recently written to those of my colleaguesconcerned explaining that, if it again falls to me later in the year to defend thecontinuance of the powers in question, I shall find if exceedingly difficult to offer42729Copy No.
any satisfactory explanation as to why they are needed and urging them to agree^to their abandonment.   The Home Affairs Committee has endorsed my appealto my colleagues for the abandonment of the powers in question.Embodiment of Powers in Legislation Requiring Annual Renewal5.- The powers involved here are the means of enforcing the main economic,controls including food and fuel rationing, the control of raw materials and building operations, the price control system, and a number of functions in respectof home food production. The Sub-Committee felt that what would be required would be a series of Bills, each dealing with a particular group of these powers-for example, price control powers, powers in respect of land, rationing powers andso on. Whilst the necessary preliminary studies by officials have been set in training certain selected fields, it is necessary to recognise that, even when it has proved possible to embody each complex group of powers in a Bill, which will inevitably be a lengthy process, the prospect of fitting such Bills into the legislative programme in the foreseeable future would be remote in the extreme. Thus, it appears likely tobe necessary to omit from the programme for the 1952-53 Session (which will inany case be overloaded) no less than forty Bills, the case for the majority of whichcan almost certainly be based on stronger grounds than the need to regularisepowers deriving from emergency legislation. A fortiori any suggestion that suchActs should be renewable annually would be most unpalatable from the point ofview of the legislative programme for future sessions. Quite apart from these considerations, moreover, any attempt to make certain of these powers permanentwould be bound to arouse opposition which may well remain largely latent so longas the powers are regarded as a temporary survival from wartime. For example,it. is not difficult to imagine the controversy that would be aroused by a Billconferring on the Government powers to requisition land.6. The conclusion to be drawn appears to be inescapable, namely, that, evenon the most favourable hypotheses, there is no real prospect of dispensing in thenear future with the main bulk of these powers.Embodiment in Permanent Legislation of Powers Permanently Required7. The whole field of emergency powers has also been reviewed from thepoint of view of identifying those powers which are required permanently and oughttherefore to be embodied in permanent legislation. As a result the heads of anEmergency Laws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, covering some dozen subjects and therefore a corresponding number of regulations or codes of regulations, havebeen drawn up and the Home Affairs Committee has approved in principle thepreparation of the necessary Bill. There appears to be no prospect of such a bill being enacted by 10th December next and thereby obviating the need to renew the powers in question for a further period. It is very desirable, however, that theBill should at least have been introduced before Parliament is asked to approve the renewal of emergency powers generally.Residual Powers8. There will inevitably be a number of residual powers which it is bothappropriate and necessary to continue for the time being by Defence regulations or other similar instruments. Where such powers are required in connection with,for example, the Korean war, their retention on the basis of emergency enactmentsseems in no way inappropriate.conclusions . I shall not attempt to disguise from my colleagues the fact that the positionrevealed by the review of emergency legislation is likely to prove an embarrassing one for the Government. The truth is that the Parliamentary situa-tion only permits a modest beginning to be made with the course of action in thismatter foreshadowed in &quot; Britain Strong and Free&quot;:-&quot; No Government should have powers greater than those required for theimmediate business in hand. The war-time emergency legislation must bethoroughly overhauled. Such powers, but no more, as are required for thepresent critical situation should be incorporated in new Statutes requiring
Home Office, S.W.1,8th August, 1952.annual renewal. New Orders will have to be made under these new Acts,and thus all the Regulations and Orders under emergency powers will have tobe reviewed by Parliament.&quot;This conclusion holds good not only in relation to the emergency powers requiringto be renewed annually, but also as regards those Acts of Parliament which continue in force until Orders in Council declare the &quot; emergency that was the occasion ofthe passing of this Act&quot; to be at an end. I can, however, assure my colleagues that I shall make every effort, in co-operation with those of my colleagues con-cerned, to make the maximum possible further progress in the matter before thetime comes to invite Parliament to agree to a further renewal of the powers inquestion.10. I invite my colleagues to take note of the position described in thismemorandum.D. M. F.
