Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1952.CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (52) 2913rd September, 1952CABINETDISARMAMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in my memorandum C. (52) 258 of 23rd July I requested the approval of theCabinet for a draft working paper, to be submitted by the United Kingdom Dele-gate in the Disarmament Commission of the United Nations. In view of the pressure of Cabinet business, however, I thereafter suggested to the Prime minister that it might be sufficient if he and the Minister of Defence only joined me in approving the action proposed.2. Having received their approval, I instructed the United Kingdom delegate to consult with his United States and French colleagues to seek their co-sponsorshipof the paper before tabling. It then emerged that the United States and french governments had certain reservations, not only regarding comparatively minordrafting points but also as to the wisdom of tabling this paper at the stage in thediscussions that the Commission had by then reached. This reaction is disappoint-ing, and not perhaps altogether reasonable, but it seemed unwise to insist on havingour paper tabled, if this were going only to give the appearance of a divisionamong the Western Powers on the Commission. The time available before theCommission was to start drafting its report was too short to enable us to persuade the United States and French Governments to reconsider their objections, but itwas felt that we might be able, provided action was taken before the drafting ofthe Commission^ report had proceeded too far, to achieve the essential object ofthe United Kingdom paper by guiding the way in which this report of the Commis-sion is drafted. It will be recalled that the essential object of the United Kingdomdraft paper was to prepare the ground for debate in the coming United nations general Assembly by demonstrating that the Western Powers are not evadingcertain aspects of disarmament and that the Soviet Union have made no construc-tive proposals towards it.3. The United Kingdom Delegate has accordingly been instructed not topress further for the tabling of the United Kingdom draft paper, but instead, ifpossible, to ensure that the report contains a list of the subjects for study bythe Commission, as in paragraph 1 of the United Kingdom draft paper; recordsthe tabling by the Western Powers of their various statements; and in one way or another calls for endorsement of the Western thesis that the aspects of disarma-ment must be taken seriatim, in due order, and all of them subject to approval by governments at an ultimate Conference of States. If these essential features canbe incorporated in the Disarmament Commission^ report, the primarily tacticalpurpose of the United Kingdom draft paper should be achieved.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,3rd September, 1952.42861
