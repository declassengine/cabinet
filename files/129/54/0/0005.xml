CABINET office record COPY(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL ,0.(52) 255 COPY NO..-.22ND JULY. 1952CABINET   &apos;TERRITORIAL WATERSJoint Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State-  &apos; - for the Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power,the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Ministerof transport the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs invites theCabinet to decide now to change the way in which theterritorial waters round the United Kingdom are delimited.He recommends application to our coasts of the principlesenunciated by the International Court in the case, of Norway.2.     We strongly oppose this recommendation.3.     Application of the Norwegian principles necessarilymeans reduction in the area of the high seas.   Internalwaters would thereby be greatly extended and the belt of territorial waters pushed out seawards.   The adoption ofthese principles   throughout the world would be a mostunwelcome development.2;.     Our interests as a great naval and maritime powerdemand the greatest possible freedom of movement for shipping in peace and the widest freedom for the exerciseof belligerent rights in war.    The following are theprincipal disadvantages which would follow from the generaladoption of extensive internal and territorial waters:-(a) The Royal Navy would be hampered in war, because it is not normally entitled to take offensiveaotion or to exercise belligerent rights in neutral territorial waters.   Extension ofthese waters would make it harder to keeppotentially hostile coasts under observation.Conversely, the advantage to an enemy on the- defensive would be correspondingly increased since neutrals cannot control their internal and territorial waters effectively if thesebecame very large.(b) Over internal waters the jurisdiction of the coastal state, even in peace, is complete and foreign shipping can only use them onsufferance.
(c)   Extension of internal and territorial watersmay interfere with the use of straits (e.g.  .Egyptian interference with the EMPIRE ROACHhound for Aqafca) and channels close to the shore (e.g. Londonderry), and waters inarchipelagos (e.g.. Indonesia, Greece). Thearea of sea under foreign jurisdiction inwhich our merchant ships may he hoarded anddelayed and searched without justificationwill &quot;be enlarged.   The risks.of ahuse &quot;by foreign States have increased in recent years.(d.) The further territorial waters lie off thecoast and the more they are measured fromartificial &quot;baselines, the more difficultit is for the navigator to know whether,or not, he is inside foreign waters.and,consequently, the greater is the danger ofawkward incidents involving British ships.(e) The assumption of sovereignty over the seacarries with it equal sovereignty over theair above that sea.(f) Our deep sea fishing fleets take 90 per cent of the British catch.   Any general scrambleto increase the area of exclusive jurisdiction over the high seas would probaoly lead to the exclusion of our deep sea trawlers from someof their present fishing grounds.5s.    No country is ohliged to apply the Norwegian principles,and ideally the &quot;broader interests of the United kingdom would best he served if there were no general adoptionof these principles.   Even assuming this is too much to hope, the next &quot;best outcome of the judgment would &quot;be avery moderate application of its principles which aresubjective and open to wide differences of interpretation.6.     The main purpose of the proposal to adopt the &quot;base-  .line method for United Kingdom waters is to enable the moray Firth to &quot;be closed against foreign trawlers.   Butfor the pressure from Scottish inshore fishermen, therewould he no reason for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to change their practice at the present time.   Now the Moray Firthis 78.miles wide, and for the United Kingdom to adopt a base-line of this length would surely kill any hope of influencinginternational opinion towards moderate applications of theNorwegian principles.   On the contrary, by drawing a base-line 78 miles long, the United Kingdom would he giving a highly immoderate lead to the rest of the world.   This stepcould not. fail to he interpreted as a significant departure from Her Majesty&apos;s Governments traditional maintenance ofthe freedom of the seas and from their determination tccontest unjustifiable claims to jurisdiction over british shipping.7.     On the other hand, Her Majesty&apos;s Government need not he hy any means alone in attempting to restrict to theminimum the effect of the Hague Court judgment on existingpractices.   Belgium, Holland, Denmark and even Prance and sweden are all interested to a greater or lesser extent in limiting inroads into the high seas.   Above all,-there,is evidence that the United States&apos; administration takesa similar view to ours on this question.   There is also some reason to hope that the International Law Commission. -2-
nitself may eventually favour moderation.   The preliminaryreport by its rapporteur asks the. Commission to considera rule limiting base-lines across bays to a maximum lengthof 10 miles.   This would be in accordance with our present,practice and is a suggestion that we would certainly favour.A declaration by several leading maritime powers on theimportance of restricting national jurisdiction over the seawould.constitute weighty evidence which the&quot;Commission wouldbe bound to take into account in drawing up its report.8.     We urge that the attitude of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentoh this subject should reflect the confidence of a worldpower whose policy looks to:far horizons,   We suggest itwould be difficult to defend legislation which subordinatedour wide naval, maritime, aviation and fisheries affairs    .to the narrower interests of a section of Scottish opinion,however much we may sympathise with the motives inspiringthat opinion.   In any event it would be premature to legislate to change bur long-established policy before wehave seen what support we can rally.   We propose that atpresent the United Kingdom should reserve its own positionin order to strengthen Its influence ih attempting to secureinternationally the narrowest possible interpretation of thenew Hague Court principles and the shortest possible base-lines.9.     We accordingly recommend -(i)   that the Cabinet should decide not to accept inprinciple the use of base-lines by the UnitedKingdom, at least until everything possible,including suitable approaches to governments with similar views, has been done to influence .International opinion towards moderation;(ii)   that Professor Lauterpacht, the British member ofthe International Law Commission, should be given further guidance to the effect that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would wish to see the shortest possible base-lines adopted;(iii)   that the Departments, principally concerned should consider the best means of pursuing the objectdescribed in the second part of recommendation (i) above.L.J.P.L.T.A.L-B.22nd July, 1952
