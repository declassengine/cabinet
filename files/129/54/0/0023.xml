INCREASE OF ENGINEERING EXPORTS:  DEFERMENTOF APPRENTICESMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service the Minister of 5upply&apos;s paper (C.(52) 270) advocating the deferment ofcall-up of engineering apprentices in order to assist exports over-simplifies theproblems involved.2. The principle of deferment of engineering ex-apprentices for two yearsafter completing their apprenticeship has been agreed in connection with certainsuper-priority defence work.   If certain export work is regarded as being as important as this super-priority defence work - and in view of our adverse balanceof trade I would not dissent from this view - I think that the same principle should apply.   If this is accepted, the only issue is the conditions and limitationsto be imposed, and it is on this that I do not agree with the Minister of Supply&apos;sproposals.3. The scheme for deferring engineering ex-apprentices on super-priority defence work was drawn up, and agreed by the Cabinet, after the most careful consideration.   It was considered to be essential to prevent too great a breach being made in the principle of universality of service, otherwise thesystem of call-up would be brought into disrepute and its continuance imperilled.For a similar reason it was regarded as essential to limit the period of deferment to two years and avoid giving the impression that call-up could beescaped entirely by administrative action.   Also, the requirements of the services for skilled tradesmen were safeguarded by allowing them to have the tradesmen theyneeded and whose skill they would fully use.4. I suggest that it is impossible to have one scheme for defence work and adifferent scheme with different conditions for export work.5, Accordingly, I suggest the object of the Minister of Supply will be met by extending the present scheme for defence work to certain export work.For this purpose I suggest that a strictly limited list of categories of engineeringwork which contribute most to exports should be given super-priority in the same way as super-priority is given to certain defence work.   These categories could include sections of the engineering industry such as gauges, tools and machine-tools, which contribute indirectly to exports as well as those like, for example,heavy electrical plant, which make a direct contribution.6. A scheme on these lines can be put into operation at once and can be defended without difficulty as an extension of the scheme that is at presentoperating successfully.W.M.Ministry of Labour and NationalService, S.
