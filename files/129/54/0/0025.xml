(THIS document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y*S GOVERN MENT)&quot;^1CONFIDENTIALC,(52) 275COPY NO5TH AUGUST4952CABINETPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN PERSIANote by the Secretary of State for,Foreign affairs circulate below, for the information of my colleagues, the text ofa letter from Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Tehran to Sir JamesBowker at the Foreign Office, about recent political developments inH.M. CHARGE DfAFFAIRES ^ TEHRAN, TO THE FOREIGNOFFICE:  28TH JULY,1952This is a last rriiriute letter to catch the bag to fill in some of thedetails which I may have missed in my recent telegrams.    I am afraid eventsh^ve moved so fast that it has been virtually impossible to give you everydetail of the picture which in any case has been changing from day to day and almost from hour to hour.2.      As you will have seen from today&apos;s telegrams Musaddiq has nowwithdrawn his offer of mediation, for whatever it may have been worth, andis showing signs of adopting a more intransigeant attitude than ever.    TheAmerican Ambassador and I, after our most recent interviews with Musaddiq,both came away with the impression that his megalomania is now verging onmental instability.    He sees himself as the chosen saviour of his people andis extremely sensitive to the slightest criticism.    He was never veryamenable to reason but lately he has had to be humoured like a fractiouschild.    This is difficult when he throws the blame for anything that happensor may happen on to the Americans and ourselves.    Finally, he issurrounded by a gang as little amenable to reason as himself and,there doesnot appear to be a single person in his entourage with whom one can discuss matters in a rational way.3,       I hear that disorders in the provincial centres last week were more severe than we had suspected.    Isphahan, according to some reports, was virtually in the hands of the communists for a time and anything up to 200people may have been killed.    There are also unconfirmed reports qfPersia.A , E.Foreign Office, S,W.l.5th AUGUST,1952
attacks on American Point Four people.    Similarly in Ahwaz riotingseems to have been on a large scale and there was serious trouble inKermanshah,    I hope to have a clearer picture by next week though itwill not add much to what we already know of the undoubted strength ofthe Tudeh and its affiliated communist organisations.4.      Meanwhile the process of eliminating any opposition to theNational Front, at least from the Right Wing, is going rapidly ahead.I hear that the Imam Jumeh, the recently elected President of theMajlis, is likely to resign or go on an extended holiday abroad very shortly.    Dr. Human, the Vice Minister of Court, is also said to havebeen forced to resign because   of bis known opposition to Musaddiq,As regards the Court itself Princess Ashraf is believed to be leaving the country again and Prince Abdul Reza whom I say a few days ago,tells me that he is sending his wife and child abroad and may followthem himself if attacks on the Royal Family continue.    Prince Ali Rezais perhaps in the most serious trouble of all.    *He is alleged to haveemptied his revolver into the crowd during the events of the 21st July andthere is some demand for a special enquiry into his conduct on that occasion.    If this threat is carried out his life may well be in danger.The Shah himself is believed to have planned to send Queen Soraya toSwitzerland or Germany but to have been dissuaded for the moment.Qavam is still in hiding somewhere near Tehran but I fear the mob isafter his blood and it is going to be difficult for him to smuggle himselfout of Pe rsia,5.      The Opposition press has almost ceased to exist.    Dad survivesbut Tulu, Nabard and Atish have disappeared.    Even Ittela&apos;at has onlycome out twice during the last week.6.      I have reported the strength of the communists and the part theyplayed during the recent crisis.    I can only add that during my acrimoniousmeeting with Musaddiq this morning I got the clear impression that,whatever his fears of communism, he is unlikely to take firm actionagainst them at this juncture and if he ever makes up his mind to try tocontrol them, it will probably be too late.    When I asked him point blankwhat he was doing about the communists he replied that the Tudeh party were proscribed but that the law did not say anything about e. g. Partisansof Peace and he could not therefore legally take action against the latteror similar crypto-communist organisations.    I think that,his principlemotivation just now is spite against the Americans and ourselves and hewill stop at nothing to vent his dislike even though in effect it meansalliance with the communists.7.      As. I said above Musaddiq appears to be beyond reasonable thought and to be swayed entirely by emotion.    The other dominant element in theNational Front is now Kashani, a sly, corrupt and anti-Western demagogue.In the circumstances it is perhaps not surprising that Henderson and I havebeen forced to the conclusion that it is -useless counting on the National Frontas a barrier against communism.8.      As I have also reported by telegram, it now looks as though the only thing to stop Persia falling into communist hands is a coup d&apos;etat,    I do notthink that such a step would be faintly practicable   for at least two or threeweeks when the present mob passions may have somewhat died down andMusaddiq can be counted upon once more to have demonstrated his lackof a positive policy.    There is no outstanding can didate though GeneralZahidi has apparently entered himself in the lists and might well be adequate.
SIFor the moment I think we can only &quot;wait and see&quot;; no one has asked us for help, financial or otherwise, and it would be unwise to offer itgratuitously.    It is just possible that the Shah might be persuaded atthe last moment to endorse someone like Zahidi; it would depend upon which of his many fears is uppermost at the time.    If he is seriously frightened of communism and anxious to keep his job he might be panicked into doing the right thing.9.       When I was in London I said that it was difficult to beoptimistic about Persia.    I am sorry that events have justified thatgloomy prognostication.-3-
