(THlM)OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S government secret.(52) 297 COPY NO._^10TH SEPTEMBER, 1952CABINETEAST-WEST TRADE - PRIOR COMMITMENTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the President of the Board of trade at their meeting on 3lst July, (C. C. (52) 75th Conclusions,Minute 5), the Cabinet considered our memorandum C. (52) 266 onthe extent to which contractual obligations undertaken by UnitedKingdom firms before the introduction of export controls to supply to Soviet bloc countries goods now subject to embargo and certainmachine tools not on the embargo list should be met;  before reaching a decision the Cabinet invited us, in consultation with theColonial Secretary and Minister of Supply, to make a detailedscrutiny of the list of commitments to supply such items and to identify those on the embargo list to the Soviet bloc, those whichwere of overriding strategic importance, and those whose export hadbeen prevented following the House of Commons debate onJ8th September, 1950.2. This has now been done.    First, as mentionediinparagraph 2 of C. (52) 266, no less than j&amp;6 million worth of priorcommitments have been cancelled because they were of over-ridingstrategic importance; this includes 67 machine tools valued at 860,000, listed at Annex A.    Secondly, the number of outstandingcommitments has been significantly altered since the Cabinet meetingby the decision of Craven Brothers to refund the advance payments which had been made against their Polish machine tool contracts;the firm now regard both their Polish and Russian contracts for machine tools as &quot;in abeyance&quot;.    This removes the immediatedifficulty but does not finally dispose of the problem.3. The list of outstanding commitments  can conveniently be divided into three categories as follows:-(a)  Exports of embargo list items to the valueof about  &quot;! million to which we are already committed (e,g. by the grant of export licences) and which we have already notified to the Paris Group and the United StatesGovernment.    None of them is regardedas of overriding strategic importance, and none is of any of the types mentioned in the debate of 18th September, 1950.
(b) Known orders for embargo list items whichhad been accepted by firms before thecontrol was imposed but on which no finaldecision has yet been taken.    These number15 items (covering 19 machine tools) of atotal value of about  90,000.    None of them is regarded as of overriding strategic importance and none is of any of the types mentioned in the debate of 18th September, 1950.(c) Orders for machine tools not on the  embargo listwhich have been accepted by firms but whichare still outstanding.    Their total value isabout  980,000.    As they are not on the embargolist the exports would not normally be prevented,but 19 machines, (listed at Annex B) valued at 364,000, are of types specifically mentionedin the House of Commons debate, though 15 ofthem valued at  331,000 are on the books ofCraven Brothers and (as stated in paragraph above) are not now intended for export.The above estimates are believed complete for machine tools, whichwere made the object of a special investigation, but in other classesof goods further prior commitments not yet honoured may come to light in small numbers.4. If, as we assume from the previous discussion, our colleagues are concerned principally about goods referred to in theHouse of Commons debate, detailed consideration need only be givento the 4 machine tools under (c) valued at  33,000, and to theprinciple of exporting other non-embargo list machine tools of the types mentioned in the debate in future.   Here it is worth examining thereasons for action taken by the late Government following the debate;  also the long term effects of giving special treatment tothese particular orders.5. Following the debate and in conformity with an agreementwith the United. States and French Governments reached at about thesame time in Washington, all prior commitments were scrutinisedto stop the export of any of overriding strategic importance and anywhich might be required for United Kingdom, Commonwealth orN.A.T.O. Defence Programmes.    Particular attention was paid tomachine tools, because of our own rearmament requirements and,to permit the screening of pending orders, a virtual standstill wastemporarily imposed on exports to the Soviet bloc, regardless of whether or not the tools were normally subject to embargo.    Itwas as a result of this review that the 67 machine tools mentionedin paragraph 2 and listed at Annex A were stopped on grounds ofoverriding strategic importance.    All the known remaining prior
commitments, apart from the^6 million worth already cancelled(see paragraph 2 of C.(52) 266), are listed for information at annex C.    It was contemplated that prior commitments to supplyembargoed items which proved not to be required for defence wouldbe honoured, provided the particular tools were not regarded (i. e. byIntelligence and technical experts) as of overriding strategic importance;and also that exports of non-embargo items for which no defence need was found to exist would be permitted.    This policy has in fact beenpursued.6. To stop export of the 4 Davy and United machine tools listedat Annex B (which have already been licensed) would be inconsistent with our normal policy of honouring contractual obligations.    to stop the export of any machine tools of the types listed at Annex Bwould be inconsistent with the Paris Group policy of permittingexports of items outside the embargo list.    None of these tools is onthe embargo list, and to stop them would be tantamount to extending the embargo list permanently, since it would then be illogical topermit acceptance of any new orders for the same items.    The embargolist was fixed after exhaustive discussion with the other western powers when it was agreed that these types of machine tools should beincluded among the goods which might be supplied in limited quantities to the Soviet bloc.    It is unlikely that they would now agree to their inclusion on the embargo list.    While it would be possible for theUnited Kingdom to embargo the items unilaterally, the security gainwould be negligible, since other countries would be free to meet theSoviet bloc requirements.    The agreed Paris embargo list is the foundation of the security export control system enforced against theSoviet bloc.    It is only by adhering to this list, and to the Paris Grouppolicy of honouring prior commitments, save where the strategic importance of the item is so great as to outweigh all other considera-tions, that we have any firm basis on which to stand in dealing with theUnited States Government.7. In formulating, as requested by the Cabinet, details of out&quot;standing contractual obligations to supply certain goods to the soviet bloc, we have thought that our colleagues would wish to know not onlythe precise extent of orders for machine tools specially mentioned inthe House of Commons debate of 18th September, 1950, but also the implications for the security export control policy as a whole, ofsingling out these items for special treatment.8. Our own view, formed after weighing all the arguments, isthat it would be wise for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to take their standon the principle that we should be prepared to grant export licences for:-(a) prior commitments where the goods concerned are on the embargo list but not of overriding strategic importance;  and(b) machine tools not on the embargo list.In considering the issue of such licences, we should continue to giveprecedence to the claims of our own, Commonwealth and Allied defence programmes.    The export of the 4 Davy and United tools mentioned in annex B which fall under (b) above, would be in accordance with thispolicy and would in our view be justified.A.E.P.T.10TH. SEPTEMBER, 1952.
