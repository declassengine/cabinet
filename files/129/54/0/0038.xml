ftPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   7C. (52) 28827th August, 1952CABINET :JAPANESE- ASSETS IN- THE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Minister of PensionsAt their meeting on 7th August, 1952, the Cabinet invited me to submit fortheir consideration a practical plan for distributing Japanese assets in the UnitedKingdom on a per capita basis among persons who had been prisoners of war or civilian internees in Japanese hands (C.C. (52) 76th Conclusions, paragraph 3).Plan2.   I submit the following plan for the Cabinefs consideration:  (1) Identification of Potential BeneficiariesThe persons eligible to benefit fall into a number of categories ex-prisoners of war of the Navy, Army and Air Force, and merchant navy, and ex-civilian internees. In addition there are the dependants ofthose who died in captivity. It is understood that the numbers involved are approximately 38,000 Service personnel, 4,000-5,000 civilian interneesand 10,000 dependants. The amount available for distribution is likelyto be about  900,000.The records of all these people are unfortunately not concentrated inone Department five or more Departments are involved. Apart fromthis, in view of the passage of time many of the records would not beup to date owing to changes of address. Moreover, some of theex-prisoners will have died and there might be no record of this.There is, however, a fairly complete list of potential beneficiariesextant, for the Far Eastern Prisoners of War (F.E.P.O.W.) Associationclaim that 95 per cent, of the ex-prisoners of war are members of theirAssociation. As the Association keeps in close touch with their membersthis list is likely to be up to date.(2) ApplicationFor a number of reasons it is desirable to require the individualcompletion of a simple application form. Invitations to apply for a formcould, of course, be issued through the press, but the result would undoubtedly be that many applications would be sent to the wrongDepartment. A more satisfactory method would be to ask F.E.P.O.W.to issue a form to each of their members. F.E.P.O.W. would be responsiblefor collecting the forms and for sending them to the appropriate Depart-ment. Those from Navy personnel would go to the Admiralty, from army personnel to the War Office, and from Air Force personnel to the AirMinistry. Forms from Merchant Navy personnel could be sent eitherto the Minister of Transport or to the Ministry of Pensions as both these departments hold lists of Merchant Seamen who were detained in theFar East. There is a difficulty about civilians. The Foreign Office willprobably have certain records and the Ministry of Pensions will haverecords of ex-internees so far as they are pensioners; and the Board of42821
Trade might be able to help. It is, however, preferable for the applica^tions to be dealt with by one Department, and I suggest that either theMinistry of Pensions or the Foreign Office might be nominated for thispurpose.(3) Certification of Eligibility for PaymentEach Department would be responsible for checking the applicationswith their records, or in the case of civilians with such records as areavailable in various Departments or with voluntary organisations. Theywould also certify eligibility to participate.(4) PaymentWhen the amount of the per capita payment has been fixed, whichcould only be after the approximate number of admissible claims isknown, each Department would make their own payments. Thus Navypersonnel would be paid by the Admiralty, Army personnel by the WarOffice and Air Force personnel by the Air Ministry. Merchant seamen and civilians would be paid by the Departments selected to deal withtheir applications (see 2 (2) above).(5) publicity in giving publicity to the scheme it could be said that communica-tions would be sent to those who are known to have potential claims andthat any persons who think they have a right to participate and havenot received a letter by a given date should write to F.E.P.O.W. Thisshould pick up the 5 per cent, not on F.E.P.O.W.&apos;s register and should act as a reminder to those who have not returned their forms. A closingdate should also be notified.3. I suggest that this plan, if approved in principle by the Cabinet, shouldbe examined by a Working Party of officials presided over by a nominee of theSecretary of State for War, since his Department will receive the bulk of the applications. The Committee should consist of representatives of the Treasury,the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence, the three Service Departments, theBoard of Trade, the Colonial Office, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry ofPensions and the F.E.P.O.W. Association.4. It is clearly desirable that one Minister, possibly either the Secretary ofState for War or myself, should be responsible for administering the scheme.5. If the plan is approved by the Cabinet, perhaps they would give decisions as to whether (1) applications from Merchant Seamen should be dealt with by the Ministryof Pensions or by the Ministry of Transport;(2) applications from civilian internees should be dealt with by the Ministryof Pensions or by the Foreign Office;(3) the responsible Minister should be the Secretary of State for War ormyself.D. H.-A.Ministry of Pensions, S.W. I,27th August, 1952.
