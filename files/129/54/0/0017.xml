C)Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1952SECRET Copy No.     7C. (52) 26728th July, 1952CABINETSUEZ CANALMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe basic assumption of this paper, which I am circulating for the considera-tion of my colleagues, is that steps must be taken to safeguard the free transit ofthe Suez Canal irrespective of whether or not current bilateral discussions with egypt make headway and irrespective of the decision taken in regard to a middle east Defence Organisation. The measures suggested here will have to be related to both these projects, and it is desirable to leave some flexibility in the timing.Present Position2. An ill-disposed Egyptian Government might at any time try to restrictor stop traffic going through the Suez Canal. It could do this either by directobstruction or by applying pressure to the Suez Canal Company. The Suez canal company could also be rendered so inefficient through pressure upon its techniciansas to restrict the Canal&apos;s operation.3. Recent evidence that Egypt might abuse her geographical position in thisway is as follows:  (a) In 1948, in connexion with the Palestine conflict, the Egyptian Governmentimposed contraband control on cargoes passing through the Canal forIsrael, thereby casing heavy losses to British Insurance interests and shipping. They invoked Articles 9 and 10 of the Suez Canal convention of 1888 which gave Egypt the right to take the necessary measures for ensuring the execution of the Convention and the defence of Egypt,including the maintenance of public order by their own forces. TheEgyptian Government defied the Resolution of the Security Councilof 1st September, 1951, calling upon them to remove these restrictions.(b) In January of this year the then Egyptian Prime Minister, Nahas Pasha,threatened the Suez Canal Company. The Company fear that although their concession does not expire until 1968, the fact that the company is foreign owned and makes large profits for Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand other foreign shareholders makes it an attractive target fornationalist Egyptian politicians in much the same way as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was to nationalist Iranian politicians up to 1951.(c) In June of this year the Egyptian authorities requested the Suez canal company to pay in Egyptian pounds the dividend payments due toHer Majesty&apos;s Government in sterling on 1st July. This request for-unfortunately came too late to hold up this payment in sterling. In July the egyptians further requested the Company to place at the disposal ofthe Bank of Egypt the Company&apos;s sterling earnings until the end of thisyear. The Company, whose position is weakened by the fact that theyare an Egyptian company, felt obliged to fob the Egyptians off with an offer to transfer  3 million from the sterling currently at their disposal.In return the Company have obtained only oral assurances againstrenewed demands and there is a danger that their weakness on this occasion, coupled with Egyptian sterling shortage, may encouragefurther Egyptian demands on the Company&apos;s sterling.42653 b
4. The purported Egyptian abrogation- in October 1951 of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty (together with the Immunities Convention concerning the immunities-ties and privileges to be enjoyed by the British forces in Egypt) has led to Egyptianinterference with the free working of the Canal: -(a) The Wafd Government did not actually prevent shipping passing throughthe Canal but some disorganisation was caused by the withdrawal ofstevedores and other Egyptian labour and by the imposition ofunreasonable customs and other formalities. In order to keep shipsmoving the Royal Navy had to step in and assist in such tasks asberthing, loading and unloading and marshalling of convoys.(b) The purported Egyptian abrogation of the Immunities Convention alsoimplied the renunciation of the 1921 Customs Agreement by which theBritish forces were permitted to import various goods into the canal zone free of charge. The agents of the shipping companies have therefore been subjected to numerous Egyptian fines for handling black-listed cargo conveyed to the military ports and for other &quot; illegal&quot; actsand may also receive demands for the payment of considerable arrears of customs duty on such goods.Legal position. In regard to freedom of Transit, Article 1 of the Suez Canal convention of 1888 says that &quot; The Suez Maritime Canal shall always be free and open in timeof war as in time of peace to every vessel of commerce or of war without distinctionof flag.&quot; The signatories of this Convention were Great Britain, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia and Turkey. The originalArticle 8, which provided that the agents in Egypt of the signatory Powers shouldwatch over the execution of the Convention, was never put into effect and theresponsibility for safeguarding freedom of transit has devolved mainly upon Egypt.In regard to the wording of Article 9 of the Convention, &quot; In case the egyptian government should not have sufficient means at its disposal it shall call upon theImperial Ottoman Government,&quot; we hold that Her Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom have inherited the responsibility of the Imperial ottoman government (see legal notes attached to this paper Annex 1).6. The instrument by which the Canal is operated is the 99-year Concessiongranted to the Suez Canal Company by the Ottoman Government. It expires in1968, by which time new arrangements will have to be made. Although the canal company is an Egyptian Company, the management is in Paris and the technical personnel are French. In 1949 a new Convention was negotiated by the company and the Egyptian Government which increased the latter&apos;s royalty to 7 per cent,of the gross profits and accelerated the rate of Egyptianisation of the Company&apos;services in Egypt. The Wafd resisted the passing of the 1949 Convention although in general they did not infringe its terms during their period of office.Presence of British Land Forces7. Legal position apart, there is no doubt that the presence of British land forces in the Canal Zone in accordance with the provision of the 1936 Treaty isa deterrent to precipitate action by the Egyptians although the object of the treaty was joint Anglo-Egyptian defence against outside attacks. In modification of thisgeneralisation one may add (a) that the presence of troops in the Canal Zone hasbeen built up by Egyptian propaganda to be the main obstacle to friendly Anglo-Egyptian relations and (b) that if the Egyptians really made up their mind to interferewith the Canal the presence of British troops in the Treaty area alone would, becauseof the very length of the Canal, be ineffective in stopping them. Nevertheless solong as it is impossible to rely on a comparatively responsible Government remaining in power, the withdrawal of troops would facilitate Egyptian action and would render far more difficult a repetition of emergency operations such as the royal navy undertook at the end of 1951.British Interests Involved8. A stoppage of free transit through the Canal would have a disastrous effect upon British trade with all countries East of Suez including members of the Common-wealth. The Canal is of more importance to the world to-day than ever before.The net tonnage passing through last year was nearly double that passing in 1939,British ships constitute about one-third being at least double that under any otherflag and in addition a proportion of the tonnage of other flags passing through,
Vticularly tankers, is chartered to British interests. Even a temporary reversion to the Cape route would have most damaging consequences, with increased costs and disruption of trade. This is particularly true in the case of oil, which in 1951represented 72 per cent, in weight of all northbound traffic through the Canal.The refineries which have been built in the United Kingdom since the war, at a cost of  165 million, rely on shipments from the Persian Gulf for 60 per cent, oftheir crude oil. Since the world tanker fleets are already fully occupied, this volumeof imports could not be maintained over the. longer Cape route, even with dollarchartering. A shortage of petroleum products in this country would thereforefollow almost immediately on any interruption of Canal traffic.9. The consequences of delays in Canal passages, without a complete stoppage,would also be serious. Delays could arise not only through deliberate Egyptianinterference but also through inefficient operation if inexperienced Egyptianpersonnel took charge of Canal operations. The anxiety of the British shipping industry about the future both of the Canal and of the Canal Company was expressedby a delegation which met the Secretary of State for the Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power, and the Minister of Transport, in March this year. If the canal company were interfered with, reduced efficiency of operation or Egyptian attempts to use it for revenue purposes would probably result in the raising of transit duesand Her Majesty&apos;s Government, along with other users of the Canal, would suffer from the increased freight charges. This would impair our ability to meet growingJapanese competition in Middle Eastern and Far Eastern markets.10. If the Canal Company&apos;s concessions were terminated by Egypt, theExchequer would be deprived of revenue amounting to  3 million a year which her Majesty&apos;s Government might reasonably expect to continue until 1968 asrevenue on its holding in the Suez Canal Company. Without going as far as this theEgyptian Government- might attempt (as they have already done) to prevent thepayment of this revenue in sterling.Interests of Other Powers11. The annexed memorandum (Annex 2) shows the nationality of the ship-ping passing through the Suez Canal in 1951. After the United Kingdom, the mainshipping countries involved are the Scandinavian countries (especially Norway),France, the United States, the Netherlands and Italy. The same countries werethe main countries of destination of goods passing through the Canal in a northerlydirection. Australia, New Zealand, India and Pakistan are, in terms of goods sentand received, big users of the Canal. Japan is also likely to resume its place amongthe principal users. Western Europe relies on shipments from the Persian Gulffor approximately 50 per cent, of its oil requirements and supplies could not bemaintained if the Canal were closed. Moreover, storage capacity is limited andeven a temporary interruption of traffic would entail serious oil shortages.12. While many other countries share our interest in maintaining sea transport, there has in fact been little response to overtures by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the French Government to obtain the support of other countriesin keeping the Canal open. On the other hand, fresh diplomatic action has been pressed upon us by the Government of Israel. On 6th June the Israel represen-tative at the United Nations proposed to Sir Gladwyn Jebb and his United Statesand French colleagues that:  (a) If there were an early settlement of Anglo-Egyptian negotiations and thesettlement did not include the lifting of the blockade, the three Govern-ments should at once take up this point with the Egyptians;(b) That if the settlement were long delayed the three Governments shouldtake it up anyway as a separate issue.The Scandinavian countries have also shown interest in the possibilities of freshdiplomatic action, but have confined their attention to the situation whch would occur after the expiry of the Suez Canal Company&apos;s concession. The ScandinavianShipowners&apos; Association recently recommended the internationalisation of the canal under the United Nations with Great Britain as the political mandatoryPower and with the Suez Canal Company as economic administrator. We havenot encouraged this approach any more than we have encouraged the Israel Govern-ment to press for action on the Security Council resolution since we hoped to make progress in bilateral negotiations with the Egyptians on defence.42653 b 2
B613. Distinct from their interest in the freedom of transit, the French Goverf&quot;)ment have a strong interest in the position of the Canal Company. Most of the shares are held by private French investors. They have therefore been more forth-coming than any of the other Governments approached during our difficulties withthe Egyptians last winter. In reply to the invitation from Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to consider providing a warship to be stationed alongside the Royal Navyvessels in Suez or Port Said, the French Government proposed a meeting between representatives of the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Norway, theNetherlands and Italy to concert a plan of action. Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere willing to accept this suggestion, but in fact it was. not followed up becausethe fall of the Wafd Government put an end to the immediate emergency.14. The United States Government, because of their interest in the PanamaCanal, would not wish to encourage any general demand for the internationalsafeguarding of all international waterways.15. The Arab States might well regard any attempts to obtain further safe-guards for the free transit of the Canal as primarily designed to further the interestsof Israel by removing Egyptian restrictions on the passage through the Suez Canalof goods bound for that country.Necessary Action16. In view of the large British interests involved and the extent to which theyare shared by other countries, it is incumbent upon Her Majesty&apos;s Government totake steps to consult the main maritime powers in order to forestall action by anill-disposed Egyptian Government. These steps may be divided into twophases:  (a) consultation with the main maritime Powers, which should take place assoon as possible;(b) an approach by the maritime Powers to the Egyptian Government, the timing of which should be decided at a later stage, bearing in mind,inter alia the state of Anglo-Egyptian relations at the time.17.   While, to preserve our rights under it, we wish the 1888 Convention toremain in force, there is no advantage in revising it.   Russia was a signatory and *the Soviet Union would never agree to co-operate over the Canal. Moreover, ofthe other signatory Powers, Austria-Hungary has ceased to exist and Germany,Spain and Turkey are not now leading maritime countries. Ideally, we should wish to see the present leading maritime Powers take up the struggle for freedomof transit where the signatories of the 1888 Convention left off. We would have tokeep the friendly ex-signatories of the Convention informed of what we were proposing to do, but there would be no necessity to invite them to a Conference.18. The French Government suggested that in addition to the United States,France and ourselves an approach should be made to Norway, the netherlands and Italy. Sweden and Denmark, who have shown a strong interest in this question,might also be approached. No wider representation would be necessary at the outset and the consortium which it is hoped will emerge from the meeting shouldbe on a narrow basis, in order that any necessary action may be concerted withease and promptitude. The old Commonwealth countries, however, should alsobe kept informed.19. If a conference were held. Her Majesty&apos;s Government might propose thatthe main maritime Powers should approach the present Egyptian Governmentjointly and request:  (a) A reaffirmation by Egypt of the principle of free transit of the Canal and aclarification of what Egypt understands by this term.(b) Recognition of the special interests of the main maritime Powers in the safeguarding of freedom of transit and in the position of the Canal tCompany.(c) An undertaking to refer any complaints of violation of the free use of the canal to the International Court of Justice at The Hague, to abide by its judgment and to refrain from repeating the act complained of untilits judgment had been given.(d) An assurance that the unhampered operation of the Canal Company wouldbe maintained at any rate until the expiry of its concession in 1968.
I 20. In addition to this joint demarche to the Egyptian Government we might^explore how far the other maritime Powers would undertake to intervene if theEgyptian Government refused to give or broke any of these undertakings or other-wise interfered with the freedom of transit or failed to protect international shipping.We might also discuss whether we could do any more to protect the status of the suez Canal Company from being altered or the servants of the Canal company from being intimidated in such a way as to render it incapable of running the Canalefficiently.21.   Such possible joint measures would be:  (a) Joint diplomatic action.(b) Prompt joint use of such international machinery as may be consideredappropriate.(c) If these measures were ineffective, agreement by France, Italy and theNetherlands (in accordance with Article VII of the 1888 Convention)to join with Her Majesty&apos;s Government in placing warships at the entrance to the Canal and in general to act as the Royal Navy were obliged to act last October.(d) Agreement to take ships through the Canal without Customs clearance ifrestrictions were applied by means of arbitrary Customs and otherregulations over and above what Egypt is entitled to apply underArticle XV of the Convention.(e) If these measures still proved ineffective, to consider what further action could be jointly taken to bring pressure to bear upon the egyptian government.22. No guarantees that might be obtained from the Egyptian Governmentnor measures adopted by the maritime Powers could be regarded as effective unless they led to the removal of Egyptian contraband control or cargoes passing throughthe Canal for Israel. Indeed this would be among the first issues to be consideredby the consortium if it were set up, although we should be reluctant to be furtherimplicated in the dispute between Israel and the Arab States. Not only Egypt, butalso all other Arab States would be strongly opposed to any measures designed tobreak their blockade against Israel; and before a decision was taken to adopt thoseforeshadowed in paragraph 21 above it would be necessary to give further con-sideration to the possible adverse effect of such Arab opposition on United Kingdomand other Western interests.Conclusion and Recommendation23. (a) An ill-disposed Egyptian Government might at any time restrict orstop traffic going through the Suez Canal either by direct obstruction or by applyingpressure on the Suez Canal Company.(b) In view of the heavy British interests involved and the extent to which theyare shared by other countries, 1 recommend to my colleagues that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should suggest to the French Government that they should, in con-junction with Her Majesty&apos;s Government, revive their proposal for a confidentialexchange of views between the maritime Powers-(i) to consider a joint approach to the present Egyptian Government in orderto obtain firmer guarantees; and(ii) to explore the possibilities of joint action in the event of failure by theEgyptian Government to give such guarantees or to maintain freedomof transport and to safeguard the Canal Company.(c) I consider that this consultation with the maritime Powers should takeplace as soon as possible. The timing of any approach by the maritime Powers-tothe Egyptian Government should be decided later, bearing in mind inter alia thestate of Anglo-Egyptian relations at the time.24.   I annex draft despatches to Paris and to the other countries concerned.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.J,28th July, 1952.
ANNEX 1Note on the Responsibility of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, Inherited fromthe Ottoman Government, to Safeguard Freedom of Transit throughthe Suez CanalArticle 9 of the Suez Canal Convention of 1888 provided that the egyptian government should take the necessary measures for ensuring the execution of theConvention. &quot; In case the Egyptian Government should not have sufficient means at its disposal it shall call upon the Imperial Ottoman Government.&quot;2. The process by which the United Kingdom has succeeded to the positionof Turkey as defined in the Suez Canal Convention of 1888 is as follows:-Article 152 of the Treaty of Versailles with Germany 1919 provides:&quot; Germany consents in so far as she is concerned to the transfer to HisBritannic Majesty&apos;s Government of the powers conferred on His imperial majesty the Sultan by the convention signed at Constantinople on 29th October,1888, relating to the free navigation of the Suez Canal. She renounces allparticipation in the Sanitary Maritime and Quarantine Board of Egypt andconsents in so far as she is concerned to the transfer to the Egyptian authorities of the powers of that board.&quot;Article 107 of the Treaty of St. Germain with Austria and Article 91 ofthe Treaty of Trianon with Hungary contained (with the substitution in eachcase of Austria and Hungary for Germany) identical provisions.3. By her declaration of 28th February, 1922, terminating the British Pro-tectorate over Egypt, the British Government expressly reserved the security of the communications of the British Empire in Egypt, meaning thereby the Suez Canal.Accordingly, the recognition granted by Great Britain to the State of Egypt by that declaration was subject to the reservation of all the legal rights of Great Britain inregard to the Suez Canal; and no legal rights in the Suez Canal, by virtue only ofthat declaration, passed to Egypt.4. By Article 17 of the Treaty of Lausanne 1923 Turkey renounced all herrights and titles over Egypt and the Sudan as from 5th November, 1914. Thisrenunciation undoubtedly covered any legal rights Turkey might have had inregard to the Suez Canal.5. Article 99 of the Treaty of Lausanne brought the convention of 1888 once more into force between Turkey and the other parties to that convention, subjectto the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne as a whole and of Article 19 inparticular.6. Article 19 of the Treaty of Lausanne provides that any question arisingout of the recognition of the State of Egypt shall be settled by. agreements to be negotiated subsequently in a manner to be determined later by the parties con-cerned. It may be said that the British Declaration of 1922 and the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 are such an agreement within the meaning of Article 19.7. On the coming into force of the Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey&apos;s rights andtitles under the Suez Canal Convention passed to Great Britain by virtue of that treaty combined with the Treaties of Trianon, St. Germain and Versailles.8. It may be objected that the British Protectorate over Egypt was proclaimedon 18th December, 1914, whereas it was from 5th November, 1914, that Turkeyrenounced her rights under Article 17 of the Treaty of Lausanne. The5th November, 1914, was the date of the outbreak of war between Turkey andGreat Britain. It may be argued that by virtue of the retrospective provision ofArticle 17 Turkey&apos;s suzerainty ceased as from 5th November, whereas actually theBritish Protectorate, not having been proclaimed until 18th December, did notpurport to terminate Turkey&apos;s suzerainty until that date. It might be suggested,therefore, that there was a gap of one month during which Egypt must have succeeded to the position of Turkey as regards the defence of the Canal. Accordingto this view no rights would accrue to Great Britain under the convention of 1888,and her position in regard to the Canal rests only and exclusively on the treatyof 1936.
9. This argument is believed to be false, because the British claim to besuccessor to Turkey under the convention does not rest upon the protectorate, butupon the Treaty of Lausanne, by which alone, in law, Turkish suzerainty was finally extinguished as from 5th November, 1914. The legal position is determinedby the text of that treaty taken with the other Treaties of Peace.10. It may also be contended that the Treaties of Peace with Germany,Turkey, Austria and Hungary were, so far as Egypt is concerned, re-inter alios actceand not binding upon her.   There are two answers to this argument:  (a) Egypt herself was not a party to the convention of 1888 and consequentlycould have no voice in its revision or in the adaptation of its provisions to the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire.(b) (which is conclusive) Egypt has in fact by Article VIII of the Treaty of1936 recognised the position of Great Britain as successor to Turkey.In Article VIII of the Treaty of 1936 the Egyptian Government haveadmitted the vital importance of the Suez Canal to the British Empire andthe right of the United Kingdom to assure that it is adequately protectedat all normal times in the future either by British and Egyptian forcestogether or by a sufficiency of Egyptian forces alone or in times ofemergency by the forces of both countries;. The right, therefore, of theUnited Kingdom instead of Turkey to take action to defend the Canalin the second resort, already recognised by other Powers, has now been recognised by Egypt.11. Of the original parties of the convention of 1888 Spain and the Nether-lands alone were not signatories of the Treaties of Peace 1919 and 1923; but theyhave not raised any question regarding the legal position of Great Britain asrecognised by these treaties.ANNEX 2The Movement of Shipping through the Suez Canal during 1951Country of OriginUnited KingdomNorway   .........United States    ......France    .........Panama   .........Italy       .........Netherlands      ......Liberia    .........DenmarkSweden   .........Greece    .........HondurasIndia      ......Germany.........Portugal ...      ...Poland    .........Belgium   .........Russia     .........SpainEgypt    -----   -.....Turkey    ... ......Finland   ... ......Switzerland ...      ...Costa Rica ...China     ... ......Pakistan ... ......Japan     ......Number of Ships	Passing Through-	Grossthe Canal	Tonnage4,091	37,040,6111,496	14,892,8201,034	10,438,350877	9,097,696822    &apos;	8,578,265895	6,676,619560	5,157,042219	3,280,262356	3,162,820290	2,525,619257	1,990,54468	1,139,06499	732,52081	578,43650	450,02357	470,69048	439,99469	361,04739	286,08696	278,63229	224,12330	196,67315	136,15424	74,9407 -&apos;	54,9.6816	60,3166	50,754

The proposal has remained in abeyance, largely because subsequent Egyptian Governments, while not going so far as to repeal anyof the restrictive measures imposed by the Wafd Administration, have been disposed to try to find ways out of Anglo-Egyptian differences by negotiation and have madea considerable effort to reduce the tension in the Canal Zone. For this reason ithas not so far been necessary to call for any further effort on the part of the maritime Powers at this juncture.2. It is still a fact, however, that an ill-disposed Egyptian Government might at any time restrict or stop traffic going through the Suez Canal either by directobstruction or by applying pressure on the Suez Canal Company. The moment is therefore suitable for the French Government to revive, in conjunction with her majesty&apos;s Government, their proposal for a confidential exchange of views betweenthe maritime Powers (a) to consider a joint approach to the present Egyptian Government in orderto obtain firmer guarantees; and(b) to explore the possibilities of joint action in the event of failure by theEgyptian Government to give such guarantees or to maintain freedomof transit and to safeguard the Canal Company.3. The French Government have recently informally indicated that in theview of their representatives in the Middle East the seven sponsoring Powers ofthe Middle East Defence Organisation might jointly declare that they attach greatimportance, from the point of view of defence, to the maintenance in full force ofthe 1888 Convention regarding free transit of the Canal. I consider, however,that defence is a separate question from that of freedom of transit through the canal and that neither will be served by linking the two together; that the sevensponsoring Powers of the Middle East Defence Organisation are not the most appropriate ones to make such an approach which could more suitably come fromthe main maritime Powers; and that such a declaration would be regarded by theArab States as directed against the Egyptian restrictions on traffic through the canal to Israel and would therefore prejudice the Middle East Defence Organisa-tion in their eyes. I do not intend to take further note of the French suggestionunless and until it is formally made to Her Majesty&apos;s Government.The Movement of Shipping through the Suez Canal during 1951-(continued^
4. You should accordingly approach the French Government and suggestthat the time has come to renew, in conjunction with Her Majesty&apos;s Government,their proposal of last January and to hold a meeting of the main maritime Powersinterested in this question. The French proposal was made to the Governmentsof the United Kingdom, the United States, Norway, the Netherlands and Italy.I consider that the Governments of Denmark and Sweden, which have showninterest in this question, should be likewise invited, but that there should be nofurther extension of invitations, in order that as a result of this and later discussionsthere may emerge a nucleus of maritime Powers prepared to take joint action at any moment when it may become necessary.5. Recent events have shown that there is a real need for the maritime Powersto obtain new assurances from the present Egyptian Government. In discussingthis with the Government to which you are accredited, you should, if you think fit,give them some intimation of the sort of assurances which Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment think might be obtained through a joint approach. These are i(a) a reaffirmation of the principle of free transit of the Canal and a clarifica-tion of what Egypt understands by that term. The object of thiswould be (i) to provide a better basis than does the 1888 Convention for further action if either the freedom of the Canal or the position of theCompany were jeopardised; and(ii) to have the principle of free transit of the Canal under-written by amore representative group of maritime nations than the signa-tories of the 1888 Convention.(b) Recognition of the special interests of the main maritime Powers in the safe-guarding of freedom of transit and in the position of the Canal Company.(c) An undertaking to refer any complaint of violation of the free use of the canal to the International Court of Justice at The Hague, to abide by itsjudgment and to refrain from repeating the act complained of until itsjudgment had been given.(d) An assurance that the unhampered operation of the Canal Company wouldbe maintained until the expiry of its concession.6. In addition to the question of these assurances Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould also wish, in the course of such a meeting, to discover what support theycould count on from other maritime Powers and what measures they would beprepared to take to intervene effectively if at any future date the Government ofEgypt refused to give these assurances or failed to carry out its legal obligations under the 1888 Convention or any other assurances that it might give to the maritime Powers, or in any other way tried to interfere with international shipping.You should therefore at your discretion pursue the matter further and suggest thatif the idea of a meeting is acceptable it is essential that the participants should notconfine themselves to legal issues. You should point out that the present world-widecommitments of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, like those of the French Government,would make it difficult for them to intervene if the situation in Egypt againdeteriorated in such a way as to impede freedom of transit or to jeopardise theposition of the Canal Company. The presence of British troops in the Canal zone in accordance with the 1936 Treaty has without doubt been a deterrent against anyparticipate Egyptian action. Should these forces be withdrawn either as a resultof an agreement with Egypt or for any other reason, effective intervention will bemore difficult. Her Majesty&apos;s Government would hope that other maritime powers could be persuaded to agree on the measures which they could jointly adopt through their diplomatic representatives in Egypt in certain given circumstances.7. Should the French Government agree that their proposal for a confidentialexchange of views between the maritime Powers be revived, the French Governmentand Her Majesty&apos;s Government could in advance of the meeting discuss the possiblejoint measures which should be taken if the circumstances outlined above shouldmake them necessary. Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be ready to discuss thisquestion at any time after the middle of [ ].   The conference itself might take place in London in [ ].8. It is, of course, important to all concerned that no publicity should be givento this conference until the Governments in question agree that it is expedient.  A
premature release might have a serious effect on the relations of all countries coiiflcerned with Egypt. It is therefore essential that the purpose of your approach bekept secret.9. I am enclosing for Your Excellency&apos;s own information a paper which dealswith this subject in greater detail.10. I am sending copies of this despatch for their information to Her Majesty&apos;representatives at Washington, Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Rome, The Hague,Cairo, B.M.E.O. Fayid, Athens, Brussels, Ankara, Tokyo, Panama, Moscow, TelAviv, Madrid, Wahnerheide, Bagdad, Beirut, Damascus, Jedda and to the UnitedKingdom Delegation to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the united nations.ANNEX 4Draft Despatch to The Hague, Washington, Oslo, Copenhagen,Stockholm, RomeI enclose for Your Excellency&apos;s consideration a copy of a paper on the steps which should be taken to safeguard the free transit of the Suez Canal and the futureof the Suez Canal Company. You will see that this paper reaches the conclusionthat in view of the heavy British interests involved and the extent to which they areshared by other countries, it is incumbent on Her Majesty&apos;s Government to take steps to consult the main maritime Powers in order to forestall action by an ill-disposed Egyptian Government against the freedom either of the Canal or of the canal Company.2. I am enclosing also a copy of a despatch which has been sent to her majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris, instructing him to invite the French Governmentto revive the proposal already made by that Government for a meeting of the maritime Powers, to discuss how to provide for the continued operation of the suez canal in the event of a deterioration of the situation in Egypt.3. This suggestion is being made in the first place to the French Governmentbecause of (a) the special interest taken by that Government in the future of the canal and in particular of the Canal Company, and(b) the fact that such a proposal has already been made by the FrenchGovernment.Her Majesty&apos;s Government, however, fully realise the interest taken in this question by the Government to which you are accredited, and it is their intention that, ifthe French response is favourable, that Government should thereafter be formallyconsulted.4. You should not, therefore, make any proposal to the Government to which you are accredited until the attitude of the French Government is known.5.

You will see that this paper reaches the conclusionthat, in view of the heavy British interests involved and the extent to which they are
Jhared by other countries, it is incumbent on Her Majesty&apos;s Government to take steps to consult the main maritime Powers in order to forestall action by anill-disposed Egyptian Government against the freedom either of the Canal or of the canal Company.2. I enclose also a copy of a despatch which has been sent to Her Majesty&apos;ambassador at Paris, instructing him to approach the French Government with aview to reviving the proposal already made by that Government for a meeting of the maritime Powers to discuss how to provide for the continued operation of the suez canal in the event of a deterioration of the situation in Egypt.3. It is not proposed that the Government to which you are accredited shouldbe invited to take part in the suggested meeting of the martime Powers, since it isconsidered that the consortium which Her Majesty&apos;s Government hope will emerge from this meeting should be on a narrow basis, in order that any necessary action may be concerted with ease and promptitude. Her Majesty&apos;s Government, however,recognise that the Government to which you are accredited, as signatory of the suez Canal Convention of 1888, are likely to take an interest in any steps which are taken to safeguard freedom of transit through the Suez Canal.4. You should not, at the present moment, give to that Government any indication of the approach which Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris has been instructed to make to the French Government.5. This despatch is also addressed to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Ankara andto the High Commissioner at Wahnerheide, and is being sent for information to alexandria, Paris, B.M.E.O. Fayid, Athens, Brussels, Tokyo, Panama, Moscow, TheHague, Washington, Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Rome, Tel Aviv and the UnitedKingdom Delegations to N.A.T.O. and the United Nations.
