o -   .Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1952SECRET Copy No.    7C, (52) 26125 th July, 1952CABINETPROVISIONAL LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME: 1952/53 session memorandum by the Lord Privy seal the Committee appointed by the Cabinet on 15th May (C.C. (52) 53rd Con-clusions, Minute 4) has examined the proposals of Departments for legislation inthe 1952/53 Session and has prepared the appended lists of Bills, classified asfollows:  I Bills which should be enacted by Christmas 1952.II Bills which should be enacted between Christmas 1952 and Easter 1953.Ill Bills which should be enacted between Easter 1953 and the summer recess.IV Bills which should be enacted during the Session but to which no specificdate is attached. Some of these could be introduced early in the session.V -Bills which might be introduced if time permits.VI Bills which the Committee think must be omitted from the programme in order to keep it to reasonable proportions.Within each list the Bills are shown in alphabetical order. Consolidation Bills arenot included.The Programme before Christmas2. The programme in the House of Commons before Christmas is bound tobe very congested. After allowing twelve days for the Transport Bill and two daysfor the Iron and Steel Bill not more than three days can be relied upon for other government legislative business. It is therefore not possible to contemplateadditions to the programme suggested for this period if the Committee Stage ofthe Transport Bill is to be completed by Christmas. I must impress upon theCabinet the strain which will in any case be imposed on Members by the programme in view for this period (and, indeed, for the remainder of the Session also). Sincenone of the Bills to be included are suitable for introduction in the House of Lords,it is contemplated that suitable Bills from List II and, if necessary, other lists shouldbe introduced and proceeded with in the House of Lords during that period.The Programme for the remainder of the Session3. The programme suggested for the remainder of the Session is intended atthis stage only as an outline which will certainly require to be modified in the lightof changing conditions. It is desirable, however, to exclude from the programme at the earliest possible stage those Bills which there seems to be no possibility what-ever of enacting in order that Departments and Parliamentary Counsel mayconcentrate on those which will or may be needed.4. I must ask my colleagues to refrain from making public promises of legis-lation on the strength of the inclusion of any subject in whatever provisional programme may be approved by the Cabinet. The Parliamentary prospects are such that there can be no certainty of securing the enactment of even the majority42648 b
of the Bills which are so included and unfulfilled promises of legislation encourVu!the unfortunate impression that the Government is unable to carry out its declaredintentions.5. It seems improbable that there will be time for more than one major Billapart from the Finance Bill, the Transport Bill and the Iron and Steel Bill. If theCabinet feel that a fourth major Bill should be provisionally included at this stage,the choice would seem to lie between the following subjects, all of which are atpresent included in List V (Bills which might be introduced if time permits):  . Leasehold; Long Leases (Scotland).Monopolies and Restrictive Practices.Town and Country Planning (Amendment).The position about these matters is, briefly, as follows:  Leasehold; Long Leases (Scotland)Standstill Bills (included in List II) will be required in any case to hold the position when the Leasehold Property (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1951,and the corresponding Scottish Act expire on 24th June and 10th May, 1953,respectively. The Government will be exposed to criticism from both sides ofthe House for prolonging the existing position in England and Wales and thepassage of the necessary Standstill Bill would be greatly facilitated if, when itwas debated in Parliament, a comprehensive Bill, which could not in any casebecome operative in time to make a Standstill Bill unnecessary, had been introduced. If a major English Leasehold Bill were introduced, a correspondingScottish Bill would almost certainly be necessary also.Monopolies and Restrictive PracticesA Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Bill was promised in the late King&apos;sSpeech on the opening of the present Parliament and not to proceed with iteven in the next Session would be bound to expose the Government to criticism.Town and Country Planning (Amendment)A Standstill Bill will have to be passed not later than 1st July, 1953, what-ever decision may eventually be reached on the proposals of the Minister of housing and Local Government in C. (52) 228. There will undoubtedly be pressure upon the Government to disclose its full plans for amending the 1947Act.Policy decisions have not yet been taken upon any of these three matters but even a tentative conclusion by the Cabinet that one of them seemed likely to havethe strongest claims to inclusion in the programme would help to accelerate thenecessary decisions and enable the draftsmen to concentrate on the subject selected.conclusions.   I invite the Cabinet (i) to approve the provisional legislative programme for the 1952-53 Sessionoutlined in the lists appended to this memorandum;(ii) to consider whether major legislation, apart from the Finance Bill, theTransport Bill and the Iron and Steel Bill should be provisionallyincluded in the programme and, if so, whether this is most likely totake the form of Bills on Leasehold Reform and Long Leases (Scotland),a Bill on Monopolies and Restrictive Practices, or a Town and country planning (Amendment) Bill.H.
