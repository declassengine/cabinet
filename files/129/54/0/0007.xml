THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government primed for the Cabinet. My 1952SECRET      &apos;- ,copy no.71C. (52) 257 CABINET OFFiCr .&apos; .23rd July,1952   . RECOnD COPY --.CABINETREARMAMENT AND PUBLIC OPINIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs am a little disturbed at recent indications that public expressions of satisfac-tion about the increased strength of the West and the reduced chances of Sovietaggression, however justifiable in themselves, may create the impression that weare out of the wood and can afford to relax our efforts. Her Majesty&quot;s ambassador in Brussels has recently reported that authoritative statements of this kind arealready lessening the will to keep up.the defence effort in Belgium. And in othercountries, opposition to the defence effort, particularly in France and Germany,is already so strong that it is vital not to give it further encouragement.2. It is of course true that the West is relatively much stronger than, say, ayear ago, and it is right that this should be said publicly, not only to give warning to the Communists but to show our own public opinion that they are getting somereturn for their sacrifices under the rearmament programme. But we need to strike a careful balance between statements calculated to encourage opinion inthe West and the real facts of the situation, i.e., the basic hostility of the Sovietregime and of Communist doctrine, and the continued disparity between the forcesof the West and those of the Soviet and Satellite bloc,3. I hope therefore that my colleagues will qualify any reassuring statementsthey may make about our increased strength by emphasising also that the needfor rearmament continues. We should make it clear that the Soviet and Satelliteforces still enjoy a substantial preponderance and that it is Communist policy asa whole, arid not merely the varying risks of Soviet aggression, which makes itnecessary for the Western Powers to be strong.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,23rd July, 195242616
