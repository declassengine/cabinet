I think itmay be helpful if I outline briefly the kind of problem which confronts myself and I think, in general terms, my other Service colleagues.2,        We refer constantly to the  4,700M. Rearmament Programme,   This isa deceptive title.   Of the so-called Rearmament Programme total of  4,700m. only about  1,600M. is actually to be spent on rearmament in the true sense ofthe word, i. e. the manufacture of new weapons and equipment.   The remainderis being spent on the in scapable cost of maintaining large forces in peacetime, many of them overseas.   Therefore, to spread the  4,700M, over a longer period of years is to increase the proportion of it given inescapablyto yearly maintenance and thus to reduce the sum left over for new weapons andequipment.   With our present large defence forces, and because of the largedeficiencies in upHxrdate weapons, caused by sales and neglect between 1945-1951,a marked reduction in the sum available for making new weapons and equipment would leave our forces ill-equipped for a long time ahead.Rise in cost, The total budgetary figure for the Army for 1952/3 was  522M.That proposed by the costing of the Chiefs of Staff Global Strategy paper for1953/4 which outlined minimum forces and was approved in principle by theDefence Committee, amounted to  636M.   Such a large rise in expenditure is naturally alarming in view.of our very serious economic difficulties.   Thenecessity to avoid a continuation of such a marked increase in annual expenditure is fully appreciated.   Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that the increasein the total budgetary figure for 1953/54 is for the most part caused by newcharges, of which the most important is Germany, and by price increases.This is shown in Table I.Methods of Reduction4, I fully realise the urgent need for economy in Defence expenditure,but a close examination of the problem does not appear to disclose anyfeasible solution unless we drastically reduce our commitments^ The Army&apos;s share of the 1953/54 total budgetary figure costed in the light or the GlobalStrategy paper amounts to  636M.   This can be divided into three categories.First, there is the inescapable hard core which comprises the cost of paying,feeding, transporting etc. an Army of the present size.Secondly there is the expenditure on works, a large proportion ofwhich is required for maintaining old or temporary living accommodation,
Lifeliving a comparatively small amount for new building for such essential.. vings as covered storage for new equipment.   Lastly, there is the expenditureon production where the growing demands of maintenance are such that little more than one half will be available for new weapons and equipment.There are therefore two fields for economy;  first, by reducing thetotal budgetary figure wherein the main saving must be made in hard coreexpenditure;  and secondly, within the financially smaller but economicallymore important field of the metal-using industries.   I give below a briefexamination of the two problems.Reduction in Total Budgetary Figure5. If there is to be a reduction in the total budgetary figure it can onlybe achieved, because it must largely fall on hard core expenditure, by a planneddecrease in manpower.   The present male strength of the Army is about441,000 all ranks which provides 11-^ regular divisions, practically all ofwhich are overseas.   Their present deployment is shown in Table II,   Withthe exception of those in Korea and Malaya, all fighting units are down to about60% below full strength, and the same is generally true of administrative and supporting formations.   To go below 60% would cause lack of realism intraining and is wasteful and inefficient administratively.   Therefore, any marked decrease in manpower must involve the sacrifice of fighting formations.A comparison of the list at Table II with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper(C.(52) 202) shows that such a reduction is not easy to achieve.6. Alternatively, it may be said that there is scope for reduction inthe total of about 225,000 men retained in this country, comprising trainees,training units, A,A. defence, etc.   The disbandment of 30 A.A. regiments athome has been provisionally agreed, and during the past eighteen months aconsiderable reduction within administrative and training units has been made.Although some further saving might be possible, I am entirely convinced that nothing approaching a total large enough to have a marked effect on solving the problem with which the Government is now confronted could be found.Reduction in Metal-using Industries7, It has been agreed that the defence load on the metal-using industries for 1953 should be reduced to a figure between  450M. and  500M,This has been accepted by the Minister of Defence and all three Services,What cannot be accepted is a veto on any subsequent rise in this field of expenditure.   The reason why some rise is inevitable is best explained by comparing the Army&apos;s share of the metal-using industries for the year 1954(as given by the costing of the Global Strategy paper) with that share which theArmy would have if a level rate were held.   The costing of the Global Strategypaper gave the Army  212M. but the alternative proposal would only allow 142. 5M.   An approximate division of this expenditure, between maintenance and new services is given at Table III.   This shows that the total reduction on new services which the Army would have to make if the Chancellorsproposal of a level rate were accepted would be  69. 5M., i.e. over half.8, The conclusions which I draw from the arguments stated above are:-(a) the increase in the size of the total budgetary figure for1953 is largely attributable to the addition of certain charges and to price increases;
any drastic reduction in this total budgetary figuremust be accompanied by some reduction in the numberof fighting formations;(c)      if the Chancellors proposals for restrictions in expenditure on defence in the metal-using industries duringthe next two or three years are accepted there will be aserious shortage of up-to-date weapons in the Army.9o I am very well aware of the Chancellor&apos;s urgent problem and theneed to find some solution.   A decision concerning (b) above is outside mysphere of responsibility;    but where (c) is concerned, if we do continueto maintain a large Army,   it is my duty to ensure that a reasonable proportionof these men are in possession of some up-to^ate weapons, with a sufficientbacking of reserves to enable them to meet the initial impact of war.A.H.War Office, S.W.1.28th JULY, 1952,
