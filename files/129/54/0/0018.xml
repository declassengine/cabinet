(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential   IC.(52) 268 COPY NO.   Q (28TH JULY, 1952CABINET&quot;OPERATION TIN&quot; CONCLUDEDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster i am glad to be able to inform the Cabinet of the satisfactory conclusion of &quot;Operation Tin&quot;.2. Under the agreement made by the Prime Minister with the Presidentof the United States we undertook to deliver 20,000 tons of tin during 1952 at a fixed price of $1.18 a lb. ( 944 a ton).   This offer was extremely valuable in thenegotiations over steel, while so far as tin was concerned, our object was to break the impasse which had arisen owing to the refusal of the Americans to buy tinthrough the normal market machinery or to pay current market prices.   By so doingwe hoped (a) to restore the substantial dollar earnings from the sale of Malayan tinto the United States and (b) to bring the Americans back into the market.   Tosecure these advantages we took the risk that the price of tin would be forced wellabove  944 a ton and indeed at the time we estimated a loss of at least  -f million to the Exchequer.   Some critics prophesied that the loss would be much higher.3. The operation has been much more successful than could have been expected.   Except for a few hundred tons our purchases for resale to the UnitedStates will have been completed by the end of July.   The loss in sterling on thedeal as a whole is not likely to exceed  150,000.   On the positive side of theaccountj our sales will realise about $53 millions.   The fixing of the price in theAgreement also set a price pattern for transactions outside the Agreement andinduced the Americans to buy sterling tin through other channels.   We do not knowhow much they have bought in this way but the dollars so acquired must be well inexcess of 10 millions.   What is more, we have shown the Americans that by buying ina sensible way substantial quantities of tin can be acquired without seriouslydisturbing the price.   The Americans are now keen to apply the lesson they havelearned by restoring the private import of tin, and, with every encouragement from us have decided to allow private imports again as from the 1st August.4, I am proposing to inform Parliament on 1st August of the satisfactoryoutcome of &quot;Operation Tin&quot;.   The exchange of letters releasing the Americans fromthe restrictions in force during our purchasing operation$and announcing theAmerican resumption of free buying on the market, will be published as a white Paper on the same day,SWINTONMinistry of Materials, S.W.1. ,
