It was accepted;that there were serious objectionsboth to loans at reduced rates of interest arid to the idea of Government&quot;shares&quot;.   I was invited to work out a scheme for giving special assistance inthe form of grants,A scheme of grants towards the cost of building fishing boats hasalready been agreed in the case of owner &quot;fishermen who go to sea as members ofthe crew.   The arrangement will be that the fisherman receives 25% of the costof his vessel as a grant, subject to a maximum of  4,000.   I have thereforesimply had to consider how this scheme can be extended to cover fishing vessels owned by Companies.I think that it is reasonable to fix a lower rate of grant in the caseof vessels which as a rule are not the property of owner-fishermen, and suggest 20%.   The over-riding maximum must necessarily be a good dealhigher, since the vessels owned by Companies are on the whole much bigger;I suggest a maximum of  16,000.   Finally, in order to make vessels of thedistant water fleet ineligible for assistance (it is accepted that they do not need it), I suggest that to qualify for a grant vessels must be of less than 140 feetin length.The arrangements could then be summarised as follows:-(l)  Grant at the rate of 25% of cost in the case of smaller vesselsowned by working fishermen, subject to a maximum of  4,000.(2)  Grant at the rate of 20% of cost in all other cases, subject to amaximum of  16,000.(3)  Vessels to be of not more than 140 feet in length in order to qualify forassistance.These proposals have been discussed between officials but theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesare not committed to them.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.,
