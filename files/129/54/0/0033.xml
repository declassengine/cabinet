Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 6 7HIM..... M...III- ,..1.............iC. (52) 28315th August, 1952CABINETAMENDMENT OF THE TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING ACT, 1947Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer think that the Minister of Housing&apos;s paper, which he has sent me while am away for a week, fairly represents the two points of view on the vexedquestion of development charge. I wish to add only two paragraphs, one politicaland the other financial.2. The Act of 1947, whether we like it or not, owes its origin not to one party only, but to the work done under a Coalition Government. To abandondevelopment charge altogether is to remove the lynchpin which preserved a degreeof equity as between the particular situation of one owner and another. If there be no such charge, planning will tend to become more rather than less centralisedunder the State. At the same time by abolishing charge we may re-create the taxation of site values controversy and place the Conservative Party in the positionof favouring the landowners at the expense of the public interest in land. We must avoid, however unwittingly, appearing to stand for sectional interests. I fear thatthe effect of making a false step over this difficult matter may well result in along-term &quot; comeback &quot; against landowners which will be alike offensive to themand injurious to the country&apos;s best interests.Moreover, in our Election manifesto &quot; Britain Strong and Free&quot; weadvocated modifications of the charge rather than its complete abolition. If chargebe abolished some tax equally unpopular may well have to be put in its place.I certainly do not feel inclined to devise a tax on site values or on unearned and&quot; fortuitous &quot; increment in land.3. Finally, the modification of the Act which I propose should be more advantageous to the Exchequer than the Ministers proposals. The economy effected by the Ministers Scheme as compared with the present Act depends entirely onholding the limitation of compensation to 1947 values. I do not believe this limitation can be held. The date 1947 is significant only in the complete context of the 1947 Act; what the Act announced was not merely that there would be no compensation for future interference with increases in development value, but alsothat there would not be unrestricted future profit from such increases, i.e., that development charges would secure equity between landowner and landowner.If development charges disappear, the equity disappears also, and the landownerrefused permission will complain, not indeed that he is being worse treated than he was promised, but that his neighbours granted permission are being very much better treated. It is not realistic to suppose that any Government could longresist the resulting pressure to abandon the &quot; arbitrary&quot; date 1947 and base,compensation on current market values; and if that happened, the Minister^scheme would mean an Exchequer liability without any limit at all. I would prefer to try and preserve the general equity of the 1947 Act. The limitation of claims on the  300 million to 1947 values could therefore be held; and in additiondevelopment charge revenue would continue to come in, and in the long run mightwell exceed the cost of the compensation.R. A. B.15th August, 1952.42774
