(THIS-^OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret(52) 270 COPY NO.29TH JULY, 1952&quot;    &quot;&quot; &quot; CABINETINCREASE OF ENGINEERING EXPORTS:  DEFERMENTOF APPRENTICESMemorandum by the Minister of supply in my paper (C. (52) 181) I recommended that the call-up of apprentices needed for export work should be deferred.2, The output of many engineering firms which are capable of expanding their exports is being severely restricted by the shortage of skilled men.   This shortage is particularly acute among the machine-tool,gauge and tool makers, who are not only substantial exporters themselves,but who provide production equipment essential to other firms engaged on export work.3. I therefore recommend:(i) that it should be decided, as a matter of policy, that the call-upof apprentices engaged on export work should be deferred on a scale commensurate with the importance which the Governmentattaches to increasing exports;(ii) that, in pursuit of this policy, the Treasury, Board of Trade,Service Departments, Ministry of Labour and Ministry of supply should together draw up a scheme for apportioning apprentices due for call-up between the Services and the export industries in themanner best calculated to serve the over-all national interest;(iii)  that as a first step, pending the completion of this scheme,the Minister of Labour should be authorised to defer the call-upof 250 trained apprentices per quarter in each of the following:-(a) the gauge, tool and machine-tool industries;  and(b) selected sections of the engineering industry engaged on important export work;(iv) that this deferment should continue for so long as the apprenticeconcerned remains engaged on t...e work, in respect of which hisdeferment was granted.D.S.Ministry of Supply, S. W.l.,
