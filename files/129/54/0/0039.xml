HIS DOCUMENT IS -THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(52) 289 COPY NO._/030TH AUGUST, 1952CABINETLONG LEASES IN scotland memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland in view of the paper circulated by the Home Secretary on the leasehold Reform Bill for England and Wales (C. (52) 277) my colleagues will wish to know the present position in Scotland.   The temporary stand-still Actfor Scotland which was passed by the Labour Government in 1951 expires onthe 10th May, 1953, so that there is even less time in Scotland than in Englandand Wales before something must be put in its place.2. In February, 1951, the Labour Government set up a Committeeon long leases in Scotland under the Chairmanship of Lord Guthrie.   ThisCommittee has now reported.   Its Report will shortly be published and I shallbe submitting proposals for a Scottish Bill giving effect to its recommendations.These differ materially from the proposals which it has been decided toinclude in the forthcoming English Bill but the differences are, I think, fully justified by the different conditions in Scotland and I should hope that theywill not embarrass us.3, I am in entire agreement with the Home Secretary that, whileit will be necessary to extend the operation of the existing temporary Acts -this could, I think, be done in one Bill for both countries ** we ought to beprepared with our permanent proposals and to bring them forward at the sametime as the extending Bill.   I shall be submitting a paper to the Home AffairsCommittee about the Scottish position very soon and, if my proposals are approved, the drafting of a Scottish Bill can be put in hand immediately.J.S.Scottish Office, S. W. 1.,30TH AUGUST, 1952.
