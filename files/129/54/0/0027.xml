CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   7C. (52) 2778th August, 1952CABINETLEASEHOLD REFORM bill memorandum by the Home secretary on 31st July (C.C. (52) 75th Conclusions, Minute 2), the Cabinet considerednext Session&apos;s legislative programme. I could not then be present and I should like my colleagues, when the matter is next considered, to be aware of the reasons why, in my view, a Leasehold Reform Bill next Session is essential.2. A Committee under Lord Uthwatt, succeeded by Lord Justice Jenkins,reported in 1950 and were unanimous on the need for permanent reform, though they differed a good deal on the form it should take.3. The Labour Government passed a temporary standstill Act in .1951, whichexpires at Midsummer 1953. They justified this on the ground that it would takea year or two for them to work out their permanent proposals, and they promised to have permanent legislation ready by 1953 and not to extend the standstill.The Conservative Opposition criticised the Government for delaying the issue,and opposed Part I of the Bill, which freezes until Midsummer 1953 long leasesof residential property occupied by the long lessee. This provision was recognised to be very hard on landlords, and justifiable only as a strictly short-term measure.Part II of the Act allows shop tenants to apply to the County Court for a newtenancy of not more than a year.4. My proposals for permanent legislation have been fully discussed by theHome Affairs Committee, and provisional decisions taken (H.A. (52) 10th, 11th and14th Meetings).5.   The subject falls into three parts:  (i) Leasehold Enfranchisement. This is attractive to some elements of theLabour Party, and figured in their Election Manifesto. I am clear thatwe should not touch it.(ii) Security of Tenure for Residential Tenants. The main proposal here isto give security of tenure, subject to certain conditions, to occupyingground lessees who, unlike other types of tenant, are outside the scopeof the Rent Acts. This will not be controversial in principle, thoughthe Opposition may dislike some of the details and argue that it shouldbe additional to, not in substitution for, leasehold enfranchisement,(iii) Security of Tenure for Business Tenants. The proposal here is tostrengthen the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1927, which does not worksatisfactorily, by giving business tenants security of tenure at anarbitrated up-to-date rent unless the landlord needs the premises himselffor business or redevelopment. This again should not be controversialin principle between the Parties.The opportunity should also be taken to make various minor and technicalamendments in the law.6. On 23rd May, 1952, the Home Affairs Committee authorised thepreparation of a Bill on the above lines. The draftsman has been instructed, anddrafting has made considerable progress.  A draft (not of course final) could be42730Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1952
ready for further consideration by the Home Affairs Committee in October, andit is possible that a Bill could be got ready for publication about the New Year.7. We may find it difficult to get the Bill through both Houses by Midsummer,for it is very technical. Even if we can, we ought to make it operate from, say,Michaelmas or Christmas 1953, to allow for a transitional period, and extend thetemporary Act for a short time accordingly.8. We certainly cannot let the temporary Act expire at Midsummer withoutputting something in its place. It would be quite acceptable to extend it for avery short period under cover of a permanent Act: it would be quite anotherthing to produce next Session merely a further standstill for an indefinite period,without at the same time producing our permanent proposals. I feel sure thatthis course would not only be quite wrong in the public interest, but would alsoexpose the Government to allegations of dilatoriness and indecision, which wouldbe most difficult to answer and most damaging politically.D. M. F.Home Office, S.W.1,8 th August, 1952.
