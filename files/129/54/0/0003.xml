(52) 25322ND JULY, 1952CABINET office record COPYCABINETTHE DEFENCE programme memorandum by the Minister of defence as the Cabinet will be called upon to take final decisionsthis week which will greatly affect the Defence Programme, I feel that mycolleagues should be clearly informed of the questions at issue.2. In August, 1950, the late Government launched a 3-yearrearmament programme, the total size of which was increased inJanuary, 1951.   The financial year 1951/52 was the first effective year ofthis programme, and the plan then approved allowed for the followingexpenditure:-1951/52 1952/53 1953/54 m1,250 1,531 1,694(actual)The above figures total  4*475 millions. The plan amounted to 4,700 millions, the difference being accounted.for by expenditure on civil defence and stockpiling.3. The programme was delayed in the first year with the .result that the actual expenditure in 1951/52 was  1,132 millions.  InDecember, 1951, a defence budget for the three years 1952/53 to 1954/55 was prepared.   This revised the original plan to allow for increase in prices, and carried it on for a further year.   The figures in this four year budget were asfollows: -1951/52 1952/53 1953/54 1954/55 ml;132 1,666 1,838 1,9164. During the course of the winter, the estimate for 1952/53was examined and a number of cuts were imposed which reduced the figure for the current financial year to  1,462 millions.  The  200 millions takenoff the estimate was largely for items which would have to be postponed to subsequent years. At the same time it was announced in Parliament thatthe three-year rearmament programme was being rolled forward to cover a longer period.
5. la March, of this year, I asked the Chiefs of staff committee to re-examine the strategic basis of our defence plans, so as toprovide for the next two or three years a policy upon which rearmamentcould proceed.  It had become evident that the rapid deyelopment of atomic weapons and the build*-up of United States strategic air power,were changing the strategic picture which had been formed two yearspreviously.  In addition, the strain on our economy called for are-examination of the scope of our rearmament, to bring it into line with what we could afford to maintain for a long period.   The outcome of this study by &quot;the Chiefs, of Staff is the memorandum on Defence Policy and GlobalStrategy (D.(52) 26.) which my colleiagues have now seen.  It should be read in conjunction with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum(C.(52) 202) on British Overseas Obligations.6. The Chiefs of Staffs memorandum has been before theDefence Committee and has been generally approved as a sound strategicpolicy.  Decisions have not yet been taken, however, on the actual size and build-up of the forces required to give effect to the policy, as set out inSection XIV of the memorandum.  It was first necessary to ascertain thecost of what was proposed and to see whether this cost was acceptable.It is not only a financial question.   It is also a que stion of whether theindustrial resources required for the rearmament programme can be spared from other vital uses.7, The costing has now been done, admittedly rather hastily,and has been carried to the year 1955/56. The resulting, figures at present prices which are in excess of the prices ruling in previous calculations, areas follows:-1952/53 1953/54 1954/55 1955/56 m1,462 1,759 1,857 1*867(actual)It will be seen that the figures for the years 1953/54 and 1954/55 are somewhat smaller than the figures of the December 1951 defence budget, whichare given in paragraph 3 above.  They would be smaller still, to the tuneof about  200 millions each year, if there had not been a number of newitems to include, namely the rise in prices ( 50 millions per annum), theprobable cost of maintaining our forces in Germany ( 70 millions to 90 millions per annum), additional duty on oil products (a book-keepingtransaction which throws  35 millions per annum on to the Defence Vote),and a number of other smaller items including  15 millions per annum forcancelled contracts.   On a strictly comparable basis, therefore, the costing of the Chiefs of Staff memorandum shows a saving of nearly  300 millions per annum in each of the next two financial years on the previous figures.8. There are two further elements in the rearmament programme which have to be looked at separately.  They are:-(a) the cost of overseas commitments in foreign exchange; and(b) the load on the metal-using industries.It is clear from the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum that there is little
hope of any reduction in our overseas commitments.  The whole of theRegular Army, amounting to 11 Divisions, is committed abroad in Germany,. the Middle East, Malaya and Korea.   We are under obligation to c-ir allies to N.A.T.O. to maintain the present land forces in Germany, to build up the tactical Air Force^ and to increase the anti-U boat and anti-mine resourcesof the Royal Navy.  Reductions in all these commitments can only be madeat the risk of grave repercussions oh the general strength and morale of the Western World, to whom our example is of great importance.9. The permissible load on the metal-using industries is thechief limitation on the speed and scale of the re-equipment of the Forces with .modern weapons.  It should be realised that during the five years following the.end of the war forces had to be maintained all over the world of a size largeby peacetime standards.   But during that period little or nothing could bedone to re-equip them with new weapons.   This was a serious matter when it is realised what strides have been made since the war, particularly in the field of aircraft, of electronics, and in all the many items of equipment on whichscientific skill has been concentrated.  When the rearmament plan was started therefore a tremendous leeway had to be made up.   Under the Chiefsof Staffs plan, which has now been costed and which considerably modifies theultimate size of the forces previously planned, re-equipment with new weaponswill not be complete until April 1958. Any substantial reduction of this plan will mean either a reduction in the size of the forces, or a still further delay in the process of re-equipment, or both.10. The load on the metal using industries of theChiefs of Staffsplan has been calculated as follows:-1952 1953 1954 1955 500M  500M  570M    ^Cannot yet be calculated,but would not be lessthan  570M.11. In the discussions that have been proceeding over the last twoor three weeks, theChancellor of the Exchequer has asked first that the totaifigure for expenditure on defence in each of the next three years should be keptdown to the current figure of  1,462 millions; secondly that the load on the metal using industries through the same three years should be kept down to 450 millions per annum.   I have agreed to re-examine the programmes and todo everything possible to reduce the load on the metal using industries for 1953from  500 millions to a lower figure by accepting reductions where it can reasonably be shown that these will benefit the export industry.   No decisions have yet been proposed for the load on the metal using industries for future years, nor upon the size of the defence budget as a whole.   I only wish, at this moment, to warn my colleagues that if the level of expenditure and resourcesdevoted to the defence programme is cut much below the level now proposed bythe Chiefs of Staff, the rearmament programme will be largely abandoned.   Weare now in the second year since the start of the original plan, and the great bulk of orders for the programme, amounting to some  1,500 millions, havealready been placed.  As everyone knows, it is in the third and fourth years of a plan that the full flow of material takes place.   A rearmament plan cannot avoid a rising curve of expenditure over the first three or four years, though there-after the curve may flatten out and possibly descend.  Drastic reductions in thesecond and third years, and the stopping of all rise in the future, merelydislocates the whole programme and ensures that the results will be inefficient
and dangerously incomplete.   I am prepared to do all I can to meet thewishe s of the Chancellor 6f the Exchequer, and it may well be that financial considerations must override others.   The Cabinet should be under no illusion,however,   They cannot have it both ways.  Severe cuts cannot be made withoutindustry, the Armed Forces, and, before long, our Allies, realising that ourrearmament programme is being emasculated and is taking second place to housing, consumer goods, and social services, which are remaining virtuallyunaffected. -A.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1.22nd July, 1952.
