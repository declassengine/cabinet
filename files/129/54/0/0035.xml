3 K* (OS tsxt 9uh tS) C3J       cE C RE TC.(52)  285 COPY NOv19TH AUGUST, 1952CABINETPERSIAMR, MIDDLETQN&apos;S CONVERSATION withdraw. MUSADDIQ ON 14TH AUGUSTMemorandum by the Minister of state in conversation with H.M.  Charge d&apos;Affaires on the 14thAugust, after Mr.  Middleton had made it clear that the Anglo-1 rani an oil Company (A.I.O. C.)  could not accept the Persian government proposal for negotiations within the framework of the Nine Point Lawand after he had,  as if on his own initiative,  suggested informal discussions without specified terms of reference,  Dr. Musaddiq putforward the following proposition:-(a) He offered arbitration by the International Court on compensation (subject to certain reservations mentioned in paragraph 4,bel ow).(b) He asked the United Kingdom for immediate financial aid.(c) He invited the A.I.O. C. to discuss the future sale of thebulk of Persian oil on commercial terms, eventually including freeoil or a discount to cover compensation.2. This proposal is very similar to the plan for a joint approach to the Persian Government put forward on the 31st July by the. state department  (Washington telegram No.  1470) with the difference that(i)    it is Dr. Musaddiq who takes the initiative;(ii)    it is the United Kingdom and not the United States which is asked to provide financial aid;(iii)    a long-term sales contract seems to be contemplated fromthe outset rather than a simple lifting of the stocks atAbadan followed &quot;promptly&quot; by negotiations for a more permanent arrangement.3. The Foreign Office were informed by the United States Embassyon the 18th August that the U.S. Ambassador at Tehran, reportinga conversation with Dr. Musaddiq on the previous day said that he,Dr. Musaddiq,  could not submit to the Majlis a suggestion for arbitration by the International Court unless he could at the same time say thatthe British had accepted the Nine Point Nationalisation Law.(TH.J3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
4. Mr. Middleton obtained the impression from his ownconversation with Dr. Musaddiq that the Persian Prime minister would not agree to mention the Concession Agreement or the NinePoint Law in the terms of reference but that he would not object to theInternational  Court hearing &quot;claims and counter-claims&quot; based on both.    His offer thus appeared to be an important step towards our point of view.    The later information received from the U. S. Embassy-puts the matter in a different light.    Indeed if we are to believe that dr. Musaddiq would be unwilling for the International Court to considerclaims arising both out of the seizure of the assets belonging to theA.I.O. C. and out of the cancellation of the Concession Agreement we are faced with an entirely different position.    It would be impossible forthis country to accept a limitation of this nature,  which would be tantamount to surrender.    From the point of view of our overseasinvestments generally nothing could be worse.5. Provided Dr. Musaddiq does not insist  on prior explicitrecognition of the Nine Point Law,  an arbitration on general terms ofreference, broadly on the lines which Mr. Middleton mentions in para-graph 4 of his telegram No.  587 of the 14th August and which he still,despite Mr. Henderson1 s report, believes would be acceptable to dr. Musaddiq,  fully safeguards our position on compensation forcancellation of the Concession and enables Her Majesty1 s Governmentto base their claims before the Court on that Agreement.    Counsel forthe A. I.O. C. are of the same opinion.    If the Court had decided lastmonth that it was competent to hear the A.I.O.C.  case it is generally agreed that it  could not  in the circumstances have done more than itwould, under Dr. Musaddiq&apos;s proposals,  now be asked to do.    Draftterms of reference acceptable t o us are given at Annex I.6. To apply to the International Court for compensation only would, however, be an important  change from the position approved bythe Cabinet when they considered the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum c. (52)  276.    In that context we were contemplating terms of referenceto include not only the normal judicial function of awarding an amountof compensation but also the non-judicial or political function of determining how the compensation awarded should actually be paid.    TheLegal Adviser to the Foreign Office and Counsel for the A.I.O.C. are agreed that it would be difficult to find an acceptable umpire who wouldbe prepared to exercise the latter function.    In any case since it wouldmean the umpire laying down how Persia should run her oil industry it is clear that Dr. Musaddiq would never agree.    We have been clearlywarned of this both by Mr. Middleton and by the U.S. Ambassador atTehran.    I return to this point below.7. With regard to Dr. Musaddiq&apos;s second point, immediatefinancial assistance, it is not possible to us to meet this requestourselves.    Her Majesty1 s Government could only give money to Persiaas a loan secured on Persian oil and I assume that this is out of thequestion.    They might however make a virtue of necessity and relaxto some extent the present restrictions on exports to Persia and onPersia1 s use of sterling which are harming us almost as much as the persians.    A 1 i st of such &quot;concessions&quot; is given in Annex II,8. So far as the Company are concerned, they have admitted publicly that the sum of   1.3 millions remains to be paid on account of sums dueto the Persian Government in respect of 1951 under the 1933 ConcessionAgreement.    But this amount is a trifle compared with the losses whichthe Company have suffered as a result of nationalisation and her majesty&apos;s Government  could not advise the Company to release thisuncondi t i onal1y.
lit,9. The same applies to the  50 millions in the SpecialContingencies Fund to which Mr. Middleton refers in paragraph 5 of his-    telegram, more especially as this sum was only due to be paid under theSupplemental  Oil Agreement which Persia rejected.    It has in any casealready been appropriated.i)0. The only source therefore from which immediate financial aidis likely to come is the United States.    This would have disadvantagesfor us.    The United States would demand a much greater say in the oilnegotiations than at present and there would be less tendency to discourageAmerican oil companies from entering the field.    It might be said thatthe policies of the United States and the United Kingdom were again at variance.    However, it is quite certain that the United States will giveDr. Musaddiq dollars and we shall I suggest do better to concentrate on ensuring that only a small amount is given by them on termsacceptable to us rather than on trying to prevent aid being given at all.There is good reason to think that the United States will in fact be willing to restrict their aid in this manner.11. We now come to Dr.  Musaddiq&apos;s third point, arrangements for thefuture sales of oil.    This must be considered in the light of the &quot;FourPrinciples&quot; on which the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in regardto any settlement of the oil dispute have hitherto been based.    These are(1)    Adequate compensation to the A.I.O.C.  for the loss of itsinstallations and of the Concession.(2)    Assurance that  compensation will effectively be paid.(3)    No better terms for Persia than those enjoyed by any otherMiddle East  oil producing country.(4)    No discrimination against British nationals.12. On the terms of reference for arbitration acceptable to us(see paragraph 4 and 5 above)  there is little doubt that the first ofthese principles will be safeguarded .    There would, however, be noprior assurance that the compensation would be effectively paid.    Weshould depend for the safeguarding of our second principle on the satis-factory conclusion of the negotiations with the A.I.O. C. and upon thesanction of an award by the International  Court.    It is not to beexpected at this stage that Dr. Musaddiq will allow any foreignparticipation in the management of the Persian oil industry, which will accordingly remain inefficient and unreliable as a source of compensation;though it may well be that as he comes to understand that oil means moneyhe will be eager to increase efficiency in order to increase output.    Onthis basis the question of our fourth principle will not arise.13. It is with regard to the third principle that the greatestdifficulties will be encountered.    This is perhaps the most important of our principles and the one on which any compromise would be most dangerous to our oil investments and to the  Balance of Payments.    It ishard to believe that Dr.  Musaddiq would agree to a price or to a divisionof profits which would not leave him better off than other Middle Eastcountries.    It  could be argued that to offer the Persians more than a50 - 50 basis would not be abandoning this principle if we couldrepresent to the other Middle East countries that the value of such anarrangement was offset by the heavy compensation which Persia wouldhave to pay.
14. There will also be the question of payment for the stocksof oil now in the tanks at Abadan, which may fairly be said to bealready the property of the A.I.O.C.    It would be foolish to imagine that these negotiations will not be extremely difficult.    The company have, however,  indicated that they would be willing to enter into these negotiations provided that an arbitration were proceeding before theInternational Court on terms of reference which would not exclude anyof their claims.    They are not unhopeful that despite all the difficultiesthey might be able to come to some workable arrangement.    The company have stated that they would in no circumstances enter into an agreement which involved their giving better terms to Persia than those enjoyed by other oil producing countries.    Provided the Company follow this line(and it is manifestly in their interests to do so) our third Principlewill not be in jeopardy.    On the other hand,  as has so often happened in previous negotiations with Dr.  Musaddiq, these might well end in dead-1 stock.15. Incidentally, the Persian Oil Sales Commission would be amost unsuitable body with which to negotiate as it  consists of comparatively junior officials and would have no authority.Alternative Courses of Action16. If no action is taken the probable consequences will be -(i)    The United States will give Dr. Musaddiq financial aidwithout attaching conditions which would help towards an oil settlement.Such aid to a country so manifestly in the wrong would be a deplorableexample to those who might consider imitating Persia&apos;s conduct,(ii)    The &quot;blockade&quot; will  gradually break down,  certainly to alimited extent.    Small scale &quot;pirate&quot; operations will take place andthere is the possibility of the big companies under United StatesGovernment pressure ceasing to co-operate with the A.I.O. C.(iii)    The danger of Communism in Persia,  even though we do notrate this as highly as do the Americans, may not after all be averted.(iv)    There would be an end of Anglo-American co-operation in persia and a visible breach with possible repercussions far beyond that count ry.(v)    There would be an end of British influence in Persia for an indefinite period.17. A second course of action would be to agree to &quot;all claims and counter-claims&quot; being submitted to arbitration by the international court subject to the proviso that before this took place thenegotiations between the A.I.O. C. and Persia referred to fromparagraphs 11 to 15 above should have reached a satisfactory conclusion.Unless the United States were to make this a condition for their financial aid there would be no hope of inducing Dr.  Musaddiq to accept it since he regards his offer of arbitration by the International Courtas a substantial  concession in itself.    In the opinion of the ForeignOffice the United States would be most unlikely to insist on such acondition.
IS. A third course would be to authorise Mr. Middleton to try toreach agreement with Dr. Musaddiq on the following basis: -( i)    Arbi t rat i on on compensat i on by t he Int international i onal Court on terms of reference which would enable us to raise all our claims (para-graphs 4 and 5 above).(ii)    Explanation of the position of Her Majesty&apos;s Government andthe A.I.O. C.  in regard to financial assistance (paragraphs 7-above).(iix) Agreement that discussions should start at once between theA.I.O.C. and suitable representatives of the Persian Government withregard to sales of oil (paragraphs 11 - 15 above).19. Simultaneously with action as indicated in the preceding para-graph we should seek the full concurrence of the United States Governmentand in particular obtain their agreement to make financial aidconditional on Dr.  Musaddiq1 s acceptance of the proposition to be put to him by Mr. Middleton.20. In neither of the courses proposed in paragraphs 17-19would we recognise the validity of the Nine Point Nationalisation Lawuntil full compensation had been awarded.S, L,Foreign Office,  S.W.I.,19TH AUGUST,  1952.
