mSECRETC.(52)  286 COPY NOj19TH AUGUST, 1952CABINETPERSIANote hy the Secretary of theCabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister I circulate the following texts of telegrams exchanged between him and president  Truman.(Signed)      NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S.W.I.19th August, 1952MR. CHURCHILL TO MR. TRUMAN:   TELEGRAM3362 of 16TH AUGUST, 1952In Anthony&apos;s absence I am taking charge of the ForeignOffice correspondence.Iam concerned about the Alton Jones&apos; visit to Mussadiqafter his personal interview with you.      If it came about that american oil  interests were working to take our place in thePersian oil fields after we have been treated so ill there, this might well raise serious controversy in this country.      We are doing our utmost to bear the heavy load,  and do not possess thebi-partisan support of the Opposition, which we gave the late government  in foreign and defence affairs.      We are also helpingall we can in Korea.      No country is running voluntarily the risks which we are,  should atomic warfare be started by Soviet Russia.I hope you will do your best to prevent American help forMussadiq,  either governmental or commercial, ,  from becoming a powerful argument in the mouths of those who care little for thegreat  forward steps towards Anglo-American unity in the common cause which you and I have worked for so long.&apos; -nsr &apos;
MR. TRUMAN TO MR. CHURCHILL:    TELEGRAM1551 of 18TH AUGUST, 1952I have your message of 16th August and. understandyour concern over the Jones visit to Persia.      However,  Jonesimpressed me favourably and was emphatic about his desireto be helpful in facilitating a Brit i sh-Persian oil settlement.He seems to be sincere in his belief that  resumption oflarge-scale oil operations in Persia is impossible withoutthe co-operation of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and said he would emphasise this to Musaddiq.      As we told Sir OliverFranks,  Jones plans to talk to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Companypeople after seeing Musaddiq.      As we see it,  there are twoprobl ems:(1)   An agreement must be reached with the Fersianson the amount  of compensation due theAnglo-Iranian Oil Company;    and(2)   Means must be found to enable Persia to paythis sum out of oil revenues.I think there is a good chance Jones can be helpful on thesecond problem.       First  of all, he will again explain toMussadiq  the facts of life in the oil industry and the need of dealing with the Anglo-Iranian Oil  Company.      Secondly,  ifthe Ma-test; Persian proposals lead to an agreement with thecompany for the sale and distribution of Persian oil,  Jonesmay be able to help the Persian Government resume productionand refining processes so that there will be oil for theAnglo d rani an Oil Company to buy and market.If Jones can work out something it might be useful,since, with the political temper in Persia as it is,  I think there i s no possibility that  British management as such  wouldbe allowed to return and take charge of the oil fields orrefinery.      By the same token, no other foreign interests could take the   place in Persia which the Anglo-Iranian Oil Companyformerly held,  and I am certain the American oil companiesunderstand this.I need not tell you that we have not the slightest wis&apos;r;to profit by your present difficulties.      We will do everything possible to avoid even the appearance of this.On the wider issues,   I am hopeful that you will beable to take up Mussadiq&apos;s most  recent proposals in a broadand conciliatory spirit.      Our reports make me think there isno chance that this or any other Persian Government can come forward with anything better,  and the danger which would be involved in missing this opportunity seems to me too greatto be risked.      It  looks to me as if time is running out for us.In particular,  I hope you will be willing to acceptthe Persian nationalisation law.      I see no possibility of any agreement  if you include in the Court &apos; s terms of referenceany question of the validity of that law,  which seems to have become as sacred in Persian eyes as the Koran.      This need
not,  of course, prevent you,  during the arbitral proceedings,from maintaining the validity of the 1933 Concession andclaiming damages for its unilateral abrogation.      Deaa Achesonsent a message to Eden along this line on 12th August.      If Persiagoes down the communist drain,  it will be little satisfaction toany of us that legal positions were defended to the last.      the strategic consequences of the   loss of Persia to the West and thepossibility therein of gradually losing the great bulk of theMiddle East with its oil resources to the Soviets are tooobvious to mention.      Such a disaster to the free world would undoubtedly also place a strain on general Anglo-Americanrelat i enships not pleasant to contemplate.It is my earnest hope that we can avoid these misfortunesand move forward together in the common cause,      I think you know how much Anglo-American unity means to me.-3-
