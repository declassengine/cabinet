Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1952SECRETC. (52) 2765th August, 1952CABINETPERSIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsTehran telegrams Nos. 518 and 519 of 25th July reported Musaddiq&apos;s offer tonegotiate on compensation only, or alternatively to submit &quot; the dispute regardingthe Southern oil question &quot; to arbitration on a wide formula. This offer was tied toa request for financial assistance from the United Kingdom and was accompaniedby an expression of hope that, if the oil dispute was settled in the way he suggested,friendly relations could be restored between Persia and the United Kingdom.Musaddiq later withdrew this offer.2. In a subsequent interview with Musaddiq, Mr. Henderson, the UnitedStates Ambassador at Tehran, has formed the opinion that there is no chance of thePersian Government under Musaddiq making a settlement of the oil dispute except on the following lines:  (a) The Persian Government would operate the exploitation and extractionfacilities in Persia without any control whatsoever from abroad.(b) Persia would expect the British and American Governments and the inter-national oil companies to place no obstacles to prevent Persia employing,on an individual basis, the minimum number of foreign technicians whichPersia might consider necessary.(c) Persia would be willing to sell to A.I.O.C., or to a subsidiary, most of herproducts on a commercial basis. She would not be willing to sell theentire production to a single purchaser.(d) Persia would be prepared to submit the question of compensation to international arbitration.(e) Persia would pay to A.I.O.C. as compensation a certain percentage of herreceipts from sales, until the compensation has been fully paid.(/) On the conclusion of the agreement, A.I.O.C. would abandon all claims toreal and movable property in Persia.(g) United Kingdom and Persia would take appropriate steps to restorefriendship between the two countries.Mr. Henderson emphasised that these points were merely the Conclusions whichhe drew during his conversation; Musaddiq is in no way committed to them.3. In the light of Mr. Henderson&apos;s reports the State Department have proposed that Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government shouldjointly make the following offer to Musaddiq:  (i) The United States will make an immediate grant of $10 million to thePersian Government.(ii) The A.I.O.C. or some other agency designated by the British Governmentwill purchase from Persia all the oil products presently held in storageby the N.I.O.C. at the Commercial Persian Gulf prices less an appro-priate discount.(iii) On the basis of the proposal discussed between Dr. Musaddiq and theBritish Charge dAffaires in Tehran on 25th July, it would be agreedthat an arbitral commission consisting of three persons should be set42710 copy No. 7 0
up immediately to consider the question of compensation. Neither theAmerican grant of $10 million nor the start of British oil purchaseswould beheld up pending the commencement of the arbitral procedure.. (iv) Negotiations looking toward a more permanent arrangement for thedistribution of Persian oil should be undertaken promptly. If the- question should be raised regarding sale of oil in excess of that sold to the A.I.O.C., the Persians should be told that the Governments ofthe United States and the United Kingdom have agreed that noobstacles would be placed in the way of such sales.4. We have all along been working on four principles which must be safe-guarded in any settlement:  (i) There must be fair compensation for loss caused by nationalisation ofconcessionary rights and property, to be agreed between the two partiesor, in default, settled by arbitration.(ii) It is not enough when nationalisation occurs that there should be theacceptance of the principle of fair compensation; it is necessary, as mr. Harriman publicly stated last year, that there must be security for payment of effective compensation,(hi) Persia should not by reason of her unilateral action secure, overall, morefavourable terms than concessionary Governments which have respectedtheir contracts.(iv) Her Majesty&apos;s Government cannot negotiate on a basis of discriminationinvolving the exclusion of its own nationals.5. Before Musaddiq&apos;s resignation, Ministers had agreed that, in the eventof a more reasonable Government coming to power, we could contemplate asettlement on the basis of a Management Agency, if necessary including foreign aswell as British elements, combined with a long-term sales contract to the A.I.O.C.This agency would operate under a management contract with the National iranian oil Company. A number of variants of this proposed arrangement were under examination when Qavam resigned.6. Since the failure of the International Bank&apos;s mission, we have based our policy on the principle that Musaddiq would never subscribe to a settlement acceptable to us, and that no agreement at all was better than one which involveddeparture from the four fundamental principles set out in paragraph 4 above.We therefore waited for the replacement of Musaddiq by a more reasonableGovernment with which we could negotiate a satisfactory oil settlement and withwhich the former relations of confidence could be progressively established. the likelihood of such a Government arising is now remote. The return of any of theformer politicians outside the National Front can probably be ruled out. It wouldbe wiser to regard the choice as lying between Governments of the National Front,whose degree of fanaticism may vary within certain limits, and Governmentscontrolled by the Tudeh.7. Since his return to office, Musaddiq&apos;s position has changed. In some respects he is stronger than he has ever been. He has weakened the Shah&apos;s positionand can expect to encounter no opposition from that quarter. He has discreditedthe Army and victimised its leaders, with the result that it can no longer be countedupon to preserve order. He will, however, be embarrassed by the demands of theTudeh Party who helped him back to office, and by the continuing pressure of thecountry&apos;s economic and financial plight. He now appears to understand howdesperate is Persia&apos;s economic state when no revenues are received from oil, and hehas asked informally for assistance from the United Kingdom. He has not askedfor American aid, but has complained bitterly that the United States Governmenthave not offered it to him. It is unlikely that he could be replaced as Prime minister in the immediate future, except by the Tudeh, and he therefore represents the bestdefence though not a strong one against communism in Persia.8. The crucial question now is: Do we still adhere to the view that we cannot make a satisfactory agreement with Musaddiq and that we therefore should do nothing, or do we insist on at least exploring the possibility of securing an accept-able arrangement by means of the only kind of negotiations which it appearsMusaddiq will now contemplate?
9.   The first is a policy of, simple negation.   Its probable consequences would(a) Continuing or progressively deteriorating bad relations with Persia.(b) The gradual collapse of the oil &quot;blockade.&quot;   (It is.estimated that Persiamight in due course find markets, despite the embargo by the majormarketing companies, for 2-5 million tons of crude oil in Europe and1-5 million tons of.crude oil in Latin America.)(c) Loss of our traditional markets and damage to our trading positiongenerally.(d) Friction with other Governments.   The United States Government mayaccuse us of abandoning Persia to communism, while other Govern-ments will resent our attempts to enforce the &quot; blockade.&quot;10. As regards the alternative, it is clear from Mr. Henderson&apos;s and Mr.Middleton&apos;s reports that Musaddiq&apos;s conception of the scope of negotiations is strictly limited to compensation. He has already withdrawn his offer of arbitration,presumably because he or his advisers thought it was dangerously wide. BothMr. Middleton and Mr. Henderson seem to think, however, that he could be per-persuaded to revive his interest in arbitration, though he would no doubt try to place the following limits on its scope :(a) Compensation only.He has at Various times suggested that the basis on which compensation should be settled should be either:  (i) the value of the Company&apos;s shares before nationalisation;(ii) any Nationalisation Law passed elsewhere which is acceptable tothe Company.Neither would be acceptable to us, since they do not take into account the Company&apos;s loss of future benefits under the 1933 concession(damages).(b) No mention of the 1933 concession.(c) No questioning of the validity of the Persian Nationalisation Laws.In other respects, he might wish to see the terms of reference of the arbitration drawnwidely in order that he could introduce such matters as Persian counter-claims onthe Company and the conditions of sale of oil to the Company in future.11. Arbitration on the question of compensation pure and simple is notadequate from the Anglo-Iranian Company&apos;s point of view, since it would not allow them to raise the validity of the Persian Nationalisation Law or its compati-bility with the Anglo-Persian Company&apos;s concession. On the other hand, it is clearthat Musaddiq will not agree to arbitrate this question as such, or to any terms ofreference which would include a mention of the concession. In these circumstances the only possibility would be to try to put up terms which would have the effect of enabling the Company to raise what they want without being liable to rejection byMusaddiq. This is not easy, but something on the following lines might be tried:  &quot; Arbitration should be on the basis of deciding:  (1) What sums are due to the Company from the Persian Government inrespect of the nationalisation of the Company&apos;s undertaking, havingregard to (a) the date and manner of the nationalisation;(b) the legal situation existing between the Persian Government andthe Company immediately previous to the Nationalisation;(c) the value of the Company&apos;s undertaking, the installations involved,its goodwill and prospects of future earnings, together with&apos;theloss and damage caused to Jdie Company by the Persian. action; /(2) the. time and method of payment and the means of making paymenteffectual;(3) the arrangements for the future conduct of the oil industry pending fulland final payment to the Company of the compensation and other sumsawarded under (1).&quot;This formula would, of course, be capable of modification and of beingrendered to some extent less precise and comprehensive.   But something of the42710 b&quot;2be; 
kind seems to represent the ieast which would; enable the Company to raise theissue of the essential validity of the Persian action.12. A.I.O.C., with.our concurrence, have applied to the President of theInternational Court for the appointment of a sole arbitrator under Article 22 id)of the 1933 Concession Agreement. It is not certain that the President will agree,but he may well do so. If Her Majesty\s Government accepted a different pro-cedure of arbitration with the Persian Government the two arbitral procedurescould not go on simultaneously. The Company would have, to be asked to staytheir procedure once inter-governmental arbitration had been arranged, and sincethe outcome of governmental arbitration would settle the dispute, the company would, in theory, have been deprived of a remedy under the 1933 ConcessionAgreement. A.I.O.C. are obviously entitled to pursue all the legal remedies opento them, but this particular one is unlikely to be of much use since an award inA.I.O.C.&apos;s favour by an arbitration of the International Court would not be acceptedby a Persian Government.13. Mr. Acheson&apos;s plan, decribed in paragraph 3 above, provides for arbitra-tion on the question of compensation by a commission of three persons, but it isclearly unacceptable as it stands id) It virtually enables Musaddiq to receive United States aid unconditionally.(b) It requires the Company to purchase its own oil before an agreement toarbitrate is reached.(c) It fails to relate the interim remedy of lifting existing stocks to a more permanent arrangement.(d) It requires us to tell Musaddiq, apparently before he enters into any agreement, that we will not prevent him from selling oil to otherpurchasers than the A.I.O.C., thus in fact abandoning our right tomaintain the blockade.14.   There are two replies which could be sent to Mr. Acheson:  id) We could reject his suggestions entirely and express the hope that theUnited States Government will not themselves proceed with the sugges-tion of financial aid.(b) We could accept his suggestion for a joint approach provided that he agreedto the following modifications of his plan:  ii) Financial aid would be conditional upon the agreement of thePersian Government to arbitration on acceptable terms and to suitable arrangements for the lifting of stocks of oil.(ii) Purchases of oil by the A.I.O.C. would not be made until the termsof reference of the arbitration had been agreed upon,(ii) The A.I.O.C. would not be asked to abandon the right to take legal action against other purchasers of Persian oil. In addition wecould offer to relax progressively some of the restrictions whichwe are at present placing on exports to Persia and on the useof Persian sterling. Some of these are already hurting us morethan the Persians.15. It is most unlikely that Mr. Acheson would agree to abandon his planentirely, and id) is therefore an ineffective answer. Persian intransigence wouldbe increased by an offer of United States aid which was not made conditional uponsome approach to a settlement of the oil dispute, and in such a case we shouldhave to recognise that in practice any serious hope of an agreement and of savinganything of our investment in Persia would have to be abandoned.16. On the other hand, the Persian Government are obviously more likely toagree to arbitration on terms which we could accept, if United States aid is dependentupon their agreement. Mr. Acheson proposes that a commission of threearbitrators shall decide the question of compensation. We could accept such a procedure provided we were able to secure acceptance of a formula similar tothat mentioned in paragraph 11, which we should explain to Mr. Acheson. Wecannot expect Musaddiq to agree to arbitration on any wider basis for the reasons give in paragraph 10, but he might have difficulty in refusing arbitration onthis ba,sis, especially if in doing so he also deprived himself of American assistance.
17. As regards interim arrangements for the movement of Persian oil, theChairman of the A.I.O.C. has said that, if the Government indicated that a proposal on the foregoing lines was desirable on political grounds and if his Board agreed,his company would be ready to endeavour to get some Persian oil moving. Buthe has pointed out that for a number of reasons this could not be arranged quickly and two or three months might elapse before movement could start. The company would also need to be assured that its position was protected under the proposalsfor arbitration. I suggest that a formal approach would have to be made to thecompany by Her Majesty&apos;s Government on these points.18. I do not put very high the prospects of a successful issue to this courseof action. Mr. Acheson and the State Department, in their anxiety to ward offCommunism in Persia, have long desired to assist Musaddiq at the expense of therights and interests of the A.I.O.C. and of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand have only been restrained with difficulty, while Musaddiq has, formally,never moved from his original position. He has not committed himself to paper for nearly a year. In the changed circumstances in Persia, the State department will be even harder to restrain, and they are not likely to hold firmly to what weshould regard as a necessary basis for arbitration. There are clear indications thatthe State Department are prepared to support Musaddiq in any circumstances andare disposed to criticise us for alleged willingness to allow Persia to go Communistrather than make an. unsatisfactory oil agreement. Nevertheless, I think we must make the attempt to maintain a common front with Washington. A parting ofthe ways between the Americans and ourselves in Persia might well mean the endof our influence in that country for a long period and have serious repercussionselsewhere. It is generally thought that an agreement with Musaddiq whichdeparted in any way from the four principles enunciated in paragraph 4 above would be worse than no agreement at all in view of the effect on British investmentsin other parts of the world. But there could hardly be a worse blow to Britishinterests than the example of a country which, after finally and successfully expropriating-priating a British interest in breach of its constitutional obligations, is rewardedby American aid.19.  I therefore recommend: id) that Her Majesty&apos;s Government, with the agreement of the A.I.O.C., shouldbe prepared to enter into arbitration proceedings with the PersianGovernment provided that acceptable terms of reference can be found.(b) that, on this basis, A.I.O.C. should be asked to endeavour to arrange forthe movement of oil from Persia as soon as agreement on arbitration isreached.id) that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should be prepared, as circumstancesrequire, to relax some of the restrictions which are at present imposed on trade with Persia.id) that Mr. Acheson should be informed of the conditions on which her majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to join with the United StatesGovernment in making a joint approach to Dr. Musaddiq&apos;s Government.A.
