THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1952Copy No:8 1CABINETOVERSEAS INFORMATION services memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recall that, in the debate on Overseas Information services which took place in the House of Commons on 2nd April, the Joint parliamentary under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office and the Financial Secretary to theTreasury announced that a Committee of Officials would be appointed to considerthe whole range of Overseas Information Services from the political and strategicaspects. This Committee has now finished its work, and I circulate herewith itsreport.2. The report provides a comprehensive review of the aims, methods and organisation of Overseas Information work, and I believe the Secretaries of Statefor Commonwealth Relations and the Colonies share my general agreement withits assessment of the very great importance of this work in our present political and strategic position. As the Official Committee itself recognises, the effectiveness ofInformation work overseas cannot be measured with any degree of exactness.Those of us who are primarily concerned with it are, however, convinced of-its importance as an instrument of policy, and our view is amply borne out by our representatives overseas, who have been consulted in the course of the Enquiry. invite my colleagues&apos; particular attention to paragraph 35 of the report, which sets out the grounds for believing that our overseas publicity has played a very sub-stantial part in the manifest weakening of Communist influence in Western Europeduring the last few years.3. The Committee makes only one positive recommendation, which is thatthe so-called &quot;common ceiling&quot; for overseas information expenditure should be abolished. The reasons for this recommendation are set out in paragraphs 27 to 29of the Report, and I endorse them. If the common ceiling were abolished, each department responsible for information work overseas Would be responsible forjustifying its own estimates to the Treasury, and would be enabled to proposeincreases or decreases in information expenditure within its total estimates, insteadof being bound, in respect of this part of its expenditure, by,an arbitrary ceilingcovering other Departments and Agencies. For the reasons sketched in para-graph 28 of the Report, this common ceiling makes it harder every year to run theForeign Service properly as a single whole. In this respect the work of the ForeignOffice suffers a special inconvenience since a very high proportion of the ForeignOffice&apos;s direct expenditure on Information has to be spent on maintaining staffabroad. ^4. Apart from this recommendation, it is implicit throughout the Committee&apos;sReport that the funds at present devoted to overseas information, reduced as theyhave been in each of the last six years, are no longer adequate to permit this workto play its full part in the successful execution of our foreign and Commonwealthpolicies. The Committee recognise, of course, that funds for information work,as for everything else, depend on the country&apos;s economic and financial situation.To agree that more funds ought to be provided is not to say that other expenditure should be cut in order to make this possible; the problem is clearly to determine theright priorities.   This is more than ordinarily difficult in the case of activities such42625SECRET CABINET OFFIChC. (52) 259 RECORD COPY24th July, 1952
Foreign Office, S.W. 1,24th July, 1952.as overseas information where, as explained in paragraph 32 of the Report, the precise benefits obtained cannot be measured or have a money value put upon them.5. Since the Committee did not feel competent to examine the question of priorities, it confined itself to suggesting (paragraph 37) that the international situation demands &quot; an intensification of Overseas Information work and a measureOf continuity in its financing in order to permit operations to be so planned as.toproduce their full cumulative effect.&quot;6. I do not imagine that my colleagues would feel able to decide upon suchan expansion of overseas information work in present conditions of financial stringency unless they were satisfied that the work now being done was in factproducing the results claimed for it, that it was being efficiently and economicallycarried out, and that the present distribution of resources, by areas and by methods,was broadly correct. Some members of the Committee thought that to this endit would be useful to Her Majesty&apos;s Government, and reassuring to Parliament andpublic opinion, if a very small body of independent persons were appointed toexamine the whole structure pf the various Overseas Information Services, and visita number of representative countries overseas in order to form a judgment on the spot of their effectiveness; and then to report to Her Majesty&apos;s Government on thevalue of the Overseas Services as an instrument Of policy and On the presentdistribution of. funds as between areas and methods. Others thought, however,that it would be difficult to find persons of the requisite calibre who would beprepared to devote sufficient time to such an enquiry and that in any case theywould not be likely to offer a sounder judgment on the complicated problems involved than the officials who are concerned with information and Her Majesty&apos;representatives overseas whose opinions are already known. Accordingly, theCommittee did not offer any recommendation on this point.7, I myself, however, believe that such an enquiry would be valuable.From the Parliamentary point of view, there is much to be said for this suggestion,and without underestimating in any way the value of the opinions expressed by officials, I believe that only an independent enquiry such as this can provide the foundation for a properly balanced and settled policy for Overseas information and so reduce, if not obviate, the fluctuations which have done so much in recentyears to decrease its.effectiveness,, .8. If my colleagues approve in principle the suggestion for an independent enquiry I suggest that the selection of persons for it, its precise terms of reference,and the various administrative details involved might be left to me to settle inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretaries of State for commonwealth Relations and the Colonies and the President of the Board ofTrade.
, TIBTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTSECRET Copy No. J 53THE OVERSEAS INFORMATION SERVICESReport by Committee of EnquiryAims of the EnquiryOur terms of reference were set out in statements made by the parliamentary under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office and the Financial Secretary to theTreasury in the course of the debate on the Information Services which took placein the House of Commons on 2nd April, 1952. Mr. Nutting said, in the course ofhis speech:  &quot; Each successive year the overseas information services have been sub-jected to the over-riding requirements of finance. &apos; What can we afford? &apos; hasbeen the standard by which they have been judged rather than &apos; How much is it politically essential we should do? &apos; It is high time, in my view, that an enquiry was made into the political aspects of this field. We have, therefore,already taken steps to invite the departments concerned, together with theB.B.C. and the British Council, to consider the whole range of our overseas information services from the political and strategic aspects.&quot;In winding up the debate the Financial Secretary to the Treasury added:  &quot; I have my Hon. Friend&apos;s authority to add the fact that those discussionswill take place, in the first instance, on the official level between the ForeignOffice, Commonwealth Relations and Colonial Offices, the Ministry of defence and the Board of Trade, together with the B.B.C. and the British Council, witha view, of course, to further stages being considered by Ministers.&quot;Accordingly, the object of the enquiry has &quot;been to examine Overseas information interms of functions, organisation and political aims rather than from the point ofview of financial requirements and limitations.2. In this report &quot; information &quot; is used to describe the services referred toin the annual White Paper on the Government Information Services, which for financial purposes are grouped under the so-called &quot; information ceiling.&quot; It is used, therefore, in an extremely wide sense, since the operations under the ceilingare extremely diverse. They range from overseas broadcasting by the british broadcasting Corporation to the work of Foreign Office and Commonwealth Rela-tions Office information officers overseas and, on the educational and cultural side,they include such diverse activities as the British CounciFs contribution to theexecution of the United Nations technical assistance programmes and the ColomboPlan, almost all United Kingdom educational expenditure abroad and the welfare of foreign students in the United Kingdom (though not Colonial students, who arenot treated as &quot; information &quot;). The operations under the &quot; ceiling &quot; are thusscarcely homogeneous, and, although the aims mentioned below apply in a generalway to most of them, many other motives come into play. In the same way, even ifthe main results are political, there are also various by-products such as the econo-mic benefits of training large numbers of overseas scientists and technicians in theUnited Kingdom and the use of British scientific and technical books abroad.The Aims of the Overseas Information services . Government Information Services are a comparatively recent innovation,and there is perhaps a tendency to regard them not only as a development ofcommercial publicity on a national scale but as serving the same sort of purpose,namely, to convince the listener or reader of the excellence of the product adver-used. There are, of course, similarities which are more than accidental; but thereal genesis of Government information work lies in the increased influence nowexerted by public opinion upon the policies of Governments.and in the developmentof modern techniques for the mass dissemination of news and views.   Even in a
v17] cworld at peace and free from serious international rivalries no policy would belikely to-day to obtain international acceptance, unless it was understood and accepted by peoples as well as by Governments; and in a world which is rent byprofound ideological differences the state of public opinion determines public policy to an ever-increasing extent. Governments must not only carry their own public opinion with them but use public opinion overseas to influence other foreign government. In seeking to make use of public opinion overseas competition isencountered from yet other Governments Who are also seeking to influence thispublic opinion. The object of our overseas information work is thus not primarily to build up the prestige of this country (though this may be one of the methodsused) but rather to create in overseas countries an intellectual or emotionalatmosphere in which the policies advocated by Her Majesty&apos;s Government are more likely to be accepted than opposed. Where -contrary policies are advocated byother Powers, it is the aim of overseas information work to prevent their accept-ance; but this negative task cannot as a rule be carried out effectively by itself.Positive information work, designed to promote acceptance of British policies, is thus just as essential to the prosecution of the &quot; cold war &quot; as, say, the exposure of communist manoeuvres and intrigues.4. It follows that overseas information work is not an end in itself. It is a means of prosecuting the aims of British foreign, colonial and Commonwealthpolicy as a whole. As such it cannot be considered in isolation from the other instruments with which national policy can be made effective. The maintenanceof adequate armed forces is one such means; in peacetime, to the extent that their existence is made known, they promote stability and deter aggression; and in war-time they become the principal agency for &quot; the prosecution of policy by other means.&quot; They represent, in the last analysis, the ability to defend vital national interests by force. The commercial and financial resources of this country are alsomeans with which policy can be pursued, not by force, but by application to theeconomic and commercial requirements of other countries. The overseas infor-mation services represent a third instrument of policy which enhances the effective-ness of the other two and in addition operates directly on the minds of peoples and their leaders; and it is one which acquires increasing importance for thiscountry and its allies as the Soviet Government increasingly abandons the conven-tional methods of diplomacy in favour of strong-arm tactics and subversivepropaganda, while they themselves are obliged by international undertakings andthe force&apos;of public opinion to solve disputes by fair means.5. The subject-matter of overseas information work is thus unlimited. Itsraw material is every asset military, economic, cultural and spiritual of thiscountry. The greater the tangible assets the more easily they can be brought tobear on the foreign consciousness, and the more restricted they are, the greater the&quot; information &quot; effort required. If the work is done effectively, the aims of policy are secured in advance. If it fails, policy can ultimately achieve its objects only by the use of the nation&apos;s tangible assets; economically by expenditure of money and goods or even militarily by expenditure of men and material. It is the aim of overseas information work to make the expenditure of these assets unnecessary politically by securing maximum acceptance for British policies in friendly countries and strategically by counteracting the influence of hostile policies in countries notsecurely aligned with us or by weakening the hold of hostile Governments over their own peoples. The application of these guiding principles to particular areasOr countries is briefly considered in the following paragraphs.6. The current aims of the Foreign Office in information work directed to various areas can be summarised as follows:  (a) The USA.To maintain and enhance the United States public&apos;s confidence in thevalue of the United Kingdom as its best ally in the &quot; cold war.&quot;(b) The Soviet Orbit and ChinaTo maintain the faith of non-Communists in Western democracy, idealsand policies (short of arousing hopes of early liberation) and to sow doubtsof ultimate success at home or abroad in Communist minds.
(c) Western europe to maintain and enhance the popular will to resist communism, acceptthe cost of rearmament and trust in the determination and capacity of theUnited Kingdom and United States to defend Europe.        . &quot;Special Cases(i) Germany.-To deny German man-power and industrial potential tothe Soviet Union and maintain and develop the sense thatGermany&apos;s future lies in co-operation with Western Europe bothin peace and for defence.(ii) Yugoslavia. To maintain and develop the growing rapprochementof Yugoslavia with the Western democracies (short of explicitlyapproving its Communist features) both for its own strategic importance and in the hope of eventually detaching other Satellites&quot;from the Soviet Orbit.(d) Middle east to offset the current wave of xenophobia by arousing a sense of respon-sibility in the face of strategic realities and to reinforce this by encouragingreform and economic development as a means to social stability.(e) Far east to maintain and develop each country&apos;s independence, social development and economic progress, with a view to increasing the desire and ability of thewhole area to resist communism from within and without.(f) Latin america to maintain the whole area&apos;s awareness of the United Kingdom as a source, alternative to the United States, of ideas in technical and socialprogress, a source of supply for essential goods and a market for their exports;and to help secure the area against Communist interference with its strategic exports.7. The current aims of the Commonwealth Relations Office in information work in the self-governing countries of the Commonwealth can be briefly sum-marised as follows: -(a) canada the forces of geography favour the growth of United States influence inCanada in every field. Economically, strategically and culturally, the twocountries are closely tied; the Canadian press, radio and television aredominated or inspired by the United States. The United Kingdom information services present United Kingdom and Commonwealth developments whichwould otherwise go unheard and thus help to prevent Canada falling entirelyunder United States influence.(b) Australia and New,ZealandThese two countries are closely linked with the United Kingdom and liketo be regarded as British. The aim of the information services is to ensure thatthis spirit continues, particularly among the coming generation which it maynot do unless fostered and to ensure that the image of Britain in the minds of Australians and New Zealanders is up to date.(c) South africa the principles of political life accepted as fundamental in other parts ofthe Commonwealth are under challenge in South Africa. The aim of our information work is to encourage that section of the population which looksto Britain for its standards of political conduct.(d) India, Pakistan and Ceylon. To keep before the opinion-forming classes the facts of the United King-dom case in international affairs; to show the advantages of Westerndemocracy and membership of the Commonwealth and in all ways to counter
the mass of Soviet and Chinese propaganda. In Ceylon, the United kingdom has special economic and strategic ties which it is important should continue,and the people of Ceylon must be convinced that their own freedom and thesuccess of the United Kingdom march together.8. The attachment of the Colonial Dependencies to the British connectioncannot be taken for granted. World opinion regarding the Colonial relationshipis a matter of moment for Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Nations andin international relations generally. The paramount objects of overseas information work in relation to the Colonies are twofold: first, as political control from london is loosened by constitutional advance, to strengthen the bonds of sentiment andenlightened self-interest between the Colonies, Great Britain and the rest of theCommonwealth, and, secondly, to present British Colonial policy, achievement and world importance to the world. In addition, at present, there is need to counterCommunist machinations, mainly by emphasising the democratic alternative but inpart also by judicious direct counter-propaganda. The second of the two para-mount objects is departmentally a matter for the Foreign Office and the Common-wealth Relations Office; but the two cannot be entirely separated. Relations withthe Colonies are increasingly affected by what the world thinks and says of them,and world opinion is much influenced by what it is told of the way in whichColonial policy is working out and by evidence of the attitude of Colonial peoplesto Great Britain. The information effort directed towards the Colonies emphasises the tradition of loyalty to the Sovereign, displays the economic, technical andmilitary achievements and potential of Great Britain, demonstrates the ways inwhich Britain is helping the Colonies to achieve the political and economic develop-ment which they desire, uses British example to inform those who seek knowledgeon political and administrative matters, seeks to ensure that Colonial culturaldevelopments take place in an atmosphere of British sympathy, understanding and help and seeks to break down racial and social barriers as much between differentColonial communities as between European and non-European. The state ofpolitical and educational development of many of the Colonies is such that british propaganda is most readily assimilated if it is combined with political education in the broadest sense. Different regions call for different emphases. Much use ismade of anti-Communist material in South-East Asia and Cyprus. In East africa the approach is akin to the educational: in West Africa political information, workon race relations, and information showing that West African achievements are taken notice of abroad are of particular value. In the West Indies the british connection is of long standing, but qualified by the impact and the prestige of theUnited States, the real or imagined hardships resulting from the need to conservehard currencies and industrious sapping by emissaries of Canadian commerce. the major requirements of the West Indies, therefore, are &quot; prestige &quot; and economicmaterial.9. In the. commercial field in all these countries the information services areactive with the following general aims:  (a) To increase knowledge and understanding of Britain&apos;s economic.and commercial policy and promote a disposition to co-operate with it;(b) To publicise individual British products and classes of products, so as to stimulate demand for-them.(c) To increase knowledge and appreciation of British economic, scientific and cultural achievements in the belief that prestige in such field will increase the demand for British goods.In this way they are reinforcing Britain&apos;s effort to place her balance of payments ona secure footing, just as in the &quot; cold war &quot; they are reinforcing the,defence effort.Methods of the Overseas Information Services10. The present methods of the overseas information services are set outin detail in the paper attached at Annex I. They can be summarised as follows.11. Information work can, in the first place, be divided generally into long-term and short-term operations. Of these, the first are the more complex and themore important, since the second depend upon them for full effect. The aim of long-term operations is, generally, to secure in men&apos;s minds a basic acceptance of
TIFwhat the United Kingdom stands for in the world and an understanding of Britishachievements and assets; in general, to inculcate a state of mind instinctively favour-able to rather than critical of, British actions and policies and a preparedness togive a hearing to the British point of view on any controversial topic which may arise. The media of long-term operations include most of the work of the british council and much of the output of the External Services of the British broadcasting corporation. The long-term operations are also carried-on by the information services of the overseas departments by the media of films, of lecture tours, ofsponsored visits to the United Kingdom by persons of influence, by the provision to such persons of written material both for reproduction in the Dress and forgeneral guidance, by the maximum amount of contact, both formal and informal,,between information staff &quot; in the field &quot; and leaders of opinion and by the pro-vision of reference libraries and reading rooms for the general public. In most countries the demand for these services now outstrips the supply. These long-termoperations must be continuous and stable. They will then have a cumulative effect,but will suffer disproportionately if interrupted.12. Short-term information work, of a topical nature and designed to furtherBritish policy on a particular subject at a particular juncture, can only bear fruit.when the ground has been prepared by a long-term information programme on thelines described above. The means for this purpose are the external services (inparticular news bulletins and news commentaries) of the British broadcasting corporation, the dissemination of statements such as those of Ministers in Parlia-ment or editorials in the British press, the provision of topical material,appropriately adapted to local taste, to local publicists and the dissemination ofauthoritative statements favourable to this country by politicians or publicists inthird countries. But for operations such as these to be effective the long-terminformation programme must have ensured, for example, that the public in thecountry concerned will habitually tune in to the British Broadcasting corporation and that the material supplied will be in demand and thus appear in the local press in short, that the overseas public will want to know what Britain has to say.13. In addition to the distinctions between long-term and short-term informa-tion work, a further differentiation has to be made between overt publicity, i.e., thedistribution of information and publicity material of which the official origin isplainly stated, and publicity of an indirect kind where the facts and views whichwe wish to disseminate reach the public without attribution to official or evenBritish sources. Preference for one method-over another depends largely on itssuitability for the country which is the &quot; target,&quot; and to some extent on the natureof the message which it is desired to convey. Thus &quot; negative &quot; as distinct from&quot;positive &quot; information work, i.e., the disruption of hostile propaganda campaigns(such as those of the Cominform), as distinct from the propagation of the Britishview, is often best achieved by indirect means. It is important to note, however,that anti-Communist work is greatly facilitated when a well-established informationsource or centre is already presenting the democratic alternative to communism.Organisation of the Overseas Information Services14. As described in Annex I in more detail, the present overseas informationorganisation consists, broadly speaking, of the Information Departments of theForeign Office, the Commonwealth Relations Office, the Colonial Office and theBoard of Trade; the Information Offices of Her Majesty&apos;s Missions and UnitedKingdom High Commissioners overseas; the Central Office of Information (which provides common services for the overseas departments); the External Services ofthe British Broadcasting Corporation; and the British Council and its representa-tives abroad. There is day-to-day co-operation between these elements on avworking level and an official committee on information exists to provide co-ordina-tion at a somewhat higher level. The Overseas Information Services (Ministerial)Committee, to which the latter reported, was dissolved last October and has notbeen replaced.15. It is sometimes urged that some form of closer association, if not, indeed,central direction, is necessary if our overseas information activities are to produce the maximum results. Although it is not strictly within our terms of reference!to offer recommendations on this point, we have given it some thought, because it would clearly be wrong to dismiss any suggestions which might increase the effectiveness of our overseas information services from the political and strategic
aspects. We believe that the view quoted above is based on the belief that overseas information, whether directed at foreign countries, the Commonwealth or theColonies, is essentially one operation and that it suffers from divided control whichcould be remedied by some relatively simple administrative change. It is true,of course, that overseas information work is a single operation in the sense that its object, whether in a Commonwealth country, a foreign country or a Colony, isto facilitate the execution of Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ policy in the interestsof this country. It is also true that information work in a particular country,whether it is conducted by an information officer, the British Broadcasting Corpora-tion or the British Council, is from the national standpoint essentially oneoperation. But we do not believe that the proposition is true in any other sensethan these two. The purposes of the Foreign Office, the Commonwealth relations office and the Colonial Office in their overseas information work are different,because their targets are different and because the methods they must employ are different. This does not mean, of course, that they can function efficiently oreconomically in isolation; themes must be consistent with each other whatever the target to which they are addressed, and much material must in the interestsof economy be used both for Commonwealth countries and foreign countries.Co-operation between the three overseas departments is therefore obviously neces-sary, and so of course is co-operation between the instruments which serve oneor other of them in any particular area or country. We believe, however, that adequate means of co-ordination already exist. Accordingly, we do not recom-mend any new form of organisation or any change in the present system underwhich the Ministers in charge of the overseas departments are individually respon-sible to Parliament for their information activities overseas. Certain proposals,however, which have emerged from our discussions for improving the machineryof co-ordination will be examined by the Overseas Information Services (Official)Committee.Foreign Information Activity16. Most countries, and certainly all major ones, to-day engage in overseas information work or propaganda. The chief protagonists in the &quot; cold war,&quot; theSoviet Union and the United States, are as might be expected, the leaders in this field, devoting to it resources, financial and material, far exceeding those whichwe could hope to deploy. The French are also active, though they traditionallyconcentrate on cultural and educational work. The efforts of other and smallerPowers are by no means negligible. In the following six countries, for example,Egypt, Argentina, Siam, France, Sweden and Austria, there is a total of 374 home-based information officers at work. Of these 156 are Americans (of whom, however,a certain proportion are engaged in cultural work, comparable to that of theBritish Council), 85 are information officers of the Soviet Union or satellite States,15 are British and 118 are from other countries. In terms of percentage of thetotal the figures are 42 per cent. American, 23 per cent. Soviet and satellite,4 per cent. British, all others 31 per cent. In 1945 twelve major countries were engaged in overseas broadcasting with programmes totalling 2,158 hours, ofwhich the British Broadcasting Corporation accounted for 32 per cent.; in 1951thirteen countries achieved a total of 3,351 hours, of which the British Broad-casting Corporation accounted for 17 per cent.; the decline of the british broadcasting Corporation in relation to the United States and Russia and the satellites is shown graphically in Annex II. In terms of transmitter hours,which provide a more accurate measure of effectiveness, the British broadcasting corporation total fell from 3,164 a week in 1947 to 2,212 a week in 1951.Comparable figures for the United States and Soviet external services, whichhave greatly increased, are unfortunately not available.17. In terms of the &quot;cold war&quot; the efforts of the smaller countries aresignificant only in the aggregate; but in terms of particular issues of policy a smallcountry can as the Persian and Egyptian crises showed make such unscrupuloususe of propaganda that, unless it is successfully countered, world opinion and,therefore, the policies of otherwise friendly Governments may be influenced toour detriment.18. So far as the Soviet Union is concerned, propaganda is beyond doubt theprincipal weapon of foreign policy and is systematically used to prepare the ground for policy decisions. Much of it is, of course, channelled through outlets of a kind not available to us namely local Communist parties under Moscow direction;

These are the headings shown in the annual White Paper. Expenditure by theCentral Office of Information and Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office is shown underthe expenditure of the departments to which their services are rendered.22. In assessing the significance of the above figures allowance must be madefor the fact that costs have steadily risen, so that the effective reduction of activitybut even in the sphere of conventional information methods (printed material,foreign language broadcasts, cultural activities and so forth) the Soviet effort is ona gigantic scale. Figures can be quoted only in respect of broadcasting to foreigncountries, where Soviet (U.S.S.R. and satellites) output rose from.425 programmehours per week in 1947) (against the British Broadcasting Corporation^ 623) to1,013 hours per week in 1951 (against the British Broadcasting Corporation^ 565).19. The United States information effort can be more accurately measured,since it is known that total expenditure on it rose from about  4 million in 1947to  28 million in 1951, not counting the vast amounts expended on cultural activitiesunder the Fulbright and Smith-Mundt Acts; that the annual expenditure of theVoice of America is some  8 million, with about  60 million available for capital investment; and that Voice of America&apos;s foreign broadcast output now amountsto 739 hours per week compared with 224 in 1947. The United States give about ,000 scholarships in comparison with 406 given by the British Council and 1,200by the French.20. To a substantial extent the United States effort is, of course, comple-mentary to our own, but it is impossible to accept the argument sometimes heard that the near-identity of our aims would enable us to reduce our own effort without serious ill-effect. For example, though our political aims and theirs are often thesame or similar, they are not always so; and the methods which we think bestadapted to the achievement of the aims we have in common are frequently very different from those advocated by the United States Government. Again, despite their vastly greater resources, the United States have so far proved less successfulthan we have in furthering the aims of Western policy by information techniques.Even, therefore, if purely national considerations (such as Commonwealth obliga-tions and export promotion) could be disregarded, we could not afford to leave thefield to a greater extent than at present to the United States and abandon the meansof promoting the specific British viewpoint.Finance ;&apos;21. The recent financial history of the overseas information services is one ofa progressive diminution of the amount voted for these activities, viz:   Million1948-49      .  ...      ............     .11-741949-50 ...      .............     11-041950-51 .....       .........      10-821951-52............      ...      10-281952^53 ...      ..........,.       9-79During the last three years these total sums have been divided as follows betweenthe various votes and grants-in-aid comprised under the overseas information&quot;ceiling&quot;:-1950-51 1951-52 1952-53Per Cent.   Per Cent. Per Cent.
in terms of work is much greater than the figures show. The following examplesillustrate this point:  (a) The emoluments of an Information Officer (Administrative Grade) in new york, amounting to  2,750 in 1947, have had to be increased to  4,075in 1952 to meet the increase in the cost of living and the devaluation of sterling; in Paris the emoluments of an Information Officer of theExecutive Grade have risen from  1,700 to  2,660 in the same period.(b) The printing costs of the Central Office of Information have increased asfollows:  taking 1947 as 100, the figure for printing in 1952 is 133, whilethe cost of paper stands at 225 per cent, of its cost in 1947.(c) The average global cost of one hour of programmes in the External Servicesof the British Broadcasting Corporation rose from  106-7 in 1947-48 to 148-3 (estimated) for the year 1952, an increase of 39 per cent. in only three years, namely from 1st January, 1949, to the same date in1952 the average running cost (excluding staff and overheads) of operating a transmitter in the External Services of the British Broad-casting Corporation rose from  T35 per hour to  1-71 per hour anincrease of 27 per cent. The reduction of about 30 per cent, in theuse of transmitters over the past five years unfortunately does not meanany corresponding reduction in the maintenance costs of installations.(d) The increase in the average salaries of locally-recruited teachers of Englishemployed by the British Council in British institutes overseas is illus-trated by the following examples:  1947-48      1952-53       Increase(Average per teacher)    Per cent.  .* Limasol, Cyprus       ...      ...      270 501 85-5Athens............      328 519 58-2Milan   ............     279 630 125-8(e) Since 1947 the rates paid for Government advertising of the British Indus-tries Fair have risen by the following percentages:  &apos;Per cent.Ceylon        ................     84Australia      ...............      74Canada        ...............     54Sweden        ......      ......      ...      47South Africa............    ....      39New Zealand............      ...      38Belgium       ...............      24United States ...      ...      ...

Taking rising costs into consideration as well as the absolute reduction inthe sums made available for overseas information since 1947 it is probably fair tosay that, over the whole field, the effective effort deployed has been approximatelyhalved since 1947.24. It is important to note that only some 23 per cent, of the expenditure in overseas information work is incurred in non-sterling currencies, as is shown in thefollowing table:   ,Estimated Expenditure 1952-53		Sterling	Non-Sterling	TotalForeign Office		239,560	1,257,690	1,497,250Commonwealth	Relations Office	226.400	37,500	263,900Board of Trade		20^37	58,863	-   79,300Central Office	of Information	733,000		733,000B.B.C.....		4,658,000	162^000	4,820,000British Council	...             ...     &apos;      ...	1,682,600	746,400	2,429,000Colonial Office		36,700	....   ..	36,700		7,596,697	2,262,453	9,859,150N.B.-Estimated expenditure by the B.B.C. at present exceeds the authorised grant-in-aid for the current financial year ( 4,750,000) by  70,000 and Treasury approval for a supplementary estimate may have to be sought later in the year.
Distribution of Expenditure in Overseas Information Services25. A table showing the present distribution of overseas information expendi-ture, both by geographical areas and by different information services, is attached as Annex III. The allocation of overheads to geographical areas is necessarily arbi-trary and this applies with particular force to the External Services of the british broadcasting Corporation, of which the overhead costs are very large indeed inrelation to the costs attributable to particular services. Nevertheless the following figures provide some picture of the relative scale of our information effort in eightmajor areas of the world:  	  Sterling	Per cent.Western Europe        .........	2,938,000	38Middle East	999,730	13Commonwealth.........	989,790	13Colonies ...      ............	682,050	south-East Asia and the Far East  ...	608,040	8Latin America.........	579,440	8Russia and Satellite Europe ......	459,230	6U.S.A........    ...	427,870	5   .	7,684,150	100General  Overseas   Services   of   the		B.B.C., and ...      ..........	1,519,000	B.B.C. Monitoring and Transcription		Services     ..........	656,000	(unallocated to areas)9,859,150    &apos;26. In deciding what should be the scale of the information effort in each areasuch factors as its size, population and strategic, political and economic importancehave to be weighed; in practice, however, another important consideration in deter -mining what must be the level of expenditure in any given region is the nature ofthe media which it is necessary or possible to use in order to obtain the requisiteeffect. For example:  (a) Western Europe, which accounts for 38 per cent, of the total expenditure,is an example of an area with a large literate population and one whichis of great strategic, political and economic importance. Ail media canbe employed in Western Europe, but broadcasting by the British Broad-casting Corporation accounts for about half the expenditure owing tothe great number of languages that must be used. Transmission costs are bound to be high, partly because medium wavelengths have to beused; to confine the service to the relatively inexpensive short wave-lengths would greatly reduce its effectiveness.(b) The Commonwealth and the Colonies, which between them account for22 per cent, of the total expenditure, are likewise of major strategic and political importance and present free access for informationactivities of every kind. In the Colonies, however, the use of mediaother than the British Council and the British Broadcasting corporation is handicapped by the fact that since 1949 the Colonial Office has been unable to maintain overseas any information officers under its owncontrol:(c) The United States of America is the most important single target for theForeign Office information services, since Anglo-United States relations were a corner-stone of British foreign policy. Moreover, the UnitedStates of America provides a major market for our exports. Expendi-ture, however, is relatively low compared with other areas, because theBritish Council does not operate in this area and the British Broad-casting Corporation largely covers its needs with the General overseas service in English. The programmes specially designed for the UnitedStates are of modest proportions and inexpensive.(d) Russia and Satellite Europe constitute a target of immense importance, butexpenditure is relatively small because information media other thanbroadcasting are for all practical purposes ruled out.
The &quot; Common Ceiling &quot;27. The arrangement introduced in 1948, whereby a total sum available for overseas information work is annually distributed over four Departments of Stateand three agencies, is complex and not altogether satisfactory. It is complex becausethe various parts are to some extent interdependent, so that adjustments in oneset of estimates entail adjustments in others. It is unsatisfactory because depart-mental interests are competitive, and largely divergent; the three Overseas depart-ments, as has been noted in paragraph 15 above, use &quot; information &quot; for differentpurposes, because their responsibilities are different, and one department cannotjudge the relative importance of an operation conducted by another. There isno objective standard by which to judge whether it is more important to broadcast to Vietnam, open a British Council centre in West Africa or appoint an assistantinformation officer to Ottawa. Each may to the department concerned be the most urgent need of the moment. The essential divergence of interest makes it peculiarlydifficult to judge whether we are spending the total sum available in the best totalway, having regard both to short-term needs and long-term developments. the division of the sum available between the spending departments and agencies is,of course, only made after considerable inter-departmental discussion from whicha spirit of give-and-take is by no means absent; but in practice, and with somequalifications about the British Broadcasting Corporation which presents special problems (see paragraph 30 below), the recent tendency has been for the pattern of expenditure, between the different departments and agencies, to be perpetuatedmore or less unchanged by the simple process of reducing the previous year&apos;s figures by a more or less level percentage cut all round. If the original pattern was right, it may have ceased to be so in the changed conditions of to-day; and ifit was wrong, successive economy cuts and variable rising costs may haveexaggerated the original error.28. There are further grave disadvantages inherent in the present system ofa &quot; ceiling &quot; for overseas information work as a whole. The information servicesof the overseas departments cannot, and indeed ought not to be, regarded asself-contained activities unrelated to the rest of the work of the departments con-cerned. For the Colonial Office, information work is part of the machinery of colonial administration, although as noted earlier the Colonial Office maintainsin the Colonies no information officers under its own control. For the Common-wealth Relations Office and the Foreign Office, information work is an instrument of Commonwealth policy and foreign policy; in addition, their information officersabroad are an integral part of the missions to which they belong, performing, inaddition to identifiable information work, other functions which are also essentialto the proper conduct of the missions. Already successive cuts in the Foreign Officeinformation services have reached the point where a decision to remove aninformation official creates a need for a corresponding increase in the diplomaticstaff. The existence of an overall overseas information &quot; ceiling .&quot; unrelated to theneeds of the individual departments affected makes it difficult for the overseas departments to plan the best use of their resources and, in the case of the ForeignOffice-, to deploy their forces overseas to the best advantage.29. In these circumstances, and without prejudice to the question whetherthe total amount of money budgeted this year for overseas information work is adequate, we consider that there are strong grounds for a departure from the present practice of fixing a common ceiling for this work. If the common ceiling were abandoned, each department conducting overseas information work would prepareits estimates on the basis of its own requirements, making its own assessment ofthe amount of funds to be devoted to information work within the total funds available to it; and the several departmental estimates for information would besubject to Treasury scrutiny as part of, and in precisely the same way as, otherproposed departmental expenditure.(e) The Middle East and South-East Asia and the Far East, accounting betweenthem for 21 per cent, of the expenditure, are both of major importancepolitically and strategically.  All media are used.(/) Latin America. All media have been effectively used, but, despite latin america&apos;s vast commercial potentialities and its twenty votes in theUnited Nations, serious cuts have had to be made owing to limited funds.
30. As indicated above, the British Broadcasting Corporation presents special problems, which are intensified by the existence of the common informationceiling. In the first place, the External Services of the British broadcasting corporation account for nearly half (in 1952-53 48 per cent.) of total overseas information expenditure; so that any additional funds allocated to the british broadcasting Corporation within the common ceiling, or any decision to exclude the British Broadcasting Corporation from the effects of any reduction in the ceiling, exercise a disproportionately great effect on the smaller spenders. In thesecond place, the British Broadcasting Corporation has in many respects markedlyless &quot; elasticity&quot; than other elements in the overseas information field; forexample, wavelengths, once abandoned in the interests of economy, are probablylost for good and may jeopardise the restoration of a service, once curtailed,whereas an information office overseas, closed and later re-opened, may in timeregain its original influence. Over the last year there have been thirty-eightinstances* in which, the British Broadcasting Corporation has dropped a transmis-sion and the wavelength has been taken up by somebody else. In fourteen casesthe wavelength was taken up by Moscow and in ten cases by Voice of America orRadio Free Europe, and the remaining fourteen by various countries includingIndia and Switzerland. Again a high proportion of the expenditure of the ExternalServices is attributable to capital expenditure and operating costs, which are not(except in the broadest sense) sensitive to reductions in programme hours or evenin the range of foreign languages broadcast. In the third place, the ExternalServices would have a vital role to play in time of war; so that reductions whichmight seem tolerable under present conditions may have to be rejected because theywould impair the British Broadcasting Corporation^ ability to perform its wartimefunctions. The British Broadcasting Corporation is, moreover, required to meetfrom its grant-in-aid expenditure on defence arrangements entirely unrelated to current operational needs. A programme of defence planning has now had to be initiated to provide the essential requirements for maintaining reduced services under emergency evacuation conditions. The total capital cost (over four to fiveyears) is of the order of  600,000, of which  82,000 was spent in 1951-52. There-after the incidence of capital expenditure is bound to increase rapidly as the defence scheme is implemented, while heavy continuing revenue expenditure on main-tenance charges will be inevitable. So far, costs incurred in this connection havebeen met (indirectly) by the curtailment of output operations. Additionally, an appreciable part of the expenditure of the External Services (nearly ten per cent,in 1952-53) is attributable to the monitoring service, which (although it contributesto the work of the External Services and indirectly to that of other overseas infor-mation agencies) is carried out primarily in the interests of the service and otherdepartments. It is no doubt for these and similar reasons that during the years1949-50 to 1952-53 (Estimates) the External Services&apos; share of a total expenditure,which has decreased by 11-3 per cent., has risen by 8 - 3 per cent. to the obviousdetriment of the other information agencies and services.31. One at least of these special considerations applies also with particularforce to the British Council. The work of the Council is, as was said earlier,essentially long-term. Its object is to create a favourable atmosphere, and this is something which can only be done by a slow process of arousing and holding theinterest of people overseas; its organisation is in many respects that of an educa-tional institution. Continuity in its operations is thus vital to the effectiveness ofthe Councils work. Withdrawals and reductions do positive harm and can onlybe made good later by a disproportionate expenditure of time, money and labour.Although we recognise the constitutional and political difficulties, we believe thatthe value of the CounciFs work would be very greatly increased if means could be devised to give it at least the same assurance of a settled income over a period ofyears as is enjoyed, for example, by the universities through the University GrantsCommittee or by the Council itself as regards its receipts under the colonial development and Welfare Acts.32. We have tried in the preceding paragraphs to explain the difficulties inherent in any system under which, simultaneously with the preparation of departmental estimates but in isolation from them, a given amount of money andin each of the last six years a reduced amount is prescribed for overseas information and has to be divided between the overseas departments andthe three agencies which serve them. We cannot in the circumstances give an assurance that the distribution of our available resources is precisely right.* This has been kept confidential.42479 c 2
The ideal criterion by which to judge the correctness of the present pattern of over-seas information work, both geographically and by media, would be a formula bywhich the extent to which British policy was being furthered by the differentmedia in different areas of the world could be measured. Such a yardstickclearly does not exist. Indeed, one of the characteristics of overseas informa-tion work is the difficulty of measuring its &quot; impact.&quot; This is particularlytrue of the long-term information operation which, if successful, createssubconscious receptiveness to British ideas. A business firm can in the long runassess the value of its advertising and public relations work by its financial receipts.The overseas information services have no such yardstick. They can, of course,make some estimate of the number of regular and occasional listeners to a givenforeign language service, compare the number of feature articles.distributed withthe number published or calculate the number of foreigners who, over a givenperiod, have studied in British universities through the medium of the british council or learnt English by means of &quot; English by Radio.&quot; By such means, how-ever, they can only form a judgment of the relative effectiveness of differentinformation techniques in a particular country: the political effects of these activities, even in one country, cannot be acurately measured or related to theircosts. It is a matter of even greater difficulty to weigh costs against value receivedover the whole range of countries, British as well as foreign, in which information services operate.33. We have no doubt that it is this difficulty which underlies and explainsthe divergent opinions held by public opinion, the press and members of all parties in the House of Commons about the effectiveness of the overseas information services in relation to their cost. There are those who think that they could be abolished without disadvantage to the national interest, and others who thinkthat they should be greatly expanded. Others think that either a financial savingor- greater effectiveness could be achieved by concentrating entirely on directanti-Communist propaganda. Others again believe that available funds should be devoted to a much greater extent to one particular medium or to one particular area. None of these criticisms can in the nature of the case be disproved; we canonly repeat our conviction that in the modern world overseas information work isan essential instrument of policy and that in the particular circumstances of the&quot; cold war &quot; it is a necessary complement to the existence of the armed forces as a safe guard against the expansion of world communism and an insurance against war.34. These convictions are, of course, based on more than personal beliefs.For the purposes of this enquiry we have circularised Her Majesty&apos;s representatives in foreign countries and in the Dominions and nearly all Colonial Governments,with whom in any case the overseas departments are in constant communication on information matters. Their replies have shown that there is a complete consensusof opinion about the practical value and, indeed, necessity of information work,and a general belief that if more funds could be found it should be increased.35. To supplement these expressions of opinion from those who have specialopportunities for assessing the value of information work we feel that it may be appropriate to give a few illustrations of its effectiveness as a weapon againstcommunism. The following facts and figures exemplify the decline in communist influence in Western Europe in recent years: -France(a) 20 per cent, reduction in party membership between 1950 and 1952;(b) a reduction from 5  million Communist votes in 1946 to A\ million in 1951;(c) a reduction in the circulation of Humanite from 530,000 in 1946 to 195,000in 1952.DenmarkCommunist vote reduced from 141,000 in 1947 to 94,500 in 1950;Western germany decline of 35 per cent, in party membership between 1949 and 1951.Throughout the period covered by these examples there had been a steady increasein our output of anti-Communist publicity material and its acceptance bv foreign government, professional bodies and associations, trade unions and the press.
It is a legitimate inference that our material played a substantial part in theenlightenment of public opinion overseas and the resulting decline in Communiststrength and influence. In certain particular fields, indeed, the direct and indirecteffects of our publicity may be traced almost with certainty. For example, in sweden 500 trade union branch executives were Communist-controlled in 1945;by 1952 this figure had been reduced to 100. In Finland 129 Communists were elected to trade union executives in 1947; by 1951 this figure had fallen to 65.In France Communist attempts to provoke general strikes in february and June, 1952, were a complete fiasco, and the strong line taken by the FrenchGovernment, which would have caused an outcry a few years earlier, was greetedwith relief and almost universal approval. Again, anti-Communist informationoperations can certainly claim a very large part of the credit for the almostuniversal rejection by non-Communist trade unions and Socialist parties of communist invitations to form &quot;united fronts&quot;; and the general recognition ofthe Peace Campaign as a Communist racket can certainly be attributed mainly tothe concerted campaign against it carried out by our information services. Inparticular, we might mention that the much advertised Latin-American PeaceConference, having been hounded and harried first from Mexico and then Brazil,had finally to be held in a back room in Montevideo, and that the Egyptian Govern-ment refused to permit the projected North African Peace Conference to be heldin Cairo. In a rather different sort of field we have no doubt that the successfulseparation of communism from nationalism in India owes much to the campaign of enlightenment carried out by our information services. British information services cannot, of course, claim sole credit for these achievements, since otherGovernments have also been active to greater or lesser extents, but in most casesthe original stimulus came from the British side and much British material hasbeen used by them.36. In sectors of work other than the direct struggle against communism,it is less easy to quote concrete instances of the effectiveness of information work,since, if the desired results are achieved, so many other factors may have contri-buted. By way of example, however, it may be worth mentioning that, with the help of carefully planned publicity campaigns, our relations with Arab Govern-ments and peoples were scarcely affected by recent events in the Canal Zone andvigorous publicity over the Abadan dispute has, even in the case of Pakistan, heldextreme views in check, although this issue, like that of our relations with Egypt,continues to exercise Moslem opinion in Pakistan. When the popular appealabroad of the Egyptian and Persian cases is remembered, these are no meanachievements. In the commercial field, the direct connection between information work and export promotion is not easily detected, though it certainly exists in the sense that a predisposition to &quot; buy British &quot; can be created only by propa-gating the belief that this country stands in the forefront of scientific and mechanicalprogress. There is evidence from many parts of the world (including at least oneColonial area) that lack of information about United Kingdom affairs results in a reduced demand for British products. Widespread publicity for a particularway of life causes people to seek the implements required for following that life and in their provision the country of origin must start with an advantage. Thenumber of buyers attending the 1952 British Industries Fair fell most heavily fromthe very areas in which for lack of funds the publicity effort had been most cur-tailed; by contrast, there was a record number from the one area (United States)in which expenditure has been deliberately left at a steady and adequate level.&apos; General Conclusions37. We believe we have established the necessity for, and the advantages of,efficient overseas information work, on both political and strategic and indeedon economic grounds. The crucial question which now arises and which we, asa body of officials and others directly concerned with information, approach withsome diffidence is whether, having regard to financial conditions, the 0 - 25 per cent,of governmental expenditure now devoted to overseas information is excessive orinadequate. We are clearly not qualified to express any opinion on the properdistribution of the national resources; we must therefore confine ourselves tosaying that in our view the international situation, the Communist ideologicalonslaught on the free world, the need to right the balance of payments and thenecessity of maintaining Commonwealth relationships, all demand an intensifi-cation of overseas information work and a measure of continuity in its financing.
London, S.W.1,14th July, 1952.in order to permit operations to be so planned as to produce their full cumulative effect&apos;. The Chiefs of Staff, who have been represented throughout our discussions,have authorised us to say that they regard overseas information work as anessential element in the conduct of the &quot; cold war,&quot; and that, in present circum-stances, where economic conditions are forcing us to curtail the build-up of our military strength, they consider an intensification of information activities overseasessential to the consolidation and improvement of our strategic situation.

The Colonial Office Information Services.VI. The Board of Trade.VII. The Central Office of Information.VIII. The External Services of the British Broadcasting Corporation.IX. The British Council.I. introduction the object of overseas publicity is to influence public opinion overseas.Means2.   The means at our disposal for doing this are:  (a) The Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office and Colonial OfficeInformation Services and the Central Office of Information (includingthe London Press Service);(b) The British Broadcasting Corporation External Services;(c) The British Council;id) The ordinary public media of news and publicity, such as, for example, theBritish press and news agencies and the foreign correspondents inLondon, in so far as they can report on ministerial or official announce-ments, ministerial speeches, &amp;c, and can be guided and helped toreport and to write or send helpful material;(e) Organised or aided visits of influential people from overseas.Aims3.  Our broad aims are:  (i) To help British foreign policy by building up the prestige of the UnitedKingdom, helping to remove frictions which may arise throughmisunderstanding of British intentions and policy and convincing thepeople of foreign countries of the peaceful and friendly intentions ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government, their reasonableness in negotiation and the mutual advantages resulting from agreements and continuingco-operation.(ii) To help to maintain and strengthen the bonds between commonwealth countries, to encourage the development of democratic institutionswhich -take the United Kingdom as their model, and to ensure so faras possible that Commonwealth countries use their increasing powers in a manner favourable to the British connexion.(iii) In the widest sense the projection of Britain and the Commonwealth and empire, to which is now added in appropriate cases information and publicity in support of the United Nations, North Atlantic treaty organisation, Brussels Treaty Organisation, Council of Europe, &amp;c;this part of the operation serves both to make ourselves, our way of life and our views known, understood and respected overseas.(iv) To further our ends in the &quot; cold war &quot; by presenting the democraticanswer to Communism, by exposing Soviet and communist ideas,regimes, ends, policies and manoeuvres, by encouraging resistance tothem everywhere in the free world and, behind the&quot; Iron Curtain, byenlightening the ignorance imposed upon the peoples of the soviet union, China and the satellite countries, keeping them in touch with
; i6the outside world and, while not inciting them to revolt or subversive activities, keeping them in touch with the West and their laitn and hope alive. . .        ,   ,(v) To spread an&apos; understanding of Britain&apos;s economic position and ot tiieproducts, current achievements and capacities of British industry witba view to promoting co-operation with British commercial policy andto developing the sale of British exports.Methods4. The methods of carrying out oversea publicity fall under two headings-the distribution of information and publicity material, of which the official originis plainly stated, and publicity of an indirect kind where the facts and views whichwe wish to disseminate reach the public without attribution to official or evenBritish sources. The first method is used for films, display material, referencepapers and libraries, pamphlets and magazines and very often with feature articles and photographs, though these last two will at least as often appear in local news-papers without their attribution to British official sources. The second methodtakes the form of giving information or expressing views, either oral or written, toleaders of local opinion ranging from publicists such as journalists andbroadcasters to persons of standing in the sphere of politics and trade union affairs,religion, culture and education who are likely to disseminate this information andthese views on their own authority. They may equally be invited to visit theUnited Kingdom at our expense so that they may form sound views for them-selves. Indirect suggestion is particularly valuable in the case of anti-communist propaganda. The division between the two methods is not, however, hard andfast. Indeed, they complement each other, and in the anti-communist field overtpositive publicity is the necessary counterpart to negative propaganda of a confi-dential kind. Moreover, facts aud opinions contained in an official pamphlet maybe picked up and used as his own by a local writer or speaker, while a journalistor broadcaster, to whom the facts and opinions have been given orally; mayreveal their origin by describing them &quot; as the British view.&quot; The welcome givento openly disclosed British official publicity varies from country to country, theacceptance probably being greatest in some of the Commonwealth countries and colonies.. Outside the special case of the countries behind the Iron Curtain thereare only a few, like Egypt and Persia, where the demand for it is not much greaterthan the supply. This is due to the fact that it has on the whole come to beregarded by users as factually accurate and not &quot;just propaganda.&quot; There isalso, of course, for a number of different reasons, a strong and genuine interestin Britain and British affairs and a continuously lively demand for information about them. In addition to this direct placing of official British material, it isimportant to provide background information and guidance, so that the desiredresults may appear in the local press or be expressed by radio commentators andother publicists and by influential people in other walks of life (for example,Trade Union leaders, and members of political and cultural organisations) in theirown words. This method enjoys the additional advantage that, once a fact or viewhas been so adopted and used, it may be given little less than a nationwidedistribution by a well-known broadcaster or journalist. It should be noted that inone way the British Council and the B.B.C. on the one hand and the directInformation Services of the Oversea Departments on the other can complementeach other. The fact that the B.B.C. and the British Council are not Governmentdepartments gives their services a special character and influence, in spite of thefact that it it widely known that their funds are provided by the Governmentand even though they are generally regarded as emanations of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment. On the other hand, the British Governments reputation in the field of publicity is such that the authority, and, therefore, the influence of statements of fact will often be increased rather than diminished by their plain attribution to official sources.5. Co-ordination of Official ActionThis can best be dealt with under each of the headings (a) to (e) as set out inparagraph 2 above. .(a) There is co-ordination between the work of the three overseas departmentsby means of day-to-day contacts as necessary between the officials concerned andas regards co-ordination with the Central Office of Information by means of
TIP-II. The Foreign Office Information ServicesGeneral1. The Foreign Office Information Services utilise the general means and methods described in the preceding part. Their own particular instruments arethe Information Officers attached to most of Her Majesty&apos;s Embassies andLegations abroad. The duty of these officers is to make the policies of her majesty&apos;s Government understood and, if possible, accepted by those in each country who play the greatest part in moulding public opinion. Personal contact with such people requires close and continuous cultivation; and, if it is to bearfruit, personal contact must be reinforced in material ways by the supply ofauthentic texts; by background memoranda based on official information; by a reference service; by a flow of feature articles, often translated and speciallyadapted for the local market; by the showing of documentary films privately,non-theatrically (e.g., in schools and universities, Government institutions, &amp;c.) andcommercially; and by the provision of lecturers. Nor can these types of materialdeal with politics alone. The acts of Her Majesty&apos;s Government must be givenflesh and blood, so to speak, by being shown against a background of the life andthoughts of the British people. The sum of these information activities is described by the phrase &quot; the projection of Britain.&quot; It is a continuous and cumulativeprocess which suffers greatly from interruption but which, if properly done, forms the indispensable foundation for successful &quot;drives&quot; or &quot;campaigns&quot; on particularthemes.2. Written and visual material (see Part VII) is supplied by the Central Officeof Information, which produces it in consultation with the Foreign Office. Forimmediate effect there is the London Press Service, sent out in four programmesdaily by wireless and air mail, which give the texts of important statements andspeeches on British foreign policy and accompany these with background informa-tion and, where appropriate, guidance as to the line to be taken in comment. from various informal meetings connected with the Central Office of Information^ pro-duction for the overseas departments in the various media and of the overseas information Services (Official) Committee.(b) As regards B.B.C. external services close relations are maintained at all levels between the three overseas departments and the officials of the B.B.C.external services concerned resulting in almost daily consultation. In the case of theForeign Office regular meetings are held between the Political Departments, theInformation Departments and the B.B.C. Regional Editor concerned. Forbudgetary and general policy questions there is constant contact between theDirector of External Broadcasting at the B.B.C. and the Assistant Under-secretary in charge of the Information Departments of the Foreign Office; the Director of external Broadcasting at the B.B.C. is also invited to Foreign Office meetings whichreview Soviet and communist activities.(c) Policy and budgetary co-ordination with the British Council is effected bythe inclusion amongst the nine ministerial nominees to the Councils ExecutiveCommittee of representatives of the three overseas Secretaries of State and thePresident of the Board of Trade, by the attendance of Foreign Office officials at british Council committees and by daily contacts between officials. In respect ofthe Colonial Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office close control of bothpolicy and operations results from the fact that the Council works for the depart-ments on a reimbursement basis.(d) Contacts with the press, &amp;c, are of course maintained by the public relations Departments of the overseas departments.(e) Visits of influential people from overseas are organised both by the over-seas departments direct and through, for, example, the Inter-Parliamentary union and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. The arrangements in thiscountry are made and carried out for the overseas departments by the central office of Information or the Government Hospitality Fund as the case may be.The British Council handles large numbers of visitors, whose expenses are borneby the United Nations Agencies and overseas governments and institutions, andin addition organises visits on its own account.6. The following sections deal in more detail with the policies and methodsemployed at the present time by the various departments and agencies concerned.
inthe Foreign Office point of view these programmes represent the core of the LondonPress Service. There are also a number of regional transmissions giving news ofspecial interest to various areas of the world, e.g., Western Europe, the middle east, the Far East. For short- and medium-term effect the Central Office suppliesa service of feature articles and photographs in many forms to be placed in thenational, local and trade press; reference material for the information staff and specialist enquirers; and commercial periodicals and newspapers for reading-roomuse and distribution. For long-term effect films are the main service, supportedby film strips and display material of various kinds. Films are placed theatricallywhere possible and also lent extensively from local film libraries; the other material is placed where it can best be used, largely with educational authorities.3. Under the arrangements described in Part I these activities are powerfullysupplemented by the external services of the B.B.C., which are themselves described in more detail in Part VIII. An aspect of them that deserves mention here, how-ever, is the extent to which material put out by the B.B.C. is heard not merely by direct listening on the short waves, but also, by means of retransmissions andtranscriptions, on the listeners home services. In the countries behind the iron curtain the B.B.C. is the only surviving means of direct access to the public.Despite intensive jamming there is evidence that its programmes are both audiblein part and listened to in the Soviet Union and the satellite countries. The specialoperation for overcoming Russian jamming is closely co-ordinated with the Voiceof America, with which the B.B.C. has excellent relations. Equally good andfruitful are the relations between the British and American monitoring services.(For details of the work of the British Council in foreign countries please see part IX.)4. As mentioned in Part I, visits of influential people from abroad have beenfound one of the most rewarding forms of getting publicity overseas. While thevisitors are in the main journalists, groups drawn from other fields can be just asvaluable. The programmes of these visits are broadly of a definitely politicalcharacter (although direct propaganda is, of course, eschewed) and are designedto give the visitors, within the space of two to four weeks, a bird&apos;s-eye view ofthe life, work and administration of this country. Each group is normally accom-panied from start to finish by the British Information Officer from the country concerned, who is thus enabled to get to know each member of the party with athoroughness that would be hard for him to achieye in any other way.5. As indicated in the introduction (Part I, paragraph 3 (iii)) the paramountaim of the Foreign Office Information Services is to display to the world the life and thought of the British people as a leading example of the democratic alternative to Communism. Fresh evidence must constantly be produced to demonstrate thatdemocracy as practised in the United Kingdom (and, where appropriate, in othercountries of the Commonwealth) offers mankind a better and surer way of solvingtheir problems than any form of authoritarian Government. In addition it isnecessary in the current world situation to show in all possible detail the extent and seriousness of British rearmament. This is done with a two-fold object:firstly, of convincing the United States that this country is making its full contri-bution to the joint efforts of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries;and, secondly, of convincing the free world at large (and especially our continentalallies) that preparation for armed resistance to Soviet aggression, so far from being a forlorn hope, offers the best, if not the only, hope for continued peace and freedom. In this context special attention is given to the growth and developmentof the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation itself and appropriate publicity is devoted to such other Western organisations as that of the Brussels Treaty andthe Council of Europe. Close co-operation is maintained with the North atlantic treaty Information Service. Close liaison is also maintained with the Ministry ofDefence, the War Office, the Admiralty and the Air Ministry with a view to ensuring that information on defence matters is properly presented and to securing their assistance in the supply of material to the Information Services and of facilitiesfor visitors from abroad.6. Another subject of special effort is the contribution being made by Britishbrains, skill and money to the economic development of backward foreign countries,especially those of the Middle East and, as things unfold, of South and South-east asia through the Colombo Plan.7. The areas in which the greatest efforts to &quot; project Britain &quot; are beingmade are the Middle East and South-East Asia where illiteracy and nationalism
combine lo provide Communism with a Loo-easy target. But the area to be coveredis vast and the Foreign office&apos;s resources are still nowhere more than the bareminimum for worth-while activities.8. Another area where a special effort is made is Germany where theconditions of the occupation raised special problems and furnished unusual oppor-tunities. The subject of information work in Germany is discussed in detail inPart III. I9. Co-operation with the State Department is constant  and close in thosefields where United States and British information policy are closely aligned, suchas combating communism, publicising the defence efforts of the United Kingdom,the United States and their allies under the North Atlantic Treaty and furtheringthe aims of that Treaty as a whole. Such co-operation is not, of course, practic-able in certain other lields such as the strengthening of Commonwealth ties andthe promotion of exports. But there is much practical co-operation with the UnitedStates Information Service in the field, designed to extract the maximum dividendfor the free world from the efforts of our two information services.10. Special mention must be made of the British Information Services (B.I.S.)in the United&apos;States, which does irreplaceable work even though its resourcescannot be called adequate for dealing with that vast and turbulent area. B.I.S.operations are based on the demand which exists in the United States for authoritative-tive information about the United Kingdom, other Members of the Common-wealth and the Colonies a demand which increases every day as our services aremade known to an ever wider circle of influential persons in a position to mouldpublic opinion. The operations of B.I.S. are centred around a large and wellequipped reference library which has in the last thirty years achieved the status of an institution. There are also sections which deal with the press and radio,photographs, films and educational visual aids and a section which arranges fortours by British speakers. Many of these operations, notably speakers, films andphotographs, are on a semi-paying basis and bring in a considerable dollar revenue.At the London end special efforts are made to cater for the varied and specialiseddemand for material, much of which is processed and adapted in B.I.S., New York,to meet the standards required in the United States.

Ti IK? l&amp; tJdQNALTHEWiPMIB UNDER SECTION 3 (4.-none Aflt he: Hub!bHome Publicity on certain International hems16.   In accordance with Article 2 of the Brussels Treaty and Article 3 of the atlantic Treaty and by virtue of the obligation of member States to collaborate with the Council of Europe the Central Ollice of Information organises on behalfof the Foreign Office a limited amount of publicity on these subjects in the United. Kingdom. .III. Information Services for Germany. The Information Services in Germany were set up under immediate post-war conditions to accomplish special tasks and have since remained sui generis. At first- these services were the responsibility of the Control Office for Germany and Austria.Later this Office became the German Section of the Foreign Office. Since 1st April,1952, the information work in Germany has been closely integrated with-that ofthe. Foreign Oflice, although separate budgetary provisions are still made for it. This is inevitable so long as the greater part of the information services-expenditure in Germany is paid out of local currency and occupation costs. the contribution from occupation costs will come to an end upon the entry into forceof the new Contractual Agreements, but it is-hoped to offset this loss by contributions from the German authorities themselves.The problem. In Germany, as elsewhere, the justification for the expenditure of public money on information services is that they play an important and useful role in furthering British policy and therefore contribute to the defence of the UnitedKingdom. A very large information organisation was built up to deal with theimmediate post-war problems. This has been drastically curtailed during the past three years, but it remains comparatively greater than that maintained in any other part of the world, because the situation of Germany is still the most vital for the safety of the United Kingdom.3. Before the last war ended. Her Majesty&apos;s Government joined their allies in making plans for the future control of Germany. Not only was Nazism to beextirpated, but Germany was to be disarmed and demilitarised and her Governmentre-established under safeguards to ensure that she should not turn again towardstotalitarianism and pursue a selfish national policy which would lead the worldinto another war.   Meanwhile, her people v   c to be trained in democratic: practice
and imbued with democratic ideals. This task of reorientation fell largely uponInformation Services Division and upon the Education Branch of the control commission for Germany:  (a) Information Services Division had the dual function of restarting massmedia of information press, radio and films so as to create anenlightened and responsible German public opinion, and, at the sametime, of explaining British policies and institutions. It had also toeradicate the influence of the former Reich Propaganda Ministry.(b) The Education Branch had to rebuild the educational system of the british zone of Germany with the long-term aim of training a new generation of Germans with faith in democratic values and a sense of responsibility-  for the political development of their country.   It had also to train new- teachers, as the teaching profession had been the backbone of Nazism.4. The growing conflict between Soviet Communism and Western demo-cracies changed Germany from a sphere of co-operative activities into one of conflict. Germany became the most important theatre of the cold war, and, fromthe point of view of United Kingdom security, certainly the most vital. her majesty&apos;s Governments policy towards Germany is now therefore based upon two major objectives:  (a) To deny Germany and her industrial and man-power potential to theSoviet bloc and to communist penetration; and(b) To secure the willing co-operation of Germany in the community of .Western democracies for the preservation of peace and the common defence against Soviet imperialism.To achieve these objectives Her Majesty&apos;s Government have had to take definiterisks. A new German Government has been created in a truncated portion ofGermany. The stronger and more independent this Government becomes, the stronger and less controllable will be the pressure towards German unity and a revision of the Eastern frontiers. Moreover, for the effective defence of western europe, Germany must be given those weapons of war which will increase herpower and independence. To secure her willing support and co-operation in european defence Her Majesty&apos;s Government must advocate the unity of a Germany-free to choose for herself between allegiance to the East or the West. Should shechoose allegiance to the East or even neutrality, she would be an even greater menacethan in the past. These risks are being met by restoring to the Federal GermanGovernment all the powers and attributes of sovereignty, by eliminating all possiblesources of friction between the two Governments, by endeavouring to develop a -common consciousness against Soviet imperialism and by linking the interests of federal Germany as closely as possible to the fate of the West.5. This policy is faced with many difficulties. Germany has not yet freedherself from the habits of the past, and the staunchness of her allegiance to demo-democracy remains to be proved. The German outlook is still provincial and has neveracquired a broad world-wide perspective. The Germans are mainly concernedwith their own material well-being.&quot; Diplomatic negotiations are considered only .from a German point of view and are deemed satisfactory only if they bring acontinual series of successes and &quot; national victories.&quot; There is every risk that,when association with the West ceases to yield big enough dividends, the GermanGovernment will turn to the East. In any event they will be under continual&apos;pressure from that quarter. ;6. The association of Federal Germany with the West has not marked theend of the cold war in that country but rather has been the occasion for its intensi-fication. Soviet pressure exercised through the Eastern Zone of Germany is increasing and once again the population of West Berlin is bearing the main bruntof the attack. This pressure will encourage those Germans who favour the neutral-isation of Germany and strengthen the existing desire for re-insurance. At the sametime the re-establishment of German armed forces may resurrect the arrogantnationalism of the past and the desire to create Germany as a third force in world affairs (the equipoise of Bismark), possibly in federal association with France andother Western European Powers. Already there are signs of the growing strengthof Right-wing elements in politics and the press. German public opinion is stronglyemotional and is being played upon by political leaders for their own ends. This. prevents the growth of a reasonable body of opinion which can act as a regulator
in moments of crisis. The presence of large allied forces in Germany can preventthe resurgence of a militant totalitarian regime, but only with the help of german democratic forces. In any case their security and their effectiveness as a defence force for Western Europe depend upon a friendly German people co-operatingwillingly in the defence against communist imperialism.7. It is evident that British diplomacy faces a difficult task in Germany andthe full resources of our information services will be required (a) To explain Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ policy and to build up Britishprestige essential to the fulfilment of this policy.(6) To expose the aims and methods of Soviet communist propaganda and policy and the false allurement of neutrality.(c) To help in the establishment of a living democracy.(d) To foster good relations between British forces stationed in Germany andthe civilian population.(e) To uphold the morale of the West Berlin population.(/) To keep alive democratic ideals in the Eastern Zone of Germany and beready to rehabilitate this Zone in the event of German unity being achieved.Method of Approach8.   Information work in Germany to-day is the responsibility of (a) Information Services Division which operates very much as do information officers in other foreign countries. The Information Officers are more numerous,however, and are serviced, in addition to the Central Office of Information material,with special publicity material especially designed and adapted in London for usein Germany. This is made necessary because there are conditions obtaining inGermany which are not generally found in Western European countries.(i) There are a large number of local newspapers engaged in a hard struggleto maintain their comparatively small circulations. The retention ofexisting readers and the attraction of new ones tend therefore to assumed distorted importance. In consequence editors, no matter what their personal convictions, will not readily print unpopular material.(ii) This is important because German public opinion is strongly emotionaland adopts a strictly short-term and short-sightedly national point ofview on most economic and political issues which arise. This isexploited by vested interests and by political parties. (Even the federal chancellor has been known to stimulate press criticism of allied policy to give himself a weapon in political bargaining.)(iii) Under these conditions even the most careful preparatory work witheditors may fail to ensure an unbiased treatment of British policy justat the time when such a treatment is most necessary.(iv) In times of crisis, therefore, a hearing for British policy may perhaps onlybe ensured by means of directly controlled information media, suchas the German Service of the B.B.C. and the new British overt weeklypublication Englische Rundschau. Both are already playing a significant part in information work and, in spite of the fact that theB.B.C. German Service signal is becoming increasingly difficult to hearin Germany, they would assume greater importance in an emergency.(b) Cultural Relations Division, formerly Education Branch, which operatesin ways similar to those adopted by the British Council in other countries, althoughits work has a strong political flavour. The major aim of this work is to denyGerman youth to Communism and to capture it for democracy. To this endinfluence is brought to bear on the teachers, in teaching-training institutions andin the schools themselves; on the parents, in adult education groups and in com-munity activities, mainly through the British Centres; and on the young people themselves, in youth groups, schools and universities. This work is possible only because of the goodwill established with German educationalists, including theLand authorities. Moreover, Wilton Park is maintained in the United kingdom to encourage Germans to develop democratic conceptions as a positive antidoteto totalitarianism and to give a better understanding of British life and policy.(c) The British Council which is responsible mainly for the projection of britain in the fields of music, drama and art.   It makes available scholarships
to British Universities and English lectors to German Universities. It makesarrangements for some German visitors to the United Kingdom. It also maintainsa library in Germany which, in co-operation with the libraries of British Centres,will provide to the Germans all the facilities of a National Central Library for english books.id) A special, very small group which directs anti-communist activities. this group operates under the direct &quot;supervision of Information Research Department.9. In London close co-operation is maintained with the German Service ofthe B.B.C., the British Council, and the Central Office of Information in order toensure that the maximum impact results from the most economical use ofinformation material.IV. The Commonwealth Relations Office Information ServicesOfficial Information services. The Commonwealth Relations Office reaches its audience through theInformation Offices now established in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, SouthAfrica, India, Pakistan, Ceylon and the Irish Republic. In India, Pakistan and australia there are regional Information Offices also, making a total of fifteenoverseas posts. The Information Office keeps in close touch with editors, radiocommentators and publicists and- is responsible for making the best and most economic use of the technical services supplied by the Central Office of Informationunder Commonwealth Relations Office policy direction. Very satisfactory contactshave been made with educational authorities in Commonwealth countries, whouse our visual material widely. Reference libraries and film libraries are main-tained in all posts and in some countries the Information Office acts as agent forthe sale of Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office publications. Methods, technique and requirements vary according to the country: no two Commonwealth countriespresent identical problems. For example, in India and Pakistan the information services have a particularly important part to play in keeping alive the links between those countries and the United Kingdom and in meeting the wishes of their peoplefor contact with the British people, thought and way of living. The supply ofinformation about such things as our governmental institutions, the social services,particularly health matters, and the treatment of diseases like tuberculosis, has beenfound especially welcome in the Asian countries. Even in the older commonwealth countries, however, the strength of their ties with the United Kingdom cannotbe taken for granted and this has been emphasised by recent developments in SouthAfrica. The aim of the Information Services there is to keep alive the Britishoutlook in the face of increasing Afrikaner domination. This is a heavy task inpresent circumstances for the one Information Office. In Southern Rhodesia thereis no Information Office to assist the United Kingdom High Commissioner indealing with the many delicate problems presented by the proposals for federation.Communism2. As pointed out in paragraph 12 (e) of Part II, there is close contact with information Research Department of the Foreign Office. The fact that her majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are able to provide studies of communist claims and Soviet aims has been disclosed confidentially to all Common-wealth Prime Ministers with the exception of Southern Rhodesia, where a HighCommissioner was appointed for the first time in 1951. In all but two Common-wealth countries, India and Pakistan, all such material is by agreement passed tothe Commonwealth Government to handle through their own Information Service.In India and Pakistan a certain amount of anti-communist publicity is undertakendirect by the British Information Service without the official knowledge of the Gov-ernments concerned. No attempt is made to conceal its British Information Serviceorigin, but the fact that the material is derived from United Kingdom official sourcesis not acknowledged. Comments and criticisms by High Commissioners and information Officers are welcomed in Information Research Department who,within the limits explained in paragraph 15 of Part II, make every effort to meetspecial requirements. In nearly all material intended for public disseminationInformation Officers have full discretion to edit for local tastes. -    ,
V. The Colonial Office Information ServicesOfficial Information services. For the dissemination in the Colonies of official information material aboutBritain it is necessary to rely exclusively on the Information Departments of colonial governments, since the Colonial Office maintains no information staff of its ownin the Colonies. Such staff did exist for a period in East and West Africa, but the establishments were discontinued on&quot; grounds of economy. While the Colonialinformation departments do what they can, the position is not wholly satisfactory,since the prime duty of these departments is to serve their own Governments and notHer Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. They are not for the mostpart very large and have more than enough to do on behalf of their own Govern-ments, with the result there is a constant liability for work on the &quot; projection of britain&quot; to take second place. The movement toward greater political indepen-dence, and greater local control of policy and of funds, tends also in this direction.The British Broadcasting Corporation &quot;3. The British Broadcasting Corporation programmes which reach the other commonwealth countries are the General Overseas programme, the north american Service, the Eastern Services and Regional Services to Australia, NewZealand, South Africa and Southern Rhodesia.. The Commonwealth relations office has no direct control over the content of these programmes, but there is a constant exchange of views between the Commonwealth Relations Office and theBritish Broadcasting Corporation, particularly so far as the services to asian countries are concerned. There is close liaison on the handling of problems likeKashmir, where awkward political considerations arise. (For a general description of the work of the B.B.C. External Services please see Part VIII.)The British Council4. The Council operates in Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan and ceylon and representation in these countries is a direct result of invitations fromthe Governments concerned. Recent events in Canada, particularly the publicationof the Massey Report, have produced a most favourable atmosphere for the estab-lishment of the Council in Canada, and it is known that the Canadian Governmentwould warmly welcome this. The only obstacle is finance and this is now underurgent consideration. The Council has no representative in South Africa. BothCanada and South Africa receive certain services, such as lecturers, exhibitions, &amp;c,direct from London. The Council work in the Asian countries is handicapped bylack of funds and the planned expansion has had to be halted for financial reasons.5. In the older Commonwealth countries the Council has a very definite role in strengthening those traditional ties with the United Kingdom which already showsigns of weakening. In the Asian countries, where it is vital to retain the link withthe West, the Council can do much, through its positive exposition of westernthought, to develop the British connection and resist the communist influence. TheCouncil representative in all countries acts in consultation with the-United kingdom high Commissioner. (For a general description of the work of the British Councilplease see Part IX.)Contact with the Press in the United Kingdom6, The Information Department of the Commonwealth Relations Office keepsin very close touch with the press and the British Broadcasting Corporation, andpays special attention to briefing the United Kingdom press, and correspondentsfrom other Commonwealth countries, on matters affecting commonwealth relations.Visits to the United kingdom. In co-operation with the Central Office of Information facilities andcontacts are arranged for influential editors and journalists who are visiting theUnited Kingdom from Commonwealth countries. For financial reasons, however,it is no longer possible to invite editors at Her Majesty&apos;s Governments expense.
The only means of ensuring a really satisfactory &quot;projection of Britain &quot; in theColonies would be to re-establish in them services directly controlled from London,as is the case in the Dominions and foreign countries. This point receivedemphasis in the discussions of the Conference of Colonial Public Relations Officersheld in London in June 1951.2. This is not to imply that present arrangements are totally ineffective.Much use is made in the Colonies of, for example, the material prepared by theCentral Office of Information, the more so since that material has been increasinglydesigned to fit local needs and interests as well as to &quot; project Britain.&quot; Much ofit partakes of the nature of political education in the broadest sense and as suchhas a direct local application and value.Broadcasting(a) Broadcasting in the Colonies3. Since the time of the Plymouth Report in 1937 it has been accepted as an object of policy that broadcasting should be developed in the Colonies as a publicservice and on a non-commercial basis. Its importance and value have never beenunder-estimated, but lack of local resources, together with the stringencies of thewar years, for long held back development, and in certain territories commercial interests, particularly in the field of wire rediffusion, have obtained facilities. How-ever, in March 1949, the sum of  1,000,000 was earmarked from Colonial develop-ment and welfare funds for capital expenditure on Colonial broadcasting toward a programme of development estimated in 1948 to require capital expenditure of 1,800,000 and recurrent expenditure over ten years ofover  3,000,000. From thenet allocation of  1,000,000, grants totalling  639,258 have been made and theremainder allocated for schemes in. the planning stage. It is estimated that anadditional  250,000 will be required from United Kingdom funds to carry forward the programme.(b) The British Broadcasting corporation the General Overseas Service may be described as the backbone of Colonialbroadcasting, since its news-bulletins in particular have always formed -an essential part of the developing local services. The B.B.C. also provides through the Tran-scription Service a wide range of first-class programme material including music,talks, features, plays, &amp;c, of which considerable use is made not only by govern-ment broadcasting services but by commercial rediffusion and broadcasting con-cerns also. Another important part played by the British Broadcasting Corpora-tion in respect of the Colonies is the help readily given in planning and developingColonial broadcasting itself. Funds have been made available under the colonial development and Welfare Acts (see above) for capital expenditure on Colonialbroadcasting systems; but the Colonial Office looks mainly to the British Broad-casting Corporation for technical advice on planning, design of stations and equip-inent, for the loan or secondment of technical and programme staff and for thetraining of local personnel. The general policy, which is in line with political trends,is to decentralise responsibility for the development and control of Colonial broad-casting. However, the very fact of the almost total dependence of the colonies on the British Broadcasting Corporation for assistance in so many ways ensures thatthe development of Colonial broadcasting is in itself*a &quot;projection of Britain.&quot;(For a general description of the work of the B.B.C. External Services pleasesee Part VIII.)British Council ...4. The Councifplays a valued part in the Colonies in the sphere of adulteducation in the broadest sense and particularly in the important field of race rela-tions. This is undoubtedly enhanced by its^ unofficial status, notwithstanding thefact that there is no secret about the source of its funds. Eschewing specificallypolitical matters, the Council, for example, arranges for lecture tours and shorteror longer&apos;courses on such matters as local government, community development and trade unionism, by which means British tradition and achievement are broughtto bear on local problems and needs. The Council moreover encourages localartistic and cultural endeavour and, by thus giving proof that local traditions andachievements are appreciated, helps to prevent them from becoming narrowlynationalistic and defensive.
&apos; 5. The CounciFs activities moreover constitute a valuable meeting-place, basedon common interests of a variety of kinds, for people of differing races, creeds andoutlooks, and this serves to break down and prevent racial and communal antagon-ism. The broad purpose and effect of the work of the British Council in the Coloniesis, by assisting Colonial peoples to realise themselves socially and culturally, toengender understanding of and goodwill toward the country which has done this service. &quot; 16. Colonial Governors were asked in 1949 for their views about the value ofthe British Council in the Colonies, and, as a result of their unanimous commendartion, it has been desired to expand the CounciFs work, which by its nature becomesthe more important as Colonial peoples move toward greater political indepen-dence and as bonds of sentiment and mutual understanding replace authority.Financial stringency has for the time being prevented the realisation of this policy.(For a general description of the work of the British Council please see part IX.)Press1.Contact is maintained by the Colonial Office Information Department withthe United Kingdom press and also with agencies and representatives of the over-seas press. Such contacts supplement what is sent overseas by other means, e.g.,the London Press Service administered by the Central Office of Information. Inaddition the Colonial Office seeks to assist the development of a healthy press inthe Colonies themselves. Hitherto, the main action taken from London has been tosecure eight places a year for Colonial journalists in the London Polytechnicjournalists&apos; course, now in its third year. This course can, however, hardly be saidto have firmly and finally established itself in the eyes of the profession, and it hasbeen found necessary for reasons of economy to discontinue provision from UnitedKingdom public funds for bringing Colonial journalists to it. Moreover, the meretraining of journalists cannot be expected to bring about a radical improvementunless and until the Colonial press is financially able to employ men of good educa-tion and training. This is largely a matter of circulation; and consideration is being given to ways and means of helping the Colonial press to improve distribution.This work is mentioned because a primitive and backward press is not only novehicle for the &quot; projection of Britain &quot; but actually operates in the opposite sense,being limited mainly to sensationalism and abuse of government, to the virtualexclusion of news, which it is not competent to handle.Visits8. Visits to this country, in respect of the Colonies, are handled by the central office of Information and the British Council, the former, in practice, concentratingmainly on parties of journalists and the latter on other personages. These visitsgiven careful planning, appear to have valuable and lasting results and it is con-sidered that the money is well spent. Care is taken to provide for each individual or group a programme suited to their particular background and interests.9. Steps are taken to look after Colonials resident in this country for longerperiods, notably students. The British Council manages hostels for them, as agents for the Colonial Office, and the regional organisations both of the British Counciland of the Students Department of the Colonial Office exist in large measure forthis kind of work. The number of Colonial students now in this country (despite the growth of University Colleges in the Colonies) is very much greater than itwas before the war. This work is in the main financed outside the informationprovision. In addition much useful work among students and other Colonials inthis country is done by voluntary bodies, e.g., The Victoria League.Home Publicity on Colonial Matters10. This paper is concerned with overseas publicity only; but in respect ofthe work of the Colonial Office mention must be made also of home publicity,with which the Colonial Office Information Department is also concerned and onwhich in the last three years a considerable effort has been made. This effort isbased on the following premises:  (a) That an informed and interested public opinion in this country is necessary as a basis for a consistent and enlightened Colonial policy.
VI.-The Board of trade. Though the Board of Trade has a close interest in overseas information work, it does not maintain information staff overseas but relies on the information officers of the overseas departments, who act in the same relation to the Com-mercial Diplomatic Officers and Trade Commissioners overseas as they do to thepolitical officers. In India and in the United States there are Information Officerswhose special function it is to concern themselves with economic and trade mattersbut, though these officers naturally have particularly close connections with theBoard of Trade, they are appointed by and carried on the strength of the overseas department concerned.(b) That the degree of interest in and knowledge of Colonial affairs displayedin Great Britain has itself an important bearing on the attitude of colonial peoples toward Britain.11. An enquiry carried out by the Social Survey on behalf of the ColonialOffice in 1948 confirmed and made precise the belief that in these respects publicopinion in Britain left much to be desired. Action since then has; been based onthe findings of that survey, which was repeated in the summer of 1951, with theconclusion that the process of education of United Kingdom public opinion stillhad far to go. In the meantime, a main and most effective medium for thispurpose, the Central Office of Information Lecture Service, has been abolished on grounds of economy.Communism in the Colonies12. True Communism in its most dangerous sense, i.e., which hold the worldwell lost for Moscow, is not widespread in the Colonies and is mainly confined to malaya. Elsewhere, the only organised Communist Party of note is the old-established AKEL Party in Cyprus. Nevertheless, it is known that the disaffectionof Colonial peoples plays an important part in Soviet strategy, and a particulareffort has been made in the last year in respect of West Africa. Large quantitiesof literature have been dumped in West Africa and strenuous attempts have beenmade to &quot; get at&quot; West Africans in this country. A special visit was paid to west Africa early in 1951 by Mr. W. H. Ingrams, C.M.G., O.B.E., Adviser on overseas Information to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, to study thesituation and this report is under consideration. Mr. Ingrams&apos; main conclusions were-(a) That a good deal of Soviet-inspired publicity material was in evidence.(b) That most if not all of it was not especially designed for nor adapted to influence the Africans.(c) That nevertheless, while it did not appear to be making communists inthe strict and dangerous sense, it did have some appeal in nationalisticand anti-government circles, which would readily grasp at any ally whoappeared to be able to assist them in their nationalist ambitions.Mr. Ingrams later paid a visit to East and Central Africa, and his report isnow under consideration. His broad conclusion is that the countering of the potential communist threat there is a matter less of propaganda or counter-propaganda than of seeking through policy and administrative practice to remove the conditions on which communist propaganda can work.13. Concurrently, steps have been taken to increase the output of materialdisposing of communist pretensions, and particularly in relation to those matters where communist propaganda may be expected to have most immediate appeal.In addition, the output of &quot; projection of Britain &quot; material in constantly reviewedso that it may by implication contribute most effectively to the neutralisation of communist propaganda.14. But (as in the case of the Colonial press) the question of distributionstands out. Distances and the relative poverty of communications render a reallyclose and effective literature distribution system costly and uneconomic; and thereis no easy short cut to a really comprehensive improvement. Ways and meansof improving the coverage of existing agencies are, however, under consideration.
t f J Board of Trade gives regular guidance to the Central Office oflniormation about the contents of the latter&apos;s overseas press services in their com-mercial aspects and has similar contact with the B.B.C. It has since the war spon-sored the production of publicity material, particularly films, primarily intendedtor dissemination overseas, the work and cost of dissemination being undertaken by the overseas departments. In practice, however, the only material of this kindcurrently m production is that designed to publicise the British Industries Fair.3. The Exhibitions and Fairs Branch of the Commercial Relations and exports Branch of the Board is responsible for organising United Kingdom partici-pation in commercial exhibitions and trade fairs overseas, including the provision in appropriate cases of official Government stands.4. In some areas of the Commonwealth (e.g., the West Indies and cities likeWinnipeg and Durban) the Board of Trade&apos;s Trade Commissioner is the only resi-dent official owing undivided allegiance to the United Kingdom Government. Assuch, he finds himself compelled to undertake a varying range of duties which arenot directly concerned with trade; even if he is not encouraged to discuss general-aspects of United Kingdom policy, he often cannot help doing so. On the otherhand, lack of staff, even more than lack of guidance, makes it impossible for himto do any systematic information work.5.   Overseas publicity in its commercial aspects takes four main forms:  (a) Routine publicity for concrete news items, e.g., conclusion of a trade agree-ment. This is normally carried out by press contacts in London andin the overseas capitals of the other countries concerned. Broadcastingalso has its normal function to perform. Care has to be taken to keepin mind the interests of third parties, e.g., it is important, and not alwayseasy, to make sure that advance warning and explanation of announce-ments relating to East-West trade is sent to the British information services in Washington and the United Kingdom Information officer in Ottawa.(b) Explanation of British economic policy against the background of con-temporary Britain, so as to increase understanding of Britain&apos;s trade policy and promote a disposition to co-operate with it. Here againpress contacts are the most important, supplemented by the materialsent out in the Overseas Press Services of the Central Office of Informa-tion and by background information papers which can act as sourcematerial for officers.(c) Publicity for individual British products and classes of products, intendeddirectly or indirectly to stimulate demand for them; another form ofthis is publicity for news items which are likely to enhance Britain&apos;industrial and scientific prestige, even if the product concerned .is not directly intended for sale overseas. This is a difficult field because the stage at which a product has news interest is seldom the stage at whichit is in plentiful supply; unless publicity for it is handled carefully, theonly result may be to set up a demand which cannot be met and socause frustration. On the other hand, firms are usually unwilling towork out detailed supply arrangements until they are satisfied that thedemand exists, which in turn depends on making people aware of the product. In this field, films and photographs provide a valuable rein-forcement to the media already mentioned.(d) The British Industries Fair constitutes a special annual operation in this sector. The existence of a single occasion at which a large part of Britishindustry is on show makes it possible to focus effort on a far larger andmore thorough campaign than could be organised for a number of separate events. The campaign provides an excellent peg on which tohang a great deal of information about British industry and trade policy generally, while the embarrassments described in the last paragraph areavoided since the only claim made for any exhibitors product is theindisputable one that it will be on show at the Fair.(e) Action to increase familiarity with and respect for British science andculture, on the assumption (which must remain more a matter of faiththan of proven fact) that this will in the long run increase the demandfor British products. There can be no doubt that the cultural prestige of France has increased French exports of luxury goods, and it is
natural to think that action taken to raise the prestige of Britain in parallel fields wall have the same result. British engineering exports to canada have been indisputably hampered by the use in Canadian tech-nical colleges of United States rather than British text-books; in thesame market British shoe manufacturers find that one of their chiefobstacles to increased sales is the fact that the United States, through-United States publicity media, tends to set fashion standards. Action to remedy this situation must be long-term, and its results will be hard to trace. Demonstrations of British medical methods have been proved to result in orders for British medical equipment, but such a direct connec-tion is the exception rather than the rule. This fact does not, however,reduce the importance of the matter. Official action in this field is largely a matter for the British Council, supplemented to some extent by the B.B.C.; the main weight of the work must be borne by commer-cial channels (e.g., the potential influence of British feature films), but sdoften the commercial results obtainable, though solid, are not quite solidenough to attract private enterprise without the backing of some guaran-tor or sponsor.VII.-The Central Office of information the Central Office of Information is a common service department respon-sible for providing services of information and publicity material. &quot;On the over-seas side it provides these services primarily for the Foreign Office, the Common-wealth Relations Office, the Colonial Office, the Board of Trade and the british council. They are designed for the widest possible use, but the tendency for sometime has been away from the omni-directional service and towards a greaterdegree of specialisation, by region, group of countries or even a single country,if it is of sufficient importance. The cost of these services is met from the central office&apos;s vote, in the form either of allied or agency services to the departments and bodies asking for them, but the cost of distributing them in overseas countries isborne by the overseas department concerned.2.   The services fall into seven groups:  (a) Press Services, consisting of topical informative material for the guidanceof editors and journalists and of articles, paragraphs and pictures inmany forms for direct insertion. The press medium has one advantage over all others, for the ultimate consumer of the information does not know that it is United Kingdom publicity, because there is no indica-tion of source. The effort is made primarily to the national press ofeach country, where it exists, but much attention is given also to thecarefully read regional press, which is often more influential than thenational newspapers. Specialist weeklies and monthlies are also used,especially for economic and trade promotion material, for these againexercise considerable influence upon their readers.(b) Film services; certain films are specially made for overseas showing;others, made publicly or privately for other purposes, are acquired,,re-edited and sometimes re-angled. All can be given sound-tracks in&apos; different languages. Films are shown (i) in public cinemas, (ii) toprivately organised groups, often of specialists (these shows can bearranged wherever darkness and electricity are available), (iii) on tele-vision, a rapidly expanding means of distribution. They can be usedto give general information or specific instruction with a view to action.Their great value lies in the fact that &quot; seeing is believing &quot; and in thelong time they last, which offsets the high initial cost. They have aspecial task in countries with illiterate populations.(c) Display services, including posters, maps, display photographs and film-strips. As with films, display services have the advantage of &quot;seeingis believing &quot; and what they lose in range they make up on the ability to be studied at the observer^ own pace, which is especially important in backward countries. These services are much used for schoolinstruction. For adults their effectiveness depends upon an efficientsystem of organising sites and changing displays.(^Reference and reading-room services, comprising a reference service forInformation Officers and selected recipients, a book selection service for
T7 -2.   &apos;VIII. The External Services of the British Broadcasting corporation the general scope of the External Services of the B.B.C. is in accordance withthe Corporation^ Charter and Licence prescribed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.The prescription relates to the languages used and the duration of daily broadcastslibraries and the supply of newspapers, periodicals and official publica-tions. Reference services not only enable the Information Officer to answer any question put to him: they also are his principal source of specialist information to distribute, e.g., to editors, professors and senior civil servants.(e) Pamphlets and Magazines; the pamphlet, whether it be a general bookleton Britain or a pamphlet on a single subject, is generally used as anintroduction to other information material and given to the new&quot; contact.&quot; Pamphlets are of prime importance for the recently literateand politically conscious, with whom the printed word cuts deeper thanthe visual image. They pass from hand to hand, are easily pocketedand are almost indestructible. Magazines have a high propaganda valuebecause of the long term and regular nature of the impact made.(/) The arranging of tours within this country for overseas journalists andothers, such as trade union leaders, in order that they may get a general impression of Britain, with emphasis on their special interests. Thismedium carries to its conclusion the &quot; see for yourself &quot; advantage offilms and photographs, so long as visitors have an opportunity ofchoosing what they wish to see and any impression of window-dressingis avoided. Because most visitors are journalists a great deal of freepress, broadcasting and book publicity is obtained from these visitorswhen they return home.(g) Assistance and encouragement to the producers of commercial products,e.g., periodicals which have an information value.3. The use made of this material is very great. This is shown by the regularreports on usage made by Information Officers to their departments, which are carefully studied within the Central Office, by the flow of evidence, e.g., presscuttings, coming back and by the information provided by exporters of enquiriesreaching them and quoting the source of the interest being taken. It is likely that over half the newspaper reading public of the world outside the Iron Curtain sawor read at least one, and in many cases several dozen, Central Office of Informationitems in the course of 1951.4. The estimated cost to the Central Office of Information and the stationery Office of all these oversea services in 1952-53 is  733,000. The world market for press, film and other material produced by the Central Office of Infor-mation could, of Course, be increased many times. It is limited by money and bythe small size of staffs handling it abroad and not by any difficulty in placing it.5. The Central Office of Information is linked with the overseas departmentsby a number of committees, by means of which broad lines of policy guidanceare conveyed and the planning of the material to be produced is done. In addition,there is much day-to-day contact between the officials of the overseas departments and those of the Central Office of Information. The Central Office services are,in the result, ordered by the overseas departments for each of their posts and despatched by the Central Office of Information. The Central Office has no officersof its own overseas but is kept in touch with the use made of its material by reports from most Information Officers Overseas, by visits to it made by information officers on leave and by infrequent visits of its own staff to the field.- 6. The.material produced by the Central Office of Information is directed at the general public overseas in all subjects, except the strictly cultural, and atspecialists in political, social and economic matters, including the commercial.The proportion&quot; of the services taken up with different subjects varies with thenational and and international situation, as well as from one service to another,At present, taking the world as a whole, the proportions are roughly as follows:economic and export promotion subjects, 31 per cent.&apos;; defence^ foreign affairs,Commonwealth affairs, 41-5 per cent.; various aspects of British affairs, political,administrative, social, scientific and many others, 27 - 5 per cent.
and is, in practice, undertaken by the Foreign Office, the Commonwealth relations office, the Colonial Office and (for the special interests of all British servicemenoverseas) the War Office. Other Government departments may be designatedunder the Licence for participation in the prescription. The services can be groupedas follows. (The facts quoted are those applicable to the various services after giving effect to the curtailments which resulted from the decision of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to fix the grant-in-aid for 1952-53 at the same figure as the previous year, viz.,  4,750,000.)(a) The General Overseas Service, which is a direct successor to the B.B.C.Empire Service established in 1932, constitutes a universal service in english for English-speaking communities throughout the world,including those in the Dominions and Colonies. In order to meet worldtime differences it is in operation for 21 hours a day. The departure from the previous continuous service of 24 hours daily, which took effect in May 1951 as a result of the reduction in grant-in-aid requiredfor the year 1951-52, deprives some potential audiences of service atgood listening times.. ib) The European Service in 23&apos; languages (including English), amounting inthe aggregate to 31 hours 55 minutes daily. Of this total, over 21 hours&apos;broadcasting time is concentrated in the main evening listening hours.The remaining 10 hours are used to provide broadcasts in the early morning pre-working hours and at mid-day periods, which have hadto be considerably curtailed, and, in the case of some countries,eliminated altogether.(c) The Overseas Language Services, in twenty languages aggregating about14\ hours daily directed to countries outside Europe, notably latin america, Mediterranean and Eastern countries and the Far East.(d) Specialised services supplementary to the foregoing, including French for canada, Afrikaans for South Africa and Maltese. Similar supple-mentary services in English carry special/programmes for certaincolonial audiences, to Australia and New Zealand and to the far east. There is also a restricted &quot; special project &quot; service to north america of programmes designed for rebroadcast by previous arrange-ment with the station concerned in Canada and the United States. Inthe aggregate the supplementary services amount to just over 9 hours^ daily. -(e) The Transcription Service, which provides B.B.C. programmes in recordedform for use by broadcasting stations in other countries. distribution to foreign countries is free, but modest financial contributions are received from most Dominions and Colonies. Owing to unavoidabledelays in processing and distribution none of these programmes can betopical.(/) The Monitoring Service is one of the important national sources ofinformation about events and the trends of opinion in other parts ofthe world. It is responsible for the interception of broadcasts in a variety of languages from other countries, and it works in close collaboration with the official monitoring service of the United Statesof America. The resultant service of information is provided to theForeign Office, to other departments of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, to commonwealth and United States authorities and also to the B.B.C.&apos;output services, to the news aspects of which it is of special value.2. The output services range in scope from such languages as Afrikaans,Malay and Burmese, with 15 minutes of programme time daily, to the extensiveschedules of the General Overseas Service. In all the services a comprehensive,well-balanced and objective service of news is regarded as a first essential ingredient&apos;In the second place there is in varying amount, according to the time available foreach service, exposition of British policy and thought &quot;in current affairs. This* second ingredient involves again in varying measure a projection of the Britishway of life in-forms which are primarily determined by the amount of broadcastingtime available for the various countries concerned. Careful thought is given toensure that at any given time and to any given audience an appropriate balance isstruck between these three main ingredients.
3. All programmes broadcast by the B.J3.C. originate in this country andare carried on wavelengths suitable for direct reception by the listener. Betterresults can be achieved in many parts of the world if the transmissions from theUnited Kingdom can be relayed by stations geographically better placed. A greatdeal of relaying is achieved by getting broadcasting stations not under B.B.C.control to rebroadcast news bulletins and other programmes. The B.B.C. alsooperates itself a high power station at Tebrau in Malaya, which carries relays byshort wave to the Far East and South-East Asia, and buys time on a station atDobl near Graz in Austria which carries relays on medium wave for central europe and the Balkans.4. The B.B.C. conducts as part of its output a service of English lessons underthe title &quot;English by Radio,&quot; which is directed to many parts of the world inappropriate forms. In this field it co-operates closely with the British Council.The lessons have achieved a wide following and, apart from their intrinsicusefulness, they serve to lead listeners on to the programmes broadcast in theEnglish language. s -5. The wilful jamming, under communist direction, of the B.B;C.&apos;s Services toRussia and the satellite countries presents a problem of special significance. Thejamming of the B.B.C.&apos;s Russian Service started in April!949, but it was not until december 1951 that the interference was clearly extended to other services. since then the wilful jamming operations have been steadily extended to the point where(in May 1952) they affect all B.B.C. services to Russia, Poland, Finland, Czecho-slovakia, Hungary, Albania, Bulgaria and Roumania. At the directionof Her Majesty&apos;s Government everything possible is being done to circumvent thejamming. The principal means of combating the menace is the radiation of each service on the maximum number of transmitters that can be made available insimultaneous operation on different wavelengths (which need to be selected with due regard for a variety of technical considerations). This involves heavy expen-diture which, compared with that on normal operations, is relatively unprofitable.The only alternative, however, is to accept defeat at communist hands as soon asthe jamming of any service is introduced.IX-The British council general Purposes and organisation. The British Council is an institution incorporated by Royal Charter forthe purpose of promoting knowledge of the United Kingdom and the english language abroad and developing closer cultural relations with other countries. Itserves other purposes besides those of an information service in the sense in whichthe expression has been used to describe the work of the Departments of State.2. The Council depends to a great extent upon the voluntary co-operation ofnon-official British institutions. It depends, for example, upon the help of the universities, of such bodies as the Royal Society or the Institutions of Civil, Electricaland Mechanical Engineers, of the organisations concerned with adult education and social welfare or the voluntary associations interested in student welfare. In thefield of medicine, which is a very important one, since the development of medical research and organisation in the United Kingdom is a major interest abroad, theCouncil depends upon the help of the Royal Colleges and the faculties associatedwith them, the British Postgraduate Medical Federation, the British Medical Asso-ciation, the Royal Society of Medicine, the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons,various centres of medical research, hospital authorities and public health officersand large numbers of individual specialists and research workers, as well as upon that of the Medical Research Council and the Ministry of Health. In much of its work the Council co-operates with such departments as the Ministry of Education,the Home Office and the Scottish Office and civic authorities throughout the UnitedKingdom. All these interests are worked into the Councils organisation and atsome point represented in it. This information is given to show that the councils a very complex organisation compared with a government overseas informationservice and represents a working partnership between the State and institutions and bodies which in this country lie outside the control of the central government.
q 3. Nor can it be said that this paper relates to a distinguishable branch of the council&apos;s work. Its &quot; information &quot; activities cannot be isolated from its other work. Even when it is acting directly on&apos;behalf of the Government, other con-siderations besides information must be taken into account. On the one hand, forexample, the Council is an officially-recognised agent of the United KingdomGovernment for the purposes of the various cultural agreements between the UnitedKingdom and foreign States: on the other, it is responsible to the Colonial office for the welfare of Colonial students in the United Kingdom.4. The Council is concerned to a relatively large extent with personal relation-ships and to a relatively small extent with the provision of material. The contactsof the CounciFs staff abroad are mainly with individuals, rather than the general public, and with groups that may consist of teachers, students, scientists, doctors,lawyers, government officials, Army officers or trade union officials. The Counciltries to influence people who can influence other people.&apos; In the United Kingdomthe staff handle in a year about 3,700 visitors, who are here for some form of studyor investigation, and attend to the welfare of some thousands of students in addition.5. The Council is also engaged to a substantial extent upon work which iseducational in the strict sense. Thus, it teaches English on its own premises toabout 18,500 fee-paying adult pupils and to many more in overseas universities andother institutions. In Latin America it seconds a small number of staff to the Latin-American-British Cultural Institutes, in which there are about 30,000 pupils. InCertain countries, e.g., India, it organises summer schools and refresher courses for local teachers of English, and it is assisting the introduction of English into the&quot;Greek State schools by helping to organise the training of the necessary teachers.It helps and makes grants to British schools abroad and seconds some staff toforeign universities. It grants scholarships to overseas postgraduate students forstudy in British Universities.   Its libraries abroad contain about 900,000 volumes.6. The CounciFs work needs to be considered in relation to the cultural workof other governments, of the United Nations and of political groups such as theCouncil of Europe, the Brussels Treaty Organisation and perhaps in the future theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The Council differs from the cultural servicesof foreign countries mainly in the following respects:  (a) It spends one-third of its income not on foreign countries but on theCommonwealth countries and Colonies.(b) It has a stronger regional organisation at home which enables it to offerbetter services than the others can, eg., for Colonial students or united nations Fellows.(c) It has a wider role in relation to university education and the arts because in general these subjects are in this country outside the control of any department of the central Government.7. If a generalisation must be made, it is fairly accurate to say that, seen fromthe &quot; information &quot; angle, the CounciFs general purpose is to bring the greatestnumber of influential or potentially influential people abroad into direct and ifpossible personal contact with British thought and British life, along the line of contact likely in each case to be most fruitful: that is, in general, the- line ofcommon occupational or (subject to certain limitations) recreational interest. Itthus creates a basis of understanding and friendly feeling which is essential to political co-operation and support and a basis upon which the government infor-mation services can work. It also creates understanding of what the British stand for in the cold war or would be defending in a hot war. And it produces as a by-product various tangible advantages such as the adoption of British methods,equipment and material.Methods of Financing the Council&apos;s Work8. The Council is financed from United Kingdom public funds under a some-what complicated system on four parliamentary votes: for its work relating toforeign countries by a grant-in-aid on the Foreign Office vote and for its workrelating to Commonwealth countries and Colonial territories on a repayment basis as agent for the Commonwealth Relations Office and the Colonial Office respec-tively. It also receives grants from the Colonial development and welfare funds oni.
a five-year plan. These payments are supplemented by receipts from students&apos; fees,courses, the sale of material, &amp;c. and by other general receipts amounting in1951-52 to about  380,000. Apart from occasional benefactions the Council has norevenue except from the above sources. It should be realised, however, that thereare other substantial contributions to the cost of the operations in which it isconcerned.  The following examples may be given: -(a) Upwards of  1.00,000 is being expended in the current year by the united nations and.the United Nations Specialised Agencies on fellowshipschemes administered by the Council.ib) There is a growing tendency for Colonial governments to assist financiallyin particular branches of the wOrk in the territories concerned.(c) The Latin-American-British Cultural Institutes, most of which have beenfounded or developed by the Council, have an annual revenue fromfees and subscriptions of probably more than  200,000, as well assubstantial capital assets in the shape of buildings purchased.id) The British schools abroad are mainly sustained by pupils&apos; fees and private^ donations.. (e) The Council is in touch with some hundreds of anglophile societiesthroughout the world which are largely sustained from their own resources.(/) What the Council does is often part of a reciprocal arrangement. The costof the exchange of university teaching staff on short visits between british and foreign universities is shared by the various foreign govern-ments and the universities themselves. Foreign Governments recipro-cate the scholarships granted by the Council by giving scholarships toBritish students for study in foreign universities. The cost of a dramaticor musical tour is frequently shared&apos;by a foreign Government or localcommittee.Work Overseas9. The Council is represented in thirty-six foreign countries, five Common-wealth countries and nineteen British Colonies. It is not represented in the UnitedStates. It is represented in Poland but has been ejected as a menace from Czecho-slovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria. It is still nominally working in China, where,as in Czechoslovakia, it has been very popular but is being squeezed out by theCommunist Government. Its premises in Cairo were destroyed in the recent riots(they have been replaced), where they appear to have been second on the list used by the communist-inspired destruction parties. The CounciFs priority areas are regarded as being at the present time: the Middle East (Egypt, Persia and Iraq, Syriaand Lebanon, Israel and Jordan), the Far East (Burma, Siam, Indonesia, Japan andthe British territories), Central and East Europe (Germany, Italy, Finland, Poland,Austria, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey), the new Dominions (India, Pakistan and ceylon) and the African Colonies.10. The kind of work and the methods in a foreign country vary as Indonesiadiffers from Germany. Where the educational system is bad and local facilities forthe study of the English language and literature and British institutions are defectiveor, absent, the Council may be engaged in the direct teaching of adults. This willusually be in British Council Centres, e.g., the British Institutes in the Middle East,or it may be entirely in native institutions as in Turkey. In a highly-developedcountry like Norway or Finland results can be obtained more cheaply and effec-tively through co-operation with local Workers&apos; Educational Associations, universityextension organisations, &amp;c. In such a country, there will be no direct teachingbut close co-operation with universities, adult education, professions and occupa-tions. There will be highly-developed library work and much contact with leaders in all cultural fields, including science and medicine. There will be vacationcourses and many anglophile societies and visitors to and from the United Kingdom.In an under-developed country.there will be, besides the direct teaching of English:advice to Governments on British practice in education, administration, &amp;c; thetraining of teachers of English; British examinations; scientific and medical infor-mation and various forms of technical assistance, e.g,, visiting experts lecturing onnursing, medicine or welfare, and the training of future experts and administratorsin the United Kingdom.
11. The Council&apos;s work in a country is controlled by an official called &quot; theRepresentative.&quot; Since countries so differ, it is difficult to state the duties of anaverage representative, but the following should give a reasonable idea for a sizeableforeign country:  (i) Running his Institute or Centre with perhaps two or three branches outsidethe capital, e.g., in the chief industrial city (Milan or Sao Paulo). Centreactivities include: teaching of. English to adult fee-paying students if that is undertaken in the country in question; library with block loans to local libraries; study groups and talks on British subjects by staff and visiting lecturers (the groups may comprise teachers, doctors,lawyers, welfare workers, &amp;c.); dramatic &quot;groups, concerts; small exhibition-tions. Whether there is a &quot;Centre&quot; in the technical sense or not,library work will almost always play a prominent part.(ii) Contact with heads of universities, cultural, iearned and adult educationorganisations, ministries and leading cultural figures. Acting as a link between British and foreign universities, professional, learned and occupational bodies. Thus the showing of medical films in Italy tospecialist audiences, and other contacts with Italian officials and doctors,led to the introduction of British methods of anaesthesia in Italy, with british lecturers visiting Italian hospitals, Italians coming to england for training and ultimately to initial purchases of British anaesthesiaequipment worth  500,000.(iii) Arrangements for recommended visitors to the United Kingdom; selection,with local Ministry of Education and universities, of British Councilscholars and bursars; publicity and choice of delegates for british council courses in the United Kingdom; information for specialistsgoing to United Kingdom at their own or their Governments&apos; expense.(iv) Extramural teaching of English, Sue., in local institutions (this may vary from lectures.in universities to classes for the armed forces, e.g., for theTurkish Air Force); training of teachers of English: vacation coursesheld locally: general links with local schools, training and technical colleges, &amp;c, including film shows, talks and loans of periodicals andbooks, music, &amp;c.: co-operation with the local Ministry of education in regard to these matters.(V) Centre for British examinations (Cambridge University English examiria-tions and Others; some professional examinations); general arrange-. ments, invigilation, return of papers, &amp;c.(vi) British schools, where existing; membership of Boards of Governors,general advice, supervision of expenditure of subsidy if granted, help with recruitment of staff.(vii) Supervision of British holders of Council-subsidised university posts,if any.(viii) Tours and contacts for visiting lecturers and experts sent by the council from the United Kingdom. Dealing with other visiting; British who may help by lecturing, &amp;c, or ask for local contacts or merely examinethe Councils work; visits from members of Parliament and visitingBritish Delegations.(ix) Enquiries from persons wishing to produce British plays at their own expense (e.g., the management of the local national theatre) or translateor publish British books, verify references to the United Kingdom inbooks or perform British music; advice to these on royalties, performingrights, methods of production, &amp;c; arranging reviews of British books,local publications of translations, sale of Council publications, exchanges of British and local learned journals.(x) Replies to miscellaneous enquiries for advice on educational matters andBritish practice generally; local government, science, medicine,administration of justice, industrial welfare, &amp;c. Acting as a link between foreign specialists and their British opposite numbers,e.g., advising enquirers who are the leading British experts on some particular question.  Less of the same service for British experts.(xi) Relations with local anglophile societies; sustaining them with talks, films,periodicals, &amp;c. (In some countries, these are&quot; numerous, eg uo to80 in Sweden-35 in Italy.) 5    &quot;(xii) Efforts to enlist help of members of local British community.(xiii) Arrangements for occasional British Council dramatic tours, exhibitionsconcerts.
(xiv) Co-operation with Commonwealth Missions, e.g., the Indian ambassador in Rangoon has lectured for the Council; the Council in Oslo worksclosely with the Canadian Mission.12. The CounciFs work overseas thus consists of a large number of smalloperations. The general liaison and enquiry work goes on in the day-time, mostof the Centre and lecturing work in the evenings. The kind of person with whom a representative has to be on good terms varies from Cabinet Ministers anduniversity rectors to school teachers, poets and policemen. The number of UnitedKingdom staff varies. There are fourteen in India. The average for an importantcountry is perhaps about seven: in sixteen countries there is only one, and ineighteen less than four. There are, of course, some foreign countries where thearrangements are quite different from those mentioned in the preceding paragraphs.For example, in Afghanistan the Council has only the Principal and two teachers in the leading secondary school, and in Ethiopia the Headmaster and five teachers in the only secondary school. In Beirut the Council runs a hostel for the pickof the Arab students at the American (in practice Anglo-American) University and provides three professors. The work in most Colonial territories and in the oldDominions is also different in many respects see Parts IV and V.Overseas Visitors in the United Kingdom13. A description of the CounciFs work abroad is incomplete without afurther reference to the work of Home Division in the United Kingdom. Thereis no better way of influencing a foreigner than by bringing him to this countryto see for himself or looking after him while he is here. Home Divisions work is therefore strictly complementary to the work abroad. In this field the foreign and Colonial work meet, since the welfare of Colonial students and programmesarranged for Colonial visitors form a substantial part of the Division^ work. InLondon the Division is responsible for the grant of British Council postgraduatescholarships (243 in 1951-52) and of bursaries for industrial and short term training(163): for the arrangement of short courses for overseas visitors, the majority ofwhom pay fees, and self-supporting study tours; for general student welfarearrangements; and for individual visitors (788) who are either sponsored by theCouncil or recommended to the Council by overseas governments or institutionsor British Government departments. Less than eighteen per cent, of these visitorsare paid for or assisted financially by the Council. Many (337 in 1951-52) arethe holders of various forms of United Nations or Colombo Plan fellowships.The Council is a recognised agent of the United Nations and the United NationsSpecialised Agencies for the administration of fellowships tenable in the UnitedKingdom. Excluding Colonial students and others, many thousands of whommade use of students&apos; welfare facilities, the London departments handled in 1951-523,709 individuals; of these 747 were interested in education, 998 in medicine and science and 868 in social science.14. To perform its duties to students and visitors, the Council maintains a regional organisation with representatives in Scotland and Wales and a number of area officers in England. Small centres are maintained in many of the universitycities of the United Kingdom and several hostels for Colonial students, for whosewelfare the Council is responsible. Scholarship holders are intentionally not con-fined to Oxford, Cambridge and London but divided throughout the universities.Courses are held so far as possible outside London and visitors are similarlydistributed.15. As overseas, there is great variety in the CounciFs customers : distinguishedEuropean scientists and men of letters, African chiefs, Turkish mayors, Greekprefects, Japanese ministers and great numbers of officials, teachers, students and experts of various kinds. The welfare of about 6,000 Colonial students involves anumber of special duties. Over 2,000 per annum are met on arrival at the ports.They are found lodgings or housed in hostels, initiated into unfamiliar conditionsof living, their health is looked after, private hospitality is arranged for them inBritish homes, they attend Council centres and vacation courses and are broughtinto contact with, or have explained to them, many aspects of British life.Supply Services for Overseas16.   The services provided from London in aid of the work abroad includethe sending of British experts on lecture tours and advisory visits and the organisa-&quot; tion of drama, ballet and musical tours and visits. So far as material is concerned,
they include the organisation of exhibitions, mainly of the fine arts and books,, andthe provision of books, periodicals and music for Council libraries or books for review in overseas journals and of educational material such as textbooks, visualaids, speech records and so on. It should be noted that the Council is the onlybody provided with public funds for the presentation abroad of British achieve-ments in the fine arts, music and drama. Information is also provided in answer to the very large number of enquiries from overseas specialists referred to london by the CounciFs representatives abroad. A certain number of publications are issued by the&apos;Council, including the British Medical Bulletin. In the subjectscovered by the various specialist departments in London the Council is advised by a number of advisory committees and panels of experts, for instance, on books and publishing, science, medicine, agriculture and law as well as on music, dramaand fine arts.
