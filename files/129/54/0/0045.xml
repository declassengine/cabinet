(THECUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY ^--GOVERNMENT)secret.(52) 295 COPY NO. lp10TH SEPTEMBER, 1952CABINETPERSIA:  OILMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffaireDr. Musaddiq!s ConditionsDr. Musaddiq has recently made a Press statement criticising theAnglo-American proposals for an oil settlement.   He has also sent messages to Her Majesty&apos;s Government through the Italian Ambassador,   He has had inter-views with H.M. Charge d&apos;Affaires, Mr. Middleton, and the American ambassador in which he has stated the only conditions on which he is prepared to make asettlement.   Apart from a number of charges and suspicions that we are forcingthe Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.) into the position of a monopoly purchaser,Dr. Musaddiq&apos;s main points are as follows:(i) that the Hague Court has clearly shown the dispute to be an internalmatter.   The appropriate forum therefore to discuss Persiancompensation is the Persian courts.   However, he is prepared toagree to arbitration on compensation by the Hague Court as a concession, but only on certain conditions, viz:-(a) that the arbitration is confined to compensation for loss of assets and of the oil in storage at the time of nationalisation;(b) that there is prior agreement between the parties clearlydefining and limiting the questions for arbitration, which mustcontain no reference to the 1933 Concession or to the company&apos;legal position prior to nationalisation, but which will includesubstantive and detailed Persian counter-claims;(ii)  an immediate demand for  50 millions allegedly owed by the company,which he now wants in dollars from the A.I.O.C., but would also accept as a grant, gift or advance against oil.   In effect he is making this acondition for agreeing to any negotiations.   He said he would not accept American aid.2. Dr. Musaddiq asked Mr. Middleton to transmit these conditionsurgently to Her Majesty&apos;s Government and said that, if there was a chance ofour acceptance, he would postpone the Majlis meeting, then due on Friday, 12th Sep-tember.   He asked to see Mr. Middleton again on 9th September0   Mr. Middletonwas informed that we would wish to consult the Americans and could not send himinstructions for his interview on the 9th, but that, as there seemed to be no possibility of our accepting Musaddiq&apos;s conditions, there was no point in trying to postpone the Majlis meeting.   The United States Embassy was informed of these instructions,   A Persian spokesman has since stated that the Majlis meeting will &apos;be postponed until next week to allow the President of the Chamber (Kashani) to be present,
2)ioMajesty&apos;s Government^ Position3. Musaddiq&apos;s conditions are quite unacceptable.   In fact they arestiffer than any he has previously made.   It is clear that he will never agree toan arbitration formula on compensation which does not explicitly limitcompensation to loss of assets only and preclude discussion of the validity ofthe 1933 Concession or the Nationalisation Law.   Nevertheless, the Americansmay well press us to modify the formula in the Truman/Churchill proposal inorder to meet Musaddiq&apos;s point.   They may even urge us to agree to compensationfor assets only on the grounds that this should be big enough to satisfy thecompany and discourage other would-be nationalisers.4. We can never accept a formula which, by admitting that the company had no claim to damages for the loss of the Concession and future profits, wouldbe tantamount to admitting Persia&apos;s right to terminate unilaterally the company&apos;sconcession and would have serious effects on all concession agreements elsewhere,besides depriving the company of its just claims.   Indeed, it would be folly to try to modify the Truman/Chur chill formula, which was carefully drafted so as not to prejudice our main principles while representing the maximum concessionswe can make.   If we start tinkering with it in order to meet Musaddiq, we shall find ourselves in the end forced into complete capitulation and acceptance of histerms.5. We should therefore make it clear to Dr. Musaddiq that we are notprepared to accept his conditions.   We should also explain to the Americans thatwe cannot modify the joint proposals and we should make every endeavour to persuade them to stand firm.   We are in a strong position vis-a-vis the americans since they have made these joint proposals which they publiclyrecognise to be as fair and generous as Persia can expect.   But the Americanfear of Communism in Persia and their own electoral considerations will nodoubt make them restless again and they may press us to do something positiveto reach a settlement.6. Dr. Musaddiq for his part is under the pressure of his own extremists.He may well feel obliged to carry out his threat to break off diplomatic relationswith Her Majesty&apos;s Government if the Majlis and Senate give him firm support in rejecting our proposals.7, In my view we have no alternative but to face these two risks.   Wemust stand on t .e Truman-Churchill proposals and make it clear to Dr. Musaddiqthat the consequences of their rejection will be the responsibility of Persia.Any attempt to put forward new suggestions now would only weaken our positionstill further and offer Dr. Musaddiq further opportunities of black-mail.  Atthe same time it is of the utmost importance to keep the Americans firm if wecan.   In the first place we should inform them that we cannot add to the Truman-Churchill proposals and that we earnestly hope they will not press us to do so.We should also make it clear that it would have a very grave effect on Anglo-American relations if they were to break away from the common front which wehave reached with thern in regard to the oil dispute,8. It is quite possible that the Majlis and Senate, while rejecting our proposals, may recommend counter-proposals based on Dr, Musaddiq^conditions referred to above.   In that event it will be important that we shouldmake it known at once that such suggestions can in no way be regarded ascounter-proposals and that they cannot be considered.9. I have considered whether we ought to counter Dr, Musaddiq&apos;recent press statement by some further explanation of our own proposals,
refuting his interpretation of t em.   On the whole I think it unlikely that any official statement now would affect the Majlis&apos; vote.   Indeed it might only serve to enable Dr. Musa^ddiq to arouse further indignation in Persia.   I proposetherefore that we should continue to keep British Information Services currentlybriefed but not issue any official statement.   I should add that Mr, Stokes&apos;sletter to The Times of 6th September was most damaging to our cause and hasalready been favourably cited in the Persian press.   Material has been madeavailable to influential sections of the HHl&amp;Sl&amp;iH press for an inspired article torefute Mr. Stokes&apos;s arguments.Conclusions10. Mr. Middleton should be instructed to inform Dr. Musaddiq thatwe are not prepared to accept his conditions and that responsibility for theconsequences of rejecting the joint proposals will lie with Persia.11. We should inform the United States Government that we cannotmodify the joint proposals and that we earnestly hope they too will stand by them.12. That we should not attempt any official statement in explanation ofour proposals,13. That in the event of the Majlis and Senate recommending counter^proposals based on conditions recently put forward by Dr. Musaddiq we should at once make it known that we cannot regard such suggestions as counter-proposals and that they cannot be considered.A.E.Foreign Office, S. W.1,,
