GERMANY-REPLY TO  SOVIET NOTEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs think my colleagues would like to see the attached draft of the proposed replyto the latest Soviet note on Germany.This draft has been agreed by a tripartite official group in London and Ihave approved it for Her Majesty&apos;s Government. It remains to have american and French clearance. I still await the views of the United States and french governments, after which we shall have to consult Dr. Adenauer before the replycan be delivered in Moscow.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,10th September, 1952.DRAFT REPLY TO SOVIET NOTE ON GERMANYHer Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have carefully consideredthe Soviet Governments note of 23rd August about Germany. They had hopedthat it would have marked some progress towards agreement on the essentialquestion of free all-German elections. This must first be settled between the four powers so that Germany can be unified, an all-German Government formed and a peace treaty concluded.2. Possibly in order to divert attention from this issue, the greater part ofthe Soviet note of 23rd August is, however, devoted to unfounded attacks uponthe Atlantic Pact, the European Defence Community and the Conventions signed at Bonn on 27th May. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention of entering into controversy with the Soviet Government on these questions, since their attitudehas been clearly stated on many occasions. As they have often emphasised, these agreements are purely defensive and threaten no one. The Bonn Conventions andthe European Defence Community Treaty, far from being imposed on the Germanpeople and from maintaining them in a state of subservience, are a matter for freediscussion and decision by freely-elected Parliaments, including, of course, that ofthe German Federal Republic. In so far as the Bonn Conventions reserve certainstrictly limited rights to the three Western Powers, the sole object is to safeguard the principle of German unity and to keep the door open for agreement with theSoviet Union on the unification of Germany. Facts speak for themselves and her majesty&apos;s Government do not for their part fear an impartial enquiry into con-ditions throughout Germany.3. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have noted with the deepest regret that, underthe guise of presenting constructive proposals, the Soviet note of 23rd August hasin one very important respect gone back upon earlier Soviet proposals.   In its42891( )SECRET Copy No.   n iC (52) 29610th September, 1952.CABINET &apos;
original note of 10th March, the Soviet Government stated, &quot;naturally such-tgpeace treaty must be drafted with the direct participation of an all-German Govern-&apos;ment&quot; and in the Soviet draft Peace Treaty attached as an appendix to that notethey further asserted that &quot;the preparation of the peace treaty should be effectedwith the participation of Germany in the form of an all-German Government.&quot;This was in complete accord with the views of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, theFrench and United States Governments. In neither of its two following notes did the Soviet Government imply that it intended to withdraw from this position, whichwas indeed consonant with the statements made over a period of years by theSoviet representative in the Council of Foreign Ministers.&apos; In now proposing iodiscuss the peace treaty before the formation of an all-German Government; theSoviet Government have completely shifted their ground, thus calling in questionwhat appeared to have been agreed. At the same time they have reverted to the potsdam decisions. But Her Majesty&apos;s Government, whose views on the Potsdamdecisions have been set out in their previous notes, are compelled to remind theSoviet Government that conditions have radically changed since 1945 and the ideaof a peace treaty drawn up by the Four Powers and imposed by them on germany is entirely unsuitable in 1952. The Soviet Government will also recall that the potsdam Agreement itself stated that its political and economic arrangements were designed to govern the initial control period only. Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould never agree to a peace treaty being drafted or negotiated without the partici-pation of an all-German Government. Any other procedure would turn such atreaty into a &quot; diktat.&quot;  That indeed would be &quot; an insult to the German nation.&quot;4. The Soviet Government have instead suggested that East Germanrepresentatives as well as representatives of the German Federal Republic should&quot; take part in the (Four-Power) Conference during the discussion of relevantquestions.&quot; Her Ma,jesty&apos;s Government must at once state that they are not pre-pared to accept such a proposal as a substitute for the participation of an all-German Government in the negotiations. They cannot conceive that a peace treaty for the whole of Germany could be negotiated with and accepted by any Germanrepresentatives other than the all-German Government which would have to carry it out. Such a Government can only proceed from free elections. In any case,Her Majesty&apos;s Government cannot regard representatives of the &quot; german democratic Republic &quot; as expressing the will of the East German population.Leaving aside the circumstances in which the &quot; German Democratic Republic &quot;was set up and its &quot; Government&quot; appointed, Her Majesty&apos;s Government havebeen shocked by the. statement in the Soviet note of 23rd August that the measuresrecently enforced by the East German Authorities to prevent contact betweenGermans, and so further divide Germany, were taken &quot; at the request of thepopulation.&quot; This assertion alone disposes of any serious claim on the part ofthe East German Authorities to represent any significant section of the Germanpeople, since it is well known that the first desire of all Germans is unity in freedom.5. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are therefore brought back again to the funda-mental question of free elections. They are at a loss to understand the SovietGovernment^ position. The original Soviet note of 10th March made no mentionwhatever of free elections. In their reply of 25th March Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment stated that the conclusion of a peace treaty for Germany required theformation of an all-German Government, which could only be set up on the basisof free elections. The Soviet Government, in their reply of 9th April, concededthat it was necessary that the Four Powers should &quot; discuss without delay thequestion of holding free all-German elections.&quot; They went on to say that &quot; the recognition by the Government of the U.S.S.R., Great Britain, the United Statesand France of the need to hold free all-German elections creates the full possibilityfor holding such elections in the immediate future.&quot; Thus some progress seemedto have been made also on this issue, although the actual proposal in the last paragraph of this Soviet note again made no mention of free all-German elections and suggested only that the four Governments should examine &quot; a peace treaty with Germany as well as the question of unification of Germany and the establish-ment of an all-German Government.&quot; Nevertheless, in their note of 13th May,Her Majesty&apos;s Government put forward a precise scheme for an impartial corn-mission to investigate electoral conditions throughout Germany as the necessary&apos;prerequisite, to the holding of free all-German elections. Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere therefore surprised and disappointed by the further Soviet note of 24th May,since the Soviet Governmenfs proposal, contained in the concluding section of
L^is note, again avoided all mention of free all-German elections. In their note of 10th July Her Majesty&apos;s Government were therefore obliged once again toexplain the vital importance which they attach to this essential question. Theyconcluded by making definite proposals for the discussion between the Four Powersof the holding of free elections, the formation of an all-German Government andthe negotiation of a peace treaty with that Government in that order, since that order alone could produce early and effective results.6. In their latest.note of 23rd August the Soviet Government have yet againevaded this central issue. While the Soviet Government state that they are pre-pared to discuss &quot; the holding of free all-German elections and the setting, up ofa Commission to verify the existence of conditions in Germany for holding suchelections, its composition and functions,&quot; they are still not ready to settle first thingsfirst. Instead, they deem it necessary that the Four-Power Conference &quot; should discuss in the first place such important issues as a peace treaty with Germanyand the formation of an all-German Government/&apos; It therefore now seems clearthat, in the Soviet Governments view, the negotiation of a peace treaty and theformation of an all-German Government should precede free all-German elections.This is impossible for the simple reason that until elections are held, no all-GermanGovernment can be formed nor can the country be unified; and until an all-German Government is formed and given the necessary freedom of action, it isuseless to discuss the terms of a German peace treaty.7. For the following reasons also, Her Majesty&apos;s Government insist thatgenuinely free elections with a view to the formation of an all-German government must come first. Over the past seven years there has been agreement between thethree Western Governments and the Soviet Government that a united germany should be &quot; peace-loving, democratic and independent.&quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have learned by hard experience in recent years that these terms have onemeaning in common parlance and another in the official Soviet vocabulary. Sovietofficial pronouncements appear to reserve the word &quot; democratic &quot; exclusively for those societies in which the Communists have a monopoly of political power.Similarly, the term &quot; peace-loving &quot; is applied only to Soviet Communist policies and those who follow them, while anything which implies resistance to such policiesis labelled as warlike and aggressive. The words &quot; free &quot; and &quot; independent &quot; are used to describe States with the outward trappings of sovereignty but actually ina condition of subjection to the Soviet Union. The different interpretation of these terms, as laid down for Germany in the Potsdam Agreement, is illustrated by thecontrasting results of their application in Eastern and Western Germany. In theSoviet Zone, and indeed in the neighbouring &quot; popular democracies &quot; of eastern europe, &quot; freedom &quot; means forced labour, deportations, arbitrary imprisonmentwithout trial, and all the other manifestations of the police State. In these terri-tories &quot; free elections &quot; have hitherto meant &quot; freedom &quot; for the electorate to casta 98 per cent, or 99 per cent, vote in favour of an official single list. It is for theGerman people to choose between these alternative ways of life. But they mustbe able to make their choice in genuine freedom and full responsibility. Onlygenuinely free elections can reflect the will of the German people and permit theformation of an all-German Government with the necessary freedom of action todiscuss and to accept a peace settlement.8. Her Majesty&apos;s Government therefore now turn to the question of thecommission of investigation, having noted that the Soviet Government still agree on the necessity for such a body. The Soviet Government have, however, made anew proposal that this Commission should be composed of representatives of thePeople&apos;s Assembly of the German Democratic Republic and of the Bundestagof the German Federal Republic. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have previouslymaintained that such a Commission, if it is to achieve useful results, should begenuinely independent, objective and impartial. They cannot but consider that aGerman Commission would be no more able than a Four-Power Commission tomeet this requirement. Her Majesty&apos;s Government, moreover, would point outthat the Soviet Governments present proposal is similar to one made by HerrGrotewohl on 15th December, 1951. This was rejected by the Bundestag, whichthen put forward the idea of an investigation by an impartial United nations commission. It was thus the freely elected representatives of 50 millions of theGerman people who themselves proposed the creation of a neutral InvestigationCommission under United Nations supervision.   Nevertheless, Her Majesty&apos;s
Government remain ready to discuss any practical and precise proposals relate   .to the composition, functions and authority of the Commission of Investigation inaccordance with their note of 10th July.9. Her Majesty&apos;s Government therefore renew the proposal made in their note of 10th July for an early Four-Power meeting which could take place in or before October to discuss the immediate problem of the formation, functions and authority of an impartial Commission of Investigation to determine whether theconditions necessary for free elections exist. The next step would be to discussarrangements for the holding of these elections and for the formation of an all-German Government, as proposed in paragraph 11 (iv) of their note of 13th May.When free elections have taken place and an all-German Government has beenformed, the peace settlement, including, of course, the question of the date of thewithdrawal of Occupation Forces from Germany, can be negotiated. Her iMajesty&apos;sGovernment most earnestly urge the Soviet Government to reconsider its refusal to join the other Powers in a single-minded effort to come to grips with the problemof holding free elections in Germany.
