Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1952SECRET Copy No. 6 8C. (52) 28215th August, 1952CABINETAMENDMENT OF THE TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING ACT, 1947Memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government1. The Cabinet at their meeting on 31st July, 1952 (C.C. (52) 75th Meeting,Minute 2) invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself to bring before themfor early decision the question of amendment of the financial provisions of theTown and Country Planning Act. We have had further discussions, but we havenot been able to reach agreement.  This paper sets out very briefly our two views.2. We are agreed that whatever else is done the Act should be amended toprovide that the  300 million should not be distributed next year. Individual claimsshould be paid only as and when permission to develop is refused or land is com-pulsorily acquired.3. We are also agreed that claims when they have to be paid should be paid at their face value, and should not be written down to 80 per cent., which would bethe effect on most of them of distributing the  300 million outright.4. Our difference arises over development charge. My scheme (see C. (52)228) provides for abolition of charge. I would abandon the theory that develop-ment values vest in the State; would treat the payment of claims as compensation to owners for not being allowed to develop their land (though excluding any rightto compensation for a wide range of &quot; good neighbour &quot; restrictions); and would leave owners who are allowed to develop, free to do so without charge. Whereland is compulsorily purchased I would pay only the current existing use value plus the claim.5. The Chancellor, on the other hand, believes that the basis of the present act ought to be retained; but would agree that charge might be reduced, perhaps to a figure of 60 per cent. He would pay all claims in full as planning permissionwas refused or the land compulsorily acquired, and would accept them in settlementof the 60 per cent, charge up to 60 per cent, of their face value.6.   My reasons for preferring to abolish charge are two.First, charge is, in part at any rate, a burden on development. Except wherecompulsory powers are used, land is not sold for development at existing use value,and in my view never will be. To the extent that the owner gets more out of thedeveloper than existing use value he passes the burden of charge on to the developer.This is very serious for private housing; and retention of charge will, I believe, makeit impossible to achieve the switch from subsidised to private enterprise housingwhich I want. Further, since the theory of the Act demands that land shouldchange hands at existing use value, and the Central Land Board have power toenforce this, little land is being offered for development or re-development at all;and the more we try to encourage private development the more serious this will be.Second, charge is widely disliked. It is regarded as a tax, which not only addsto the cost of development, but is uncertain in amount, and falls to be paid at the worst possible moment, just when the developer is facing the cost of development.To the extent that the deferment of claims will result in setting off charges againstclaims the objections to charge will be reduced; but since deferment necessarilybrings charge and claim together, charge will seem particularly unfair where it42773
exceeds claim. And unless it is going to exceed claim in a good many cases there seems to be small point in keeping it.7. The criticisms that can be made of my scheme are that it leaves the ownerswho are allowed to develop, free to pocket their &quot; unearned increment&quot; on sale;and it results in inequality between these owners and owners who are refused per-mission or whose land is compulsorily acquired. I would propose that localauthorities should be encouraged to use their powers of compulsory purchase onbehalf of private developers in order to check exploitation by the owners wherethe plans made by the authorities severely limit the amount of land which canbe developed at all; but this would be a remedy of limited application.8. The Chancellor prefers to retain the general structure of the Act, and to diminish its defects by making the development charge more flexible. He would,therefore, retain charge but assess it at a proportion only of the development value.The proportion suggested is 60 per cent, and this could be varied up or down infuture in the light of experience. He takes this view partly because the return ofall development values to owners might well bring land back into the field ofpolitical controversy, but partly also because he fears that the inequality under my proposals between owners allowed to develop their land and owners not so allowed,or dispossessed, would not long be tolerated, and would lead to strong pressure to restore equality by increase of compensation above the level of the claims on1947 values under the Act. There would be some inequality under his proposals,in that the reduction of charge to 60 per cent, would allow the &quot; free &quot; owners tokeep 40 per cent, of their development value and indeed as much more as theycould persuade developers to pay; but it would be less than under mine.9. The criticism that can be made of this scheme is that it is a half-way house.It does not achieve complete equality between owners or prevent owners fromrealising some &quot; unearned increment.&quot; Meanwhile it keeps charge, which is causinga very large volume of complaint. I do not believe that the complaint will be appreciably less if charge is reduced; it is a complaint against having to pay it at all.10. The question, therefore, is whether we are to keep charge, in whole orin part, or to abolish it. Once we can get a decision on this, a scheme can be worked out.H. M.15th August, 1952.
