m(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(52) 263 COPY NO. jjT26TH JULY, 1952CABINETPRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES FOR INTERNATIONALORGANISATIONSMemorandum by the Attorney-general at the meeting of the Cabinet on the 24th June (C. C. (52) 62ndConclusions, Minute 6(2)), the Lord Chancellor and I were asked to considerwhether the Government are committed by agreements to which they areparties to accord the prescribed privileges and immunities to the organisations listed in Annex III to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper c. (52) 191.The organisations are:-(a) Specialised Agencies of the United Nations:-Universal Postal union the International Telecommunication union the World Health organisation the World Meteorological organisation the Maritime Consultative organisation the International Trade Organisation(b) Other organisations:-North Atlantic Treaty OrganisationEuropean Payments UnionInternational Wheat CouncilCustoms Co-operation council. While appreciating that diplomatic or political questions may arise,I think that, as a Law Officer, I can usefully advise only on the questionwhether the Government are committed in the sense that they are under a legal obligation imposed by international law to accord the relevant privileges and immunities,3. The Specialised AgenciesOur obligations towards the specialised agencies arise under:-(a) The International Convention on Privileges and Immunities for the specialised Agencies of the United Nations (Cmd. 7673);(b) The Agreements establishing the Agencies.
1(3(l)  The International convention the combined effect of section 46 of the Convention and section 4 ofthe Diplomatic Privileges (International Organisations) Act, 1950, is thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government cannot accede to the Convention in respectof any agency until an Order-in-Council, requiring an affirmative resolution of both Houses, has been made according the relevant privilegeseThere is, in my view, no obligation under the Convention to accord privilegesto the Universal Postal Union, the International Telecommunication Union orthe World Health Organisation, because there has been no accession to theConvention in respect of these Agencies.   No State is bound by any agreement which it has not ratified and each accession to the Conventioneffects ratification pro tanto.(2) The Agreements(a) The Agreements establishing the Universal Postal Union and theInternational Telecommunication Union contain no provisions for conferring privileges and immunities and are thereforeimmaterial.(b) The Agreement establishing the World Meteorological Organisationprovides that the Organisation, its officials and representativesof its members shall enjoy the privileges set out in a separate agreement.   The Agreement has been ratified by Her majesty&apos;s government and I understand that the separate agreement referred tohas been concluded in the form of an annex to the 1947 Convention.If that is so, then Her Majesty&apos;s Government are in my opinionlegally bound to accord to the Organisation the privilegesprescribed in this annex.(c) The Agreement establishing the Inter-Governmental maritime consultative Organisation provides for the grant, pendingaccession to the 1947 Convention, of the privileges set out inAppendix 2 to the Agreement.   This Agreement has been ratified and Her Majesty&apos;s Government are therefore bound togrant the privileges set out in this Appendix.(3) I understand that the International Trade Organisation is nowunlikely to come into existence and it may therefore be ignored.4. Other organisations the position with regard to the other organisations is, in my view,equally clear.   Her Majesty&apos;s Government are legally bound to grant the privileges specified in Article XIII, paragraph 21, and Article XVII, paragraph 7,of the International &quot;Wheat Agreement, which has been ratified.   TheAgreements relating to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, theEuropean Payments Union and the Customs Co-operation Council have not been ratified and Her Majesty&apos;s Government are under no obligation to accord the privileges and immunities specified in those agreements.5. Conclusions(l)    Her Majesty&apos;s Government are under no legal obligation in respectof the World Health Organisation, the Universal Postal Union, the InternationalTelecommunication Union or the International Trade Organisation.
(2)    Her Majesty^ Government are at present under no legal obligationin regard to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the European payments union or the Customs Co-operation Council, but a binding obligationwould arise in each case if the relevant agreement were ratified.(3)    Her Majesty&apos;s Government are under a legal obligation to accordprivileges and immunities to:-(i)  The World Meteorological Organisation;(ii)  The Inter &quot;Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation;(iii)  The International Wheat Council.L.H.Law Officers&apos; Department, W.
