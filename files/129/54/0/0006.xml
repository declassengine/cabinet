CONFIDENTIAL.C. (52) 25623rd JULY, 1952.TEXTILE IMPORTS FROM CZECHOSLOVAKIA&apos;&apos;. Memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeConsiderable apprehension has been expressed in the House ofCommons arid elsewhere about the size of the quotas for textile imports from czechoslovakia which have been the subject of negotiations recently in Prague.I should therefore like my colleagues to have before them the basic facts of theposition and the lines on which I propose to seek a settlement with the Czechs.2. The negotiations are to settle the quotas under the IV -3 year TradeandFinancial Agreement concluded in 1949, for the trade both ways betweenCzechoslovakia and ourselves during the next twelve months.   The agreement is one of advantage both to Czechoslovakia and ourselves.   Under it we get anannual payment of  3 millions in settlement of debts incurred by the pre-Communist Government of Czechoslovakia.   This is an important provision andis the one instance of a regular payment of a pre-Communist debt by aGovernment in the Soviet bloc.  In addition to this payment the Czechs buy goods from the United Kingdom (agreed with us) to the value of  1 5 millions, and rawmaterials from the sterling area.   On the other side the Czechs are undercommitment to send us certain essential commodities such as sugar, bristles,oilseeds, softwood, while we undertake to buy &quot;less essentials&quot; from them to a value  of  5^ millions.   The annex .to this memorandum summarises the basisof the arrangements for 1952/53 as provisionally negotiated in Prague.3. Textiles and apparel are among the traditional exports from czechoslovakia to this country, and quotas for these have been accorded in eachyear of the agreement.   But we have been at pains in this year&apos;s negotiationto reduce the quotas for &quot;less essentials&quot; from Czechoslovakia having regardto the reduced global quotas now in operation for Western European countries.The quota for textile piece good? was  1,180,000 in 1950/51: this was reducedto  300,000 in 1951/52 and this figure was provisionally agreed again for1952/53.   The quota for apparel was  775,000 in 1951/52 and is now put at 370,000 for 1952/53.  A quota of  300,000 for textile piece goods wouldbe equivalent to only lg% of the annual rate at which piece goods imports are being currently licensed from Western Europe, and to a still smallerpercentage of piece goods from all sources.   On the other side of the pictureour own quotas for textile exports to Czechoslovakia have been provisionallyagreed at an overall figure of  350,000 as compared with  165,000 in 1951/52,including an important new quota for rayon yarn.4, During the last few days I instructed our delegation in Prague to seek to eliminate altogether the quota for imports here of textile piece goods.The Czechs have, not unexpectedly, refused to agree to this, but have said thatthey would be prepared to agree to a reduction of  100,000 or even  150,000 inthe provisionally agreed quota of  300,000 provided that compensating increasesCABINET OFFiCt copy no..RECORD copy cabinet
S&amp;re given on quotas for other imports such as fondant and sugar fat.  I should**liope tai avoid having to concede increases in the import quotas for these twocommodities, but to be able to find some other items acceptable to the Czechsand to ourselves,5. I am clear that if we refused to license the import of any textilepiece goods from Czechoslovakia in 1952/53, we should run a very real risk of losing an agreement which is of definite value to our balance of payments ...-position, giving us, as it does, useful goods in return for repayment of olddebts.  And given the facts, as set out in paragraph 3, about the sharp reductionin Czech textile quotas and the increase in our own, I think that a.compromise on the basis of the Czech reply to pur latest proposal can be defended asentirely reasonable.  I accordingly recommend that I should be authorised tosettle the negotiations on the basis of securing a reduction of  l00,000/ 150j000in the piece goods quota with corresponding increases in the quotas, for other&quot;less essential&quot; imports. &apos;. &apos;6. If matters are settled on this basis I should hope to be able to make an announcement in the House (including a full statement on the textile position) onsay, the 29th July.7. I would add that it has proved virtually impossible to check the accuracy of the statements&apos;about the &quot;dumping&quot; here of textiles in recent weeksby the czechs,  There is some evidence that certain quantities of seersuckercloth have been offered and bought in London recently at prices which, allowing for qualities, are somewhat lower than the run of comparable prices of UnitedKingdom, French and German cloths.   But the fact is that there is inevitablya fair amount of weak selling of textiles at the present time; and while there maywell have been some Czech selling at low prices, I am sure that it would be a mistake to allow this to influence our judgment on the wider issue of continuing toagree to a limited volume of textile imports in order to maintain the Trade andFinancial Agreement as a whole.P.T.Board of Trade, 5.W.I.23rd July, 1952.
