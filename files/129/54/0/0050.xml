I;! . jj(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(52) 300 COPY NO._ ^16th SEPTEMBER, 1952.CABINETNEGOTIATIONS WITH ARGENTINANote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I circulate herewith a report by the Overseas Negotiations Committeeon the latest position in the Argentine negotiations.   It is important to get anearly Cabinet decision on the main issue involved.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.16th September, 1952.NEGOTIATIONS WITH ARGENTINAReport by the Overseas Negotiations CommitteeThe Cabinet agreed on the 13th May &quot;that the Governments aim in thecurrent negotiations on meat imports from South America should be to secureall the meat which could be made available provided that reasonable prices could be negotiated&quot;. (C.C.(52) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 5).2. On the 7th August Argentina made comprehensive proposalsincluding an offer of 250,000 tons of all types of carcase meat with a price forfrozen &quot;A&quot; beef of  180 per ton.   They requested that Article 12 of last year&apos;sProtocol should be renewed.   This Article included an undertaking to convertArgentine sterling balances above approximately  20 millions into dollarsas well as the following credit provisions:&quot;The United Kingdom Government agree that whenever the sterling balances of the /Argentine/ Central Bank are not sufficient to meetpayments to the Scheduled Territories they will make sterlingavailable tc the Argentine Government up to  20 millions on terms to be agreed between the two Governments. &quot;
3. On the 22nd August our negotiators in Buenos Aires put in counter&quot;proposals, including   an offer to take 140,000 tons of frozen beef, lamb and^offals, but no mutton or pork, with a price of  145 per ton of frosen &quot;A&quot; beef.They hinted that we might be able to buy as much as 160,000 tons.   they refused to renew the credit provisions of Article 12 but offered Argentina theright to recapture any dollars sold to the Bank of England after the conclusionof a new agreement in order to acquire sterling.4, Argentina has now replied formally to our counter proposals andhas stated that no effective agreement can be reached without renewal of the credit provisions.   Our Ambassador (who is leading the United Kingdomnegotiations) sees no hope whatever of shifting Argentina from this position andfears that lack of progress now will lead to a progressive deterioration ofatmosphere and probably a repetition of the 1950-51 deadlock.   On the otherhand extension of the credit provisions of the 1951 Protocol would pave theway for an early settlement on meat and other matters.   He reports that, ratherthan accept our terms, Argentina is   prepared to wait indefinitely and seewhose staying power fails first.   They have earned some sterling recentlyfrom sales of cotton and they have sufficient oil for the time being.   Certainlya prolonged deadlock would have serious consequences for them too, but the argument that we have oa1v- to wait for time to break their resistance&quot;has been proved wrong in the past and it would be a great mistake to rely on it now&quot;.5. A continued state of deadlock in which no meat moves would have serious consequences for us.   Our export trade in manufactured goods would diminish still further and the present improvement in Anglo-Argentinerelations built up so laboriously in the last eighteen months would be dissipated,while failure to secure supplies of South American meat, four-fifths of which comes from Argentina, would lead to a severe reduction in the meat rationearly next year or even earlier.   If these consequences are unacceptable weshall be forced in the end to conclude an agreement.   As time goes on ourbargaining position will deteriorate and we are unlikely to get better terms bydelay.6, The Foreign Office, Board of Trade and Ministry of Food considerthat we shall have to agree in the end to the renewal of the credit provisions inorder to secure a meat agreement at all, and indeed if we are to maintain anytolerable commercial relations with Argentina.   They point out that Argentinahas consistently pressed for the credit provisions throughout the present negotiations and throughout last year&apos;s negotiations and they have never moved from their view that by holding sterling balances they are really giving theUnited Kingdom a credit and that when they are short of sterling they areentitled to be given a credit by the United Kingdom in return.   Similar creditprovisions are a feature of their agreements with other countries, and now that Argentina faces a grave balance of payments crisis and in particular asterling shortage, her Government could not accept failure to secure at least a renewal of the sterling credit facilities granted under the 1951 Protocol.7. The Treasury&apos;s view is that notwithstanding the consequences forecast in paragraph 5 above, we should not accede to the Argentine request for credit.   It is our deliberate policy to make sterling a scarce currency and thesuccess of this policy is reflected in, for example, Argentine sales of cottonto the raw Cotton Commission at reduced prices, Uruguayan reductions in woolprices and Argentine sales of dollars for sterling.   Credit for Argentina,notwithstanding the fact that other countries had no agreement on the lines ofArticle 12 of the 1951 Protocol, can hardly fail to encourage countries in
72hEKE)South America and elsewhere to stand o-ut for similar facilities, thus/&quot;&quot;\putting at risk our whole policy.   In the Treasury&apos;s view, Argentina is not aXJ?country for which an exception to the general policy can safely be made.Ministers have decided -that balance of payments considerations must take precedence and the Treasury consider that in the present critical state ofour reserves, credit is a concession to Argentine principles which we cannot afford.8. The Foreign Office, Board of Trade and Ministry of Food agreethat there is force in the Treasury arguments although they would point outthat the principle of a credit conceded to Argentina in the 1950/51 Protocoldid not have the embarrassing consequences in other countries which were expected at the time.   They feel strongly that if we have got to give way in the end we had better do so sooner than later, when it may cost us much more.All the evidence of the 1950/51 negotiation suggests that this is right.9. The settlement of the credit question would give the negotiations anew impetus and we should expect to reach an agreement on meat before very long, since the Ministry of Food are now prepared to improve on the offersso far made both as regards quantities and prices of meat.   The offer of credit as part of a generally satisfactory agreement would also place us in a stronger position to bargain on the maintenance of our markets in Argentinafor less essentials, though we should not count too much on this, and we might iiope to obtain some satisfaction of the claims of British companiesagainst Argentina.9. We therefore recommend (Treasury dissenting) that our negotiatorsshould now be authorised to offer as part of a generally satisfactory Agreementa renewal of Article 1Z of the 1951 Protocol with such modification in our favour as it may be possible to negotiate.   It should be left to the discretion of H.M. Ambassador at what stage in the negotiations he should make this effer so that the best advantage may be secured from it.15th September, 1952.
