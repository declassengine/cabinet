THE TIMETABLEMemorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations the^decision by the Cabinet on 17th June(C.C.(52) 60th Conclusions, Minute7)   and the acceptance bymost of the commonwealth  /ealth Prime Ministers of the PrimeMinisters invitation to them to come to London for a commonwealth Economic Conference in the second half ofNovember, imposes a very heavy burden of work upon UnitedKingdom Ministers and officials and a very short time inwhich to do it.2.     To allow all Commonwealth Ministers to be home byChristmas we must start the Conference not later than25th November.3.     The Prime.Ministers of Canada, Australia and New Zealandhave emphasised that if the Conference is to succeed time must be allowed for thorough preparation by officials. &apos; Promfour to five weeks are needed for a preparatory meeting of commonwealth officials,h.     Moreover, time must be allowed to enable commonwealth  /ealthofficials who attend the preparatory meeting to return totheir countries before the Conference starts in order toreport fully to their Prime Ministers and to give the lattera chance before leaving for London to consult their Cabinetson the major issues that will arise.-5...   Hence the preparatory meeting of Commonwealth officialsmust end by 25th uctober and must start not later than 22nd September.6.     The United Kingdom official delegation must enter thispreparatory meeting with policy proposals approved by ministers.   Before 22nd September, two sets of decisions will, therfore, be required from us -(a) on the broad objectives to which the UnitedKingdom Government is to seek the concurrence of Commonwealth Governments at the Conference;(b) on the detailed proposals to put to other commonwealth Governments to achieve these;;&apos;    v        objectives.
7*    Only UP Ministers reach decisions on (a) beforeabout the end of July will It be possible for us to keepto this timetable.   Furthermore it will he necessary for united Kingdom officials, in working out detailed proposals under (b), to obtain guidance from us during August andthe first part of September.   We shall have to give finalinstructions, to the United Kingdom official delegation in the third week of September.8.     It will.be necessary to send telegrams on the timetableto Commonwealth Prime Ministers &quot;at the earliest possible moment so that we may have their replies in time to enablean announcement about the Conference to be made in&quot;Parliament.on Tuesday, 29th July.   Before these telegramsare sent, however, I think that Ministers should appreciateand accept the implications in paragraph 7 above.S.Commonwealth Relations office, S.W.I.22ND JULY, 1952
