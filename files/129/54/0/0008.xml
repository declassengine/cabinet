(52) 25823rd July, 1952CABINETDISARMAMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe ProblemA resolution, sponsored by the United Kingdom, France and the United Statesand passed by the last United Nations General Assembly, set up a disarmament commission to prepare proposals to be embodied in a draft Disarmament Treatycovering:-^(a) The disclosure by States of information about their armed forces and armaments and a system Of verification on this disclosure (as a first task).(b) The establishment of a system of control covering both disclosure andverification and the reduction of armed forces and armaments.(c) The reduction of armed forces.(d) The reduction of conventional armaments.(e) The elimination of all major weapons adaptable to mass destruction.(/) Effective international control of atomic energy to ensure the prohibitionof atomic weapons and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposesonly. - &apos; ...- - -The passage of this resolution. was an effective counter to the Soviet campaign in favour of the abolition of atomic weapons and a one-third reduction in armed forces. It constituted a considerable propaganda success for the Western Powers.2. The Disarmament Commission (the members of the Security Council plusCanada) has been meeting periodically in New York since last March. After fixingits plan of work, the Disarmament Commission has received a working papersubmitted by the United States on disclosure and verification ((a) in paragraph 1above), a statement of principles (also from the United States) and, from the UnitedKingdom, United States and French Delegations, a working paper on the reductionof armed forces ((c) in paragraph 1 above). There has, however, been little progress in discussing these papers, because the Soviet Delegate has insisted onhearing proposals first about the abolition of atomic, bacteriological and massdestruction weapons. The papers were annexed, without comment, to the first report of the Commission, which was circulated to members of the United nations in June. The Commission must start preparing its second report about the middleof August and, so far, there is nothing of substance to include in it which was notin the first.3. The two reports of the Commission will be discussed in the next united nations General Assembly in October. If the Western propaganda initiative is tobe maintained, it is clearly desirable to have concrete evidence in the second report against the Soviet allegations that the Western Powers are only preparedto discuss those aspects of Disarmament which would be to their own advantage.4. There are objections to submitting further proposals on the remainingaspects of Disarmament listed in paragraph 1:(i) While we have presented preliminary proposals for the reduction of man-power, a study oh the reduction of conventional armaments ((d) inparagraph 1 above) would raise the question of the relationship betweenreducing men and reducing arms, and would be exceedingly complex.42621b
To adopt a firm stand on this by tabling a paper in the disarmament commission would tie our hands in any ultimate negotiation to &apos;a very Vundesirable extent. Another possible subject for study is the establish- .ment of a system of control ((b) in paragraph.! above); but it would be .illogical and risky to attempt now to define the powers and functionsof a control organ without prior agreement on what it had to control,(ii) Any further steps in these or other directions would only invite the SovietGovernment to fasten on certain aspects of Disarmament, such as theimmediate prohibition of the atomic bomb or weapons of mass,destruction generally, which would put the Western Powers at a.   . disadvantage.5. It is nevertheless desirable for the Western Powers to go on record in someway in the Disarmament Commission to show that they genuinely want Dis-armament in all its aspects, and thus to demonstrate clearly that it is Sovietintransigence which is preventing this. -recommendations. It is accordingly recommended that the United Kingdom Delegate shouldbe instructed, after consultation with his United States colleague, and if possible with his. co-operation, to table the generally-worded working paper which is .annexed. This working paper contains proposals for the form of an eventualDisarmament Treaty, the conclusion of which is&apos;the essential purpose of the Dis-armament Commission. It would thus point the way to the formulation of com-prehensive and co-ordinated proposals which could eventually be embodied inthe Treaty. The advantages of such a paper are that it demonstrates equally thatthe Western Powers are not evading certain aspects of Disarmament and. that theSoviet Union have made no constructive proposals towards it. It would thereforeput action taken so far by the Western Powers in the Disarmament Commissionin its proper perspective, counter the Soviet criticisms, and serve as a basis for aprogress report by the Disarmament Commission. This draft working paperinvolves no commitment for Her Majes&apos;ty&apos;s Government beyond those already undertaken under the General Assembly resolution. The Chiefs of Staff have been associated in its preparation and Sir G. Jebb considers that a paper on these lines would be very useful.Supporting Arguments7. There is no doubt that the Soviet insinuations that the Western powers are evading those aspects of Disarmament least to their advantage are likely tohave some effect on &quot; neutral&quot; Delegations at the General Assembly. The Westernproposals tabled so far cover only a narrow field and, unless this can be justifiedand explained, there may well be a move to produce a &quot; compromise &quot; betweenSoviet and Western views, conceding at least the principle of Soviet demands forthe immediate abolition of atomic and bacteriological weapons.8. While, for the reasons given in paragraph 4 above, we should avoid sub-mjtting further proposals on the detailed aspects of Disarmament, there is evidenceof a general inclination in the Disarmament Commission towards the tabling ofa general paper: for instance (a) The French Delegate, M. Moch, has aired in the Disarmament Corn-mission very detailed proposals for putting Disarmament into effect.Neither we nor the United States were prepared to see these developed,since in our opinion they seriously compromised our position on atomic weapons. M. Moch was only prevented from tabling them by forcefulcriticisms from the United States and United Kingdom Delegates.(b) The Pakistani Delegate, Dr. Azad, has shown to the United Kingdom and united States Delegations a draft, which, while not going so far asthe French proposals, is nevertheless objectionable because it isolatesthe abolition of atomic weapons and in various ways prejudges detailed proposals yet to be agreed upon on the various aspects of Disarmament.By tabling a general paper on the lines recommended we may thus hope to avert something more objectionable.A.

annex draft Working Paper, setting forth Proposals for the Preparation of aDraft Treaty on Disarmament(To be submitted by the United Kingdom Representative on the disarmament commission)IntroductionUnder resolution 502 (VI) of the General Assembly, the disarmament commission is directed to prepare proposals to be embodied in a Draft Treaty (orTreaties) covering the following aspects of Disarmament:-(a) The regulation, limitation and balanced reduction of armed forces.(b) The regulation, limitation and balanced reduction of all armaments.(c) The elimination of all major weapons adaptable to mass destruction..(d) The effective international control of atomic energy to ensure the prohibition-prohibition of atomic weapons and the use of atomic energy for peacefulpurposes only.(e) Progressive disclosure and verification on a continuing basis of all armed forces and all. armaments including atomic (as a first task).(/) An international control organ (or organs) to ensure the implementation of the Treaty (or Treaties).(g) An adequate system of safeguards to ensure observance of the Disarmamentprogramme.(h) By implication, since the resolution speaks of &quot;balanced reduction&quot; and&quot;progressive disclosure and verification,&quot; a time-table, in accordancewith which the other provisions are to be brought into effect.2. It is clearly impossible for the Disarmament Commission to discuss ailthese elements of Disarmament in detail at the same time. As yet the commission has received detailed proposals only on disclosure and verification and on reductionof armed forces, but proposals on all the above-mentioned elements of Disarmamentmust be discussed and agreed before the Commission can complete its tasks.3. It is suggested that the Commission should clarify its intention to coverall these elements by agreeing that each element should be included in an annex to the draft Treaty (or Treaties) which it is the eventual task of the Commissionto prepare. If this suggestion is accepted, the Disarmament Commission could,even at this stage, discuss the form which the draft Treaty (or Treaties) shouldtake in order to link the respective Annexes, as well as to decide on the exacttitles and number of the Annexes.4. If the Commission could thus agree on the form that the Treaty (orTreaties) should take, this would put into their proper perspective the detailed proposals already tabled in the Commission and indicate what subjects should thereafter be discussed.5.  With this object in view, the following suggestions are put forward.Form of the Treaty6. The preamble of General Assembly resolution 502 (VI) recognises that a genuine system for Disarmament must include all kinds of armed forces and armaments. It is therefore suggested that the international agreement on disarmament should be incorporated in a single Treaty.7. This Treaty would contain a preamble and be divided into two parts.The first part would contain certain general affirmations of obligation as described in paragraphs 9 and 10 below. The second part would make provision for putting into effect these obligations. A detailed description of the methods to be emplyed to carry out the second part of the Treaty would be incorporated in a series ofAnnexes to the Treaty.42621 b 2
The Preamble; 8. Tfte preamble would reflect both the preamble of General Assemblyresolution. 502 (VI) and the essential principles for a Disarmament Programmecontained in the United States proposals, circulated as DC/C. 1/1. It. would emphasise the overriding need to abolish war as an instrument of national policy.First Operative Part of the Treaty9. The first operative part of the Treaty would contain.ah undertaking bythe Contracting Parties, in fulfilment of their declared intention to abolish war as an instrument of national policy, to carry out the full aims of the DisarmamentTreaty, i.e., to achieve the regulation, limitation arid balanced reduction, inaccordance with the second part of the Treaty, of all sea, land, air and para-militaryarmed forces and armed police, arid of all types Of arrnaments and warlike equip-ment, including the elimination of all major weapons Of mass destruction and theprohibition of atomic weapons, and to ensure the use of atomic energy for peacefulpurposes only. It would also be. provided that, after the Treaty has come intoeffect, the Contracting Parties will, under such international control as may be.agreed, restrict their armed forces and armaments to the permitted levels and ceaseand prohibit the production of major weapons of mass destruction, includingatomic weapons, while confining their use of atomic energy&apos; to peaceful purposesonly.10. The first operative part of the Treaty could also contain a declaration that the Contracting Parties would not exploit for purposes of aggression the armed forces and armaments remaining at their disposal, while the Disarmament treaty was being brought into effect.The Second Part of the Treaty11. The second part of the Treaty would contain a series of articles, eachcovering one of the aspects of Disarmament listed in paragraph 1 above, with itsappropriate Annex giving the details for putting the undertakings contained in thearticle into effect.12. Since an organ must exist to ensure the full execution of the provisionsof the Treaty, it would be logical to put the establishment of the control organin the first article. The control organ would carry out operations of verificationon information disclosed by the Contracting Parties in respect of their armed forces and armaments and so supervise the processes of limitation, reduction or elimination -tion as to ensure that the undertakings given by the Contracting Parties were beingfulfilled. There would be an Annex defining the constitution and powers of thecontrol organ, another Annex listing the operations of verification which it wouldbe entitled to carry out, and a third defining the powers conceded to the organ toenable it effectively to supervise and control the processes of limitation, reductionor elimination.13. Since the General Assembly resolution states that the putting into effectof progressive and continuing disclosure and verification of all armed forces and armaments is recognised as a first and indispensable step in carrying out the Disarma-ment Programme, a further article, or articles, would contain an undertaking bythe Contracting Parties to disclose, in accordance with the time-table envisaged. inparagraph 1J below, information which should be specified in an Annex, and.to afford the control organ the necessary facilities for verification.14. Next there would be an article containing an undertaking by the Con-tracting Powers to reduce the effectives of all their armed forces, including sea, land and air and para-military forces and armed police, under the supervision of thecontrol organ and in accordance with the time-table already mentioned, to the levels to be set out in a further Annex. This article would also contain under-takings by the Contracting Parties thereafter not to increase these forces above suchagreed levels and to join with the other Contracting Parties in yet further reductions.15. There is a need for a more specific definition than exists in the general assembly resolution of the types of armaments and equipment which should bereduced, eliminated or prohibited. There would be an article accepting definitionsof these weapons as set out in an appropriate Annex.
16. This article should be followed, by an artide, similar to the articlecovering the limitation and reduction of armed forces, in respect of arms andequipment suitable for warlike purposes. It would contain an undertaking toreduce such arms and equipment to the levels specified in a corresponding Annex;and to eliminate such weapons-as had, under the previous article, been&apos;defined asbelonging to the Category requiring elimination.17. The time-table, in accordance wKh which the &quot;preceding articles would Ijebrought into effect, would be set but in an Annex to a further, article. The safe-guards against violation of the Treaty would.also be set out as an Annex to an &quot;article embodying agreement oh the body which should decide when&quot;violations have occurred. . -.18. Finally, there should be articles-specjfying the circumstances under whichthe Treaty should cdme into force, and conditions for subsequent accessions to theTreaty and amendment to the Treaty.
