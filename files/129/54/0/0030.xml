Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 6 6C. (52) 2809th August, 1952CABINETMONOPOLIES AND RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES bill memorandum by the President of the Board of trade my colleagues will remember that when Cabinet on 31st July discussed thelegislative programme for the 1952-53 Session (C.C. (52) 75th Conclusions,Minute 2), I said that I would welcome an early decision on the question whetheror not the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Bill should be included in this programme. In this memorandum I set out the considerations which seem to meto bear on the degree of importance to be attached to including such a Bill in theLegislative Programme for the coming Session. Broadly speaking there are twosets of considerations to be taken into account first, administrative considerations,and, secondly, political ones and I deal with each of these in turn.2. Administratively there are a number of reasons for expediting this Bill.The basic reason for having a Bill is that too slow an out-turn of reports by the monopolies Commission apart from arousing criticism of the monopolies policyof the Government of the day creates a real difficulty in covering a sufficientlywide field of industry upon which to form conclusions as to the principles whichshould guide us in these matters.3. Politically, the question is what weight the Government gives to the needfor some public manifestation of the importance they attach to an active policy onmonopolies and restrictive practices. Action to increase the effectiveness of the monopolies Commission (and to bring the statutory monopolies within their pur-view) was given some prominence in our Election programme and a Bill for thepurpose was announced in the King&apos;s Speech last November. Failure to includeit in the programme for the next Session will certainly lead to comment. On theother hand, there is no real pressure of public opinion to proceed urgently withthis matter and the recent debate in the House of Commons (23rd July) did notindicate despite the usual expressions of disappointment with the present rate of progress that Parliament itself was in a mood to make a first-class issue of theproblem at present.4. I should add that I am hoping to appoint a new Chairman if I can get himto accept the salary. There would I think be some advantage in letting him work  the machine for a year before we amend it, especially as we intend to make a general reference under Section 15 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (inquiry and Control) Act, 1948, which will widen the activities of the Commission.5. My conclusion is therefore that the inclusion of the Monopolies and restrictive Practices Bill in the Legislative programme for the coming Session wouldbe useful and would honour our pledges, but it would not be disastrous if wepostponed it for another year.P. T.Board of Trade, S.W.1,9th August, 1952.42750
