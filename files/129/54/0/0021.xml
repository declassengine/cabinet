oCONFIDENTIALC. (52) 271 COPY NO   ,- 029TH JULY,1952CABINETINTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON GENOCIDEMemorandum by the Foreign Secretary and theHome SecretaryThis memorandum raises the question whether we should accede to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime ofGenocide,    The text of the Convention is set out in the Annex.    its purpose is to prohibit and punish acts committed with intent to destroyin whole or in part a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.2,     The Convention  was unanimously adopted at the Third Session ofthe General assembly of tho United Nations in December,1948.    TheUnited Kingdom delegate, whilst voting in favour, made the reservationthat His Majesty&apos;s Government could not, without further examination,be taken as committed to changes in British domestic law, in particular the law relating to political asylum.3.      The Convention came into force in January,!95J and so far, 38 states have ratified or acceded to it.    The question of our accession was complicated by certain reservations made by the U,S.S.R, and other states,    This difficulty has, however, now been disposed of, since  theInternational Court of Justice has ruled that   reservations may be madeto the Convention provided they are compatible with its purpose.    the ruling of the Court leaves it to individual States to decide for themselveswhether or not a reservation is compatible.4,     The opinion of the International Court leaves it open to us, in theory,to accede with reservations,but it would be contrary to our general policy to do so.    We have considered whether we should ask the Cabinet to approve a departure from that general policy on this occasion byauthorising a reservation to the effect that, whilst this country accepts the principle of Article VII of the Convention that the political nature ofthe offence should not be an absolute bar to extradition for genocide,nevertheless a discretion should be retained to the Home Secretary or tothe Courts to refuse to surrender a fugitive; but we fear that other parties to the Convention might well maintain that such a reservation wasnot compatible with the objects of the Convention, which was intended tobrand genocide as a crime which nothing, and certainly not politicalmotives, can excuse, and we suggest that the   decision must be either to accede or not to accede.5,     The following considerations are relevant:-(a)   Genocide is ordinarily a crime committed by, or connivedat, by a Government; and a Government which isprepared to commit or connive at such a crime is not likely to be restrained by the provisions of theConvention.    The Convention indeed is not likelyto have much practical effect.
(b) It is possible however that the provisions of the Conventionmight be invoked.when a Government responsible foracts of genocide had fallen and had been succeeded by aGovernment of a different complexion.    At that stage the members of the original Government might have soughtasylum in a country sympathetic to their views, wherethey would have become political refugess;   and it is inthose circumstances that accession to the Conventionmight give rise to difficult questions.    Suppose, forexample    that a political leader in a country withwhich we had an extradition treaty were driven out of power and sought refuge in this country, it is notinconceivable that a request might be made by the new government for his surrender for an offence of genocide,and if adequate prima facie evidence were supplied ofsuch an offence, it might well be difficult to refuse to surrenderhim, whatever we thought about the motive behind therequest for his surrender.    It might well be, however,that public opinion would be much disturbed by the surrender of a fugitive in such circumstances.(c) The Convention commands considerable support at home andabroad and we should be giving useful propaganda to the communists if we failed to support a measure which hadon the face of it such laudable intentions . and had alreadybeen accepted, for all its limitations, by 38 States.    a failure to accede might be exploited by the ill-disposed, andmight confuse the ill-Informed, with regard to theGovernment&apos;s attitude to the crime of genocide.    Therehas already been some criticism, at home and abroad, ofthe delay in acceding to the Convention,6,    Our view is that, on balance, it would be right to accede to theConvention.    It would however, be necessary first to pass legislation and as implied in paragraph 5(b) that legislation would be controversial,since for this class of offence we should be surrendering the traditionalright of asylum for political refugees,7.    We suggest that it would be as well if, before a final decision iscome to, a Bill should be drafted so that the Cabinet can see exactly whatlegislation would be necessary to enable this country to accede to theConvention,    The Bill would have to provide (a) that all the acts ofgenocide set out in the Convention should be made criminal offences;(b) that all such offences should be made extradition crimes;  and (c) that where a request was made for the extradition of a person for an offenceof genocide, it should not be a bar to his surrender that the  offence was ofa political character, although it should clearly remain permissible torefuse surrender if it appeared that the motive of the request waspolitical and there was not a bona fide charge of genocide,8,    We accordingly ask for authority to have a Bill drafted, with a viewto our bringing the matter before the Cabinet again when the draft is ready, and we suggest that a decision on the question whether we shouldaccede to the Convention should be deferred until then,A.E.D.M.
