(52) 290 COPY NO.   C?2ND SEPTEMBER, 1952CABINETCONFERENCE ON GERMAN EXTERNAL DEBTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Chancellor of the exchequer we think we should bring before our colleagues the Report of theConference on German External Debts, which took place in London between28th February and 8th August.   A copy of this Report is attached.   TheConference was held under the auspices of the Tripartite Commission on german Debts, a body appointed last year by Her Majesty&apos;s Government and theFrench and United States Governments, to represent the three Governments inthe negotiation of a settlement of Germany&apos;s pre-war and post-war debts.Provisional terms of settlement for Germany&apos;s post-war debts arising outof the economic assistance given by the three Powers since the war had been worked out at the end of last year, and the Conference was in the main concerned only with Germany&apos;s pre-war debts.   No account could be taken of debts owedby debtors in Eastern Germany, except where they had  assets in western germany.2, The recommendations of the Conference are contained in SectionIV (pages 4 - 7) of the Report, which deals with certain general matters,and in a number of appendices, which contain the terms of settlementnegotiated between creditors and debtors together with other recommendationsdesigned to ensure the smooth working of the settlement plan.3. The Conference had to deal with many kinds of debt, some of greatcomplexity, and nearly all in default since before the war.   The following arethe main categories into which the debts were divided:-(l) Reich debts and other debts of public authorities;(2) Other medium- and long-term debts;(3) Standstill debts;(4) Commercial and miscellaneous debts.The recommended terms of settlement for the various classes of debt conform,broadly speaking, to the following general pattern: -(i) There has been no reduction of principal.(ii) Interest rates are reduced by about 25%.(iii) Arrears of interest are partly funded and serviced, and partly waived,or payment is postponed.
(iv) Payments on loans containing gold clauses to protect creditors againstcurrency depreciation will be made as though the value of the currency of issue of the loans had been defined in relation not to gold butto the United States dollar.   In the case of the 1930 Young Loan thereis a further exchange guarantee under which, if there is a variationby 5% or more in the exchange rates ruling between the currenciesof issue, a creditor may choose the least depreciated of thesecurrencies rather than the United States dollar as the basis onwhich to calculate the amount due to him.(v) There will be no repayment of principal on most types of debt duringthe first five years.(vi) Maturity dates of loans are extended, generally, by twenty years.(vii)  It is proposed that the settlement plan shall operate from 1st January, 1953.4. These terms were the result of hard and prolonged bargaining betweenprivate creditor representatives and the Germans, in which the government representatives played little part.   The creditor representatives were satisfied with the result and have agreed to recommend the terms for acceptance by the individual creditors in the different countries.   Thesettlement will entail ah estimated annual transfer by the Federal Republic onthe German pre-war debts of about DM 360 millions ( 30 millions) rising after five years to about DM 460 millions ( 39 millions).   This represents asubstantial improvement on the first German offer.   This was partly made possible by a concession from the United States Government on the settlementof the German post-war debt to the U.S.A. , which is referred to inparagraph 8 below.   The total German payments on external debts, including those on the post-war economic assistance debts, has been estimated by theGermans at about DM 600 millions a year, rising after five years to aboutDMi 740 millions ( 51 millions to  63 millions).   These sums are exclusive ofthe payments which will be made on the substantial claims by the IsraelGovernment and by the international Jewish bodies for reparation for thedestruction of Jewish lives and property (a settlement of these is expectedshortly);  they are also of course additional to the Reparations settlementunder the Paris Agreement of 1946 under which Germany has lost the bulk ofher assets abroad, including those in the United Kingdom.   The dividend whichwill be paid to United Kingdom creditors of Germany out of the funds derivedfrom the liquidation of the latter is being paid ex gratia by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and is additional to what the creditors are entitled to receive underthe pre-war debt settlement dealt with in this paper.5. The proportion of Germany&apos;s total pre-war debts owing to theUnited Kingdom is roughly 17%.   A parallel proportion of the estimated annuityto be paid by the Federal Republic would give a figure of  5jf millions,rising after five years to perhaps  6f millions as the maximum amount offoreign exchange accruing to the United Kingdom for the service of Germanpre-war debts.   In addition, the United Kingdom will receive an annuity of 7^- millions on her post-war claims (see paragraph 8 below).6. The German delegation argued strongly that, although the federal republic had every intention of fulfilling the obligations assumed under theplan, the settlement terms would put a heavy burden upon the German economy;accordingly, they pressed:-(i) for the inclusion in the Conference Report of a statement that fulfilment of the plan by the Federal Republic would depend upon creditorcountries co-operating to the full in the purchase of German exports and in the liberalisation of their trade with Germany;
(ii) for the inclusion in the Intergovernmental Agreement which will giveeffect to the settlement plan of a &quot;consultation clause&quot;, toprovide for the possibility of the Federal Republic havingdifficulty in meeting its obligations.The other delegations were unwilling to go as far as the German delegationwanted, and paragraph 21 (page 5) of the Report is the compromise eventuallyagreed upon.7. Apart from a small number of questions left for later settlement,the Conference agreed upon solutions to all the problems which were brought forward by the interested parties, private as well as governmental, andwhich were within its terms of reference.   The settlement terms which wereworked out have been recommended for approval by Governments andembodiment in an Intergovernmental Agreement which would give effect tothem.   The Conference concluded that they would provide equitable treatmentof all the interests affected, should enable normal debtor-creditor relation-ships to be restored, and by ending German default should contribute to the recovery of German credit standing.   The Conference has in fact been a success and is an important further step in the process of re-establishingnormal relationships between the Federal Republic and the Western world.We therefore recommend the Cabinet to approve the Report, so that the further steps necessary to give effect to the settlement plan can now be taken.8. Reference is made above to the provisional terms for the repayment of their post-war claims on Germany, which the three Powers informed theFederal Republic in December, 1951, that they were prepared to acceptprovided that a satisfactory pre-war settlement was achieved.   These termsprovided for the reduction of the total sums due, by 62 j% in the case of theUnited States claim of 03,200 millions, and by 25% in the case of the UnitedKingdom claim of  201 millions and of the French claim of the equivalent of 016 millions.   The reduced United States claim of 01,200 millions was to be repaid over 35 years at 2\% interest; and the reduced United Kingdom andFrench claims of  150 millions and 011. 8 millions respectively, to be repaidover 20 years without interest.   Just before the conclusion of the DebtConference the United States delegation announced that the United StatesGovernment, as an additional concession, would not demand any repayment of principal on their claim for the first five years of the settlement plan.The total principal due to the United States is therefore to be repaid over30 years, but interest payments will be made, as originally planned, over35 years.9. We consider that the satisfactory pre-war debt settlement plan worked out at the Conference justifies the confirmation by Her Majestyls Governmentof the provisional settlement terms for the post-war debts set out inparagraph 8 above.   Moreover, it was the agreement of the United StatesGovernment to the unequal scaling-down of the post-war claims on Germany,which under an agreement with the Federal Republic of 6th March, 1951, havea priority status, and the consequential reduction by 02,000 millions of these claims, which made possible a pre-war debt settlement at all.   The furtherstep of postponing repayment of principal on the United States claim for fiveyears and thus reducing the immediate hard currency claim on Germany,enabled the Federal Government to accept a heavier scale of repayment ofthe pre-war debts in this period than it would otherwise have been preparedto do.   It is important, therefore, that nothing should be done to upset theprovisional settlement of the post-war debts.   For this reason also we strongly recommend to our colleagues that it be confirmed.   The settlement would then
be effected by means of separate bilateral agreements between the UnitedKingdom, United States and France and the Federal Republic, to be concluded at the same time as the Intergovernmental Agreement on germany&apos;s pre-war debts.RECOMMENDATIONS10. We recommend:&quot;(1) that the Cabinet should approve the Report of the German DebtConference and authorise the conclusion of an IntergovernmentalAgreement to give effect to it;(2) that the Cabinet should agree that the provisional settlement terms for the United Kingdom post-war claim on Germany should be confirmed and a bilateral agreement with the Federal Republicconcluded to give effect to them.A.E.R.A.B.2ND SEPTEMBER, 1952

REPORT OF THE CONFERENCE ON GERMANEXTERNAL DEBTSLondon, February-August 1952I. introduction. The International Conference on German External Debts was calledby the Governments of the Republic of France, the United Kingdom ofGreat Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America inorder to work out a general agreement for the settlement of German externaldebts. The Conference presents to the Governments of the participating countries this Report describing its work and setting forth its recommenda-tions relating to the settlement of these debts. The Conference suggests thatcopies of the Report should be made available to other interested governments.2. Prior to calling the Conference, the Governments of France, theUnited Kingdom and the United States of America and the Government ofthe Federal Republic of Germany concluded, on 6th March, 1951, an agree-ment in which the latter confirmed its liability for the pre-war external debtsof the German Reich, acknowledged in principle its debts for post-war economic assistance furnished to Germany by the three Governments, and declared its willingness to resume payments on the German external debtsin accordance with a plan to be worked out by all interested parties. A copyof the exchange of letters embodying this Agreement is contained inAppendix 1.3. In May 1951 the three Governments set up the Tripartite Corn-mission on German Debts to represent them in the negotiations relating tothe settlement of German external debts and to organise the work of theConference. The three Governments were represented on the TripartiteCommission by M. Francois-Didier Gregh (France), Sir George Rendel(United Kingdom), and Ambassador Warren Lee Pierson (United States);their alternates were M. Rene Sergent (France), who was later replaced byM. A. Rodocanachi and M. H. Davost, Sir David Waley (United Kingdom)and Minister J. W. Gunter (United States).4. The Commission held preliminary discussions in June and July 1951with the German Delegation on External Debts, appointed by the Govern-ment of the Federal Republic of Germany, and with representatives from some of the principal creditor countries. The German Delegation was headed by Herr Hermann J. Abs, with alternate Dr. W. Kriege.5. In December 1951 the Tripartite Commission informed the german delegation of the amounts and terms of payment which the three Govern-ments were prepared to accept in full settlement of their claims in respectof post-war economic assistance, on condition that a satisfactory and equitable settlement of Germany&apos;s pre-war debts were achieved. Duringthe Conference the United States of America further offered to defer collectionof the principal of its claim for a period of five years and amended its offer of December 1951 accordingly. The amounts and terms are outlined inAppendix 2 of this report.II.-Organisation of the Conference6. The Conference held its first plenary meeting at Lancaster House,London, on 28th February, 1952. The Governments of France, the UnitedKingdom and the United States of America were represented by the TripartiteCommission on German Debts; the private creditors of these three countries were represented by separate delegations; 22 creditor countries sent nationaldelegations composed of governmental and, in many cases, private creditorrepresentatives; 3 countries sent observers; the Bank for International Settle-ments was represented as a creditor in its own right; the Delegation ofthe Federal Republic of Germany included governmental representatives and representatives of private debtors. A list of the delegates is attached asa Final Appendix.7. In accordance with the decisions of the Conference, there were setup :-(a) The Steering Committee, composed of the three members of the tripartite Commission, 13 representatives of creditor interests from belgium, Brazil, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland,the United Kingdom and the United States, and 5 members represent-ing public and private debtor interests. Its duty was to organise thework of the Conference and to ensure that all recommendations -sub-mitted to plenary meetings were such as to achieve an equitable overallsettlement and equal treatment for all creditors within each category.17743-1   42528-1 B 2
(b) The Creditors&apos; Committee, in which each of the delegations of creditorcountries was represented. Its duty was to co-ordinate the views ofthe various groups of creditor interests, to appoint creditor representa-tives to negotiating committees and to convey to the steering committee the creditors&apos; views with respect to any recommendationsresulting from negotiating committees.(c) The Conference Secretariat under a Secretary-General. The Secretary-General was first Mr. H. A. Cridland and later Mr. E. H. Peck.8. The Steering Committee established four negotiating Committees todeal, respectively, with the following categories of debts : Committee A. Reich debts and other debts of public authorities;Committee B. Other medium- and long-term debts;Committee C. Standstill debts; and committee D. Commercial and miscellaneous debts.Each Committee was composed of representatives of the creditors and debtors,together with observers from the Tripartite Commission. A number of sub-committees was set up by the Negotiating Committees to deal withspecific types of debts.9. The Steering Committee also established a Statistical Committee toassist the Conference.10. The Conference was in session between 28th February and8th August, 1952, with a recess from 5th April to 19th May, to enablenecessary consultations to take place.III. Framework11. In carrying out its work the Conference has been guided by thefollowing facts, principles and objectives:  (a) The Governments of France, the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates of America have given the Government of the Federal republic of Germany assurances with regard to the scaling down and the termsof settlement of the post-war claims for economic aid extended toGermany, which would be accepted by the three Governments on con-dition that a satisfactory and equitable settlement of pre-war debtswere achieved (see Appendix 2);ib) The Settlement Plan should-(i) take into account the general economic position of the federal republic and the effects of the limitations on its territorial juris-diction; it should neither dislocate the German economy throughundesirable effects on the internal financial situation, nor undulydrain existing or potential German foreign exchange resources, andit should not add appreciably to the financial burden of any ofthe three Governments;(ii) provide for an orderly overall settlement and assure fair and equitable treatment of all the interests affected;(iii) provide for appropriate action on the reunification of Germany.(c) The Settlement Plan should promote the re-establishment of normalfinancial and commercial relations between the Federal Republic ofGermany and other countries.  To this end it should-(i) eliminate the state of default of Germany by suitable treatment ofmatured and maturing debts and of arrears of interest;(ii) lead to a situation which would permit a return to normal debtor-creditor relationships;(iii) be of such a character as to contribute to the recovery ofGermany&apos;s international credit by the restoration of confidence in her financial standing and reliability as a borrower, while giving a reasonable assurance that Germany will not again default on herundertakings;(iv) be compatible with and as far as possible facilitate the FederalRepublics eventual compliance with obligations which membersof the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation have assumed with regard tothe transfer of payments for current transactions, including interestand earnings on investments.IV. Recommendations12. Reich Debts and other Debts of Public Authorities. The recom-mendations for the settlement of debts in this category are contained inAppendix 3.
13. Other Medium- and Long-Tenn Debts. The recommendations forthe settlement of debts in this category are contained in Appendix 4.14. Standstill Debts. The recommendations for the settlement of debtsin this category are contained in Appendix 5. The Conference is in agree-ment that these recommendations should be put into effect at the earliest date possible.15. Commercial and Miscellaneous Debts--The recommendations forthe settlement of debts in this category are contained in Appendix 6.16. The Conference considered several debt problems the special natureof which made their complete and definitive settlement during the Conferenceimpossible. Plans were laid for their subsequent solution in negotiations between the interests involved. Appropriate provisions in this regard havebeen included in the respective appendices of this Report. Such negotiations should be guided by the principles and objectives of the Conference and the resulting recommendations, if approved, should be covered by the Inter-governmental Agreement.17. The terms proposed for the settlement of German debts coveredby the Settlement Plan have been worked out in intensive negotiations between representatives of the creditors and the debtors. They conform as closely as possible to the existing contracts.18. As will be seen from Appendices 3-6, no repayment in foreign exchange of the principal of any debt covered by the recommendations shouldbe made during an initial period of five years, except in special cases wherethe recommended settlement terms contain provisions which justify somerepayment of principal in the initial period.19. Appropriate provision is made in the Appendices for cases of hardship.If a debtor who has several external loans outstanding is unable to meethis obligations under the Settlement Plan, any negotiations between debtorand creditors should be so conducted as to give equal protection to theinterests of the respective creditors.20. The settlement of debts owed by the City of Berlin or by publicutility enterprises owned or controlled by the City of Berlin and locatedtherein is deferred for the time being. Private debtors residing in the western sectors of Berlin, however, should be treated like residents of the federal republic.21. The Intergovernmental Agreement mentioned in paragraph 38 should provide that the Federal Government will resume the transfer of interest andamortisation instalments in accordance with the Settlement Plan, and will do everything in its power to ensure such transfer.The Conference recognised the principle that the transfer of payments under the Settlement Plan implies the development and maintenance of a balance of payments situation in which those payments, like other payments for current transactions, can be financed by foreign exchange receipts fromvisible and invisible transactions so that more than a temporary drawing onmonetary reserves is avoided. In this connection due consideration should begiven to the fact that the convertibility of currencies has not yet been re-estab-lished. The Conference therefore recognised that the development andmaintenance of this balance of payments situation would be facilitated by thecontinuance of international co-operation to promote liberal trade policies,the expansion of world trade and the revival of the free convertibility ofcurrencies. It recommends that due account should be taken by all concerned of the principles referred to in this paragraph.In preparing the Intergovernmental Agreement consideration should begiven to working out provisions designed to ensure that the Settlement plan is operated and fulfilled to the satisfaction of all parties concerned includingprovisions to apply in case the Federal Republic, in spite of its utmostefforts, is faced with difficulties in carrying out its obligations under the Plan.22. Transfers of interest and amortisation payments due under theSettlement Plan should be treated as payments for current transactions and,where appropriate, included in any arrangements relating to trade and/orpayments between the Federal Republic and any of the creditor countries,regardless of whether such agreements are of a bilateral or multilateralnature.23. No discrimination or preferential treatment in the fulfilment of theterms agreed on as among categories of debts or currencies in which payable,or in any other respects, should be permitted by the Federal Republic orsought by the creditor countries.
24. The Government of the Federal Republic should enact the legislativemeasures and take the administrative action necessary to implement the Plan,such as measures to give the foreign creditor the right to enforce his claim in German courts.25. The basis of the settlements foreseen in this report is an offer made or to be made by the debtor to the creditor. Such offer, even if recommendedby the creditor representatives, or resulting from arbitration, unless it isspecifically agreed that arbitration is binding on individual creditors, maybe refused by the creditor, in which case the benefit of the Settlement Plancannot be claimed by him. The Government of the Federal Republic shall beentitled to take account of this position in giving effect to the provisions ofparagraph 24.26. The Intergovernmental Agreement should state that, in the case ofan accepted offer whenever, under the Settlement Plan, the original debtrelationship between the creditor and the debtor is modified, or a new contractconcluded between the creditor and the debtor, the latter shall, upon thecomplete fulfilment of the obligations thereby constituted, be deemed to havedischarged fully and finally both his obligations under the modified or newdebt relationship and those under the original one.27. Prescription on claims covered by the present Settlement Plan shouldnot run during the period in which the sums due under the original contractceased to be available to the creditors until the date when the sums due areavailable under the present Settlement Plan.In addition prescriptions should not be invoked against the rights offoreign holders of internal German securities (including promissory notesand bills of exchange) until at least one year after transfer in foreign exchangeof interest or dividends on these securities is available.The Federal Government should take any necessary measures to securethe observance of this principle.28. Some loan contracts contain a currency option, i.e., at the option ofthe creditor, payment may be required in some currency other than the currency of the country in which the loan was issued. Some other contractsmay contain similar provisions. This matter is to be discussed further bythe Governments concerned with a view to reaching full agreement beforethe conclusion of the Intergovernmental Agreement.Without prejudice to any agreement which may thus be reached as tothe currency in which payment is to be made, currency options should, inthose cases where the contract provides for payment of a fixed amount ofthe alternative currency, be considered valid as exchange guarantees; e.g., anycreditor holding a loan contract containing such a currency option shall beentitled to receive in the currency of the country in which the loan was issuedthe equivalent, at the rate of exchange current on the date payment fallsdue, of the amount of the alternative currency which would have been pay-able if the option had been exercised.29. For the purpose of the settlements foreseen in the Agreed Recom-mendations, except as otherwise provided, e.g., in the case of the YoungLoan, the following shall apply:  In the case of debts expressed in gold dollars or gold Swiss francs,the debts shall be computed on the basis of 1 currency dollar equalling1 gold dollar and 1 currency Swiss franc equalling 1 gold Swiss franc,and the new contracts shall be expressed in currency dollars or currencySwiss francs respectively.In the case of other debts with gold clauses (excluding German cur-rency debts with gold clauses see Appendices 4 and 6) the amountsdue shall be payable only in the currency of the country in which the loanwas raised or the issue was made (below referred to as &quot; the currency of issue &quot;), the amount due being computed as the equivalent at the rateof exchange when the amount is due for payment of a sum in UnitedStates dollars which shall be arrived at by converting the amount of theobligation expressed in the currency of issue into United States dollarsat the rate of exchange ruling when the loan was raised or the issue made.The amount of currency of issue so reached shall, however, not be lessthan if it were computed at the rate of exchange current on 1st August,1952.30. On the question of the gold clause in general the Tripartite Corn-mission informed the Conference that, as part of the arrangements agreed on in order to make a comprehensive settlement of the German debt problempossible, the Governments of France, the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates of America had decided that, in so far as the German Debt settlement was concerned, gold clauses should not be maintained but might be replaced by some form of exchange guarantee.
With respect to the Young Loan, they of course regarded it as essentialthat the equality of treatment for the different issues of that Loan providedfor under the loan contract should be maintained. The representatives ofthe European bondholders have expressed their regret at the decision to depart from the contractual right of the bondholders of this internationalLoan to payment in their own currencies on a gold basis. They haveinserted in the &quot; Agreed Recommendations for the Settlement of Reich debtsand debts of other public authorities&quot; (Appendix 3) the provision thereincluded solely in view of this Governmental decision.Corresponding provisions had been included in other reports where appropriate.31. Appendix 7 contains agreed recommendations for. the treatment ofpayments made to the Konversionskasse problem.32. Deutsche Mark balances which accrue to a foreign creditor as theresult of the settlement of a German debt falling under the Plan should beavailable for use substantially in accordance with the provisions at present inforce in the Federal Republic of Germany, including the transfer of the balances to other non-residents of Germany. Agreed recommendations forthe utilisation of Deutsche Mark accounts are set out in Appendix 8.33. Consideration has been given to the question whether it is necessaryto recommend the enactment of legislation in the creditor countries to limit the activities of creditors in seeking settlement of their claims against Germany.The conclusion has been reached that such legislation is not essential to thesuccessful functioning of the Settlement Plan.34. The Conference considers that the recommendations made in thisReport conform to the principles set forth in paragraph 11.35. The representatives of private creditors who have participated in theConference will recommend to the individual creditors that the terms of theSettlement Plan should be accepted, so far as they are concerned.36. The Government of the Federal Republic should undertake to accelerate the technical preparations necessary to ensure the effective carryingout of the present proposals by the dates indicated in the respectiveAppendices.37. The Conference expresses the hope that the Trustees concerned inthe administration of loans will feel able to make their services available for theexecution of the terms of the Settlement Plan.38. In the interest of the re-establishment of Germany&apos;s credit abroad andin the interest of the creditors whose claims have gone unsettled for manyyears, the recommendations contained in this Report should be dealt with bythe interested Governments without delay, with a view to entering into anIntergovernmental Agreement to give international authority to the SettlementPlan simultaneously with a settlement of the Federal Republic^ debts inrespect of post-war economic assistance.Adopted at the Plenary Meeting of the Conference held on 8th August,1952.
APPENDIX 1Exchange of letters embodying the Agreement of 6th March, 1951, betweenthe Governments of France, the United Kingdom and the United Statesof America and the Government of the Federal Republic of germany. Letter to the Allied High Commission from the German FederalChancellorMr. High Commissioner, Bonn, 6th March, 1951.In reply to your letter of 23rd October, 1950 AGSEC (50) 2339(x) Ihave the honour to inform you as follows;  IThe Federal Republic hereby confirms that it is liable for the pre-war external debt of the German Reich, including those debts of other corporatebodies subsequently to be declared liabilities of the Reich, as well as for interest and other charges on securities of the Government of Austria to theextent that such interest and charges became due after 12th March, 1938,and before 8th May, 1945.The Federal Government understands that in the determination of themanner in which and the extent to which the Federal Republic will fulfilthis liability account will be taken of the general situation of the federal republic, including, in particular, the effects of the limitations on its territorialjurisdiction and its capacity to pay.IIThe Federal Government acknowledges hereby in principle the debt arisingfrom the economic assistance furnished to Germany since 8th May, 1945,to the extent to which liability for such debt has not previously beenacknowledged in the Agreement on Economic Co-operation concluded on15th December, 1949, between the Federal Republic and the United Statesof America, or for which the Federal Republic has not already taken over responsibility under Article .133 of the Basic Law. The Federal Governmentis ready to accord the obligations arising from the economic assistance priority over all other foreign claims against Germany or German nationals. TheFederal Government regards it as appropriate to regulate any questions con-nected with the recognition and settlement of these debts by bilateral agreements with the Governments of the countries which have renderedeconomic assistance patterned on the Agreement concluded with the UnitedStates of America on 15th December, 1949. The Federal Government takesfor granted that these agreements will contain an arbitration clause for casesof dispute. The Federal Government is prepared at once to enter into negotiations for the conclusion of such agreements with the Governmentsconcerned.bill the Federal Government hereby expresses its desire to resume payments on the German external debt. It understands that there is agreement betweenit and the Governments of France, the United Kingdom of Great Britainand Northern Ireland and of the United States of America on the following:  It is in the interest of the re-establishment of normal economic relationsbetween the Federal Republic and other countries to work out as soon aspossible a settlement plan which will govern the settlement of public and private claims against Germany and German nationals.Interested Governments, including the Federal Republic, creditors anddebtors, shall participate in working out this plan.The settlement plan shall in particular deal with those claims, the settle-ment o&apos;i which would achieve the objective of normalising the economicand financial relations of the Federal Republic with other countries. It willtake into account the general economic position of the Federal Republic,notably the increase of its burdens and the reduction in its economic wealth.The general effect of this plan shall neither dislocate the German economythrough undesirable effects on the internal financial situation nor undulydrain existing or potential German foreign-exchange resources. It shall also not add appreciably to the financial burden of any occupation Power.The Governments concerned may obtain expert opinions on all questions arising out of the negotiations on the settlement plan and on the capacity to pay.(&apos;) The text of this letter is given in Appendix 1 of the Memorandum prepared by the tripartite Commission on German Debts in December 1951 (pages 12-14 of the Englishtext).
The result of the negotiations shall be set forth in agreements.

Reply to the German Federal Chancellor from the Allied high commissioners on behalf of the Governments of France, the UnitedKingdom and the United States of AmericaMr. Chancellor, 6th March, 1951.In reply to your letter of 6th March, 195.1, on the subject of Germanindebtedness we have the honour, on behalf of the Governments of France,the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the UnitedStates of America, to acknowledge the undertakings of the Federal Govern-ment in regard to the responsibility of the Federal Republic for the pre-war external debts of the German Reich and for the debt arising out of theeconomic assistance furnished to Germany by the three Governments since8th May, 1945.With regard to the priority accorded to the obligations arising from thepost-war economic assistance, we are authorised to state that the three governments would not propose to exercise this priority in such a way as to restrict settlement of foreign-held claims arising out of trade subsequent to 8th May, 1945, essential to the economic recovery of the Federal Republic.With regard to the question of an arbitration clause in agreements covering the debts for post-war economic assistance, the three Governments will beprepared, when negotiating such agreements, to consider whether it would be useful to include an arbitration clause to deal with any matters which mightbe appropriately settled by such a procedure.We further have the honour on behalf of the three Governments to confirm the understandings of the Federal Government as set forth in thesecond paragraph of Article I and in Article III of your Excellency&apos;s letter.They are now engaged in preparing proposals for the working out of settle-ment arrangements: these will provide for the participation of foreigncreditors, German debtors, and interested Governments, including the federal government. The proposals will be designed to arrive at an orderly overallsettlement of pre-war claims against Germany and German debtors and ofthe debt arising out of the post-war economic assistance, which would be fair and equitable to all the interests affected, including those of the federal government. It is the intention that the resulting settlement should be embodied in a multilateral agreement; any bilateral agreements that may beconsidered to be necessary would be concluded within the framework of thesettlement plan. As soon as their proposals are ready the three governments will communicate them to the Federal Government and to other interested governments and will discuss with them these proposals and the procedure to be adopted for dealing with the subject.We have the honour to state that our three Governments regard yourExcellency&apos;s letter under reference and this letter as placing on record anagreement between the Governments of France, the United Kingdom ofGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America,on the one hand, and the Government of the Federal Republic on the other,concerning the questions of German indebtedness covered in these letters.These letters are prepared in English, French and German, each text being equally authentic.Accept, Mr. Chancellor, the renewed assurances of our highest esteem.A.

The present Agreement applies to every bonded loan and to everynon-bonded loan issued or raised outside Germany, if (a) the loan was made prior to 8th May, 1945; and(b) under the original contract the loan was to run for a period of fiveyears or more; and(c) me debtor is a corporation, company, association, firm, partnership,bank, church, welfare institution, or other non-governmental institu-tion; and(d) the debtor is, on 1st January, 1953, or on any later date when hiscreditors request an offer of settlement, resident in the german federal Republic or in any of the Western Sectors of Berlin; and(e) the loan is denominated in non-German currency, or is denominatedin German currency and contains a non-German currency or goldclause.2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, thepresent Agreement shall not be applicable to (i) the following categories of debts, which require separate treatment:  (a) debts of public utilities located in and controlled by the city of Berlin;(b) debts owed by a debtor to any person or persons who, directly or indirectly, own such debtor;(c) debts in respect of loans the original amount of which, con-verted at the exchange rate prevailing on 1st July, 1952, was less than U.S. $40,000;(d) debts subject to the Swiss-German Agreements of 6th Decem-ber, 1920, and 25th March, 1923 (the so-called SchweizerFrankengrundschulden);(ii) the debts of the jointly owned German-Swiss Boundary power plantson the Rhine. There are outstanding 3 bonded loans and 2 non-bonded loans which are owed by German companies to Swissbondholders and other creditors. Owing to certain special featuresrelating to the operation of jointly-owned power plants along the rhine, the settlement of these debts is bound up with other issues.Considering these circumstances, the final settlement (upon wliich itis impossible to agree at this time) is left for direct negotiations between Switzerland and the Federal Republic of Germany. How-ever the creditors agree that, in negotiating such a settlement, theywill not ask for payment of an annual amount exceeding 5 millionSwiss francs in the first five years after 1st January, 1953.3. No debt shall be excluded solely because a new debtor becomes or has become liable for it, by operation of iaw or otherwise, either before or after 8th May, 1945. For example, no debt of an enterprise subject to allied High Commission Law No. 27, &quot; Reorganisation of the German coal and Iron and Steel Industries,&quot; shall be excluded by virtue of the assumption of such debt by unit or other successor companies.4. This Agreement shall not apply to individual bonds or coupons which require validation under the German Validation Laws of 19th August, 1949,and the German Validation Law for Foreign Bonds of August 1952 until such bonds or coupons shall have been validated pursuant to the provisionsof any such law and of any intergovernmental agreement which may be entered into with the country of issue respecting such law.5. The problem of the debts of the German Central Bank for Agri-culture (Deutsche Rentenbank Kreditanstalt) is complicated by various factors.As a result of the partition of Germany the assets invested in East germany are presently uncollectable by the Bank, and to that extent the amount of debt covered by this Agreement is reduced by varying amounts as fixed42528-1 &quot; d 2
by existing regulations, the percentage being different in each case andranging from 20 per cent, to 67 per cent, of the outstanding loans. TheGerman representatives stated that the Federal Government do not atpresent have the power to alter this situation, which results in particularfrom the relevant regulations under the currency conversion legislation. Theydo agree that the Federal Government shall do everything in its powerto facilitate the settlement of the debts of the Bank and the payment ofinterest and amortisation as provided under the said Laws and Regulations.The creditors&apos; representatives reserve the right of the creditors to take such action as may be open to them to rectify what they consider to be asettlement prejudicial to and discriminatory as between different classes ofcreditors.It is understood that the Bank retains its liability to the creditors in respectof the indebtedness secured by assets in East Germany and will service thatliability as and when those assets become available to it.There are several other institutions in a similar position where the same principles should be applied.6. In dealing with the Potash Loan in any plan of settlement under theprovisions of this Agreement, there will need to be considered the specialfeatures of this loan.Article IVOutstanding Amount of Debt1. The outstanding amount of any debt is the unpaid principal and allunpaid interest due up to 1st January, 1953, such interest to be computed assimple interest at the rate established in the existing contract, regardless of whether the debt has matured before that date and regardless of the effect ofany default under the existing contract prior to that date.2. An amount is unpaid within the meaning of paragraph 1 of thisArticle if it has not been received and accepted expressly or implicitly bythe creditor. Acceptance by the creditor of funding bonds, scrip or cashfrom the Konversionskasse constitutes payment of any debt, or of any partof a debt, in respect of which they were accepted.Article VSettlement TermsI. PrincipalThere shall be no reduction in the outstanding principal amount.2. Foreign Currency Debts with Gold Clauses(a) Gold dollars and gold Swiss francs.In the case of debts expressed in gold dollars or gold Swiss francs,the debts shall be computed on the basis of 1 currency dollarequalling 1 gold dollar and 1 currency Swiss franc equalling 1 goldSwiss franc, and the new contracts shall be expressed in currencydollars or currency Swiss francs respectively.(b) Other currencies with gold clauses.In the case of other debts with gold clauses (excluding german currency debts with gold clauses see paragraph 3 below) the amountsdue shall be payable only in the currency, of the country in whichthe loan was raised or the issue was made (below referred to as&quot; the currency of issue&quot;), the amount due being computed as the equivalent at the rate of exchange when the amount is due for payment of a sum in U.S. dollars which shall be arrived at byconverting the amount of the obligation expressed in the currency of issue into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange ruling whenthe loan was raised or the issue made. The amount of currency of issue so reached shall, however, not be less than if it were computedat the rate of exchange current on 1st August, 1952.3. German Currency Debts with Gold Clauses(a) The principle is accepted that such financial debts and mortgages,expressed in Gold Marks or in Reichsmarks with a gold clause, as had a specific foreign character shall be converted into Deutsche Mark at therate of 1 Goldmark, or 1 Reichsmark with a gold clause, = 1 Deutsche Mark.(b) The definition of the criteria constituting the specific foreign characterof the above indebtedness shall be the subject of further negotiation. Bothsides reserve their position as to the question in which cases and in whichway the above principle can be implemented. It shall Me with the german delegation to decide how the solution arrived at can be fitted into the
framework of the German laws on currency reform and on the equalisationof war and post-war burdens.(c) The above-mentioned negotiation between a German delegation andcreditor delegates shall take place not later than 31st October, 1952.4. Arrears of InterestSubject to the provisions of paragraph 6 below, two-thirds of the unpaidinterest to 1st January, 1953, shall be funded and one-third waived. Suchfunded interest together with the unpaid principal shall constitute the newprincipal amount.5. Future Rate of InterestSubject to the provisions of paragraph 6 below, interest shall run from 1st January, 1953, irrespective of the date when the new contract is enteredinto pursuant to this Agreement, at 75 per cent, of the rate of interest providedfor in the existing contract. Such new current rate of interest, however, shallnot exceed 5J per cent, on bonded debts and 6 per cent, on non-bondedindebtedness, nor shall it be below 4 per cent., except that in cases where theinterest rate provided for in the existing contract is below 4 per cent the rateprovided for in the existing contract shall be paid.6. Interest Rate in Cases where there has been an Effective ConversionIn the case of any debt which has been the subject of an effective conver-sion the debtor shall elect either (a) to fund all unpaid interest outstanding under the existing contract to 1st January, 1953, and to pay interest from that date at the full rateprovided in the existing contract, or(b) to fund unpaid interest and to pay future interest as though the originalcontract were still in force and paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article wereapplicable.7. Payment of InterestInterest for the period beginning 1st January, 1953, shall be payable atleast semi-annually. Appropriate adjustment shall be made in any case wherethe new contract is not entered into until after 1st January, 1954, if the debtorcannot reasonably be expected to pay at once all interest due in respect of theperiod between 1st January, 1953, and the date the new contract is enteredinto.8. Amortisation Payments(a) Amortisation shall be paid annually from 1958 to 1962 at an annual rate of 1 per cent, of the new principal amount and thereafter until thematurity date at an equal rate of 2 per cent, of such new principal amount.Amortisation payments for each year after 1958 shall be increased by theamount of one year&apos;s interest on all debt retired by means of the amortisationpayments for previous years excluding, however, debt retired by means ofpayments made pursuant to sub-paragraph (d) below.(b) Amortisation payments shall be made on the first interest paymentdate in any given year. If the first interest payment date in 1958 does not fallon 1st January, the first amortisation payment shall be calculated for theperiod from 1st January, 1957, to such interest payment date, and the same principle shall apply when the annual rate of 2 per cent, comes into operation.(c) All such amortisation shall be applied to the reduction of the newprincipal amount. In the case of bond issues the amortisation payments shallbe applied to the retirement of bonds through call by lot at the par or face value unless otherwise agreed between the debtor and his creditors.(d) As long as the service is maintained in accordance with the newcontract, additional amortisation may be made by the debtor in any manner,including acquisition of bonds whether in the open market or otherwise.9. MaturityThe new contract shall establish a maturity date not less than 10 years normore than 25 years from 1st January, 1953. The new maturity date must beagreed upon between the debtor and his creditors. The debtor should offer the earliest maturity date, within the above limits, which is practicable inview of his particular circumstances.It is contemplated that maturities of 10 to 15 years, or in exceptional cases up to 20 years, should be accorded to industrial debtors, banks andchurches; public utilities and basic industries, however,, may extend theirmaturities to 20 years, but not in excess of 25 years in any case; and in thecase of non-bonded debt the normal maturity shall be 10 years.
10. Repayment of Small Amounts of IndebtednessWherever the outstanding amount of a debt is very small or is smallcompared to the amount of the original loan, agreements may be entered intofor an earlier repayment and final disposition of the entire amount of suchindebtedness and arrears of interest without regard to the provisions of paragraphs 8 and 9 of this Article.1.1. Hardship CasesWherever owing to extraordinary circumstances, including but not limitedto a loss of assets in Germany outside the Federal Republic of Germany andthe Western Sectors of Berlin, affecting the financial position of a debtor, it becomes impossible or impracticable for him to make an offer for a newcontract on the terms specified in this Agreement, agreements between the debtor and his creditors making such adjustments as may be deemed necessaryin the light of the particular circumstances shall not be precluded.12. SecuritySubject to other applicable provisions of law, the provisions of the existingcontract for liens and collateral and any other type of security for the protec-tion of creditors shall remain in force, but in so far as the security provided under the existing contract no longer corresponds in its nature or extent withthe new principal amount of the debt or no longer corresponds with thecircumstances prevailing at the time the new contract is entered into, the debtor may propose a change in the nature or extent of the security. Thesecurity proposed by the debtor shall, however, be fully adequate and mustbe acceptable to the creditor.To the extent that the security has been impaired or substantially altered the debtor shall make such readjustments as are necessary to provide hiscreditors with at least the degree of protection originally afforded.The creditor may demand, and his debtor shall provide, reasonable security or other protective provisions acceptable to the creditor.13. Reserves and Sinking FundsBecause the amortisation payments are only to commence in 1958 and thenat the relatively low rate of 1 per cent., and in 1963 increase to only 2 percent., the debtor shall pursue a policy of assuring a sufficiently strong liquidfinancial position in order to meet his obligations at maturity. Therefore,additional provisions should be discussed between creditors and debtorswhich may provide for the establishment of reserves or sinking funds for the debts under which an annual amount, calculated either as a percentage of thenet earnings prior to dividend payments or otherwise as may be agreed, shallbe set aside.14. Provision of Foreign ExchangeThe debtor shall make the arrangements required under German lawfor the provision of the necessary foreign exchange to discharge all obligations under the new contract.15. Default of the DebtorIn the event of default, in addition to any penalties for default provided in the new contract, the creditor shall be entitled, for the period of the default,to receive interest at the rate provided in the existing contract.16. Modification of TermsNothing in this Agreement shall prevent any debtor from obtaining, withthe consent of his creditors, terms more favourable to the debtor than thosespecified in this Agreement.17.

Section B. General PrinciplesArticle 6Conversion into Deutsche Mark(1) Claims expressed in Reichsmark shall be settled after the foreigncreditor has declared his agreement to his claim being converted into DeutscheMark at the same rate as would apply in the case of a similar claim ofa domestic creditor. This applies also to such monetary claims expressedin Goldmark or Reichsmark with a gold clause as had no specific foreigncharacter within the meaning of the following paragraph (2). The german foreign Exchange Control Authorities shall continue to issue any licencenecessary for a conversion pursuant to the Conversion Law or for a revisionof the conversion rate pursuant to the legislation on Deutsche Mark balancesheets, to the extent that the creditor is entitled to such conversion or revision.(2) The principle is accepted that such monetary claims arising from financial transactions and mortgages, expressed in Goldmark or in Reichsmarkwith a gold clause as had a specific foreign character, shall be converted intoDeutsche Mark at the rate of 1 Goldmark, or 1 Reichsmark with a goldclause, = 1 Deutsche Mark.The definition of the criteria constituting the specific foreign characterof such claims shall be the subject of further negotiation. The contractingparties reserve their position as to the question in which cases and in whichway the above principle can be implemented. It shall lie with the german delegation to decide how the solution arrived at can be fitted into the framework of the German laws on currency reform and on the equalisationof war and post-war burdens.The above-mentioned negotiations between a German Delegation and the creditors&apos; representatives should take place not later than 31st October, 1952.Article 7Claims expressed in Foreign Currency with Gold ClausesFor the purpose of the settlement of these claims the following principlesshall apply mutatis mutandis : In the case of debts expressed in gold dollars or gold Swiss francs,the debts shall be computed on the basis of 1 currency dollar equalling1 gold dollar and 1 currency Swiss franc equalling 1 gold Swiss franc,and the new contracts shall be expressed in currency dollars or currencySwiss francs respectively.In the case of other debts with gold clauses (excluding german currency debts with gold clauses see Article 6, paragraph 2) the amountsdue shall be payable only in the currency of the country in which the loanwas raised or the issue was made referred to below as &quot; the currency of issue.&quot; The amount due being computed as the equivalent at the rateof exchange when the amount is due for payment of a sum in U.S.dollars which shall be arrived at by converting the amount of theobligation expressed in the currency of issue into U.S. dollars at therate of exchange ruling when the loan was raised or the issue made.The amount of currency of issue so reached shall, however, not be lessthan if it were computed at the rate of exchange current on1st August, 1952.Article 8Computation in Deutsche Mark of Claims expressed in Foreign CurrencyClaims expressed in foreign currency shall be computed in Deutsche Markbased on the parity of the day preceding the date of repayment, as notified to the International Monetary Fund. When the parity is not laid down,the computation shall be made according to the mean rate of exchange quoted by the Bank deutscher Lander on the day preceding the date of payment forthe currency concerned.Article 9Konversionskasse for German External DebtsI. The German Delegation was of the opinion that the German debtorwas definitively discharged of his debt to the extent of his payments intothe Konversionskasse. The creditor representatives, on the other hand,were of the opinion that as a rule such payments into the Konversionskassewould not be recognised as discharging the German debtors under the laws of their respective countries.  In their desire to put an end to fruitless legal
discussions, both sides agreed to seek a practical solution which would permitsettlement of the claims of the creditors without unnecessary formalities.Accordingly the German Delegation and the foreign creditor representa-tives, while reserving their respective legal positions, have agreed asfollows : (1) The German debtor undertakes to settle the creditors claim inaccordance with the new settlement terms, regardless of the payments made to the Konversionskasse, to the extent that the creditor (a) has not in fact received from the Konversionskasse the paymentcorresponding to that made by the debtor to it, or(b) refused to accept a payment or performance from the Konver-sionskasse based on a payment made by the debtor, on the groundthat he (the creditor) was unwilling to recognise such payment orperformance as discharging the debt.In the case of securities subject to the validation law for german foreign Currency Bonds, the arrangement set out above shall apply only to such Bonds and Coupons as shall have been validated pursuant to the provisions of such law and of any agreement entered into withthe country of issue respecting the application of such law, or withrespect to the declaratory decrees (Feststellungsbescheide) which the creditor shall have received pursuant to the said law.(2) The amounts so paid by the debtors shall be reimbursed to them outof German public funds.(3) Payments made by the debtor into the Konversionskasse which donot fall within the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) shall be considered as discharging the debt to the extent of such payments.II. Subject to the general provisions contained in paragraph I above : (a) the Federal Government agrees to assume liability for full payment in the due currencies to the foreign creditors of the sums paid into theKonversionskasse by debtors in the Saar in respect of which the foreigncreditors have not received foreign exchange payments or been other-wise satisfied;(b) The Federal Government agrees to assume liability for payment in therespective foreign currencies to the foreign creditors of 60 per cent, ofthe sums paid into the Konversionskasse by debtors in Austria, France,Belgium and Luxemburg in respect of which the foreign creditors havenot received foreign exchange payments or been otherwise satisfied;(c) the Federal Government will negotiate with the foreign creditors&apos; repre-sentatives before the end of December 1952 as regards the implement a-tion of these undertakings.Article 10Payments into the Deutsche VerrechnungskasseThe negotiating parties have discussed the payments made by Germandebtors to the Deutsche Verrechnungskasse which were not paid out to the creditors.In view of the different terms of the contracts between Germany and othercountries whose final implementation is still to be effected, the creditors anddebtors are of the opinion that the questions which have not been clarifiedshould be solved by Governmental negotiations between the Federal republic of Germany and the States concerned.Article 11Hardship ClauseIf and where the financial position of a debtor has been affected by war or the repercussions of war or other extraordinary conditions, to such an extent that the debtor cannot be expected to settle his obligations on theconditions and within the time-limits of this settlement proposal, he shouldbe granted relief. This shall be equitable and take into account the debtorsspecial circumstances. The relief shall be in accordance with the concessions which the debtor has been or may be granted by a German creditor on similargrounds under German Law, especially under the Vertragshilferecht (legislationgoverning contract reliefs).\Vhere_ the creditor and debtor do not reach agreement, the competentGerman Court shall make a decision. The creditor shall have the option ofappealing against the decision of the Lower Court under the provisions ofGerman Law, or, within a period of 30 days after notice of the Court decision has been served, of appealing to the Court of Arbitration constituted accordingto the provisions of Article 17. The decision of the Court of Arbitration shallbe binding.
Article 12Succession to Claims and Debts by Operation of Law(1) Where a foreign creditor has acquired or shall hereafter acquire claims of another foreign creditor by legal succession on death, the claim shall betreated within the framework of this settlement proposal in the same manner as if the original creditor continued to be entitled to it. The same shall applyto similar cases of succession by operation of law.(2) Any person who, by law or by a binding order, is under an obligationto take over the debt, or who has taken it over by contract, shall be liable forthe debt as the successor of the debtor.Article 13Change of Creditor(1) The creditor may assign to some other foreigner the total amount ofhis claim, for which he may demand payment to a foreign country providedthat the assignment (a) takes place within the same currency area,(b) does not entail any modification of the terms underlying the claim,(c) does not result indirectly or directly in settlement of a claim.The competent German authorities will give permission for the assignmentif the conditions laid down in (a) to (c) are fulfilled. Over and above this,they shall give sympathetic consideration to well-founded applications by aforeign creditor for approval of an assignment of partial amount of his claim.By the acquisition of the claim the new creditor shall have the same rightsand obligations as the original creditor. Should the new creditor demand fromthe debtor settlement of the claim in Deutsche Mark, the regulations for&quot; original blocked accounts &quot; shall apply to his blocked account after a periodof three months has elapsed since the change of creditors occurred.(2) As far as the assignment of claims is concerned for which the creditorcan demand payment only in Deutsche Mark, the regulations concerning theuse and assignment of such claims in force at the time in the Federal area and the Western Sectors of Berlin shall be decisive (see Article 19).Article 14Participation of Creditors and Debtors in the Debt Settlement, foreign currency Regulations, Debtor Obligations(1) Creditors and debtors desiring to settle a claim and obligation underthe terms of this settlement proposal, must exchange written declarations tothis effect. The creditors declaration of participation may also be made through an agency established in the creditor country for the transmission ofsuch declarations.(2) The valid Exchange Control Regulations in Germany and abroad,taking into consideration the special facilities and assurances specified in this settlement proposal, shall apply to the relations between the creditor anddebtor.(3) Where the debtor refuses to make a declaration but the creditordeclares himself bound to his own declaration of participation in relation tothe debtor, the German Foreign Exchange Authorities shall at the request ofthe creditor issue to him within the limits of his declaration of participationany necessary foreign exchange licences.Such foreign exchange licences shall place the creditor in the position ofsuing for and recovering the claims lodged by him against the debtor to suchan extent and in such a way as provided in this settlement proposal. Wherethe creditor has not obtained satisfaction by judicial execution, he may with-draw from the debtor his declaration of participaton.The issue of the foreign exchange licence shall not represent any decisionon the existence and amount of the claim.(4) Should the creditor require payment in Deutsche Mark, he shall be obliged to make a written declaration to the debtor that he accepts suchpayment in settlement of his claim.(5) Where the creditor is entitled to require, and requires, payment ina foreign country, the debtor shall be obliged to take all the steps necessary under valid German Foreign Exchange Control Regulations to procure thenecessary instruments of payment in foreign currency.Article 15Settlement of DisputesAny disputes between creditor and debtor as to the existence and theamount of any claims shall be decided by a Court of Law or a Court ofArbitration agreed upon by the parties which is competent according to the
prevailing legal conditions, provided no specific provisions have been laiddown in this settlement proposal.Article 16Mixed commission a Mixed Commission, which shall be composed of an equal number ofrepresentatives of the creditor countries, on the one hand, and of the federal government, on the other hand, as well as of one Chairman, shall be setup to decide differences as to the interpretation of this settlement.It is recommended that the Commission shall be competent to decide inmatters of fundamental importance to the interpretation of this settlementproposal which are submitted to it by the Governments concerned.Where a Government is of the opinion that a case, which is pending inthe Court of Arbitration (Article 17), involves a question of principle, it is recommended that the Government may require the Court of Arbitrationto refer the case to the Mixed Commission. The Court of Arbitration shouldhave the same right.Article 17Court of ArbitrationThe Court of Arbitration referred to in Article 11 shall be composed ofone arbitrator appointed by each of the parties. The two arbitrators shallelect a chairman. Should they not be able to agree on the person, they shall request the President of the International Chamber of Commerce toappoint him.The arbitrators shall possess the qualifications required for holding judicialoffice in their respective countries; this shall not apply to the Chairman.The Court of Arbitration shall decide upon its own procedure. It shall also decide which party shall bear the costs.The German Delegation will advise the Federal Government to make provision that in cases where the parties are unable to make an advance of costs or bear the costs as fixed, the payment of such costs shall be adequatelysettled.On the joint application of the parties, the Court of Arbitration may also decide in other disputes between creditors and debtors.Detailed provisions relative to the Court of Arbitration proposed in thisArticle shall be agreed upon in the Governmental discussions for the implementation of the recommendations of the Conference on GermanExternal Debts.Article 18Payment in Deutsche MarkA payment in Deutsche Mark according to the settlement shall be under-stood as meaning a payment in German currency into an account alreadyheld by a foreign creditor or to be opened in his name with a financialinstitution within the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany or theWestern Sectors of Berlin. The account shall be subject to the valid german foreign Exchange Control Regulations.This shall not exclude the issue of special licences for other forms of payment.Article 19Utilisation of Blocked Deutsche Mark Accounts(1) The foreign creditor of an &quot; original credit account&quot; in german currency shall be permitted to utilise it within the framework of the legal provisions in force in the Federal Republic of Germany and the western sectors of Berlin at the time this settlement comes into effect, including theright to assign such credits to another person outside Germany.(2) The foreign creditor of an &quot; acquired credit account&quot; in german currency shall continue to be permitted to assign his credit to another personoutside Germany.The foreign creditor of such account shall continue to be permitted to utilise his credit mainly for long-term investments in the German economy.(3) The competent German authorities shall draw up the regulations neces-sary to prevent the illegal disposal of credits in German currency and to preclude any other abuses detrimental to the German economy and to the creditors as a whole.

unambiguously into English and French. For this reason, the German textshould be decisive in cases of doubt.The German Delegation, on its side, refers to the necessity for a settle-ment by intergovernmental agreements of cases in which the creditorreceives payments or services from sources other than from the debtor, froma debt successor or from third parties, such as guarantors and creditinsurers.(Signed)  V. Cavendish-Bentinck. (Signed)  Hermann J. Abs.Chairman of negotiating committee D.APPENDIX 7Agreed Recommendations for the Treatment of Payments made to theKonversionskasseI. The German Delegation was of the opinion that the German debtorwas definitively discharged of his debt to the extent of his payments into theKonversionskasse. The creditor representatives, on the other hand, were of the opinion that as a rule such payments into the Konversionskasse wouldnot be recognised as discharging the German debtors under the laws oftheir respective countries. In their desire to put an end to fruitless legaldiscussions, both sides agreed to seek a practical solution which would permitsettlement of the claims of the creditors without unnecessary formalities.Accordingly, the German Delegation and the foreign creditor representa-tives while reserving their respective legal positions, have agreed as follows:  (1) The German debtor undertakes to settle the creditors claim inaccordance with the new settlement terms, regardless of the payments made to the Konversionskasse, to the extent that the creditor-(a) has not in fact received from the Konversionskasse the paymentcorresponding to that made by the debtor to it, or(Jb) refused to accept a payment or performance from the Konver-sionskasse based on a payment made by the debtor, on the groundthat he (the creditor) was unwilling to recognise such paymentor performance as discharging the debt.In the case of securities subject to the validation law for german foreign Currency Bonds, the arrangement set out above shall apply only to such Bonds and Coupons as shall have been validated pur-suant to the provisions of such law and of any agreement enteredinto with the country of issue respecting the application of such law,or with respect to the declaratory decrees (Feststellungsbescheide)which the creditor shall receive pursuant to the said law.(2) The amounts so paid by the debtors shall be reimbursed to them outof German public funds.(3) Payments made by the debtor into the Konversionskasse which do not fall within the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) shall be considered asdischarging the debt to the extent of such payments.II. Subject to the general provisions contained in paragraph I above:  (a) the Federal Government agrees to assume liability for full payment in the due currencies to the foreign creditors of the sums paid intothe Konversionskasse by debtors in the Saar, in respect of which theforeign creditors have not received foreign exchange payments orbeen otherwise satisfied,(Zj) the Federal Government agrees to assume liability for payment inthe due currencies to the foreign creditors of 60 per cent, of the sums paid into the Konversionskasse by debtors in Austria, France,Belgium and Luxemburg in respect of which the foreign creditorshave not received foreign exchange payments or been otherwisesatisfied, and(c) the Federal Government will negotiate with the foreign creditors&apos;representatives before the end of December 1952 as regards the implementation of these undertakings.
APPENDIX 8Agreed Recommendations for the Utilisation of Blocked Deutsche MarkAccountsThe following detailed arrangements have been agreed upon for the utilisation of blocked Deutsche Mark accounts:  (1) The foreign creditor of an &quot; original credit account&quot; in german currency shall be permitted to utilise it within the framework of the regulations in force in the German Federal Republic and the Western Sectors of Berlinat the date on which this settlement comes into effect, including the rightto assign such accounts to another person outside Germany.(2) The foreign creditor of an &quot; acquired credit account&quot; in german currency shall continue to be permitted to assign his account to another person outside Germany.The foreign creditor of such account shall continue to be permitted to utilise his account mainly for long-term investments in the German economy.(3) The competent German authorities shall draw up and issue the regula-tions necessary to prevent the illegal disposal of accounts in German currency and to preclude any other abuses detrimental to the German economy andto the creditors as a whole. Utilisations permitted by a general licence at thetime this settlement comes into force may, in order to ensure proper control,be made dependent upon the issue of a special licence without therebyrestricting the general possibilities of utilisation.(4) The competent German authorities will endeavour to provide facilitiesfor the utilisation of blocked Deutsche Mark accounts to such an extent asthe foreign exchange situation shall permit. They will aim at simplifying thelicence procedure as much as possible.(5) The German Government shall set up an Advisory Committee com-posed of an equal number of representatives of the main creditor countries,on the one hand, and of representatives of the German Federal Republic,on the other, for the discussion of general matters in connection with the utilisation of blocked Deutsche Mark accounts.
