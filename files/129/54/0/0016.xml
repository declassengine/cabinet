Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1952SECRET Copy No.65C. (52) 26628th, July, 1951CABINETEAST-WEST TRADE: PRIOR COMMITMENTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and thePresident of the Board of trade the term &quot; prior commitments &quot; refers to contractual obligations, undertaken by Her Majesty&apos;s Government or United Kingdom firms before the introductionof our export controls, to supply to the Soviet bloc goods now subject to embargo on strategic grounds.Our policy in respect of &quot; prior commitments &quot; as thus defined calls for review in the light of (a) a request from the United States Government that Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and other Governments should reduce their deliveries to theSoviet bloc under prior commitments;(b) the need to give guidance to certain United Kingdom manufacturers of machine tools about the future fulfilment of Soviet bloc orders, which include prior commitments.Previous United Kingdom policy . When they first imposed an embargo on key strategic goods in March 1949,His Majesty&apos;s Government announced that contracts entered into before that date would be honoured. Subsequently, at the end of 1950, Ministers decided to with-hold licences for the export of goods supplied under such contracts to the Soviet blocwhere (a) the strategic importance of the item was so great as to constitute an over-riding objection to its export, or(b) the item was needed for the United Kingdom, Commonwealth or N.A.T.0defence programmes.By the application of these two tests the volume of prior commitments out-standing was reduced by some $6 million. His Majesty&apos;s Government^ action didnot, however, necessarily extinguish the United Kingdom exporters&apos; obligation tosupply the goods.3. On 18th September, 1950 (i.e., before the modification of policy justdescribed) the Government were criticised in the House of Commons by the thenConservative Opposition who opposed the export to Russia and Poland of certainmachine tools then being manufactured under prior commitments by Messrs. CravenBrothers. Following upon the House of Commons debate, export licences were refused in September 1950 for all the machine tools concerned, and for similar orders of other manufacturers. These included some machines on the embargo list, whoseexport is subject to overriding strategic objections (see paragraph 2 (a) above);and others which could be supplied without infraction of our own policy or paris group principles, but which were withheld because of Parliamentary criticism,ostensibly to meet N.A.T.0. defence needs.42649
United States policy. The Battle Act, which was considered by the Cabinet on 3rd January(C.C. (52) 1st Meeting), was designed to make American aid conditional on themaintenance by recipient countries of strict security export controls. The Act makesmo automatic exception in favour of prior commitments. The Cabinet decidedl(C.C. (52) 4th Meeting, Item 4) not to comply with an American request made inJanuary last to suspend shipments under prior commitments of items on the BattleAct embargo list. Other members of the Paris Group entered a similar refusal.The Group, however, agreed to circulate lists of such commitments so that the battle Act Administrator should have full opportunity to consider them. TheUnited Kingdom submitted a list showing the known commitments remaining afterthe application of the two tests referred to in paragraph 2. The effective value ofthe items thus declared was $1-5 million, of which about $0-25 million have since been shipped. The value of our list compares very favourably with those of othercountries (e.g., $6 - 5 million for France, $5 - 8 million for Germany).5. United States Congressional opinion is dissatisfied with the Battle Act.Senator Kem, during the recent debate on the Mutual Security Bill, almost succeeded in reviving his former amendment&quot; which would have made the conditions forreceipt of United States aid very much more stringent. The Senator particularlyattacked this country on the ground, among others, that large numbers of machine tools were still being shipped to Russia. The United States Administration are clearly alarmed at the temper of Congress, and no doubt consider that a sharpreduction in the flow of shipments under prior commitments would be the bes*tdemonstration of the effectiveness of the Battle Act, and the best answer to SenatorKem&apos;s call for drastic action.6. Accordingly, on 24th June, the United States delegate to the Paris Groupasked that the problem of prior commitments &quot; be looked at afresh in its overalldimensions and that in the mutual security interest each country re-examine thesituation once again.&quot; He described a &quot; hard core &quot; of highly strategic items suchas metal-working machinery and rolling-mill equipment, ball-bearings and twoDanish tankers, contracts to supply all of which the United States administration would like to see cancelled. The Group agreed to submit his statement to Govern-ments as requiring urgent and serious attention, and to ask their Governments toinform the Group and the United States Government as soon as possible what action they felt able to take along the lines proposed.7. The American Secretary of State informed the Foreign Secretary and theFrench Foreign Minister at their meeting in London on 27th June that serious political difficulties would arise for the United States Government if it should not prove possible to eliminate a substantial proportion of the prior commitments ofthe Paris Group countries, which he estimated at a total of $22 million, the UnitedKingdom share being given at $5 million.Present Situation8. The American request reaches us at a moment when-we are obliged togive guidance to Craven Brothers and other firms in the machine tool industry.While it has been possible in many cases to divert the goods originally ordered fromthese firms by Soviet bloc customers to N.A.T.O. and other destinations, the con-contractual obligation to the original Soviet bloc buyers has not in all cases beenextinguished. With the progress of defence programmes the future demand from.A.T.O. countries is slackening and firms have enquired whether the originalorders may now be included in their forward production programmes. A numberof the items in question (see paragraph 3 above) are not on the embargo list at all,and thus fall outside the scope of the American request, but since they are associatedin the mind of both Parliament and Congress with our security export controls, itis convenient to deal with them together.Commercial Considerations9. For balance of payments reasons we wish to maintain, and if possibleexpand, trade with the Soviet bloc within the limits set by our security controls.Largely because of our controls, our exports to the Soviet bloc fell from  29 million in 1949 to  15 million in 1951, and further reductions through the cancellation of existing contracts will endanger our essential imports.  We must also bear in
Illlind that the addition of new items to the embargo list may give rise to a furthercrop of prior commitments, the cancellation of which would involve further reductions in the volume of our trade.10. By breaking contracts we undermine confidence in the undertakings ofUnited Kingdom firms ejten where these are given with official approval. This isa deterrent to trade even&quot;in non-strategic goods and may divert future orders toother countries who are more punctilious. At the same time, we invite reprisalsby the Russians, who have so far been careful to honour their obligations.11. Moreover, cancellations may involve our firms in financial loss whichmay lead, under an undertaking given by the late Government, to claims on theExchequer for indemnification. Firms may find it difficult to dispose of &quot; tailor-made &quot; items.12. In the particular case of machine tools, we are dealing with a traditionalUnited Kingdom export to Eastern Europe. In .1951 the Soviet bloc countriestook 10 per cent, of our total exports of machine tools. In the depression of the1930&apos;s the figure was as high as 60 per cent. The loss of the Soviet bloc market would harm the long-term interests of the machine tool industry.Strategic and Political Considerations13. Our own security must take precedence of all other considerations whereprior commitments of major strategic importance are involved. But we alone canbe the judges of what these items are. We have reviewed our list and have cometo the conclusion that none of the items are of sufficient strategic importance tojustify cancelling the prior commitment.14. The members of the Paris Group have received a clear warning from theUnited States Government that insistence upon fulfilling prior commitments mayimperil the programme of American aid. The amount at risk in the case of theUnited Kingdom is $516 million in 1952-53, the receipt of which is essential to thebalancing of our dollar accounts, and the execution of our defence programme; aswell as an uncertain amount (probably about $600 million) in military end items.The risk need not, however, in our view, be taken too seriously. The United StatesGovernment has estimated the value of our prior commitments at $5 million. Thefigure should be $1-5 million. The difference between these figures arises largely because the Americans included the maximum value of possible deliveries of coppersemi-manufactures to Poland under the Trade Agreement of 1949. In fact nocommercial contracts are involved, and the obligation is virtually a dead letteragainst which no more than token deliveries are made annually. In reply to theUnited States Government this discrepancy could be pointed out and the limited extent of our remaining commitments emphasised. The Administration will ofcourse be able if they choose to take credit at home for the apparent reductionachieved.15.   To permit the export of machine tools which the late Government refusedto licence (see paragraph 3 above) is a potential source of Parliamentary embarrassing-rassment.   But it may be necessary to accept this in the interests of securing a&apos; consistent and defensible policy.Proposed Policy.16. After weighing the considerations set out above, we conclude that our good name and our economic interests alike call for a reaffirmation of our policyof fulfilling prior commitments.17. We recognise, however, that where the goods concerned are of over-riding strategic importance, security considerations must take precedence, and thatin such cases export licences should, despite the existence of a prior commitment,be refused.18. The consistent application of these principles will imply that we shouldbe prepared to grant export licences for prior commitments where the goods con-cerned are not of overriding strategic importance, and for machine tools not on the embargo list. In considering the issue of such licences, we should continue to giveprecedence to the claims of our own and Allied defence programmes. These claimswill tend to diminish in volume with the passage of time.
Recommendations noi19.  We accordingly recommend:  rhn(a) That the Cabinet should endorse the policy proposed in paragraphs 16-18above; and 00(b) That the Foreign Secretary should be authorised to reply to the UnitedStates Government  ns(i) explaining this policy; and av.(ii) drawing attention to their over-estimate of the value of our totalprior commitments, and to the reductions already effected.A. E.P. T.28th July, 1952.
