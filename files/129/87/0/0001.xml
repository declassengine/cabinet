(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY CF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCONFIDENTIALC.(57) 10125th April, 1957CAB INETVATICAN REPRESENTATION IN THEUNITED kingdom memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs have received a number of representations to the effect that achange in the status of the Vatican Representative in the United kingdom is now desirable.2.     There has been a British Minister at the Vatican since 1914.    Since1938 the Vatican has maintained an Apostolic Delegate in London, but he is strictly an ecclesiastical functionary and has no diplomatic status, although he has free access to the Departments of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.3.      It is plainly anomalous that our Minister at the Vatican has fulldiplomatic status and the Vatican representative in London has not.     Underthe Lateran Treaty with Italy in 1929 the Vatican acquired the position of anindependent State, although admittedly it is sui generis.4.     The Vatican has not asked for diplomatic status for its representative in the United Kingdom.    But representatives of the Roman Catholiccommunity in this country periodically raise the question with the ForeignCffice to urge that an Internuncio (who would rank as a Minister) bereceived.    The objections to a change relate to domestic rather thanforeign policy, and arise from the post-Reformation Frotestant tradition of the United Kingdom and The Queen&apos;s position as Head of the Church ofEngland.    I have however ascertained from the Law Officers of the Crownthat, in their view, there is no legal or constitutional objection.5.     When the Whips were consulted in 1953 they thought that there wouldbe strong objection in the country a&amp;fi in Parliament to the appointment of aforeigner as Internuncio, but not to the appointment of a British subject or commonwealth citizen.    It would hardly however be possible to give aBritish subject diplomatic privilege in the United Kingdom or to insist thatan Internuncio should always be a Commonwealth citizen.   I doubt whether there would now be such a strong objection to a foreigner.6.      The Archbishop of Canterbury has made it plain informally that hewould object to the reception of an Internuncio.    He has asked to be given  an opportunity to state his views before any commitment is entered into.I have also received a number of letters from Members of Parliament andProtestant bodies, stating their objections to a change, of which there havebeen rumours in the Press.    Certain Ulster Unionists have indicated thatthey would be violently opposed to a change.COPY NO.
7.     A further point is that an Internuncio would probably absent himself from national celebrations at e. go  Westminster Abbey or St. Faul&apos;s attended by the Diplomatic Corps as a whole, and this might be held to be a slightto The Queen.8.      From the foreign affairs point of view no change seems urgently required.    The present system, though illogical, functions effectively andthe Vatican are not pressing us to accept an Internuncio.9.     Accordingly I could summarise the arguments as follows:-In favour of an Internuncio.-(a) It is a logical measure of reciprocity to the Vatican.(b) It would please Roman Catholics at home.(c) It would please certain Western European and Latin-American countries.Against an Internuncio:-(a) There is no pressing demand for it.(b) It might relight the flames of a religious controversywhich (for example in Liverpool) has died down even within my own lifetime.(c) It would offend some Frotestants in the United Kingdom.In Ulster, it might have a serious political effect for a time.10.    On balance my own view is that we should make no change.     Weshould not disclose the fact that the Cabinet have discussed the matter.I should tell the Duke of Norfolk and his friends, when they raise it againwith me, that, although I am not unsympathetically inclined, I have takencertain soundings, and feel that some more time must elapse before thematter can be usefully considered.     Fremature action of this nature would do more harm than good.S.L.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.24th April, 1957.
