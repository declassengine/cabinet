Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 14521st June, 1957CABINETOVERSEA INFORMATION services memorandum by the Prime minister the report on the Oversea Information Services by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster&apos;s Committee (C. (57) 141) constitutes the first comprehensivesurvey of these services since the Drogheda report in 1953. The Cabinet will,I am sure, agree that it is a valuable review of a subject which is of increasing importance and complexity.2. I doubt whether the Cabinet need consider in detail the individualrecommendations which the report lists in its Appendix. They may be content to reach agreement in principle that an expansion on the scale indicated in thatAppendix is desirable if we are to maintain our hold on public opinion overseas ata time when we can no longer maintain as impressive a show of power in other respects as in the past. But the report raises, in addition, certain general issues ofprinciple which I have discussed with the Ministers primarily concerned; and itmay be helpful if I indicate the provisional views which I have formed.The Teaching of English3. I think that the Cabinet will be particularly impressed by that sectionof the report (paragraphs 20-27) which discusses the means by which we canpromote the teaching of English overseas.  Our own language is one of the most
valuable of our exports and it is in our interest, commercially as well as politically,to secure its wider use throughout the world. I hope that high priority may begiven to the measures proposed in this section of the report; and progress shouldbe kept under regular review.The B.B.C.4. Relations between the Government and the B.B.C. have, from time totime, been less than satisfactory; and this situation was aggravated during the suez period, when there was a certain tendency to regard the B.B.C. asinsufficiently concerned to present the Governmenfs case, as distinct from thecase of their critics, to the world. Whatever the rights and wrongs of that particular episode may be, I believe that we should be wise to accept the generaldoctrine expounded in paragraphs 30-34 of the report and to make a fresheffort to establish a relationship of genuine collaboration with the Corporation.This relationship, however, should recognise the responsibility of each party.We for our part, might well take this opportunity to renew publicly our undertaking to respect the independence and integrity of the B.B.C. and to refrain from any attempt to control the detailed content of their programmes. On their part, however, the Corporation should whole-heartedly observe the principle of the1952 Licence and Agreement, whereby the Government are entitled to prescribe the. countries to which the Corporation^ main effort should be directed. Inparagraphs 42-46 the report indicates the way in which the existing structure of oversea programmes could be so adjusted, with relatively little additional expenditure, as to shift the emphasis away from Europe towards other moreimportant and more vulnerable areas. We should make it clear to the B.B.C. thatwe expect them to accept this degree of redeployment of their effort and toco-operate in making it fully effective.5. At the same time, we should consider carefully the risk that the ratherunsatisfactory situation which has grown up in sound broadcasting may recur inthe case of television. The report recommends, in paragraph 65, that the B.B.C.(and I.T.A.) should be left to exploit the commercial market overseas to themaximum permitted by their own resources, but that Exchequer assistance shouldbe confined to the preparation of television material specifically for showingoverseas, as a deliberate instrument of information policy, and that this work should be entrusted to the Central Office of Information (C.O.I.) in order thatGovernment control over the content of the material can be ensured from the outset. This decision will not be welcome to the B.B.C., who regard themselves as entitled to an Exchequer grant to enable them to develop the production of television material for oversea showing; and we may expect that the corporation will vigorously criticise a refusal by the Government to make them a grant of thiskind. Nevertheless, there are strong arguments, at this early stage in thedevelopment of television, for the Government keeping under their own control the content of programmes subsidised with Exchequer money. It is, however,important that, if the Cabinet accept these arguments, the arrangements shouldbe presented as suggested in paragraph 67 of the report not as a decision
10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,20th June, 1957.&quot; against &quot; the B.B.C. and &quot; in favour of &quot; the C.O.I., but rather as a sensible first step in a new and experimental form of enterprise, which can be reviewed in thelight of developments.The Financial Implications6. The oversea information services are estimated to cost, in the current financial year, slightly over  13 millions. The proposals which the report regardsas of first priority would cost about  1,850,000 in a full year (which would notbe reached, in some cases, for several years). The total expenditure would thenbe of the order of  15 millions. This is not a small sum. But, subject to whateverviews the Chancellor of the Exchequer may express, the Cabinet may wish toauthorise an expansion of this order, provided that : (a) the possibility of further economies in the existing services is vigorously pursued. The report notes severalexamples of potential economies of this kind, particularly the information servicesmaintained by the Foreign Office in Germany; (b) the expansion should not proceed beyond the point at which it implies an ultimate rate of expenditure of 15 millions a year (with due allowance for rising costs in the interval) withoutfurther reference to the Cabinet. This authority should suffice for the rest of the lifetime of this Parliament, after which it might be appropriate to review theservices afresh.7. Provision of this kind would not cover the programme of capitalexpansion, which the report estimates as requiring about  5^ millions, spreadover some fifteen years. There seems little doubt that an extensive re-equipment of the B.B.C.&apos;s installations in this country is long overdue, and that there is, inaddition, no alternative to the construction of several relay stations abroad if theCorporation^ programmes are to compete effectively in more distant parts of theworld. The Cabinet may agree that the proposal should be approved in principle,but that detailed discussions should be begun with the B.B.C. with a view toagreeing a phased order of priorities based on a specific figure of capital expenditureeach year. We shall have to decide what this figure should be.H. M.
