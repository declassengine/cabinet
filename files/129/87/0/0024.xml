(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE property  OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(57) 12421st May, 1957BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS corporation memorandum by the Minister of Transport and civil aviation on 18th April I put to the Economic Policy Committee a proposal of the British Overseas Airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.) to invest atotal of  2 millions in the Turkish National Airline (T. H.Y.), in orderto enable that airline to procure Viscount aircraft.    The corporation have negotiated a provisional agreement with the Turks under whichthey would invest  f million in the equity of T.H.Y. and would make a if millions loan to be in the form of a debenture repayable in sterlingover ten years.2.   As far as civil aviation is concerned, Turkey is most important as a staging post to B.O.A.C., especially in the present Middle Eastsituation;  and an arrangement with the Turkish Airline would feedtraffic into B.O.A.C&apos;s trunk routes.    If B.O.A.C. do not make the investment, the Turks will turn to the Americans, to whom thesecommercial advantages would be diverted.3.   The Foreign Office see considerable political advantage in theproposals and, conversely, serious political disadvantages if theprovisional offer has to be withdrawn at this late date.4.   The disadvantages are entirely financial and arise from Turkey&apos;balance of payments difficulties;  the situation is that in the foreseeable future they will have a substantial sterling deficit and that, this being so, any sterling payments made to B.O.A.C. could only be at theexpense of other United Kingdom creditors, including the Exchequer,which has guaranteed a large part of the debts through the export credits Guarantee Department (E.C.G.D.).5.    The Economic policy Committee agreed in principle, that B.O.A.C.should be authorised to invest a total of  2 millions in T.H.Y., butthat the  if millions loan should be expressed in such a form thatits repayment should not be accorded priority over existingcommercial debts.    Possibilities suggested by the Committee were -(a) leasing Viscount aircraft to the Turks;    and(b) B.O.A.C. investing the entire  2 millions in the equity of the Company.It was agreed that the form to be taken by the proposed investment should be urgently considered by officials. (E.A.(57) 8th Meeting, Item 4).copy NO.CABINETS&apos;3
6.   The following conclusions have emerged from official discussions:-(i)  Neither of the Committee&apos;s suggestions is practicable.E.O.A.C. discussed the possibility of leasing the air-craft with the Turka, who firmly declined it.    Thesuggestion that the entire  2 millions should be invested in the equity of T.H. Y. is commerciallyunacceptable to B.O.A.C.(ii)   The suggestion has been made that B.O.A.C. should enter into a supplementary exchange of letters toprovide that the deal should be subject to existing arrangements for the settlement of debts continuing to be maintained.    This does not solve the problemtor two reasons.     First, it takes no account of firmTurkish commitments which will involve sterlingpayments at future dates.    Second, it would inevitably produce a result unsatisfactory eitherto the Board of Trade or to B.O.A.C.:   if theTurks honour the proviso B.O.A.C. would beunsatisfied because they would receive no payments,and if the Turks did not honour the proviso thesituation would be unsatisfactory to the Board ofTrade.7.   I am fully satisfied that there is no way in which the proposed arrangements can be so modified as to make them acceptable both to the Board of Trade and to B.O.A.C.    There are therefore fourpossible alternatives before us:-(a) The proposals can be allowed to drop.(b) B.O.A.C,&apos;s provisional agreement with the Turkscan be approved and the financial disadvantagesaccepted.-(c) Her Majesty&apos;s Government can make a loan tothe Turks on the same lines as in the case ofthe recent deal in destroyers, i. e. with norepayments for say ten years;  since I have no statutory power to make such a loan I take it that in this event the expenditure should be borne on the Foreign Office Vote.(d) An attempt can be made to press B.O.A.C. to investthe full  2 millions in the equity of T.H.Y.8. The Foreign Office regard alternative (a) as politicallyunacceptable.    I myself am very much opposed to alternative (d).B.O.A.C, regard investment of more than  f million in the equity ofT.H.Y. as commercially indefensible (the security would, of course,be very poor) and are for their part ready to drop the proposalsrather than increase this sum;  it is essentially for political reasonsthat these proposals cannot now be allowed to lapse and, this being so,it would surely be inequitable to place upon E.O.A.C. a financial burdenvery much greater than they consider commercially sound.    I have no power to direct them to take such a step.    I therefore suggest to mycolleagues that they should decide between alternatives (b) and (c).
-i s5 hi9.   We must settle this long-outstanding problem without further delay; the Turkish Government have expressed extreme disappointmentat our failure to give them an answer.H.W.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1.20th May, 1957.
