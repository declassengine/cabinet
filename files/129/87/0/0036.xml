BRITISH EVACUEES FROM egypt memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in view of the interruption of the talks in Rome with Egyptianofficials, I have been considering what should be done to alleviate further the position of the British subjects who have had their assets in Egyptsequestrated.    We shall obviously be under strong pressure to make further concessions.2. On 10th May the Cabinet accepted the view that direct Exohequeradvances against assets in Egypt should, if possible, be avoided.(C. C. (57) 39th Conclusions, Minute 4).    These advances might prejudice the pursuit of claims; they might make it difficult for the Governmentto avoid accepting an eventual liability to pay 100 per cent compensationfor loss of assets;  and they would constitute a formidable precedent.IMPROVEMENTS IN PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS3. On the basis that this general policy is maintained, certain measures outlined below can be taken.Suez Contractors&apos; Employees4. When this matter was discussed on 10th May, the cabinet recognised that, owing to the Governmenfs special responsibilities, itwould be justifiable to accord priority to the claims of the Contractors&apos;employees.    Because a special case can be made out, it is hoped thatconcessions to the employees will not have serious repercussionselsewhere.    It is proposed to offer to make advances equal to 100 percent of the assessed value of property and effects left behind in Egypt.The value of this property (nearly all of which has already been assessed by a firm appointed by the Contractors) is of the order of  425,000.In addition the employees had  100,000 on deposit in Egyptian Banks but,in accordance with the Cabinefs views on 10th May, no advances are proposed in respect of funds in Egyptian Banks.5. It has been suggested that, in return for full compensationfor the effects, the employees should assign their claims to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment.    This is not a desirable course.    It is probable that in thelong run Government claims will not have as good a chance of being settled as private claims.    But in any case it is undesirable that theGovernment should take over these claims because:-, ?(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) $----.--------------------------------------------------------------------m ....secret.(57) 136 COPY NO.   a ^5th June, 1957CABINET
(a) it is essential to avoid any precedent which mightbe quoted against us in the wider context;  and(b) the assets, if recovered, will be of little value and difficult to identify.It is also necessary to provide for the possibility that the Egyptiansmay in the end pay in cash something on these claims.    Accordingly,sums paid to the employees by Her Majesty&apos;s Government will beregarded as ex gratia advances.    The terms on which advances can best be made on this basis will be discussed with a view, inter alia,to securing repayment to Her Majesty&apos;s Government in appropriate cases.Advances by Banks against Assets in this Country6. Proposals made by Barclays (D.C.O.) and some other banksto make advances against securities which they are holding to the orderof banks in Egypt, on account of refugees from Egypt, were set outin paragraphs 9-11 of the official report attached to C. (57) 115.The banks proposing the scheme hold 400 individual accounts,comprising securities worth  1,800,000.    (The proposal for advancesapplies only to these accounts and excludes an additional  850,000belonging to corporate institutions).    These banks are prepared to make advances at a nominal rate of interest to individuals, provided thatthey receive a Treasury guarantee against loss.7. The Bank of England are not very keen about the scheme.The Midland Bank do not propose to participate - as it happens, theyhold very few accounts of this kind.    The securities are registered inthe names of the banks in Egypt and are not in the last resort a very effective security against the proposed advances.\8. At the same time, it is public knowledge that a scheme ofthis kind has been put forward by the banks and, to the ordinary man,it is difficult to explain why the individuals concerned cannot actuallybe given the securities which are held on their behalf.    The treasury solicitor has advised that an Exchequer guarantee would requireParliamentary authority but that this could be given by introducing anew subhead into the Foreign Office Vote and taking a token supplementaryVote.9. As a result of the Rome conversations, the Egyptian Director-General of Exchange Control undertook to look into the possibility of releasing United Kingdom owned securities at present held by Londonbanks to the order of banks in Egypt.    Until it can be seen whether anything comes of this, the balance of advantage seems to lie againstopening negotiations with Barclays Bank and the other associated banks,and the Bank of England, with a view to working out a scheme.    If wecome to such negotiations, one of the questions to be discussed is the size of the advances in relation to the securities held.    Perhaps at thisstage it would be undesirable to go above 50 per cent of the value ofthe security.    Whether there should be a limit on the size of any individual advance would depend on information about the size of theindividual accounts.
Grants by the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board10. Expenditure by the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board isat present in excess of  i00,000 a month.    The Home Office have,proposed a number of extensions of the present activities of theBoard.    They are set out in Appendix I.    They are comparatively minor in character but will ease the Board&apos;s task and facilitate the resettlement of the British subjects concerned.11. The Home Office have also made a more fundamentalproposal, namely that the payment of resettlement grants, whileremaining dependent upon the applicant having found himself a job,should no longer be dependent upon his having already foundaccommodation.    In other words, when an applicant has a job and seems likely to be able to support himself, the Board should give him the fullscale of resettlement grant at a fixed rate to cover both accommodation and furniture, and inform him that the Board will no longer accept him as a liability.    It would then be left to the applicant to use this moneyas best he can to obtain accommodation.    Under this proposal theaverage family group, receiving the maximum grant for accommodation and furnishing, would be given a lump sum of  1,000, for which theywould have to take themselves off the Board&apos;s books.12.        This proposal would be generally recognised as generous,while at the same time it would relieve the Board of continuingliabilities which are becoming of serious concern to it.    Even with the comparatively generous limits within which it is already able to make payments, the Board has not succeeded in getting more than some 30families finally resettled and off its books altogether.    The Home Officebelieve that about 500 families might be taken off the Board&apos;s handsquite quickly if the new policy was adopted, at a cost of some  500,000.This might encourage other families to qualify and so stop a dangeroustrend which is showing signs of developing, for refugees to be unwilling to find work or leave hostels.    The final cost of the operation mightbe between  1 million and  if millions.GENERAL SCHEME OF ADVANCES AGAINSTSEQUESTRATED ASSETS13. It was suggested in the discussion on 10th May that steps should be taken to set up the nucleus of an organisation which, if need arose, would be able to operate a general scheme of advances againstsequestrated assets.14, There is no semi-independent body at present in existencewhich could, without legislation, properly administer such a scheme.A special organisation could, however, quickly be set up as part of an existing Government Department and could make use of staff madeavailable by the Foreign Office, the Board of Trade and the War DamageCommission.    The question of legislation needs further examination,depending upon the nature of the organisation which it is proposed toset up, but it is thought that, for an ad hoc arrangement of the kindindicated above, sufficient Parliamentary cover would be obtained throughthe inclusion in Estimates of the necessary financial provision.    Adecision would be required which Minister should be answerable toParliament for the work.    In my view it should be the Foreign Secretary.15. I remain of the opinion that it would be injudicious at this stage to introduce a general scheme for advances against assets.    I have,
however, set out in Appendix II some comments and suggestions onthe scheme worked out by officials and appended to C. (57) 115.    In spiteof the fact that the Rome negotiations have been suspended I still shouldriot favour such a scheme, but should prefer to limit our action to whatis put forward in paragraphs 4 and 5 and 10-12 above.    A general schemwould imply that Her Majesty&apos;s Government was itself taking on theliability to compensate for losses sustained by British subjects andthe prospect, already slight, of obtaining compensation from egypt would be further prejudiced.     In addition we should have made it verydifficult for ourselves to escape paying full compensation if the egyptians do not agree to do so.     This is not the only case in which british assets abroad have been seized and we should be initiatinga new policy if we decided to compensate fully the losers in theabsence of any compensation from the country responsible.16. I therefore recommend that my colleagues agree to immediate action at this stage being restricted to advances to the employees of Suez contractors (paragraphs 4 and 5) and the substantial increases proposed in the financial powers of the Anglo-egyptian resettlement Board  (paragraphs 10-12).P.T.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.5th June, 1957.APPENDIX ISCOPE OF ASSISTANCE GIVEN BY ANGLO-EGYPTIAN RESETTLEMENT board in view of the Cabinefs decision that the scope and scale of payments by the Board should be sympathetically re-examined asan interim measure while negotiations are going on with the egyptian government for a general settlement, the following recommendations are made for extension of the Board&apos;s present capacity to help persons affected by recent events in Egypt.1.   Resettlement(a) Accommodation allowanceThe maximum grant of  400 to cover a deposit to a building society for the purchase of a house should be exclusive of legal expenses, for which a further grant should be made up to  100.(b) Furnishing allowanceThe authorised rate of payments should be increased as follows:-
(i)  for accommodation in a whole house or half a house:    250 for first two adults (e.g. man and wife,or widow and her mother) or for a single adult with one child;  plus  75 for each additional adult and  50for each additional child;   up to a maximum of  500for each family;(ii)  for accommodation in one or two rooms only:a maximum of  250 ;(iii)  for furnished accommodation:    75 for a single person;    100 for a married couple or family.(c) Business grants and loansThe Board&apos;s discretion should be extended to making grants of up to  750 and loans of up to  2,000 in addition where necessary.Where the Board think larger grants or loans justified, theyshould refer the cases to the Home Office, who will seekTreasury approval.(d) In assessing an applicanfs eligibility for resettlementpayments, the Board should continue to disregard, as a working rule, money or other assets upto  2,000.(e) The Board should continue to take into account, in assessing an applicanfs eligibility for resettlement payments,any sums he has been given by way of indemnity (by his formeremployer, for example) but need not for this purpose take accountof any sums he has been lent.2.   Persons eligible for Assistance by the board the Board need not restrict its activities to people who had come to this country as a result of recent events in Suez.Where need is proved, the Board should help any person inthis country who is suffering by being cut off from his property and assets as a direct result of recent events in Egypt.3.    Persons AbroadThe Board&apos;s authority to make advances to pensioners,whether of the Egyptian Government or of any other concernin Egypt, extends to any kind of pensioner resident outside theUnited Kingdom.    No other regular or maintenance payments should be made to any person outside the United Kingdom butpersons whom the Board are assisting to emigrate, and to whom they are already authorised in certain circumstances to makeresettlement grants, should be given in addition a lump summaintenance payment where the Board are satisfied that that isnecessary to assist them to settle in their new country.
APPENDIX IISCHEMES FOR ADVANCES IN C. (57) 1151.        The scheme is probably over-genercus in the higher reaches,though perhaps not generous enough at the &quot;bottom.     The maximum advancemight bo restricted to  4,000 (as opposed to the  10,000 which wassuggested).     But for claims up to  1,000 a rate of advance might be,say, 90 per cent as opposed to 75 per cent.     In greater detail thescheme might be as fellows:-Claim value (excluding	Rate of		Cumulativecertain items)	advance	Maximum	Maximum. , . 		 	 0 - 1,000	90	900	9001,000 - 3,000 as above plus	50	1,000	1,9003,000 - 5,000 as above plus	30	600	2,5005,000 - 10,000 as above plus	15	750	3,25010,000 - 20,000 as above plus	7i	750	4,000Above 20,000	Not applic-	4,000	4,000able.Under this plan, all would bo eligible for seme payment, however largethe v*\lue of his assets.2. Thus modified the scheme might cost about  4 millions.     Itwould of course be necessary, in making payments to have regard to any payments made under the propesals outlined in paragraphs 4-12 ef thememorandum above.3.        Under any scheme, the implications of the repayment of advanceswould have to be carefully explained to those concerned.     An owner ofproperty in Egypt who wished to resume possession in the event of de-sequestration weuld be ill-advised to accept an advance on the security ofthe property, since he oould presumably repay only by selling the property.Difficult questions about repayment weuld arise if, as is possible, the egyptians desequestrated property or paid compensation but refused toallow funds to leave Egypt.
