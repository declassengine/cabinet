Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1957SECRET /2t/-Pbv&quot; Copy No. 57C. (57) 14321st June, 1957CABINETDISARMAMENTNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe discussions in the Disarmament Sub-Committee have now reached acritical point as a result of the Soviet Governments professed acceptance of controlover the cessation of nuclear tests coupled with the United States Governmentswillingness to accept a moratorium on nuclear tests for 10 months in certaincircumstances. A paper setting out the issues involved will be circulated in timefor consideration by my colleagues. Meanwhile, I circulate the texts ofMr. Stassen&apos;s informal memorandum to the Soviet Delegation of 31st May andMr. Zorin&apos;s Aide-Memoire of 7th June.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,20th June, 1957.51788B
May 31, 1957INFORMAL memorandum to: The Chairman of the USSR Delegation.From: The Chairman of the United States Delegation.The Chairman of the United States Delegation is pleased to inform theChairman of the USSR Delegation that following a recent thorough review by theUnited States Government of the various questions and proposals in relationship to disarmament and decisions by President Eisenhower during the recent recessof the Sub-Committee, the United States Delegation is authorised to resume negotiations in an endeavour to conclude a partial agreement for a soundsafeguarded first step in disarmament. In these resumed negotiations the UnitedStates Delegation is further authorised to meet half-way on a reasonable basis the positions and proposals of the other members of the Sub-Committee including theUSSR.The Chairman of the United States Delegation therefore in this first substantivediscussion since the recess presents this informal memorandum to the Chairmanof the USSR Delegation and engages in this discussion between the two delegations.1. The United States recognises a certain validity in the comment advanced in the April 30, 1957, proposal of the USSR to the effect that the Soviet Union hasa territory much larger than that of the United States and has lengthy frontiers.The United States Delegation responds to the other comment in this regard in theSoviet proposal, however, that the collective security arrangements in which theUnited States has entered are for the purposes of defence and are not to beconsidered as a threat to the USSR or to any State which abides by the Charter ofthe United Nations. The United States Delegation further notes that while theterritory of the United States is smaller and its frontiers are shorter than those ofthe Soviet Union, it also has in other respects a different strategic position. Manyof the natural resources on which its highly productive economy depends are located in distant areas of the world. It has vital interests and defensive treaty associationsin a number of regions, and the defence arrangements for these vital interests andthe defensive treaty commitments in fact in many circumstances require relativelymore of armed forces and armaments than does an internal security arrangementwherein natural resources and vital interests are within a national border, eventhough that national border may be extensive. For these and many other reasons the United States Delegation cannot agree to any recognition of different forcelevels for the USSR than for the United States. In fact for over two years, since may 10, 1955, the USSR has been making proposals and negotiating on a basis which recognised the equality of force levels for the USSR and the United States.2. Nevertheless the United States has taken into account the Soviet Union&apos;sreaffirmation of first stage reductions to force levels of 2\ million men for the USSRand the United. States, but coupled with a statement of the Soviet interest in forcelevels lower than this, to 1-1 - 5 million men in what is described as a second stage of the implementation of the partial measures.One of the important reasons for the United States proposal that the first stepof reductions should be of a more moderate nature to the extent of a force levelof 2\ million men has been the essential requirement of adequate inspection inrelationship to any disarmament commitment, and an awareness that the USSR didnot wish to consent to a comprehensive initial inspection.3. Therefore the United States Delegation now states to the Soviet Delegationthat on condition the first reduction under a partial agreement is carried throughsuccessfully to the level of 2\ million for armed forces, and the partial inspectionis satisfactorily implemented and the essential States have adhered to the treaty,the United States Delegation would be prepared to negotiate for further reductions in armed forces and armaments. The United States Delegation views favourablythe possibility of a second reduction under such circumstances to not less than2 -1 million men, and if this is executed successfully and the inspection expandedsatisfactorily it would be the hope of the United States Delegation that further reductions in armed forces might be negotiated, but not below 1-7 million.Reductions in armaments would be made correspondingly. The levels to correspond
for the United Kingdom and France would be negotiated with these States. the legitimate security requirements of the nations concerned would be taken fully intoaccount in light of responsibilities for individual and collective self-defence andin light of the political and military situations existing at those times.4. In the matter of the corresponding reduction in armaments the UnitedStates Delegation has also taken into account the Soviet proposal that the firstreduction in armaments should be of a greater amount than suggested by theUnited States, and that the specific levels be reduced by 15 per cent.One of the difficulties with this approach of 15 per cent., since the USSR is onlyproposing partial inspection during this first reduction, is that it is not possibleto know what the percentage of 15 represents. The United States Delegation isfrank to state that it does not know the precise amounts of Soviet armament, andat the same time it recognises the Soviet reluctance from its viewpoint to report itscomplete armament at the present time.Nevertheless the United States Delegation wishes to move to meet the Sovietin regard to armaments reduction. The United States therefore suggests thatarmaments to be reduced should be negotiated in specific quantities. The UnitedStates is prepared to favourably consider initial reductions of substantial amounts of specific quantities of identified types of armaments significant in kind and of post-World War II manufacture. If the Soviet will present its proposal in the formof such a specific list which it is prepared to reduce in relationship to the reductionin military forces to 2\ million, the United States will present in return a proposedlist of armaments which it would be prepared to reduce likewise substantial in amount of specific quantities of identified types of armaments significant in kind and of post-World War II manufacture which it is prepared to have considered inrelationship to its first reductions to the force level of 2\ million. Such specificlists would then be negotiated in relation to each other without regard to anypercentage figure. Upon agreement on such a specific list there would be no possibility of later disagreement or confusion which might arise on any type ofpercentage calculation or less precise formula.5. The armaments in these agreed lists could then be reduced by placing the items in the disarmament depots under international supervision in the fulfilment ofthe partial agreement in accordance with a reasonable time schedule. Their laterdisposal could likewise be by agreement when both sides certify that they have carried out the required reduction, and the international inspectors confirm thatthese armaments have been delivered to the disarmament depots.6. The United Kingdom and France and other States would likewise presentlists for first reductions of armaments which would need to be approved in thenegotiations for their adherence to the agreement as the basis for their firstreductions in armaments in relationship to their first stage levels of armed forces.7. It is believed that this more simple and clear procedure will be better than any that either side has suggested heretofore. In the United States view it isimportant that if a first step agreement is reached there be the maximum chancefor its mutual fulfilment without any unnecessary room for subsequentdisagreements over detail or for doubts to arise during the fulfilment.8. In relationship to such reductions in armed forces and armaments, the consequential reduction in military expenditures should not present any difficultnegotiating problem, the principal point for adjustment being the method and extent to which the budget and financial records would be reviewed in such a first step partial agreement.9. The United States maintains its capability in nuclear weapons solely fordefensive purposes. The United States is therefore not willing to completelyrenounce the use of such nuclear weapons and finds unacceptable the soviet proposal for such a complete prohibition of use. To the United States it isunthinkable for it to take a commitment which on its face would mean that eventhough its armed forces or its vital interests or its collective security partners areattacked by large military forces, and, in fact, even if such attacking forces included the use of nuclear weapons, yet there would be a clause in a treaty that the UnitedStates was prohibited from the use of nuclear weapons.10. Thus the United States will not agree to a - partial agreement which includes such a clause or such a declaration.51788 b 2
11. On the other hand, the United States Delegation recognises a certainvalidity to the comment of the Chairman of the Soviet Delegation that Article 51of the United Nations Charter was drafted and agreed to prior to the advent of nuclear weapons, and that technically a reference to Article 51 means that a borderincident or a very small armed attack across the border could be taken to authorisethe use of nuclear weapons. The United States has no such intentions. TheUnited States has demonstrated time and again the restraint with which it uses its military forces.The United States further recognises the vagueness of the word &quot; aggression.&quot;The United States therefore expresses its willingness, if the Soviet wishes to do so,to include within a partial agreement a provision, the precise wording of which isto be negotiated, which would have the effect that all signators agree that they are prohibited from the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons of all types includingaerial bombs, rockets carrying atomic or hydrogen warheads, irrespective of range,atomic artillery, and any other atomic and hydrogen weapons except (a) an individual or collective self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charterif an armed attack occurs which includes the use of nuclear weapons, or (b) if suchan armed attack is of such a nature and magnitude that the attack cannot feasiblybe repelled without the use of nuclear weapons, in the decision of the using State.12. This formulation adopts indirectly a Soviet suggestion of a commitmentnot to be the first to use nuclear weapons, and combines it with a provision which to the United States is an inseparable parallel, especially when viewed with theprospect of reducing armed forces and armaments. Reference is made to the rightto repel an armed attack when it is of such nature and magnitude that it cannotbe otherwise feasibly repelled. It is the view of the United States Delegation thatthe best safeguard against the use of nuclear weapons is to prevent the beginningof armed attack and the beginning of war. Any war carries within itself greatdangers of spreading. Any war in the modern age carries within it a great dangerof becoming a nuclear war. Therefore, the United States intends to hold its military strength, whether of its present size, or of a reduced size under a partialagreement for disarmament, in a manner which discourages any miscalculation byany State of an unfortunate initiation of an armed attack contrary to the united nations Charter.13. The question of nuclear tests has been discussed at considerable length.The United States Delegation is prepared to favourably consider the acceptance,within a partial agreement, of the USSR proposal for a temporary cessation of nuclear tests, provided the USSR is prepared to favourably consider theacceptance of the United States proposal for the cessation of the manufacture offissionable material for nuclear weapons, both reached through detailed arrangements substantially as follows:  (a) The United States Delegation does not consider that it is possible to detectall nuclear tests without an appropriate inspection system. Further-more, the United States does not consider that intelligence monitoringmethods conducted by individual States is a satisfactory method ofcarrying out an international agreement. On the other hand, it is recognised that there are some disadvantages in waiting for the installation of an inspection system, after the conclusion of a partialdisarmament treaty before there is a cessation of testing.(b) Therefore, for this part of a partial agreement the United states delegation would be prepared to favourably consider the cessation ofall nuclear testing by all parties for an initial ten months&apos; period,commencing immediately upon the effective date of the partial: agreement, combined with the commitment of the parties to co-operate in the design and installation and maintenance of an inspection system; which would be capable when installed of reasonable certainty, ofdetecting nuclear tests and would be capable of maintaining an accurate measurement of radio-activity in the atmosphere, whether3   r     from nuclear&apos;testing Or from nuclear accidents or other nuclear events;v occurring after its installation.(c) The United States Delegation would be prepared to further grant, in they, partial; agreement, to the Board :of Control, the authority upon the installation of. such an inspection system to either order the continuedcessation of nuclear testing for a period beyond the ten months, or to
! order a limitation of the size of future nuclear tests, or to placelimitations upon the amount of radio-active material to be released intothe atmosphere in future tests. If it is a limitation that is ordered, then to establish a method of advance notification of such limited tests and establish reciprocal limited access to them.14. As indicated above, inseparable from the willingness of the United states delegation to consider favourably such an arrangement is the requirement that theSoviet Delegation consider favourably the cessation of manufacture of nuclear weapons through the installation and operation of an effective inspection system under which a &quot; cut-off&quot; would be effected beyond which all such fissionablematerials would go exclusively for non-weapons purposes, national orinternational, under international supervision. It is the impression of the UnitedStates Delegation, in view of the fact that the Soviet included the cessation of manufacture in the second stage of its March 18, 1957, proposal, which was tobe carried out in 1959, and from the lack of response of the Soviet to the earlierUnited States proposal for cessation of manufacture in which the date of March 1,1958, for installation of the inspection system was used, that the Soviet is not willing to establish a &quot; cut-off &quot; during 1958. In an endeavour to meet the Sovietposition in this regard, the United States is therefore willing to defer such a&quot; cut-off &quot; date and to establish March 1, 1959, for the installation of the inspectionsystem and one month later or as soon thereafter as possible under the effectiveinspection for the &quot; cut-off &quot; date.15. With respect to the inspection system, the United States Delegationfurther comments to the Soviet Delegation that it does not contemplate aninspection system so onerous as amounts to the management control of the entireatomic economies of our respective countries. It is the United States Delegation^view that a comparatively simple inspection system installed at the locations wherefissionable materials are produced and used and at the stockpiles of such fissionablematerials subsequently produced, can provide a sufficient degree of accuracy inaccounting as to be adequately reliable. Such an inspection system would be compatible with both of the economic and social systems of our two countries.Obviously, the precise inspection arrangement requires the work of technical experts, and necessitates agreement on the resulting design.16. Subsequent to the fulfilment of the &quot; cut-off &quot; date of future production,the United States Delegation is willing that the United States and the USSRtransfer to non-weapons purposes under international inspection any fissionablematerial previously produced and not already contained within nuclear weaponsor not previously transferred to non-weapons purposes. On its part the UnitedStates Delegation does not anticipate the United States having any appreciableamount of such unused fissionable material on such a &quot; cut-off &quot; date, but addsthis factor to its previous proposal as a suggested clarifying clause.17. Also subsequent to the implementation of such a &quot; cut-off &quot; date, theUnited States proposes that those States having nuclear weapons should commenceagreed, equitable, proportionate transfers of fissionable materials from weapons in successive increments over to internationally-inspected and supervisednon-weapons purposes including stockpiles either national or international.18. The United States is aware that in the Supreme Soviet in February 1955it was stated that the Soviet Union was abreast of if not ahead of the United states in the production of hydrogen weapons. The United States also estimates thatthe Soviet Union has expanded its production of fissionable materials since february 1955 and further-estimates that the United&apos;.States has.devoted morefissionable materials to non-weapons purposes since February 1955 than has theSoviet Union. &apos; -        - &apos; - :-19. It is also well known that the-United Kingdom had not had anopportunity to carry out the production of fissionable materials, for weaponspurposes at as early a date as the USSR and the United States. -20: The United States does not have precise information of the quantity offissionable materials which the Soviet Union now has devoted to weapons purposes.Neither does the United States have precise information: Of the amount of
fissionable material which the Soviet Union will produce between now and April 1,1959. Since the United Kingdom is associated with the United States in a collective security agreement an argument could be made that the transfers fromweapons purposes to non-weapons purposes under all these circumstances shouldbe made in increments which will equal on the one hand one-half by the soviet union and on the other hand one-half by the United Kingdom and United Statescombined.21. In the interest of negotiating a partial agreement, however, and ofending the nuclear arms race, the United States is willing that the United Kingdomincrement in such a programme of successive transfers shall be separatelyconsidered and shall in effect reduce the amount which both the Soviet union and the United States transfer to any total increment of transfer. Of the remainingquantity of an increment in addition to the amount transferred by the UnitedKingdom, the United States is willing to join 50 per cent, and 50 per cent, withthe Soviet Union.22. On the other hand, if it is the view of the Soviet Union that, becauseof the initiation by the United States of this specific proposal for transfers, theUnited States should carry more than half of this remaining percentage, the UnitedStates would be willing that the agreement provide that the amount to betransferred after the United Kingdom transfer is subtracted from the total shallbe transferred 47 per cent, by the USSR and 53 per cent, by the United States.Thus, for example, and not as a suggestion of total quantity, if 200 kg. offissionable material of a specified and comparable analysis is to be transferred in1960 from weapons purposes to non-weapons purposes, the Soviet Union wouldtransfer 94 kg. and the United States would transfer 106 kg.23. It is the further view of the United States Delegation that in connectionwith nuclear commitments and prohibitions, such as the foregoing, with theinclusion of provisions affecting prohibition of use, testing, cessation ofmanufacture, and transfers from weapons purposes, all signatories who had not previously produced nuclear weapons would as of the effective date of the treatyvoluntarily agree in consideration of the mutual benefits, they renounce themanufacture, possession, or acquisition of nuclear weapons. It would be made clear, however, that this renunciation would not prevent the training of the armed forces of such States in the use of nuclear weapons in precautionary measures forthe contingent possibility of a nuclear war nevertheless occurring. It would alsobe clear that the renunciation of possession by a State would not prohibit thepossibility of the possession of nuclear weapons on its soil by the armed forces ofa State which had previously manufactured such weapons if the location of suchweapons was not specifically completely prohibited within such zone.24. It would also be clear that the &quot; cut-off &quot; date of fissionable materials would not prohibit the right to refabricate nuclear weapons, since such right ofrefabrication may well be exercised to make such existing nuclear weaponsstockpiles into weapons which do not involve such large quantities of radio-activeparticles or weapons which might be designed for defence against aerial attackrather than for weapons designed for counter-attack, and for other reasons.25. The United States is willing to co-operate in the establishment of initialzones of aerial inspection and ground inspection in both a European-Russian zone and a United States-Canada-USSR zone, provided the other States concerned insuch zones consent, and provided the reciprocal and equitable character of thezones is reasonable and is precisely negotiated.26. Neither of the two zones in the Soviet April 30 paper is acceptable to theUnited States in the present form. In the United States-Alaska-USSR area theSoviet has proposed that the initial zone include only 32 per cent, of the territory of the Soviet Union and this is of the relatively less developed area in whichrelatively less military forces are located. On the other hand it is proposed that77 per cent, of the United States should be in the initial inspection zone, includingwithin that area the nuclear testing sites, a major atomic plant, many large air bases,numerous other important military installations, and a considerable number of keydefence industries. It would appear more equitable if the first step involvedrelatively the same number of square miles on both sides of the collective securityareas, but included within that similarity of square miles a similarity of percentage
of the territory of the USSR and the United States, and involved some comparablerelationship and significance on each side of the specific areas proposed. Thesematters can be taken up in detail in negotiating on a reasonable basis.27. In the European-Russian area the zone to be reasonable and acceptablemust be moved to the east and to the north. Here again details could be includedin detailed negotiations. The ground control posts would of necessity need to be considerably more extensive than the initial aerial and ground inspection sectorsand have appropriate radar and other facilities.28. The question of reduction in armed forces and armaments within anysuch initial zones will also involve the consent of the States concerned. It is atonce clear that a reduction as proposed to the extent of one-third of the forces ofthe United States stationed in the territory of Germany would be unacceptableand unreasonable in relationship to the first reduction to a 2\ million force level.The question of reducing the number of military air bases on both sides inconjunction with such first reduction to levels of 2\ million men may be examined with a recognition that if any such reduction of air bases in the territory of other states is included in a partial agreement it would be carried out with the consentof such other States.29. In an agreement all signators should specifically recognise the essentialrequirement of an effective inspection system to verify and guarantee in the caseof all States alike the fulfilment and observance of each commitment, and eachsignator should undertake to co-operate in the thorough reciprocal installation andmaintenance of such inspection.30. The Soviet Delegation is aware of the views of the United states delegation as to the importance of including an appropriate method for the controlof export and import of armaments within a partial agreement. This has beendiscussed in the Sub-Committee.31. The Soviet Delegation is also aware of the United States Delegation^views of the need to establish a system for advance notification of the internationalmovement of armed forces.32. The desirability of establishing an inspection system in the missile field and taking commitments in this regard, which we have previously discussed, is alsoreaffirmed.33. In general the suggested method of organisation of the regulation systempreviously presented by the United States Delegation with reference to Article 26of the United Nations Charter and within the framework of the Security councils reaffirmed, including an appropriate right of suspension. Many of these collateralmatters can be negotiated after the main points are agreed upon.34. The United States Delegation comments on the references to propaganda in the April 30th proposals that the United States is constantly endeavouring toimprove the prospects for a lasting and just peace, and that the successfulnegotiation of a mutual agreement for partial disarmament through sound andsafeguarded steps would be a concrete manner of lessening the dangers of war.35. The United States Delegation will be available for further informalexplanation of these views if the Soviet Delegation has questions. The UnitedStates Delegation anticipates at a later and appropriate time tabling formalproposals in the Sub-Committee and undertaking detailed formal negotiations.Such detailed negotiations in the view of the United States Delegation should takethe form, if progress is made, of the preparation of draft language for a treaty ofpartial agreement for the first steps of disarmament, which draft treaty, whenapproved by Governments, would then be ready for signing as a commitment of governments for ratification through respective constitutional processes.
UNITED STATES DELEGATION TO THE SUB-COMMITTEE OF THEUNITED NATIONS DISARMAMENT COMMISSIONLondon,June 8, 1957.USSR AIDE-MEMOIRE OF JUNE 7Attached is an unofficial translation of the Aide-Memoire handed to theChairman of the United States Delegation by the Chairman of the soviet delegation on June 8, 1957.E. M. PAULISCH,Delegation Secretariat.. On April 30, 1957, the Delegation of the USSR to the Sub-Committee of theUnited Nations Disarmament Commission tabled the proposal of the SovietGovernment concerning the implementation of partial measures in the field of disarmament. In these proposals it was pointed out that the Great Powers mustwithout delay take steps to ease the tension existing in international relations andto reduce the danger arising in connection with the existence of large armed forces and armaments in the possession of States and with the continuing armaments race,especially in the field of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and it was suggested tothe States represented in the Sub-Committee of the United Nations disarmament commission to come to an agreement regarding partial measures in the field of disarmament.The Delegation of the Soviet Union confirms the receipt from the delegation of the United States on May 31, 1957, of a memorandum which is an answer to thesaid proposals of the Soviet Government. The Delegation takes note of theUnited States Delegation^ statement contained in the memorandum to the effectthat it resumes negotiations with the Delegation of the Soviet Union on theproblems of disarmament.The considerations of the United States Government, as set forth in the saidmemorandum, have been carefully studied and the Delegation of the Soviet Unionhas been authorised to communicate the following:  1. Reduction in Armed forces the memorandum of the Soviet Government called attention to the proposal by the United States that for the present an agreement on conventional armamentsshould be limited to a reduction in armed forces to 2 - 5 million men for the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union and to 750,000 men each for the United Kingdom andFrance, and reduce armaments and military budgets by 10 per cent. Attention wasalso called to the fact that the United States had declined to carry out further substantial reduction in armed forces to the levels, proposed by itself, of 1 million-1 - 5 million men for the United States and the Soviet Union and 650,000 men forthe United Kingdom and France, or to take measures to prohibit atomic andhydrogen weapons.At the same time it was pointed out that during the last year and a half theSoviet Union had reduced its armed forces by 1,840,000 men whereas the levels ofthe armed forces of the Western Powers had remained practically unchanged during that period. It was also pointed out that the United States proposal to limitreduction in armed forces to 2 - 5 million men for the United States and the soviet union in the absence of an agreement on a comprehensive disarmamentprogramme, regardless of the unequal situation of the two States, gives an advantage to one side at the expense of the other. It cannot be ignored that theSoviet Union has a territory much larger than, for example, that of the UnitedStates, and lengthy frontiers, the protection of which requires a proportionatestrength of armed forces. Most particularly, it cannot be ignored that the securityof the Soviet Union is threatened in the West by the North Atlantic bloc, in thesouth by the Bagdad Pact grouping, and in Asia and the Far East both by the bagdad Pact grouping and the SEATO military bloc.The Soviet Union also pointed out the indisputable fact that the positionof the United States, whose territory is considerably smaller and whose frontiersare considerably shorter than those of the Soviet Union, is entirely different, andthat the frontiers of the United States are in no danger.
Thus, whereas a reduction in armed forces to 2- 5 million men would not onlyensure the security of the United States, but also enable it to maintain large armed forces outside its frontiers in foreign territories, the reduction in the armed forcesof the Soviet Union to that level would impair the security of the Soviet Union,whose frontiers, unlike those of the United States, are not protected by naturalobstacles and are also over a considerable length common with those of countriesparties to the aforesaid military groupings.The Soviet Government called the attention of the United States Governmentto the fact that the situation would change radically if the United States, the soviet union and China agreed to reduce their armed forces at the second stage to1 million-1-5 million men, and the United Kingdom and France to reduce theirsto 650,000 men; such a substantial reduction in the armed forces of these Powers,together with the prohibition of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, wouldmean that progress was being made toward effective disarmament and towardpeace.The Soviet Government, taking into account the aforesaid circumstances,called to the attention of the Government of the United States, that the UnitedStates, in proposing equal levels of 2 - 5 million men for. the armed forces of theSoviet Union and the United States, was not displaying a realistic approach tothe solution of the problem of reducing the armed forces of Powers, in particularthose of the Soviet Union and the United States, the more so since this measure was proposed without reference to any further reductions in armed forces or to any measures for the prohibition of atomic weapons.- The Soviet Union has been and still is for a radical solution of the disarmamentproblem that is, for reaching agreement on a substantial reduction in armed forces- and conventional armaments, on the prohibition of atomic and hydrogenweapons and their elimination from the arsenals of States, and also on theprohibition of tests of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Corresponding proposals by the Soviet Government, tabled in the Sub-Committee of the United NationsDisarmament Commission, remain in full force.The Soviet Government also recalled that it had accepted the proposal toreduce the armed forces of the United States, the Soviet Union and China to2-5 million men and of the United Kingdom and France to 750,000 men each, asa first step toward further reductions in the armed forces of the United States, theSoviet Union and China to 1-1 - 5 million men and of the United Kingdom andFrance to 650,000 men. It was understood in both cases that the strength of the armed forces was to include personnel employed in the armed forces as civiliansbut in fact serving military installations and equipment. The Government of theSoviet Union proposed that agreement should be reached to reduce the armed forces of the Four Powers to the aforesaid levels, these reductions to be carried outin two stages.It can be seen from the American memorandum that the United StatesGovernment has not displayed a positive attitude toward these proposals of theSoviet Government. In attempting to justify its refusal to accept the implementation of the measures provided for in the proposals of the Soviet Union, the Governmentof the United States refers to the allegedly defensive nature of NATO, SEATO andother military blocs to which the United States is party. The Soviet government cannot agree with this argument since it contradicts the real nature of the aforesaidmilitary groupings, the activities of which are directed toward preparation of,war against peace-loving States.One also cannot agree with the attempt to justify the necessity for the UnitedStates to have armed forces and armaments not less than those of the soviet union by asserting that the United States has vital interests and military commitments far beyond its territory, in remote areas of the globe. This argumentis unfounded if only because the presence of the armed forces of the United states in the said remote areas is in no way related to the safeguarding of the securityof the United States. This presence, as is well known, is a result of the policy of creating military blocs, carried out by the United States during the entire post-war period.Thus, both arguments mentioned in the American memorandum attest to thefact that the United States is striving to maintain at its disposal large armed forces which are by no means for the purpose of safeguarding the security of the UnitedStates proper.The Soviet Union is of the opinion that an equitable settlement of this problem could take place on the basis of the aforementioned proposals by the Soviet51788 c
Government of April 30. However, in endeavouring to co-operate in the achievement of an agreement on this question on a mutually acceptable basis, theSoviet Government could agree to reducing armed forces in three stages, to the levels proposed by the Government of the United States, namely:  For the United States and the Soviet Union to the level of 2 - 5 million menat the first stage, to the level of 2-1 million men at the second stage, and to thelevel of 1 - 7 million men at the third stage.As to the levels for the United Kingdom and France, the Soviet Union confirmsits proposal set forth in its memorandum of April 30. The Soviet Union, of course,has no objection to establishing the levels for the armed forces of the UnitedKingdom and France, corresponding to the three stages of reduction, uponnegotiation with the Governments of these countries.At the same time it is understood that the strength of armed forces of allPowers parties to the agreement must include personnel employed in the armed forces as civilians but in fact serving military installations and equipment. attention is called to the fact that in the American memorandum this point is not mentioned,although its importance is obvious.The Soviet Government deems it necessary that relevant agreements amongStates on the disarmament problem should relate to all the aforementioned three stages of reduction in armed forces and armaments. However, the memorandumof the United States Delegation states that the Parties concerned would execute the reduction in armed forces provided for the second and the third stages only ifcertain conditions are fulfilled. It is stated directly that an agreement on the second and third stages must be preceded by separate negotiations among the states concerned and that in the course of these negotiations the political and militarysituations existing at those times, as well as a number of other conditions, would betaken into account. Therefore, the legitimate question arises whether the intentis to limit the reduction in armed forces in fact only to the level of 2 - 5 million men for the Soviet Union and United States. The Soviet Government would appreciateit if the United States Government would clarify this point.2. Reduction in Armaments and Military ExpendituresThe Soviet Delegation notes that the United States has taken into account theproposal of the Soviet Union for an initial reduction in armaments by 15 per cent.The proposal of the United States to reduce armaments through a reciprocalsubmission of specific lists of armaments to be reduced meets with no objection inprinciple, although from the American proposal it is unclear how this is to becarried out. Therefore, it is expected that the United States, as well as the UnitedKingdom and France, will submit the proposed lists of armaments to be reduced,and after having studied them the Soviet Union will submit its own list.As to reductions in military expenditures, the Soviet Government continues tobe of the opinion that military expenditures could be reduced by 15 per cent, forthe first stage of reducing armed forces and armaments.At the same time it must be stipulated that the reaching of agreement onreducing armaments according to lists must not delay the implementation of theprovisions in the agreement pertaining to reductions in armed forces and militaryexpenditures.3. Prohibition of Nuclear WeaponsThe Soviet Government continues to be of the opinion that simultaneously with the conclusion of an agreement on reductions in armed forces, armaments, andmilitary budgets, agreement must be reached on the problem of atomic andhydrogen weapons, which in view of their tremendous destructive power representa particular danger. Accordingly, States should assume before the peoples of theworld a solemn obligation to renounce the use for military purposes of atomic andhydrogen weapons of all types, including air bombs, rockets with atomic andhydrogen warheads, irrespective of their range, atomic artillery, &amp;c. this obligation should enter into force as early as at the beginning of the first stage ofthe implementation of measures for reductions in armed forces and conventionalarmaments. In the opinion of the Soviet Government such an obligation could have been assumed in the form of a declaration, as was proposed by the soviet union in its memorandum of April 30.
It goes without saying that States Parties to the agreement must assume theobligation to exert every possible effort to reach an agreement on the total prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons and their elimination from thearsenals of States, the cessation of their manufacture, and the destruction ofstockpiles of such weapons.It can be seen from the memorandum of the United States Delegation that theGovernment of the United States does not express its readiness to conclude anagreement on the renunciation of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. in place of the said obligation, which would meet the demands of the peoples for doing away with the threat of atomic war, the United States in fact proposes thelegalisation of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. This is the only possibleevaluation of its demand that the use of these weapons should be provided for:  (a) If it is necessary in the interest of individual or collective self-defence underArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter if an armed attack occurswhich includes the use of nuclear weapons, or(b) If such an armed attack is of such a nature that it cannot be repelledwithout the use of nuclear weapons in the decision of the State usingsuch weapons.The proposal contained in the American memorandum, if accepted, would open the possibility of a completely arbitrary use of atomic weapons, which would only serve the purpose of an aggressor. In fact, this proposal means that the aggressor would be his own judge; he would judge himself whether he was rightor wrong in using nuclear weapons. It goes without saying that the Soviet Unioncannot be a partner in such a deal, since the interests of the peoples are not served by the legalisation of nuclear weapons, to which the American proposal actuallyleads, but only by a complete and unconditional prohibition of these weapons and,as an important step in this direction, by the renunciation of their use by States.It is not possible to ignore the position taken by the United States on thequestion of stationing atomic and hydrogen weapons in the territories of other states. With regard to this the proposals of the Soviet Government of April 30stated that stationing of atomic units in foreign territories is a serious threat to peace and security of the peoples, since even the smallest careless move might leadto fatal consequences. In its memorandum the Government of the United Statesinsists on giving the State manufacturing nuclear weapons the right to station these weapons in the territories of other States. It is obvious that such a position on thepart of the United States cannot further the settlement of this problem.One also cannot agree with the assertion, formulated in the Americanmemorandum, that the proposal contained in paragraph (a) is equivalent to theproposal of the Soviet Union that respective States should assume the obligationnot to be the first to use nuclear weapons. The Soviet proposal provides for theinadmissibility of the use of nuclear weapons, while the American proposal allowsthe use of such weapons.It can hardly be denied that these two proposals are of an entirely opposednature.The American memorandum expresses the desire that appropriate states should reach an agreement on the cessation of the manufacture of fissionablematerials for military purposes. However, the same memorandum states that theUnited States cannot agree to the prohibition of nuclear weapons, becauseallegedly they need these weapons for defence purposes. Thus, in fact, thelegalisation of the use of nuclear weapons is proposed. It is clear that such aprovision nullifies the significance of the proposal for the cessation of themanufacture of nuclear weapons, to which the Soviet Government has alreadycalled the attention of the Government of the United States.It can be seen from all this that on the question of the prohibition of nuclear weapons the position of the United States has been and still remains an obstaclefor reaching an appropriate international agreement, which would, serve thepurpose of stopping the armaments race and of doing away with the threat of atomic war. The Soviet Government would like to express its hope that theGovernment of the United States will take a more realistic position on this important problem.4. Cessation of Atomic and Hydrogen Weapons TestsThe Soviet Government adheres to the opinion that it is advisable to separate the problem of the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapons tests from the51788 &quot; d
totality of disarmament problems and to solve it without delay. The necessityof this is dictated both by the danger to human health which is connected withthe continuance of testing such weapons and by the fact that reaching an agreement on the cessation of tests would means a step forward in the direction of reaching an agreement on the total prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, not to speak of the fact that it would exert a positive influence on the entire international situation and that it would further the easing of international tension.The statement contained in the memorandum of the American Delegationconcerning the readiness of the United States to &quot; consider the cessation of allnuclear testing by all parties for an initial ten months&apos; period &quot; in no way promotesthe solution of the question of the prohibition of nuclear weapons tests. First,an agreement on this question is made contingent upon an agreement on the cessation of the manufacture of fissionable materials for military purposes, eventhough, as stated above, it is precisely the position of the United States thatobstructs such an agreement. Secondly, the proposal for the said ten months&apos; periodproduces absolutely nothing, since it is very well known that preparations for conducting a nuclear weapons test require a longer period of time. This means that, in fact, the ten months&apos; period would actually be used for the preparation of subsequent tests.In the opinion of the Soviet Government a period of at least two or threeyears should be provided for the temporary cessation of atomic and hydrogenweapons tests if a basis for an agreement, at the beginning at least on the suspension of tests for a fixed period of time, is to be sought seriously.Taking into account the desire, contained in the American memorandum, for international control over the observance of an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons tests, the Soviet Government expresses its readiness to establishsuch control. This purpose would be served by establishing, on a basis of reciprocity, control posts in the territories of the Soviet Union, the United States,the United Kingdom, and in the area of the Pacific Ocean to observe the fulfilmentby States of commitments relating to the cessation of atomic and hydrogenweapons tests.The Soviet Government cannot but express its regret that both on the questionof the prohibition of nuclear and hydrogen weapons and on the question of the cessation of testing such weapons the position of the United States, as expressedin the American memorandum, not only fails to further the stopping of the nucleararmaments race or the achievement of a corresponding agreement, but on thecontrary makes the achievement of these aims more difficult. The SovietGovernment would like to express its hope that the Government of the UnitedStates will reconsider its position and will, on its part, contribute to the necessaryagreement on these important questions, in the solution of which all the peoplesare vitally interested.5. International control as already stated in the memorandum of the Soviet Government of April 30,the execution of measures for reducing armed forces, armaments, military budgets,as well as for the prohibition of nuclear weapons must be subject to an appropriate international control.As already proposed by the Soviet Government, the control functions couldbe performed, as agreed by the Parties, by a control organ established for thepurpose within the framework of the Security Council.The Soviet Government confirms its proposal that as early as during the first stage control posts be established in the territories of States, on a basis of reciprocity, at large ports, at railway junctions, and on major motor highways, toensure that there is no dangerous concentration of armed forces and armaments.The list of the points at which control posts are to be established will be settled by later agreement. However, since we are now concerned with the implementation of partial measures only, the problem of control posts should be solved accordingly. During the first stage, control posts should be establishedonly in the western border regions of the Soviet Union, in the territories of France,the United Kingdom, and other signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty and the warsaw Treaty, and in the eastern part of the United States.Control posts may also be established, by agreement with other States, in territories belonging to them and lying within the aerial photography zone.&apos;.&apos; The establishment of control posts at airfields is proposed during the second and third stages of reductions in armed forces, armaments, and military budgets.
The establishment of control posts at airfields must, of course, also be related toan agreement on appropriate measures for the complete prohibition of atomic andhydrogen weapons and their elimination from the arsenals of States.The Soviet Government expresses its regret that the American memorandum,in fact, does not state the attitude of the Government of the United States to theproposal of the Soviet Government concerning control posts. The desire expressedin the memorandum that &quot; the ground control posts should of necessity be considerably more extensive than the initial aerial and ground inspection sectors &quot;is unclear, since no similar limitation is contained in the Soviet proposals. It ishoped that the Government of the United States, considering the importance ofthis question, will clarify its position.6.   Military Bases in Foreign territories the Soviet Government takes note of the statement contained in thememorandum of the United States Delegation concerning its readiness to consider,in connection with an agreement for partial disarmament measures, the questionof reducing the number of military air bases in the territories of other States. Itwould be desirable if the United States Government would introduce a moreconcrete proposal on this problem, taking into account the fact that an appropriateagreement on bases should be reached simultaneously with agreement on otherdisarmament measures. In particular, clarification is needed as to which of thesebases can be abolished as early as during the first stage of the implementation of disarmament measures.7.   Reduction in Armed Forces of the Four Powers in the Territories of CountriesParties to NA TO and the Warsaw Treaty and in the Territory of germany the Soviet Government expresses its regret that in the American memorandumno reference is made to the question raised in the USSR proposals of April 30concerning the reduction in armed forces of the United States, the United Kingdom,and France, stationed in the territories of countries Parties to NATO, and of armed forces of the USSR, stationed in the territories of countries Parties to the warsaw pact. This is an evidence of the fact that the Government of the United States is apparently against the said measure, even though its implementation would be ofgreat importance for the creation of a healthier atmosphere in Europe and for theeasing of international tension. The Soviet Government would like to receiveappropriate clarification from the United States Government concerning its position on this question.As to the question of reducing the armed forces of the Four Powers stationed in the territory of Germany by one-third the Government of the United Stateslimits itself to stating that the implementation of such a measure &quot; would be unacceptable and unreasonable in relationship to the first reduction to a 2-5 million force level.&quot; The Soviet Government cannot share this point of view,considering the importance of this question and the fact that a reduction in armed forces of the Four Powers stationed in the territory of Germany would also be ofgreat importance both for improving the situation in Europe and for settling theGerman problem. At the same time the Soviet Government would like to knowwhether the statement contained in the memorandum means that the Governmentof the United States is prepared to agree to the implementation of such a measuresimultaneously with implementation of measures for reducing armed forces and armaments at the second stage.8.   Zones of Aerial PhotographyIn its memorandum of April 30th, the Soviet Government introduced aproposal concerning the establishment of a zone of aerial photography in Europe,and of a zone of aerial photography in the Far East (eastern USSR-Alaska-UnitedStates). In introducing these proposals the desires of the United StatesGovernment, which so far has stressed the great importance of the question of aerial photography, were taken into account. As is well known, the SovietGovernment has stated more than once that aerial photography can neither prevent a surprise attack nor ensure the necessary controls over disarmament. However,taking into account that the question of aerial photography has become one of themost serious obstacles for disarmament, the Soviet Government has expressed itsreadiness to consider the question of establishing appropriate zones of aerialphotography.
The American memorandum expresses a negative attitude both to establishing a zone of aerial photography in Europe as well as in the eastern USSR-Alaska-United States area. The Government of the United States merely states that theEuropean zone is unacceptable to it because of the unacceptability of the boundariesproposed for this zone, and that the other zone was unacceptable to it because ofthe unequal economic importance of the areas suggested for aerial photographyover the territories of the USSR and United States. The reference to the economicinequality of the areas for aerial photography is not convincing, because the suggested areas are the most dangerous areas for concentration of troops, TheSoviet Government, in confirming its point of view, considers that a solution shouldbe sought not in rejecting or narrowing aerial control, but rather in its expansion.9. The Soviet Government ascertains the fact that the American memo-randum makes no reference to the Soviet proposal concerning the question ofthe cessation of propaganda for war and, in particular, to the proposed draft declaration &quot; On measures for strengthening universal peace and the securityof the peoples.&quot; However, we consider that the acceptance by States of such aDeclaration would serve the interests of all the peoples, taking into account thefact that in some countries propaganda for war, kindling of animosity and hatredamong peoples not only fails to decrease, but, on the contrary, increases. TheSoviet Government has proceeded and still proceeds from the premise that any state in the territory of which appeals for war, and especially for nuclear war, aretolerated bears a heavy responsibility before the peoples.The Soviet Government would like to express its hope that its proposals, asset forth in this memorandum which has been prepared with due account beingtaken of the important considerations contained in the American memorandum,will be duly considered by the Government of the United States and that it will,on its part, contribute to a further narrowing of the gap between the positions of the States participating in the disarmament negotiations.
