Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1957CONFIDENTIALCopy No.C. (57) 1189th May, 1957.cabinet home GUARDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for WarI have been considering the future of the Home Guard and have come to theconclusion that we should not be justified in spending any more money on it.2. The Home Guard, which came into being on 28th April, 1952, wascomposed of battalions with an establishment of 900 raised east of the lineFlamborough Head-Selsey Bill and cadre battalions of 50 which were raised west of that line. The initial recruiting maximum was 170,500.3. In October 1952, partly due to poor recruiting and partly to representationsthat cadre battalions of 50 would be incapable of rapid expansion in an emergency,the establishments were changed to 300 east of the line and 100 west of the line.The recruiting maximum then became 90,500.4. At the end of 1955, when the Home Guard consisted of 36,000 enrolledmembers and 42,000 on the Reserve Roll, it was decided that it would be capableof carrying out its commitments if placed on a Reserve basis and that the annual expenditure of  1 \ millions was not justified.5.   It now consists of:  No member of the Home Guard receives pay or bounty and the force dependsfor its existence on the volunteer spirit. Although it may be possible to maintainfor a while an active cadre for planning purposes, it will become progressively more difficult to replace wastage on the Reserve Roll. Many members of the active cadre feel that the task of reducing wastage has been made almost impossibleby the inadequate financial provision and if the Home Guard is to be kept aliveI am satisfied that it is necessary to spend approximately  100,000 during thecurrent financial year and thereafter an annual figure of about  50,000. In existingcircumstances this would not, I consider, be justified.6. I am advised that, having regard to the mandatory wording of Section 1(1)of the Home Guard Act, 1951 (&quot; There shall be established a force to be called theHome Guard .... &quot;), it is not possible to disband it formally without further legislation. As the Army Council are of the opinion that the Home Guard may stillbe of great value in global war and this view has been endorsed in Parliament on various occasions, I consider that, although on grounds of economy we shoulddisband the Home Guard in peacetime, we should amend the Home Guard Act inorder to make the existence of a Home Guard permissive and not obligatory as atpresent.7. I do not feel that I should be justified in asking for a special Bill at thepresent time, but this need not deter us from announcing our intentions. my proposal, therefore, is to make an announcement that the cost of the Home Guard,(a) Active cadre of sector commanders   ...battalion commanders      ......two other members per battalion ...(b) Reserve Roll.........5641,0801,79459,08151599
even on its present reserve basis, is no longer a justifiable expense on Army funds and therefore its remaining activities must cease. This could only be a temporary expedient, and it would be necessary to add that the first opportunity will betaken of introducing an amendment to the Home Guard Act which would enablethe force to be formally disbanded while retaining the power to raise it again if need arises.  The Minister of Defence agrees with the proposal.8.   May I have approval:  (a) to bring to an end the remaining activities of the Home Guard; and(b) to inform the House accordingly in my Estimates speech and add that thefirst opportunity will be taken to amend the Home Guard Act to enablethe force to be formally disbanded and to retain the power to raise it again if need arises.J. H.War Office, S.W.1.8th May, 1957.
