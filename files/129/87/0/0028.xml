THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. May 1957Copy No. 56CABINETHOME GUARDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for war on 14th . May the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with the attorney-General, to consider whether the Home Guard might be allowed graduallyto lapse without legislation and the Cabinet agreed to consider further in the lightof the result of this consultation (C.C. (57) 40th Conclusions, Item 2).2. I have now consulted the Attorney-General and I attach a copy of his letter on the subject.3. I am anxious to announce in the near future that the remaining activitiesof the Home Guard must cease at the end of July-this will enable them toparticipate in the National Rifle Association Meeting at Bisley in July. On theother hand, we must be in a position again to raise a Home Guard in the event ofan emergency. As I Understand the Attorney-General&apos;s letter, it will not bepossible, without further legislation, to revive the Home Guard after disbandment.On the other hand, in the Attorney-GeneraFs view, the question whether theHome Guard can be disbanded without legislation is more a question of constitutional propriety than of law, and we cannot solve the question of proprietyby retaining a small Headquarters.4. If I were simply to announce to the House that the Home Guard will be disbanded, as the Attorney-General suggests, I doubt if I should be able to meetcriticisms, based not on law but on constitutional propriety, that I was undoing byexecutive action what had been done by statute.5. I therefore suggest that I should announce to the House that Home Guardactivities will cease on 31st July next; and that legislation will be introduced, atthe earliest suitable opportunity, to disband the Home Guard and to authorise there-raising of a Home Guard at a later date.6. One opportunity for this legislation would be the next Bill which dealswith the Reserve Forces; such a Bill is likely to be needed during next session.Otherwise a separate Bill will be needed.J.

Royal Courts of Justice,London.23rd May, 1957.Thank you for your letter of 15th May. If Section 1(1) of the Home GuardAct 1951 stood alone, I would say that it had been complied with and that therewas no necessity for any further legislation.One cannot, however, ignore Section l(3)(a) and (b). It may be argued thatit is implicit from those sections that the Home Guard should be maintained during the period of a person&apos;s enrolment or re-engagement.The Statute does not impose any duty on anyone to establish or maintainthe Home Guard and I cannot see that any legal proceedings could be institutedwith any prospect of success if without further legislation the Home Guard wasdisbanded.Whether such legislation should be introduced seems to me more a questionof constitutional propriety than of law.Whether the retention of a small Headquarters would constitute a &quot; force &quot;within Section 1(1) is a question of fact not law. My personal view is that itwould not.If it is wrong to disband the force without further legislation, it is also wrong to seek to secure that result by covert methods such as refusing to accept volunteersor re-engagements.I would recommend that the Secretary of State announces to the House thatthe Home Guard will be disbanded and then, if any question is raised in the Houseas to the legality of his doing so, say that the Home Guard Act contains no expressobligation to maintain the Home Guard. If, having disbanded, the Secretary ofState desires to take power to raise a Home Guard at any time, legislationamending the 1951 Act is clearly necessary.Yours sincerely,(Signed)R. E. MANNINGHAM-BULLER.
