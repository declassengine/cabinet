THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 1168th May, 1957CABINETDEVELOPMENT AREASMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland in C. (57) 112 the President of the Board of Trade proposes that theGovernment should announce its intention to de-schedule certain areas, including(i) South Lanarkshire and (ii) North Ayrshire.2. Having expressed doubts as to the political wisdom of de-scheduling anyareas at this time I have with some reluctance agreed to the de-scheduling ofSouth Lanarkshire. For the following reasons however I am unable to agreeto the proposed de-scheduling of North Ayrshire.(a) The present percentage of unemployment in North Ayrshire is 2-5, andthere is the prospect of further unemployment due to the impendingclosure of the Royal Ordnance Factory at Irvine.(b) North Ayrshire is one of the natural areas to receive the overspill of population from Glasgow.(c) Glasgow itself is a scheduled area with .16,000 unemployed. If the overspilloperation is to be successful, the whole area constituted by Glasgowand the receiving areas must be treated as a single economic unit; and means must be found of providing additional employment in the unitas a whole to absorb the surplus labour. It would be insufficient toretain development area powers in Glasgow alone, where the opportunities of further development are limited, and not in the restof the area, where the main opportunities for further development exist.3. The Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Bill which deals withoverspill arrangements is at present in Committee. After the passage of the Billthere will be many problems to be settled between the &quot; exporting&quot; and&quot; importing&quot; authorities. If, while we are asking the local authorities of north Ayrshire to prepare for the reception of a large part of Glasgow&apos;s overspill,we announce that we are debarring the area from any possibility of assistance under the Distribution of Industry Acts, we shall be accused, with some justice,of undoing with one hand what we are trying to do with the other.4. In the circumstances I would hope that my colleagues will agree to the omission of North Ayrshire from the President^ statement.J. S. M.Scottish Office, S.W.1,7 th May, 1957.51593
