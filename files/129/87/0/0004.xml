THE CHANNEL tunnel memorandum by the Minister of Transport and civil aviation at their meeting on 18th April the Economic Policy committee invited me to refer the question of the Channel Tunnel to the Cabinet(E.A.(57) 8th Meeting, Item 3).    In dis cussion of my memorandum onthe tunnel (E. A. (57) 39) it was the general view that preliminary con-si deration should be given to the project inter-departmentaily before any approach was made to the French Government.    So that the Govern-ment would not lose the initiative, it was desirable that they should announce that a study was feeing made of the matter prior to laterdiscussions between the two Governments.2.      Since the meeting of the Committee interest in the tunnel has developed rapidly.     The Director-General of the Suez Canal Company(which is looking for something in which to invest its potential assets)has announced in the Press that the Company has decided to participate in a comprehensive survey of the scheme.    The American company, towhich I referred in E.A.(57) 39, has been energetically negotiating inParis for the formation of an Anglo-French-American syndicate toundertake the initial economic and engineering survey, which theirconsulting engineers estimate will cost anything from a quarter to halfa million pounds.     On the American plan the French element in thesyndicate would comprise the French Channel Tunnel Company (who holda valid and exclusive concession from the French Government);  the FrenchRailways (in so far as they are substantial shareholders in the FrenchChannel Tunnel Company) and the French shareholding in the Suez canal company.    The British element would on their plan comprise theBritish Channel Tunnel Company, Ltd. and the British shareholding inthe Suez Canal Company.3.      The Government, although substantial shareholders in the suez canal Company, have not enough voting strength to influence policy, but our directors of the Company are making it clear that Her Majesty!sGovernment have not yet reached any view on the tunnel and that theywould not regard themselves as committed in any way to the ChannelTunnel by any decision taken by the Suez Canal Company to participate in a survey.4.       these developments, however, indicate that a survey may now beundertaken whether we decide to participate in it or not.     There is,therefore, every advantage in clarifying our position as soon as possible and in expressing willingness to talk to the French Government before they themselves ask to have conversations with us.COPY NO.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.

5.      In particular the Government needs to ascertain whether theprima facie case for the tunnel is strong enough to make it desirable for Governments to be associated with a survey.    It is clear that nofirm view on the project can be reached until a detailed engineering andeconomic survey has been undertaken;  but the preliminary considera-tion already given to the matter by officials of the Treasury, ForeignOffice, Board of Trade and my Ministry, in accordance with the decisionof the Economic Policy Committee, confirms that it should be possibleto get a quick reappraisal of the potential value of a Channel Tunnel tothis country after informal consultations with certain of the principalinterests such as the Federation of British Industries and the british transport Commission.6.      I propose that these consultations should be put in hand as soonas I have announced the Governmenfs attitude and that I should do thisby the following inspired Parliamentary Question and Answer onWednesday, 8th May:-Ouestion:To ask the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation,whether he can now state the Governmenfs views on theChannel Tunnel.Answer:The Government is now examining the position to see whether it would be useful to have an exchange of viewson it with the French Government.H.W.Ministry of Transport and CivilAviation, W. 1.29th April, 1957.
