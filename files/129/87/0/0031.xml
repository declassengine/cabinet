Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1957SECRETCopy  No.C. (57) 13130th May, 1957CABINETSTERLING AND COMMONWEALTH ECONOMIC development memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee have during recent weeks been giving muchthought to the extent to which we can afford to assist economic development in theCommonwealth, in the light of the present insecure position of sterling and the severe limitations on our resources for both internal and external investment.2. The unquestionable and dominant fact in the post-war position of sterlinghas been that the proportion of the gold and dollar reserves to the UnitedKingdonrs sterling liabilities (to countries both inside and outside the sterling area) has been totally inadequate.3. It has been a major objective of post-war policies to improve this position.The fact is that, despite massive borrowing (the American and Canadian loans of 1,300 millions which we are now in course of repaying; Economic payments union where our accumulated debt is  120 millions; and more recently theInternational Monetary Fund (I.M.F.) drawing of  200 millions which we haveto repay in 3-5 years) and massive grant aid (we have received grants of  1,100millions under Marshall and subsequent economic and military aid programmes),the reserves to-day at  830 millions are in relation to trade as low as at any pointsince the war, whilst the liabilities at  4,100 millions are not much below theirpost-war peak.4. This has not been because we have failed to balance our trading account;apart from the two wholly exceptional post-war years of 1946 and 1947, we have earned a surplus on our trading account in every year except 1951 and 1955. Inthe nine years 1948-56, the average surplus has been  80 millions a year; over thefour years 1953-56  140 millions a year.5. Although this is creditable in itself, it is quite inadequate to meet even the external investment which we have done, much less to build up our reserves or toreduce our liabilities. Over the four years 1953-56, when our net current surpluswas  140 millions a year, our net long-term investment (outward and inward) was 200 millions a year. Our external net long-term investment is very large; lastyear the net figures were The R.S.A. investment alone is equivalent to about 1 per cent, of our gross national Product a higher percentage than any other country in the world and certainly higher than our pre-war figure.6. It is these considerations which led me, even before the recent borrowingof  200 millions from the I.M.F., to suggest that the United Kingdom needs a surplus on current account, year in year out, of some  300- 350 millions a year more in good years to balance less in bad years. Last year a year of excellentworld trading conditions and, on current account, little affected by Suez we hada surplus of  230 millions. This year, when world conditions again look good,present indications are that we shall not have even that surplus.Total  .......      .........Rest of the Sterling Area (R.S.A.) 190 millions 150 millions51713
7. The I.M.F. borrowing, the rising tide of our own investment abroad,especially in oil, and the increasing use (largely outside our control) of sterling balances for development must lead to the view that we need surpluses larger than 350 millions in the years immediately ahead. For the plain fact is this; we mustearn a surplus not only on our current account, but also on our current and long-term capital (or investment account) combined. Unless we do this we have nothingleft over to improve our reserve-liability ratio, i.e., our banking position. Anduntil we do improve this, not only sterling, the sterling area and the sterling system,but also all our policies social, political and military at home and abroad willbe insecurely based, and our currency will be open to dangers-e.g., withdrawal of sterling balances, which we have neither the power to control nor the resources to meet.8. Nothing can take the place of an adequate surplus on current account.But we shall be faced in the coming years with a drawing down of sterling balances,particularly in certain parts of the sterling area. This may be particularly heavyin the next few years. It would therefore be reasonable to seek to spread the burdenover a longer period of time by borrowing on long term in order to meet thesesterling drawings.9. Increasing investment at home, e.g., for steel, tankers, atomic power stations, &amp;c, is a charge on the same savings and resources which have to providefor external investment. Investment at home is probably even more vital to our future than investment abroad.10. In the light of these factors, it is clear that so far as practicable we oughtto find means whereby we could lend less and borrow more, in order to bring our external capital account more nearly into line with our resources. Studies havebeen made of the possibilities in both directions. The possibilities are, however,distinctly limited. The conclusions reached as regards outward investment are,broadly speaking:  (a) We could hardly retract, and certainly not in public, our existing policyof making special efforts in favour of investment in the Commonwealth,although it would be possible to adopt without publicity severerpolicies of scrutiny and stricter criteria for Commonwealth borrowing,both public and private; our attitude should be specially strict in dealingwith borrowers who hold substantial sterling balances in forms in whichthey can be used for the purpose of local development.(b) A general stiffening in our attitude to outward investment would probablyproduce some small savings; but significant reductions in outwardinvestment would require a change in policy which could be expectedto have serious political consequences in the Commonwealth, and undesirable economic consequences also.(c) Higher long-term interest rates which have recently prevailed have checkedoutward investment from the United Kingdom and the maintenanceof high long-term rates is the most effective check for the future.(d) We should consider very carefully before entering upon any new or increased commitments for Oversea lending.11. As regards inward investment, there may be some small scope for additional Commonwealth borrowing outside the sterling area, although this is unlikely to be substantial. There may be rather better prospects for additionalborrowing from foreign countries by the United Kingdom on private account,particularly by the oil industry. Further consideration is also to be given to aproposal whereby the Central Electricity Authority might borrow from theInternational Bank, for the nuclear energy programme. It is, however, quite clearthat we have come to the limit of what the United Kingdom Government canborrow from abroad, and the mere attempt to borrow more on government account might have damaging consequences for confidence in sterling.12. It is against this background that the Economic Policy Committee have considered our policy towards Commonwealth economic development generally,and in particular the two reports by the Committee On Commonwealth economic development (C. (57) 129) and the proposals by the Colonial Secretary regardingExchequer loans td the Colonies (C. (57) 130).
13. The Committee have concluded that, whilst we must continue to honourour existing commitments for Government-to-Government assistance, our policy towards economic development in the independent Commonwealth cannot for thefuture extend beyond the recommendations made in paragraph 17 (annexed) ofthe report concerning provision of capital by the Committee on commonwealth economic Development (C. (57) 129). We should in addition adopt the proposals in paragraph 9 (annexed) of the report on technical assistance by that Committee(C. (57) 129). To go beyond these recommendations and indicate our willingness to consider as a matter of general policy agreements with newly-independent commonwealth countries for Government-to-Government financial aid wouldmean that we should be subjected to heavy pressures for undertaking large additional commitments. It is, however, clear that the adoption of the course recommended by the Committee on Commonwealth Economic Development will need very careful presentation both internally in the United Kingdom and to theCommonwealth countries affected.14. The problem of loan finance for Colonial development is, however,somewhat different. Here we are already morally committed at least to supporting the completion of the plans for development during the current period (1955-60)of the Colonial territories for which we have a special responsibility. For thispurpose it had been estimated that Colonial Governments would be able if necessaryto raise an average Of  25 millions a year on the London Market. It is not yetcertain Whether or not Colonial Governments will succeed in raising  25 millions on the market during the current year they have in fact already raised 15 millions. Further examination is being made of this matter. If, however,it should prove that the full  25 millions will not be forthcoming, the economic policy Committee have accepted that consideration would then have to be givento the provision of capital finance for Colonial Governments from the Exchequer.It would also be for consideration at that point whether such loans from theExchequer would be financed from &quot; above&quot; or &quot;below the line&quot;; the formeralternative, involving Supplementary Estimates, might be preferable in order tobring home to all concerned that such Government loans involve a direct charge on our financial and physical resources. On the former basis, moreover, legislation might be avoided, provided that the loans were infrequent and arose out of specialcircumstances.15. The Economic Policy Committee agreed that, in view of the importanceof the issues involved, they should be further considered by the Cabinet.P. T.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,30th May, 1957.-   - ANNEX I paragraph 17 of the Report din Provision of CapitalWe make the following main recommendations (a) Ordinarily, capital for economic development should not be provided ona Government-to-Government basis to the independent Commonwealth.(b) From time to time special circumstances may well arise necessitatingGovernment-to-Government aid; its form should be decided in light ofsuch circumstances.(c) The   United   Kingdom   should,   where   appropriate,   stimulate   theestablishment and expansion of development and finance corporations in the newer independent countries of the Commonwealth, whetherthrough the Commonwealth Development Finance Company(C.D.F.C.) or through other companies with large local interests.(d) The C.D.F.C., for the purpose outlined in (c) above and generally, shouldbe informed of the importance Her Majesty&apos;s Government attach tothe expansion of their activities. The Treasury and the Bank ofEngland should consider what practical help can be given to theCompany to this end. . -;. -&apos;
(e) The Colonial Development Corporation should continue to assist colonial territories in the development of commercial projects but, if theproposals by the Colonial Secretary for Exchequer loans to colonial governments are approved, it should not make loans to governments or to Government-controlled corporations. It should not embark on new schemes for independent territories, but it should not be debarred from seconding individual members of its staff to assist in managingnew development projects in newly-independent countries, or fromacting on a management agency footing, if so requested by theGovernment of the country concerned.ANNEX IIParagraph 9 of the Report on Technical AssistanceOur recommendations are as follows (i) Generally we favour increasing the scope of the commonwealth economic Committee. In particular at this time we recommend the strengthening of its functions as a research institution for the study of economic problems of common Commonwealth interest. To thisend Her Majesty&apos;s Government should propose to the Governmentsof independent Commonwealth countries that the Committee&apos;s work should be extended to cover the collation and publication ofinformation about Commonwealth development and its financing(including the arrangements made by Commonwealth Governments for technical aid). This matter might be explored in the context of theCommonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting.(ii) Without prejudice to existing arrangements for the giving of technical assistance, Her Majesty&apos;s Government should aim to conclude an appropriate technical assistance agreement with each commonwealth government as it achieves independence.(iii) As part of the arrangements referred to in (ii) above, the Colonial OfficeAdvisory Services should be made available through the commonwealth relations Office to those independent Commonwealth countries whichdesire them.(iv) The Commonwealth Relations Office should consider how far theadministrative arrangements for the Colombo Plan technical co-operation Scheme can be improved.(v) The question of Departmental responsibility for the United Kingdomconcern with scientific research in the Commonwealth should be further examined.(vi) More publicity is needed for the facilities which the United Kingdom isable to offer to Commonwealth Governments in the field of appliednuclear science. The possibility of periodic Commonwealthconferences on co-operation in atomic development for peacefulpurposes might be discussed with the Commonwealth Prime Ministers.
