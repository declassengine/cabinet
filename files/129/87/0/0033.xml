Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1957The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. It is issued for the personal use of...............................................................TOP SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 1333rd June, 1957CABINETPUBLIC SERVICE salaries memorandum by the Prime minister have had under consideration revised proposals for public service salaries;I have discussed them with some of my colleagues, and I set them out in thefollowing paragraphs. It will probably be necessary to defer announcing any decision until after the Whitsun recess; but in view of the extensive speculationand rumour which has been given to our intentions, we should consider thepossibility of an earlier announcement; consultation with the Opposition mustof course precede any announcement.Peers&apos; Allowances2. We should keep to the plan for the direct reimbursement of expenses incurred by Peers in attending the House of Lords (duly attested by the Peerconcerned, but not &quot; vouched &quot; or accounted for in detail), subject to a maximumdaily allowance. This will be almost entirely a subsistence allowance, i.e., forhotels and meals; there are few other expenses resulting directly from attendance at the House of Lords. The maximum rate of subsistence at present paid in thePublic Service is  2 8s. 6d. We can go a little higher than this for Peers, and i recommend three guineas a day.Members of Parliament3. I propose that in place of the sessional allowance we should have anexpenses allowance of  750, which would be drawn in full by all Members ofParliament irrespective of their actual expenses. - (The basic salary would remain
at  1,000.) This would be considered as part of remuneration for taxationpurposes. But Members would be entitled to charge against it their Parliamentaryexpenses.4. The effect of this would be precisely the same as the substitution for thepresent salary and sessional allowance of a new inclusive salary of  1,750. Butit will help the public presentation of the plan if the additional  750 is specificallylinked with expenditure which is incurred in the discharge of Parliamentary duties.ministers. Any satisfactory plan for improving the remuneration of Ministers must provide for some increase in the basic salary. All Ministerial salaries of  5,000or less should be improved by  1,000 a year, with no change over  5,000 a year.6. In addition, all Ministers in the Commons should draw the newParliamentary expenses allowance of  750. In the case of Ministers with salaries of less than  5,000, this would replace the present entitlement to draw  500 of theParliamentary salary.7.   The effect of these two changes will be that:  (i) The total remuneration of Ministers in the Lords with salaries of  5,000or less will be improved by  1,000.(ii) The total remuneration of a Minister in the Commons and with a salary of  5,000 would be raised to  6,750.(hi) The total remuneration of Ministers in the Commons with a salary of lessthan  5,000 would be increased by  1,250.(iv) The total remuneration of Ministers in the Commons with salaries ofover  5,000 would be improved by  750.Other Changes8. We should take the opportunity of the necessary legislation for Ministers&apos;salaries to bring Ministers into the Injury Warrant scheme. We should also makeconsequential changes for the Leader of the Opposition and for the Officers ofthe Houses of Parliament, and announce the scheme which has been agreedinterdepartmentally for raising the salaries of members of the boards of the nationalised industries.   (Details are at Annex A.)Cost9. The annual cost of these proposals for Ministers, Members of parliament and Peers is roughly of the order of  400,000. The proposals for the boards ofthe nationalised industries will increase total expenditure on salaries by about 200,000; but this expenditure is not a charge on the Exchequer.Announcement10.   A draft statement is attached at Annex B.H. M.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,31st May, 1957.
ANNEX AInjury Warrant1. Legislation will be required to adjust the remuneration of Ministers. Theopportunity should be taken to include in the Bill a Clause applying the terms ofthe Injury Warrant to Ministers travelling on duty. (A Memorandum on thissubject (C (54) 198) was circulated to the Cabinet by the then Chancellor of theExchequer on 16th June, 1955.) It is absurd that Ministers should be the onlyservants of the Crown for whom (or for whose dependants) there is no provision in the event of their death or injury on duty.Officers of the House2. The adjustment of Ministerial salaries will involve some consequentialchanges for the Officers of the House.3. Mr. Speaker has at present a salary of  5,000; but  4,000 of this is free of tax. He ought to be consulted before, a decision is taken whether (havingregard especially to the high value in present conditions of this tax arrangement)his emoluments should be adjusted at all and if so, how. The best course mightbe to make no change at all; but if a change is desired, one possibility would beto improve his gross salary by  1,000 by analogy with the proposal for ministers on the same level of salary; an alternative would be to allow him to draw theParliamentary allowance of  750, though an allowance for Parliamentary expensesmight seem hardly appropriate in his case.4. The Chairman of Committees in the Lords and the Chairman of Ways and means in the Commons each receive salaries of  2,500, and the Deputy Chairmanin the Commons receives a salary of  1,500; in addition the two Officers of the commons are allowed  500 of their Parliamentary salary. It is suggested thatall three of them should receive exactly ihe same treatment as a Minister on thesame level of salary-namely, an increase of  1,000 in the basic salary, and in thecase of the two officers in the Commons the right to draw the full expensesallowance of  750 in place of the  500 of Parliamentary salary.5. The Leader of the Opposition receives a salary of  2,000 and  500 of his parliamentary salary. One possibility would be to treat this Office in the same way as that of Chairman of Committees; we should no doubt consult the presentLeader before we take our decision.Boards of the Nationalised Industries6. A plan for the improvement of the emoluments of members of the boards of the nationalised industries has been agreed between the Ministers concerned.It is based on the principle of raising the top rate of salary from its present levelof  8,500 to  10,000, with corresponding adjustments at other levels. (This was reported more fully to the Cabinet in C (57) 42.) It is proposed that the plan should be announced and brought into effect concurrently with the announcementsabout Ministers and Members of Parliament.
ANNEX draft statement i wish, to make a statement about the remuneration of Members of parliament and of the holders of certain other public appointments.2. The Government has for some time accepted that there is a strong case for increasing the remuneration of Members. We consider that the time has come when Members&apos; emoluments must be increased.3. The House will recall that the Select Committee appointed in 1953 foundthat, on the average, a Member of Parliament had to lay out no less than  750a year to meet the expenses arising out of the discharge of his duties a necessitywhich at that time left him with  250 only of his salary to devote to the maintenanceof himself and his dependants. The introduction of the sessional allowance was a partial remedy only, and left the total emoluments well below the figure thoughtright by the Select Committee four years ago.4. The Government has, therefore, decided to propose to the House thatthe sessional allowance should be abolished and should be replaced by an expenseallowance of  750. The basic Parliamentary salary would remain unchanged at its present level of  1,000. The new expenses allowance would be available to bedrawn in full by all Members though. Like the basic salary, it would be chargeable to income tax. But Members would continue to be entitled to relief from tax inrespect of their Parliamentary expenses within the total of the basic salary plus the expenses allowances, just as they are now within the total of the salary andthe sessional allowance.5. The House will be asked to move a resolution giving effect to these changesin the near future.6. The Government has also decided to adjust the emoluments of ministers at the same time. Apart from certain adjustments made by the Ministers of theCrown Act, 1937, and the Ministerial Salaries Act, 1946, these still stand at thegeneral levels fixed in the last century. They are, in fact, far more out of date thaneven the emoluments of Members.7. The Government proposes that all ministerial salaries of  5,000 or lessshould be improved by  1,000 a year; above  5,000 there will be no change in the basic salary. In addition all Ministers in this House, whatever their salary, will been abled to draw the new Parliamentary expenses allowance of  750. In the caseof Ministers with salaries of less than  5,000, this would replace the presententitlement to draw  500 of the Parliamentary salary. The Bill necessary to giveeffect to these changes will be introduced after Whitsuntide.8. Another matter which the Government proposes to deal with now isthe reimbursement of expenses incurred by noble Lords in order to attend in another place. The case for this was accepted by the then Lord President of theCouncil in debate on 7th November last.  It is no longer tolerable that we should
debar from public service in the other House all save those who can afford notonly to give that service without pay, but can meet out of their own pockets, theexpenses which are very often inseparable from it. The only assistance which members of the other House at present receive towards those expenses is free railtravel to Westminster. The Government now proposes to help them with their other expenses by allowing them to claim reimbursement up to a maximum ofthree guineas for each day of attendance. The allowance, being a reimbursement of specific expenses arising out of unpaid duties, will not attract tax; each nobleLord will be required to sign a declaration that he has incurred the expenses whichhe claims.9. This House will be asked to move a resolution authorising this newallowance.10. Finally, the Government has decided that the long-deferred adjustment of the salaries of members of the boards of the nationalised industries should now take place. A plan has been worked out of which I do not propose to give full details now. I will, however, give two figures to illustrate the order of the adjustments. The maximum salary of the Chairman of such a board will be raised from  8,500 to  10,000, while that of a member of a major board will be raised from  5,000 to  7,500. [In accordance with precedent and in some cases withstatutory requirements the changes will be reported to Parliament in detail indue course.]11. [The cost of the Governmenfs proposals for Members, Ministers andPeers is about  400,000 a year. The salaries of members of the boards of the nationalised industries are not a charge on the Exchequer^]30th May, 1957.*Note. [Not for inclusion in the Statement]Atomic Energy Authority salaries do, in fact, fall on the Exchequer. They are being improvedas part of these changes. But Atomic Energy is not a &quot; nationalised industry &quot; in the ordinary sense.
