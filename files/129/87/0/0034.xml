secret.(57) 134COPY NO.3rd June, 1957CABINETDOLLAR TRAVEL ALLOWANCE AND IMPORTSFROM THE DOLLAR area memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Cabinet will wish to be aware of two steps which thePresident of the Board of Trade and I are proposing to take in thedirection of dollar liberalisation -(a) I am sure that the time has now come to introduce a dollartravel allowance.   I am proposing, therefore, to extend the presenttravel allowance of  100 to include travel in the dollar area, notably inthe United States and Canada.   The cost cannot be estimated but it willbe small and will in my view be far outweighed by the direct and indirect benefits of this move.(b) The President proposes to introduce on the 1st July certainrelaxations in the import of industrial raw materials and some other commodities.   The broad effect will be that, with the exception of leather,all the remaining import restrictions on industrial raw materials and metal semi-manufactures as well as certain agricultural products will be abolished on 1st July.   It is estimated that the switch to dollar sources of supply which will result will add some  12- 13 millions to our dollarimport bill, but the addition to our total import bill is not expected to exceed  3 millions.2.      There will be some consequential cost in the correspondingrelaxation which will have to be allowed in the Colonies.   This may beabout  3. 3 millions in dollars.   There will be some switching away from united Kingdom exports but the net increase in the Colonies&apos; total importbill will be only about  1 million.   I must also expect that some of theindependent sterling area countries will make some relaxations, but i cannot put a figure on this.3.      I attach a draft of a statement which I propose to make in theHouse of Commons on Tuesday.P.T.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.1st June, 1957
Draft Statement by the Chancellor of the ExchequerWith your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House,I wish to make a statement on travel in the dollar area and import controls on industrial raw materials.2.     I have decided that the ordinary travel allowance, atpresent  100 a year, will be available in future for travel to the dollar area in the same manner as for travel in thetransferable account area.     For the present travel year, from november to October, the whole  100, or such balance as maynot have been spent already, can be used in the dollar area from now to the end of October.3.     The cost of this step cannot exactly be estimated, butI do not expect it to be substantial.h.      I also have to tell the House that my Rt. Hon. friend the President of the Board of Trade has decided to discontinue the import controls on a large number of commodities used in industry.     This will mainly affect imports from the dollar area.      The Board of Trade will announce the details shortly,but the broad effect will be that, except in the case ofleather for which the dollar quota will be substantially increased, all the remaining import restrictions on industrialraw materials and metal semi-manufactures and ou certainagricultural products, mainly used in manufacture, will be abolished on 1st July.     Some switching to dollar  * sources of supply is likely, but the net cost of additional imports asa result of these measures is not expected to exceed 3 million.     The control will also be removed from certainchemicals, but additional imports are not expected to result inthis case,/5.    These
5.     These steps, which lead towards the Government&apos;s primaryobjective of freer trade and payments on a world-wide basis,are taken because they will benefit the economy of thecouncry.      In particular,  tourist travel to the dollar area has been prohibited for the last ten years,  and this haserected an unnatural barrier between the English-speakingpeoples which should not bo allowed to continue any longer than is necessary.     The decisions do not mean that there hasbeen a change in the need to economise on external expendi-ture, but I am satisfied that in this case these moves are fully justified by the direct and indirect benefits toBritish- interests which they will bring with them.
