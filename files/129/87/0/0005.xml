(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(57) 10530th April, 1957EXPORT OF CATTLEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food the Home Affairs Committee on 11th February, 1957(H.A.(57) 3rd Meeting, Item 5) endorsed our decision to set up underthe Chairmanship of Lord Balfour of Burleigh a Committee of enquiry into the export trade in live cattle from Great Britain to the Continentfor slaughter.2.        The Committee have now reported and copies of the report are circulated herewith.3.        The Committee found some evidence of undue suffering in theexisting trade but concluded that, except to a very limited extent, thealternative of a carcase trade was not feasible.     While not going sofar .as to recommend stopping the existing trade entirely, they have recommended important restrictions.     The main recommendation(paragraph 17) is as follows:-&quot;The trade should be allowed only to smallcountries such as Holland or similar autonomousterritories, where internal transit afterdisembarkation can only be over short distancesand where the Government concerned can givesatisfactory assurances that the animals willnot be allowed to move out of their territory.The method of slaughter must satisfy british requirements, and conditions of lairage andslaughterhouse facilities must be satisfactory&quot;.4.        Although this restriction would involve some financial loss tothis country and might result in an increase in the export of cattle from ireland to the Continent (thus not diminishing the total amount ofsuffering although Irish cattle instead of ours would be involved) we feel that, in view of the great public anxiety that has been expressed Inthis country about the trade, we must a.accept this recommendation inprinciple.     Its precise wording, however, rules out France (at present one of the main importing countries).    It would be undesirable for theGovernment to take any action which would clearly and openlydiscriminate against France;  moreover, if the French could, in fact,meet the requirements regarding distance of transport and slaughterconditions it would be unreasonable to discriminate against them.COPY NO.  S cabinet
5.        We therefore propose that instead of restricting exports to&quot;small countries&quot; we should impose a condition that the cattle shouldtravel only a short distance from the-port of disembarkation beforeslaughter.    This would not in terms discriminate against France orany other country.6.        We suggest that the distance to be specified should be40 kilometres (about 25 miles).     We feel that this would be defensible,whereas any substantial distance would not satisfy the animal welfareinterests and would lead to strong pressure for more drastic restrict-ions.    Consequently the conditions under which the trade would beallowed to continue would be:-&quot;The export of cattle will be allowed only to countries the Governments of which have givenus an assurance that the animals will beslaughtered at slaughterhouses which are within40 kilometres of the port of disembarkation, whereslaughter methods satisfying British requirements are in operation and where the arrangements foraccommodating and handling the animals are satisfactory&quot;.7.        The trade in recent months has been confined to France (whichhas taken just under half the total), Holland and Western Germany(figures in Appendix l).    The effect of the above proposal would beto stop the export of cattle tc France, where slaughter methods donot at present satisfy British requirements.    The 40 kilometre limitmight also have some effect on the trade to Holland (since some cattleat present travel by road from Rotterdam to Amsterdam, a distancegreater than 40 kilometres),   but the bulk of the Dutch trade and thatwith Western Germany could continue. Thus the effect of our proposal would be to reduce the total trade by about one half.8.        The Agricultural Ministers have no statutory powers at present to impose these restrictions but the situation could be met for the timebeing by the use of the export licensing machinery of the Board of Tradeunder powers derived from the Import, Export and Customs Powers(Defence) Act, 1939.    We hope that the President of the Board of Tradeand our other colleagues will agree to this as an interim measure untilfresh legislation can be introduced.9.        We also propose to continue the veterinary inspection of allcattle being exported to the Continent for slaughter which has been inoperation since 26th February under administrative arrangements.This will ensure that no unfit animals are exported and we intend to make this a statutory requirement as recommended by the Committee(paragraph 24(a) ) by amending the Exported Cattle Protection order as soon as possible.10.      The Committee have also made a number of minorrecommendations to prevent unnecessary suffering to cattle intended for export to the Continent before they leave this country and while at sea.    Most of these seem reasonable and some can be implementedunder our existing powers while others would require fresh legislation.As these recommendations are, in the main, concerned with details,we consider it desirable to consult the interests concerned before reaching final conclusions.    We propose to do this as soon as possible.
11.       If our colleagues agree, we propose that the main recommendationrestricting exports should take effect from 1st June and the otheracceptable recommendations as soon as possible after the necessary-consultations have taken place.    We ask for authority to prepare aBill, for presentation next session, to give permanent statutory effectto the main recommendation and such of the other acceptablerecommendations as require fresh legislation.1Z.      Subject to the agreement of our colleagues it is proposed thata statement be made in both Houses on 7th May on the lines of appendix II.13.      There is no doubt that this is a highly controverial question;and the possibility cannot be excluded that Members on both sides ofthe House may press the Government to stop the trade completely,despite the Committee&apos;s recommendations.J.M.D.H.A.30th April, 1957.APPENDIX IExports of Cattle to the Continent of EuropeFebruary and March 1957February March TotalFrance                                     4,340 4,495 8,835Holland                                    3,701 3,464 7,165Western Germany                  1,584 1,667 3,2519,625 9,626       19,251
APPENDIX IIProposed Statement on the Report of the BalfourCommittee1.        My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotlandand I have very carefully considered the Report of the Balfour Committeeon the Export of Cattle to the Continent for slaughter.    We accept theCommittee&apos;s main recommendation that restrictions should be imposed on this traffic.    Acting in the spirit of the recommendation we intendfrom 1st June to allow such exports only to countries in respect ofwhich we are assured by the Givernments concerned that the animalswill be slaughtered at slaughterhouses which are within 40 kilometres(about 25 miles) of the port of disembarkation, where the slaughtermethods satisfy British requirements, and where the arrangementsfor accommodating and handling the cattle are satisfactory.     we propose to introduce the necessary legislation as soon as possible;  asa temporary measure, individual export licensing by the Board of trade will be reimposed on 1st June under powers derived from the Import,Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act, 1939.     Licences will begranted only for such exports for slaughter as satisfy the conditionsI have mentioned.2.        The Committee made a number of recommendations designedto increase the protection afforded to cattle before they leave thiscountry.     We shall continue the veterinary inspection of all cattlebeing exported for slaughter on the Continent, which has been inoperation since 26th February this year under the permissive powers conferred by the Exported Cattle Protection Order, 1957.    This will ensure that no unfit cattle are allowed to be exported, and we proposeto make this inspection a statutory requirement, as recommendedby the Committee.     We also propose to discuss as soon as possible with the interests concerned the recommendations relating to strengthening the conditions applicable to the rest period before export.3.        The Committee recommended one or two amendments to theregulations governing the carriage of animals by sea;   some rathertechnical points are involved and here again we propose to consult theinterests concerned as a matter of urgency.4. We are drawing to the attention of British Railways theCommittee&apos;s recommendations which concern them.5. Finally, the Committee made one or two general recommend-ations of a long term nature including the suggestion that thedisbudding of calves and the use of the electric goad, instead of thedrover &apos;s stick, should be encouraged.     W:c are in sympathy with these recommendations which we propose to bring to the notice of theinterests primarily concerned.6. vVe should like to thank sincerely Lord Balfour and his committee for the expeditious manner in which they carried out thetask which was entrusted to them at very short notice.

22AREPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY INTOTHE EXPORT OF LIVE CATTLE TO THE CONTINENTFOR SLAUGHTERTo the Rt. Hon. Derick Heathcoat Amory, M.P.,Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.The Rt. Hon. John S. Maclay, C.M.G., M.P.,Secretary of State for Scotland.Sirs,1. We were appointed on 6th February, 1957 to be a Committee, with thefollowing terms of reference :&quot; To enquire into the export trade in live cattle from Great Britain tothe Continent for slaughter, the considerations affecting the continuanceof this trade, and steps to avoid any unnecessary suffering of the cattle atall stages of their journey; to consider whether slaughter before exportwould be a desirable and feasible alternative; and to make recom-mendations.&quot;2: We have completed our enquiries and have the honour to submit our report.3. We have held nine meetings and have received evidence, oral or writtenor both, from the persons and organisations listed in Appendix H. We havealso received many letters expressing views on the subject of our enquiry, anda number of petitions advocating the cessation of the trade.4. Members of the Committee have visited Dundee, Leith, Hull, Felixstowe,Harwich, Lydd Airport, France, Holland and Western Germany. reports on these visits are at Appendices A to G.5. We find that the great public anxiety about this export trade derivesin the main from apprehension on four points : (i) export of animals unfit to stand the journey abroad ;(ii) lack of adequate care and attention before embarkation ;(hi) long train journeys without food or water after disembarkation onthe Continent;(iv) deprivation of the protection of the British slaughter of animalslegislation;6. We desire to say at once that there is justification for anxiety on allthese grounds. We feel bound to say also that we do not think that all those engaged in this trade have shown themselves to be fully alive to the degreeof suffering capable of being caused to animals during transport by landor sea.- -7. It is fair to add that much of the trouble in respect of point (ii) abovewas due to the sudden emergence of conditions which made ah export tradein live animals for slaughter profitable and the consequent improvisation ofarrangements at ports which were not adapted and equipped for that purpose.We are satisfied that conditions in that respect have been greatly improved by the introduction Of the Exported Cattle Protection Order, 1957 which came into operation on 26th February.8. We have recommendations to make which bear on all four points butfirst we must answer the specific question whether slaughter before export
would be a desirable and feasible alternative. Slaughter before export wouldbe desirable, but the overwhelming weight of evidence is that except to avery limited extent the alternative of a carcase trade is not feasible. Thisis because of the absence of sufficient demand in Continental markets forfrozen or chilled meat, and the difficulties attendant upon exporting meat toreach distant Continental markets as fresh meat. Efforts have already beenmade to establish a trade in frozen or chilled New Zealand or Argentine .meat on the Continent and these have met with a marked lack of success,despite the fact that this meat was offered at a lower price than the currentprice for fresh meat. Our witnesses with knowledge of the meat trade were unanimous in the opinion that the scope for the export of meat instead of cattle is extremely limited. Such enquiries as Members of the Committeewere able to make on the Continent confirm this view. We note, however,that there is a small trade in the export of carcases from Great Britain toFrance and we recommend that all possible encouragement and assistance should be given to this trade. Any expansion would require considerableorganisation and arrangement with meat inspectors of local authorities. Itwould create an immediate demand for suitable containers which do notappear to be readily available today. It would throw a considerable stressupon the present slaughterhouse facilities at suitable centres for such exporttrade. It would need considerable organisation of transport facilities cross-channel-which might not be readily available. Even then, there wouldbe difficulty in ensuring the fresh condition of the meat on arrival in distantContinental centres of population. The latter problem might be overcome by the use of interfrigo wagons of which, again, there do not appear to besufficient available at the present time for this traffic. We think the interests concerned would do well to study the possibility of utilising suitable animalsfor canning and other manufacturing purposes in this country.9. It has been suggested to us that the lack of veterinary supervision of meat inspection in England and Wales may add to the difficulties of exportingmeat to the Continent since most Continental countries require certificates of veterinary inspection ante- and post-mortem. We have noted that atSouthampton and some other places arrangements have been made for theprovision of veterinary certificates in respect of meat slaughtered for export to France, and we see no reason why similar arrangements should not bemade at other slaughterhouses.10. We were shocked to learn that contracts for the supply of meat for theUnited States Forces in Europe could not be arranged from this countrydirect because our slaughterhouses fall short of the standards demanded bythe American Army Veterinary Corps. The first shipment abroad of livecattle was in fact made in order to complete an American Army contract,the slaughterhouses in The Hague and Rotterdam having been approvedby the American authorities. During the operation of this contract, theDutch civilian trade became aware of the availability of high quality Britishcattle on their market, and, as a result, a considerable trade developed withHolland.&apos; French buyers then appeared on the Dutch market and boughtBritish cattle in Rotterdam. In due course, the French Government becameinterested in the importation of cattle, and encouraged this trade by waivingthe normal 30 per cent, ad valorem import duty. Later a strong demanddeveloped in France for cows of manufacturing quality said to be requiredlargely to provide meat to fill a series of fresh and canned meat contracts forthe French Army, and the trade developed on the scale described in para-graph 18 below.11. We come now to the question whether the suffering caused to animalsby the journey by sea or air to the Continent is sufficient in itself to justify
the total prohibition of the trade. This question we must answer unhesitatinglyin the negative for the reason that subject to strict observance of all theregulations under the Animals (Sea Transport) Orders, the Transit of AnimalsOrders, and the Exported Cattle Protection Order, transport by sea or air tothe Continent involves no greater suffering to the animals concerned thandoes properly conducted inland transport. The journey from the embarkationpoint to the Continent may often be shorter than some inland journeys. Wehave, however, a number of recommendations to put forward with a view to strengthening the protection provided for animals by these various regulations.These are set out in paragraphs 24 to 36 of our report.12. Our attention was directed in written evidence submitted by the RoyalHighland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, the Aberdeen-Angus CattleSociety and the Scottish Shorthorn Breeders&apos; Association to the danger ofthe spread of foot-and-mouth disease to Scotland through the transit overseasof cattle from England via Dundee, with particular reference to the RoyalHighland Show which is to be held in Dundee in June. The valuable Scottishexport trade in breeding livestock might in their view be put in jeopardyby the continuance of the trade. While we cannot regard this argument asconclusive in view of the considerable movements of cattle which normallytake place in both directions between England and Scotland, we were interested to have this view adverse to the trade from such authoritativesources. The weight of evidence received from farming and cattle-dealinginterests is naturally in favour of the continuance, if possible, of a valuablebusiness. Representatives of the National Farmers&apos; Union, however, readilyagreed that such part of the trade as might be proved to involve unnecessarysuffering to the animals concerned should be disallowed.13. We have been greatly concerned by the evidence about point (iii) (longtrain journeys after disembarkation on the Continent). Members of theCommittee have visited France, Holland and Western Germany; it was not necessary to visit Italy and Switzerland as the trade to those countries hadpractically ceased. Belgium was not included because there was no trade tothat country at the time of our visit to the Continent. The Committee have obtained firsthand evidence that cattle exported to France from Great Britainhave been travelling for long journeys through France to places as far awayas Marseilles and Bordeaux. Some of these journeys may take more than48 hours from the point of disembarkation and there are no Governmentregulations requiring the animals to be fed or watered. This is left to theowner of the animals to arrange and there is nothing to prevent animalsgoing without food and water throughout the rail journey. We considerthat these long journeys on the Continent coming immediately after the seacrossing and probably in many cases also after a lengthy journey or seriesof journeys in this country must inevitably cause the animals undue suffering ;we are convinced that this cannot be justified on grounds of economic advantage. The fact that the bulk of the cattle are not of first quality, and indeed in many cases are old cows, emphasises this point.14. The Members of the Committee who visited France found that thenormal method of slaughtering cattle at Marseilles and Bordeaux is by meansof the pole-axe (known in France as the &quot; English hammer &quot;). This is a method of slaughter which has been prohibited in Great Britain since 1933.15. The Members of the Committee who visited Holland were informed by the Dutch authorities that the Dutch Government has now prohibited there-export of British cattle imported for slaughter. The effect of this regulationhas been to prevent British cattle imported for slaughter being transportedover long distances after arrival in Holland. Most of them are slaughteredat Rotterdam and Amsterdam.   The method of slaughter is by electrical530034 a 2
stunning or captive bolt pistol. The arrangements for handling the animalson disembarkation at Rotterdam are satisfactory and the vehicles in whichthey are carried to the slaughterhouse are very good. In these circumstances,and provided assurances can be obtained that the ban on the re-export ofBritish cattle is effectively maintained, we can see no justification for stopping the export of cattle from Britain to Holland for slaughter.16. Similarly, we consider that the export of cattle for slaughter in theBremen area, for example, should be allowed to continue provided theGovernment of the Bremen State (which is one of the federated states com-prising Western Germany with, we understand, local autonomy in thesematters) can give satisfactory assurances that no British cattle imported forslaughter will be re-exported alive. The same considerations would applyto Hamburg and other German ports.17. Our recommendations on this aspect of the trade may be summarisedas follows:  The trade should be allowed only to small countries such as holland or small autonomous territories, where internal transit after disembarkationcan only be over short distances and where the Government concerned can give satisfactory assurances that the animals will not be allowed to moveout of their territory. The method of slaughter must satisfy british requirements, and conditions of lairage and slaughterhouse facilities mustbe satisfactory.18. We have given some thought to the economic aspects of this trade.The trade began, as described in paragraph 10, in the summer of 1956 and increased steadily, reaching a peak of 5,000 to 6,000 head a week during november and December, 1956. This export trade amounted to some 1 million to  1J million per month and over the whole of 1956 totalledbetween  4  million and  5 million. Exports declined in January with increasing U.K. cattle prices to an average of about 3,000 head a week andfell still further during February. The average weekly figure during Marchwas a little over 2,000 head.19. About two-thirds of the stock exported in 1956 were cows which donot qualify for the fatstock subsidy, the rest being heavyweight steers andheifers on which subsidy had been paid. The percentage of cows increasedtowards the end of the year and the Ministry estimate that at the presenttime only about 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, of exported cattle are in thesubsidy class.20. We understand that the purpose of the subsidy is to encourage theBritish farmer to produce more meat for home consumption. The fact thatsome subsidised cattle have been exported has not prevented the farmerreceiving the benefit of the subsidy. It should be noted that farmers receivethe same total amount of money under the Fatstock Guarantee Schemeirrespective of the current market price of cattle. The subsidy rises and falls to counterbalance changes in the market prices, within the limit of the currentguaranteed price. Whether or not the British taxpayer would have benefitedif these cattle had not been exported is a question to which neither our witnesses nor we have been able to give a categorical answer. The evidencesuggests that the existence of this export trade may have prevented cattleprices from falling even more than they did in 1956. Estimates, which mustbe speculative, have been made that the effect on prices may have been ofthe order of about  7 per head. This would appear to have saved theExchequer considerable sums in subsidy.21. There is no doubt that the comparatively high price of cows culledfrom the dairy herds has been a great help to the dairy farmer and is to
the national advantage in so far as it encourages the earlier weeding-out ofcows on account of low milk yield or for other valid reasons. The FatstockGuarantee subsidy as not payable on these animals. This trade does notappear to have had any noticeable effect on retail meat prices in this country.But the sale abroad of these animals has earned the nation foreign currency,which is presumably to the country&apos;s advantage. The various economic factors are extremely complicated and difficult to assess ; indeed the Board ofTrade have indicated that because of the many imponderables it is hard tosay where the balance of economic advantage lies.22. We feel that there is likely to be a continuing if spasmodic traffic inBritish cattle for slaughter on the Continent; important factors are the relativeprices of cattle in this country and meat on the Continent, and the level of beefimports into this country. Whenever Continental prices rise sufficiently high inrelation to home prices it will be profitable for Continental buyers to importBritish cattle for slaughter. The imposition by Continental countries of import duties or alterations in the rate of duty would also affect the trade.23. Turning now to the conditions under which the export of cattle to theContinent should be allowed, we have a number of recommendations to make.At the Porte24. We have heard favourable comment on the Exported Cattle ProtectionOrder, 1957, which requires animals to be detained for at least 10 hours&apos; reston approved premses at or near the port or airport of embarkation and to be:watered and fed during this period. We are sure that this Order to a largeextent filled a gap in the transit regulations which became obvious when this new trade began to expand. Although some exporters had made private arrangements for the resting and examination of animals at the ports, therewas clearly a pressing need for Government regulations to ensure that animalsunfit to travel were not allowed to leave the ports. We consider that this order is working well and has gone far to achieve its purpose, but feel that it couldbe improved in some respects. We accordingly recommend the following additional safeguards:  (a) all animals should be subjected to a compulsory veterinary inspectionby veterinary officers of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and food during their detention at the port. We understand that although this is not required by the Order the Ministry has, in fact, given instructions that it should be done. In our view it should be laiddown in the Order itself; and the standard set should be highenough to ensure that no animal unfit to travel is allowed to be shipped. We consider that the cost of the veterinary examination should be borne by the shipper;( )) the veterinary officer should be required to issue a licence permittingthe export of the animals examined by him and found fit to be shipped; any animal certified by him as unfit for shipment should,at his discretion, be licensed to the nearest available slaughterhousefor immediate slaughter;(c) we suggest that consideration should be given to the possibility of introducing a &quot; filter price &quot; with a view to preventing the shipment ofany animal which by reason of its age or condition is of less than a prescribed market value; but we recognise that there may be diffi-culties which would render this impracticable;(d) cows heavily in milk should not be passed for export; this does notapply to cows with a small amount of milk, which may reasonably beregarded as &quot; drying off &quot; ;730034 a 3
(e) the Order requires the detention of cattle tor rest, food and water atapproved premises at or near the place of loading. Some premiseshave been approved a few miles outside the ports. We consider this to be undesirable since it is difficult for the premises to be kept underadequate supervision unless they are actually in the port. we accordingly recommend that premises should not be approved unless they are actually within the dock or airport area or adjacent to it,and that the premises should be permanent and covered;(f) we noticed that the lairage at Felixstowe was divided so that notmore than about 40 animals were rested together in each division.We consider that this is highly desirable and recommend that similar provision should be made at all approved lairages. In any lairagewhere the animals are not secured individually we recommend con-tinual supervision by an experienced stockman ;(g) we recommend that minimum requirements should be prescribed asto the amount of water trough space. We suggest that provision for10 per cent, of the animals to drink at any one time would be reasonable;(/z) minimum requirements for hay rack space should be laid down forlairages; these should be sufficient for all the animals to eat simul-taneously;,(z) detention pens should be provided for animals which are unfit forany reason and for the isolation or segregation of animals whichmay be &quot; bulling &quot; during the lairage period ;0) it should be a requirement that not less than 20 lb. of hay shouldbe provided in respect of each animal during the prescribed 10 hourlairage period ; a further 10 lb. should be provided for each periodof 12 hours or part thereof in excess of the first 10.Sea Transit25. It has been suggested that some of the vessels might be rather small,particularly for the longer voyages, for example from Dundee to Bremen orRotterdam, and we recommend that consideration should be given to imposingsome statutory requirements as to the tonnage and suitability of vessels to beused for conveying cattle from Great Britain, bearing in mind the nature of thesea passage ; for instance, certain vessels used in this trade were designed forcoastwise traffic between Denmark and other European ports.26. In rough weather, particularly on small ships, adequate watering of animals seems to us to be impracticable. We recommend ithat vessels carryingcattle to !the Continent should not be allowed to sail if winds of force 6or over are forecast.27. We have heard some criticism of the requirement of the Animals (sea transport) Order of 1930 that cattle being carried by sea shall be securelytied by the head or neck. It has been suggested that this might causerather than prevent unnecessary suffering to animals which have not been used to being tied. We think Hhat this is a valid point and we recommendthat the decision whether to tie such animals on board should be leftto the Mastefs discretion.Internal Transit28. We consider that the regulations in this country governing the transportof animals are really comprehensive and perhaps a model of their kind.We wish to emphasise the need for very strict enforcement by all concerned.
29. We are impressed by the efforts of British Railways to ensure con-siderate handling of the livestock committed to their care. Although railwayregulations are necessarily extensive and complicated, we have seen a guide in simple language about the handling of animals which is givento all members of the staff whose duties bring them in contact with animals.This guide, first issued in 1953, is at once evidence of the difficulties of conducting the transport of live animals without the risk of the occurrence of suffering and proof of the desire and effort of British Railways to do all in their power to minimise such suffering as is inevitable. The guidecontains illustrations by a well known humorous artist and has made a fine contribution, we feel sure, to good handling of livestock by all concerned.Members of the Committee have met a number of people at various levels in British Railways and, without exception, have found a ready appreciation of the need to protect animals from unnecessary suffering.30. In our opinion the practice of charging a rate per truck instead ofper head on some sectors of British Railways must tend to produce over-crowding in railway trucks since it is in the interests of the owners of the cattle that as many as possible should (be carried per truck. The british transport Commission has, we understand, been endeavouring to substitute a head rate for a truck rate universally. The head rate already applies to certain sections (for example, animals transported from Fishguard); therehas, however, been strong opposition from some customers to the extensionof the head rate and so far little progress has been made. It seems to us that the head rate is highly desirable and we hope it will be introduceduniversally.31. We notice tha&apos;t although watering only is required toy statutoryregulation in respect of cattle carried by rail, the railway regulations providefor feeding also and we recommend that this rule should be given statutoryforce.32. We desire to express ourselves strongly on the subject of horns. Wehave been impressed by the evidence put before us both as to the damage and the suffering caused by horns. This evidence is confirmed by the personal knowledge of those members of our Committee who have the closestpractical knowledge of cattle. We can appreciate that to the eye of theconnoisseur a nicely balanced pair of horns may be an ornament of graceand beauty. Nevertheless in our view this aspect is heavily outweighed by considerations of humanity and utility which in this instance coincide.We have considered recommending regulations banning the transit togetherof horned and hornless cattle, but we realise that this would cause greatdifficulty and in any case would not prevent horning among horned cattle.We understand that the Government are in favour of the de-horning of cattle although some breed societies are against it. In view of the importanceof the transit aspect we strongly support the Governments attitude and consider that every effort should be made to encourage the de-horningof cattle generally. It occurs to us that a differential rate of calf subsidy for horned and de-horned animals might encourage disbudding.33. We were disturbed to find that there is much more bruising of cattle in transit by rail in this country than on the Continent. evidence from slaughterhouses in this country and from reports on British cattlearriving in Holland indicate that the incidence of bruising may be as high as 5 per cent. The evidence put before us indicates that sea transport isnot responsible for this; the lower incidence of bruising found in Irishcattle at Rotterdam, despite the generally longer sea journey, and in cattlefrom other Continental countries, appears to indicate clearly that this arisesduring transit in Great Britain.   The Continental railway wagons used for
the carriage of livestock seem to toe muoh toetter than those used in thiscountry. The vehicles are much toigger, and being wider also, provide moreroom for the animals. While the rail gauge on the Continent is the sameas in Great Britain, the wagons have a greater overhang. It may be thatthe design of platforms and bridges in this country would make it impossibleto increase the width of wagons used for the carriage of livestock but wesuggest that British Railways should investigate the possibility of improving the design of these vehicles. We would also emphasise the undesirabilityof carrying cattle in loose-coupled wagons ; to the maximum possible extent they should be carried in trains fitted with continuous brakes.34. We were concerned toy the extent to which some of the cattle involvedin this trade are transported from one market to another in this country before toeing exported. Transit of stock from market to market before final sale appears to toe not uncommon, and when associated with a journeyto a distant port obviously involves added hardship and suffering to the animals concerned. We recognise the difficulty of regulating the internalmovement of livestock and we are unable to offer any practicable suggestion to cut down this travelling. We have considered and rejected as impracticablethe possibility of the zoning of areas to be served by specific ports.35. It has been suggested that British Railways regulations about the useof railway pens for temporary lairage accommodation may be too rigid andthat local railway officials are not given enough discretion to permit animalsin transit to be lairaged when delays or other emergencies make this desirable.We invite the British Transport Commission to permit greater flexibility inthis matter.36. In our view, the electric goad is more humane than the drover&apos;s stick,and we would like to see its use more widely adopted in this country.Air Transport37. We have nothing but praise for the way in which cattle are transportedby air. There seems to be little doubt that this method of transport is by far the most comfortable and least likely to cause any suffering. We commendits greater use.Genera]38. We are conscious of the general concern of people in this country with the welfare of animals. We feel, however, that some people maytend to be rather unrealistic in their approach to the question and we must emphasise that the fact has to be faced that the transport of animals is unavoidable and that generally it cannot be undertaken on a large scaleeven within this country without some degree of suffering by the animalshowever well the regulations governing transport are applied. It is theresponsibility of the farming and cattle-dealing community to see to it thatthey carry out their legitimate business with the greatest possible consideration for the animals concerned.39. We venture to make one general observation in conclusion. Crueltyto animals is often the product of ignorance, sometimes of mere brutality at its worst it is the result of the combination of both. Such instances are,we pride ourselves, rare in this country, yet there is no room for complacencyin this matter. The evidence put before us reveals that our standard of humanity in the treatment of cattle for slaughter is not always everywhereequally high. Humane regulations strictly observed are an important element in preventing cruelty, but it is, we hope, not outwith our terms ofreference to offer a reminder that it is individual care and personal con-sideration by master and man alike which alone can avoid a great dealof suffering by animals destined for slaughter.
Summary of Conclusions and recommendations the following is a summary of our conclusions and recommendations:  (1) except to a very bruited extent the alternative of a carcase trade isnot feasible (paragraphs 8 and 9) ;(2) the journey by sea or air to the Continent is not a sufficient reasonfor imposing a total prohibition on the trade (paragraph 11);(3) the export of cattle for slaughter on the Continent should be allowedonly to small countries or territories where internal transit afterdisembarkation can only be over short distances and where theGovernment concerned can give satisfactory assurances that the animals will not be allowed to be re-exported; the method of slaughter must satisfy British requirements and the conditions oflairage and slaughterhouse facilities must be satisfactory (para-graphs 13 to 17);(4) there is likely to be a continuing if spasmodic demand for Britishcattle for slaughter on the Continent (paragraph 22) ;(5) all cattle should be subjected, at the expense of the shipper, to compulsory veterinary inspection by veterinary officers of theMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food during their detentionat the port under the Exported Cattle Protection Order, 1957 thestandard set should be high enough to ensure that no animal unfitto travel is allowed to be shipped (paragraph 24 (a));(6) the veterinary officer should be required to issue a licence covering the export of animals found fit for shipment; those found unfitshould, at the veterinary officers discretion, be licensed to the nearest available slaughterhouse for immediate slaughter (para-graph 24 (b));(7) consideration should be given to the possibility of introducing a&quot; filter price &quot; to prevent the shipment of any animal of less thana prescribed market value (paragraph 24 (c));(8) cows heavily in milk should not be passed for export (paragraph24(d));(9) premises for the detention of cattle intended for export should notbe approved unless they are actually within the dock or airportarea or adjacent to it; the premises should be permanent andcovered (paragraph 24 (e));(10) approved lairages should be divided so that not more than about40 animals are rested together in each division where the animalsare not secured individually there should be continual supervisionby an experienced stockman (paragraph 24 (/));(11) in approved lairages, minimum requirements should be prescribedas to the amount of water trough space (paragraph 24 (g));(12) in approved lairages, minimum requirements for hay rack spaceshould be laid down (paragraph 24 (h)) ;(13) in approved lairages, detention pens should be provided for thesegregation of animals where necessary (paragraph 24 (/));(14) in approved lairages, not less than 20 lb. of hay should be providedfor each animal during the prescribed 10 hour lairage period afurther 10 lb. should be provided for each period of 12 hours in excessof the first 10 (paragraph 24 (/)) :
31(15) the possibility of imposing statutory requirements as to tonnage andsuitability of vessels used for carrying cattle from Great britain should be considered (paragraph 25);(16) vessels carrying cattle to the Continent should not be allowed tosail if winds of force 6 or over are forecast (paragraph 26);(17) the decision whether to tie animals on board ship should be left tothe Master&apos;s discretion (paragraph 27) ;(18) the regulations governing the transport of animals should be strictlyenforced (paragraph 28);(19) British Railways should charge a head rate rather than a truckrate for the carriage of cattle (paragraph 30);(20) the Railway regulations for the feeding of livestock should be givenstatutory force (paragraph 31);(21) every effort should be made to encourage the disbudding of calves(paragraph 32);(22) British Railways should investigate the possibility of improving the design of railway wagons used for the carriage of livestock (paragraph33);(23) local railway officials should be given greater discretion to permitanimals in transit to be lairaged on railway premises in the event of delay of other emergency (paragraph 35) ;(24) the use of the electric goad should be encouraged (paragraph 36);(25) the transport of animals by air is commended (paragraph 37).We wish to record our appreciation of the services rendered to us by ourSecretary, Mr. T. P. Marten, and the Assistant Secretary, Mr. G. H. Henderson.They have responded with complete efficiency to the sometimes exactingdemands we have made upon them. Our work has been done under a sense of urgency which has necessarily involved pressure on the secretarial staff andwe wish to include in this expression of thanks the subordinate staff of theMinistry who have never failed to complete typing and copying of reportsat very short notice.We are, Sirs,Your obedient Servants,Balfour op BurleighPriscilla TweedsmuirA.

Report on visit to Hull by Mr. Champion and Mr. Gouldon 21st/22nd March, 1957We inspected three premises at Hull approved by the Minister under theExported Cattle Protection Order, 1957, for the detention of cattle intended forexport. In two of the premises cattle were undergoing the statutory rest period.Discussions were held with the Lord Mayor of Hull, an Inspector of the HullCorporation, representatives of British Railways, veterinary officers of the ministry and a private veterinary surgeon employed by the exporters to examine cattlebefore shipment.Cattle Market LairageThis lairage is approved under the Order for the detention of 250 cattle. Therewere no animals on the premises at the time of our visit. The premises arepart of the cattle market set aside for this purpose ; as might be expected withmarket premises, accommodation was excellent and the facilities were adequate.We were informed that additional water tanks were going to be installed. a market employee said (that all cattle were given ample time to drink as muchas they wanted during their period of detention ; he demonstrated the procedure,which appeared to be satisfactory.Edwards Place LairageApproved capacity 200 cows and 20 bulls, or 250 cows. The premises are a former road transport depot adapted for this purpose ; they were littered upto form a straw yard. Watering facilities appeared adequate and there were several tons of hay to draw from. An adequate amount of clean dry beddingWas spread on the floor. At the time of our visit there were about 30 bullsin the lairage. They had arrived from Rednal, near Shrewsbury, at 7 a.m. that day after an overnight journey. They were all separately tied and most werelying down.   Their physical and bodily condition was good.Tower Street LairageApproved capacity 200 cows and 10 bulls (in a separate alley-way). the accommodation for cows consists of two large halls with 50 fit. high walls;much of the roof is at present missing but is to be repaired ; the height of thewalls at present provides adequate protection from the weather. The two hallsare joined by a narrow, open gateway through which the cattle can movefreely. As a result there was a tendency for the animals to congregate in onehall, overcrowding one and leaving the other half empty. A water trough isprovided at present in only one hall but we were assured that another was going to be installed in the second hall. When this is done the gateway shouldbe closed to prevent the animals congregating in one hall. The visit was entirelyunannounced and it was obvious that no prior special preparation had beenmade for our benefit. When we arrived the attendants were distributing amplequantities of excellent hay. There is a detention pen in which to hold animalsabout which there is any doubt as to their fitness to travel. At the time ofour visit there were 173 cows and 10 bulls on the premises. These were therest of the consignment from Rednal which thad arrived that morning. The cowsappeared to be strong and in good physical condition to stand a long journey.There was evidence of tail bruising in a small percentage ; this appeared to be mainly superficial since most of it had disappeared the following morning. Onour second visit we noticed that the broken and bleeding horn of an animalwe had observed the previous day had been dressed and protected. The amountof movement among the animals was normal for yarded cattle the animalswere not agitated although about 90 per cent, were horned cattle. Evidenceof horning was quite small but it would, of course, have been better for the animals if they had been dehorned. All but one of the bulls were lying down.We saw no animal unfit for further travel and no animal of the &quot; boner &quot; type.&quot; Bulling&quot; animals were the main cause of the undue movement among thestock.
OverstockingWe saw no evidence of overstocking or discomfort, although one or twocows had accumulated some imdlk in their udders. We were of the opinionthat there was no need for milking in view of the normal practice adopted for&quot; drying-off&quot; in cows at the end of their lactation.Arrangements for veterinary examinationUnder instructions from the Ministry&apos;s Headquarters all cattle are examinedbefore export by the Ministry&apos;s veterinary officers to ensure that they are fitto travel. In addition, the exporters have arranged for a private veterinaryexamination at Hull for which they pay. We had a discussion with the veterinarysurgeon employed by the exporters who assured us that in no instance had the exporters made any attempt to challenge his decision and that if he said ananimal was not fit to travel it was without question removed from the consign-ment and sent for slaughter locally. He estimated that the casualty rate foranimals brought in by rail since the trade started amounted to about one-halfper cent. Most of those he had refused to pass as fit for further travel werein the early days when, for example, about 12 per cent, in one consignmentwere footsore.   These were bullocks which had always been on grass.Rail transitWe discussed with three local officials of British Railways the arrangementsfor the reception of animals arriving at Hull by rail. They explained that the animals were invariably given water as soon as they were detrained. They saidthat from the railway point of view better arrangements could be made to dealwith cattle sent from an organised collecting centre instead of from a largenumber of different places in small groups. They quoted as an example aconsignment of cattle which were in Hull during our visit; these had comefrom a collecting centre near Shrewsbury and a special train had been laid onto take the animals as speedily as possible to Hull. This had been an overnightjourney. The railway official explained that the incident mentioned in the&quot; Sunday Times &quot; when cattle had been reloaded on to railway trucks because there was no lairage accommodation for them had arisen through circumstancesquite outside the railway&apos;s control. There had been shipping delays and theconsignees of the animals had been unable to accept them from the railwayauthorities. The railway staff had done their best to deal with a difficultemergency situation although, in fact, their responsibility for the animals hadfinished by that time. A similar situation was unlikely to arise again now thatproper approved lairages had been established at Hull. The lairages are withina reasonable distance of the detraining point and the embarkation quays.Fatstock Marketing Corporation premisesWe also visited the premises approved for use by the Fatstock MarketingCorporation. This was a substantial building in very good order and thefacilities provided appeared to be adequate.Sea transport the arrangements made for the shipment of cattle were explained to us andwe inspected the dockside facilities. These seemed to be satisfactory and well organised.
Visits to Dundee and LeithReport by Lady Tweedsmuir and Mr. Clyde HiggsWe visited the port of Dundee on 21st March and inspected animals in lair-ages near the docks and at farm premises about four miles away. We wenton board a vessel in the docks and inspected the cattle accommodation, suibse-quently watching the loading of the animals. We also visited the municipalslaughterhouse.LairagesThe approved lairages at Linlathen, Dundee are situated about four milesfrom the docks and consist of a double cattle court to hold 70 cattle in twolots of 35, and a single court to hold 50 cattle. At the time of our visit therewere seven bullocks in one of the smaller courts ; these animals were loaded forthe docks while we were present and were in good condition.- While the actual buildings appeared to be quite adequate, the immediatelyadjoining ground was very muddy. In addition, the lairages are located on adealer&apos;s premises on Which were numbers of other cattle in open fields.The lairages near the docks, in an adjoining street, are on the municipalslaughterhouse premises, under the charge of the Dundee Superintendent of markets and Slaughterhouses. The accommodation comprises 40 pens with a totalcapacity for 283 animals. When we inspected them there were some 70 animals,including 28 bulls ; all the animals appeared to be tired. The cows were allfairly old and some very thin ; some were bruised. They were awaiting move-ment to the docks for loading the same day.It was stated, in respect of the animals at both premises, that they came quiteregularly from as far as the south-west of England and from Ireland although no precise figures could be given.ShipmentWe were shown the transit shed arrangements for assembling the cattle beforeloading. A vessel, the &quot; Eifeltal&quot; (German, 785 tons, on charter to the ClausenCompany of Copenhagen) had just berthed and we went on board and saw the cattle pens in the holds. This vessel is a small general coastal cargo ship &quot; con-verted &quot; for the trade. We enquired about watering arrangements and were assured that despite the apparent inaccessibility of some of the pens this wascarried out, without difficulty, hy means of buckets. We then watched, fromthe upper deck, the loading down one narrow gangway giving access to the upperhold, from the dockside, and thence by another fairly steep gangway to the lowerhold. There were one or two contretemps when cattle decided to return to thedockside against the flow of traffic; electric goads were used when necessary.On 22nd March we visited Leith Docks. Shipments from Leith are normallymade on Saturdays, with the rest period commencing on Friday night, but on this occasion the vessel was in dry dock and we were only able to see the emptylairage accommodation and discuss loading arrangements. These appeared to bequitei satisfactory, and all concerned were aware of their responsibilities under theExported Cattle Protection Order, 1957.We took the opportunity of visiting a general cargo ship, the &quot; Melrose &quot;(1,800 tons) which on occasion carries cattle to the Continent, and has passengeraccommodation. This was obviously a better sea boat than the &quot; Eifeltal &quot;, larger,and built for such weather as the North Sea.
APPENDIX DReport on visit to Felixstowe and Harwich by Mr. Champion andMr. Gould on 27th March, 1957FelixstoweWe inspected the approved lairage accommodation, which we found to bevery good with ample provision for water and adequate room for the animalsto move and lie down. Hay tracks were provided and a good supply of haywas available. The accommodation was divided into small yards with a centralpassage-way, which appeared to facilitate supervision and management.There are 85 acres of low-lying pasture adjoining the lairage which belong to the port authority and would make suitable summer grazing. The lairageadjoins the detraining point and is quite close to the quay where the animalsare embarked. We examined the embarkation facilities, which seemed to be satisfactory.Six experienced stockmen are employed in handling the animals and we werelinformed that an attendant was always available while animals were in thelairage.There were about 120 cattle dn the lairage during our visit. These were nearly all cows. We discussed the arrangements with the Chairman and the Managerof the Felixstowe Dock &amp; Railway Oompany.   They explained that from theReport on visit to Lydd Airport by Lady Tweedsmuir andMr. Clyde Higgs on 25th March, 1957There were no cattle actually flying on the day of our visit, but we inspectedan aircraft used for the traffic, saw two approved lairages (occupied in one case)and animals in open fields awaiting the commencement of their detention period.The aircraft that we inspected was a nose-loading combined freight and pas-senger &apos;plane. The cattle accommodation consisted of a cage of tubular steel andwire mesh with hessian screening, which occupied only part of the cargo space ofthe &apos;plane. The cage held 7 or 8 animals according to weight, standing athwart-ships. We were informed that the animals were not tethered it had been foundsafer to ship them that way. It was stated that neither the take-off nor the landinghad any effect on the animals. In view of the shortness of the journey (20 minutes),watering was not necessary. We were told that the cost of air travel made ship-ments from Lydd to anywhere south of Calais or Le Touquet uneconomic atpresent. We were informed that it was the practice for one &apos;plane to do a seriesof hourly trips, a lorry-load of cattle being called forward from the detentionpremises to correspond with each flight. Origin in this country was understood to be Martook (Somerset) and Rugby.We visited approved detention premises at Scotney Court Farm, about two milesfrom the airport, with accommodation for 120 animals. There were no animalsin the lairage, but 14 Friesian dry cows good cattle! were grazing on one ofthe fields.We also visited approved premises at Footway Farm, Lydd, also about twomiles from the airport. There were two half-covered yards, with 14 animals in one and 18 in the other. All the animals looked tired. Some were fairly old andthin (but not so ibad as those we saw recently at Dundee. We saw marketlabels from a very wide area in England, including Taunton, Ashbourne and king&apos;s Lynn.We were very favourably impressed with the arrangements at the airport itself,and the aircraft. The Air Line officials seemed to be well aware of their respon-sibilities in connection with this traffic.
inception of the trade they had been most anxious that there should be noquestion of cruelty to ithe animals and they had arranged for a veterinarysurgeon to examine the animals before export. They explained that Felixstowewas now being used as a collecting centre by one of the main exporting com-panies, and that the animals came from a variety of iplaces, mainly in the west of England, in fairly small lots. They thought that when the buyers examined the animals in the lairage they would probably reject about 10 per cent, whichwould go to Ipswich for slaughter.We considered that if 10 per cent, of the poorer quality animals were removed,the remainder would be of good class cow beef quality. Among the worst10 per cent, were some of the &quot; boner &quot; type.All the cattle being exported from Felixstowe are examined by a veterinaryofficer of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food under the ExportedCattle Protection Order, 1957. In our opinion, veterinary inspection should be quite easy in the accommodation provided.All the animals we saw appeared to be physically capable of further travel.HarwichThe lairage consists of converted stables which are quite suitable for thepurpose.  Oattle usually leave Harwich for Rotterdam in batches of 85.In a converted Stable used as a sick bay we saw 8 animals which had been rejected out of a total of 105 because of had tail bruising. This bruising wassevere and appeared to be old standing, there being superficial necrosis of theskin in some of the animals. They gave the appearance of having sufferedthe injury during long travelling, the original injuries probably having beensustained some days .before their arrival at Harwich. The animals had been rejected for export by the owner&apos;s veterinary surgeon as unfit to travel andwere being sent to Islington by road for slaughter.We saw two wagon loads of animals arriving an the lairage while we were there. These had come from Exeter by rail a journey of about 18 hours.The animals were a good type of cow and in only two cases showed evidenceof slight tail bruising. Apart from that they were in good physical condition and quite fit for further travel. There appeared to be adequate experiencedstaff to supervise the cattle at Harwich. The port facilities were satisfactory and well-organised.APPENDIX EReport on visit to Holland by Mr. Champion and Mr. Gouldon 29th and 30th March, 1957During our visit to Holland we were accompanied by Mr. van Keulen, aVeterinary Inspector of the Dutch Government Veterinary Service, who gave usevery assistance.In view of certain reports the Committee had received suggesting that Britishcattle were used in the preparation of foot-and-mouth disease and other vaccineon the Continent, we took the opportunity of visiting at Amsterdam a governmentinstitute engaged in this work. We were given a demonstration of the processesinvolved in making the vaccine. It was made quite clear that there was noquestion of animals being used for vaccine production while alive. About600 tongues per week are used from slaughtered cattle, both imported and home-iproduced. The tongues are cut out at the slaughterhouse in the normal waywithin 10 hours after slaughter and transported to the laboratory for removal ofthe superficial surface for vaccine production.At Rotterdam Airport we inspected the lairage for the accommodation of animals on arrival by air. This is of a temporary nature and we were told that a suitable hall in the new building, at present under construction, would eventually be used for the purpose. At the time of our visit there were about20 animals including one bull in the lairage.   These had arrived that afternoon
from Southend Airport and were due to be removed later in the day forslaughter at Rotterdam. Although there was evidence of tail bruising on severalanimals they were of good quality. From labels on the animals and from theveterinary certificates accompanying them, it appeared that some had travelledfrom Kent to Southend for shipment.The Dutch veterinary officers and transport agents expressed themselvesstrongly in favour of transport by air.It was confirmed that most of the animals landed in Holland were forslaughter locally although there had in the past been occasional forward ship-ments to Germany and less frequently to France and Italy. We were informedthat the re-export of British cattle was now forbidden.On 30th March we visited the docks at Rotterdam. When we arrived therewere some 170 cattle which had been landed early that morning from the&quot; Arne Presthus &quot; a Clausen vessel from Felixstowe. These were in improvisedpens, formed by hurdles and British Railways containers, near the exit fromthe dock area and about 20 yards from the quayside. The animals were in theprocess of being sorted into lots for the slaughterhouses at the various towns.The &quot; Sheringham &quot; (British Transport Commission) with 42 animals on board had just berthed and we were able to go on board, see the animals inpens and in the course of being moved aft for landing. In view of the stateof the tide this was done in a British Railways container holding eight animalsslung by crane from the hold of the vessel to the quayside where they were moved a few yards to the pens ; at other times a gangway is used. The landingwas done without incident except for one case where a oow while &quot; riding&quot;another animal was gored in the udder by a third animal while still on board.(Accidents of this kind are not unusual in farming.) The port veterinary staff were able to administer first-aid in a few minutes.After weighing, the animals were loaded without any hitch in large articulatedroad vehicles, each containing from 20-24 animals, for movement to the variousslaughterhouses; each lorry load was sealed by an officer of the dutch government.The question of tail bruising was discussed at some length and we took theopportunity of inspecting a standard Continental goods wagon. It appeared that although the gauge of the railway was the same as in the United Kingdom,there was considerably more &quot; overhang&quot; allowing an internal width of about  feet compared with about 7 ft. 6 in. in British rolling stock. It was suggestedthat the greater part of the tail damage was done in Britain this was borne out by later evidence.We were then shown over the Rotterdam slaughterhouse which is about three or four miles from the dock area ; as already mentioned the animals are takenithere by road vehicle. We saw every stage of the slaughterhouse procedurefrom the arrival of live animals to the eventual despatch of carcase meat,offals and by-products including manure, and were shown the control roomstfior the cooling plant. The meat is not frozen but merely chilled for transport.Slaughter at Rotterdam is done by means of art electric charge or captive bolt.The slaughterhouse is controlled by a veterinary surgeon as Director. He had prepared for us figures showing the comparative incidence of bruising amongstcattle &quot;received from Great Britain, Ireland and some Continental countries.From the lower incidence in Irish cattle, despite the generally longer sea journey,and the lower figures for the Continental countries, it seems clear that thebruising arises from circumstances during transit in Great Britain.ConclusionIt seems quite clear that no exception can be taken to the arrangements for handling cattle on arrival at Rotterdam whether by air or by sea. Supervisionis in the hands of the Dutch veterinary service and the slaughterhouse arrange-ments are exemplary. It was pointed out to us that it was in the importer^own interest that the animals should be well cared for, and the question was asked, without heat, why any one country should regard itself as having a monopoly of humanitarian feeling for animals.
APPENDIX GReport on visit to France by Lady Tweedsmuir and Mr. Clyde Higgs on29th March to 2nd April, 1957CalaisWe arrived at Calais on the afternoon of Friday, 29th March. We were accompanied during our investigations in Calais by M. Georges (MunicipalVeterinary Officer of Calais), M. Gheerbrant (Secretary General of the CalaisChamber of Commerce) and M. Blajan (Veterinary Officer of the French Ministryof Agriculture in Paris) who gave us every assistance. M. Blajan remained with us throughout our visit to France, and we greatly appreciate the valuable helphe gave us.SlaughterhouseWe were shown the Calais slaughterhouse which, because of war destruction,has at present a slaughtering capacity of only 40 cattle per day with facilitiesfor the slaughter of 8 beasts at a time. An additional slaughterhouse is under construction and is expected to be completed in two years. There will then befacilities for slaughtering 200 cattle per day, 25 at a time.No British cattle were slaughtered at Calais and the unanimous view of thelocal officials was that there was no local demand for meat from British cattleas there were ample local supplies. There are no facilities at Calais for theprocessing of meat from cattle imported for the French army.The hygienic conditions in the slaughterhouse seemed to be adequate. the animals are killed by captive bolt pistol.Report on visit to Germany by Mr. Champion and Mr. Gould on1st April, 1957During our visit we received every assistance from Herr Hilbert, the Chefde Protocol, and were accompanied by Dr. Schulz, the Head of the StateVeterinary Department.We visited the port of Bremen and were shown what were described as temporary arrangements for the landing of animals pending the completion ofthe reconstruction of that part of the dock area. There was, however, nothingmakeshift to be seen. There was a substantial jetty and landing gangway foruse on the tidal river. The pens immediately adjoining, and backing on to a railway loading bank, were strongly built of tubular steel and set in a concreteplatform. The gates to the loading bank, when opened, formed gangways notmerely directing the cattle to the wagons but also bridging the gap at the platformedge. Cattle are moved to the slaughterhouse by rail wagon, a distance ofabout two miles.We visited the Bremen slaughterhouse. The sidings at the slaughterhouseare within the precincts of the slaughterhouse lairage which is part of the generalcattle market, being used temporarily, until the dock slaughterhouse, destroyed during the war, has been reconstructed. The slaughterhouse and lairage leftnothing to be desired in the way of hygiene or treatment of the animals. About600 animals are slaughtered per week. Killing is done by an extremely efficienttype of captive bolt pistol. A high proportion of the traffic is for the UnitedStates Army in Germany and slaughter and meat inspection are done underthe supervision of the veterinary personnel of the United States forces, whowere responsible for both ante- and post-mortem inspection. The carcases whichwe saw were both British and Irish and were of extremely high quality. Therewas evidence of bruising in one case only. As in Holland, lean animals werepreferred for local consumption ; the preference of the United States forces was for very fat cattle.
Disembarkation of British cattleThe motor vessel &quot; Bestevaer&quot; (296 gross registered tons) arrived at Calaisat 9 a.m. on Saturday, 30th March, from Felixstowe after a voyage of about12 hours with 107 cattle on board. We boarded the vessel before disembarkationbegan and visited the cattle holds on the main and lower decks. The conditions on the vessel appeared to be satisfactory and there were no casualties. the captain said he did not sail if the wind was force 5 or over. We were told thatthe animals had been watered by portable troughs on board shortly beforearrival at Calais. They had not been fed on board. It seemed to us doubtfulwhether all the animals could have access to the water and we certainly feelthat in rough weather it would be impossible to ensure that all the animals hadan opportunity to drink.We watched the unloading of the animals which was carried out in a quietand efficient manner. There was no sign of cruelty ; an electric goad was used. Each animal was marked with a branding iron as it came down thegangway. The animals walked off the gangway into a large warehouse dividedinto two equal parts. There was a long water trough in the first part of thebuilding but no water trough in the second. The floor was covered with sawdust.There was no fodder.There were a few bulls in the consignment. These were led straight throughthe first section and tied to rings in the wall of the second. They had no opportunity to drink. About half the consignment were driven through intothe second section after only a few minutes in the first. Some of these hadno opportunity to drink if they had wished to. Few of the animals left in thefirst section showed any interest in the water.The loading of the animals into railway wagons started as soon as theunloading of the vessel was completed. They were loaded 17 per wagon intolarge wagons double the size of the normal British cattle wagon. The loadingof the animals is the responsibility of the consignor. There was continuousbraking equipment in wagons. A large amount of straw was scattered in thewagons. We were told that the cattle trains were given priority and travelledas rapidly as possible to their destination. Loading was completed by 11 a.m.but the train was not due to leave till 3 p.m. Thirty-five of the cattle were going to Bordeaux and the rest to Paris. The journey to Paris would take about12 hours and to Bordeaux about 36 hours.We were told that the normal practice of the consignors was not to arrangefor a stop en route for feeding and watering, at least in regard to consignmentsto Paris and Bordeaux where these particular animals were going ; they wouldbe watered on arrival at their destination.We left Calais for Marseilles at 3 p.m. on Saturday with the intention of arriving there in time to see the arrival on Sunday morning of British cattlewhich had left Calais on Friday morning.MarseillesUnloading of British cattleAccompanied by the owner of the cattle and the Director of the Municipalslaughterhouse, both of whom were most helpful and co-operative, we watchedthe arrival at Marseilles of 96 cattle in 7 railway wagons. The animals arrivedat 11 a.m. on Sunday, 31st March, having been entrained at Calais at 10 a.m.on Friday, 29th March ; they had therefore been 49 hours in the wagons. Theyhad left Felixstowe on Thursday, 28th March. Market labels showed that someof the animals had come from Guildford, King&apos;s Lynn, Ashbourne and Somerset.The animals were all standing in the wagons. When unloaded they were emptybut not distressed. We had been told at Calais that imported catde were notfed or watered en route because the trains were given priority and travelledas rapidly as possible to their destination. At Marseilles a contrary view was expressed and we were told that the cattle would have been watered twice inthe trucks, in the Paris and Lyons marshalling yards. We could not escape thefeeling however, that it would be physically very difficult to water a truckload
of 17 cattle adequately without unloading them. Furthermore, the time factordid not point to their having been watered en route. It is not the responsibilityof the French railways to ensure that the animals are watered and there are no government regulations requiring this to be done. Under the French railwayregulations it is left to the owner of the animals to decide whether or not theyshould be fed and watered en route; the French railways will arrange to stop the trains at certain points for this to be done at the request of the owner, whois given a ticket at a reduced price so that he may travel with them and make thenecessary arrangements; the trains which are stopped under these provisions are moved on after a stay of 24 hours. No representative of the owner hadtravelled with this particular consignment.The animals were taken by lorry from the station to holding premises near the slaughterhouse where they were to rest two or three days before slaughter.They were fed and watered and kept in good covered and open lairages.SlaughterhouseThe Director of the slaughterhouse very kindly showed us round. The premiseswere clean and the arrangements for handling the animals seemed very efficient.There are facilities for slaughtering about 50 cattle at a time. Bulls are killedwith a captive holt pistol and the rest with a pole-axe. Imported British cattleare slaughtered for local consumption as fresh meat. There is, however, noenthusiasm for this as it is considered too fat.BordeauxOn Monday, 1st April, we were shown the municipal slaughterhouse and cattlemarket at Bordeaux by the Director. A consignment of 35 cattle which we had seen at Calais on Saturday, 30th March, had arrived at Bordeaux early onMonday morning. We saw these animals, which were sold for prices ranging from about  65 for a medium quality barren cow to  50 for a poor &quot; boner &quot;.All the British cattle were to be used for corned beef for the French army.On detrucking, the cattle were driven straight into the market without food and probably without water as they were expected to be sold and slaughteredwithin a few hours. We were told that they would only be fed and wateredif they were not sold that day.In comparison with the magnificent local animals in the market the Britishcattle were a very poor lot and we were conscious that they were a bad advertise-ment for British livestock.We saw the slaughterhouse in operation, including the use of the pole-axe.The standards of cleanliness and meat storage facilities were excellent, both here and at Marseilles.APPENDIX HWritten Evidence submitted to the CommitteeMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.Board of Trade.Boston Borough Council.Colchester Borough Council.Dundee Corporation.Essex County Constabulary.Great Yarmouth County Borough Council.Kent County Council.Kent County Constabulary.King&apos;s Lynn Borough Council.
