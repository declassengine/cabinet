SECRETNIGERIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies as my colleagues know, the Nigeria constitutional conference will open inLondon on 23rd May. It will be attended by some sixty to seventy Nigeriandelegates and advisers, representative of all the more important shades of political opinion in the Federation, and will probably last till the end of June.Outline of the Present Constitution2. Since 1954 Nigeria by far the largest of the dependent territories andwith 33 million inhabitants has been a Federation of three Regions (North, Eastand West), the Southern Cameroons, and the Federal territory of Lagos (the Federalcapital).  The residual powers are with the Regions.3. This constitution was devised by my predecessor as the only way to saveNigeria from disintegration, such is the diversity of the country and the deep-seateddistrust of the major tribes Hausa/Fulani, Ibo and Yoruba for each other (notto speak of the fears of the many minority groups for these larger tribes).4. There are large Nigerian majorities in all the executive and legislativeorgans of government throughout the Federation, with the sole exception of theSouthern Cameroons Executive Council where there are four British to fourAfricans. There are no British officials, except the Regional Governor, in theEastern and Western Executive Councils, no British officials in the LegislativeHouses of these Regions, and only three in the Federal and Northern MinisterialCouncils (in addition to the Governor-General and Regional Governor respectively)and in their Legislative Houses.5. The powers of the Federal Government include such matters essential tothe administrative unity of the country as defence, external affairs (in so far asresponsibility is delegated by the United Kingdom Government), the Nigeria police,major communications, ports, currency, exchange control, external trade and external loans.6. The term &quot; internal security &quot; is unknown to the Nigerian constitution,but &quot; public safety and public order &quot; is a concurrent subject, and the UnitedKingdom Governments ultimate responsibility for internal security is exercisablethrough the Governor-General of the Federation who has full discretionary powerover the &quot; use and operational control&quot; of the Nigeria police. Police supply ishandled by the Federal Executive and Legislature in the normal Parliamentaryway, but is within the portfolio of the (British) Chief Secretary of the Federation..7. The Governor-General and the Regional Governors still have full reserved powers and considerable discretionary powers. The reserved powers have been used on three occasions in the East under the present constitution.The Demand for Regional Self-Government in 1957 and for Independence for theWhole Country in 19598. When the last London conference met in 1953, the two major SouthernParties, Chief Awolowo&apos;s Action Group (in power in the West) and Dr. Azikiwe&apos;national Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (N.C.N.C.) (now in power in theEast), had presented a categorical demand for &quot; Dominion status &quot; for Nigeriaas a whole by 1956. The majority party in the North, the Northern People&apos;sCongress (N.P.C.), led by the Sardauna of Sokoto, now Premier of the northern region, had opposed the demand knowing that independence so soon would meandomination of the &quot; backward &quot; North by the more &quot; educated &quot; Southerners.They had put forward as an alternative formula self-government &quot; as soon aspracticable.&quot;9.   The acute crisis which resulted nearly split the country and there was serious rioting, with loss of life, in Kano which was prevented from spreading only by prompt and firm action. The crisis was eventually resolved by my predecessorwhen he secured agreement for the present federal form of Government and, as51594
regards self-government, to the following formula, recorded in the ConferenceReport (Cmd. 8934): -&quot; The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Conference thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government were not prepared to fix a definite date for self-government for Nigeria as a whole, the more so as the Northerndelegation, representing over half the population of Nigeria, was unable to depart from its policy of self-government as soon as practicable. TheConference eventually accepted a declaration of policy that in 1956 her majesty&apos;s Government would grant to those Regions which desired it full self-government in respect of all matters within the competence of the regional governments, with the proviso that there should be safeguards to ensure thatthe Regional Governments did not act so as to impede or prejudice theexercise by the Federal Government of the functions assigned to it now, or as amended by agreement in the future, or in any way make the continuanceof federation impossible.&quot;10. A conference was to have been held last autumn to work out how to implement the 1953 promise of Regional self-government, including the safeguards,but it had to be postponed because of the Foster Sutton Tribunal of Inquiry intoDr. Azikiwe&apos;s corrupt practice and Ministerial misconduct in relation to the AfricanContinental Bank.11. At the forthcoming conference the West and the East will claim the promise of Regional self-government, and my predecessor^ undertaking will, ofcourse, have to be honoured. At the same time I shall do my utmost to secureexplicit provisions for &quot; good &quot; government, for example, by safeguarding thepublic services, the judiciary and the police from any form of political interference,and by preserving the independence of the Attorneys-General (in relation tocriminal proceedings) and of the Auditors of Government accounts. (In the caseof the Nigeria police this will mean keeping them as a federal force under thediscretionary control of the Governor-General.) I also intend to insist uponadequate safeguards both for the Federal Government and for the continuance of federation in accordance with the proviso to the undertaking given in 1953, as recorded in paragraph 9 above.12. The Northern Region have said they do not want Regional self-government till 1959. But in view of the new demand for independence forNigeria as a whole in 1959 (with which I deal below), it is quite possible that atthe conference they will claim Regional self-government now. If they do, their claim will have to be met.13. The most recent development, undoubtedly inspired to a large extent by the grant of independence to Ghana, is the demand for independence for theFederation as a whole, within the Commonwealth, in 1959. A resolution to this effect was passed nem. con., in the Federal House of Representatives on 26th March,the Northern members (who hold half the 184 elective seats) supporting.14. Much at the conference will depend on how far the feelings of unity soevident in the debate of 26th March-survive, and surmount, the various serious difficulties (e.g., on the allocation of revenues, the creation of more Regions orStates, the division of powers between the Federal and Regional Governments, thecontrol of the police) which are bound to come up when these controversial issues are discussed. Moreover there is no doubt that Nigeria will not be ready for independence, in any normally accepted sense of the term, so soon; and that thereis real danger for a good long time to come of the country disintegrating, and of democratic institutions disappearing, if a guiding and restraining British hand is removed from the Federal Government (and probably from the North also). Inaddition there may be administrative chaos in the Eastern Region within a year ortwo of Regional self-government, thanks to the largely corrupt, inept andopportunist rule of Dr. Azikiwe&apos;s N.C.N.C. in that Region. ,15.   On the other hand we cannot overlook certain factors:  (a) the emotional pressure, for independence is strong, certainly in the South;(b) to resist too strongly and get all Nigerian politicians against us would bevalueless and dangerous, for we could hardly control the country if the;population were all against Us; we must maintain a peaceful and quiet
Nigeria, if only, to put it no higher, in our ultimate interests as a tradingnation (United Kingdom exports to Nigeria run at the rate of 50-60 million annually). To lose the co-operation and affection ofNigerians would be to risk future good relations, when the country isindependent.. 16. This is the dilemma with which we are faced: either to give independencetoo soon and risk disintegration and a breakdown of administration; or to hangon too long, risk ill-feeling and disturbances, and eventually to leave bitternessbehind, with little hope thereafter of our being able to influence Nigerian thinkingin world affairs on lines we would wish.17. After careful consultation with the Governor-General and the threeRegional Governors, I have come to the conclusion that if the demand for independence in 1959 is put forward by the major Parties in unison as I believe islikely it would be dangerous to resist it overtly. Indeed to do so might only have the effect of uniting the Nigerians against us at present our prestige and influence are high and increasing the pressure. If, however, we appear to yieldwith good grace while making no unconditional promises at this stage, we should retain the present goodwill and may be able to postpone the final transfer of power,certainly until late 1960 and perhaps even till 1961 or 1962. (We know thatChief Awolowo, for example, does not really expect independence to be administratively possible till towards the end of I960 at the earliest.) In themeantime anything may happen: if, for example, the Ghana experiment shouldfail, or administration break down in Eastern Nigeria, enthusiasm for earlyindependence may cool.18. In addition to the demand for independence in 1959, I shall be underpressure to agree to the removal of the three ex-officio Members (the Chief Secretary,the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary) for the Federal Council of Ministers;and if the demand is pressed hard I think I must concede it, both to preservegoodwill and because Nigerians ought to have the opportunity to learn the hardway while a sufficient number of overseas officers are still there to help. The finalchange would not then be so sudden. I may be able to keep the Financial secretary and the Attorney-General, and I shall if I can though I am not optimistic; but theChief Secretary will almost certainly have to go, being replaced by a Prime Minister,and the post of Deputy Governor-General will then have to be created so that the holder can assist the Governor-General with defence (including the police), external affairs, and the Federal public service. (This would be on lines similar to what we had in the Gold Coast in 1954 until independence.)19. It will probably be necessary, at some stage in the conference, for her majesty&apos;s Government to make a declaration on these matters, and subject ofcourse to how the conference may go, I would propose, // necessary, to go as far asa declaration on the following lines, bearing in mind that the life of the presentHouse of Representatives is due to run till late 1959:  &quot; The United Kingdom Government have noted the resolution passed inthe House of Representatives on the 26th March in favour of independence forNigeria within the British Commonwealth in 1959. In particular they welcome the increased sense of unity among the political parties which enabled theresolution to be adopted without a dissentient vote. For their part the UnitedKingdom Government have always firmly believed that it is in the best interestsof the peoples of Nigeria that the unity of the country should be preserved.The United Kingdom Government have agreed to certain changes in theconstitution to permit the appointment of a Prime Minister at the Centre andthe withdrawal of the ex-officio Members from the Council of Ministers duringthe period until the life of the present House of Representatives comes to anend. (These changes will take effect as soon as the constitutional instrumentshave been amended.)If, in 1959, it is still the wish of the Nigerian people to attain independence within the Commonwealth, and assuming that in the interim the governments in the Federation have demonstrated their integrity and capacity for good government, the United Kingdom Government will consult with all the nigerian Governments about arrangements for the final transfer of power.These arrangements would have to include special constitutional provisions tosafeguard tribal and religious minorities, and full regard would be paid to the
4 mm-HP,wishes of both the Northern and Southern sections of the Trust Territory ofthe Cameroons under United Kingdom administration and to the UnitedKingdom Governments responsibilities under the United Nations Charter andthe Trusteeship Agreement.Meanwhile, certain preliminary administrative steps are being taken. Ithas been agreed that the Government of the Federation will assume responsibility for the Nigerian military forces on 1st April, 1958. An expertstudy of the problems connected with the establishment of a Central Bank andof a Nigerian currency has already begun with the assistance of an adviser fromthe Bank of England; and further measures will be taken towards trainingNigerians for a future foreign service.&quot;20. Subject to developments in the meantime, I would expect it to benecessary to ask the United Nations to hold a plebiscite in the British Cameroonsin 1959 or 1960.21. I seek the concurrence of my colleagues in the course outlined above, andin making, if necessary, a declaration on the lines set out in paragraph 19.A. L.-B.7th May, 1957.
