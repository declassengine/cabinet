SECRET Copy No.    g3C. (57) 1387th June, 1957CABINETPERSIAN GULFMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsRecent despatches from Her Majesty&apos;s Representatives in Tehran, Bagdadand Bahrain have discussed the major question of future British policy in thePersian Gulf on which I should welcome my colleagues&apos; views.2. -A summary and analysis of these despatches is at Annex 1. The basicfacts about the Shaikhdoms of the Persian Gulf form Annex 2. As regards thelatter I would particularly draw my colleagues&apos; attention to the great diversity of,among other things, revenue and development among the various Shaikhdoms.This sometimes makes generalisations about them misleading. I would alsoemphasise that these Shaikhdoms are not Colonies but British-protected Statesjealous of their internal independence and proud of being Arab.3. Broadly speaking Her Majesty&apos;s Representatives advance two opposingviews on the Gulf.  In their extreme forms these are:  (a) the present position is anachronistic or at least regarded as such by other interested countries, including some of our allies. We must either go forward or we shall be forced to quit. Federation of the Shaikhdomsor association with the Bagdad Pact, or both, offers a constructivepolicy. Anything other than a positive forward looking policy wouldbe drift;(b) there is no justification for the assumption that the Gulf States and theirrelationship with Her Majesty&apos;s Government cannot continue more orless as they are. Just because this relationship has existed for100 years is no reason why it should now be wrong. Our position stillaccords with the general wishes of the legitimate Rulers of theShaikhdoms and of most of the peoples in the area.4. In my opinion the basis of the policy to be pursued by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment must lie somewhere between these two extremes with a biastowards (b). I reject federation because the Rulers concerned do not want it andwe dismiss association with the Bagdad Pact at least in the immediate future for the same reason and because we do not want in Kuwait a reaction like thatin Jordan in 1955. On the other hand it is unrealistic not to recognise that theworld is changing and that we must be prepared to make adjustments in ourrelations with the Gulf States to meet these changes. This does not mean thatadjustments need to be drastic or fundamental. Indeed by taking too sudden orfar-reaching initiatives we may well not forestall trouble but precipitate it.The Importance of Our Stake5.   Our major interests in the Gulf are:  (a) to ensure the supply of oil. Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia in addition tothe Shaikhdoms supply oil to the Western world and export all or someof their output through the Gulf. At present 50 per cent, of the UnitedKingdom consumption derives from Kuwait alone. Dependence of western Europe&apos;s economy on oil will increase for many years to come;Printed for the Cabinet. June 1957
(b) to strengthen our balance of payments to which the operations of british oil companies in the Middle East make an important constribution;(c) to bar the spread of Communism in the Middle East and subsequentlybeyond.   This presupposes the defence of the Gulf against the Egyptian-led extreme Arab nationalism under cover of which the Sovietj&apos;Government at present chooses to advance;id) strategically the British position in the Gulf helps to assure communicationsof the Bagdad Pact countries in peace and war. The Gulf is on thenatural air route between the United Kingdom and our interests east of Suez. Our friendly relations with the Sultanate of Muscat and Omanensures the iine of communication from the Gulf of Aden. The Gulfis an area of the world where we may still hope to retain military controlrelying on our own resources alone.6. It is common ground that our position in the Gulf has hitherto enabled usto secure our interests. Generally speaking we and the local Governments have -operated well in maintaining stability and the flow of oil and we have alwayshad in reserve superior physical force which can be effectively employed in the last resort.New Factors7. But the situation is continually developing and compared with even tenyears ago new and important factors in the Middle East situation are at workagainst our position. The Soviet Union has intruded in the Arab world, a**d egypt and Syria are openly antagonistic to the Western position there, pan-Arabismat.present led by Egypt has spread to many parts of the Gulf and can hardly be prevented from eventually spreading to the whole, the Israeli issue has exacerbatedand will continue to exacerbate Anglo-Arab relations, the Suez crisis has furthershaken these relations, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia have gained considerably in strength and confidence and Saudi Arabia and Iran in ambition, our positiongenerally may become increasingly the target of an Afro-Asian attack pressing usto relinquish authority in the Gulf as we have done elsewhere, the United Statesand not Britain is now the predominant Western Power in the Middle East. Onthe other hand, we have succeeded in maintaining a fund of confidence among the rulers of the Gulf. Our firm action at Buraimi and our willingness to send forces to Bahrain last year, their use in Bahrain and the belief elsewhere that we wereprepared to use them have demonstrated and maintained confidence in our determination to fulfil our responsibilities. Even the future decline in ourconventional military strength need not be locally reflected in the Gulf.Arguments against the Need for Change8. The Political Resident in Bahrain argues that there is no present reasonto suppose either that we shall be unable to defend the Rulers against external attackor that they, with our assistance, will fail to deal with foreign subversion. Evenif this were untrue, any move in the direction of alternative arrangements acceptable to ourselves would be self-denying because it would at once destroy the confidence of the Rulers and cause Kuwait and perhaps others to look for protection elsewhere.Future prospects . I agree with this assessment though we are not confident that the present state of affairs will necessarily last indefinitely. Apart from internal dynastic,constitutional, labour^ or social upheavals which might threaten stability and theBritish connection the situation in the Gulf is to a significant extent at the mercyof external events. Collapse in Iraq (or Saudi Arabia) would of course at oncecreate an extremely dangerous situation. The capture of Jordan by our enemieswould also have its effect (though here we could point to the fact that this was due in fact to Jordan renouncing the British connection). Egyptian propaganda byradio, Press and agents will be intensified and may achieve an influence seriouslythreatening our position. Its effect is the greater because it uses the same languageand idom of thought as the inhabitants of the Persian Gulf States. I see no way ofproviding a sure shield for the Gulf against these external influences but somethingcan be done to moderate the effect of hostile propaganda by counter-measures ofour own.
10. We have no choice at the present time save to adopt a temporising policy.If change becomes inevitable we should endeavour to ensure that its purpose andthe way it takes place should as far as possible be in accordance with our interests.It is particularly important that any liberalisation of the regimes designed to meetgenuine grievances or to mollify reformist elements shall not go so far as tocripple the powers of the Ruling Families or compel them to bow to nationalistdemands at the expense of their own attachment to us.The United States11. In seeking support for the maintenance of our position the attitude of theUnited States Government is of major importance. Discussion at the BermudaConference in March showed that the United States Government are conscious of the importance of the Western stake in the Gulf, though Mr. Dulles wasimperfectly acquainted with the nature of our position. Although this is one of thequestions which officials are now discussing with their opposite numbers in theUnited States Government in accordance with arrangements decided upon atBermuda, we can hardly hope in any near future to obtain from the United Statesmore than a general understanding of, and moral support for, our position in theGulf as the chief guarantee of Western interests there. It must also beremembered that the United States are committed to support Saudi Arabia whoseinterests are in many cases in conflict with those of our protected Rulers, whileany apparent increase in United States power in the Gulf would be interpretedlocally as a diminution of our own and the net result might be the weakening of theWestern position as a whole.Future Policy12.   I propose to pursue the following policy in the immediate future:  (a) We should seek generally to maintain our position by political rather than military means. This connotes among other things the expansion ofinformation and British Council work in the wealthier and moredeveloped Shaikhdoms and of our economic and technical help for development in the backward and poorer Shaikhdoms where oil hasnot yet been found. It also involves the training of adequate numbersof Arabic-speaking officials. It means spending more money thanheretofore but the increases required can be measured in tens ratherthan hundreds of thousands of pounds and nowhere in the world willthey pay a better dividend.(b) We should eschew any &quot; grand design &quot; for the whole of the Persian Gulfand retain the maximum flexibility in order to deal effectively with the wide variety of problems in the different States.(c) At the same time we should continue to regard our position in the persian gulf as an integral whole, no part of which can be weakened or resignedwithout affecting the rest. It is of paramount importance to retain theconfidence of the Rulers in our ability and determination to protect them. We should therefore as far as possible make no concessions which would jeopardise the territorial integrity of the Persian GulfStates and we should continue to protect them against any encroachmentby their more powerful neighbours, particularly Saudi Arabia. At thesame time we should watch for an opportunity to improve relationswith Saudi Arabia provided this can be done without paying a damaging price.(d) Some British troops should be retained in the Persian Gulf, together with aircraft and naval vessels, as an earnest of our determination and ability to deter or repel aggression. But these forces should not be used exceptin case of extremity without consent of the Rulers.(e) While carefully avoiding any open interference in internal affairs, we should encourage the Rulers to base their regimes on as broad a consent oftheir people as is practicable and as is consistent with the maintenanceof stability. We should wait for opportunities to use our influence,provided this can be done unobtrusively, in the direction of more efficient government and of wider participation in the business ofgovernment, e.g., by including nominated or elected members from outside the Ruling Families in committees controlling GovernmentDepartments, as is the case in Bahrain.
(/) Local Governments should be encouraged to take over from us anyprimarily internal functions which we exercise on their behalf such aspostal services, &amp;c, as they become capable of doing so.ig) We should seek to obtain American understanding of our position in theGulf as the best guarantee of Western interests there including those ofUnited States oil companies.(h) Closer co-operation between the Persian Gulf States and independent states friendly to the West, e.g., Iraq and Pakistan, should be encouraged, for example by extending the existing arrangements forthe secondment for service in the Persian Gulf States of teachers andother officials from Iraq and police and military personnel fromPakistan.(/) We should resist Iranian attempts at encroachment in the Gulf. We should seek to settle by appropriate means including arbitration -kt- internaldisputes between the Persian Gulf States, and disputes between these states and the neighbouring independent States, e.g., on the division ofthe Persian Gulf sea-bed.(/) We should gradually inculcate the^dea that the Arabs alone cannot protectthemselves against Israel that the West are the only reliableguarantors of their independence.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1.5th June, 1957.Annex IA. SUMMARY OF VIEWS OF HER MAJESTVS REPRESENTATIVESTehran despatch No. 140 of 8th December, 1956, and Bagdad despatch No. 5of 4th January discussed various aspects of the United Kingdom&apos;s position in thePersian Gulf. The Political Resident, Persian Gulf, replied in Bahrain despatch no. 12 of 24th January and H.M. Ambassador at Tehran commented further inhis despatch No. 37 of 28th March with particular reference to Saudi-Iranianrelations.2. H.M. Ambassador at Tehran argues that the traditional military reasonsfor the British position in the Persian Gulf have disappeared with the loss of theIndian Empire and of our traditional footholds in Egypt, Palestine, Jordan and iraq. These changes, he says, have turned the Persian Gulf into a &quot; double-endedcul-de-sac.&quot;3. Secondly, Sir Roger Stevens says, the continuance of the British positionin the Persian Gulf is an irritant to other States in the area, particularly Iran, whodisapproves of what she regards as out-dated imperialism and British support forbackward unenlightened Rulers against the &quot; rising tide of popular discontent.&quot;Iran believes that British influence must eventually disappear and when thathappens she fears that the Shaikhdoms will fall into &quot; the Arab lap.&quot; She hopes,however, to secure windfalls for herself in the shape of expanded oil revenues,particularly from the Continental Shelf, a dominant naval and mercantile positionand the general increase in prestige to be gained by asserting the Persian positionin the &quot; Persian &quot; Gulf. For this reason Iran has maintained her absurd claimto Bahrain and seized the small island of Farsi which we regard as belonging toKuwait.4. Thirdly, Sir Roger Stevens doubts whether we are able to continue holdingthe present position. If Iran were to join forces with Saudi Arabia, who also hasextensive claims in the area (possibly through the medium of a Saudi-Iraniandefence Pact which the Shah is believed to have raised at his recent visit to SaudiArabia), Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs position might become difficult to hold.
Even now we do not find it.easy to discharge our obligations except at great political cost, e.g., over Buraimi, and in some cases, e.g., over Farsi, we have been unwilling to enforce the. claims of the Ruler of Kuwait against Iran. Do we notrun the risk of being in the long run unable to fulfil our commitments to the states under our protection while at the same time by our very presence we alienatethe sympathies of the larger neighbouring States, Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia, and make it difficult for America, who has very friendly relations with Saudi arabia and Iran, to support us?5.   Sir Roger Stevens sums up our remaining assets as:  (i) oil,(ii) Naval bases,(iii) sea communications.He describes our liabilities as:  (a) our Treaties with the Rulers;(b) the threat to sterling if the Ruler of Kuwait switched from sterling todollars;(c) &quot;the outmoded 19th Century conception: prestige.&quot;6. H.M. Ambassador at Bagdad agrees broadly with Sir Roger Stevens&apos;views.  He adds:  (a) the Persian Gulf is Iraq&apos;s only access to the sea and is the outlet for oilnot piped to the Mediterranean. It is Iraq&apos;s main trade route and achannel by which military aid against Russia would be supplied;(b) so long as Iraq remains friendly she would rather see the independentShaikhdoms protected by the United Kingdom than falling underthe influence of Saudi Arabia. If, however, Iraq became hostile, or if our ability to protect the Shaikhdoms declined, Iraq&apos;s attitude might change rapidly;(c) Iraq has not abandoned a shadowy claim to Kuwait and a more shadowyone to the Al Hasa province of Saudi Arabia.7. The Political Resident considers that federation of the Gulf States intosomething resembling a viable unit should be dismissed as impracticable in the foreseeable future. Other possible solutions proposed by H.M. Ambassadors atTehran and Bagdad are:  (a) association of these States strategically and politically with the bagdad pact. Such association, it is claimed, would be assisted by participation of America in the Pact and would eliminate the possibility of a clash between British and American interests in the area; or(b) a joint guarantee by Saudi Arabia and Iran, with possibly Iraqi and american support, to underwrite the independence and territorial integrity of the Persian Gulf States, in return for which the independent states concerned would be associated with our defence arrangements.As a variant of this Sir Michael Wright has mentioned a Persian GulfCouncil composed of Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdomand the United States, which might assume some responsibilities inthe Gulf.In support of (b) above Sir Roger Stevens says:  &quot; I am steadily coming round to the belief that in the long run thepreservation of our vital economic interests in Kuwait, Iran and theGulf Shaikhdoms and with them our strategic interests in the area, will depend on the progressive transfer of our direct political responsibilities for the small Gulf Shaikhdoms to Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, withall due safeguards both for our own interests and those of theShaikhdoms themselves. And the better we can make our relationswith the three major Gulf Powers and the relations between these powers themselves, the more effective these safeguards will be.&quot;Sir Michael Wright considers that it would be &quot; to our advantage thatthe situation in the Persian Gulf should develop in a way which would be acceptable to the larger States with an interest there.&quot;
8.   The Political Resident has replied as follows:  (a) the importance of our position in the Persian Gulf is axiomatic ;(b) there is no present need for the Gulf States and our relationships with themto undergo substantial change. Pressure for change in the persian gulf is largely due to external causes. So far such pressure has produced no effect in Muscat or the Trucial States. There is nocohesive political movement in Qatar. In Bahrain there is relief atthe suppression of the Committee of National Union. Its failure hasadded to the confidence of the Ruling Family and paved the way for adminsitrative reforms. The Ruling Family of Kuwait is virile andresilient but the situation there is potentially more dangerous thanelsewhere because the politically conscious minority is better informed and includes a larger number of foreign Arabs. The intervention inEgypt has affected our position in.Kuwait and Qatar, temporarilystrengthened it in Bahrain and caused no essential change in the TrucialStates and Muscat. We can recover lost ground in Kuwait. Qatarwill remain unstable but manageable: in any case oil will probablybe exhausted there within 20 years ;(c) association of the Persian Gulf States with other Powers, e.g., the bagdad pact, would be distasteful to nearly all Rulers. Their view of the Pactis in any case coloured by Egyptian propaganda. If we suggested tothe Persian Gulf States that they should associate themselves with other states in the outside world, Kuwait might tend to join the Egypt-Syria-Saudi axis; Qatar would tend to join Saudi Arabia; the Ruler ofBahrain would have to face growing popular discontent if he followedhis own preference and relied only on his friendship with us ; whileonly if oil were found in Muscat might the Sultan in the long run wishto join the Pact though still probably preferring to rely only on theUnited Kingdom. Sir Bernard Burrows writes that his consideredview is that &quot;any attempt by us to associate the Persian Gulf states in any way with the Bagdad Pact (with the possible exception of Muscatin the distant future) would not only be doomed to failure but wouldbe the step most calculated to destroy our position and to drive at leastKuwait into precisely the opposite camp &quot;;id) since federation is a non-starter, the alternative to proposals for association with outside Powers is to leave the situation more or less as it is. Butwe should:(i) strengthen ties  between the Persian Gulf States  and otherneighbouring States friendly to the West, e.g., Iraq and Pakistan(but not Iran);(ii) settle disputes between British-Protected States and independentneighbouring States, e.g., delimitation of the Persian Gulf seabed and ownership of islands when the opportunity offered.Other States in the Persian Gulf, e.g., Iran, will have to accept thecontinuance of Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ special position and learnto live with it. But provided they do this they should be given ample opportunity to develop commercial, technical and other relationships with the Persian Gulf States;(e) Her Majesty&apos;s Government should allow the Persian Gulf States to developinternally in their own way and only normally give advice in extremecases of maladministration or when there is danger of subversion.B-ANALYSIS OF HER MAJESTY&apos;S REPRESENTATIVES&apos; VIEWS9. The Political Residents views agree generally with previous thinking onour policy in the Persian Gulf.Stability in the Individual Gulf States10. The Political Residents analysis of the political situation in the variousStates indicates that the position is fairly satisfactory and that our relations areoutwardly returning to normal after the strains imposed by the intervention inEgypt. The Ruler of Kuwait has recently given striking proof of his continuedconfidence in Her Majesty&apos;s Government by consulting the Political Resident for
7 -    221the first time about the problem of the succession and asking his views aboutvarious candidates. He has also shown himself well satisfied wth the arrangementsfor the investment of the Kuwait reserves in the United Kingdom. Sir RogerStevens rightly points to the danger to sterling which would arise from a decision by the Kuwaitis to transfer their reserves to dollars, but he overlooks the fact thatany alteration in the present status of Kuwait in the direction he suggests, i.e.,towards a Saudi-Iranian guarantee and/or the association of the Persian GulfStates with the Bagdad Pact would be likely to weaken the Ruler&apos;s confidence in her Majesty&apos;s Government and ipso facto to give him doubts about the wisdom of holding his reserves in sterling.11. Despite the fairly favourable picture of the present situation painted bythe Political Resident it would be dangerously complacent to assume that theposition can be maintained indefinitely. The Political Resident has argued that pressure for change in the Persian Gulf is largely external. This may be generallytrue in the case of the Trucial States and Muscat: so long as oil is not found,society remains primitive and the majority of the people illiterate. But the TrucialStates at least cannot be insulated from outside influence. There are already signsof growing political awareness among certain sections of the population particularlyin the towns; schoolchildren are coming under the influence of Palestinian and egyptian teachers (who are often the only teachers available) while the whole population is subject to the influence of anti-Western Arab Nationalist propagandafrom Cairo Radio.12. In the other States there is much more internal pressure for changebecause prosperity and economic development resulting from discovery of oil have brought widespread education, facilitated the spread of foreign influence throughthe media of the press, the radio, and through foreigners particularly from egypt and Palestine and allowed Arabs from the Persian Gulf States to travel abroad.Although at present political activity may have been scotched by the authoritiesin Bahrain, be under strict supervision in Kuwait and lack cohesion in Qatar, itis inconceivable that.this situation should continue indefinitely. Sooner or later the demand for reform will become sufficiently strong and insistent to compelsome change in the present patriarchal system of government. Much will dependon whether the Ruling families have the courage and wisdom to come to terms with moderate opinion in their States and thus prevent the potential forces of opposition from mobilising sufficient strength to be able to overthrow their regimesunless they are saved by outside, i.e., British help which it might be difficult forus to give. The Political Resident has shown that such a situation might arise in kuwait (paragraph 3 of Bahrain despatch No. 12). It is impossible to predictin what way the Persian Gulf States will develop, but it is fairly certain that inthe oil-bearing States at least there may come a time in the foreseeable futurewhen the Rulers will be forced to adjust their relations with this country in orderto survive. We should be prepared to accept such an adjustment if to do so seemsthe best way to preserve our access to Persian Gulf oil.Dangers of Initiating any Change13. Our position in the Persian Gulf is probably the one remaining vitalasset in the Middle East which we can at least come within measurable distance of protecting on our own. As long as this remains so any change in our relationship with the Persian Gulf States should only be made if it would improve our positionor if our position could not be maintained without it, and not for the benefit of relations with neighbouring independent States, e.g., Iran and Iraq. Sir BernardBurrows considers, and I agree, that federation would be impracticable in the fore-seeable future. Although our interests in the Gulf might be assisted by associatingthe Persian Gulf States with the Bagdad Pact if this were.possible, an attempt todo so would carry the danger of a drastic political realignment which would notbe to our advantage, and it is not certain that this danger would be averted evenif we had the fullest United States support. The danger would be even greaterif Saudi Arabia (whose interests at least in respect of the Arabian Peninsula arestill allied to those of Egypt and the Yemen) was also included among the proposedlegatees of British responsibility (Tehran despatch No. 37). Far from restrainingeach other Iran and Saudi Arabia might well combine against Her Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s interest. Even if the interests of the Persian Gulf States could be guaranteed in some way, it would still,be doubtful whether an arrangement onthe lines contemplated in paragraph 7 (b) above would be acceptable either to the
protected or to the protectors. The Trucial States and Bahrain would hardlywelcome Saudi Arabia and Iran respectively as protectors under any circumstances.Saudi Arabia and Iran themselves might be unwilling to accept new responsibilities which they might consider would hamper their future ambitions.14. H.M. Ambassadors at Tehran and Bagdad base their arguments partly on the assumption that the maintenance of our position in the Persian Gulf depends on securing the agreement of the three major littoral Powers. But in fact for theimmediate future stability in the Persian Gulf may depend not so much on this as upon the maintenance of the present delicate balance of forces. If that wereto be disturbed by an attempt to carry out any of the proposals discussed abovethe consequences might well be as Her Majesty&apos;s Political Resident predicted inparagraph 8 (c) above. In addition the Trucial States and Central Oman would almost certainly be swallowed up by Saudi Arabia.Annex 2THE PERSIAN GULFA. The Nature of the United Kingdom&apos;s position the States of the Persian Gulf Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the seven Trucial .Shaikhdoms (of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm-al-Quaw^m^Ras-al-Khaimah and Fujairah) differ in wealth, in degree of advancement, andin political characteristics; but the United Kingdom Governments constitutionalrelationship with them all is broadly the same. They are independent ArabShaikhdoms, under United Kingdom protection, and linked to the United KingdomGovernment by a number of treaties and undertakings given at various times since1820 by and to their Rulers. The principal rights and responsibilities which make up the United Kingdom&apos;s special position are:  (a) DefenceAssurances have been given to the Rulers of Bahrain and Qatarthat the United Kingdom will protect them against external aggression.There is no specific obligation towards Kuwait or the Trucial States,though this obligation could be said to be implicit in the fact that these states are recognised to be under United Kingdom protection.(b) The exclusive agreements with the Rulers whereby they have undertakennot to communicate with foreign Governments except through theUnited Kingdom Government. On the basis of these agreements broadly the same for all the States the United Kingdom conductstheir foreign relations for them.(c) Extra-territorial jurisdiction, which is exercised by agreement with the rulers. This varies from State to State. In general it covers Britishsubjects and most foreign nationals except Arabs, but it is much widerin the Trucial States.(d) Oil agreements the Rulers have undertaken not to grant oil concessions withoutthe United Kingdom Governments approval. On the strength of these agreements the United Kingdom Government regard as subject to their approval the terms of oil agreements concluded by the Rulers. TheUnited Kingdom also concludes Political Agreements with the oil companies concerned, which provide inter alia that the companies shallconduct their relations with the Rulers on policy matters through theUnited Kingdom Political Agents.(e) AviationBy special Air Navigation Agreements with each State having an airfield the United Kingdom Government have (a) control over trafficrights; (b) facilities for the R.A.F.; and (c), in Bahrain and Sharjah only,responsibility for the operation of the airfield.
(/) Other agreements with the Rulers provide for the prohibition of the import of arms and of the slave trade, and the operation of postal services bythe General Post Office.2. Except in one or two specific matters, such as arms and slavery, theUnited Kingdom Government have no right to intervene in the internal affairs ofthe States and can influence them only (a) by proffering advice.  The Political Agent in each territory sees the Rulerfrequently, and this access is an important part of the United Kingdom&apos;position; and(b) through the British Advisers and employees of the Rulers.   (In Bahrainand Qatar, but not in Kuwait, the Administrations are headed byAdvisers from the United Kingdom. In all three States numbers of officials and experts from the United Kingdom are employed.)The United Kingdom Governmenfs capacity to direct the internal Governmentsof the States is thus strictly limited. The United Kingdom can impose its wishesin internal matters only if it is prepared to resort to force. In that the territories are British Protected States (they are so designated by Order in Council) the UnitedKingdom is liable to be held generally responsible before world opinion for all thatgoes on in them. In a sense, the United Kingdom position is thus one ofresponsibility without authority. Moreover, military intervention by the UnitedKingdom, even at the request of the Ruler in order to assist him in restoring lawand order, is liable to involve continuing commitments of an internal character.Intervention against the Ruler and in support of reform would probably involvethe installation of a new Ruler and the establishment of his authority under UnitedKingdom control. This would create very great difficulties for the United Kingdomthroughout the Arab world, and it would give a further propaganda handle tohostile outside influences.B.
