introduction. We were, appointed on 15th February, 1957, with the following terms ofreference:  &quot; To consider what part the United Kingdom and other independent members of the Commonwealth should play in the economic development ofthe Commonwealth, particularly of countries which have recently attainedindependence, with special reference to the provision of capital and of technical assistance; and to recommend any facilities needed for such development.&quot;The Committee comprised the Minister of State for Colonial affairs*irs (in the chair), the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations,and representatives of the Treasury, the Commonwealth Relations Office, theColonial Office and the Board of Trade.2. The Committee had its origin in issues which arose from the grant of independence to Ghana and the promise of independence to the Federation of malaya, and we have given particular attention to these two countries. We have,however, taken account of the probable effects upon other countries approachingindependence such as Nigeria, the Caribbean Federation, the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland, and indeed elsewhere throughout the Commonwealth,*of special measures to meet the needs of Ghana and Malaya.3. The report falls into two parts, dealing with the provision of capital onthe one hand and the provision of technical assistance on the other. The formerinevitably touches on wide questions of economic and financial policy, whereas thelatter is primarily concerned with the availability of scientific and technologicalman-power facilities. In practice there will be a measure of overlap between thetwo.   We have dealt first with the provision of capital.ii summary OF REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS ONPROVISION OF CAPITAL4. The main issue on which the Committee had to make up their minds beforeformulating any recommendations was whether Her Majesty&apos;s Government should provide capital to the Governments of independent Commonwealth countries asa regular feature of Government policy, and should encourage other independent commonwealth Governments to do likewise. This would mean that the bulk ofthe capital would have to be provided by the United Kingdom Government tothe other Governments in the Commonwealth, as the rest of the Commonwealthare all net capital importers.5. We decided against Government-to-Government help as a regular pattern,while recognising that there might be circumstances, particularly in newly-independent countries, demanding exceptions to the rule. These would be dealtwith on their merits. We do not, therefore, advocate the setting up of any new body or the extension of the functions of an existing one, for the distribution ofUnited Kingdom Exchequer funds to independent countries of the commonwealth in the shape of capital for development. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations has advanced somewhat different views on thisquestion, and these are set out immediately after the summary of our recommendations in paragraph 17.6. This rule should not apply to the Colonial territories in view of the special responsibilities towards them of the United Kingdom.   A substantial share of the* The term &quot; Commonwealth &quot; is used throughout the report to cover both the independent members of the Commonwealth and dependent overseas territories Where it is necessary to distinguish between the two. the terms &quot; independent Commonwealth &quot; and &quot; Colonies &quot; are used.
external capital finance required for Colonial development has to come fromExchequer sources, and we note that the difficulties which Colonial governments have found in raising the balance of the external loans required on the london market has led the Colonial Secretary to submit proposals for a systemof supplementary Exchequer loans.7. The following are the main reasons why a system of Government-to-Government financial aid to independent countries should not become a regularfeature of Government policy:  (i) It would be exceedingly difficult for the United Kingdom to confine suchaid within any practicable limits, or to differentiate between oneCommonwealth country and another.(ii) Government loans tend to import political complications into what shouldideally be a purely financial transaction.(iii) Prolonged dependence by one Government on another must seriouslydamage the formers credit standing and make more difficult the raising of funds from more normal sources.(iv) Certain newly-independent countries have sterling balances part of whichare available for development. The granting of further government loans will in the short term merely increase the United Kingdom&apos;ssterling liabilities at a time when efforts elsewhere are being made tobring our liabilities and assets into better balance.8. Save in the case of the Colonies, the great part which the United kingdom has played to date in the development of the Commonwealth has not involveddirect Government-to-Government loans (except under Section 3 of the txportGuarantees Acts, 1949-1952). The rate of investment has latterly been at the rateof  125- 150 millions a year, and we feel that this achievement should be more widely publicised, perhaps by means of a White Paper. Whether or not in presentcircumstances this rate of investment can be maintained or increased depends uponissues of over-all economic policy which were not for the Committee to determine.Clearly the more we can assist Commonwealth development the stronger will bethe ties which bind the Commonwealth together.9. We have considered the possibility of a Commonwealth-wide scheme forthe provision of capital on a joint basis and the co-ordination of economic development. The replies of the independent Commonwealth countries to thesuggestion of a Commonwealth Bank have been discouraging. This reinforcesthe arguments developed above against any regular system of United kingdom excequer assistance to independent Commonwealth countries, because it is clearthat the whole weight of such a system would fall on the United Kingdom. nor have these countries favoured the idea of a Commonwealth Development Agencyconcerned with the settling of priorities and the co-ordination of economic andfinancial policies. But this does not exclude the possibility of strengthening themachinery which already exists for consultation between commonwealth governments on economic affairs, and we consider in our report on technical assistance whether it might be possible further to develop this machinery to provide a specifically Commonwealth channel for the provision of experteconomic advice to the Governments of newly independent Commonwealthterritories in the framing and execution of their development plans and projects.10. We think therefore, while recognising Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentsspecial responsibilities to the Colonies, that it is primarily to private enterprise and finance that Commonwealth countries seeking capital for their economic development should ordinarily turn. We have been concerned to see how theresources of the City and of industry in this country, in co-operation with local interests, could be stimulated to forward the economic development of theCommonwealth. One measure to this end has lately been taken which shouldbe of real help to the Commonwealth: tax reliefs for the purpose of encouragingprivate investment overseas. We have two further suggestions to make inparagraphs 11 and 12 below.11. Local development corporations able to help in starting new industry inthe countries concerned by subscribing towards their capital requirements, appearspecially suitable for those nations which as yet have not a highly developed capitalmarket.  Such corporations have been set up in various Commonwealth countries
which have become independent since the war, their equity capital coming mainly from private sources both local and United Kingdom, though the international bank for Reconstruction and Development (I.B.R.D.) has assisted in certain cases.We hope that the City and industry in this country can be stimulated to foster the growth of such organisations, both through further financial participation as appropriate and by providing personnel with financial and other expert knowledge:we have particularly in mind the Commonwealth.Development Finance Company(C.D.F.C.) as a suitable means to these ends. It is desirable that foreign capital alsoshould be attracted into local development corporations, or into other ventures in commonwealth countries in which British interests have taken part: it is most likely to be attracted if it is associated with United Kingdom interests which havenot only long experience and expert knowledge of Commonwealth investment,but which also share any financial risk.12. We believe that the Commonwealth Development Finance Company,which has already taken a leading part in getting several local develop-ment corporations started, is in many ways an ideal instrument for harnessingthe capital and expertise of United Kingdom private enterprise to the needs of commonwealth economic development. The Company is, however, within sight of the limit of the resources at present available to it. We think it most important that the Company should be enabled not only to maintain, but if possible to expandits activities. In our view a doubling of the rate of the Company&apos;s investment would not be in the least excessive in relation to the need. We recognise that the precise way in which the Company should increase its resources is a matter forthe Company itself to determine, but we recommend that the Board of theCompany should be informed of the importance which Her Majesty&apos;s government attach to its work, and that the Treasury, in consultation with the Bank of England,should consider what practical help could be given to the Company in meetingits present problem. We also believe that there would be considerable advantage in associating with the Company private, commercial and industrial interests fromother parts of the Commonwealth. Enlargement of its capital through systematicparticipation by all members of the Commonwealth is probably neither practicablenor desirable. We are, however, glad to learn that the C.D.F.C. is itself exploringenergetically the raising of capital from selected private interests of other commonwealth countries. In general we should like to see the Company placedon a comparable footing with that of the Finance Corporation for Industry, whichfunctions in a somewhat similar field in the United Kingdom and which has an authorised capita! of  25 millions and borrowing powers up to  100 millions.13. We have considered the possible role of the Colonial development corporation (C.D.C.) in independent Commonwealth countries. Since the Corpora-tion operates with Government capital, it does not seem appropriate for the reasonsset out in paragraph 7 that it should operate in the independent countries of theCommonwealth. The root objection to any such extension of the Corporation^powers is the undesirability of allowing a quasi-autonomous body such as this,operating on commercial criteria, to decide how and when United KingdomGovernment funds should be invested in independent countries. The decision insuch cases should be one for Ministers, subject to Parliamentary authority. should Commonwealth Government, however, wish to engage any member of theCorporation^ staff or to ask the C.D.C. to undertake a management agency(without commitment of its funds) for any particular projects, this would seem tobe an activity which should readily be permitted.14. There will, in any case, remain a most important and valuable role forthe C.D.C. in the dependent territories, and we should support an increase in theirborrowing powers for this purpose. If, however, the proposals now being made bythe Colonial Secretary for alternative sources of loan finance for colonial governments are accepted, we do not think that ordinarily the C.D.C. shouldcontinue to make loans to Colonial Governments or statutory bodies.15. We do, however, recognise that, despite our general recommendation,there may exceptionally be reason for direct Government assistance to a newly-independent nation of the Commonwealth to supplement the capital flow whichit is to be hoped will find its way through the normal private channels and theC.D.F.C. In the event this assistance would be likely to be for reasons other thanthe ordinary commercial ones and might be advanced on strategic or political
grounds. The Committee did not feel that it was appropriate for them torecommend what form such aid should take: this would be determined in the lightof the special circumstances. They consider it sufficient to record their view thatthere may be occasions (as indeed there have already been), when the UnitedKingdom Government may need to make available such special financial help,particularly for newly-independent Commonwealth countries.16. The Treaty of Rome envisages that governmental assistance should bemade available to the &quot; overseas territories &quot; of the participants, to a total of some$580 millions in the first five years. The exact geographical scope of this schemeis not entirely clear, but in so far as it relates primarily (and possibly exclusively)to dependent overseas territories it runs parallel with our recommendations. Itcan hardly fail to make more remote any possibility of capital from european governments being available for Commonwealth development. There should,however, still be some European private capital available for this development.17. We make the following main recommendations. (Minorrecommendations have been left in the body of the report, where they are markedwith an asterisk):  (a) Ordinarily, capital for economic development should not be provided ona Government-to-Government basis to the independent Commonwealth(paragraph 57).(b) From time to time special circumstances may well arise necessitatingGovernment-to-Government aid; its form should be decided in lightof such circumstances (paragraphs 74-77).(c) The   United   Kingdom   should,   where   appropriate,   stimulate   theestablishment and expansion of development and finance corporations in the newer independent countries of the Commonwealth, whetherthrough the C.D.F.C. or through other companies with large local interests (paragraph 22).(d) The C.D.F.C., for the purpose outlined in (c) above and generally, shouldbe informed of the importance Her Majesty&apos;s Government attach to theexpansion of their activities. The Treasury and the Bank of england should consider what practical help can be given to the Company tothis end (paragraph 53).(e) The C.D.C. should continue to assist Colonial territories in the developmentof commercial projects but, if the proposals by the Colonial Secretaryfor Exchequer loans to Colonial Governments (see paragraph 72) are approved, it should not make loans to Governments or to Government-controlled corporations. It should not embark on new schemes for independent territories, but it should not be debarred from secondingindividual members of its staff to aisist in managing new development projects in newly-independent countries, or from acting on a management agency footing, if so requested by the Government of thecountry concerned (paragraphs 65-73).Note by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for commonwealth relations am fully seized of the importance of the arguments (set out above) againstspecific large-scale commitments in respect of Government-to-Government finance for the independent Commonwealth. I believe, however, that the approach to a united Kingdom Commonwealth economic policy, as indicated in paragraphs 74to 77 of the Committee&apos;s main report, pays.insufficient attention to the necessity forthis type of investment where newly-independent countries in underdevelopedareas are concerned. It also appears to me to underestimate the political importance, both here and overseas, of a more definite approach to these problems.My principal reasons for this view are as follows.Major projects of primary development (particularly water control,communications and power supply) are likely in the future as in the past to beundertaken by Governments. Without such major projects profitable secondarydevelopment will be unlikely to take place. Governments which are willing togrant loans for such purposes will not only ensure that their own heavyconstructional and engineering industries will have a share in such development,
but also that their secondary industries will be well placed to take profitableadvantage of the phase of secondary development which will follow.Governments of newly-independent countries will not easily be able to obtainmoney in the London money market at a time when their political stability isunproved and their need for development capital most urgent. On independencethey will cease to have access to Colonial Development and Welfare funds, theC.D.C. or any money provided under Colonial loans legislation. Great advantagecan come to the United Kingdom, both politically and financially, by providingassistance at an inevitably critical juncture.Territories moving from colonial to independent status are for the most partaccustomed to the Government playing a major part in various forms ofdevelopment. They are most likely to possess Left-wing Governments. these will be suspicious of private finance and will feel themselves in sympathy withthose other Governments willing to cater for their prejudices. The refusal of theUnited - Kingdom to undertake Government-to-Government finance for development will tend to weaken ties with the United Kingdom and throw them into the arms of foreign countries to our great hurt and disadvantage.While I do not recommend the setting aside of any special sum of money for the provision of development finance on a Government-to-Government basis and while I accept the importance of maintaining the maximum flexibility indealing with such demands as may be made upon us, I propose that (i) The&apos; United Kingdom Government should make it clear that, in so faras available resources permit, they are prepared to considersupporting bilateral technical aid agreements with newly-independent commonwealth countries either by means of loans on a Government-to-Government basis or by the provision on appropriate terms ofcertain categories of capital equipment. Such support would be forthcoming for primary development projects and would not beavailable for development which could be better financed through theLondon money market, by locally controlled resources or by private investment. The period during which this form of investment would beavailable from the United Kingdom would be limited to the life ofeach technical aid programme. The limit of total liability could be defined in the agreement, if this were thought necessary.(ii) Other Commonwealth Governments should be encouraged both to enterinto bilateral technical aid agreements with newly-independent commonwealth countries and to back them financially on whateverterms may be considered appropriate by their respective Governments.(hi) The above proposals would not extend to countries already covered bythe Colombo Plan. In their case, United Kingdom government finance would be provided, as at present, through the Export credits guarantee Department or by the release of our sterling subscriptionto the International Bank.(iv) In order to prevent overlapping and to ensure as widely beneficial adistribution of technical and financial aid as is possible, fellow membersof the Commonwealth entering into the agreements referred to above should be invited to inform all other Commonwealth governments and to notify the Commonwealth Economic Committee, assuming thatthis body is given certain additional responsibilities for theco-ordination and distribution of economic information for theCommonwealth.IllPROVISION OF CAPITALA. Future Commonwealth Development Plans and Demand for Capital18. All Commonwealth countries are keenly interested in promoting theirown economic development and are devoting a considerable proportion of their resources to this purpose. At the Commonwealth Economic Conference, inDecember 1952, Governments agreed that within the sterling commonwealth development should be concentrated on projects which directly or indirectly
contributed to the improvement of the area&apos;s balance of payments with the restof the world. It was recognised, however, that in some countries development plans were also being made to provide for some basic improvement in the standards of living (which is a necessary foundation for further economic development) andthat in the more developed countries, certain of which had rapidly increasingpopulations, some social investment was also urgently needed. During the last few years a number of Commonwealth Governments have introduced development plans on these lines, each calling for an ambitious programme of capital investmentover a period of several years. The table below gives an indication of the magnitude of this demand in the near future (1955-60 except where otherwise shown):   millionsCD. &amp; W.

The figures quoted are in some cases highly speculative and in the caseof India are particularly unlikely to be fulfilled. They are based where possible on any analysis of the current development plans of Commonwealth governments and Government sponsored bodies, and in cases where no agreed plan exists, ona projection of the existing rate of development expenditure. We thought itnecessary, however, to attempt some estimate of the Commonwealth as a wholein order to put the capital situation in some sort of perspective.B. Sources of Capital other than the United KingdomLocal Sources of Capital20. It will be seen from the above analysis that (apart from some of thesmaller Colonies) most Commonwealth Governments are already able to find fromtheir own resources the bulk of the finance needed for their development; and forthe independent Commonwealth countries at least, overseas borrowing is marginalalthough important.21. Local finance for development purposes can be found from direct taxrevenue, by loans to the Government from certain local sources such as thesurpluses of marketing boards, by loans from currency funds or by the issue of stock to the public locally. The latter method is largely dependent on the existenceof a capital market; it is for instance, an important source of capital for the olderCommonwealth countries, but those countries which, like the Colonies, have nodeveloped capital market cannot mobilise finance in this way with any ease. Thedevelopment of this source of finance will involve a slow process of education,partly by encouraging habits of thrift among the population and partly by improving the techniques for making use of these habits once formed. It will,however, bring great benefits in the long-term to the Commonwealth as a whole,and it must remain an object of our policy to provide the necessary advice and* Recommendations which are not included in the summary of recommendations (paragraph 17above) are indicated by an asterisk.
technical assistance to foster this process. Considerable thought has in fact beengiven to this problem in the last three years in relation to the more importantColonial territories: certain steps have been taken, and others are planned,designed to foster the growth of local capital markets.22. To help mobilise local resources, development and finance corporationsof various types have been established in Commonwealth countries in the past tenyears. Some have specialised on a particular product or area, while others havegeneral developments powers. Properly organised and efficiently controlled, thesecorporations can provide a valuable means of promoting development, particularlyin territories where there is no local capital market and local enterprise is lacking.Most of them are statutory bodies publicly financed, but some of these work in association with private interests oh particular enterprises and this is clearly desirable. There are at present no local private development corporations in theColonial territories, but Barclays Overseas Development Corporation, and theStandard Bank Finance and Development Corporation both, of course, operate in the Colonies. In addition, a new Industrial Development Finance corporation is to be set up in the Federation of Malaya which it is hoped will have an equity capital subscribed by the Government, the Colonial Development Corporation,banking houses, insurance companies and the general public; and privatedevelopment finance corporations, designed to fill part of the gap between theneeds of the local private industries and the investor, have already been established in India and in Ceylon, and a similar institution is proposed for Pakistan.Assistance has been given by the International Bank and United Kingdom interests have taken up, through the medium of the Commonwealth Development FinanceCompany between one-fifth and two-fifths of the share capital. We thinkit important that the United Kingdom should so far as possible take theinitiative in stimulating the establishment of similar private corporations where appropriate. The C.D.F.C. is well placed to do this both by subscribing itself andby encouraging other United Kingdom interests to do so. It is desirable that foreign capital also should be attracted into local development corporations, orinto other ventures in Commonwealth countries in which British interests havetaken part; it is most likely to be attracted if it is associated with the UnitedKingdom interests which have not only expert knowledge but which also share any financial risk.23. Since the war most Commonwealth countries have been holdingsubstantial reserves of sterling. These reserves are already being heavily drawn upon by the countries which have achieved independence since 1945, and this process may well continue until these reserves have reached minimum workinglevels. The immediate effect upon the economy of the United Kingdom is thesame whether a particular demand upon its goods and services is financed from existing overseas sterling balances or from a new sterling loan. But at a time whenthe United Kingdom is seeking to improve its overseas assets and liabilities position there are obvious advantages in encouraging Commonwealth countries to use theirexisting reserves of sterling before seeking further loans. There are limitations onthe extent to which Colonial Governments can run down their sterling balances in order to finance their development programmes, although they are being usedto the greatest possible extent for this purpose in the current development period.Borrowing Outside the Sterling Area24. Since the war, and more specifically since 1949, non-sterling sources have provided capital for Commonwealth Government and private sectors amountingto at least  600 millions. Very roughly this is about half of the estimated netcapital total put out since 1949 by the United Kingdom. The bulk of these non-sterling loans have been from official sources to official borrowers. The international bank has been the most fruitful source, largely for the benefit of independent countries of the Commonwealth, and it has been the United Kingdom&apos;s deliberatepolicy in the light of our straitened resources for overseas investment to promotethis international means of fostering development within the Commonwealth, inparticular by releasing part of our sterling subscription to the I.B.R.D. (seeparagraph 58). The only other major source has been the United States (mainly the Government, which has also made grants and the bulk of whose assistance has gone to India and Pakistan), but Canada, Switzerland and Holland have also madeuseful contributions.
25. The prospects and desirability of increased borrowing by commonwealth countries in the non-sterling area are the subject of a separate study being madefor the Economic Policy Committee by the Treasury, and we have done no morethan briefly survey this field. It is recognised that, apart from the mainconsideration of availability of funds, there are other problems, such as the costto the sterling area, the possibility of trade following lending, the tying of loans and the question of exchange guarantees. Furthermore, efforts to make fuller useof these sources for the Colonies would raise in difficult form the question of guarantees by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.26. Some sterling area countries (e.g., India) can be expected to borrowfurther large sums from the I.B.R.D., and further United States Government loans and grant assistance can reasonably be expected, primarily for the independent commonwealth countries of Asia. It does not seem likely, however, that the totalamounts available to the Commonwealth as a whole from outside the sterling area will go up in the future. The principal difficulties with the New York marketare that (with the exception of Australia) the sterling Commonwealth countriestrying to borrow there would have no established credit standing, and thatinvestment at home or in American concerns operating abroad is much more attractive for the American private lender. Some useful but not striking sumswill, however, probably come from this source over the years. Following theAustralian borrowing precedent of 1955, occasional and modest scope is offered tothe right Commonwealth borrower by the Canadian market. Again, opportunitiesas in the past may occur in Switzerland and possibly in Holland, and Germanindustrial and trade interests may be attracted to some investment in theCommonwealth though the development of Germany as a source of private loans for Governments is obstructed by the absence of a capital market. But, while theremay thus be some scope for investment of private capital from European countries,it seems probable that the obligations which European Governments have nowassumed under the Treaty of Rome will make still more remote any possibilityof governmental investment in Commonwealth development. The Treaty providesfor investment in the overseas territories of the participants to the tune of some$580 millions in the first five years. Of this Germany is to provide $200 millions,and $510 millions of the total would go to the French overseas territories.27. In sum, therefore, no significant sources in the non-sterling field remainuntapped and, while taken as a whole, it is likely to continue to provide asubstantial reinforcement to the United Kingdom&apos;s own lending, as in the past, itsofferings are likely to be unevenly directed and the average total level over a period is not likely to rise.28. &quot; Colombo Plan &quot; for Africa. We have been informed of the inter-departmental study which is being made of the possibility of a scheme for international assistance to the African territories south of the Sahara on the &quot;linesof the Colombo Plan. It is not for us to enter into the merits or disadvantages of such a scheme. We doubt, however, whether it would have any significant effort on the flow of capital to the British territories in the area: its mainpotentialities would appear to lie in the field of technical assistance and will therefore be dealt with in the Committee^ report on that subject.Other Commonwealth Countries29. We have also examined the sources of finance in other commonwealth countries, whether this be borrowing from other Commonwealth Governments orfrom private enterprise in those countries. The main impediment here is thatall Commonwealth Governments, with the exception of the United Kingdom, arenet importers of capital. Nevertheless Canada, Australia and New Zealand givecapital assistance on a grant basis to Colombo Plan countries in Asia and canada is considering giving help in some form to the Caribbean Federation. Werecommend that any opportunities should be taken to encourage the Governmentsof the more developed Commonwealth countries to give loans or grants to theirless developed Commonwealth partners on however modest a scale, as this typeof Commonwealth co-operation can have a considerable political effect inemphasising to the economically weaker members of the Commonwealth theadvantages of the Commonwealth connection, and in discouraging any tendenciesthey may develop to seek aid from undesirable sources.   But-we shall need to be
10cautious in any approaches to other Commonwealth Governments in this matterand a general approach, as has been shown recently, would be unlikely to achieveany useful result.30. Private interests in other Commonwealth countries will be ready to lendsums to finance development in newly independent territories with which theymay be identified either by geographical proximity or by self-interest. Thoughthe extent of such investment is not likely to be large no opportunity should be lost to encourage such participation.31. Commonwealth Development Agency and Commonwealth Bank. Theprobable lack of capital for export from other Commonwealth Governments andthe present stage of political development within the Commonwealth seem to usto preclude the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank and a commonwealth development Agency, proposals for which have been canvassed from time to timein the past and were revived in fairly precise form last December during the courseof a Parliamentary debate on Commonwealth development. It was then suggestedthat there should be a Commonwealth Bank with a membership of all theCommonwealth countries and with capital subscribed by them, whose purpose would be to invest in development projects throughout the Commonwealth andparticularly in those which provided for basic services. Associated with this body would be a Development Agency, again with membership drawn from all Common-wealth countries, concerned with the collection and dissemination of information about development potentialities and needs within the Commonwealth and withthe carrying out of surveys of all kinds and with the determining of priorities.&apos; 32. These proposals have been conveyed to independent commonwealth governments by the Commonwealth Secretary, who pointed out that, howeversound the motives underlying them, they were open serious objections. the mere creation of additional banking machinery would not of itself create new capital, particularly if membership were confined to the Commonwealth, with the consequent exclusion of the United States and other capital exporting countries;and in so far as a Development Agency or other machinery for economic co-operation was concerned to co-ordinate economic and financial policies and establish priorities for investment, it would involve a degree of surrender of nationalsovereignty which no Commonwealth Government would be likely to accept.33. We consider that the objections to these proposals are well founded,and it is clear from the reactions of the Commonwealth Governments (which are summarised in the Appendix to this report) that this view is shared by them ?lso.There may, however, be a case for strengthening the machinery which already exists for the inter-change of information between Commonwealth governments on economic affairs, and we consider this subject further in our report on technical assistance, with special reference to the framing and execution of development plans and projects.C. The United Kingdom as a Source of CapitalCurrent Policy34. United Kingdom Government policy on the provision of finance for commonwealth development was laid down at the Commonwealth EconomicConference in December 1952 and the Commonwealth Finance Ministers&apos;Conference in January 1954. At the first of these Conferences, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment recorded their determination to maintain and increase the flow ofUnited Kingdom capital for Commonwealth development (provided the necessarylevel of home savings and surplus on overseas account could be achieved). they also undertook to make a special effort to provide additional capital for schemes which would improve the sterling area&apos;s balance of payments, provided that thecountry concerned was itself devoting an adequate part of its own resources both to this kind of investment in general, and to the particular scheme concerned.At the second Conference, this policy was elaborated to include borrowing by commonwealth Governments for general development programmes as well asparticular projects, subject to the same criteria as to improvement of the sterling area&apos;s balance of payments and an adequate local contribution.
Extent of United Kingdom Contribution35. Total private investment in the sterling Commonwealth, whether throughthe London market, the C.D.F.C., or investment by United Kingdom firms, can beroughly estimated on balance-of-payments figures at over  100 millions a year netin 1952-54, falling to something under this for 1955 and 1956. About one-half ofthis has been for the Colonies, but only a small part for Malaya and the Gold Coast.36. Total United Kingdom Government investment, whether under theColonial Development and Welfare Acts or Section 3 of the Export GuaranteesActs, 1949-52, or through the operations of the C.D.C., or in the form ofInternational Bank sterling releases, has been:    millionsIndependentColonies      Commonwealth      Total1954-55   ............      ... 20 7 271955-56   ......      ......... 25 5 301956-57 (estimated)     ......... 27 10 37 .37. The total United Kingdom contribution to development in the sterling commonwealth is somewhere between  125 and  150 millions a year. This figurecan be no more than a rough indication of the order of magnitude, since itis produced by adding gross total Government expenditure in fiscal years to netestimated private capital outflow in calendar years.38. Any precise comparison of the United Kingdom contribution with thatof other countries is impossible, since these countries do not necessarily make money available in the same way, or through the same channels, or to a similar group of countries. An exercise has recently been undertaken in the O.E.E.C. to measure the economic aid of all kinds given by member countries to under-developed countries from 1952 to 1955. This includes current economic aid and thereforerepresents a wider area of assistance than that covered above, and relates to a group of recipient countries entirely consisting of under-developed countries with a lowstandard of living. But it provides some indication of comparable effort. allowing for differences in the basis of the national figures, and excluding contributions made through multilateral schemes, the United Kingdom is in the lead with 0 - 8 per cent,of its gross national product; then the Netherlands with 0-6 per cent., Belgium andthe United States with 0-4 per cent., Germany and Canada with 0-2 per cent, andItaly with 0-1 per cent. (No comparable figure can be quoted for France, v/hichhas not disclosed figures for private investment in its own overseas territories.)39. The extent to which the United Kingdom has invested in theCommonwealth since the Commonwealth Economic Conference in 1952, despite the heavy calls on its resources entailed by other overseas commitments, isimpressive, but is not generally known or at least not fully appreciated, though theinformation set out above is nearly all available to the public in various Governmentpublications. We therefore recommend that consideration be given to publicisingthrough a White Paper the contribution which the United Kingdom has made to commonwealth economic development since 1952.Future Policy40. The survey of other sources of capital finance, whether from within or outside the Commonwealth, made in earlier sections of this report shows that theUnited Kingdom is likely to remain the largest single source of external capital for the Commonwealth as a whole. The future scale of United Kingdom overseainvestment, together with other major issues of sterling area policy, is now beingconsidered by the Economic Policy Committee and we have not thought it properto attempt any recommendation on this subject. Should it, however, be decidedthat the general level of United Kingdom overseas commitments should be reducedwe believe that not only are there strong arguments for maintaining the present level of United Kingdom investment in the Commonwealth but that there is acase for encouraging its increase, even at the cost of diverting to this purpose a portion of the resources which might be freed as our other commitments overseasare reduced.41.   We advance this view both on economic and political grounds.   In thefirst place, we have our special responsibilities to the Colonies.   Secondly, UnitedKingdom investment in the Commonwealth is of direct assistance to mutual trade,516.12 C 2
on which the maintenance of Commonwealth ties very largely depends in thelong run. Any reduction in this investment would be particularly inopportune ata time when the United Kingdom initiative towards a closer economic association with Europe might encourage the misconception that this implies some weakeningin the value which we place on these ties. Moreover, to &quot;the extent to which commonwealth countries are increasingly driven to meet at least some part oftheir external capital requirements from sources other than the United Kingdomthe risk will be increased of undue commercial, and hence political, penetrationby other countries, which could weaken Commonwealth ties. Included in suchrisks is that of commercial penetration by the Soviet bloc, which is clearly to be avoided if possible.42. We now turn to consider the means whereby whatever level of capital investment in the Commonwealth may be practicable for the United Kingdomcan be effected. In the following paragraphs we review firstly, the machinery for private investment in the Commonwealth i.e., the London market, the C.D.F.C.,and investment by United Kingdom firms and secondly, the machinery for the investment of Government funds i.e., the release of sterling to the international bank, special governmental credits under the Export Guarantees Acts, and theColonial Development Corporation.43. At one end of the scale direct investment by private United Kingdomenterprises in the Commonwealth is of much greater benefit to the United Kingdomthan the lending of either United Kingdom Government money or private investors&apos;money to Commonwealth Governments at fixed rates of interest. All of theseinvolve an immediate charge on the United Kingdom balance of payments, butprivate investment in enterprises in other Commonwealth countries may bringsubstantial profit to the investor, and creates a permanent link between the UnitedKingdom economy and that of the Commonwealth country concerned of a sortlikely to encourage our exports, both visible and invisible. It may also develop&apos;the production of goods needed for import by the United Kingdom and may eventually lead to further United Kingdom private investment in the same project.All this is of great political value in cementing the Commonwealth link.44. At the other end of the scale loans out of United Kingdom Exchequerfunds are of value in easing our relations with another independent commonwealth government at an awkward moment or in helping us to secure export orders. Butthey place a direct burden on the Budget as well as on the balance of payments and create no permanent link. They are inevitably loans to Governments, since there will normally be resistance in independent Commonwealth countries to theidea of the United Kingdom Government acquiring, either directly or through a semi-autonomous corporation, an influence in the management of any sector ofthe economy of their country. The rate of interest would be fixed and when theloan is paid off the transaction is closed.Private United Kingdom Investment in the Commonwealth45. Government Loans on the London Market. Private United Kingdominvestment in the Commonwealth may take the form of investment inloans floated on the London market by Commonwealth Governments.Such loans have an advantage over direct Government-to-Governmentlending, since they minimise any political prejudice in the borrowingcountry and they are relatively free from any limitations on the uses towhich the funds can be put. They also have the advantage that theyentail a degree of economic discipline on the part of the borrowing country if it isto attract the necessary confidence. This last consideration reacts in turn to thebenefit of the private investment already at risk in the country concerned. Since1947 new loans totalling  257 millions have been raised in London by commonwealth Governments ( 107 millions by independent commonwealth governments, including the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and 150 millions by Colonial Governments). Of the latter only 30 per cent., however,represented new net investment by private investors in the United Kingdom; theother 70 per cent, was contributed from Colonial Government funds under themanagement of the Crown Agents. Tighter money conditions in London havenaturally affected the totals raised by Commonwealth Governments in the past two years  10 millions and  5 millions respectively compared with  20 millions and  25 millions in the preceding two years.   High interest rates taken with other
policies which together make up the credit squeeze and discourage the level of borrowing are, however, a part of deliberate United Kingdom Government policy,and we recognise the extreme difficulty of breaching this policy in order to benefitindependent Commonwealth Governments. These Governments, with the exceptionof India and Pakistan, but including Ghana, can all have trustee status for their stocks, and this can be retained for the stocks of the Governments of all colonies as they become independent, if they are willing to take the necessary legislative action. No more favourable standing can be accorded than this: there can clearly be no question of their borrowing being guaranteed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.This would be difficult to reconcile with their political independence, might seriously damage their credit-worthiness and might lead to pressure on us to guarantee borrowing by other independent Commonwealth Governments and colonies, with similar prejudice to their credit-worthiness.46. We recommend that all these facilities should continue to be extendedto independent Commonwealth Governments. Once conditions become easieron the London market, many of the problems in the way of financingCommonwealth development will be eased, though newly independent countries and the Colonial territories will continue to face competition from more attractiveborrowers. We have noted that Commonwealth subordinate authorities, suchas municipalities and public utilities are precluded from raising loans directly onthe London market, which is open to Commonwealth Governments only. we recognise that there are sound reasons for restricting access to the market, in theinterests of its effective management. But the present rules give rise to difficultcases; and we therefore recommend that the position should be kept under review by the Treasury.47. Private borrowing on the London war/ce/.-Borrowing on the london market by private interests in the Commonwealth is another useful and well-triedmethod of financing development. Such borrowing is subject to the approval ofthe Capital Issues Committee, which judges cases according to directions issuedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Even though the figures which follow relateto authorisations not all of which are taken up, they demonstrate the importanceof this field: consents have shown a steady increase from  38 milllions in 1953to  59 millions in 1956, notwithstanding the stiffer money conditions. Werecommend that there should be no change of policy in this field.48. The Commonwealth Development and Finance Company, Ltd. The C.D.F.C. was incorporated in March, 1953 to provide or procurefinancial facilities of ail kinds for the development of the resources of any part ofthe Commonwealth, primarily by helping to finance development undertaken by private enterprise, though financial participation in semi-government corporationsor other statutory bodies is not rigidly excluded. The Company works in close co-operation with the City finance houses to supplement what they are prepared to lend, or to invest in a project which can subsequently be placed with them. (it also keeps in contact with the C.D.C. to the extent necessary to ensure thatwould-be borrowers do not succeed in playing off one source of capital against another.) It does not seek to acquire a controlling interest in development projects,but rather to supplement the resources of other and larger investors where necessary.49. The Company&apos;s authorised share capital amounts to  15 millions ofwhich 45 per cent is held-by the Bank of England, the remainder being divided between some ninety industrial, mining and shipping companies and finance houses.The Company&apos;s borrowing powers amount to  30 millions, or twice their issuedcapital. Their commitments so far amount to about  13 millions. It was originally intended that the Company would be mainly financed by long-term borrowingin the London market, but in view of the rise in interest-rates it has continued to rely upon advances from the London Clearing Banks. These facilities at presentamount to  11 millions (the amount of the Company&apos;s uncalled capital) and havebeen drawn upon to the extent of nearly  4 - 9 millions: existing and proposedcommitments will eventually increase this to  8-5 millions.50. The Company&apos;s operations have not been confined to any one part ofthe Commonwealth, but have tended to be concentrated in the independent commonwealth countries (over  12 millions out of  13 millions). The Companyhas recently extended its activities to include the provision of advice to the newly-
independent Commonwealth countries and those which are nearing independence on certain aspects of their development potentialities. We welcome this development and, even if it is not in itself a profit-making activity, hope that theCompany will continue to pursue it. Consideration might be given to a specialGovernment contribution for the purpose, for instance out of Technical Assistancefunds.51. The C.D.F.C. seems to us in many ways to be an ideal instrument forfostering Commonwealth economic development, making use as it does both of thecapital and expertise of United Kingdom private enterprise: it could, we feel,continue to play a particularly valuable part in association with the localdevelopment organisations, to which reference has been made in paragraph 22.The scope of its activities is, however, necessarily limited by its available capital and we have therefore examined the possibility of a systematic enlargement of thisby securing the large-scale participation of Commonwealth Central Banks and commonwealth private enterprises.52. The ability of Commonwealth Central Banks to participate iscircumscribed. Only three could, of their own volition, subscribe to the C.D.F.C.;and, given the fact that all Commonwealth countries are net importers of capital,both the Governments and the Central Banks themselves would be reluctant tosee the inflow diminished by a long-term capital export. There would probably also be some unwillingness on the part of Commonwealth private enterprises to subscribe to the C.D.F.C. unless they could be convinced that it was in their ownbest interests to do so. Other difficulties would arise from any wholesale expansionof the Company. Subscription might lead to Commonwealth countries demandingthe right of representation on the Board; this would lead to unwieldiness, and therepresentatives of other Commonwealth countries might allow nationalconsiderations to influence what ought to be independent commercial judgment on the desirability of participating in individual projects. Moreover, an enlargement of the Company&apos;s capital base would not necessarily increase its chances of raisingloans abroad: a major obstacle in the way of non-sterling borrowing would bethe exchange risk. Neither the lender nor the C.D.F.C. would be prepared to carry the risk which would have to fall on the ultimate borrower, who might be equallyunwilling. We have, therefore, reached the conclusion that a systematic expansionby large scale Commonwealth participation is impracticable. We understand,however, that the C.D.F.C. itself would welcome the participation of selectedprivate interests in other Commonwealth countries, and is actively exploring thepossibilities.53. We are informed that the C.D.F.C. is now approaching the limit of theresources at present available to it. We think it most important that the company should be enabled not only to maintain, but if possible to expand, its activities, andin our view a doubling of the rate of the Company&apos;s investment would not be at allexcessive in relation to the need. We recognise that the precise way in which theCompany should increase its resources is a matter for the Company itself todetermine. We recommend, however, that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should inform the C.D.F.C. of the importance which they attach to its playing an increasingly important role in Commonwealth development, and that the Treasury,in consultation with the Bank of England, should consider what practical helpcould be given to the Company in meeting its present problem. We would hopethat official advice to the Capital Issues Committee in relation to any applicationfrom the Company to raise capital would be in favourable terms. In general weshould like to see the C.D.F.C. placed on a comparable footing with that of theFinance Corporation for Industry, which functions in a somewhat similar field inthe United Kingdom and which has an authorised capital of  25 millions andborrowing powers up to  100 millions.&apos; 54. Investment by United Kingdom Firms. Investment by United kingdom firms out of their own resources, including the ploughing back of profits, makesup the rest of the United Kingdom private investment in the sterling Common-wealth; it is not subject to control and represents a very important part of private investment. A most valuable stimulus, which we warmly support, has been givento this by the recent tax concession in respect of British companies operatingoverseas. We understand that about three-quarters of the tax relief will go to commonwealth countries, and we feel that this fact, which is of great importance,should be more widely publicised.
Exchequer Funds55. We have already noted that the major part of the capital requirements for Commonwealth development can be met from local resources mobilised invarious ways. To meet the remaining demand there are the resources of theworld&apos;s capital markets, in particular of course the London market, and of privateenterprise generally. To these resources may be added the International Bank andsuch further aid as may be expected from the United Slates Government. Theseare unlikely on past showing to match the very large capital requirementsforeshadowed by the development plans for different Commonwealth countries.&quot;None the less, when placed in this perspective, the remaining source, that of theUnited Kingdom Exchequer (together with such aid as might be forthcoming fromother Commonwealth Governments), must fairly be regarded as a marginal one for the Commonwealth generally, though it may sometimes be of great importance.56. The above principle does not hold good in relation to the Colonies.There is a clear distinction between Her Majesty^ Governments responsibilities to dependent territories on the one hand and to the independent Commonwealthon the other. The Secretary of State for the Colonies is answerable to parliament for the administration of the. United Kingdom&apos;s dependent overseas territories and our colonial record must be justified before world opinion. Moreover, thestate of political and economic development of these territories tends to make thema less attractive proposition for the private investor, faced as he now is with heavy competition for his money. It is thus necessary for a substantial share ofthe capital finance required for Colonial development to be made available fromExchequer sources, and grants and loans to the Colonies under the colonial development and Welfare Acts will total  220 millions during 1946-60. Indeed,so difficult has it latterly proved to raise the balance of the external loans required on the London market that the Colonial Secretary is putting forward proposals fora considerable increase in the amount of Exchequer assistance to the Colonies inthe years immediately ahead.57. On the other hand, Her Majesty&apos;s Government bear no direct responsibility for the well-being of the independent Commonwealth, importantthough it is that its cohesion should be sustained for political, economic and strategic reasons. There has not, therefore, been any system of direct exchequer loans to independent Commonwealth countries as a matter of policy, though usehas on occasion been made of the sterling contribution to the International Bank(paragraph 58 below) and to loans under Section 3 of the Export Guarantees Acts,1949-52 (paragraph 59 below). Each such case has been judged on its merits, and decided on the basis of the United Kingdom&apos;s interests. We see no reason to departfrom this general policy, particularly at a time when the United Kingdom is instraitened circumstances and when increasing demands are being received from theColonies. We do not, therefore, advocate the setting up of any new machinery forthe distribution of United Kingdom Exchequer funds to independent countries ofthe Commonwealth in the shape of capital for development.58. International Bank Sterling Releases. In 1953 the United KingdomGovernment undertook to release by 1959  60 millions of the sterling subscriptionto the I.B.R.D. for use for development schemes in .the Colonies and those sterling commonwealth countries which are members of the International Bank. ThoughHer Majesty&apos;s Government lay down general conditions governing these releases,they cannot directly influence the Bank in its selection of individual projects.Authorised releases totalled  39-3 millions by the end of 1956 though none has sofar been made available for lending in the Colonies. The United Kingdom&apos;soutgoings from this source will continue for at least another two years at the rateof some  10 millions per annum.59. Export Credits Guarantee Loans. Under section 3 of the export guarantees Acts, 1949-52, Her Majesty&apos;s Government are able to provide creditsin circumstances of special need for the purchase of United Kingdom goods and services. A loan of  10 millions to Pakistan was authorised in 1953 to help financepurchases of United Kingdom equipment for agricultural development schemes,and a loan of  15 millions to India was agreed in 1956 to help finance the purchaseof United Kingdom equipment for the third Indian steel works. This channel willremain available to meet cases of particular difficulty as and when they arise: ithas the merit of flexibility but, tied as it is specifically to the purchase of UnitedKingdom goods, it cannot serve as a universal instrument.   The possibility of
making the grant of any loans involving Government money conditional in all casesupon their not being used to finance contracts won by competitors of UnitedKingdom firms is at first sight attractive. This would, however, involve gravepolitical and administrative disadvantages and would run counter to the UnitedKingdom^ own long-term interest to secure the firm establishment over the wholefield of international trade of the principle of international competitive bidding.60. Colonial Development Corporation. The C.D.C. was set up underthe Overseas Resources Development Act, 1948, with the duty of &quot; securingthe investigation, formulation, and carrying out of projects for developingresources of Colonial territories, with a view to the expansion of productiontherein of foodstuffs and raw materials, or for other agricultural, industrialor trade development therein.&quot; The Overseas Resources Development act of 1956 redefined the purpose of the Corporation as being to assist colonial territories in the development of their economies. The Corporation was intended primarily to fill the gap between basic development of the type normallyfinanced by Colonial Governments (from local funds, loans on the london market, and Colonial Development and Welfare (CD. &amp; W.) funds) and privateenterprise development of the type that requires no special stimulus: its functionbeing to seek out and promote commercial-type projects which were desirable froma development point of view, but too risky, too marginal, or too long-term to attractprivate enterprise in the normal way. It was always recognised that theCorporation should supplement, and not supplant, other means, both public and private, of fostering Colonial development.61. The Corporation has operated in a very wide field of interests includingagriculture, industry and manufactures, fisheries, forestry, hotels, mining, housing,power and transport. Its mode of operation has, however, altered significantlysince its first establishment. Between 1948 and 1950 the Corporation wasexpansionist and managed directly most of its projects, in some cases with financiallydisastrous results. Since 1951, the Corporation has followed a policy of cautionand retrenchment, and has tended, and wisely, to operate mainly in association with private enterprise or colonial government authorities. A feature of this periodhas been the high proportion of &quot; safe &quot; loans, which now amount to some  35millions out of total commitments of  85 millions. For the same reason it hastended to concentrate on the more rewarding fields for investment (such as central africa) instead of the more difficult task, for which it was originally intended, of stimulating the commercial development of less attractive areas. The extent towhich the Corporation has invested in such safe loans has attracted considerable criticism in Parliament and in the Public Accounts Committee, and in August 1956the Colonial Secretary gave an assurance to Parliament, that, in consultation withthe Corporation, he would ensure that a reasonable balance was maintained between this and the Corporation^ other types of activity.62. The statutory borrowing powers of the Corporation are limited to  100millions outstanding at any one time (plus  10 millions by way of overdraft or othershort-term borrowings), and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, with theconsent of the Treasury, is empowered to advance up to this amount to theCorporation. As a matter of administrative practice, advances are made only inrespect of schemes which have had the prior approval of the Secretary of State andthe concurrence of the Treasury. Though under the terms of the Act theCorporation is not restricted to borrowing from the Exchequer, advances from theExchequer are made at rates based on Government credit and, in the case of long-term loans, do not start paying interest for seven years so as to give projects timeto fructify: this means that the Corporation could not hope to meet its requirements from any other source on such favourable terms; and in practice thewhole of its borrowing (apart from some short-term borrowing) has been from theExchequer. The total commitments so far sanctioned amount to  85-6 millions(of v/hich the Corporation has spent some  57 millions), and the Corporationestimates that all the uncommitted balance, and more, will be required to bringexisting projects to fruition. If therefore the Corporation is to go on undertakingnew projects in the Colonies, further funds will be required in the near future. Forthis purpose legislation will be necessary.63. Somewhat extravagant claims are sometimes made regarding theimportance of the Corporation^ role in Colonial development, and it is therefore
desirable to place it in perspective. It is only one of several sources of capital and enterprise for Colonial development viz.: local resources, Colonial Govern-ment borrowings on the London Market, private enterprise in direct development,private financial institutions and CD. &amp; W. funds. Gross capital formation inthe Colonies in 1956 is estimated to have been of the order of  450 millions(excluding Hong Kong), of which about  90 millions is estimated to have comefrom external sources. The average capital expenditure of the Corporation overthe past five years has been about  74- millions per annum, including safe loans.Altogether continuing Corporation projects representing capital commitments of 74 millions number 66, of which 12 (representing capital commitments of 34 millions or over 45 per cent, of the total) are straight loans, mainly to governments and statutory bodies. The 66 projects are distributed among 23territories. While the impact has been important and valuable in getting projectsstarted in some territories, it is apparent that the Corporation^ activities represent only a small fraction of the total commercial and financial structure of the Colonies.Moreover there are several territories in which the Corporation have so far notundertaken any projects.64. The Corporation has acquired expertise in dealing with the problemsof commercial-type economic development in underdeveloped countries; but inthis respect the Corporation is not, of course, unique (e.g., Barclay&apos;s overseas development Corporation, and various large private concerns); and for successful operation it has to seek partners and expertise from the commercial community.65. The Governments present policy on the position of the Corporation in colonial territories which achieve independence is that while the corporation should be able to continue, after a territory becomes independent, with projectsstarted before independence and if necessary invest further capital in such projects,it should not undertake any new schemes in that territory after independence.The primary reason for this policy was that, with independence, Her Majesty&apos;governments responsibility for the well-being and development of a territoryceases; and the Corporation was set up specifically as an instrument for the fulfilment of Her Majesty*s Governments direct responsibilities for its dependent territories. Effect was given to this policy in the Ghana Independence Act, and itwas made clear that it would apply to other territories which attain independence.This policy aroused considerable opposition in Parliament and from theCorporation on two main grounds: first, that it deprived a newly independent commonwealth country of assistance which it would need; second, that it doomedthe Corporation to eventual extinction. The Corporation has said, in its annual report for 1956, that because of its efficiency and experience it should become the&quot; chosen instrument &quot; of the United Kingdor - Government for promoting economic development in at least the newly independent countries of the Commonwealth, aswell as in the Colonies. The Governments of Ghana and the Federation of. Malayahave both urged that the Corporation should be turned into an instrument of commonwealth development so that this channel of United Kingdom Exchequerfunds shall remain available to them.66. We have considered whether the C.D.C. could not after all be allowed toundertake new projects in Ghana, the Federation of Malaya, and in other colonial territories after they have attained independence. Such a course would maintain an existing channel of investment in such territories and would relieve the C.D.C.from its fear that its functions will gradually atrophy as the principal Coloniesbecome independent. One means to this end which has been mentioned by theChairman of the Corporation would be to bring about some association betweenthe C.D.C. and the C.D.F.C., or perhaps to merge the former in a new commonwealth Development Corporation.67. We have not however felt able to recommend any departure from thepolicy to which effect was given in the Ghana Independence Act. There are in ourview overriding reasons for adhering to that policy.68. First, we regard it as fundamental that the decision whether to makeExchequer assistance available to independent countries should remain, as hitherto,a function of Government. Ministers must retain unfettered freedom to decide the scale and nature of any such assistance according to the circumstances. Thedecision will usually be governed by political more than by economic considerations.It is also essential that, the negotiations for any such assistance should be directly
in the hands of Government so that we can, be in the best position to obtain,directly or indirectly, any quid pro quo that we may desire. To place this responsibility in the hands of a statutory Corporation with a large measure of independent responsibility (but not final responsibility) could make it impossibleto achieve whatever objectives Her Majesty&apos;s Government might have in view in granting assistance. It could also involve Her Majesty&apos;s Government inembarrassing situations, for example, where a project was desired both by anindependent Government and the Corporation (for its own reasons), but the UnitedKingdom Government were not for some reason prepared to sanction the money.Instances of this type do already occur in relations with Colonial Governments and could be more seriously embarrassing in relations between the United KingdomGovernment and independent Commonwealth Governments.69. Second, the extension of the functions of the Corporation to embraceindependent countries would raise the question of Ministerial responsibility. Sincethe Corporation^ primary function would still remain that of assisting colonial territories Ministerial responsibility for the Corporation would clearly have toremain with the Colonial Secretary. Such an arrangement would increase the embarrassment which would occur when there were conflicts of view between her majesty&apos;s Government and the Corporation regarding any project which they andthe independent Commonwealth Government concerned wished to be undertaken.70. Thirdly, any decision to make the Corporation a primary channel for commercial and financial assistance to the independent Commonwealth would beof no significance unless substantial funds were allocated to the Corporation forthis purpose. As has already been stated, further funds will be necessary to enablethe Corporation to continue to embark on new projects in the Colonies.Once the principle were conceded, there would be constant pressure for increasingthe- funds available to the Corporation for investment in independent countries,perhaps to the detriment of its main purpose of Colonial development. In thepresent state of our finances, we cannot recommend any system which would encourage pressures of this sort to build up.71. In this connection we have considered whether it would be possible toallot funds to the Corporation to operate in newly-independent commonwealth countries, subject to the important proviso that they would be debarred by statutefrom making any loans to the Governments of those countries, or to Government-controlled corporations. We do not consider that this course would be desirable.Loans by the Corporation to privately-controlled organisations in independent commonwealth countries would be open to the objections stated in paragraph 68above, though possibly less so than loans to Governments would be. We alsodoubt whether newly-independent Commonwealth Governments would wish to see Corporation controlled by the United Kingdom Government having a majorvoice in any important sector of their economy, and they would be unlikely tosee much profit in an arrangement which did not enable them to use theCorporation as a source of loan finance for their own needs and those of bodiesunder their control: but this we rule out for the reasons stated in paragraph 68.Furthermore if the Corporation were restricted to investment in commercial-typeprojects not owned by Government or Government-sponsored bodies, the effect onthe economies of the Commonwealth countries concerned could be only verymarginal, though it might well tie a substantial amount of United KingdomGovernment capital which we could put to better use in other ways. The only possible advantage of such an arrangement might be that it might go some way tosatisfy the Corporation and allay their fears as to their future, and might meet tosome extent that section of opinion which supports the Corporation^ claims.72. We do not, however, accept that, unless it can continue to embark on new projects in territories which attain independence, the C.D.C. has no worthwhilefuture. It must be remembered that the Corporation will continue to manageinvestments which may eventually exceed  100 millions. It cannot be an objective of Government policy to maintain the Corporation in being as an end in itself, butwe are satisfied that for many years to come it will have ample scope for its activities in Colonial territories, including several large ones such as Kenya,Uganda and Tanganyika, whose needs for external capital are very considerable.There will thus, in any case, remain a most important and valuable role for theC.D.C. in the dependent territories, and we should support an increase in theirborrowing powers for this purpose.   If, however the proposals now being made
D, The Special. Problem of the Newly-Independent CommonwealthCountries74. We recognise, however, that circumstances could arise in which ghana and Malaya and in due course the other countries now on the road to independence presented a special problem which could not wholly be dealt withby clear-cut arrangements on the lines so far discussed in this report. Under these,such countries would be cut off from access to Colonial Development and Welfarefunds and from further capital from the C.D.C. Access to the London marketis at present restricted by the tight money policy and, in any event, private investorsmay well prefer to put their money into countries whose political stability is proven,rather than to risk investing it in countries whose Governments have to demonstrateeither their efficiency or their reliability. There may, therefore, be a gap which anewly-independent country will be unable to bridge unless it receives assistancefrom the United Kingdom Exchequer, and it can be argued that the UnitedKingdom has a powerful political and economic interest in ensuring the successof die constitutional experiment embodied in the fact of these countries&apos;independence.75. On the other hand, we are not convinced that the problem will necessarily be of large dimensions. The figures of external demand shown in paragraph 18above, show that for the countries likely to reach independence in the period1955-60 (Ghana and the Federation of Malaya) the total external demand for thefive years amounts to about  30 millions. Both Ghana and Malaya possess largereserves in the form of Government-owned sterling balances, amounting to 86 and  83 millions respectively, some part of which at least could be madeavailable for economic development; and it is in the United Kingdom interest that these should be reduced at a manageable rate rather than that a furtherstrain should be placed on the United Kingdom economy and the United Kingdomtaxpayer by disbursing Exchequer money. The Federation of Malaya is richlyendowed with natural resources, and has the highest national income per headin South-East Asia; and in recent negotiations a settlement has been reached,acceptable to both parties, which sets the pattern for the financial relationships between the Federation and the United Kingdom after independence. In the caseof Ghana however the effect of the fall in the price of cocoa on her ability tograpple successfully with the initial problems of independence presents a problem.Moreover, the extent of Ghana&apos;s capital needs will be very considerably affectedby the decisions on the one main development project under consideration theproposed Volta River dam.by the Colonial Secretary for alternative sources of loan finance for colonial governments are accepted, we do not think that ordinarily the CDC. shouldcontinue to make Scans to Colonial Governments or statutory bodies. It may also turn out tc re to the advantage of those colonies in which the C.D.C.have not yet in&quot;. etted if events compel the Corporation to concentrate its energiesin fields which ha&apos;-e not so far succeeded in attracting much, if any, interest onthe Corporation^ part though a greater degree of initiative may well be required on its part in pre.meting development in economically less attractive areas. TheCorporation will also have the responsibility for managing its investments in those territories which become independent (save to the extent to which it is willing to dispose of such irevestments). The Corporation^ investment in Ghana has beenvery small only cree project, amounting to  350,000. Its interests in the Federationof Malaya are iarxer: existing or approved investments total some  124 millions(by far the greater part of which is safe loans).73. While, therefore, we are strongly of the opinion that the policy set out at the time of the Ghana Independence Bill should be adhered to, we have two recommendations to make. First, we consider that this policy should be implemented by means of an amendment to the Overseas Resources DevelopmentActs themselves, so as to avoid the necessity for a separate provision in every Actgranting independence to a Colonial territory. Secondly, we recommend that theActs should be amended so as to authorise the Corporation, on the request of any independent Commonwealth Government, to second to that Government anymembers of the Corporation^ staff, or to undertake the management of any projecton a managing agency basis (without commitment of the Corporation^ funds).
76. The problem thus reduces itself to one of measurable and not unduemagnitude and confirms our disposition against creating a generalised system of exchequer assistance for the benefit of newly-independent countries without distinction. Such a system wouid in any case be likely to be unworkable inpractice, as it would be difficult, and probably impossible, to prevent its extension to other Commonwealth Governments such as India and Pakistan; and to set upa fund available for one and all would probably mean the dissipation in small amounts of resources which could far more effectively be used to meet an exceptional situation. There would be other harmful effects of creating any new system on these lines: it would damage the credit-worthiness of the countries concerned; it would discourage local governments from taking those measures ofeconomic discipline which would attract private capital; and would on the onehand, by offering the possibility of subsidy, be likely to&quot; encourage requests forpremature independence and on the other would condemn the United kingdom to an indefinite period of tutelage of countries for which we had no formalresponsibility. Moreover, any announcement of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfswillingness to invest up to any particular limit within a specified period wouidcarry with it the risk that a financial crisis might compel the United Kingdom toretract from this undertaking, and as a result lose far more credit politically than would have been gained from having given it.77. We conclude, therefore, that the situation would be adequately met ifHer Majesty&apos;s Government, while maintaining a general policy on the lines whichwe have indicated in this report, did not exclude the possibility of some Exchequerassistance to a newly-independent country during the initial years of itsindependence. The form which such aid would take could be various and would fall to be discussed and adjusted to the circumstances at the time. In the event,such assistance would be likely to be for reasons other than ordinary commercialones and might be advanced on strategic or political grounds. Any such arrangements would, however, be in their essence special to a particular situation,and would be without prejudice to the general policy outlined in this report.
2iAppendixENQUIRY   TO   COMMONWEALTH   GOVERNMENTS   ABOUTCOMMONWEALTH DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND BANKIn the debate on Commonwealth development on the 30th November, 1956,a number of suggestions were made for the establishment of Commonwealthbodies designed to further development and investment in the Commonwealth.An undertaking was given to consult Commonwealth Governments and seek theirviews on these suggestions.2.   In essence these were for two bodies:  (i) A Commonwealth Development Agency to carry out research intoCommonwealth development potential, and schemes in the Common-wealth and to determine priorities.(ii) An associated Commonwealth Bank to invest on the basis of the prioritiesdetermined by the Agency.3. In the despatch in which High Commissioners were instructed to seek theviews of Commonwealth Governments, the difficulties which in the UnitedKingdom&apos;s view militated against the practical achievement and usefulness of these bodies were fairly stated. Commonwealth Governments were, however, told thatif the reactions of other Commonwealth Governments were to prove favourable to the creation of such new machinery, the United Kingdom would re-examine thematter with an open mind. Commonwealth Governments were asked inparticular:  (i) If they thought closer Commonwealth co-operation was practicable inthe field of development and investment, and, if so, of what nature.(ii) If they thought a co-operative approach was likely to increase the opportunities of raising capital.(iii) If they would be prepared to contribute to a Commonwealth Bank.4. Replies have now been received from all Commonwealth Governments.Generally, while they expressed sympathy with the motives underlying theproposals, they take the view that the bodies proposed are not practicable,and that there are no prospects of increasing investment in the Commonwealththrough bodies of this description. No Commonwealth Governments haveexpressed themselves as prepared to contribute to a Commonwealth Bank. ^ a minority have indicated that they would be willing to give further considerationto the question of the need for wider consultation on development and investmentif this was the general desire.

I.-SUMMARY OF REPORT AND recommendations. This second part of our report deals with the provision of technical aid.Such assistance covers a wide field of activities and will vary greatly according to thestate of economic development of the country concerned. It can take the form ofthe provision of advice, such as the sending of a high-level mission to India on the steel industry, the provision of training, e.g., the courses at Oxford and Cambridgefor probationer members of the Pakistan Civil Service, or the &apos;provision of equipment for training or research purposes.2. This is a specially valuable way of maintaining our interests in theCommonwealth because (a) in these days trade follows the expert rather than the flag.  By helping withtraining and technical advice we can encourage the continued use ofBritish methods and equipment;(b) the influence which we can exert by these means will serve to strengthencultural, and hence political links;(c) we are good at this sort of thing and have great experience in dealing withAsian and African peoples. Commonwealth countries are accustomed to look towards us for expertise;(d) the giving of such help is relatively cheap compared with the provision ofcapital. During our present period of financial stringency it does,therefore, offer an economical way of serving our interests in theCommonwealth and of maintaining Commonwealth ties.3. The point which the Committee studied with particular care was whetherthe present arrangements for providing technical aid to independent countries ofthe Commonwealth could be improved either by creating a new Commonwealthbody to this end or by developing an existing one. It became clear from the outset that such a body could only have consultative, intelligence or research functions.There is a known and understandable antipathy on the part of the commonwealth governments to any form of supra-national authority. As we have already noticedin our report on capital provision, any suggestion of machinery to co-ordinateeconomic policies and to establish priorities would therefore not be easilyacceptable to Commonwealth Governments.4. When however we came to examine the means already available withinthe Commonwealth for consultation and the provision of expert help in theeconomic field, we found little if any gap. Normally the Commonwealth relations office and the High Commissioners&apos; Offices here and overseas are tne channels for meeting requests of independent Commonwealth countries for technical aid or foroffering such help, and the Colonial Office has developed an elaborate and effective machinery over the years for the benefit of the Colonies. In addition theCommonwealth Liaison Committee, meeting in London, is concerned with theexchange of information on the economic policies of Commonwealth Governments(it has been paying particular attention to problems of Commonwealth concernarising from the European free trade area plans), and the Commonwealth EconomicCommittee collates and publishes information on Commonwealth production, tradeand consumption, and is now engaged on a major survey of Commonwealthresources generally.5. We doubt the wisdom of setting up any new body for which no obviousfunction might be seen to exist or which might arouse suspicion among othermembers of the Commonwealth or might only duplicate and perhaps clog theexisting channels for advice and aid in the economic field. We recommendhowever that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should propose to the Governments ofother independent Commonwealth countries that the scope of the commonwealth economic Committee should be expanded both to intensify its present intelligenceactivities in regard to Commonwealth resources and to extend its functions to cover the collation and publication of information about Commonwealth development and its financing. The Committee could similarly collate and publish information regarding the arrangements for the provision of technical assistance by commonwealth Governments to one another.   In general, we have in mind that
with the support of Commonwealth Governments the Commonwealth EconomicCommittee should be built up not as an executive body but as a research institution of more widely recognised standing throughout, the Commonwealth for the examination of any economic problems of common Commonwealth interest which require regular and continued study. There might be occasions on which theUnited Kingdom could appropriately draw the attention of other Commonwealthmembers to reports of the Committee. These proposals might perhaps be exploredin the context of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting.6. For the rest we have tried to give some indication of the wide range of technical assistance which the United Kingdom already makes available, whetherthrough the Colonial Office&apos;s services, through the Colombo Plan, or otherwise.We think that, without prejudice to these arrangements, the United kingdom should aim to conclude an appropriate technical assistance agreement with eachCommonwealth country as it achieves independence. It must be our policy toensure that the maximum use is made of existing.services, and we have suggestedmeans whereby the newly independent countries may be enabled to take continuedadvantage of some of the facilities previously available to them as Colonies, should they desire this. Such an arrangement would involve some changes innomenclature.7. The,latter proposal may have something stop-gap about it. Inevitablybehind it rises the question whether the time is not approaching for some reshapingof the existing division of responsibilities between the Colonial Office and theCommonwealth Relations Office. We have not pursued this matter in our report,though we believe that this problem needs to be kept constantly in mind as furtherimportant Colonial territories come nearer to the stage of full self-government.We have, however, given some thought to the related problem of whether theUnited Kingdom concern with scientific research in the Commonwealth should now become the responsibility of a single Minister. We have not been able to form afinal view on the arguments which are set out in the report. On the one hand there is the importance of close co-ordination of the United Kingdom researcheffort and its links with the Commonwealth, and the need to insure against the disruption of scientific institutions organised regionally under the aegis of theColonial Office when territories gain their independence. On the other hand, toremove from Colonial Governments their present concern financial and otherwise with scientific research would mean that when these territories reachedindependence they would lack an important element in the organisation necessaryfor a modern State.8. In view of its special importance, we end our report with a survey of thetechnical assistance which the United Kingdom is able to make available to theCommonwealth in the field of applied nuclear science. The extent of our presenthelp, and the help which we are able and ready to give, is not yet fully appreciatedthroughout the Commonwealth. But the ability of Commonwealth countries totake advantage of such help obviously varies greatly according to the stage of their economic development, and it would not be in their interest, or in our own as a world exporter of nuclear equipment, to encourage them to seek from us facilities which they could not in fact use.9.   Our recommendations are as follows:  (i) Generally we favour increasing the scope of the Commonwealth EconomicCommittee. In particular at this time we recommend the strengthening of its functions as a research institution for the study of economic problems of common Commonwealth interest. To this end her majesty&apos;s Government should propose to the Governments of independent Commonwealth countries that the Committee&apos;s work should be extended to cover the collation and publication ofinformation about Commonwealth development and its financing(including the arrangements made by Commonwealth Governments for technical aid). This matter might be explored in the context of theCommonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting; (paragraph 43).(ii) Without prejudice to existing arrangements for the giving of technical assistance, Her Majesty&apos;s Government should aim to conclude an appropriate technical assistance agreement with each commonwealth government as it achieves independence; (paragraph 18).51679 b 2
(iii) As part of the arrangements referred to in (ii) above,&apos; the Colonial OfficeAdvisory Services should be made available through the Common-.; .    wealth Relations Office to those independent Commonwealth countrieswhich desire them; (paragraph 27).(iv) The Commonwealth Relations Office should consider how far theadministrative arrangements for the Colombo Plan technical co-operation Scheme can be improved; (paragraph 15).(v) The question of departmental responsibility for the United Kingdomconcern with scientific research in the Commonwealth should be further examined; (paragraph 31).(vi) More publicity is needed for the facilities which the United Kingdom isable to offer to Commonwealth Governments in the field of appliednuclear science. The possibility of periodic Commonwealth conferenceson co-operation in atomic development for peaceful purposes might bediscussed with the Commonwealth Prime Ministers; (paragraphs 48-49).II. -TECHNICAL ASSISTANCEA. Nature and Importance of Technical Assistance10. Technical assistance covers a very wide field and can take many formsaccording to the state of economic development of the country concerned. Itwill vary from the provision of advice, whether by advisers resident in the country concerned or by visiting experts or missions or by correspondence with institutions in this country, to the provision of training for students from the country concerned, or the provision of equipment for training or research purposes. Forexample, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have recently sent out high-level missionsto India on heavy engineering, and have provided Pakistan with a head for a group of technical high schools; we arrange courses at the Administrative StaffColleges for senior civil servants in the Colombo Plan area and have providedtraining in British methods and equipment for crop protection; and in the field of equipment technical books have been supplied to libraries and institutions in pakistan and equipment to telecommunications training centres in that country.11. We are interested in the giving of technical assistance in a number of ways. In regard to the Colonial territories, for which we have special responsibilities, our objective is development for its own sake and their own good.In dealing with the independent countries of the Commonwealth our objective is rather different. There we have in mind the maintenance and furtherance ofBritish influence and interests, considered broadly and on a long-term view. Sucha view, however, demands that we should help to bring about increasing prosperitythroughout the Commonwealth which we can expect to share. Thus our broadeconomic interests and those of other Commonwealth countries coincide. Morenarrowly, we seek to extend our trade with the Commonwealth, and themaintenance of British influence by technical help is of special importance at a timewhen trade increasingly follows the expert and when as a result of our deliberatepolicy of constitutional advancement we are increasingly divesting ourselves ofpolitical control. Through the provision of technical aid and advice we may hope to encourage continued use of British standards and methods and british equipment, and to build up personal contacts and influence through the training of students in this country. Such aid will also serve a broader purpose of strengthening cultural, and thus political, links between United Kingdom and other commonwealth members. The expenditure involved is relatively small comparedwith that of capital assistance, and this may be thought to be an economic way ofmaintaining and expanding our influence (and of reducing the risks of undesirableinfiltration from other quarters), more particularly at a time when there is difficultyin increasing our overseas investment.B. Existing Channels for United Kingdom Government Technical Assistance to independent Commonwealth Countries12. The United Kingdom possesses special advantages in this matter, notonly through its great fund of expert financial, industrial, scientific and otherknowledge needed for economic development, but through the existence of a
common language throughout the Commonwealth, the practice already establishedof turning normally to this country for training and technical advice, and theexperience which we already possess of dealing with Asians and Africans. Existingtrading connections must remain the channel for the supply of the bulk, of UnitedKingdom expertise to independent Commonwealth countries in the normal courseof business dealing. The industrial, commercial, financial and cultural links between the United Kingdom on the one hand and the older commonwealth countries on the other are already so close that constant contact in the technicalfield can be maintained without any need for intervention on the part of theUnited Kingdom Government. If any of these Governments, or any organisation or firm in their countries, feel the need of technical advice or training facilities from outside their first recourse would almost certainly be to the United Kingdom,through all the channels already available to them. But in the case of ghana and the independent countries of the Commonwealth in Asia, government assistance is also needed and can be directed in ways which will benefit our interests.13. Colombo Plan Technical Co-operation Scheme. Under this Scheme helpis given by the United Kingdom bilaterally to India, Pakistan and Ceylon and toforeign countries in the Colombo Plan area. Up to 31st March, 1957, some 2 millions had been spent by the United Kingdom in aid to commonwealth countries and some  400,000 for foreign countries. In the current financial yearwe aim to spend  750,000 for Commonwealth countries in Asia and  250,000for foreign countries. The administrative arrangements are handled by theCommonwealth Relations Office. To a large extent the offers which we make areprompted by our knowledge of the needs of receiving countries obtained in thecourse of the conduct of our general relations with them.14. Other members of the Colombo Plan similarly give each other technical assistance. In particular, such help is given by Australia, Canada andNew Zealand. All this aid is given bilaterally and is not centrally organised, butcommon problems of a general nature are discussed at annual Colombo Planconferences and at a technical Co-operation Council at Colombo. The aid givenis recorded by a Bureau working under this Council.15. The Technical Co-operation Scheme of the Colombo Plan has provedits value in Asia. It is popular; it is felt to be without strings; and the UnitedKingdom contribution has been specially welcome by reason of its high quality and its flexibility. The limiting factor has so far been not finance so much as thedifficulties of obtaining sound proposals from receivng Governments or of devisingsuitable schemes to propose to them. It has also been difficult to recruit suitablyqualified experts owing to the demand for skilled manpower at home. Werecommend that the Commonwealth Relations Office should consider how far theadministrative arrangements for the operation of this scheme could be improved.It might, for example, be worth considering whether our representation in someof the countries concerned could be specially strengthened for this purpose. If,as a result of this study, scope for further expenditure emerges, the possibility ofproviding more money should be considered in the light of the economic circumstances prevailing at the time.16. The Federation of Malaya. At present the Federation of Malaya doesnot get help under the Colombo Plan Technical Co-operation Scheme from theUnited Kingdom. Technical aid is provided from the Colonial Officr sourcesmentioned below, much of it being financed from Colonial Development and welfare Funds. The Federation also gets help under the Colombo Plan technical co-operation Scheme from Australia, Canada and New Zealand. On becomingindependent, the Federation will automatically qualify for help from the UnitedKingdom under the Technical Co-operation Scheme on the same basis as India,Pakistan and Ceylon, and arrangements to put this into effect are already in hand.17. Ghana. Under the new Technical Assistance Scheme for Ghanaannounced on 2nd April, officers nominated by the Government of Ghana from among their public servants will come to the United Kingdom at the expenseof Her Majesty&apos;s Government for training in technical and practical subjects, andthe United Kingdom will be ready to supply the Government of Ghana withexperts to fill technical and scientific posts of a temporary or advisory nature, thecost of such experts being shared between the two Governments. .
18. We recommend that as further Colonies achieve independence theUnited. Kingdom should seek to conclude an appropriate agreement with each ofthem for the provision of technical assistance as a means of maintaining British influence. Any such agreement, whose financial implication need not be large,would naturally take account of any existing arrangements for the provision ofUnited Kingdom technical assistance, and would be unnecessary in cases (such asMalaya) where the needs of a country for technical aid would already be coveredby an existing regional scheme.C-Other Channels for Technical Assistance to independent commonwealth Countries19. The main non-Commonwealth sources of technical aid are the united nations Technical Assistance Board (U.N.T.A.B.), which covers the whole range of technical assistance, together with the other international specialised agencies.The United Kingdom contribution to U.N.T.A.B. is  800,000 a year. We alsocontribute just under   1 million a year to the three specialised agencies concernedwith technical assistance, but it is not possible to say how much of the lattercontribution goes to technical assistance and how much of that goes to the countries of the Commonwealth. During the period 1949-54 the United States providedtechnical assistance for our African and Far Eastern Colonial territories to an estimated cost of $1J millions, and for the period 1954-56 the international co--operation Authority have allocated $1-6 millions for technical assistance in africa, though the actual expenditure of this money is proving slow. Americantechnical assistance to our West Indian territories is estimated at $700,000 for theperiod 1949-56. Further large sums have been made available to India and other independent countries in Asia, under the aegis of the Colombo Plan. Russianaid has been entirely confined to India and has been on a relatively small scale.Comparatively minor contributions were also made by research foundations, suchas the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations, and by countries which can offer aparticular type of expertise, such as the Scandinavian countries possess on fisheryquestions.20. It is desirable in our own interests and that of the Commonwealthgenerally that the independent countries of the Commonwealth should continueto receive their full share of the technical advice and assistance which may beavailable on an international basis and from other countries. Indeed, there maybe occasions when we could usefully co-operate in the giving of technical assistancewith other countries or international organisations: there will continue to be afruitful field of co-operation with the International Bank, and, as has been noticedin our previous report on capital provision, the possibility is being studied of ascheme of international assistance for the African territories on the lines of the colombo Plan. There may, however, be times when Commonwealth countriesseek expert help from outside the Commonwealth for their economic development plans which could as well be provided by the United Kingdom or other commonwealth countries. On the theory that trade follows the expert, this situation needs to be watched and may call for further consideration at some time.It is specially valuable where technical co-operation can be organised on a regionalbasis and in a Commonwealth context. For example, the Canadian government,:e considering most sympathetically a proposal which we have made to themthat they might join with us in helping the Caribbean Federation, and if they agree we could consider with the Canadian Government whether some other commonwealth Governments could join us in a co-ordinated scheme.D. The Colonial Office Advisory Services21. The technical assistance available to British Colonies from the UnitedKingdom is provided partly from purely official sources such as the professionalstaff of the Colonial Office and the Government scientific research facilities-andpartly from unofficial sources for which the various Colonial Office AdvisoryCommittees act as a focus.
2.2. There are some thirty whole-time professional staff belonging to theColonial Office who deal with Colonial agriculture (including animal health,fisheries, forestry, pesticides, &amp;c.) education, health, labour, social welfare,co-operative societies, housing and engineering. Through the AdvisoryCommittees these staff have access to institutions and persons throughout thecountry who are prominent in these fields of knowledge. The ways in which theservices of these staff are drawn upon are many and various.23. The main scientific facilities provided by the United KingdomGovernment for the benefit of Colonial Governments comprise the ColonialGeological Survey, the Overseas (Geodetic and Topographic) Surveys, and theColonial Products Laboratory. Some of the results of work done for colonial governments by these bodies are also made available to the independent commonwealth Governments on request.24. The Advisory Committees (which are listed in Appendix A) cover a wide range of subjects and in their membership represent the foremost authorities ineach of their respective fields. Two of the main Committees are the ColonialAgricultural Research Committee and the Colonial Medical Research Committee,both of which v/ork in close co-operation with the equivalent bodies in the UnitedKingdom. The Chairman of these and certain other Committees comprise theColonial Research Council which, under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Statefor Colonial Affairs, advises the Colonial Secretary on general questions relatingto research policy in the Colonies, co-ordinates the work of the various researchCommittees, and advises on any research matters not falling within the province of any of the other Committees. In addition to these Committees there are two committees in the field of education which by virtue of an almost entirely unofficialmembership and Chairmanship are more independent of the Colonial Office. Theseare the Inter-University Council and the Advisory Committee on Colonial colleges of Arts, Science and Technology, representing universities and technical collegesrespectively.Use of Colonial Office Advisory Services  by Independent CommonwealthCountries25. In a number of fields now covered by the Colonial Office AdvisoryServices it would not be appropriate for United Kingdom Government assistanceto be proffered to the independent Commonwealth: for example, the ColonialOffice advise on policy in such fields as labour and education. Some newly-independent countries may feel too that they no longer want assistance in certainfields and may, therefore, be less inclined to accept offers of help. Indeed, theymay be inclined to accept offers of aid, particularly of economic aid, from other sources with a view simply to taking whatever is going: there may be at times atendency deliberately to offset United Kingdom interests by preferring aid from elsewhere. Finally, there will no doubt be a very strong emotional prejudice againstaccepting aid from any source, particularly the United Kingdom, wlnGh could beregarded as &quot; Colonial aid &quot; and as such no longer in keeping with the self-respectof an independent State. Questions of nomenclature may bear a disproportionateimportance.26. None the less there will remain a number of fields in which a continuingneed will be felt by newly-independent countries of the Commonwealth for servicesof the same kind as they received previously as Colonies. There can of course beno question of our trying to exert pressure on newly-independent members of theCommonwealth to accept a continuation of such services. But we need not feelinhibited in seeking tactfully to ensure that continuous use is made of the technicalservices which we can provide. Thus, when useful technical links have been built up between newly-independent territories and the United Kingdom these shouldbe allowed to continue; enquiries received from technical authorities in thesecountries should as far as possible be dealt with; and requests for help a night bediscreetly stimulated.27. We recommend therefore that the Government of Ghana (and of other independent territories when the appropriate time arrives) should be told that her majesty&apos;s Government are ready as part of the United Kingdom^ technical assistance effort on their behalf to continue to provide advisory services of the sort which they have received in the past, so far as they would like them.
In providing such assistance, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would draw upon a wide variety of experience in the United Kingdom Government Departments,nationalised corporations and private enterprise. In many cases it would be natural that such advice would be sought through the facilities available in and throughthe Colonial Office: but contact with the Government of the country concerned would be through the High Commissioners and the Commonwealth relations office. &quot;     . , -: - . .&apos; , .. . ,    .28. Some expenditure would be involved in the extension of the ColonialOffice facilities to independent Commonwealth countries. Some of this might properly continue to be financed from Colonial Development and Welfare(CD. and W.) funds, in that its primary purpose, e.g., in connection with a piece of research, would be to benefit Colonial territories, or the cost of the service wouldbe unattributable or minimal. It has not, however, been the intention of her majesty&apos;s Government that CD. and W. funds should be used either wholly or partly for the benefit of independent countries, and some ether source of finance-must therefore be found in general for the extension of technical assistance whichwe advocate. Some of this would doubtless be covered by the new technical assistance Scheme for Ghana, referred to in paragraph 17 above; and theFederation of Malaya will qualify for assistance under the Technical Co-operationScheme of the Colombo Plan. In some cases, it would no doubt be appropriate toask the Government of the country concerned to meet the cost of the services rendered. In general we anticipate no difficulty in regard to Ghana and theFederation of Malaya.-&apos; 29. Some alternation v/ould be required in the nomenclature of some of the organisations operating under the Colonial Office, in order to replace the word&quot; Colonial &quot; in their title. It might be desirable to give to the Colonial OfficeAdvisers the additional style of Consultants to the Commonwealth Secretary, if, aswe hope, the work which they are called upon to undertake in respect of independent members of the Commonwealth justifies such a step. On the otherhand, the provision of such services to newly-independent countries must involveas little disturbances to existing arrangements as possible. The main users of these services must still be the Colonial territories. Nothing, therefore, should be done which would either disrupt or dilute the provision of services to the territories for whose progress and welfare the United Kingdom Government would still beresponsible through the Colonial Office.E. Organisational Problems30. It remains to be seen whether such an adaptation of the Colonial OfficeAdvisory -Services to the needs of independent Commonwealth countries would work satisfactorily in the long term^and be fully compatible with their jealousyof their independent status. Some of us think that this could be no more thana stopgap arrangement and that some more radical change can probably not belong deferred. Consideration is, we know, being given to the far-reaching problems involved in any reshaping of the existing division of the responsibility betweenthe Colonial and Commonwealth Relations Offices. We have not thought itappropriate to examine this matter further in this report. The proposal whichwe make in paragraph 27 above could, however, be adopted without anyreorganisation and would equally, we think, be consistent with any wider changes which it might be found necessary to make later on.Future Responsibility for Scientific Research in the Colonies31. We have, however, given some thought to the related topic of departmental responsibility for scientific research in the Colonies. It has beensuggested that the whole responsibility for United Kingdom concern with scientific research in the Commonwealth should be centralised under a single Minister,namely, the Lord President, of the Council. This suggestion would entail major changes in policy and we have not felt able to form a final view on it, though werecommend that it should be further examined by the Departments concerned.Our discussions of the subject have, however, brought out a number of argumentsboth for and against the suggestion which are set out below. A distinction mustbe drawn between the interest of the United Kingdom in maintaining a leadingposition in the scientific world and in furthering the cause of scientific research
generally and the interests of the Commonwealth countries themselves, particularly the Colonies. These interests are not necessarily incompatible, but will very oftenlead to a difference of emphasis or priority.32. In favour of the suggestion it can be argued that the vesting ofresponsibility for scientific research in one United Kingdom Minister could mean that the United Kingdom research effort and its scientific links with the othermembers of the Commonwealth would be more closely co-ordinated. It might also help to reduce the risk that where scientific institutions have under the auspices of the Colonial Office been organised on an inter-territorial basis newly-independent countries might wreck the institutions by withdrawing from them. Moreover itmust be recognised that the prospects of any worthwhile research being undertaken by the Governments of newly-independent Commonwealth countries is remote,since they have neither the trained personnel nor the facilities needed for thepurpose.33. The establishment of such inter-territorial bodies has for soundscientific reasons been urged on Colonial Governments by the Colonial Officethroughout all the post-war expansion of research in the Colonies. The colonial secretary&apos;s particular interest in this policy has been reflected institutionally intwo ways. In the first place he has been given power in several instances to nominate members of the governing bodies of inter-territorial organisations.These nominations are intended to reflect the financial contributions which her Majesty&apos;s Government have made to the bodies concerned and to provide a link with United Kingdom science. The latter purpose could be fulfilled equallywell by transferring powers of nomination to the Lord President, and the financial reasons behind the Colonial Secretary&apos;s right of nomination would probably inany event be diminished in the course of time. Secondly, in West Africa theColonial Secretary has been given more extensive powers in respect of inter-territorial institutions, e.g., the right of nomination of Directors and Chairmanof Managing Committees and the right of approving budgets. The historicalreasons for these powers derive from the fact that in West Africa, unlike EastAfrica and the West Indies, there was no statutory political or quasi politicalmachinery of co-ordination between the Governments, and the Colonial secretary was given these powers primarily with the intention that he could act as an honestbroker and court of appeal in the event of disagreement between the West african governments. Those Governments might in present circumstances be prepared toaccept ad hoc arbitration by the Lord President, but it is more problematicalwhether they would consider the formal transfer of the powers at present givento the Colonial Secretary to another United Kingdom Minister, the more so becausepart of the present difficulty arises from the dislike of an independent territory of being associated with or possibly out-voted *by neighbours of &quot; inferior &quot; status.34. It is possible also that the centralisation of responsibility, with the corollary that research was financed from what might be regarded as the UnitedKingdom&apos;s domestic budget (and therefore more permanent than CD. and W.funds), might make it easier to find United Kingdom scientific staff willing to workoverseas or at home on projects of Commonwealth interest.35. There are, however, a number of objections to the suggestion financial,administrative and political. The policy of the Colonial Office has been to try and build up a partnership with the Colonial territories in scientific research as in othermatters, financial responsibility being shared between the local Governments andCD. and W. funds. Colonial development in its widest sense means the bringing forward of the Colonies to full internal self-government and, where this is practicable, ultimate independence. We are particularly concerned with those territories which are on the threshold of independence or, like Ghana, have justattained it. The possession of institutions and other facilities for scientific research and the consequent responsibility for scientific research is as much part of the equipment of a modern State as is the possession of a modern education system,banking system or any other branch of public administration. To take the wholeresponsibility for scientific research out of the hands of the local Governmentsduring the Colonial period would mean that when these territories reachindependence, they reach it with an important lacuna in their organisation. Thesharing of financial responsibility up to that stage is a means of helping theterritory gradually to assume the financial burden during the transitional period.51679      &quot; c
101736. So long as the Colonial Secretary is responsible for the United kingdom share of these expenses (which if the above argument is accepted is a necessarycorollary), he will continue to need the services of Advisory Committees on the programmes of expenditure. The overlap with the Lord President^ AdvisoryCommittee is thus unavoidable; but at the same time it provides an importantopportunity for close collaboration between the scientific research work of theUnited Kingdom and that of the Colonies.37. The Research Department of the Colonial Office is concerned rather withthe administration of research schemes than with the scientific direction of research,and this involves considerations concerning the recruitment and terms of serviceof scientific personnel which cannot be divorced from political considerations inthe territories concerned. This would imply the continued existence of the presentColonial Office research administrative machine, which might well have to beretained within the Colonial Office in view of the necessity for close consultationwith other Departments of the Colonial Office.Commonwealtil Machinery for Consultation and Advice on Technical Matters38. We have given much thought to the question whether some new commonwealth machinery would be desirable in the sphere of economic development in order further to strengthen Commonwealth ties. Any suggestion of a body with some overriding authority in this sphere would certainly be resisted.Nor are Commonwealth Governments likely to favour any idea of machinery withthe aim of co-ordinating economic policies on the broad lines of O.E.E.C. Theeconomic circumstances of Commonwealth countries are not truly analogous withthose of member countries of O.E.E.C., the latter of whom are a coherent,contiguous group of countries in a comparable state of economic development,each trading to a very considerable extent with all of the others; and in any caseO.E.E.C. has ventured little, if at all, in the field of economic development proper.For these reasons, the response of Commonwealth Governments to the suggestion which was recently put to them for a body to co-ordinate development policieswas negative. It is clear, therefore, that agreement would not be forthcomingto the creation of a new body or the development of an existing body if these were to be concerned with questions of policy.39. We have explored the place for new machinery to provide experteconomic or technical advice particularly to the Governments of newlyindependent countries in connection with their development plans and progress.Such a body might serve to provide a specifically Commonwealth channel for the sort of advice which is now being made available by the International Bank to governments in drawing up long-term development plans. It might also maintainlists cf experts available in various technical fields. Such a body would be dependant for its existence on its political acceptability and on the calibre andqualifications of its staff. It would need to be responsible to a Committee or board as widely representative of the Commonwealth as possible, and have asmall full-time secretariat and administrative organisation. It should be able to seek advice as necessary from industry and commerce, finance, universities, technicalinstitutions and Governments in any part of the Commonwealth. It might also have the function of publicising what is being done for commonwealth development generally.40. Further examination, however, of this suggestion raised doubts as to its practical value. It is difficult to conduct effective economic planning on a nationalscale by means of extra-governmental advisory services of this sort, in that economic development is so closely bound up with the financial and taxation policies of theGovernment concerned. As regards advice on more detailed matters affectingdevelopment, such, for example, as the provision of an expert for a particular industry, experience under the Colombo Plan Technical Co-operation Scheme hasshown that a central body cannot hope to become more efficient in finding the bestman for a particular assignment than can individual Governments. It may indeedmerely become a delaying factor. For this reason, any idea of channelling requests for technical aid under the Colombo Plan through the Bureau at Colombo asa regular system was abandoned at an early stage. To go further and, for example;,to surrender to such a body the administration of our share of the Colombo PlanTechnical Co-operation Scheme, would be to lose a valuable instrument for the furtherance of our economic interests;
41. So far as the United Kingdom\s interests are concerned, it is preferabletherefore that technical aid should be sought ;md given on a bilateral basis and, asregards consultation generally, the truth seems lo be that there is no gap to be filled.The Commonwealth Relations Office and the High Commissioners Offices here and overseas are the normal and, as experience lias shown, satisfactory channels for theprovision of technical aid, and we have already briefly described in this report the considerable mechanism which has been established over the years for the benefitof Colonial territories. In addition, the Commonwealth Liaison Committeeprovides a forum in London for the exchange of information on the economic policies of Commonwealth Governments; it isTiere, for example, that problems of commonwealth concern arising from the scheme for a European Free Trade Areahave been discussed in recent months. In a very different field the commonwealth economic Committee is concerned with the collection and publication of intelli-gence about production, trade and consumption in the Commonwealth.42. We think that there would be substantial difficulty in obtaining theagreement of other Commonwealth Governments to a new body, on grounds bothof principle and of practical utility. We recommend, however, that the scope ofthe present Commonwealth Economic Committee should be widened. TheCommittee, whose functions and constitution are described in more detail inAppendix B, has been in existence since 1925 and is composed of tv/o representativesof each independent Commonwealth country and two representatives of theColonies as a whole. It meets in London under a rotating chairmanship and isfinanced by Commonwealth Governments on an agreed basis. It has a smallsecretariat and produces a large number of factual and analytical publications,providing economic and statistical information on subjects affecting Common-wealth production and trade. In addition, as a result of the commonwealth economic Conference of 1952, it is now engaged on a full survey of Commonwealthresources generally.43. We think that the Committee, in addition to expanding its work oncommodity intelligence, should keep up to date the work which it has been doingon Commonwealth resources generally and should extend its functions to cover thecollation and publication of information about Commonwealth development andits financing. It might also receive and disseminate such information asCommonwealth Governments sent to it about their arrangements for giving eachother technical assistance (though care would need to be taken not to duplicate thework of the Colombo Plan Bureau), this matter might perhaps be explored in the context of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting. In general, we should hope that with the support of Commonwealth Governments the Committee might come to be more widely recognised as a research body of the highest standing forthe examination of any economic problem of common Commonwealth interest which required regular study. There might be occasions on which the UnitedKingdom could properly bring the Committee &quot;s reports specifically to the attentionof individual Commonwealth Governments.F. Atomic Energy in the Commonwealth44. Atomic energy is likely to play an increasingly important part in theeconomic development of Commonwealth countries in the future. In the field of applied nuciear science we are more qualified than any other country to give assistance. It is to our advantage to share our know-how in this field with other commonwealth countries and to assist in particular those which are less advanced in science and engineering to gain knowledge in atomic energy and, when theyare ready for it, to develop atomic energy products in the way best suited to their particular needs. Apart from the economic advantage both to ourselves and tothe Commonwealth, assistance of this kind could illustrate the continuing valueof the Commonwealth connection in a changing world.45. Many Commonwealth countries are already obtaining a considerableamount of advice and technical assistance from us under bilateral arrangements.Indeed training facilities in this country and advice on technical problems areavailable within limits from the United Kingdom Atomic Eneruy Authority(U.K.A.E.A.) for any country which seeks them. The full magnitude of our51679 c 7
present help to the Commonwealth and of the help we are prepared to give is,however, not widely realised either by the Commonwealth Governments or by thegeneral public throughout the Commonwealth. A large proportion of the publicity that is at present given to our contribution to atomic energy in theCommonwealth and to.Commonwealth co-operation in this field is failing to makethe impact that is merited because it is presented in the context of international development. There is a need for more publicity on this subject fccussed onthe Commonwealth aspect.&apos;46. On the other hand our resources of man-power, money and equipment in this field are heavily committed to our own programme and we cannot take on fresh commitments which might jeopardise our position of leadership in atomic energy. The resources available for assisting others are, therefore, strictly limited.Moreover, in our commercial interests, we need to encourage non-commonwealth as well as Commonwealth markets for our atomic energy industry. Account hasalso to be taken of the fact that the Commonwealth countries are all in very different stages of development and that their individual requirements in atomic energy differ, and will differ, widely. Commonwealth countries like Ceylon, ghana and Malaya are not anything like sufficiently far advanced technically to justifyexpenditure on research and power reactors, the prestige attaching to the possessionOf nuclear energy facilities exposes newly-independent countries to the temptation to spend money and effort on facilities which they are at present quite unable touse and which might return no other yield than &quot;frustration.47.   The help we could give falls into the following categories:  (a) We can advise on and offer training facilities in the United kingdom atomic Energy Authority&apos;s establishments and in universities for thescientists and technicians required to establish national atomic projectson a sound footing. Initially the main emphasis for newly independent countries should probably be on training in the use of radiation and- . radioisotopes in the treatment and diagnosis of disease and in theimprovement of agriculture. At a later stage training of pure scientists and of the various specialists needed for local teaching and applicationof nuclear science might be required. Facilities for training in allthese fields are already available to the Commonwealth in this country,but it might be necessary to enlarge these facilities somewhat or to runspecial courses as Commonwealth interest in atomic energy expands.&apos;;. (b) We can offer to help countries establishing or contemplating the; :; establishment of atomic projects to decide on the organisation to be-:&apos; adopted and the objectives and programmes to be set, and to advise. &apos; on the design of laboratories, the selection of equipment, safety: 3; precautions, disposal of effluent, &amp;c.  This is already being done to a!&quot; &quot;: ; v varying extent for some members of the Commonwealth but couldbe extended. Apart from ad hoc visits and discussions, the most effective means would appear to be to attach one or two leadingpeople from the country seeking the assistance to one of theU.K.A.E.A.&apos;s establishments and/or to lend a well-trained scientistfrom the Authority to the new project. (This has already been done on one or two occasions and has proved very effective.)(c) Commonwealth countries not already possessing research reactors and likely to be able to do so, could be encouraged to build their own: .. ;......    research reactors of the simpler type, the Authority supplying the. design, and the fuel and advising on construction problems,.&apos; .. instrumentation, &amp;c. Pakistan is an example of a country which is nearly ready for this and could gain valuable experience in this way.The U.K.A.E.A. are already helping them to explore the possibilitiesof such a project. More generally, we would be ready to provide information on the different types of research reactors and other equipment available especially from the United Kingdom and toadvise on their suitability to the requirements of individualCommonwealth countries and to assist these countries if required intheir negotiations with British industry. In so far as funds areavailable from the United Kingdom &quot;through existing channels ofdevelopment finance to help such purchases, the incentive to look tothe United Kingdom for equipment and guidance would obviously
... be greatly increased. We could consider spending limited sums ongifts of training or research equipment under the Colombo PlanTechnical Co-operation Scheme.(d) We can encourage Commonwealth Governments to come to us for expertguidance on the applicability of nuclear power to conditions in their: ; territories, on the characteristics and likely economics of the different types of power reactor available, and on the possible scale and phasing of a nuclear power programme. There is at present no power reactorof British design available which is suitable for conditions in the lesshighly developed countries, but when such a reactor, designed to producepower competitively (or nearly so) in the range 10-30 megawatts, isdeveloped by the U.K.A.E.A., arrangements might be made to enableengineers from Commonwealth countries to study the prototype andfamiliarise themselves with its use.(e) Apart from information provided in the course of the various forms of guidance and assistance mentioned above, the U.K.A.E.A. could make available to any Commonwealth countries not already receiving themunclassified reports as they become available on atomic energy subjects and bibliographies of works on atomic matters.48. All of the facilities mentioned above already exist to greater or lesser extent and are available to the Commonwealth countries. To varying degrees someof them are already being used by some Commonwealth countries. But the ability of Commonwealth countries to benefit from them varies greatly and for the reasonsindicated in paragraph 46 we should not encourage Commonwealth councries to seek from us facilities which they cannot in fact use. For the same reasons it seemsbest not to try to dress up the facilities summarised in paragraph 47 as a new plan, or indeed as facilities available for all independent of their ability to use them.But there does seem advantage in drawing them together and bringing them anew tothe attention of Commonwealth Governments to remind them of the help which weare already prepared to give and to show that we are, within the limits of our resources, prepared to expand it to meet the individual requirements of eachCommonwealth country.49. In addition consideration might be given to convening periodic informalconferences for technicians at about yearly intervals to keep commonwealth countries informed of the facilities available and to provide an opportunity ofdiscussion of their particular requirements and of recent developments in the atomic energy field. Such conferences might, in due course, lead to an increasing tendencywithin the Commonwealth to co-ordinate mutual assistance in the atomic energyfield. This would be a welcome development but one which can best comenaturally. There are arguments for putting forward such an idea at the PrimeMinisters&apos; conference in the context of a periodic Commonwealth Conference onco-operation in atomic development for peaceful uses.

The following statement of the functions and constitution of theCommonwealth Economic Committee is taken from a note prepared by theCommittee itself.Functions2. The project of an Imperial Economic Committee dates from the ImperialEconomic Conference of 1923. The terms of reference of the Committee, whichwas brought into being in March 1925, were &quot; to consider the possibility of improving the methods of preparing for market and marketing within the UnitedKingdom the food products of the overseas parts of the Empire. . . .&quot;3. The Imperial Conference of 1926 endorsed the work so far done by theCommittee and extended its terms of reference to include also &quot; consideration on behalf of the Governments concerned of (a) a list of rawmaterials for possible further marketing enquiries and (b) suggestions for thepreparation and circulation of brief preliminary surveys of any branch of empire trade and marketing . . . .&quot;4.   The Imperial Conference of 1930 further empowered the Committee:(1) to undertake enquiries into production and marketing in various parts ofthe world of the raw materials enumerated in the Committee^ FifteenthReport (prepared in accordance with item (a) of paragraph 3 above);(2) to carry out any investigations arising out of recommendations of theGeneral Economic Committee and adopted by the Conference;(3) to facilitate conferences among those engaged in particular industries invarious parts of the Commonwealth;(4) to examine and report on any economic question which the Governmentsof the Commonwealth may agree to refer to the Committee.The investigations arising out of recommendations by the General EconomicCommittee of that Conference (item (2) above) concerned (a) the arrangement ofexisting information on the mineral resources of the Commonwealth and (b) an enquiry into the possibility of a common understanding on the principles whichshould determine the distinction between Commonwealth and non-Commonwealthgoods.Arising out of a resolution of the Research Committee of the 1930 Conference,the Committee was empowered to collect and correlate data on the minor forestproducts of the Commonwealth. This work was completed with the issue of an index of Minor Forest Products.5. In pursuance of a Resolution adopted at the Ottawa Conference, 1932, theImperial Committee on Economic Consultation and Co-operation was set up in
1933, under the chairmanship of Dr. Skelton (Canada) to consider means of facilitating economic consultation among Commonwealth countries and to examine&quot; the functions, organisation and financial bases of the (existing) agencies and . . . .what alterations or modifications, if any, in the existing machinery for suchco-operation within the Commonwealth are desirable.&quot;The Commonwealth (then Imperial) Economic Committee was one of the agencies so examined. The &quot; Skelton&quot; Committee^ recommendations were accepted by Governments and came into effect from 1st October, 1933. these recommendations, in respect of the functions of the Committee, were:(1) that the Committee should continue to discharge its existing functions;(2) that it should undertake certain services hitherto performed by the empire marketing Board, namely (a) market intelligence services and (b) worldsurveys of production and trade (including the Commodity Series);(3) that it should be within the competence of the Committee to make proposals to Governments in regard to other economic services andinquiries which, in its view, should be conducted on a co-operative basis;and that, to discharge these functions;(4) its terms of reference should be strengthened where necessary.6. The Imperial Conference of 1937 endorsed the work of the Committee and recommended its continuance with the existing terms of reference but withsomewhat larger resources.7. During the war the Committee&apos;s work was mainly in abeyance but afterthe war, with the agreement of Governments, work was resumed under these termsof reference and they have since remained unchanged.Constitution8. The composition of the Committee as originally constituted provided for four members for the United Kingdom, two for each other member country andtwo for the Colonies, with a Chairman appointed by agreement between governments. In 1926 Southern PJicdesia accepted an invitation to appoint amember.9. The Imperial Conference of 3930 resolved that the Committee shouldcontinue as established, but took note of the desire of the United KingdomGovernment that their representation should be on the same basis as that of otherparts of the Commonwealth. It also recommended that the Chairman should beappointed annually, regard to be paid to the desirability of rotation.10. The report of the Imperial Committee on Economic Consultation andCo-operation (see paragraph 5 above), while maintaining the basic features of theCommittee&apos;s constitution, made far-reaching changes in its organisation. from october 1953 the Committee^ funds (previously furnished by the United Kingdom)were provided by member Governments jointly in proportions recommended bythe &quot; Skelton &quot; Committee and agreed by Governments. These funds, controlledsolely by the Committee, were &quot;&apos; in no way subject to the financial control of anyone Government &quot; (although provision was made by Governments for periodicalreview) and the Committee was given power to appoint and control its own staff.11. The 1937 Imperial Conference approved the continuance of theCommittee as constituted and made provision for separate representation of Burma.12. The Committee resumed work after the war with its constitutionunchanged. Its composition has since been altered, following constitutional changes: (1) by the membership of Burma and the Irish Republic lapsing on their withdrawal from the Commonwealth; (2) by Pakistan and Ceylon acceptinginvitations to assume separate membership and to nominate two members each;(3) by Newfoundland ceasing to have direct representation on becoming a province of Canada.13. The Committee, as now constituted, consists of nineteen members, twoeach nominated by the Governments of Australia, Canada, Ceylon, India, NewZealand, Pakistan, United Kingdom, Union of South Africa, one by theGovernment of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and two by theSecretary of State for the Colonies. Arrangements are in hand for adding Ghanato the membership of the Committee.
