confidential. (57) 13912th June, 1957CABINETRETIRED PAY OF VICE-ADMIRAL HUGHES-HALLETTMemorandum by the First Lord of the admiralty the earlier history of this matter is set out in the then First Lord&apos;smemorandum CP. (55) 56. The Cabinet decided that the Admiral should be leftto seek a remedy in the courts for his claim to damages (CM. (55) 21st Conclusions,Minute 6). Written pleadings were exchanged, but the Treasury Solicitor has now received a letter from the AdmiraFs solicitors, indicating that he is increasinglyloth to proceed with his action. He realises that the publicity might be an acuteembarrassment to the Conservative Party as well as to himself and is also deterredby the possibility that there might be an appeal to the Court of Appeal or even tothe House of Lords involving one side or the other in considerable cost. Theletter goes on to suggest a meeting to explore the possibility of some settlement.2. Both my predecessors were convinced that the case should be kept outof court. Having studied the papers myself, I am convinced that nothing butharm could come from a public hearing of the issues.3. The main witness would be Vice-Admiral Onslow, the officer who, asNaval Secretary to the then First Lord, gave Admiral Hughes-Hallett the wronginformation. He would be compelled to demonstrate with chapter and verse howhe repeatedly misinformed his brother officer on an important matter. I thinkthat this would bring considerable discredit on the Service itself and subject adistinguished officer to a most unpleasant and embarrassing ordeal. It would alsobe highly undesirable to expose the office of Naval Secretary to such publicity ata time when, under the new officer structure, it is acquiring new responsibilities.4. Whatever the legal strength of our position, there is no doubt that onmoral grounds it is extremely weak. Judicial atmosphere, to say nothing of publicopinion, would be against us. Moreover, the advisers of Admiral Hughes-Hallettseem to be under the erroneous impression that it would be in the power of theAdmiralty to award him more retired pay than he is entitled to under theregulations and that we are being parsimonius. Whether or not we are able toremove this impression from their minds, it would no doubt be implanted in thepublic mind by the Press.5. For these reasons, I suggest that the Treasury Solicitor be authorised tonegotiate a settlement at any figure he can achieve up to  2,500 (the full commutedvalue of the difference between the two rates of retired pay being close on  4,000).6. The Lord Privy Seal and I thought that this question might be settledbetween the Ministers concerned and we obtained the agreement of the LordChancellor and the Chief Whip to proceed as proposed above. The Minister ofDefence was happy to let the matter be settled between the Chancellor of the51747Copy No.Printed for the Cabinet. June 1.957
Exchequer, the Attorney-General and myself. The Chancellor of the Exchequer,however, though not necessarily disagreeing with the proposal, has asked that itshould be referred again to the Cabinet.r - 7. The Attorney-General, whom we also consulted, has agreed that the claim should be settled, but not at a higher figure than 50 per cent. He also thinks thatno contribution should be made to the Admiral&apos;s costs. The Attorney-GeneraFsreasons for advising a settlement are different from those to which I have referredand are set out in the following extract from his letter of the 8th April: -&quot; My view that the case should if possible be settled was based on the complications of the legal position and the fact that the costs of litigatingthis matter probably up to the House of Lords would be out of all proportion to the sum involved. My view remains the same but it was not accepted bythe Cabinet.An important principle with implications far more extensive than those relating to the Admiralty alone is raised by this claim, and I am very strongly of opinion that any settlement that is made should not by implication makeit appear that the Crown recognise that there is any validity in the Admirafsclaim.&quot;8. I ask that the Treasury Solicitor be authorised to settle at a figure notexceeding  2,500.SELKIRK.Admiralty, S.W. 1,11th June, 1957.
