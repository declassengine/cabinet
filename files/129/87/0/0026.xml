SECRETWAGES AND PRICESReport by Sir Roger Makins andSir Harold Emmerson on the results of discussions with representatives of industryWe were instructed to undertake exploratory discussions withrepresentatives of industry for the purpose of ascertaining their actions to the proposal to set up a body to report on prices, productionand incomes.   The main points arising in these discussions are recorded in the appendix, and the points on which further considerationby Ministers appears to be necessary are discussed below.Terms of Reference and Title2.      We believe that terms of reference and title on the general lines proposed in our report of 14th May (C,(57) 121) would be most likely tomeet the views which the representatives of industry have expressed.In the light of the discussions with the representatives of industry we now recommend the following -Terms of Reference&quot;Having regard to the desirability of full employment and increasing standards of life based on expanding productionand stable prices, to keep under review changes in productivity,prices and the level of incomes (including wages, salaries and profits) and to report from time to time on the significance ofsuch changes. &quot;Title&quot;The Council on Price Stability, Production and Incomes&quot;.Membership3.      Divergent views have been expressed by the representatives ofindustry about the size and composition of the body, and this is a subject on which it might be desirable for Ministers to keep an openmind and to leave room for variation in the light of their discussions with representatives of industry.   The possibilities are -(i)  a small body composed of three independent persons andwith no industrial affiliations;(ii)  a larger body, say of five members, with at least two whowould be able to speak with knowledge about industrialmatters although they would not be in any sense delegatesfor particular interests;(iii)  a larger body such as Lord Citrine proposed with adequate representation of all main interests involved.While there must be a strong presumption against a large body on grounds of unwieldiness, it would be desirable to leave ample room for manoeuvre on this issue.   This may well be important for securing ameasure of goodwill and co-operation.
4.      We think that the suggestion that the publication of the proposal and the terms of reference should be accompanied by an explanatorystatement (paragraph 1 0 of our note) is a good one.   The terms ofreference would inevitably be short, but the implications might befurther spelt out in such a statement.   For example, &quot;Stable Prices&quot;does not refer only to the cost of living at home, but to the competitive-ness of our prices abroad.   Similarly, the word &quot;productivity&quot; in theterms of reference would give an opportunity of linking the terms ofreference with questions of investment and costs and output.Next Steps5.      If Ministers agreed, the next steps might be to aim atdiscussions at Ministerial level with representatives of industry.   Weemphasised that our discussions were exploratory and without commit-ment, and we think it important, at the next stage also, not to presentindustry with proposals which are completely cut and dried, but to make them feel that a process of genuine consultation is being undertaken andthat they have an opportunity to influence the shape of the proposals.Only in this way is it likely to be possible to secure that degree ofco-operation and goodwill which are needed if this proposal is to havea fair run.   This is especially important in relation to the TradesUnion Congress (T.U.C.) and Ministers may wish to discuss with therepresentatives of the T.U.C. the procedure most suitable for obtaining the views of the Trades Union General Council on the proposal.Publicity6.      We suggest that a Parliamentary Question be arranged andanswered on the lines of paragraph 11 of our note of conversations later on this week or early next week.(Signed)  ROGER MAKINSHAROLD EMMERSON27th May, 1957
APPENDIXWAGES AND PRICESWe saw Sir Tom Williamson and Sir Vincent Tewson,representing the T.U.C., on 22nd May, Sir Colin Anderson andMr. Pollock of the British Employers&apos; Confederation (B.E.C.) andSir Hugh Beaver and Sir Norman Kipping of the Federation of BritishIndustries (F.B.I.) also on 22nd May, and Lord Citrine, Mr. James Bowmanand Sir Brian Robertson (nationalised industries) on 23rd May.   We sawSir Harold Smith (Gas Council), and Mr. Garland (National Union of mineworkers) separately on Monday morning, 27th May.2.      We explained the circumstances in which they had been asked tocome.   There had been a good deal of discussion   about the need to dealwith the problem of how to control inflation in conditions of full employ-ment, and to restrain the upward movement of costs and prices.   this had now been sparked up by the recommendation in paragraph 75 of theReport of the Court of Inquiry on the shipbuilding and engineering dispute.The Government felt that they had to take the initiative in the matter,not least because the ascending complex of costs and prices mightshortly reach a point at which the stability of the currency might be threatened.   The Government thought that the problem went wider thanthe question of wages and prices and an ad hoc procedure had, therefore,been devised under which, without commitment, there would bediscussion with the three branches of industry on an informal basis.There was no question of asking any group to agree to any specificproposal.   The object was to elicit views before the government considered the formulation of a statement.   Meetings at ministerial level with the three branches of industry would be comtemplated before any statement was made.Tt was felt that there must be precise terms of reference, butwe were not yet ready to produce a draft.   We considered, however, thatthe terms of reference should include the objective to be aimed at, andthat they should look towards increased standards of life and expandingproduction based on stable prices and in conditions of full employment.The task of the Committee would be to report from time to time on the movements, or relation between production, prices and the level of earnings (including wages, salaries and profits).   This would coverdividends.   The reports would be of a general character.   It was not contemplated that this body would be a substitute for existing bodiessuch as wage councils or arbitration tribunals.   It would not interveneor express views on specific cases, though it might review them after they had been settled.   Its purpose would be to create a climate ofopinion which would influence the public mind, and also the minds ofthose who were concerned in the discussion and settlement ofparticular problems.   It would have a title which might be Committee,Council or Commission on, say, Production, Prices and Incomes.The body should be small, not fewer than three or more than five, depending to some extent on the relations which it was desired toestablish with the two sides of industry.   Three levels of associationcould be considered.   There might be a membership, through two persons broadly representative of each side of industry.   This wouldmake the Committee five in number.   There might be association,through assessors appointed by both sides of industry, or there might bea correspondence, that is, access to the Commission for the purpose of
presenting views or giving evidence.   The body would be independent,but it would have to draw for much of its information on GovernmentDepartments, particularly the Economic Section of the Treasury andthe Central Statistical Office.   It would need to have a small staff of itsown.    As regards the type of men required, it had first been thoughtthat the Chairman should be a Judge, but it was later thought that a man of general experience might be more suitable.   The body would beregarded as experimental, but it would not be effective unless its members were appointed for a reasonable period, say, three years inthe first instance.   Its reports when issued would clearly formappropriate matter for discussion by existing bodies such as theNational Joint Advisory Council, the National Production AdvisoryCouncil on Industry and the Economic Planning Board.3.     All parties welcomed the opportunity of informal discussion atthe official level before more formal consultation with Ministers.   Onthe substance of the proposal all parties were receptive and very willingto consider and discuss it further.4.      The representatives of the T.U.C, did not raise any objection inprinciple, but they were concerned mainly about the scope of the body and the method of presentation.   They felt that the question should be examined with care and that the Government should proceed with caution.They emphasised that any proposals should be divorced from therecommendation of the Courts of Inquiry and that in presenting any proposals it should be made clear that the matter had been underconsideration before the Courts of Inquiry were set up.   In their view the most appropriate note to strike was that of price stability, and theywould be in favour of concentrating the attention on this one objective.The representatives of the B.E0C. and F.B.I. thought the proposalfor an independent body was worth a trial, though there were obviousrisks to the Government, to employers and to trade unions.   At the least,the proposed body might achieve two important objectives -(a) an improvement of understanding within industry itself of economic factors; and(b) the exercise of an opinion-forming influence in the country generally.The representatives of the nationalised industries thought that a body of the kind proposed would be well worth a trial.All were unanimous in the view that the body should be free andbe seen to be free from governmental interference, and should beallowed in its commentaries to criticise Government action, ifnecessary.   Similarly, all took the view that the usefulness of the proposal in practice would depend substantially upon the goodwill and co-operation of industry, and it was therefore of prime importance thatthere should be full and genuine consultation at the formative stages.The representatives of the employers, both private and nationalised,stressed the importance of securing the goodwill of the T.U.C,Terms of Reference5.     It was agreed that precise terms of reference were needed.   we decided not to produce a draft, but to give a broad indication of thepossible scope of the body and to invite suggestions.   We stressed the
need for mention in the terms of reference of the expansion of production,and this idea was generally welcomed.   The T.U.C. would like the termsof reference to put the main weight on price stability and not to giveprominence to any reference to wages.   They felt also that the body would be more acceptable if the question of investment could be covered.The B.E.C. and F.B.I. doubted the usefulness of specific mention of investment in the terms of reference, but raised no objection to the ideaof including a mention of profits, cr even dividends.Title6.     All were in favour of &quot;Council&quot; rather than &quot;Committee&quot; or&quot;Commission&quot;, and against the use of the word &quot;Advisory&quot; in the title.The T.TJ.C. repeated their point about giving prominence to the idea of price stability.     It was recognised that the title eventually chosenwould depend on the terms of   reference finally adopted.Membership7.      The T.U.C. were inclined in favour of direct representation ofboth sides of industry on the Council and of five members instead ofthree, with two members broadly representing industry.   They werenot attracted by the idea of assessors from industry.   They felt that itwould be advantageous to have a member who would represent theinterests of consumers, for example, somebody with broad experienceof distribution.   The B.E.C. and F.B.I. were on the whole in favour ofa Chairman, with two persons broadly representative of employers andtwo broadly representative of employed.   They felt that unless the bodyincluded persons who were personae gratae with industry they would have little chance of exercising influence.   If, however, it was not possible toreach agreement on a representative body we could fall back on the concept of a Chairman, with two experienced men in the field of, say,economics and accountancy.Divergent views were expressed by the representatives of the nationalised industries.   They only new idea which emerged, however,was a suggestion from Lord Citrine that the body should be enlarged,even beyond five, so as to reflect the divergent views and interests ofthe various parts of industry more fully.All stressed the importance and the difficulty of securingsuitable members.Term of Appointment, Staffing, etc.8.     All were agreed that the body should be appointed for at least three years, and possibly longer, and that it would need a small staff ofits own.Procedure9.      Nothing particular emerged from the discussion on this, but itwas recognised that the modus operandi of the Council would need furtherconsideration when its general  shape and functions had been more clearly delineated.   It would also be necessary, of course, to take theviews of the Chairman into account.
Future Programme10.    We said that a report would be made to Ministers on the informaltalks.   They would then consider the formulation of proposals as abasis for consultation at a higher level.   All parties are anxious thatthey should have a real opportunity of considering any proposal before it is put into final shape.   The T.U.C. suggest that it would be helpful if the publication of the final proposal and the terms of reference couldbe accompanied by an explanatory statement covering the background.Publicity11.   All were agreed that for the time being publicity should be kept to the essential minimum.   On the other hand, the representatives ofindustry recognised that questions might be asked in Parliament aboutprogress.   In answer to such enquiries it was agreed that it might be stated that discussion was continuing within the administration on thethird recommendation of the Courts of Inquiry, but that the ideas in contemplation went rather wider than the Courts of Inquiry had suggested.   To this might be added that in the meantime representativesof industry were being told the lines on which the Government werethinking, and that there would be formal consultations with them in due course.
