DISARMAMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe discussions in the Disarmament Sub-Committee, which havebeen in progress since 18th March, have reached a turning point.Hitherto we have tried to counter Soviet demands for an unconditionalcessation of nuclear test explosions by proposing the registration and limitation of nuclear tests.    Though this proposal was rejected bythe Soviet Government, we were able to justify our position so long,as the Russians refused to accept control over any cessation of nuclear tests.    The situation has now been completely altered by the Sovietostensible acceptance of control over cessation of tests, coupled withthe United States Governmenfs willingness to accept a 10 months1moratorium on tests in certain circumstances.    Given the present stateof public opinion on this subject both at home and abroad, it will now inmy judgment be very difficult for us to continue to stand out against anymoratorium.    And once tests were suspended, even on a temporary basis, it would in practice be very difficult if not impossible to start them up again though the Americans do not hold this view.2.   I am aware of the dangers to our nuclear defence programme whichwould result from a moratorium on all nuclear tests.    This would mean,I understand, that we should be unable to complete our developments of weapons in the kiloton range, and that as regards weapons in the megatonrange, although we should be able to continue to produce them, we should lose the opportunity of developing methods of producing them with lessfissile material.    While therefore we should still possess powerfuldeterrent weapons, we should be seriously handicapped, unless we could persuade the Americans to pass on to us their latest &quot;know-how&quot;.From the point of view of the development of our own weapons it would therefore suit us very much better if there were to be no question of tests being suspended for at least two years.3.   We can, however, obviously not allow a situation to develop inwhich the United States and the Soviet Union had publicly accepted a moratorium on nuclear tests and the United Kingdom - and perhaps Franceappeared as the only obstacles to agreement.    Mr. Stassen, the UnitedStates representative at the Disarmament Talks, has suggested, in a paper attached at Annex A, that the best way out of the difficulty wouldbe to accept the moratorium on tests, but to link this to a first stagedisarmament agreement, including among other points provisions forthe cut-off of production of fissionable materials for weapons purposes.While we must of course continue to strive for a satisfactory and comprehensive disarmament agreement, we cannot escape the fact that unless we were confident of achieving such an agreement, an early cut-offCOPY NOCABINETSECRETC.(57) 14621st June, 1957
date of production would completely disrupt our nuclear defence programme, largely deprive  us of the deterrent and upset the wholebasis on which our present defence planning is based.    It would seriously prejudice the interests of the European members of the North atlantic treaty Organisation and much weaken our own political position.    Theonly way in which these consequences could be avoided1!would be bypersuading the United States to make available to us a sufficientquantity of fissile material, or of completed weapons, to compensate for what we would be unable to produce for ourselves,4,   It is, however, more than likely that the Russians would in factreject any proposals on the lines of Mr. S assen&apos;s paper and that inparticular they would refuse to agree to the necessary measures ofcontrol.    It may be, therefore, that provided the Americans fully appreciate the difficulties of sur own situation there would be no greatrisk in going along with Mr. Stassen&apos;s paper.    In that event, it wouldbe preferable to amend it somewhat, as shown in Annex B, in order tobring out its meaning more clearly.    The French, who are even moreinsistent than the other Western Powers on the link between tests and nuclear disarmament, are likely to agree to the Stassen suggestion andthere are, of course, obvious advantages in our keeping as closely aspossible in line with them and the Americans.    Past experience indisarmament discussions has shown how important it is to achieve and maintain a united Western front against the Russians.    Furthermore,should be eventually have to seek assistance from the United States inthe way of fissile material, finished weapons or know-how, our chances of success will be greater if we have co-operated with them fullythroughout the present negotiations.5.   However, if the Russians reject a Four Power proposal on thelines of the Stassen paper, it is certain that they will continue to insist that there should be agreement on a suspension of tests without waiting for agreement on other measures of a first stage disarmament plan.They will claim that tests should be treated as a separate problem.In that event, both we and the United States Government will be undersevere pressure to accept the suspension on tests as an isolated issue.It is very likely that in such circumstances the next session of theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations in the autumn will pass aresolution calling for such a suspension.     If that happens it will be verydifficult for us, depending a little on the American attitude, to stand out against a recommendation to this effect.    This is a further reason forour accepting Mr. Stassen*s proposal, as in his view and ours thisshould hold the position in the General Assembly.recommendation.    On balance it is the British and American view that the situationin the General Assembly will be eased by a joint statement of theWestern position on the lines of Annex B, even if the Russians have turned it down.    I therefore recommend that we should inform mr. Stassen that we will support his proposal in the revised form at annex B.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.1.21st June, 1957.
ANNEX BSUGGESTED FOUR-POWER DRAFT on nuclear TESTSThe Delegations of Canada, France, the United Kingdom andthe United States welcome the acceptance by the Delegation of the U.S.S.R.of the requirement of inspection posts with appropriate scientificinstruments, equipment, and facilities, to be set up for the purposes ofcontrol and detection of nuclear testing.    This is an essential requirementwhich the four Delegations had long proposed and upon which they had insisted.     They note that the Soviet Union proposes that these inspectionposts should be located within the territories of the U.S.S.R., U. S, ,U. K. and Pacific Ocean areas.2.        Soviet acceptance of this principle now brings within the realmof possibility a temporary suspension of nuclear testing as part of anagreement for a first step in disarmament.    This temporary cessationwould be subject, of course, to precise agreement on its duration and timing, on the installation^ and location (with, of course, the consent ofthe countries concerned) of the necessary controls, includinginspection posts, and on its relationship to other provisions of a first stage agreement.    These provisions would include the first steps tohalt the growth of armaments and to reverse the trend by-initialreductions in armed forces and designated armaments, with the necessary the Delegations of Canada, France, United Kingdom, andthe United States welcome the acceptance by the Delegation of theU.S.S.R. of the requirement of inspection posts with appropriatescientific instruments, equipment, and facilities, to be located withinthe territories of the U.S.S.R., U.
