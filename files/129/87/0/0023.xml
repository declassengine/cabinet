THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1957CONFIDENTIAL i Copy No; 52C (57) 12317th May, 1957.   CABINETTRAINING OF TEACHERSMemorandum by the Minister of EducationLast week I submitted to the Home Affairs Committee a proposal that thecourse in the general teacher training colleges should be lengthened from two to three years for students entering in 1960. This means that for one year there willbe no output from the training colleges and that, since I do not propose to enlargethe training college plant, the annual output from the colleges will thereafter bereduced by one-third. I can defend the reduction in output by pointing to the fallin the school population in the 1960s.      r . j2. My colleagues accepted that the course should be lengthened but some ofthem wished the change to be brought forward to 1959 (H.A. (57) 12th Meeting,Item 1).3. The argument for doing this is financial: the saving of  15 million onteachers&apos; salaries over five years which this would yield is, it was argued, moreimportant than the worsening of the average size of primary classes during 1961from 31 -2 to 31 -6 which introduction in 1959 would entail. My proposal avoidsthis because 1962 will be both the year when there is no output of teachers from thetraining colleges and the year when the fall in the school population is greatest.This is set out in full in the Appendix.4. The deterioration in class sizes may seem insignificant, but it would mean that over 100,000 more, children than in 1960 would be in over-large classes; Itwould also reverse the trend of improvement which has already begun.5. It would be impossible to conceal these consequences of introduction in1959. There is already great concern about the present very considerable numberof over-large classes and the Opposition and educational opinion (which is uneasyabout the general grant) would seize upon such a decision as a concealed economymove. They would throw in our teeth the repeated declarations of our intentionto reduce the size of classes and we should lose the credit we would otherwise getfor an educational reform.6. The ending of national service would make introduction in 1959, even moreunpopular. The demand for training college places for men will be inflated in thatyear while the number of vacancies would be reduced by a third. I hope to meetthe legitimate demands of these men by &quot; crowding up,&quot; but if we introduced thethree-year course in 1959 pressure for permanent increases in the training collegeplant, which I would otherwise hope to avoid, would in my judgment becomeirresistible.7. I would, therefore, urge my colleagues most strongly to agree that thethree-year course should be introduced in September 1960.HAILSHAM.Ministry of Education, W. 1.16th May, 1957.51631
