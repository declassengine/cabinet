Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1957SECRET Copy No.C (57) 14926th June, 1957. &apos;cabinet anglo-INDIAN relations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations my colleagues will have seen the recent series of despatches from our HighCommissioner in India, Mr. MacDonald, on relations with the United Kingdom(C.R.O. Prints of 1st and 14th May and 14th June). As the affairs of thesub-continent are going to be of increasing concern to the United Kingdom inthe political and economic fields I thought I should circulate this short commentaryupon them.2. Undoubtedly there is room for improvement in relations between Indiaand this country, but this cannot be a unilateral operation. If there is to beimprovement, we are entitled to ask for quite a lot of help from India. The gapthat exists stems from causes which cannot be removed in a day. They are:  (i) the Indian policy of neutrality;(ii) Indian hostility to the Bagdad Pact and to what it stands for;(iii) the sharp divergence of view between us and India about armaments and nuclear warfare;(iv) the Kashmir dispute.In addition, and more temporarily,(v) we have to reckon with Mr. Krishna Menon and his activities over Suez,Hungary and Kashmir which have worked up opinion here againstIndia.3. -I have no doubt that India&apos;s permanent interest lies in keeping a footfirmly in the Western camp. Russia and China are too dangerous for her to dootherwise. But for some time to come the difficulties which I have listed will bein the foreground and it will take time and patience to work our way out of themand towards a change of emphasis in lndia&apos;s foreign policy and through that in her attitude towards the West.4. Meanwhile we must certainly do our part. In the economic field we are trying our best, in face of extravagant requests, to help India by technical advice,&amp;c. But there is a very definite limit, because of our lack of financial resources,to what we can do.5. In defence we are again trying to help at considerable inconvenience to ourselves: first with Canberras and now over Hunters, as recently requested byMr. Menon. But India will have to pay for these, and difficulty may arise over that.I rather expect them to say that they cannot pay unless we lend them the money and to hold the threat of purchase from Russia over our heads.6. In the general constitutional field (for instance on advance to commonwealth status), we see pretty well eye to eye and although India lines up with the anti-Colonialists, she has not been unhelpful on Kenya or Cyprus. Ianticipate some trouble over the Central African Federation^ application for full commonwealth status but that, I hope, lies some years ahead.7. For the present the main obstacles to closer understanding are listed inparagraph 2 and since some of them vitally concern our defence policy,considerations of security forbid more than very restricted consultation. It is just51807
not possible to give the Indians information with the, same freedom as we can toother Commonwealth countries and the best we can do is to keep the relationsbetween our services and the Indian services as close as possible. At present theyare good.8. Mr! MacDonald makes certain specific suggestions (see Annex) and we will follow up all of them and adopt such as are practical. They will not amountto very much, but they will help to keep relations reasonably cordial. We will loseno opportunity to assure India of our wish for the closest co-operation; but I fear that until there is a change of emphasis in her foreign and defence policies ourfriendship will not be intimate.H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1.24th June, 1957.
:.      .v :0.;.-.:-: .&apos;        .-   ANNEX      &apos; ^    \-: r&apos;v-vj;a -.r...SUGGESTIONS IN Mr. MacDONALD&apos;S DESPATCH OF 28th MAY for improving ANGLO-INDIAN RELATIONS(a) We should pay greater heed to the views Of the Asian nations generally,and make efforts to reach accommodations on policy with them consistent withour purpose to; promote the democratic cause against Communism.Comment *&apos;\-:&apos;&quot;s;&apos;&apos;      /        &apos;;:&apos;fV&quot;.- &apos;      &quot; -&apos;v,V.&apos;,V. ..V,-,V&apos;-&apos;VJIn principle, this is of course acceptable. But in practice the HighCommissioner under-estimates the difference of view between the bagdad pact nations and India in the political field, the sharp clash between Indiaand Pakistan and the degree of our own disagreement with India on anumber of major issues such as disarmament and nuclear warfare.(b) Without sacrificing our good relations with Pakistan and other Asian allies,we should attempt especially to improve understanding and co-operation with Indiabecause of her outstanding importance.CommentI agree that it is fundamental that we should keep our good relationswith Pakistan and our other Asian allies, who are so important to us, inthe Middle East and in South Asia. That reservation greatly takes fromthe degree of progress we can hope to make with India. Anxious as weare, because of the outstanding importance of India, to improve our understanding and co-operation with her, India must help. At the. moment, any overtures made are entirely one-sided, and I see little prospect of her doing much at present to improve that state of things.(c) With a view to improving understanding and co-operation with India, weshould review the fields in which we inform and consult India on internationalpolicy and expand these as far as possible.CommentWe will certainly review the position. But the divergences of major policy between us and the risk of leakage are likely to be grave practicalobstacles to a great deal being done.(d) Our aim should be to encourage by such consultation the development where United Kingdom and Indian attitudes are inevitably different ofcomplementary rather than conflicting policies.CommentI see no objection. This should be our general aim.(e) We should maintain our policy of giving every practical help to India&apos;second Five-Year Plan for economic and social development.CommentWe are very anxious to help India in every practical way, and we havegiven her advice, technical aid, &amp;c. But the Chancellor of the Exchequer^present difficulties put it out of the question for us to give or lend her any great sum of money, and we have in any case to consider the competing claims of other and possibly more friendly parts of the Commonwealth.(/) We should extend our activities in the information services, B.B.C. andBritish Council fields.CommentWe can wholeheartedly accept this and recent decision will help.(g) We should stimulate visits to India by distinguished Britons in cultural,political and other fields.CommentThis is also entirely acceptable and the Commonwealth ParliamentaryAssociation delegation will have a useful opportunity this year.
(h) Above all, a visit by Her Majesty The Queen and Prince Philip would achieve great good.CommentSome consideration was given to this at an earlier stage. Any visitwould have to be to Pakistan as well as to India. Much would in any casedepend on the political relations- between us and India at the time;suggested^-all the more difficult because such long notice and planning,are involved in Royal Visits. But (once the Mutiny year is over, and her majesty&apos;s engagements permit) this is a possibility which might beconsidered in relation to both countries. I would not press forconsideration now.
