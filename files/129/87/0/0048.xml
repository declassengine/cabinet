-    289THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 14821st June, 1957CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT finance memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentand Minister for Welsh affairs attach, for the approval of the Cabinet, a draft White Paper setting out in further detail the results of review of local government finance. It needs to besettled urgently, for publication in time for a combined debate (before the Houserises for the summer recess) not only on this subject but also on the kindred questionsof Areas and Status of Local Authorities and Functions of County Councils and county District Councils, on which White Papers have been published already.2. It embodies suggestions for improvement following examination of an earlier draft by the Home Affairs Sub-Committee on Local government organisation and Finance (HA. (LG) (57) 3rd Meeting, Item 1) and a final meeting with the representatives of local authorities which I held on 19th June. Officiallythe representatives reserved their position, except those from the London CountyCouncil who declared their opposition to the general grant on the ground that itwould penalise a progressive and pioneering authority such as theirs. But themeeting went sufficiently well to assure me that there is a real prospect of winningat least the goodwill and even the tacit support of the associations representingall the other authorities, if only we can satisfy them on certain points.3. The main outstanding question is the amount of the reduction inExchequer grants which is to accompany re-rating. The Cabinet decided that itwould be necessary to maintain at the outset that the whole of the product of re-rating should accrue to the Exchequer, but to be prepared, during the subsequent negotiations with the local authorities, to make some concession on this point(C.C. (57) 9th Conclusions, Minute 2). The general feeling in the Home AffairsSub-Committee on 18th June (the position of the Chancellor of the Exchequer being reserved) was that some concession would be necessary and that the effects of alternative concessions of  5 millions,  10 millions and  15 millions should bebefore the Cabinet when they considered this matter. The representatives of thelocal authorities maintained that they should be entitled to  15 millions. This isthe crux of the matter, coupled with the possible effect of changes in highway grants which are not yet settled.4. The exemplification for counties and county boroughs which is at the endof the draft White Paper is on the basis that the full cut of  30 millions is enforced;and Table I of this Memorandum, summarising the range of estimated losses andgains for all local authorities, is on that same basis. But Tables II, III and IV show the approximate effect of a concession which left  5 millions,  10 millions or 15 millions respectively to be enjoyed by the local authorities in the relief of their rates (assessing the effect on general grant and equalisation grant taken together).5. It must not be forgotten that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has already accepted the principle of paying the new general grant within the year to which it relates, subject to the qualification that the change may need to be made by stages.51789 b
In effect, this involves accelerating a once-for-all payment of  30 millions; and thelocal authorities raised no objection to the principle of making the change by stages,i.e., not charging the Budget with an extra  30 millions all in one year. What was originally in mind was that the change should be spread over two years, but I would accept a longer period if this would help the Chancellor to agree to a usefulconcession on the cut in grants; for though I have sought to hold the positionrigidly for the Treasury throughout all the negotiations, now that they are completed I am certain that a material concession is essential if this scheme is to beput through. I suggest for the consideration of the Cabinet that we should make a concession of  15 millions; that we announce our willingness to do this; that 10 millions of it should be made in the general and equalisation grants, and thatthe disposition of the other  5 millions be held in reserve for settlement when theeffect of the highway changes, on which the Minister of Transport is still negotiating,can be seen.6. A decision of this character will, in my judgment, secure pretty general support for our plan as a whole, among the leading people in local governmentoutside London. It will transform criticism into appreciation. What is however inmy eyes equally important, it will greatly increase the number of individual localauthorities which will in the end gain by the Governments proposals, and diminish the number which will in the end lose, as perusal of Tables I-IV shows. I considerthat, if we were to make no concession, the scheme as a whole however rationalfinancially would be politically impossible.H.

LOCAL GOVERNMENTFINANCEPresented by the Minister of Housing and Local Government to parliament by Command of Her Majesty1957LONDONHER MAJESTVS STATIONERY OFFICEnetGmnd.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE1. This Paper dealing wkh finance is the third and last of the white papers setting out the Government^ proposals for local government inEngland and Wales. The first of these, dealing with Areas and Status ofLocal Authorities/1&apos; was presented in July, 1956 ; and in May, 1957, therefollowed a White Paper on Functions of County Councils and County district councils.(2) Both these White Papers have been under discussion with therepresentatives of local authorities, following which the Government have inmind certain changes in their original- proposals which will be announced in due course. These changes do not, however, affect the general approach;and with the publication of this Paper on finance the range of the Govern-ment&apos;s proposals for the reorganisation of local government in England andWales can be appreciated. It is their intention to introduce legislationcovering the contents of all three White Papers.2. The former Minister of Housing and Local Government announcedearly in 1956 that a comprehensive review of local government finance wasbeing undertaken ; and he explained, in reply to a Question in the Houseof Commons on 8th May, 1956, that this review was the most thoroughof its kind since 1929. Valuable research and investigation into the subject had been undertaken simultaneously by voluntary bodies, including twostudies of the first quality the results of which, in advance of publication inbook form, were made available to the Government before their own con-clusions were reached. These are the Report of a Study Group of the RoyalInstitute of Public Administration on New Sources of Local Revenue, anda Research Study set on foot by the Institute of Municipal Treasurers andAccountants on Local Expenditure and Exchequer Grants.3. The Governmenfs main conclusions were announced by the presentMinister of Housing and Local Government in the House of Commons on12th February, 1957, preparatory to detailed discussions with the associations of local authorities and other organisations affected. In brief, the Govern-rnent do not think it practicable to devise a satisfactory new source of localrevenue by authorising the collection of a local income tax or other suchimpost on top of the national system of taxes ; nor do they think it appropriate to earmark for the direct benefit of local authorities, or to hand over to them,the motor duties or any other of the taxes now levied nationally. In their view, improvement of the system of local finance in this country must comefrom improvement of the system of local taxation which is traditionally theright of local authorities, combined with a radical recasting of the systemof grants. The kind of improvement in grants which is needed is one whichsecures that a substantially larger part of the grant-aid is in the form ofgeneral assistance and is not tied (as is so much of the present Exchequeraid) to specific services and expressed as a percentage of expenditure upon these services. The present system of percentage grants acts as an indis-criminating incentive to further expenditure and also carries with it anaggravating amount of central checking and control of detail. The following paragraphs explain the Governments proposals to secure the improvementrequired.4. Since the statement made on 12th February a Working Party con-sisting of representatives of central Departments and of local government hasexamined the proposals in detail, and the Government is indebted to themfor a number of valuable technical changes for the better. The detailed proposals have been discussed with the representatives of local authorities,(&apos;) Cmd. 9831.       (2) Cmnd. 161.3
who have expressed views on various points, and these have been takeninto consideration by the Government. The local authority representativesasked that this White Paper should make clear that, by participating in theWorking Party and the discussions, they were not to be taken as committed to the whole scheme.  On this they reserved their attitude.5. A main aim of the proposed changes has been to increase theindependence of local authorities in the raising and the spending of their money so far as it is practicable to do so. Since the First Report of theLocal Government Manpower Committee in December, 1949,(1&apos; it has beena declared objective of Governments to simplify and reduce Departmentalcontrol, on the view that &quot; local authorities are responsible bodies com-petent to discharge their own functions and . . . they exercise their responsibilities in their own right ... It follows that the objective shouldbe to leave as much as possible of the detailed management of a scheme or service to the local authority and to concentrate the Department^ controlat the key points where it can most effectively discharge its responsibilities for Government policy and financial administration &quot;. The grant changesoutlined below are an important step for this accepted purpose. The repre-sentatives of local authorities have suggested that since the object of theGovernment is to strengthen the independence of local authorities, theopportunity should be taken to carry out a fresh review of the controls which the central Government exercise over local government (a reviewincluding but not limited to the controls associated with the grant strucure).The Government accept the proposal and are arranging for a reviewaccordingly.6. While grants and rates (in that order) are the two main constituentsof local finance, the contribution made by charges for licences, fees and othermiscellaneous income is appreciable and must not be overlooked. In so faras such charges are statutory and have not been revised in tune with modern conditions, the legislation may need to be amended when opportunity offers.That is not further examined here.PROPOSALS FOR STRENGTHENING THE RATING SYSTEMRe-rating7. At present industry and freight-transport are rated at 25 per cent oftheir net annual value. They will toe re-rated to 50 per cent of net annual value ; and corresponding alterations will be made as regards industrialproperties occupied by the Crown.The Rating of Plant and Machinery8. The rating of plant and machinery is governed by the provisions ofSection 24 of the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, the Third Schedule tothat Act, and the Plant and Machinery (Valuation for Rating) Order, 1927,made under these provisions. Changes in industrial practice in the lastthirty years have, however, rendered the Order out of date in variousrespects. A committee is therefore being invited to prepare a revised Orderon the principles laid down in the Third Schedule ; and it will be the aim tocomplete this revision by the date that re-rating and other changes comeinto operation.(&apos;) Cmd. 7870.4
Rate Payments and Payments in Lieu of Rates by the Nationalised Industries9. The payments made by the nationalised gas, electricity and transport industries will all be included in the rating system. Electricity propertieswill be rated on lines similar to those now operating for gas, with weightingsfor generation and distribution as outlined in Annex A. Those parts ofelectricity and gas showrooms used as shops will be separately and directlyassessed to rates ; and the transport payments distributed by the Ministryof Housing and Local Government will all be made to the rating authorities(and not partly to county councils) and treated in all respects as rates. (the gas and electricity payments will actually be rates.) These proposals arefurther outlined in Annex B.The Burden of Rates10. One of the difficulties in the rating system is that the rate demand is made half-yearly upon some ratepayers (although many pay their rateswith the rent at weekly or monthly intervals). Greater efforts are needed tomeet the convenience of the payers in the way of instalment paymentetc. for those who are faced with half-yearly demands for rates. Taxes arenow accepted by instalments; and rating authorities should considerenlarging and publicising their arrangements for paying rates by instalments.Responsibility to the Ratepayers11. It is, as already explained, a purpose of the changes to give localauthorities greater freedom in the spending of their money. This will makeit more than ever important that they should fully explain their policies to their own electorate, and should ensure that their ratepayers can readilyunderstand the financial effects.12. To make more readily apparent to the ratepayers on the face ofthe demand note the extent to which the rating authority and the variousprecepting authorities are severally responsible for the rate burden, therequirements relating to demand notes will be revised. More than thisis needed, however, if all concerned are to understand what it is that their local authority is doing on their behalf, since a varying but substantial proportion of the ratepayers, who pay their rates with their rent, donot even receive the demand note and are in consequence often ill-informed about local rates. How best to convey to these and other ratepayers thepurpose and the cost of local government is not a matter which can besettled centrally. It varies with local conditions; and the problem is onewhich each local authority should consider for its area.REORGANISATION OF THE SYSTEM OF GRANTS13. While a greater measure of local financial independence is a primary purpose of the changes in the grant system, the Government must still remain responsible for laying down national policy and for ensuring com-compliance with basic standards in the several services which are aided bygrants. Controls for this purpose will be limited to the &quot; key points &quot; ofa service, which, in the deliberations of the Local Government ManpowerCommittee (see paragraph 4), were recognised to be properly the responsibilityof the central Department. Though for this purpose basic standards maybe prescribed to the maximum local discretion will be given in the methodof providing the service: the reward of efficiency will accrue wholly tothe benefit of the local population.
14. As was explaiaed in the announcement on 12th February, it isproposed to replace as many as practicable of the specific grants (whichare mostly on a percentage basis) by a general grant of an amount fixed in advance for a short period of years, though not necessarily at the same level for each year of the period. If the service is developing and for this or any other reason a rising level of expenditure must be anticipated, theamount to be distributed by way of general grant will increase from yearto year. This general grant will be distributed to all county and countyborough councils by reference to objective factors (mainly of weightedpopulation) which are readily ascertainable and afford a fair and reasonablemeasure of the relative needs of each authority.15. At their present levels, the specific grants to be absorbed into thegeneral grant total nearly  300 millions. Taking into account the equalisation-tion grants, grants-in-aid which are general in character (as distinct fromgrants tied to specific services) will rise from one-sixth to close on two-thirds of all Exchequer assistance.16. The grants to be absorbed into the general grant are those for education (but not school milk and meals)agricultural educationhealth services under the National Health Service Act, 1946firechild caretown planning (but not grants to which s. 51 (2) of the Town and country planning Act, 1954, applies)road safetytraffic patrolsregistration of electorsphysical training and recreationresidential and temporary accommodation under the National AssistanceAct, 1948school crossing patrols.17. In respect of advanced technological education and a wide range of further education (comprising all courses beginning above the level ofGGE. Advanced or Ordinary National Certificate), the expenditure willbe pooled (as that for the training of teachers has long been and will con-tinue to toe) and shared between all local education authorities. Thesepooling arrangements acknowledge the non-local character of much of this expenditure. With the inclusion of these arrangements it will not be neces-sary (as earlier intended) to exclude advanced technology from the servicescovered by the general grant.18. In the first instance the grant period will be two years, though theamount will not necessarily be the same for each year. The total of thegrant for each year of a period, with the relative weightings which govern the distribution, will be decided toy the Government (after discussion withthe associations of local authorities) and announced by White Paper. Thefigure will then toe embodied in an Order, made under the legislation to been acted, determining the statutory amount which the Government may ask parliament at the appropriate time in each year of the period to vote inthe ordinary way. In the discussions the local authorities have stressed thatthey do not regard all the grants toeing incorporated in the general grant
as adequate, and also that there may be some services which in their opinion should be grant-aided, but are not at present. The Government will beprepared to consider representations on these points at any time.19. The services concerned are not static ; and it will be necessary toprovide for their further development. In determining the total of thegeneral grant for any period the Government will take into consideration (a) the latest available figures of expenditure by local authorities onthe relevant services ;(b) such factors beyond the control of local authorities and occurringgenerally in the country as are expected to affect materially thedemands on the local authorities in respect of the relevant services in the period;(c) the need for development of the services, and at the same time thegeneral state of the economy, as determining the amount of improve-ment which can properly be secured in the period.20. The amount of the grant will take into account the levels of remunera-tion and prices current at the time, together with any foreseeable variations.The Government appreciate, nevertheless, that there may be unforeseenincreases during the grant period of such magnitude that they cannot reason-ably ibe carried in full by the local authorities. In this event the Governmentwill be prepared by way of exception to consider interim revision of thegrant.21. As the general grant is fixed in total, and its distribution is regulated by objective factors without regard for the expenditure of the individuallocal authority, it will not be necessary, as it is now, to withhold a percentageof the grant until the amount of the expenditure which ranks for grantis known. Approximately  30 millions is involved. The government propose to pay the full amount of the general grant for each year in thatyear, but it may be necessary to reach this position by stages.22. The formula for the general grant is set out in Annex C.Equalisation Grants23. So far as equalisation grants are concerned, this review is that required under section 14 of the Local Government Act, 1948, which provides for periodical investigations of the operation of the system.24. The operation of these grants was investigated by a Committee in1953(1). The changes now proposed are in the main based on the recom-mendations of 1953, but take account of the altered circumstances, including those consequent upon the proposals for a general grant. They areelaborated in Annex D. Perhaps the proposal of the widest general interest is that to pay some part of the grants (renamed rate deficiencygrants) direct to county district councils.Highway Grants25. The Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation is engaged in dis-cussions with the representatives of local authorities on proposals for a revised basis of distribution of the highway grants. The effects cannot yet be assessed ; but any gains and losses resulting will be taken into account in operating the transitional scheme described in paragraphs 32 and 33.(&apos;) Report of the Committee appointed to investigate the operation of the ExchequerEqualisation Grants in England and Wales, 1953.

The incidence of all these various changes on the local authoritieseligible causes a reduction in equalisation grants (now to be known asrate deficiency grants) of the order of (        millions).   Allowing for the26. The total of grants has in recent post-war years for the first timeovertaken the total of rates, and become the major element in local govern-ment finance. The proportion of grants to rates is now as 6 is to 5,and it is still increasing. It is most important to reduce this dependence of local government on Exchequer grants if it can possibly be done.27. Since before World War II, indirect taxes have grown in yieldfive-fold and direct taxes six-fold. Rates in the same period have doubled,while incomes (net of income tax and surtax) have on an average nearlytrebled. Apart from a temporary feature in the withholding of rates onincreases following the revaluation pending the determination of appeals,rates are comparatively easy to collect: arrears and irrecoverables areappreciably less than before the war.28. While re-rating increases the product of rates it has the direct effectof reducing the product of income tax, profits tax and surtax. It is plain,therefore, that some reduction of grants must accompany the re-rating ; andin view of the considerations in the preceding paragraphs there is a strong case for a reduction equivalent to the total product of re-rating.29. The estimated product of re-rating is of the order of  30 millions a year, of which about half will be at the expense of the Exchequer. Inview, however, of the representations made by local authorities, the Govern-ment have decided that the reduction of grants should be limited to ( 15millions) ( 20 millions) ( 25 millions). There will therefore be from theGovernment^ proposals a total net gain to local government of ( 15 millions)( 10 millions) ( 5 millions) a year.The Method of Reducsng the Grants30. The grants system is a haphazard growth of subventions great and small. It is proposed to take this opportunity to sweep away sundry smallseparate grants and thereby make an effective saving in accounting andauditing manpower centrally and locally. The grants which it is intendedto abolish, with their estimated value in 1956-57, are as follows:  Total grants for Year
amounts referred to in the preceding paragraph there will be a balance of(        millions) to be taken off the total of the general grant.[Note. The amount by which equalisation grants will be reduced will vary according to the size of the cut of the grants. Assuming a cut of  20 millions theequalisation grants will be reduced by  1 If millions, leaving  6f millions to come offthe general grant.]Transitional Arrangements32. All these changes may entail gains and losses for individual ratingareas; but as there will be an overall gain to local government thenumber of areas which gain will be (much) larger than the number whichlose. The effect on the rates of the losers (when it ultimately comes tobe borne by them) is not in general likely to raise their rates above theaverage level for England and Wales as a whole, and in any event theGovernment propose a transitional scheme which will ensure that both thegains and losses take effect gradually. This will be done by financing grants to the losers out of gains temporarily withheld, to the extent necessary,from the gainers.33. The result of gain or loss will be assessed by reference to thefigure of the latest practicable period before the new provisions begin to operate. Any loss so assessed will in the first year of the new arrangements(1959-60) be made good up to 100 per cent ; and in the second year(1960-61) to the extent of 90 per cent. Changes resulting from the newrevaluation provided for under existing legislation in 1961 may entail some adjustment; but, subject to that, the proportion of the losses made goodwill go down step by step to nil in the following years. The time to betaken in arriving at the final position will be further considered when thefull effects of all the relevant factors can be seen with precision.34. The full effect of all the changes cannot be evaluated until the alterations in the distribution of highway grants are settled. In the exemplifi-cation which follows, however, the effect of all the other changes is estimated for county boroughs and for counties (expressed as an average rate for thecounty) on the basis of 1956-57 figures. These changes include the sub-stitution of a general grant for most of the important specific grants, there-rating of industry and freight-transport to 50 per cent, with a reductionof grants in total by ( 25 millions) ( 20 millions) ( 15 millions), as ifthese changes had operated in 1956-57; but to make the picture more realistic the rateable values for 1st April, 1957, have been used as the starting point of the calculations ; this brings in the effect of the rating concessionsfor commercial and other properties under the Rating and Valuation Act,1957.35. It will be appreciated from what has been said in paragraphs 32and 33 that a local authority which is shown as suffering a loss wouldnot be called upon to bear the whole of this loss for several years afterthe new arrangements began to operate, and in the first year of the new arrangements it woidd bear no loss at all.DATE OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES36. All the changes would be designed to come into force together as from 1st April, 1959. So far as the general grant is concerned, thelegislation to be introduced next Session would provide for the basis ; butit could not fix the total of the grant for the first period or the weightgiven to the various items in the formula. As indicated in paragraph 18,these (and also those for subsequent periods) will be announced in good
time before the beginning of the period by White Paper, and embodied in anOrder made under the Act. The grants for the first period will be decided by the Government (after discussion with the associations of local authorities)in the late autumn or winter of 1958 by reference to the latest availablefigures.Conclusion37. As indicated earlier, successive Governments since the war havesubscribed to a policy of giving greater freedom to local authorities from central control. But it has not yet been made a sufficient reality. TheGovernment understand the anxieties of those concerned for the develop-ment of particular local government services who fear that, without the stimulus of specific percentage grants, some local authorities may not spendupon these services as much as they otherwise would. But the government believe that the best contribution they can make towards improving thequality of local government services is to improve the quality of localgovernment; and they are convinced that greater independence and freedom from detailed central control is essential to this. They believe that thesefinancial proposals, taken together with the proposals for re-organisation,will give to local authorities a new opportunity for responsible and worth-while work; and they are confident that local authorities will respond tothe opportunity.ANNEX AThe Rating of Electricity Properties1. The payment in lieu of rates by the electricity industry will be converted into rateable value. This rateable value will be reduced by the estimated amountof the net annual values of the offices of the Electricity Council and of the parts of electricity showrooms used for the purposes of a retail shop. (Thesepremises will be separately rated in the normal way.) Half of the reducedrateable value will be apportioned to the Generating Board. The other half willbe apportioned among the Area Boards in proportion to the amounts whichthey contributed to the total of the electricity payments in lieu of rates for the six years 1951-52 to 1956-57. (These conversions, adjustments and apportion-ments will be made once for all;)2. The rateable value of the Generating Board will be adjusted annually by increasing or decreasing it by one-fifth of the proportionate increase or decreasein the number of units supplied to Area Boards or sold by the GeneratingBoard direct to consumers in England and Wales in the penultimate year ascompared with a base year.3. The rateable value of an Area Board will be adjusted annually by increasing or decreasing it by one-fifth of the proportionate increase or decreasein the net number of units purchased or generated for sale by that Board to consumers in the penultimate year as compared with that number in a baseyear.4. In each year, half the rateable value of the Generating Board will be apportioned on the basis of generating capacity among rating areas in whichthere are situated generating stations belonging to the Board. The other halfwill be shared among all rating areas in proportion to the net annual values forthe areas.5. Area Boards may in future undertake the generation of electricity. Theiractivity, if any, in this field is likely to be very small. If a Board does under-take generation, the rating area will be allocated the same rateable value in any year for the generating station as if ,the generating station were being operated by the Generating Board, and that rateable value will be a first charge againstthe rateable value of the Area Board.
6. In each year the rateable value of an Area Board (less any rateable valueallocated under paragraph 9) will be shared among rating areas in the Board&apos;sarea in proportion to the net annual values for those areas. (Where an area board&apos;s boundary runs through a rating area the valuation officer will for thispurpose apportion the net annual value for the rating area between the Boards.)7. The Generating Board and each Area Board will be rated in the ordinary way except that they will not be liable for additional items of the general ratelevied in part only of a rating area.8. These proposals have been taken into account in the tables in Annex E,except that the separate rating of Electricity Council offices and of parts ofshowrooms has been disregarded, since their assessments are not yet known.Approximate figures of net annual values as at 1st April, 1956, have been used,with estimated apportionments between Area Boards where necessary. (Seeopening words to paragraph 34.)ANNEX BOther Proposals in respect of the Rate Payments of the nationalised industries. Paragraph 9 of the Paper summarises the main changes in the arrange-ments for rate payments by the nationalised industries : and Annex A deals indetail with the proposals for rating electricity properties. The other proposals in this field are as follows.2. The formulae for gas contained in the Rating and Valuation (miscellaneous provisions) Act, 1955, will be amended so that, in the annual adjustment of thetotal, sales of gas purchased by a Board have only half the weighting of sales of gas manufactured ; and, in the apportionment among rating areas, gas pro-cessed is given half the weighting of gas fully manufactured.3. Provision will be made enabling the Minister, after consultation with theindustry concerned and with the associations of local authorities, to alter the basic totals of rateable values of the Gas Boards or Electricity Boards on theoccasion of further revaluations or other substantial changes of circumstances,the alteration to be made by Order.4. The provisions of the Local Government Act, 1948, will be amended tosecure that partial use of railway and canal properties for other purposes is notseparately rated ; and no separate rating of their advertising rights.ANNEX CGeneral Grant based on Weighted PopulationDetails of the Formula1. The grants will be payable to all county and county borough councils.Each authority will receive a share of the total amount fixed in advance. Thiswill be made up of three elements determined in accordance with the formula,viz. : (a) a basic share ;(b) supplementary shares ;(c) a rate product deduction.2. The numerical factors in the formula, as well as the total amount of thegrant for each year, will be prescribed by Order for each grant period. Thefigures accompanying this Paper assume a total of general grants of approximately 2791 millions. The numerical factors in the formula stated below have been fixed so as to produce in total that amount of grant, and are subject to revisionin the light of changes in grant levels.3. (a) The basic share is as follows:  [ 4-52] per head of the total population of the area ; plus  0-40 foreach child under 15 years of age in the population of the area.
(b) The supplementary shares are as follows :  (i) School children. An amount per head of total population, of 0-06 multiplied by the amount by which the number of chil-dren on the registers of the local authority&apos;s maintained and assisted schools per 1,000 total population (to the nearest wholenumber), exceeds 120.(ii) Young children and old people.  0-32 for each child under 5,and each person over 65 in the population of the area.(iii) High density. A percentage of the basic share, the percentagebeing one half of the amount by which the number of personsper acre in the area exceeds 18.(iv) Low density. A percentage of the basic share, payable in area where the number of miles of road per 1,000 population exceeds2 ; the percentage being twice times the number of miles of road per 1,000 population, subject to a maximum percentage of60.(v) Declining population. A percentage of the basic share, the per-centage being half the amount by which the percentage declinein population over the past 20 years exceeds 5 per cent.(vi) High costs in Greater London. An amount equal to 5 percent of the basic share, payable to all areas wholly or partlywithin the Metropolitan Police Area.(c) The rate product deduction. The product of a rate of 12 pence forthe area is subtracted from the sum of the basic and supplementaryshares.4. The total amount of grant to be distributed is arrived at as follows :  m.Estimated total for 1956-57 of the specific grants to be absorbed into the general grant     ...      ...       .........      ...      298less Reduction to take account of the product of re-rating seeparagraph 31 of the Paper        ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        18+Amount of general grant    ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      279^5. The relation between the three elements in the total amount is asfollows :  m.Total of basic share   ...      ...      ...       .........      ...      206Total of supplementary shares      ...      ............      105Aggregate of basic and supplementary shares ...      ...      ...      311less total of rate product deduction        ...      ...      ...      ...        3HAmount of general grant    ...      ...............      2794ANNEX the Details of Proposals in respect of Equalisation Grants(Re-named Rate Deficiency Grants)1. Hitherto equalisation grants have been payable only to county and countyborough councils, but in each county (whether or not the county council iseligible for equalisation grant) capitation sums have been distributable by thecounty council to county district councils. (London has its own EqualisationScheme worked on the same principles as the grants from the Exchequer, so asto redistribute rate burdens.)   The equalisation grants payable to county councils
which qualify for them have been assessed not only on the expenditure of thecounty council but also on that of all local authorities within the administrativecounty. Under the new proposals capitation payments by county councils willbe abolished, and instead grants (renamed &quot; Rate Deficiency Grants&quot;) will be payable by the Exchequer direct to county district councils and metropolitan borough councils which qualify. The rate of deficiency grants payable to countycouncils will be assessed only on the counciTs own expenditure for general countypurposes.2. As the Committee of 1953 recommended, limits to .the amount of expendi-ture ranking for grant will be applied on the same lines as have operated in theLondon Equalisation Scheme since 1948. The effect will be that in considering a new project or an expansion of a service there can be no assurance that theincreased cost will attract rate deficiency grant ; and so far as this grant isconcerned each new project will have to be considered on the basis that thewhole cost might fall on the rates.3. In view of the weighting factors proposed in the general grant, it is not now necessary to proceed with the recommendations of 1953 for extra factors in these grants for diminishing populations or for rapidly increasing popula-tions. It is now practicable for the same reason to abolish the weighting factorfor children, so that the only weighting factor remaining in these grants will bethat for sparsity in counties. This weighting will be increased to two-fifths(instead of one-third) of the additional population required to bring the popula-tion per mile of road up to seventy, to take account of the fact that the grantis assessed only on the county&apos;s expenditure for general county purposes, and because of the other changes.4. The grants will be assessed on the basis of rate products instead of rate-able value, excluding costs of collection of rates from the expenditure rankingfor grant. The operation of section 8 of the Rating and Valuation (Miscellane-ous Provisions) Act, 1955, in respect of rate allowances for charities had alreadyshown the marked degree to which rateable value may in some areas be anunreliable index of the rate income of a local authority ; and this change will automatically take account of all losses and leakages of rates, and afford a truermeasure of rate resources.5. In view of the payment of grants direct to county districts and metro-politan boroughs the obligations upon county councils to make grants to county district councils and metropolitan borough councils in aid of the salaries of medical officers of health and public health inspectors, and towards planningexpenses, will be abolished ; and the various discretionary powers of countycouncils to make contributions will be merged into one enabling power withoutany need for Ministerial approval.6. The guarantee provisions in subsections (3) and (4) of section 3 of theLocal Government Act, 1948, will be abolished. The effect will be that in allcases grant assistance will be up to the average for the whole country but no more.7. Section 2 of the Public Service Vehicles (Travel Concessions) Act, 1955,which precludes expenditure under that Act from ranking for grant, will alsobe abolished. The promotion of legislation in this form entailing an artificialapportionment of expenditure not ranking for grant is administratively verytroublesome.8. It remains for consideration whether the London Equalisation scheme should be amended in the light of the changes being made in the rate deficiencygrants. In any event, the statutory basis of the scheme will be amended so asto allow an alteration on these lines if thought desirable after consultation withthe authorities concerned.
