Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1957SECRET Copy No. 5 4C. (57) 14721st June, 1957CABINETDEVELOPMENT AREASMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade on 14th May the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with the Home secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to submit revised proposals on the lines indicated in their discussion on the question of altering the existing Schedule ofDevelopment Areas (C.C. (57) 40th Conclusions, Minute 5). The Prime Minister,in summing up the discussion, suggested that, before reaching a decision, theCabinet should consider the practical implications of the course proposed in the shape of a programme which covered all stages of the action to be taken and whichexamined both the arrangements for the future of the Government-owned factories and the scope and nature of the legislation involved.Alterations in the existing Schedule of Development Areas2. I propose, subject to consultations with local authorities, to remove thefollowing areas from the Schedule:  East South Wales;Wrexham;Merseyside;South Lancashire;The southern and western parts of the North-East Development Area outsidethe coal field;The parts of the West Cumberland Development Area outside the principalcoal and iron-ore mining area;North Ayrshire;South Lanarkshire and Sanquhar.I propose also to add a new area North-West Wales.Disposal of Government-owned Factories in Development Areas3. Expert advice obtained by the Board of Trade from business men of widefinancial experience is that the property market (i.e., property investmentcompanies, institutional investors and sitting tenants) would be able to take up 20 millions of property within about two years and that selling the physical assetswithin such a period would probably be more beneficial to the Exchequer thanselling company shares on the lines of my original proposal in E.A. (57) 42. this advice was given in the knowledge that the properties include factories on individualsites and group sites as well as integrated industrial estates of which the largestby far in the areas concerned is Treforest, near Cardiff, the freehold of which isowned by the Estate Company, not the Board of Trade. Such estates could hardly be broken up for sale to sitting tenants; it seems reasonable however to expectinstitutional investors or property companies to be ready to buy the freeholds witha view to managing and developing the estates on a commercial basis. I have little doubt that if the Board of Trade itself were to undertake the sale of the properties,51787
Ministers would be subject to undesirable pressures on individual transactions whichwould seriously hamper the process of selling and result in the Government gettingless than they ought. I think it essential, therefore, that the responsibility for sellingthe properties should rest with a body separate from the Board of Trade and operating independently with statutory powers of its own.4.   I, therefore, now propose that(a) we set up a small body of business men with the statutory duty of sellingthe properties at the best possible prices. (I would not in any wayexclude sale to local authorities, though I am advised that in manycases this is likely to present difficulties owing to the inadequacy oftheir powers and of their administrative capacity);(b) and that responsibility for managing the properties, pending their sale,should remain with the present Estate Companies acting on behalf ofthe Board of Trade.Scope and nature of legislation. For this purpose a Bill would be needed to establish the disposalorganisation and to define its functions and also to empower the Board of Tradeto spend money on the properties during the interval between removal of the area from the Schedule and sale.Timetable6. The legislation referred to in paragraph 5 would need to have been enactedbefore the order removing any part of the existing Development Areas from theSchedule comes into effect.7. If, therefore, my colleagues accept the proposals in paragraphs 2, 4 and5,1 need(i) authority for Parliamentary Counsel to prepare the Bill referred to inparagraph 5;(ii) a place to be found for the Bill in the Parliamentary programme for next session and an understanding that it will be introduced as early aspossible in the session so as to permit of the orders proposing alterations in the Schedule to be laid with as little further delay after the statutoryconsultations have been completed.8.   If my colleagues agree to the above, I would proceed as follows:  (i) make an immediate announcement in Parliament on the lines of theattached statement. I would simply say, at this stage, as regards thefuture of the Government-owned factories in the areas proposed for removal from the Schedule that arrangements would be made to dealwith them;(ii) immediately after having announced in Parliament the Governmenfsview that there was a &quot; prima facie &quot; case for making the alterations inthe Schedule proposed, I would arrange for the consultations with each of the local authorities affected to be started;(iii) I would prepare a short White Paper in explanation of the proposals whichI should hope to have ready by the end of September provided that thestatutory consultations with local authorities have been completed by then;(iv) I would propose to lay this White Paper at the same time as the draft order proposing alterations in the Schedule;(v) the timing of this latter action would, as stated in paragraph 5, follow afterand be regulated by the progress reached with the legislation.9. I invite my colleagues to endorse the proposals in paragraphs 2, 3-4 and 5,the timetable and procedure outlined in paragraphs 6-8 and to approve the draft announcement annexed.D. E.Board of Trade, S.W.1,20th June, 1957.
DRAFT STATEMENT ON DEVELOPMENT AREA policy. Under the Distribution of Industry Act, 1945, the Board of Trade, actingjointly with the Secretary of State for Scotland where an area in Scotland isconcerned, may by order remove an area from the Schedule of Development Areaswhen they are satisfied that the distribution of industry in that area is such thatthere is no longer likely to be a special danger of unemployment. Similarly, areasmay be added when it appears to the Board of Trade that such a danger is likelyto arise.2. The Select Committee on Estimates (1955-56) have severely criticised, intheir reports, the retention of areas in the Schedule where there is no longer anyspecial danger of unemployment. In their reply the Board of Trade have statedthat they have kept a continual watch on the situation with the intention of making proposals to Parliament when they judge the time appropriate.3. The Government now believe that, in the light of current economic circumstances and their assessment of the future, retention on the Schedule of several areas at present included can no longer be justified. They consider, there-fore, that there is now a prima facie case for removing East South Wales,Wrexham, &quot;Merseyside, South Lancashire, the southern and western parts of theNorth-Eastern Development Area outside the coal field, the part of the WestCumberland Development Area outside the principal coal of iron-ore mining area,North Ayrshire and South Lanarkshire and Sanquhar from the Schedule.4.   The Government propose also to add North-West Wales to the Schedule.5. Consultation has taken place with the Minister of Welsh Affairs abouteach of the changes affecting Wales.6. Consultations will accordingly be initiated with the local authorities concerned, as required under the Act, with a view to the necessary order being submitted later to Parliament.7. Arrangements will be made to deal with the Government-owned factories in those areas which may be removed from the Schedule.
