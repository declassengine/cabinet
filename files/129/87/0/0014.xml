This gives a good indication of the line he will take on the crucial problem of employment, which will arise as a result of the cuts in the defence programme.D.S.Ministry of Defence, S. W.l.3rd May,   1957.
RECORD OP MEETING HELD AT 12 O1CLOCKON FRIDAY, APRIL 26TH AT THEOPPICE OP THE PRIME MINISTER OP MALTA, VALETTAPresent:   Mr. Duncan Sandys, Minister of DefenceMarshal of the Roj^al Air PorceSir William DicksonMr. Trafford Smith, Lieutenant-Governor of MaltaMr. Mintoff, Prime Minister of MaltaMr. Ellul Mercer, Deputy Prime Minister and minister of WorksMr. Tabone, Minister of Emigration and labour mr. Bruce, Economic Adviser to the maltese GovernmentMr. Paris, Economic Secretary1.     After welcoming the Minister of Defence Mr. Mintoffreferred to the Memoranda lie had submitted to the Ministerand said that the Maltese Government were concerned as tothe effects of changes in Commonwealth defence policy on Malta, mainly in the economic sphere.    They were anxiousto know the prospects for the future.2.     Mr. Sandys thanked Mr. Mintoff for putting hisGovernment&apos;s views on record in the Memoranda, and explainedthat Her Majesty&apos;s Government had decided to go over toall-regular forces, and thereby to reduce the total strengthof the three Services to about half,  over five to six years.There would be big reductions in the first three to fouryears,  especially in garrisons, which would be reduced tothe absolute minimum, reliance being placed in future onrapid reinforcement by air.    Thefte reductions would takeplace everywhere,  including Malta, but details had net yetbeen worked out.    The military plan for Malta would bedecided in the light of the views expressed to him during his present visit.
3.     Major changes would not come about overnight.    Butit was clear that the large reductions in the manpower ofthe Navy, Army and Air Force would inevitably curtail thevolume of civilian employment in naval dockyards and other .ancillary establishments, both at home and in Malta.k.     Malta could not, any more than the United Kingdom, beinsulated against the effects of these cuts.    Aircraft,munitions and ordnance factories would all have to be severely cut.   Her Majesty1s Government would consult fully with the Maltese Government and. would try and help to ease the transition by giving maximum warning and encouragingcommercial and other work being taken on where possible.5.     Mr. Sandys said he was examining the possibility of using any spare capacity in the Dockyard for commercialwork.    He did not, however, thereby intend to convey thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government would accept any responsibility for providing other work payable from public funds to make upfor the cuts in defence work.    Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould co-operate and be helpful in every possible way, but were definitely not prepared to replace defence orders byother Government expenditure.6.     Mr. Mintoff then went on to suggest that a rediictionof employment in Service establishments might give anopportunity to reduce such establishments as the Dockyard,E.E.M.E. and the R.A.E. maintenance base at Safi, byturning over some of the capacity to the Maltese Government,who would use it either directly or by lease for commercial purposes.
7.     Mr. Sandys said that if there were a majorreorganisation, some capacity might he made available for commercial use.   Partial use - e.g. at certain seasons -would be more likely, in which case the Admiralty would notpart with control over the establishments, but would under-take civil work where there was spare capacity.   Mr. Mintoffand Mr. Ellul Mercer both pressed the idea of turning oversurplus capacity to the Maltese Government.8.     Mr. Mintoff then referred to the Declaration ofJuly, 1955, by the two Maltese political Parties and her majesty&apos;s Government, in which the &quot;avoidance of unemployment&quot;was set out as an agreed &quot;objective&quot; of policy of the maltese and British Governments,    When the Minister ofDefence pointed out that t. is was not a &quot;guarantee tomaintain&quot; the existing level of employment, Mr. Mintoffreferred to the passage about the &quot;sustained effort by both Governments&quot;.    The Declaration was not to be regardedsimply as a pious hope.    He also referred to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s Integration offer on the subject of employment.Mr. Sandys said that the problem was in some way similar tothat in Northern Ireland, where cuts had had to be madedespite the lack of alternative employment.   Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment had done all they could to encourage industryto place more work there, but had not been wholly successful.Mr. Mintoff countered that the economic relations between her Majesty&apos;s Government and Northern Ireland were different from those between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and Malta.Mr. Sandys emphasized that Her Majesty&apos;s Government wouldcertainly make a &quot;sustained effort&quot; to encourage commercial
activity in Malta as they had done in Northern Ireland,&quot;but they could not guarantee to maintain the present levelof employment.9.     Mr. Ellul Meroer said that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwore under a moral responsibility to maintain employment in malta, in which, the Welfare State having not yet &quot;beenestablished, unemployment really meant grave privation.Hence the necessity to discuss discharges from Serviceestablishments with Her Majesty&apos;s Government.    In the spiritof integration, there sho-ald be full co-operation between-Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Maltese Government in providing alternative emplo^Tiient.10.   Mr. Mintoff likewise insisted that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Maltese Government must accept joint responsibility for providing alternative employment.Mr. Sandys described any such principle as fantastic.Mr. Mintoff pressed him to undertake to apply the samemeasures as in England to avoid unemployment.   Mr. Sandyssaid that, as in Britain, Her Majesty1s Government would do everything practicable to encourage an increase in civilianwork in the dockyards.    This, however, could not be broughtabout overnight.    It was a long-term job.11.   Mr. Mintoff said that the responsibilities of each sidemust be defined.   Mr. Sandys agreed that any misunderstandingabout the meaning of the 1955 Declaration should be removed.12.   Mr. Ellul Mercer pointed out that whereas the British .economy was not based on defence, in Malta reductions in defence expenditure attacked the very foundations of the island&apos;s whole economy.   Mr. Tabone added that discharges- k -
threw all the Government1s plans, based on the latest budgetdiscussions with Her Majesty&apos;s Government,  out of gear.Mr. Mintoff maintained that the current budget had been framed in consultation between the Economic Commission andthe Services&apos;,  on the basis that the Services were pledgednot to reduce local employment.   Mr. Trafford Smith pointedout that while the Services no doubt said in their evidence to the Economic Commission that they would try and minimiseunemployment, and might well have referred to plans to take on more labour for the underground oil scheme, they could hardly have given a general pledge to maintain employment ata fixed level.13.   Mr. Sandys said that the Dockyard, like a private firm,could not keep on labour for which there was insufficientwork.   Mr. Mintoff returned to his point about the exclusivedependence of the Maltese economy on Service employment.    Ifthere had been a mixed economy, the position wotild. have beendifferent, but if Her Majesty&apos;s Government wish to retain thegood will of the people of Malta, which would be necessaryfor the running of an efficient base, they must maintainemployment.14&quot;.   Mr. Sandys referred to the deep sentiment of good willfor Malta in the United Kingdom and made it clear that thiswas the primary reason why Her Majesty&apos;s Government had welcomed the integration initiative.    Britain&apos;s response tothis proposal was inspired from the heart and not from hopes of material advantage.    He warned Mr. Mintoff not to overplaythe defence card.    It was easy to exaggerate Malta,&apos;s military importance.   While Malta was still a very convenient naval base, especially in peacetime, it was strategically very much
less important in the -present world situation than in thelast war which was largely centred on the Mediterranean,Mr. Sandys said that in the event of global war, in which the threat was primarily from Russia, Malta was of littlestrategic importance.   Malta1s position was not favourableas a base for the launching of ballistic rockets or bomber aircraft, which could be better operated from elsewhere.One co-Id not foresee any large scale naval threat in theMediterranean apart from submarine activity.    Unlike Cyprus,Malta did not play any major part in our global war plans.16..   Mr. Sandys added that while Malta offered facilities as an aircraft staging post, with the increasing range of modern aircraft this was becoming less important.    Forexample the Comet in v/hich he was travelling, had flown from london to Cyprus direct in hi hours.   Nevertheless, the naval base in Malta, was undoubtedly of great convenienceparticularly in peacetime.    It was cheaper to repair ships of the Mediterranean Fleet in Malta than to send them backto England, provided of course that local&apos; costs did not risetoo much.    If wages and other costs were allowed to go onrising, it might become more economical to repair and refitthem in Britain.17.   Mr. Sandys went on to refer to paragraph 9(iii) ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s Integration offer, viz;&quot;For the first five years, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have agreed;-(iii;    Lastly and most important, to review theposition in the event of any drastic changein Imperial defence policy affectingemployment in Malta and to assist the maltese Government in taking remedial
measures to be agreed.    This obligationagain is unique and is not paralleled inin any part of the United Kingdom.    Suchan important undertaking could only begiven in the light of Malta&apos;s specialfortress position and as an earnest ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s attachment tothe Objectives of Policy consequent onthe new constitutional proposals.&quot;19.   Mr. Sandys said that Her Majesty&apos;s Government could not undertake additional obligations beyond this    and in anycase this offer was dependent upon integration taking place.The Maltese Government could not claim more favourable treatment in the matter of employment without Integrationthan Her Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to give withIntegration.20.   Mr. Mintoff said that there was no logic in Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s approach, and that he did not wish to discusswhat the Maltese government&apos;s moves would be if Integrationfell through.   Mr. Sandys asked whether it was a fact thatthe Maltese Government had rejected Her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;sintegration proposals.21.   Mr. Mintoff seemed reluctant to reply but, when pressed,he hesitantly agreed that this was the position.    Mr. Sandyssaid that,  quite frankly, many people in England thoughtthat Her Majesty&apos;s Government had been over generous, andthey would heave a sigh of relief if we were released fromthis offer, through Malta&apos;s rejection.   Mr. Mintoff  remarked that in Malta the Nationalists and the Church consideredthat in gO-.ng ahead with Integration he was selling Maltadown the river.   Mr. Sandys asked what in fact Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be getting ovit of Integration which they hadnot already got.   Mr. Ellul Mercer agreed that the Britishwould only continue to get what they were getting now.
2\\.    Mr. Sandys reiterated that he could not advise HerMajesty1s Government that the importance of Malta as a defence base was such as to justify their going further than the present proposals.    Judged by any standards otherthan sentiment, Her Majesty&apos;s Government1s offer was already over-generous.    On the other hand, the BritishGovernment would be sad to see Malta1s fine initiativefor Integration come to nothing.23.     Mr. Mintoff said that he was very sorry that her majesty&apos;s Government found it impossible to go the wholehog.    The Maltese Government would have supported them upto the hilt against the Church, the Nationalists and anyother opponents.    He had just heard that the ItalianGovernment had given a 12-year guarantee to Sicily which(was in much the same relationship to metropolitan italy as Northern Ireland was to the United Kingdom.    If Italycould do this for a population of several millions,  shouldBritain be frightened to unite with a small people of only320,000?   The principle must be accepted, however, thatthe Maltese people would be treated the same as theBritish.2k* Mr. Sandys said he felt sure that the Maltese, whowere a prous people, would not wish to become pensionersof Britain.- Mr. Mintoff said he had no desire for that?but the Maltese Government could not carry the people.
with, it, if moral values were not satisfied.     Mr. EllulMercer said that Mr. Mintoff had always had to fall onhis knees before U.K. Treasury officials to prove thatsome  5,000 project in Malta was justified.      In the face of this attitude, the Maltese Government were right inrequiring guarantees ef Her Majesty Governmentrswillingness to help in future.     The Minister&apos;s attitudeseemed to imply a repudiation of Her Majesty Government&apos;obligations in the matter ef employment.     Mr. Sandys saidthat what he contested was the suggestion that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment had some hard and fast obligation indefinitelyto guarantee to maintain the present level of employment.He emphasized the need to get away from the concept of a&quot;guarantee&quot;.     He did not accept the responsibility for providing alternative work for those discharged as a resultof defence cuts.     But he did accept a moral responsibility to co-operate with the Maltese authorities in helping themen affected to find other work, as the Government would do in similar circumstances in Britain.     The longestpossible notice would be given nf intended discharges, and her Majesty&apos;s Government would not allow Dockyard capacity to stand idle where this was avoidable.     Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment were prepared and anxious to help in this wayto ensure that any reductions were carried through with theleast hurt to the Maltese workers.     He has asked the admiral Superintendents to study the whole
problem and to keep in touch with the Maltese Governmentand the Trade Unions.     Mr. Sandys advised Mr. Mintoff to rely on the sense of fairness and moral responsibility ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government.     He would get more out of themthat way&quot;than by legalistic arguments.26.    The meeting then turned to the effect of possibledefence cuts on the Maltese regiments.     Mr. Sandysasked whether men who were suitable and willing wouldlike to join the British Army in the full sense.     would the Maltese Government wish this to be encouraged?Mr. Mintoff said he thought that the response would be favourable but only if they did not lose the benefits oftheir previous service.27.   Mr. Mintoff thanked the Minister for his franknessand asked if there would be any objection to hispublishing the Maltese Government&apos;s Memorandum.Mr. Sandys said that he would like to consult theGovernor.     Mr. Mintoff asked whether detailed writtenanswers could be given to the points in the Memorandum,possibly by officials after it had been closely studied.Mr. Sandys said he thought it better not to embark uponfurther correspondence.Despite the frank exchange of views the meetingended in a most friendly and affable atmosphere&apos;.     Inconclusion Mr. Mintoff pressed the Minister to urge hiscolleagues not to allow the proposal for integration to fail.
AGREED STATEMENT ON THE SOCIAL AND economic development OP MALTA ISSUED AFTER THEDISCUSSIONS WITH MALTESE PARTY leaders in JUNE-JULY 1955-All parties to the Conference are agreed that thesocial and economic development of Malta is a necessityand calls for a joint and sustained effort by both countries.    To assure the steady advance of the Islandsa long-term development plan is being prepared.Meanwhile, as part of the effort to improve the living standards of the Maltese people, the Conferenceendorses the following objectives(i)    raising the standard of education and other social services;(ii)    increasing substantially opportunities for employment outside Service establishments;and(iii)    avoiding unemployment.It is recognised by the United Kingdom Government and bythe Maltese Delegations that improved living standardscan be maintained only by increasing productivity and expanding the national income of Malta.    With this inview, Her Majesty&apos;s Government on their part undertaketo contribute to the cost of the necessary capital works,to help secure the technical means and, in the interim period before these measures lead to the requiredexpansion in Malta&apos;s own revenues, to assist as may prove necessary in balancing the budget on recurrentaccount.    The Maltese Delegations on their part recog-nise that the long-term development plan needs detailedelaboration and examination and each delegation pledgesits close co-operation with Her Majesty&apos;s Government inthis common task.    They also recognise that the degreeof success attained will depend on the hard work and self-discipline of the Maltese people and on the maltese government and people making the best possible contri-bution from their own resources.
