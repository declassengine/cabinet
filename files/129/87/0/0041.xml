H.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th June, 1957.
THE OVERSEA INFORMATION services .-introduction. The starting point of our review of the Oversea Information Services wasthe Drogheda Report published in 1953. We have drawn fully upon the argumentsand conclusions of this Report, which has perhaps received less attention than itspenetrating and comprehensive character warranted. If we do not acknowledgein every case our indebtedness to the Drogheda Committee, the reason lies in our desire for brevity rather than in any lack of gratitude.2. In the main, the Drogheda analysis still holds good. If the recommenda-tions of the Drogheda Committee had been fully and speedily implemented, therewould be less complaint about our information services to-day. But in some respectsthose recommendations are now out of date. In any event, the political andeconomic developments since it was written call for a fresh review of the principles on which our information services should be based and the machinery by which our policies and objectives can most effectively be made known to the world.3. Although there are differing views about the value of information services,what is beyond dispute is that information services are not, and can never be, a substitute for policy and for strength. If the substance of authority and powerare lacking, no amount of information or propaganda will conceal or repair this deficiency. What does not follow, however, is that, if a country undergoes arelative decline in military and economic strength, its information services shouldbe scaled down proportionately. The converse is nearer the truth. Military andeconomic strength are not the whole story. Ideas are weapons in their own right.In our own day they have perhaps acquired a greater political importance than atany time since the religious wars of three hundred years ago. In the modernconflict of ideologies they offer, to those who command them and use them withskill an instrument of great and subtle power.4. For example, we are witnessing to-day the expansion of technology on a scale, and at a speed, inconceivable only a few years ago. More countries aremoving towards independence, while lacking the political maturity and experience to withstand the insidious corruption of Communism. In both respects we can offer a distinctive contribution to the shaping of world society in the years ahead.We have great scientific knowledge and political experience. We know whatmakes democratic institutions &quot; tick.&quot; We have high standards of justice, tolerationand truth. In short, we have much to offer and every good reason to offer it. Butwe can exercise our full influence only if we are prepared to devote enough effort and resources to ensuring that the peoples of other countries have every opportunityto understand our ideas, our policies and our objectives. As the Drogheda Reportsays &quot; The Information Services must to-day be regarded as part of the normalapparatus of diplomacy of a Great Power.&quot;5. Our information services must contribute to the realisation of definiteobjectives, which are political, economic, and strategic:  (a) Politically, they must reinforce the cause of the free world in the cold war. To this end they should seek to strengthen the morale of our friends, to influence the countries which are still uncommitted orapathetic, and, where possible, to undermine our enemies behind theIron Curtain.(b) They should reflect our interests and prestige as the centre of a uniqueCommonwealth of free nations. As the years pass, the old commonwealth countries tend to become more independent in out lookand a correspondingly greater effort is needed to preserve the links between them and the United Kingdom. The addition of new members,India, Pakistan, Ceylon and Ghana with Malaya and Singapore shortly to follow has brought its own problems. Old prejudices and phobiashave to be overcome. On the other hand, many ties of language, cultureand economic interest will continue to bind these countries to us as longas we help them to understand the policies of democratic governmentand economic progress for which we stand. In the Colonies, as controlfrom London loosens, it becomes increasingly important to strengthen the bonds of sentiment and enlightened self-interest between the UnitedKingdom and these emerging nations. The Cold War has to be fought51756B
in the Colonies, as elsewhere, with active anti-Communist propagandaas well as with education in the working of democratic institutions.And much still needs to be done to convince world opinion that britain&apos;s colonial record is one of enlightened and steady progress something to be commended, not condemned.(c) Economically, while the search for markets and the promotion of sales is mainly the responsibility of private industry, the information services can be of value in inspiring confidence in our economic prospects andtrade policies, in fostering goodwill towards British products, in informing the world of our technological and scientific progress, and inextending the teaching of the English language, one of the most valuableof our invisible exports.(d) Strategically, the experience of the last few years has re-emphasised theview expressed by the Chiefs of Staff to the Drogheda Committee thatthe oversea information services are &quot; a weapon no less essential thanthose employed by the fighting forces.&quot; Our defence policy rests on anetwork of alliances above all NATO, the Bagdad Pact andSEATO which themselves depend, for their harmonious functioningon an awareness by our partners of the part which we can play. Andwherever one of our strategic interests is endangered in Cyprus, in aden, in the Horn of Africa world opinion should be guided to an appreciation of our long-term objectives. In all these respects, theinformation services can reinforce defence policy. As the Armed forces are reduced in size, the need to use the techniques of information tosecure goodwill to the British connection and political stability in ares which are strategically important to us will become greater rather thanless.II-PRINCIPLES AND PRIORITIES6. Dissipated and unco-ordinated effort is a waste of public funds. the deployment of information activity should conform to certain general principles and follow a prescribed order of geographical priorities. These criteria, necessarilyimprecise, will not enable us to measure our success in other than rough and readyterms. But they are of some value as a yardstick for testing individual proposals and for ensuring that a limited amount of butter is spread on the bread to the best advantage.7.   The general principles which we propose are as follows:  (a) Information services should have definite objectives, related to the political,strategic and economic policies of Her Majesty&apos;s Government. the objectives should find expression both in general terms and in termsspecifically related to the particular requirements of individual areas.We agree with the view of the Drogheda Committee that &quot; overseaspropaganda which meets a demand without producing some ultimatepolitical or commercial benefit for this country represents so muchpublic money wasted.&quot;(b) The primary emphasis of our information policy should be placed onretaining our friends and winning over uncommitted countries.(c) Stability and continuity of effort are essential.  If our information services are to effect the maximum impact, they must be planned ahead for aperiod of time and allowed to operate without the uncertainty offrequent modifications.id) It remains important, as hitherto, to attract and retain the sympathy ofthe influential few in each country. But it is no less important in certain cases to adopt additional means of enlisting the interest of the massaudience, either to influence it directly or to divert its attention fromthe activities of unfriendly countries.(e) The information methods and media employed in the case of a particular country or area should be so chosen as to achieve, in the light of the characteristics of that area, the most favourable reception.(f) The deployment of the information services must be sufficiently flexible toenable the effort to be switched from one area to another as the needmay dictate.(g) It follows that, in terms of organisation, we should seek both to maintainpermanent points of contact in selected countries as the basis of a continuing information service, and to be able to reinforce our effort in particular areas from time to time.
III.-ORGANISATION OF THE OVERSEA INFORMATION services.   Effective information services imply two things:  (a) There must be an organisation &quot; in the field,&quot; correctly deployed andadequately covering the areas of the world with which we are principally concerned. This &quot; field &quot; organisation must be supported by efficientcentral services at home. The elements of the &quot; field &quot; organisationare the information staffs maintained abroad by the OverseaDepartments and the British Council, together with broadcasting and television services. The central services are those supplied by the headquarters of the Oversea Departments, the British Council and theB.B.C., and by the Central Office of Information and the stationery office.(b) There must be a focus of co-ordination at home, to supply policy guidancefor operations abroad, to eliminate duplication and extravagance, andto ensure that our resources are deployed sufficiently flexibly to enablethe emphasis to be switched, from one theatre to another according to changes in political and economic requirements.9. Our report is divided into two main sections, corresponding to this sub-division of our subject matter. In Part III we examine the organisation &quot; inthe field,&quot; under the three headings of Departmental information staffs and theBritish Council; the British Broadcasting Corporation; and television services.In Part IV we make some suggestions about the focus of co-ordination.(1) Departmental information staffs and the British Council10. The work of the information staffs of the Oversea Departments has been adequately described in the Drogheda Report, and that description need not be repeated here. Nothing that has happened since the Drogheda Report was completed has diminished the importance of these staffs and the value of theWork which they do. On the contrary, recent events have brought home to us the need, in all the main centres of opinion in countries overseas, for informationstaffs whose job it is to ensure that the policies of Her Majesty&apos;s Government are understood by public opinion in the countries to which they are accredited andto work for the maximum of local support and goodwill. There is no note ofdissent in the recommendation by Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors and our high commissioners overseas that the information services at their disposal should befurther enlarged.11. We have considered the proposals for expansion put forward by departments and the British Council. In the Appendix to our Report we havegraded these proposals-in terms both of the oversea staff involved and of the related expansion of central services in three categories of priority. these categories reflect the general principles which we have outlined in paragraph 7.We are satisfied that those projects which appear under the heading Priority Iare necessary and urgent if our information services are to play an efficient partin the defence of our interests in critical areas of world opinion. If additional resources can be made available, the projects listed under Priority II are desirable,while the projects in Priority III have had a case made out for them.12. So graded, the Departmental proposals speak for themselves. We neednot comment further upon them beyond saying that they admittedly involve a significant expansion of the present scale of expenditure. In the case of Priority Iprojects, the cost of the additional measures which we propose would be, in thecase of the Oversea Departments and the Central Office of Information, about 500,000 in the first year rising to about  880,000 in a full year. These are substantial figures. Nevertheless, we have no reason to believe that anything lesswould suffice to meet the need. We have not been able to examine in detail theexisting establishment of oversea posts and the present scale of the supporting services at home. But the Drogheda Committee observed four years ago thatthe scale of the oversea information services was inadequate to fulfil therequirements which the Committee then defined; and this inadequacy has certainly not been made good in the period since the Drogheda Report was presented.We have therefore come to the conclusion that there is no alternative to a net51756
increase in the scale of the services deployed &quot; in the field.&quot; This is not to say,of course, that changing circumstances may not reveal the need to modify, fromtime to time, the geographical balance of the existing services. For example,expenditure by the Foreign Office on information services in Western germany has been progressively reduced in recent years; but it still stands at a figure in the region of  450,000 a year. We consider that the possibility of progressively reducingthis sum by a substantial amount should be examined.13. But, although the proposals listed in the Appendix will in most casesspeak for themselves, there are certain individual groups of projects which call for some additional comment:  (a) The Central Office of Information14. It is to the C.O.I. that the Oversea Departments look for the supplyof material for information posts overseas. All Departments have warm praisefor the quality of C.O.I.&apos;s product and for the efficiency with which the organisation is run. The additional C.O.I. measures listed under Priority I in the Appendixrepresent only those which, after discussion with the Director-General, we regard as necessary and urgent at the present time. They consist mainly of improvements in the magazines, newsreels, &amp;c, which the C.O.I. supply for the Middle East and,where possible, for the Iron Curtain countries; a very desirable increase in theprovision for visitors to and from Commonwealth countries; an expansion ofthe general services which the organisation supplies to oversea posts (an expansionwhich has been calculated in relation to the increased establishment which wesuggest); and provision for the development of the C.O.I. film and television service, on which we comment in greater detail in the section on television below.15. We have relegated to Priority III with some regret an interestingproposal by the Foreign Office for the institution of a new magazine for South-east asia, which would be published in several languages but would have a commoncontent. The expenditure involved, however, would be substantial (some  60,000 ayear), and we have felt obliged to give higher priority to the proposed new Arabicmagazine aimed at educated readers in the Middle East. We have also rejected again with considerable regret a suggestion that we should try to launch a new scheme for promoting the export of books. This technique is employed on aconsiderable scale by the United States, under a programme the InformationalMedia Guarantee Programme whereby the local currency proceeds of exportswhich are not convertible into dollars are used to meet the local expenditure of theUnited States Government. It seems doubtful, however, whether it would bepossible, in the case of most of the countries in which we are interested, to arrangefor the local currency proceeds of book exports to be used to finance local expenditure by Her Majesty&apos;s Government. The chances of the scheme&apos;s becomingself-supporting are, therefore, small; and if the project could only succeed with the help of a subsidy, there are other informational projects which have a higher claimto Exchequer assistance of this kind. We recommend, however, that the Board ofTrade should keep this matter under review, and should neglect no opportunity tosecure an expanded export of books from this country as soon as the balance ofpayments of the countries concerned makes this possible.(b) The British Council16. The proposals for the expansion of the services of the British Councilrequire particularly careful examination, in view of the public attention which is constantly and often critically directed at this body. For long-term work suchas that which the Council carries out, stability is more important than expansion.The activities of the Council ought not to be extended or additional staff recruitedand trained unless the Council can be assured that it will be enabled to maintainthe enlarged services and to rely on continuity of policy.17. The case for authorising the British Council to extend the scope of its operations is strong. We have been greatly impressed by the high quality of thematerial which it produces and the valuable work which it does in fostering contacts between individuals, particularly in the professional classes and with those, such asstudents, who are likely to become leaders of opinion in their own countries. the criticism that the Council is concerned only to encourage the more high-brow ofthe arts is as unfounded as it is unfair. In fact, activities connected with drama,music and the fine arts account for only about 2 per cent, of the CounciFs totalexpenditure. The great bulk of the CounciFs effort is concerned with education, the
sciences and professions, and English language and literature. Moreover, althoughthe Drogheda Committee recommended a progressive increase of some  630,000 ayear in the Government grants to the Council (to be reached at the end of a periodof five years), and although the Councils grants have in fact risen by about  760,000in the three years to 1956-57, only about  130,000 of this increase reflects theexecution of the Committee&apos;s recommendations, the balance being due to increases in costs, capital expenditure on buildings, extra work not covered by the drogheda committee&apos;s recommendations but undertaken at Government request, and an expansion in the Middle East over and above that provided for in the DroghedaReport. There is clear room for a further expansion of the CounciPs activities;and the measures to which we have accorded Priority I represent, in our view, what should be sanctioned now.18. These proposals are estimated to cost about  460,000 in a full year and about  210,000 in the first year. After discussion with the Director-General, webelieve that an extension of the Councils activities on this scale would bothcontribute to the purposes of our information services as a whole and would providethe Council itself particularly in respect of the new pension scheme which is included in these proposals with a greater assurance of stability and continuity.Of the full year cost about  160,000 represents the cost of additional posts overseas,and about  300,000 reflects expenditure in this country on the enlargement of the council&apos;s headquarters, and the development of various schemes for the provisionof books, the fostering of visits to the United Kingdom by students and membersof the professional classes, and the expansion of the Council&apos;s Arts programme.The amount provided for the Arts programme may attract some criticism. Butit will increase the proportion of the CounciFs budget allocated to the arts from a mere 1 - 6 per cent, to no more than 2 - 4 per cent. If, as we hope, it is devotedmainly to the promotion of drama, it should not only provide an opportunity for strengthening the cultural links between the United Kingdom and other countriesbut also increase interest in English as a spoken language.19. We would emphasise that, in selecting the projects of the departments and the British Council which appear in Priority I, we have had in mind therecommendation of the Drogheda Committee that &quot; the highest priority should begiven to the work of the British Council in the under-developed countries of asia and in the British Colonies, and that, as a general rule, it should have a low priority in countries which share with us a European heritage.&quot; None of the additionalposts which we recommend as Priority I is in Europe, with the exception of the marginal cases of Yugoslavia and Turkey, (where rather special considerations apply), and the two Iron Curtain countries, Poland and Czechoslovakia, (as andwhen circumstances permit). For the rest the augmented effort will be directedalmost entirely to the Middle and Far East, Ceylon, India and various points in africa.(c) The Teaching of English20. In November 1955 the Cabinet invited the then Minister of education to arrange for a committee of officials to examine the problem of the teaching of english overseas (CM. (55) 41st Conclusions, Minute 7). We have considered theReport of this Committee, whose conclusions are endorsed by the present Ministerof Education. We agree with the official committee that &quot; English is a commodityin great demand all over the world: it is wanted not only for reasons of friendship and trade with the English-speaking countries, but also for other reasons notnecessarily connected with any desire to imitate British ways or to understandBritish history and culture. We are, therefore, looking at the. language mainly asa valuable and coveted export, which many nations are prepared to pay for, if itcan be supplied in the right quantities, and which some others would be glad to have on subsidised terms if they cannot pay the full price. English is, moreover, an export which is very likely to attract other exports British advisers and technicians,British technological or university education, British plant and equipment, andBritish capital investment. There are clear commercial advantages to be gained from increasing the number of potential customers who can read technical andtrade publicity material written in English.&quot;21. By contrast, the effort devoted to meet even the existing demand isregrettably slight, particularly in terms of the supply of United Kingdom teachersof English for posts overseas. French subsidised teachers overseas (not countingthe religious missions) are about ten times as numerous as our own. The Committee
comment rightly, in our opinion that &quot; the haphazard expansion of the teaching of English overseas is in marked contrast with the careful and sustained efforts ofthe French authorities to further the teaching of their language overseas. Formany years past the French Government have regarded French cultural work, bothin foreign countries and in French dependencies, as an important part of their foreign policy. This cultural work is essentially based on the teaching of French.To this effort, which still continues, France has owed, and owes, much of herprestige.&quot; It cannot be right that we should, in such a matter, fall so far behinda country whose oversea interests and commitments are considerably less than ourown.22. Certain steps should be taken, on the lines recommended by the official committee. Priority should be given to stimulating recruitment of United Kingdomteachers of English by the two main agencies concerned, the British Council andthe Colonial Office. The main factors which deter United Kingdom teachers from taking posts abroad are lack of assurance about an adequate salary and security of contract, and uncertainty of re-employment on return. Colonial Governmentsrecognise that, if posts are to be filled from the United Kingdom, salaries mustbe related to those in the United Kingdom and to the local cost and standard ofliving. Outside the Colonies, however, the difficulty can be met only by assistancefrom public funds. The objections to the payment of subsidies are obvious. Butthere are many parts of the world to which it will not be possible to attract moreteachers without Government aid. To secure that a reasonable proportion of available overseas posts was filled, the additional annual cost would be of the orderof  300,000.23. Security of contract and terms of service leave much to be desired. Thebest solution would be that the teacher going overseas (except to appointments in colonial territories, where Colonial Governments offer, for scheduled posts, thesecurity of membership of Her Majesty&apos;s Oversea Civil Service) should have a contract with the British Council, which would accept responsibility for filling thepost on behalf of the overseas authority. The annual administrative cost of runningthis scheme would be about  30,000 in a full year.24. The uncertainty of re-employment on return home is also a deterrent.United Kingdom teachers are not Civil Servants, and there is no simple or certainway of guaranteeing them suitable employment on their return from abroad. Butthe deterrent would be lessened if the Education Ministers were authorised to play a more positive part in both recruitment and reinstatement. The official committee proposed that, for this purpose, the Education Departments might sponsor theestablishment of a small central agency, to assist both the Colonial Office and theBritish Council in recruiting teachers for overseas service, including teachers of subjects other than the English language. The responsibility for identifying the posts, allocating priorities, selecting candidates and supervising their contracts ofemployment, would need to remain with the two recruiting bodies. But an agencylocated in the Ministry of Education could do valuable work in facilitating contacts between these two bodies and local education authorities, and in helping in thework of reinstatement. There would still be no means of compelling a localeducation authority to reinstate a teacher who had volunteered for service overseas.But the Ministry of Education^ sponsorship of the teachers&apos; cases should help to overcome any obstinacy or inertia on the part of local authorities. The additional expenditure involved by the establishment of such a central agency should bevery small, and we recommend its creation.25. Action is also needed in other directions to encourage the teaching of english abroad. The main steps recommended by the official committee are asfollows:  (a) The training, in an English-speaking country, of native teachers of Englishis as important as the supply of United Kingdom teachers. Scholarshipsshould be granted to enable key students from overseas to come to united Kingdom universities or other institutions for training inteaching English as a foreign language. It is suggested that her majesty&apos;s Government should, for this purpose, offer through theBritish Council and the Colonial Office one-year scholarships,numbering, say, fifty in the first year and rising to one hundred in thefourth year. An average total figure for a year&apos;s study might be put at  500, designed to cover tuition fees and maintenance.  The student
7 -    236or his Government should be expected to pay travel expenses. Onthis basis, the additional expenditure in a full year might be of theorder of  50,000.(b) Provision for the training of teachers of English as a foreign languageshould be made within the public teacher-training system as a whole.This should cover both serving teachers in the United Kingdom whoare prepared to volunteer for service abroad and oversea teachers whoare prepared to come to the United Kingdom for training. For theformer, short courses of one or two terms would suffice. For the latter,three-term courses of general teacher-training, with special referenceto the teaching of English, would be needed. At the maximum, theadditional expenditure involved might be, in a full year, about  20,000.Legislation would be required to enable the Education Ministers toassume responsibility for training teachers, whether United kingdom citizens or otherwise, for the express purpose of serving overseas. Localeducation authorities should be consulted about the proposals as awhole before the details are finally settled.(c) We  should   also   assist,  where  possible,   in  strengthening   existing arrangements for the training of oversea teachers of English in their own countries. This is particularly important in countries which may be reluctant, for reasons of national prestige, to accept many UnitedKingdom teachers in their own schools or to send many of their ownteachers abroad for training. In the Indian sub-continent there are atpresent five British Council Officers engaged full-time in giving practicaladvice on modern methods of English teaching to schools and teacher-training colleges and in organising and conducting refresher courses for teachers of English. There are signs, for example in India and pakistan, that the authorities are increasingly anxious to see Englishmore widely read and spoken. At least five additional officers withspecial qualifications for the teaching of English should be appointed tothe establishment of the British Council in the Asian commonwealth countries. In a full year the additional expenditure might be about 18,000. In addition, the Nuffield Foundation have agreed to finance a training project at the Central Pedagogical Institute at Allahabad, whichshould enable about eighty teachers a year to be trained locally. Withoutprejudice to voluntary initiative of this kind by the great philanthropictrusts and foundations (to which we should give all possibleencouragement) the British Council might well be enabled to sponsorand finance at least two more projects on the Allahabad model, one eachin India and Pakistan. In a full year, the additional expenditure mightbe of the order of  14,000.(d) The B.B.C.&apos;s programmes, known collectively as &quot; English by Radio,&quot;&quot; should be expanded. There is an enormous unsatisfied demand for this service. The fact that &quot; English by Radio &quot; is more successful and more widely heard than the corresponding United States or Frenchproductions is evidence of its value and of the importance of encouragingit. Relatively small additional expenditure would pay handsomedividends. An additional  10,000 a year would make possible both thepreparation of additional courses and an extension of currenttransmissions from London to countries outside Europe; and the fundsmade available to the B.B.C. by the grant-in-aid of the external services should be increased to this extent. Consideration should also be givento the possibility of expanding the service still further by reducing someof the B.B.C.&apos;s other and less important transmissions.26. The above list comprises the main recommendations of the official committee. In principle, we support them. The official committee suggested thatthey might involve expenditure of  150,000 a year in the first year, rising to about 430,000 in the fourth year. We are not convinced that, at least initially, the outlayneed be on this scale. We accept the view of the British Council that expenditureof this order implies a more rapid expansion than would be either practicable or desirable. In the first year, therefore, expenditure could be limited to about  75,000.It should rise gradually in later years to a higher figure, of the order envisaged bythe official committee for the fourth year of the scheme.27. But although we endorse without reservation the suggestion that we, inthis country, should introduce measures on this scale to foster the teaching of
English, we must not overlook the possibility of securing that the scope of the campaign might be enlarged and the burden on the United Kingdom tax-payermight possibly be reduced to some extent if we regarded the venture as a co-operativeone, in which other English-speaking countries might join with us. We suggestthat this possibility should be further explored, initially with selected members ofthe Commonwealth and subsequently with the United States.(2) The British Broadcasting Corporation28. The work of the Departmental information services and the british council is directed primarily to creating permanent contacts with the influentialleaders of opinion in oversea countries and to building up, over a period of years,a body of informed good-will towards the United Kingdom. Broadcasting and television, on the other hand, provide, more effectively than any other medium a tour disposal, a means of contact with the mass audience.29. We have considered the external services of the B.B.C. from three points of view first, the general relationship between the Corporation and Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment; second, the scale of the Corporation^ services; third, the adequacy of their capital equipment.(a) The Relationship between the B.B.C. and Her Majesty&apos;s Government30. The 1952 Licence and Agreement with the B.B.C. provides that &quot; TheCorporation shall consult and collaborate with the [oversea] Departments, andshall obtain and accept from them such information regarding conditions in, andthe policies of Her Majesty&apos;s Government towards, the countries so prescribedand other countries as will enable the Corporation to plan and prepare its programmes in its external services in the national interest.&quot;31. In practice, this arrangement has given rise to dissatisfaction. Althoughthe oversea Departments exercise their right to prescribe the countries to whichthe Corporation^ main effort should be directed and seek to influence the presentation of the programmes material, the Corporation have shown somereluctance to adjust their programmes according to the requirements of these departments. The Suez episode provided an example of what, to say the least,was felt to be an insufficient enthusiasm by the B.B.C. for the presentation of theGovernments case. As a result, an official was seconded from the Foreign Office toserve, in the Corporation^ own offices, as a liaison officer between the ForeignOffice and the B.B.C. and to advise the Corporation on the direction and. content of their programmes in the light of the requirements of foreign policy. Thisarrangement, however, did not work satisfactorily, and the liaison officer has nowbeen withdrawn from the B.B.C.32. Despite this experience, and others, we do not wish to recommend anyfundamental change in the relationship between the Government and the B.B.C.For one thing, we must recognise that we cannot hope to &quot; control&quot; the B.B.C.,however indirectly and unobtrusively, without encountering serious difficulties.Moreover, the Corporation^ external services cannot be arbitrarily divorced fromtheir domestic services, since the programmes draw upon a common source ofmaterial. If we tried to assume control of the external services in order to impartto them a particular emphasis or direction, the result could not fail to be, on occasion, discrepancies between the Corporation^ treatment of one and the sameitem of news in the home and oversea services discrepancies which would be boundto be detected, with results creditable neither to the Government nor to the B.B.C.For the Government to assume actual control of the programmes, in part or in whole, would mean that the Government would be answerable to Parliament forprogramme content.33. For such reasons we have formed the view, after considerable discussionboth with the B.B.C. and among ourselves, that we should uphold the doctrinelaid down in the 1946 White Paper on Broadcasting Policy (Cmd. 6852), namely,that &quot; as far as the content of the overseas services is concerned, the government consider that great care should be taken to ensure the complete objectivity ofthe news bulletins which will form the kernel of oversea broadcasting. TheCorporation^ reputation for telling the truth must be maintained, and thetreatment of an item in the overseas news bulletin must not differ in any materialrespect from its treatment in current news bulletins for domestic listeners. . . .&quot;.
554* Includes the North American service (40 hours) and &quot; London Calling Asia in English&quot;(5  hours).36. There is a case for some redeployment of the external services,particularly by curtailment of the European services. We ourselves originallyapproached the problem from this point of view, and sought, by effecting economies of about  \ million, mainly in Europe, to provide the bulk of the finance needed to expand the Middle East services and to strengthen to some extent the services to the Iron Curtain countries. An economy of such an order inevitably involvescompletely closing down the high-power short-wave transmitting station (O.S.E. 8)which is one of the main centres of transmission to Europe.V:; &apos;    51.756 .. -if! / -   .-. c ,: II1 * -11This doctrine was re-emphasised by the Drogheda Committee, who commentedthat &quot; we would deplore any attempt to use the B.B.C. for anything in the wayof direct propaganda of the more obvious kind. This is not to suggest that theB.B.C s External Services are not, in fact, a weapon of propaganda. The best and most effective propaganda to many countries consists of a factual presentation of the news and of British views concerning the news&quot;. We endorse thispronouncement; and we believe that the definition of the relationship between her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Corporation contained in the 1952 Licenceand Agreement goes as far as it is possible to go, consistently with the policywhich has been followed by successive Governments since the war, in establishing the right of the Government to influence as distinct fromcontrolling the Corporation^ presentation of their material. It also goes asfar as it is in the Governments interest to go. The impartial and objectivecharacter of the B.B.C&apos;s treatment of controversial subject matter is a nationalasset, which has been shown by experience to be of incalculable value abroad.It would, in our opinion, be foolish to diminish the value of this asset by any action which appeared to imply that the Corporation^ external services were being subjected to any greater degree of Governmental direction than has been thecase hitherto.34. This recommendation is, of course, based on the assumption that the enjoyment by the B.B.C. of independence in the field of programme content willbe matched by a corresponding sense of responsibility on their part to conduct their transmissions in the national interest. It also assumes that the overseaDepartments will vigorously maintain their rights under the 1952 Licence - and agreement. Since the withdrawal from the Corporation^ offices of the specialForeign Office liaison officer appointed at the beginning of the Suez episode, theForeign Office have appointed a First Secretary, in the appropriate section of theDepartment, with special responsibilities for study of B.B.C. questions and forliaison with the Corporation^ directing staff. This officer will have access toBush House, and accommodation there when necessary; and he will be entitledto see all output as required. The Foreign Office regard this appointment as satisfactory, and as likely also to reinforce, on occasion, the regular contacts withthe B.B.C. maintained by the Commonwealth Relations Office and the ColonialOffice. There has not yet been time to judge whether this arrangement will bemore effective than its predecessors in securing an effective implementation of the1952 Licence and Agreement.(b) The External Services of the B.B.C.35. This year&apos;s Budget provided nearly  5f millions for these services. (Ofthis sum, however, nearly  400,000 is attributable to the monitoring service, whichhad not previously been included.) The services can be broken down, in terms ofthe main areas served and on a rough-and-ready basis of the number of weeklyhours of broadcasting, as follows: :Areas Weekly HoursCommonwealth      ..................      ...... 64^*Colonies      ........................      ... 11Europe (including Iron Curtain countries)        ............ 158JRussia and satellites        ...............      ...... 781Middle East ............      ............... 38 South-East Asia and Far East    ......      ............ 26%Latin America       ........................ 29%General Overseas Service in English     ...      ...      ...      ...... 147
37. On closer examination, however, this proposal was found to be open to both technical and political objections. The technical argument runs thus. Thereare currently twenty-seven short-wave transmitter outlets available to the B.B.C.on United Kingdom sites. Two of these are obsolescent and of ineffectively lowpower. The closure of O.S.E. 8 would remove six of the most efficient and moderntransmitters, i.e., it would involve a reduction of effective transmitter potential by nearly 25 per cent.38. Another result would be a considerable reduction in the use of the medium-wave station at Norden and of the medium wave and VHF transmittersin Berlin for the B.B.C.&apos;s German Service. This reduction would endanger theCorporation^ continued use of these valuable facilities, which, owing to political pressure from the Federal Republic and from within Berlin, is already ratherdelicately poised. If we voluntarily reduced our use of them, the german authorities would almost certainly attempt to debar the B.B.C. from themaltogether. Since the whole of the German service is intended for the Soviet Zoneas well as for listeners in the Federal Republic, the Germans who live underCommunist domination would suffer equally with our friends in the Western halfof the country.39. Finally, and most important, the barrage transmissions across the iron curtain would be affected by the closure of O.S.E. 8. The barrage consists of the deployment of the maximum number of transmitters which can effectively be usedsimultaneously on the same programme, in order to counter the deliberate jammingof broadcast transmissions. The six transmitters of O.S.E. 8 play a major part inthe barrage measures to counter the deliberate jamming of our broadcasts in Russian,Hungarian, Czech, Roumanian and Polish, where they constitute more thanone-third of the total number of transmitters employed in the barrage at various points in the day. The political objections to a reduction in the effectiveness ofthese transmissions are very strong. But if, despite the closure of O.S.E. 8, barragetransmissions were to be preserved in:full vigour, capital expenditure of nearly 350,000 would be required to replace the transmitters concerned, and the revenue expenditure at other sites would also be increased as a result of the transfer of operations. In this way the bulk of the savings of  ^ million which was our originalobjective would be absorbed, with no net gain to the oversea broadcasting effort-as a whole and no expansion of services to other countries.40. It was technical reasons of this nature which first led us to reconsider the proposal to achieve major economies by the closure of the transmitter site whichis primarily directed to Europe. But the need to reconsider our policy wasreinforced by other considerations of a political character. In recent months, ithas become clear that we are approaching a new European policy. The Treatyof Rome was signed in March and may well be ratified by the turn of the year;and the problems of a;European Free Trade Area have, as a result, become more urgent. At the same time our defence economies have created some suspicion that we are attempting &quot; to tip-toe out of Europe.&quot; At such a time it seems unwisedeliberately to reduce the scale of our effort to. keep our friends in Europe informed about the true nature of our policies and objectives, and to forgo any- opportunityof influencing, however indirectly, the formation of public opinion ini the capitalsof Western Europe.41. -To say this is not to overrate the value of the B.B.C.&apos;s European services.It is not enough for good.services to leave.here. It is increasingly difficult for short-wave transmissions to survive competition with the stronger and clearersignals of local stations. There is no doubt that some part of the copious flow of material which the B.B.C. project into Europe is wasted, either because peopledo not listen to it or because the Corporation^ technical facilities are inadequate to secure i good and attractive reception in the countries concerned. We revert tothis latter point in connection with the expansion of the B.B.C.&apos;s capital facilities in paragraphs 47 to. 52 below. But as regards the extent to which Europeanaudiences listen to the B.B.C.&apos;s services, there is some evidence,to show that,despite the difficulties arid counter attractions, the Corporation^ Continentalaudience is not inconsiderable. For example, the ;B.B.C.,&apos;s latest survey of itsFrench audience revealed. 300,000 daily listeners and 1,200,000 who listened atleast once a week. The.daily audience for Moscow Radio (in-French) is only about one-third of: that forI the .B.B.C., French service. But; the Corporation^ Frenchservice (reduced in recent years) is noimore . than-, three hours per &apos;day, comparedwith 15\ hours as the sum of a day&apos;s broadcasting to France from countries in theSoviet orbit.   Similarly, the latest survey of the audience for the B.B.C.&apos;s
Norwegian service is said to show about 50,000 daily listeners and about 180,000who listened at least, once a week. These figures are higher than the audience forthe Soviet radio, although, when the B.B.C.&apos;s output in Norwegian was reduced toA\ hours a week under the economies of 1952, Moscow radio increased itsNorwegian output to 10^ hours a week. These figures, although perhaps not wholly immune from statistical criticism, do afford some indication of the extentof the B.B.C.&apos;s hold over its European audience and the relative paucity of itsoutput compared with the effort deployed in the same field by the Soviet and soviet-controlled broadcasting stations. They suggest that any wholesale andindiscriminate reduction in the B.B.C.&apos;s European services might, at this point oftime, be very unwise.Contraction of B.B.C. Services42. Nevertheless, there are some respects in which the external services ofthe B.B.C., including their European services, can be curtailed without excessivedamage. The Corporation themselves reluctantly admit this, although only on theunderstanding that the reductions are not justified except by a requirement of themost stringent economy and that they themselves must not be regarded as in any sense advocating them.  These reductions are as follows:  1. Contraction of the scope of the French service by about 50 per cent. ...2. Abolition of the Dutch service      ...      ...      ......3. Curtailment of the Italian service..................4. Integration of the Austrian and German services with some reduction and change in the scope of the programmes............5. Curtailment of the European Talks and Features Section ...6. Total abolition of the Afrikaans service   ...      ...      ...      ...7. Replacement of &quot; London Calling &quot; (a weekly programme paper) by an outline programme schedule8. Curtailment of North American service    ...      ...      ...      ...9. Consequential reduction in transmitter operations10. Reduced use of the Crowborough medium-wave transmitter (nominal)...11. Other consequential savings ...In addition, we recommend the two following economies which arenot included in the proposals which the B.B.C. themselves would beprepared; albeit very reluctantly, to contemplate:  12.   Abolition of the Portuguese service13.   Abolition of the. Norwegian, Swedish and Danish services       ......Total.say,43. Moreover, certain other economies may be found possible. For example,it may be practicable, if we can regard Western Europe as a more or lesshomogeneous area, to centralise the production of broadcast material for european countries to a greater extent, and to confine the functions of the regional editorsto the selection and translation of suitable items from a body of material centrallyproduced in common form instead of requiring them to construct programmesspecially adapted to the requirements of particular countries. There may also be room for some saving by the elimination, as far as possible, of the multipletransmission of individual programmes. And it is for consideration whether thescale of the Corporation^ transmissions to Iron Curtain countries might not bereduced to some extent, if the United States were disposed to fill the gap. Theseare tentative suggestions, which might be further explored.Expansion of B.B.C. Services44. On the other hand, there are certain directions in which the Corporation^external services need to be expanded and reinforced if the redeployment of theireffort as a whole is to be as effective as possible. The Cabinet have already approved in principle (C.C. (57) 6th Conclusions, Minute 5) the proposals that the B.B.C.&apos;sArabic service should be increased from 4J hours to 9\ hours a day; that theSharq-al-Adna transmitter should be purchased by the Government and be madeavailable to the B.B.C. to relay broadcasts from this country; and that a secondtransmitter should be installed in Cyprus (at an estimated capital cost of about 100,000; which is included in the Appendix), to operate a &quot; light&quot; programmeAmount 65,00012,00010,00015,0005,0004,00012,0005.0005,0001,0005,0001 1 C\C\f\li,UOU48,000199,000200,00051756
Total    ...      ...      ..................       258,000(c) Capital facilities47. There is no point in a proposal to expand the B.B.C.&apos;s services unless theCorporation are enabled at the same time to overhaul their equipment, to replaceit where it is obsolescent, and to modernise their technical facilities as a whole. TheDrogheda Committee recommended a programme of expenditure amounting toabout  500,000 a year over a period of 5-10 years, attributable entirely to theestablishment of new relay stations overseas. Little, if anything, has been done to give effect to this recommendation; and in the meantime the efficiency of theB.B.C.&apos;s existing installations in this country has further declined. It is now urgentthat action should be taken to enable the Corporation to compete on equal terms with its rivals.48. As a result of the increasing congestion of the ether, reception in europe is often marred by interference, and listening on both short and medium wave hasbecome less attractive than formerly. This state of affairs may be expected tobecome progressively worse, especially in view of the large amount of jamming bytransmitters in Russia and other Eastern European countries. The deterioration in the medium wave and short wave bands has been accompanied by the advent of television and VHF broadcasting.  Although these services carry, as yet, only a.-directed to the masses in Arab countries. Action on the first two proposals is inhand; and discussions are proceeding on the details of the establishment of acommercial organisation to run a &quot; light&quot; programme, the main purpose of whichwould be to transmit a service which, by its widespread appeal to the masses, woulddivert listening attention in the Middle East from other and less desirableprogrammes. If this project can be launched, we shall considerably strengthen ourtransmitting power in a key area where at present we have under our own direct control only 110 kW. out of a total of nearly 1,700 kW. of medium wave in thearea as a whole. The completion of this project is therefore a matter of very high priority. Geographically, there is no satisfactory alternative to Cyprus as a stationfrom which to broadcast effectively to Egypt, the Levant and the oil-producingStates.45. The type of station envisaged in Cyprus may need to be duplicatedelsewhere in the Middle East. Some such proposals, of which we have beeninformed, raise considerations, both political and financial, which fall outside theproper scope of our enquiry. But we recommend that, in so far as proposals maybe put forward for the expansion of broadcast services to the Middle East, they need to be considered urgently and sympathetically, if we are to make the most ofthe opportunities open to us in an area where, out of a total population of nearly80 million, about 70 million are illiterate, and are therefore dominated, to anabnormal extent, by the spoken word.46. In addition, we put forward, after discussion in most cases with theB.B.C., the following recommendations in Priority I:  Item Amount 1. Restoration of the General Overseas Service from 21 to 24 hours daily.This measure, which was recommended by the Drogheda Committeeand would do no more than reverse an arbitrary economy cut in1951-52, would enable the Corporation to close the two gaps in theservice which at present deprive the West Indies and the Pacific areaof broadcasts at a good listening time. (This recommendation is dependent on an improvement in the effectiveness of the transmission,discussed under &quot; Capital Facilities &quot; below).........      ... 50,0002. Expansion of sound transcription service output (in English and latin american, and special projects for other services). This would leadto a greater use by local stations in the Commonwealth, the colonies and foreign countries of British programmes............ 50,0003. Further developments in programme expenditure, publicity and audienceresearch, with particular emphasis on audience research as a meansof ensuring the most economic deployment of effort......... 50,0004.   Extension of two quarter-hours weekly to daily half-hour services inHausa, Somali and Swahili     ..................        30,0005.   Increase of news staff for greater specialisation of output......... 18,0006.   Expansion of service to Russia and Poland ...      ...      ...      ... 10,0007.   Consequential increase in revenue overheads (including expanded use of english by radio) and improvement of transmitter coverage, say    ... 50,000
short distance, and cannot be used in direct oversea broadcasting, their further development will cause medium and short wave listening to decline still more.For the future, therefore, we shall have to rely increasingly on securing the localrelay on medium wave of United Kingdom broadcasts, on replacing directbroadcasts by sound and television transcripts, and on increasing the power andcoverage of the existing transmission system. We have suggested, in paragraph 46above, that an additional  50,000 a year should be made available to the B.B.C. forthe expansion of the sound transcription service; and we deal, in paragraphs 53to 68 below, with the manner in which we consider that an extension of the television services would best be achieved in the initial stages. There remain thequestions of the replacement and modernisation of the Corporation^ existingtransmission facilities and the establishment of additional relay stations overseas.49. As regards the transmission outlets in the United Kingdom, theCorporation have themselves put forward the following programme, based on thefact that all the short-wave transmitters now in use in this country were installedbetween the years 1932 and 1943 and are now either obsolete or becomingobsolescent by modern standards:  (a) Two of the transmitters at Daventry currently carrying services directed tothe USSR, South-East Europe and the Middle East are obsolete and areincapable of competing under modern conditions. (They were, in fact the two transmitters on which the original Empire Service started aslong ago as 1932.) These transmitters should now be replaced bymodern 100 kW. transmitters, at a cost of about  150,000, of which 100,000 would need to be spent in the current financial year and thebalance in 1958-59.(b). Two further transmitters at Daventry, which were installed in 1937, are capable of only half the power output of those subsequently installed,and require to be replaced, at a cost of about  130,000, to be spent inthe year 1958-59.(c) A long-term programme for the progressive replacement of all theremaining transmitters is required, at a cost of about  150,000 perannum over a period of about fifteen years, at the end of which the lasttransmitter to be replaced would be nearly thirty years old.(d) Improved wave-changing facilities and aerial switching arrangements arerequired on six of the transmitters installed nearly fifteen years ago,in order to enable them to cope with the changed demands resultingfrom deliberate jamming and the shorter programmes which have been introduced since 1943. The cost would be about  40,000, to be spent in the financial year 1958-59.(e) With one exception the transmitting aerials currently in use are of the typeoriginally developed in 1938. A programme of modernisation is now required, involving capital expenditure of the order of  20,000 perannum for a period of up to five years from 1958.50. These proposals would involve additional demands on the Exchequer onthe following scale:     1. 1957-58: Under (a) above ......... 100,0002. 1958-59: Under (a) above        .........      50,000Under (b) above .........     130,000Under (c) above        .........     150,000Under (d) above        .........      40,000Under (e) above        .........      20,000Total     ... 390,000150,00020,000Total     ... 170,000a year4. For the following ten years:Under (c) above......      ... 150,000a year51. As regards new relay stations overseas, the Drogheda Committee took note of proposals for the establishment of such stations in the Caribbean, W. Africa,the Pacific area and the Middle East.  But they stated that they were not in a3. For the next four years:Under (c) aboveUnder (e) above
position to examine these projects closely or to judge their relative merits; andthey confined their positive recommendation to the proposal that the station atTebrau in Malaya, which had been limited to only half the capacity originallyplanned, should be completed. For various reasons this step has still not beentaken; and the Tebrau station reappears, together with the establishment of relaystations in the Caribbean and W. Africa, in the proposals which the B.B.C. have submitted to us. This programme is estimated to cost about  500,000 a year overa period of about six years. Capital expenditure of this order would, of course,entail a considerable increase in revenue expenditure when the new stations comeinto operation.52. We have had no opportunity to consider in detail the implications of an expansion of this kind. But we share the conviction of the Drogheda Committeethat &quot; these various proposals should be examined from the point of view that itis of prime importance to keep the technical installation of the B.B.C. up to modernstandards of efficiency.&quot; We have therefore included the relay stations in Malaya,the Caribbean and W. Africa in the Appendix, although the case for the Caribbeanstation may be rather less strong than the case for the others and should be further discussed between the Departments concerned. Subject to particular examination in this case, however, we recommend that detailed discussions with the B.B.C.should now begin on the basis that proposals of the kind described in the preceding paragraphs, both in this country and overseas, are justified in principle, their precisescope and nature being questions for expert consideration.(3) Television53. An expansion of the broadcasting system on the scale which we havesuggested in the previous section of this report can be criticised on the ground thatit ignores the rapidly growing scope of television services, and that if Exchequerfinance is available to the extent required by our proposals for broadcasting, itwould be spent to better effect if it was diverted, at least in part, to the moreup-to-date medium of television. But this criticism would miss the point. We see no reason to dissent from the opinion, expressed to us by the B.B:C, that &quot; In thefield of international broadcasting there is no prospect at all of the development of television supplanting sound transmission. What can be achieved internationallyby the two media is quite distinctive, and the immediate penetration of overseas territories by political ideas will almost certainly remain the prerogative of sound.Television is needed as an additional channel for information and for the bonds ofentertainment which mean so much.&quot;54. But although television is unlikely to replace sound broadcasting, at least in terms of international transmission, it is a- powerful and rapidly expandingauxiliary medium of communication, and our information services should be equipped to take full advantage of the opportunities which it offers.55. The demand for television material of all kinds is likely to grow rapidly,and we must expect strong competition from other countries, including the UnitedStates and the Communist bloc, in meeting this demand. The dissemination ofBritish material can therefore be of value, even if it contains no direct politicalmessage. On the other hand, the distribution of television material, especiallymaterial of a political nature, cannot be easily achieved or fully self-financing andwe must be prepared to spend both money and effort in establishing the Britishproduct. Experience has shown that entry into overseas television services cannotbe left to chance when the need arises. We should therefore seek to have a footin the door in television services in all countries which are of importance to us.56. There are two ways in which we can seek to extend the use of Britishtelevision overseas. The first is by establishing television installations abroad,equipped and operated by British interests and showing predominantly Britishprogrammes; the second is by securing the showing abroad of British television programme material.Establishment of British television services abroad57. We have considered whether there would be advantage in seeking toestablish British television services abroad as self-contained units i.e., in providingboth stations and programmes as parts of a single enterprise.  Such services would
clearly have to be run.on a commercial basis. While British television interests have so far been reasonably successful in exporting equipment, they have as yetshown no tendency to associate themselves with programme producing interests forthe purpose of providing complete television services. But even if British televisionservices could be established overseas on a commercial basis, it is doubtful whether any real advantage would generally be obtained for the presentation of the Britishviewpoint. The necessities of commercial operation would provide little scope forthe inclusion of material of a &quot;message conveying&quot; character; and in any event the Governments of the countries concerned would be likely to impose restrictionson the use of political material derived from outside sources. We have reached theconclusion, therefore, that the best means of securing the presentation of the british point of view through television services abroad lies in concentrating on making available suitable British television programme material. The Colonies may provide an exception to this general principle. In the case of the dependent territories, there may be more scope for the establishment of British television. services as self-contained enterprises. We have asked the Colonial Office to make an examination of the prospects in this direction.  This examination will not be-completed for some time. If it confirms that there are real opportunities for Britishinterests to secure &quot; package&quot; contracts for the equipment and operation of television stations, we will arrange for further consideration to be given by theDepartments concerned to the best means of approaching the firms likely to be interested.Provision of British television programme material(a) The Central Office of Information58. The Central Office of Information spend  25,000 to  30,000 a year on theproduction of material for showing on television overseas. Although this work has been developed only recently, such material has already been placed on somethirty overseas television-systems. The most important results have been secured in the United States, Canada and Australia, where our monthly television programmes have been widely shown. Significant results have also been achieved in Iraq and, to a lesser extent, in parts of Latin America.59. The material produced by the COL is under the policy direction ofthe Oversea Departments. It falls into three main categories news; material witha direct political message; and &quot;background&quot; material intended to I illustrateBritish achievements and the British way of life generally (e.g., films of thedevelopment of atomic energy for civil purposes in the United Kingdom). this material is derived from all available sources, including the news reels and newsagencies, the documentary film industry, and the Independent Televisioncontractors. The B.B.C., however, provide the C.O.I. only with news reels; it hasnot so far agreed to the acquisition by the C.O.I. of other television materialproduced for the Home Television Service.(b) The B.B.C.60. The B.B.C. supply television material to organisations in Europe-(through their membership of Eurovision) and in Commonwealth countries andthe United States (in the form of films of programmes originally, broadcast in theHome Television Service).  All this material is in English, and is provided on aselfTSUpporting basis without any Grant-in-Aid from the Oversea Departments.Proposals for Development61. Both the COT and the B.B.C. would welcome Government assistancein the development of television material. C.O.I. have submitted proposalswhereby they would offer about an hour a week of British material to the principalstations in most countries (other than behind the Iron Curtain) where televisionoperates. In particular, they would provide a weekly; Colonial News, a weeklyArabic News, a weekly news service for Latin America and corresponding service for Commonwealth countries; they would double the existing series of commonwealth televiews for Australia and Canada, and would introduce televiewsin Arabic and&apos;Latin American Spanish; and they would exploit more intensivelythe considerable material available from various United :Kingdom. sources for presentation abroad as general background to British achievements. The cost ofan expanded effort on this.scale is estimated to be of the order of  80,000 a year.
The C.O.I. should seek to make a charge for the use of its material; but if showingsare to be secured it would be unrealistic to expect that this expenditure could be recovered to an extent, initially, of more than perhaps  10,000 to  15,000.62. There are strong arguments in favour of authorising the C.O.I. to launch a programme of this kind. It is only by regarding C.O.I. as our main agent inthe development of television and by confining to C.O.I. the production of televisionmaterial with a direct political message that we can secure effective government control over the material which is produced. Moreover, C.O.I. are able to call onall available sources for material and to utilise the experience and technical facilities of British film interests in a way not open to any other agency. As regardsdistribution, they can rely on the full resources of the information posts of the oversea Departments; and in this way the same C.O.I. material can be distributedthrough media other than television (e.g., cinemas and &quot; non-theatrical &quot; showings),thus reaching audiences who have no access to television.63. Rather different arguments apply in the case of the B.B.C., who have requested a Grant-in-Aid to enable them, first, to dub (Lei, to adapt into foreignlanguages) material produced for the home television service and, second, toproduce original material not intended for showing at home but directedspecifically to the oversea audience. In favour of this proposal it can be urgedthat it would be unwise not to make full use of the B.B.C.&apos;s experience andtechnical facilities. There may well be value, from the point of view of Britishprestige, in securing the showing of television material which could be regardedas largely in the nature of entertainment (for example, plays by British authors)but would be inappropriate for production by the C.O.I. Moreover, the B.B.C.have special opportunities for securing a wide distribution of their material through their close relations with major television organisations overseas. They may,indeed, be better able than the C.O.I. to secure acceptance of their material incertain countries because of their known independence of the United KingdomGovernment. This might well prove to be the case in Canada and Australia andin other areas such as the Iron Curtain countries.64. On the other hand, unless the existing constitutional relationship betweenthe Government and the B.B.C. was modified, material produced by the B.B.C.would not be susceptible to Government control in the same way as materialproduced for the C.O.I. If we do not want the situation which has devolped in the field of sound broadcasting to apply also in relation to the new andpotentially important medium of television, we must safeguard the position fromthe outset.65. After discussing the considerations outlined in the previous paragraphswe have reached the conclusion that:  (a) In so far as the various agencies concerned with the promotion of televisionoverseas, including the B.B.C., can secure the export of their ownmaterial on a commercial basis, they should be encouraged to do so.(b) In those cases where the B.B.C. (or the programme companies of theIndependent Television Authority) produce television material whichthe Government would wish, for reasons of policy, to have exhibited inan overseas area where commercial showing would be unremunerative,the C.O.I. should be enabled to acquire the rights in that material inrespect of the area concerned, on the basis of a negotiated payment. Afresh attempt should be made to overcome B.B.C. resistance on thispoint.(c) In those cases where the Government decide that material should be specifically prepared for showing in particular areas overseas, as a deliberate instrument of information policy, the C.O.I. should be theiragent for this purpose contracting with the B.B.C., a programmecompany or a film producing company as seems appropriate. TheExchequer should bear the cost in so far as it is not covered by receipts from exhibition.66. We recognise that a good case can be made out for giving the B.B.C.Exchequer assistance for television for overseas. On the other hand an arrangement of the kind which we suggest would relieve the Corporation of any risk of loss inunremunerative markets, while not preventing them from subsequently enteringthose markets if and when greater possibilities of commercial development
appeared. At the same time it would enable the Government to make their own arrangements, through the C.O.I., for the showing of B.B.C. material in areas whichare politically important although commercially unprofitable; and by reserving toC.O.I. the right to produce material specifically designed to convey a political or economic message to certain areas of the world, it would ensure that the content and presentation of this message would remain under Government direction, andthat there would be no risk of either the Government or the B.B.C. being involvedin the type of embarrassment which, as experience with sound broadcasting hasshown, is always liable to arise if the Government attempt to &quot; control &quot; the content of the Corporation^ programmes.67. On balance, therefore, we recommend an arrangement of the typedescribed in paragraph 66 above. But we suggest that this arrangement shouldnot be regarded as a deliberate decision by the Government &quot; against&quot; the B.B.C.and &quot; in favour of &quot; the C.O.I., or as indicating that the C.O.I. are to be permanentlythe Governments only &quot; chosen instrument&quot; for the expansion of televisionoverseas. This service is still in a very early and experimental stage. The lines on which it will develop and develop rapidly in future years cannot now before seen. The arrangement should therefore be regarded as the best which can bemade for the time being but as liable to review in the light of changing circumstances.IV. THE CO-ORDINATION OF INFORMATION POLICY68. In Part II of this report we have outlined the measures which we suggestshould be taken if we are to have an efficient organisation &quot; in the field &quot; (and &quot; inthe air&quot; also) for the deployment of our information services overseas. Thecomplement of such an organisation is a focus of co-ordination at home. In thisconcluding section of our report we offer some suggestions about the way in which such a focus might be organised and the functions which it might fulfil.69. We assume the continued existence of a Ministerial Committee on oversea information Services. Under its supervision and guidance an official body shouldbe established, providing for representation of the Departments primarily concerned the three oversea Departments, the Board of Trade and the Ministry ofDefence in a small compact committee, which would constitute a convenientmeeting place for the Departmental officers whose whole-time daily business it is totranslate the policy decisions of the Government into effective publicity. It should meet regularly, at not too frequent intervals.70. This Committee structure should not derogate in any way from theresponsibility of individual Ministers for the work of their staffs oversea. It shouldnot interfere with the day-to-day operations of Departments. In short, it shouldnot seek, or be allowed, to become the nucleus of a new Ministry of Information.On the other hand, experience has shown the need for a central point to which those engaged in information work, whether at home or abroad, can look for help and advice on the presentation of those aspects of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments policywhich are engaging the attention of overseas opinion at any particular moment. Welack, at present, an organised, communal and regular opportunity for discussingpossible themes on which our publicity might concentrate to advantage; for examining suggestions for improvement from posts abroad as well as fromDepartments at home; for exchanging ideas and experiences; and for locating thesensitive areas of world opinion and defining the troublesome issues of presentation,so that the emphasis of our publicity can be adjusted, quickly and efficiently, tomeet changes in political, economic and strategic circumstances. All these thingsneed to be done, not by separate Departments acting individually, but by a sharedeffort.71. The same kind of integrated approach is needed towards other longer-term problems which we have not yet been able to examine in detail. We havebeen made aware, for example, of the difficult question of the recruitment, training and terms of service of Information Officers; and we believe that further thought should be given to the possibility of establishing an Information Service, whichwould provide career opportunities. We have also had some opportunity to appreciate the link which exists and could, with advantage, be strengthened between informational activity and trade policy. It would be desirable, in any case,that the Board of Trade&apos;s interest in the oversea information services should, if51756d
possible, be more clearly defined in the Estimates presentation of those services.But there is also scope for a more detailed examination both of the relationship between Information Officers and the various oversea posts whose occupants areconcerned with export promotion and the advertisement of British products andof the general support (not excluding, in some cases, financial assistance) which british industry as a whole might be persuaded to provide for our information services. All these are questions which a standing committee could usefully examine.72. Moreover, in planning our information policy, we must be equipped to look well ahead, not merely in terms of the content of publicity but also in terms ofthe scale of the effort which we deploy. We have been impressed by the emphasiswhich all Departments and agencies place on the importance of stability in this field and the need to avoid arbitrary and haphazard changes. We have thereforerequested each of the oversea Departments and the British Council to produce a plan, showing how its information service could be most effectively developed overthe next five years. One of the first tasks of the new committee should be to examine these plans in detail, and to seek to ensure that the demands of economy arereconciled with the desirability of securing for the information services as a wholea reasonable continuity of policy and administration and the possibility of steadyand progressive development. For this purpose, the Committee should also review,each year, the annual Estimates for the information services of the overseaDepartments and the B.B.C., in order to ensure that these services are treated as awhole, and that, where expansion is desirable or economy is inevitable, the adjustment is made in the manner most likely to reinforce our information policy asan integrated unit.73. A review of this kind would be concerned primarily as we have beenin this report with the efficiency of the information services considered on their merits. This does not mean that it would be, or that we have been, indifferent tothe financial implications. But it is idle to suppose that we can compete with theinformation effort of other countries or can achieve any success in &quot; putting across &quot;the British viewpoint in the increasingly troubled world of to-day unless we areprepared to spend a reasonable amount of money for this purpose. The currentprovision for the Oversea Information Services in 1957-58 Estimates is slighty more than  13 millions. The proposals listed as Priority I in the appendix to thisreport would involve additional expenditure in a full year (which would not bereached, in some cases, for four or five years) of nearly  2 millions. (In the first year, the amount involved would be less than half this figure.) In addition, thecapital items envisage a programme of expenditure amounting in total (if the carribbean relay station is included) to about  5^ millions, spread over fourteen years but concentrated mainly in the next five years. The expansion which we envisageis, therefore, of the order of 15 per cent, in terms of annual revenue expenditure.Nevertheless, we believe that an intensification of our effort on this scale is inevitable if we are to maintain our information services at a level which will be consistent with our world-wide responsibilities and will ensure the maximumreinforcement of our political, economic and strategic policies.74. We repeat, and endorse, the statement in the Drogheda Report that&quot; The Information Services must to-day be regarded as part of the normal apparatusof diplomacy of a Great Power.&quot; But relatively little has been done in the fouryears since that report was published to give effect to many of the recommendations which the Drogheda Committee then regarded as already urgent. In the intervalwe have fallen dangerously far behind our competitors and our enemies. Theexisting level of our information services &quot; in the field &quot; and of the technicalfacilities which supply and support them is now inadequate to the responsibilities which we carry; and we cannot afford not to make good these deficiencies.V.-SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS75. The main conclusions emerging from our enquiry can be summarised asfollows:  (a) Our information services should be deployed in accordance with certainbasic principles (paragraph 7).(b) The expansion of the Oversea Information Services which we recommendis indicated in the Appendix to this Report, where the proposals whicht
we have considered are graded in three categories of priority. Thoseprojects which appear in Priority I are necessary and urgent. if additional resources can be made available the projects listed underPriority II are desirable; the projects in Priority III have had a casemade out for them.(c) The possibility of progressively and substantially reducing Foreign Officeexpenditure on information services in Western Germany should befurther examined (paragraph 12).(d) The Board of Trade should keep under review the possibility of launchinga new scheme for promoting the export of books (paragraph 15).(e) Action should be taken in various respects to promote vigorously the teaching of English. The proposals indicated in paragraphs 22-25should be discussed with local education authorities before the details are finalised. Legislation will probably be needed to enable theEducation Ministers to assume responsibility for training teachers,whether United Kingdom citizens or otherwise, for the express purposeof serving overseas.(/) As regards sound broadcasting, the relationship between the B.B.C. and her Majesty&apos;s Government should continue to be based upon the 1952Licence and Agreement with the B.B.C. (paragraphs 30-34).(g) The external services of the B.B.C. should be redeployed on the lines indicated in paragraphs 42-43 and in paragraph 46.(h) Approval should be given in principle to a programme of capitalre-equipment of the B.B.C., both in the United Kingdom and abroad,on the lines indicated in paragraphs 49-52. Thereafter, and subject tofurther examination of the desirability of establishing a relay station in the Caribbean, the proposals indicated in those paragraphs shouldbe discussed in detail&quot; With &quot;the B.B.C. in order to establish the properscope and nature of a phased programme of re-equipment.(/) The development of British television abroad should, in general, take theform of an effort to secure the showing overseas of British television programme material. In the Colonies, however, there may be morescope for the establishment of British television services asself-contained enterprises; and the possibilities in this direction shouldbe further examined (paragraph 57).(/) Excheqeur assistance for the expansion of British television abroad shouldbe concentrated on the preparation by the Central Office ofInformation of material specifically prepared for oversea showing. TheB.B.C. and other agencies should be encouraged to promote the exportof their own material on a commercial basis, on the understanding that,in those cases where exhibition in a particular area would becommercially unremunerative but politically advantageous, the C.O.I.should be enabled to acquire the rights in respect of the area concerned on the basis of a negotiated payment (paragraphs 61-68).(k) A standing Ministerial Committee on Oversea Information Services shouldbe established. An inter-departmental Committee should also be setup, to provide, under the supervision and guidance of the ministerial committee, a means of co-ordinating policy and of examining longer term problems concerning the structure and organisation of the oversea information Services (paragraphs 69-73).(/) An approximate estimate of the cost of our recommendations is containedin the table below. The full year cost would not be reached, in thecase of a good many of the individual proposals, for three or four years.I.
