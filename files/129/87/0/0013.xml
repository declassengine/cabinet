(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 1134th May, 1957MALTAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies on 17th April the C binet invited me to arrange for my proposals(C. (57) 98) for a five-year trial period to be further examined by the officials and subsequently by the Malta Committee (C. C. (57) 35thConclusions, Minute 6).    This I have now done.2.      I understood my colleagues in the Malta Committee to agree, a tour meeting on 3rd May, that, if the Prime Minister, Mr. Mintoff cannotbe persuaded to accept our offer made at the recent London talks, theproposal for a five-year trial period was in principle preferable to thealternative courses which appear to be open to us in the presentsituation.    These are to stand on the present dyarchy or to abandonintegration and allow Mr. Mintoff to campaign for independence, with a defence agreement.3.      There was, however, a general feeling that we should not over-emphasise the possibility of ultimately attaining comparable living standards;  and not commit ourselves at this stage to the setting up of aCommission at the end of the five-year period to review the progress made in developing the economy of Malta.    On the constitutional arrangements, there appeared to be general acceptance of the view thatit would not be desirable or practicable to propose any substantialalteration in the arrangements proposed under the integration planexcept, of course, those consequent upon the withholding of representa-tion at Westminster.    On the economic arrangements, there was generalagreement that the substance of our proposals for capital and recurrentassistance should remain unchanged, although the Chancellor of theExchequer wished to give further thought to the question of percentagegrants to social services and to the level of the minimum recurrentassistance to be guaranteed,,    Both he and the Minister of Defencestressed the need to be more cautious in our offer of assistance in theevent of unemployment in Malta.    They had in mind the drastic changesin Imperial defence policy which might have to be made in the nearfuture and which might involve reducing employment in the Malta dock-yard by more than half and reducing other deferice expenditure in thesame proportion.4.      Our present obligations towards the maintenance of employmentin Malta are expressed in the statement of economic principles agreed by the two Maltese Parties and Her Majestyrs Government in the July,1955 discussions (Appendix I).    This refers to the objectives of&quot;increasing    substantially opportunities for employment outsideCOPY NO.CABINET
service establishments;  and avoiding unemployment&quot;.    In a sense this obligation is wider than that proposed under the integration plan but inany case we have a moral obligation to give Malta special help shouldunemployment arise from defence cuts, because of the almost completedependence of the Maltese economy on defence expenditure whichmarks Malta&apos;s difference from dockyards or ordnance factories in theUnited Kingdom which may be affected by defence cuts.5.      I sympathise with the view of the Minister of Defence that we need urgently to consider what remedial measures can be taken to dealwith heavy unemployment in Malta.     This we must do whateverconstitutional plan is followed.    The obvious answer is to step upassistance to emigration with the co-operation of the receiving Govern-ments in the Commonwealth.    There are other measures which mightbe suggested but they would all be theoretical until we knew exactly what cuts in defence expenditure and manpower were proposed, how they were to be phased, and what the economic situation of Malta wouldbe like at the time.     I propose with the co-operation of my colleagues to initiate an urgent enquiry into these matters for we may be confronted with a situation comparable to that which obliged us toappoint Commissioners for the distressed areas here in the 1930s.But I do not think we can delay a decision on the five-year trial perioduntil this has been considered.6.      We have told Mr. Mintoff that we would try to give him an answerby 7th May.    There can be no certainty that a five-year trial period willappeal to Mr. Mintoff but if we are not prepared to go further on ourintegration proposals - and I may have something to say on this afterseeing the Governor over the week-end - we must make this further attempt to resolve the deadlock.7.      On this basis I seek authority to put to Mr. Mintoff the alternative of accepting our recent integration proposals or of opting for a five-year trial period.     I would then propose to initiate a new round of discussions with him.    If Mr. Mintoff were to go for the five-yeartrial period, I would offer constitutional and economic proposals broadlyon the lines previously offered under the integration plan but withcertain amendments, which I hope will meet the points made by mycolleagues in the Malta Committee.    I set out in Appendix II the termsof our previous offer and side by side the proposals for a five-year trial period on which the new negotiations would be based.A.L.B.Colonial Office, S. W. 1.3rd May, 1957.
AGREED STATEMENT ON THE SOCIAL AND economic development OF MALTA ISSUED AFTER THEDISCUSSIONS WITH MALTESE PARTY leaders in JUNE-JULY, 1955All parties to the Conference are agreed that the social andeconomic development of Malta is a necessity and calls for a joint and sustained effort by both countries.    To assure the steady advance ofthe Islands a long-term development plan is being prepared.Meanwhile, as part of the effort to improve the living standards of the Maltese people, the Conference endorses the following objectives(i)  raising the standard of education and other social services;(ii)  increasing substantially opportunities for employ-ment outside Service establishments;  and(iii) avoiding unemployment.It is recognised by the United Kingdom Government and by the MalteseDelegations that improved living standards can fee maintained only by increasing productivity and expanding the national income of Malta.With this in view, Her Majesty&apos;s Government on their part undertaketo contribute to the cost of the necessary capital works, to help securethe technical means and, in the interim period before these measureslead to the required expansion in Maltars own revenues, to assist asmay prove necessary in balancing the budget on recurrent account.The Maltese Delegations on their part recognise that the long-term development plan needs detailed elaboration and examination and each delegation pledges its close co-operation with Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in this common task.    They also recognise that the degreeof success attained will depend on the hard work and self-discipline ofthe Maltese people and on the Maltese Government and people makingthe best possible contribution from their own resources.
Economic and Constitutional proposals the following are the economic and constitutional proposals which were offered under the integration plan side by side with those which would appear to .he appropriate to the five-year trial period^IntegrationPREAMBLE1 .     The United Kingdom Government have every sympathy with the Maltese Governmentin their efforts to improve the standardof living of the Maltese people, andthe United Kingdom Government fully recognise, that further financial assistanceto this end will be required by Maltafor a number of years.live Year Trial1.     The Governments of Malta andthe United Kingdom hereby affirmtheir desire to bring about closer association.     In the light of amore detailed study of the practicalissues involved, particularly onthe economic side, than the malta Round Table Conference was able to undertake, the twoGovernments have reached theconclusion that while there is nochange in their objective, it isnot yet possible for them to agree on constitutional and economic arrangements, of a final and permanent character.     The maltese government consider that the representation of Malta in theUnited Kingdom Parliament must be&apos;accompanied by a guarantee thatcomparable living standards willbe provided for the Maltese peoplewithin a period of years.     TheUnited Kingdom Government on theother hand consider that Malta1sprogress towards the ultimate aim should depend principally on thesuccess of the productivity drive in malta to which they will give everyaid.The Maltese Government haveexpressed the view that whereasboth Governments had agreed to devise what is a permanentconstitutional solution, the economic arrangements proposed by HerMajestyfs Government did not on theother hand ensure a permanent solution but only mapped out thecourse for the next five years.They maintained that theconstitutional and economic arrangements should be on a similar basis.2.     The objective of this memorandum istwo-fold.     First it seeks to define the long-term objectives which,in consequence of the new constitutional relationship, both theUnited Kingdom and MalteseGovernments wish to see as the guidingprinciples which should govern whatever2.        In the circumstances, thetwo Governments have directedtheir efforts towards devisingarrangements to cover a period offive years, during which time Maltawill not be represented in theUnited Kingdom Parliament,     At theend of the five years, the two
financial arrangements are agreedupon between them.     Secondly, itsets out the financial arrangements which the United Kingdom Governmentare prepared to make in furtherance of the long-term objectives.Governments will consult together on the working of the constitutional arrangements and will review theprogress made in developing the economy of Malta,     In the lightof this consultation and review, thetwo Governments will consider whetherthe time has come to pursue thecommon objective and to reach agreement on permanentconstitutional and economic arrangements.I.   OBJECTIVES OF POUCY3.   Her Majesty&apos;s Government approveand support the ultimate aim of the maltese Government, namely, that the islands should reach an economy and a standard of living comparable to thatof the United Kingdom.3.        On the basis of the fore-going declaration, the twoGovernments now agree on thefollowing economic and constitutional arrangements.The two Governments agree thatthis aim will take time to achieve andthat in the interim period special measures- are needed to improve the productivity of the Islands and generally to help the Maltese people forward especially on suchmatters as education and other social benefits.It will be open to the maltese government after a period of 12 to 15years to request that their economybecome an integral part of that of theUnited Kingdom when direct and indirect taxation, rates and socialcontributions would be levied on theUnited Kingdom pattern.Both Governments agree that anysuch change would only be appropriatewhen the productivity drive has succeeded in bringing the economy of malta to a level which, taking accountof all relevant factors, is comparable to that of the United Kingdom.     the maltese Government recognises theobligation of the Maltese people to makesustained efforts to achieve this aim.4.     The Maltese Government will draw up 4. for paragraph 4 opposite.^/plans aimed at increasing the productivity and the living standards and expanding the national income of Malta.In drawing up these plans, account will betaken of the need;-(a)   to diversify the economy and inparticular to create opportunities for industrial development,including tourism, designed to make possible the economic viability of the islands, and to reduce its dependence on United Kingdom contributions;
(b) to raise the standard ofeducation, health and social welfare;(c) to maintain full employment;(d) to provide positiveincentives to emigration.II.   FINANCIAL ARPANGFJVTENTS5.    As a first step towards the attainment of the objectives of policy set out inSection I above, and bearing in mind -cheneed to increase the productivity and develop the economy of the Islands inorder to enable social services and living standards to be progressivelyincreased, the following financial arrangements for a capital programme and for recurrent expenditure will apply to the first five years afterthe change in constitutional status:(i) Capital programme.     The United Kingdom Government&apos;contribution to the capital development programme shall be approximately  25 millions of which not more than around  5 millionsshall be issued in any one year.This assistance will be broughtto account by the Maltese government as part of the revenues of Malta.7*      The capital budget will consist of all development works orprojects, including all war damage and reconstruction works and projectsappropriate to the war damage and reconstruction grant under the malta (Reconstruction) Act 194-7*8.      During this period the fixedcontribution to capital developmentmade by the United Kingdom Governmentwill consist of:-(a)    the balance of the war damagegrant in the ConsolidatedRevenue Fund of the Governmentof the United Kingdom until this grant is exhausted,amounting to   at.        In furtherance of theagreement between the two Govern-mints, and bearing in mind theneed to increase productivity and develop the economy of the islands in order to enable social servicesand living standards to be progressively increased, thefollowing financial arrangementsfor a capital programme and forrecurrent expenditure will applyto the first five years afterthe change in constitutional status:(i) Capital programme.        The Maltese Government willdraw up a five-year capital development programme for submission to Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment.     On the basis of the agreed programme, the United KingdomGovernment will contribute to theprogramme up tc  25 millions, ofwhich not more than up to  millions shall be issued in anyone year.     This assistance will bebrought to account by the maltese government as part of the revenues of Malta.7./As for paragraph 7opposite.8.^/As for paragraph 8oppositely
(b) a sum equivalent to the&quot;balance of the colonial development and Welfareallocation made to Maltaamounting to  at ;(c) a sum sufficient to make good the difference between thetotal of (a) and (b) and theamount of the aggregatecontribution for the period(i.e. the  25 millions mentionedin paragraph 6 above).9.      The United Kingdom Government will use its good offices to assist the maltese Government in the establish-ment in Malta of industrial firms inorder to increase Maltese productivity and thus provide the economic basis for a steady increase in Malteseliving standards.(ii) Recurrent Expenditure10.     The recurrent budget will consistof all Governmental services not appropriate to the capital budget.The United Kingdom Government share the view of the Maltese Government as tothe importance of the development of malta&apos;s social services, especiallyeducation and health.     Moreover, theUnited Kingdom Government recognise thatthis programme will not show much return in the early years;   and they areconsequently anxious to give continuedfinancial help on an assured basis.11.     The United Kingdom government therefore undertake to make an annual contribution towards the Malteserecurrent budget for the first fiveyears, calculated as follows:In regard to the education, health and social welfare services of the maltese Government, insofar as they are regarded by both Governments as coming within the field of social services, theUnited Kingdom Government will contribute:9. for paragraph 9 opposite10.   jAs for paragraph 10 opposite11.   ^/Ss for paragraph 11  opposite(i)   in respect of education, one-third of the actual annualrecurrent cost of the education service (OR. 25 per cent of thetotal actual recurrent expendi-ture on the education service upto  1 million and 50 per cent ofany actual recurrent expenditureon that service in excess of 1 million);(ii)   in respect of the health and social welfare servioes other thaneducation, 25 per cent of the actualrecurrent cost.
Provided that:(l)    the payment by the UnitedKingdom Government under sub-paragraph (i) and (ii) abovetaken together shall be subjectto a minimum annual payment of 900,000j(2)   the Maltese Government bears thefull cost of the remainder ofthe recurrent budget,(iii)   General Provisions12.   The United Kingdom government recognise that any drastic change in imperial defence policy affecting Maltamight alter considerably the basis onwhich a capital expenditure plan was drawnup and the level of employment in Malta.In such circumstances the United KingdomGovernment would be willing to review the position.     In particular, if inconsequence of such a change in Imperialdefence policy, the level of unemploymentin Malta should reach and, for six months,remain at a higher level than the rate ofunemployment in the United Kingdom at thetime, the United Kingdom Government wouldbe vd-lling to assist the maltese government in taking remedial measures tobe agreed.13.     The Government of Malta will secure the agreement of the UnitedKingdom before raising money by loanor by temporary advances above s. levelof temporary advances reached at anytime in the 12 months ended31st March, 1958.14.     The United Kingdom parliament will be furnished annually withthe audited accounts of the maltese government.(iii)   General Provisions12.        The United Kingdom government recognise that any drastic change   in imperial defence policy affectingMalta might alter considerable?- thebasis on which a capital development programme had been drawn up, and thelevel of employment in Malta.     Insuch circumstances, the United KingdomGovernment would be willing to review the position.     In particular, if inconsequence of such a change in imperial defence policy, there shouldbe a substantial rise in unemploymentin Malta the United Kingdom Governmentwould be willing to assist the MalxeseGovernment in taking remedial measures to be agreed.     For their part the Maltese Government recognisetheir duty not to take measures,particularly in the field of Governmentemployment, v/hich would tend to makethe activities of the Services in malta economically disadvantageous.13. for paragraph 13 opposite.^14*   ^As for paragraph 14- opposite.^ITT. iu^OINTMENT OF A COMMISSION15.     The two governments agree that,towards the end of the first five year period, an independent Commission shallbe set up to review the progress made in malta, under the arrangements set out above, towards the ultimate aim of reaching an economy and a standard ofliving comparable to that of theUnited Kingdom.-    In particular it willbe the task of the Commission to examinethe progress achieved, as a result ofthe joint efforts of the two Governments,^Delete.J
in increasing the productivity and developing the economy of the Islands;to consider what further progress may be possible in these respects;   and in 1ftielight of their assessment to advise the twoGovernments on what farther measures oralternative arrangements it might be necessary  and desirable tc adopt, hearing inmind the objectives of policy as defined inSection I of this Memorandum.Note,      The contributory national insurance schemes of Malta and theUnited Kingdom and Northern Ireland are atpresent set up on a different basis.Nonetheless should the maltese government so wish Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment are very ready to consider withthe Maltese Government the implications of bringing the Maltese scheme into the samerelationship as that of Northern Irelandand the United Kingdom.
