(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE property  OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y*S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 121 COPY NO.15th May, 1957CABINETWAGES AND prices note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Labour and National ServiceWe were invited to arrange for officials to re-examinethe draft terms of reference of the proposed Advisory Council on price Stability and to consider how further unofficial approacheson this subject would best be made to management and labour.(C.C.(57) 39th Conclusions, Minute l).2. A report by officials on these points is attached.P.T.I.M.15th May, 1957.
SECRETWAGES AND PRICES:  REPORT BY OFFICIALSWe have reconsidered, in the light of the Cabinet discussionof 10th May certain questions in regard to the proposed AdvisoryCouncil on Price Stability.Terra of Appointment2.     A suggestion has been made that it might be desirable to constitute the body on a basis which would permit the Governmentto amend its method of working or even to wind it up entirely.It would be clearly desirable that the Government should say atthe outset that the body was experimental and that its development would be reviewed from time to time.     Unless, however, the bodyis from the beginning given a reasonable expectation of life, itwould appear inadequate to deal with the wages/prices problem(which is likely to yield only slowly to treatment).    In addition would be difficult to recruit suitable members for the bodyunless it was clear that they would at least have an opportunity ofmaking some impression on the problem.     We think, therefore,that appointments should be made for at least three years.Terms of Reference and Title3.      Difficult though it is to find suitable precise terms ofreference, we think these are essential.    Otherwise the body couldroam over the whole field of economic affairs.     In the light of theCabinet discussion we now suggest the following:&quot;Having regard to the desirability of securingincreased standards of life based on expandingproduction and stable prices, to keep underreview changes in productivity, prices and thelevel of incomes (including wages, salaries and profits), and to report from time to time on the significance of such changes&quot;.4.     The suggested revised terms of reference do not includeanything about full employment or high levels of employment.    Theinclusion of this might make the terms of reference clumsy and the thought is perhaps adequately provided for through the mention of increased standards of life and expanding production.5.      The title might be:&quot;The Advisory Committee on Productivity,Frices and Incomes&quot;or&quot;The Productivity, Prices and IncomesCommittee&quot;
14th May, 1957.6.     Assuming the Government accept the proposal in principle,we think that the first steps should consist of ad hoc consultation ata high official level with the representatives of industry.     these would be meetings between officials of the Treasury and theMinistry of Labour on the one hand, and representatives of industry on the other.    They would be on the basis that the Government have for some time  been   considering what further action should betaken to help restrain the upward movement of costs and prices and thinks that a body of this kind might help to provide anopportunity for a new initiative.    The object of the discussions would be to see how far industry would be ready to co-operate andto elicit their views on the proposal generally.     Separate talkswould be held with representatives of the Trades Union congress and representatives of the association of private employers (theBritish Employers&apos; Confederation and the Federation of BritishIndustries).    The National Union of Manufacturers would also be consulted.    Similar consultations would be held with representativesof the nationalised industries.    These informal official discussions would prepare the way for meetings between Ministers and the threesides of industry.    Between these informal and formal meetingsit would also be desirable to consult the Economic Planning Board,Publicity7.      The Government may be under some pressure to add to itsstatement on the recommendations of the Courts of Inquiry intothe shipbuilding and engineering disputes.     In view of this and thepossibility of a leak, it would perhaps be desirable to make a short statement as soon as the dates for the informal meetings are fixed,indicating that consultation is going on.    The position vis    -vis the Trade unions and other participants may be delicate, and itwould be well if in these initial stages no further information weregiven to the Press - e. g. about the possibility of subsequent formalmeetings between Ministers and representatives of industry.
