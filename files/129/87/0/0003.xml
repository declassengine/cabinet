(57). 10327th April, 1957CABINETWAGES, PRICES AND THE POUND STERLINGMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerIntroductionUnder existing policies the question is not whether the pound sterling will bedevalued but when. This paper is concerned with that danger. It deals with the steady injection of new purchasing power through higher wages and salaries intothe system at a time when that purchasing power is not matched by moreproduction. It sets out to demonstrate that we are steadily taking more out of thesystem than we are putting in. It proposes a new approach to the subject as abasis of discussion to be held urgently with both sides of industry.The Facts2. What are the facts? First as to the pound sterling. Figure I and Table Iin the Appendix show what has been happening to it since 1946. Its internalpurchasing power has gone and is going steadily downhill. It has sunk from a value of  1 0s. Od. in 1948 to a value of about 14s. to-day and unless we make a drastic change in our behaviour it will go on falling. In 1949 indeed we had torecognise the facts of this situation by reducing the external purchasing powerof the pound by a third.3. Obviously many factors contribute to the internal purchasing power ofa pound note. Nevertheless the most substantial factor in driving up prices over these ten years has been the increase in wage costs. Between 1948 and 1956incomes rose by 75 per cent, and output by 28 per cent. This is shown inFigure II.4. Over the period the index of retail prices has risen 60 per cent. partlythrough wages, partly through removal of subsidies and partly through higherimport prices. Figure III demonstrates the weight which should be attached tothese factors.5. It will be seen that wages are by far the largest factor in this upsurge ofprices. In the future, since subsidies have in the main been removed and import prices appear fairly steady, they will remain the dominant factor. The effect of wage increases is intensified by the addition of profit margins. It is an illusion,widely believed, that wage increases come out of profits, since in general they movetogether. Wages have risen every year since 1945, and profits in all years but one.6. The effect of price increases, on this scale, must be to undermine belief in the currency. Prices have not risen so fast in our history before, in times ofpeace.  At home, trustees are moving on a broad front from gilt-edged to equity51529b
shares, and are being followed by insurance and pension funds. Abroad, the holders of sterling balances are clearly apprehensive that another devaluation hascome within the bounds of practical politics. The reserves are constantly underthreat.7. There is a school of thought which hopes that everything will be all rightso long as everybody else behaves as badly as we do ourselves. We look wistfullytowards America and Germany and hope that they may inflate as fast or faster than we do. If they did, the damage we do might be concentrated more upon ourpensioners and less upon the relative external value of the pound. This is, however,to say the least a slender and precarious basis for our policies. The United Stateskeeps unemployment much higher than we do and after two devaluations german public opinion is determined to avoid another. In any event, with sterling asvulnerable as it is, we are more likely to be faced with a flight from the poundthrough lack of confidence in policies so manifestly profligate, than to be allowedto wait for the inevitable because of loss of competitive power.8. Thus there is a real danger that confidence in the currency will be undermined, at home and abroad. If this happened, public opinion would almost certainly compel the Government of the day to restore a stable currency. But agreat deal of harm would have been done in the process and the changes neededthen would be much more drastic and painful than preventive action now. Thearguments against any interference with our present system of wage bargaining,strong though they are, must therefore be set against the dangers to the currency.In short, we are in a situation in which we cannot avoid serious trouble by doing nothing.Causes of the Problem9. The basic cause of wage and cost increases is that the Government has accepted responsibility for full employment. The main deterrent to wage claims and the main incentive to refuse them used to be the risk of losing business becauseprices would be too high. These factors have to a remarkable degree been removed by economic events and by the actions and declarations of the Government itself.10. Against this background Trade Unions, stronger than they ever were before, have been negotiating on much wider fronts than used to be the case andchoosing (can we blame them) the front for attack where it is most vulnerable,either because the Government is involved (e.g., the railways) or because theemployers in that sector can afford to pay (e.g., the shipbuilders) and will set the pattern for the remainder.11. Thus there is no particular reason why any round of wage increases should be moderate. And indeed Trade Union leaders have been driven by thepresent position into competing with one another, if they are to keep their jobs.Most of them are probably aware of the problem but they dare not do anythingabout it. The leaders of the Labour Party are almost certainly in the same position.12. A few brave spirits in all parties and in the Trade Unions and the Presshave attempted at least to mention the perilous realities of the position. The maindanger lies, however, in the insidious nature of the disease. So far, apart from the devaluation of 1949, we have managed to maintain employment, imports and theexchange value of sterling. The hardships from rising prices are mainly felt bypensioners. Otherwise the threat of disaster is hardly felt until the disaster itselfoccurs. The house is still comfortable, though the foundations are beingundermined.Failure of Post-War Policy13. Both Labour and Conservative Governments have made continuedappeals for restraint and this has been urged in White Papers in 1947, 1948 and1956. Wages rose only slowly in 1949 and 1950, and in 1953 and 1954. But in both cases the period of restraint was followed by rapid increases. In 1956 theGovernment made a renewed appeal and at first this looked as if it might succeed.But in recent weeks it is clear that restraint has been rejected and that the current year&apos;s increase will be of the order of 6 per cent. In any case it is doubtful whetherrestraint, as put forward last year, could be a long-term policy, since it asked for changes only in exceptional circumstances and made no room for any flexibility.
The nationalised industries themselves will shortly have to increase their prices,and the &quot; plateau &quot; will be seen to have proved untenable for more than a short period.14. Almost everything that has been tried has been worth trying. Often wehave had a partial or temporary success or near-success. Nevertheless we mustfrankly admit, against the facts stated in the earlier paragraphs, that we have failed. On the path we are at present following we are moving down towards aneconomic and political disaster.The Remedies15.  The following courses are among those open to us:  (a) To go on as we are. This is always tempting in politics.  In this case asin many others it can be the most dangerous of all. We might institutesome form of enquiry into wage negotiating machinery and this might indeed be valuable. But it would be no substitute for government decisions on what to do now.(b) A severe deflation aimed at creating a fairly high level of unemployment. This would be possible to achieve over a wide field. But it is notpossible to stop wage inflation except by levels of unemployment whichwould not, I believe, be acceptable politically. Moreover, there is something economically and intellectually repulsive in creating one&apos;sown slump in order to deal with this problem.(c) Wage Fixing. Such a policy, coupled as it would have to be with the fixing or limitation of other incomes, is a logical feature of a fullyplanned society. It might, with much else distasteful, follow anotherdevaluation. I do not recommend it.(d) Subsidy. A kind of half-way house has been tried by faking pricesthrough subsidies from the taxpayer. Price subsidies of this kind can take the form either of direct consumer subsidies (e.g., the bread and milk subsidies) or can be used to subsidise the basic industries, e.g., asis now happening in transport. Such a policy is costly. Its cost,moreover, tends to rise since it generates in a large measure its owninflation. Unless it is matched by high taxes it is of course dangerouslyinflationary. Even when so matched, prices are raised to pay the taxesor paper money is printed to finance the industries. When such a policyis abandoned a further argument for wage increases is immediatelyprovided.A New Approach16. Nevertheless we cannot go on as we are. If we do not want heavyunemployment and reject wage fixing or a return to the subsidy policy which gotSir Stafford Cripps into such difficulties, we must find some alternative approach.At present it is widely held that collective bargaining is a fundamental right andthat the Government should act as a mediator it must not take sides, must try toavoid stoppages and prevent strife. This attitude is an anachronism. It is thepublic and the currency which suffer from higher costs and prices, not the employer.And if the Government will not give a positive lead no one else can. In acceptingresponsibility for full employment, the Government has perforce acceptedresponsibility for the balance of payments and for sterling. We cannot in thesecircumstances adopt a negative approach to wage problems.17. No remedy can be easy if it were it would have been found already. but what is needed is to change the attitude of the country towards unrestrictedcollective bargaining, or at any rate to make public opinion realise that it cannot have this, full employment, and price stability at the same time. If the country is determined to wreck its currency, the Government should at least see that it knowswhat it is doing. It is obvious from the pressure continually exerted on ministers that the country thinks the Government is responsible for price stability. Far from what is believed by public opinion, the Governments interest is much more opposedto excessive wage increases than those of either the employers or the workers, bothof whom benefit from inflation at the expense of those with fixed incomes, at least until the disaster happens.51529
18. Clearly the Government cannot legislate for wages, since it is impossibleto enforce such legislation on workers as a whole. Nor can it intervene toprevent or to break strikes except where the life of the community is at stake.But it must take a positive attitude and hold it irrespective of transitory events oropinions. And it must translate this attitude into action in those sectors whereit exercises direct influence and do everything possible to prevent others from acting in a contrary way in other sectors, even if this leads to strikes.19. If, however, it is to do this it must have a policy on wages and see thatthe employers, the Trade Unions, and the nation know what that policy is. A vaguereluctance to see wages go up is really not enough. A wage policy should not be apolicy of immobility. It should be a policy aimed to secure that wages do infact go up, but go up within the range of what we as a nation have earned from ourproductive effort.20. To do this, the Government should announce from time to time theamount of wage increases it thinks are consistent with price stability, and stickto this until the next time, e.g., once a year or once in two years. This would enablethe Government to make it clear that they do not seek to freeze wages at the present level and that, on the contrary, they believe that real wages should increase steadily.It would also have the advantage that everyone will know where the Governmentstands and that if there is any public opinion in favour of stability, this will give ita rallying point. At present almost any settlement is welcomed because it isthought to be better than a dispute. Clearly such a course is fraught with difficulty and danger.  But so is our present situation.21. The major difficulty is, of course, that such a step is really a severelimitation on free collective bargaining to which British industry is deeply attached.As already pointed out, this attitude is an anachronism from the days before full employment. While it must be for the Government to formulate its policy, itis clear that no policy of this kind could have much hope of success unless theground were carefully prepared with both sides of industry.22. There are also a number of practical difficulties to which answers wouldhave to be found before announcing any policy on these lines. Among the points which need discussion would be the following:  (a) How is the figure to be settled?  It ought to represent the expected average increase in productivity for the country as a whole. It does not mattermuch, in theory or practice, whether the first figure is right as it wouldhave to be adjusted yearly by trial and error. But it would haveenormous emotional interest so that if it could be fixed by an impartialbody it would help. Any such body would need to have, and would almost certainly demand, the help of Government statistical andeconomic advice. But once a figure was announced the Governmentwould have to give it active support.(b) Prices. If the figure was reasonably correct, and made effective, and import prices did not rise, the price level as a whole would remainsteady. This would mean that some prices would rise and others fall.It is for consideration whether the Government should take moreinterest in prices than it does now. A policy of subsidising prices wouldbe either inflationary, or would require to be offset by taxes. failure by the nationalised bodies to provide adequate finance for their owndevelopment would have similar effects. It may, however, be possibleto influence prices through tax policy. For example, it might be wise to give tax relief (where possible) by concessions in indirect ratherthan direct taxation (which would incidentally have the advantage ofbenefiting the lower income ranges) and to impose new taxes if needed on direct rather than indirect fields.(c) Wage differentials. Changes in relative wages perform an essentialeconomic function in getting labour where it is needed. It would be undesirable to freeze the existing pattern, though this would be a cheapprice to pay for general stability. There would, of course, still be room for both sides would be able to ask for higher or lower increasesthan the normal figure, if they could demonstrate that there were specialeconomic circumstances. And in addition industrial negotiations would still be needed on matters which have little to do with wages such asredundancy, demarcation, restrictive practices, pensions, &amp;c.    .
The prescription of a norm in regard to wage increases presents a difficult practical problem. On the one hand it would be useless, and[indeed undesirable, to try to settle ah these matters in advance and desirable to have some elasticity. On the other, it would be dangerous to have so much latitude as to leave room for restartingcompetitive bargaining. However, there can be little doubt that ifpublic opinion would accept the major change, the British talent for not pushing things to their logical conclusions would settle the minorones. The essential aim would be to ensure that it was fully recognisedthat special cases would need to be proved, since any privileges grantedwould be at the expense of other workers and of the country as a whole.id) Government-controlled Wages. Clearly the Government would have togive a lead both to show that it meant what it said and to create avested interest against industries which tried to go beyond what theGovernment had given its own servants. It would therefore bedesirable to announce increases (perhaps at intervals of several years)for Civil Servants, teachers, doctors, &amp;c.; and also to encouragesettlements on the same basis for the nationalised industries.(e) Sanctions.-As already stated, wages cannot be fixed by law except ina totalitarian State, because of the practical difficulties of enforcement.The primary sanction would have to be public opinion. But theGovernment would have to take sides (or if necessary oppose bothsides): and it would have to be willing to face a. strike or strikes. the damage done to the economy by strikes is usually less than most peoplethink.if) Dividends, Profits, &amp;c. Although it can be shown that if there are nomonopoly elements present, neither dividends nor profits will have thedynamic role in prices increases which are played by wages, it is clearthat it is very difficult to convince the Trade Unions of this. The main difficulty from an economic point of view about either profit or dividendlimitation is that variations in the demand for an industry&apos;s productshas a much wider effect on these than on wages, which are cushionedfrom such variations by profits themselves. If profits or dividends are limited, therefore, the pattern of industry tends to be frozen in a muchmore damaging way than if wage differentials are frozen. A good dealof consideration would have to be given to what was possible in this field. It seems likely that some price would have to be paid, in the formof accepting measures economically undesirable or politically difficult,to give a reasonable chance of reaching the greater good of price stability.(g) Changes in Existing Machinery or the Creation of New Machinery. -Consideration would have to be given, mainly by the Ministry ofLabour, to the role of existing wage-making bodies, such as WagesBoards, Arbitration Tribunals and so on. In the first instance, it wouldprobably be sufficient to ensure that the independent members were aware of Government policy. But an anomalous situation would be created if, for example, an award was given legal force which was at variance with stated public policy.The whole complex of questions about wage differentials, prices and dividends suggests that there should be a place for at least advisoryopinions as to whether particular variations in any of these were, or were not, reasonable having regard to all the circumstances. It is notvery likely that employers would wish to charge prices or to paydividends which could not be defended, so that an advisory service would give them some protection. The attitude of the Trade unions would depend on whether they were prepared to give the proposedsystem a chance.(h) Transition. A successful policy, once established, should steady the costof living and thus eliminate that excuse for wage increases. But thereare already in the pipeline increases in prices arising out of the presentround of wage increases and out of other increased costs not yet passed on.   A complete break with the practice of increases related to the
increased cost of living in the transition to a new system may be impracticable. But the full corresponding increase in wages could notbe allowed, for that would merely breed further increases in costs andso on. There may be a case for a tapering adjustment.Conclusions23. The argument on which the paper is based is that full employment and stable prices are both things which are desired by the community, and that theseare inconsistent with completely free industrial bargaining. I do not believe that itis impossible to persuade the public or the Trade Unions of this truth. If w;e fail to do so this or any other Government faces a bleak future for the nation.24. In all this time will not wait for us. Quite soon the seeds of the nextround of wages claims will be planted at the Union conferences. On the otherhand it would be dangerous to rush into public statements and discussions before we have charted the course ahead. I therefore suggest that, if my colleagues agreewith the general line of this paper (i) officials should be instructed to examine the report urgently upon thevarious aspects mentioned in paragraph 22 above;(ii) we should talk over the various possibilities, problems and solutions,which we have in mind, with representatives of the Unions and employers;(iii) in the meantime we should avoid any specific statement about government action on wages policy, although I recognise that the Minister of labour will need to say something on the report of the Court of Inquiry intothe shipbuilding and engineering disputes.P.
