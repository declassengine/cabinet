-    226THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  June 1957SECRET Copy No: 54C. (57) 14012th June, 1957CABINETMANCHESTER&apos;S HOUSING NEEDSMemorandum by the Lord chancellor on 11th April the Cabinet considered a proposal by the Minister of Housingthat the application of the Manchester Corporation to acquire a substantial area ofagricultural land at Lymm in Cheshire for housing purposes should now besubmitted to a public enquiry which in his view should range widely overManchester&apos;s housing needs (C.C. (57) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 3). after discussion I was invited to reconvene the Committee of Ministers, who hadinvestigated the matter earlier, to consider whether the Corporation^ applicationmight appropriately be submitted to a public enquiry; and, if so, what form suchan enquiry might best take. The President of the Board of Trade, the Minister ofAgriculture, the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Housing and I have had further discussions but we have been unable to reach an agreed conclusion and it now seems to us that we should submit for our colleagues&apos; consideration the essentialdifficulty involved.2. Manchester has one of the worst slum problems in the country. the replacement of some 68,000 slum houses is necessary: the city&apos;s total housing need is estimated at 80,000 houses. But whereas Liverpool and Birmingham, which also have serious slum problems, are building new houses at an average rate of 3,000houses a year, Manchester only averages about .1,600 houses a year. The cityauthorities explain the slow rate of progress by pointing to the limitations imposed on them by the lack of suitable available sites, and they believe that if they were assured of sufficient sites for the period 1961-70 they could increase their buildingrate to 3,000 houses a year by about 1961. The initial processes of site developmenttake a long time, and virtually nothing can be done now to improve the positionsubstantially before that date.3. The known available sites for development would enable Manchester tobuild, on what the Minister of Housing regards as a realistic assessment of thepractical possibilities, not more than about 2,000 houses a year from 1961 to 1964with a falling off thereafter. The Minister of Labour and I take a more optimisticview. We are impressed by the fact that there are A\ years to pass until 1961 andthat the urgency of the problem is so strongly felt. On this basis we feel that it isnot unreasonable to expect that the maximum annual figures should be achievednamely:  A. Inside Manchester......      ......      600B.-Hattersley    ......      ......      ...      900C-Hey wood...............      500D. Four small sites    ............      300Total517552,300
We further feel that sufficient sites should be obtained by 1961 from Glossop,Macclesfield and Stalybridge (originally estimated to produce sites in totalnumbering 5,000, 4,500 and 800 respectively) to add at least another 500-600 to thattotal figure of 2,300. We find it difficult not to believe that before the start of the1961 period difficulties obstructing development on some of the potentially availablesites may.disappear or be overcome. Before we came to this view we tried to give full weight not only to the thesis of the Minister of Housing, but also to the supportgiven to it by the President of the Board of Trade. Nevertheless we do not feelthat the additional difficulties deployed by our colleagues justify a public enquiry.4. The Minister of Housing considers that this estimate of possible progress is much too optimistic, for the following reasons. He says that the figure of 2,300above assumes that everything will happen to time, whereas it would be contraryto all the post-war experience of his Department if a programme like this, spreadover a number of different authorities, dependent for essential water and sewerageservices on the co-operation of reluctant minor authorities, and includingredevelopment of slum areas, kept up to time in practice; and he thinks that nothinglike 500-600 a year for four years can be relied on from the possible sites atGlossop (where it is not certain that Manchester tenants can be got to go),Macclesfield (where the borough council are unco-operative), and Stalybridge(which Manchester have rejected on their Medical Officer of Health&apos;s advice).For these reasons his estimate of what will in fact be obtainable is 2,000 sites ayear from all sources. Furthermore he regards it as unrealistic to suppose thatany local authority would think it prudent to work up its building rate from 1,600to something like 3,000 a year (involving engagement of additional staff and so on)if the prospect was that at the end of only four years at the higher rate it wouldvirtually have to stop building. He points out that when the Cabinet decided against Manchester last December (CM. (56) 100th Conclusions, Minute 3) it wason the assumption that in the six years 1961-66 sites would be available for 18,000houses, whereas the correct figure is now 11,000-12,000, because the 18,000included 4,500 at Macclesfield which cannot now be relied on, and also 2,400 onsites within Manchester at present covered by slums which cannot be cleared for building till after 1966.5. The Minister of Agriculture would stress that any estimate of the numberof houses Manchester could build in a period of years starting four years from nowmust, in the nature of things, be speculative; but there is nothing speculative aboutthe fate of the first-class farmland at Lymm if the application of Manchester todevelop it were to be accepted. The Governments decision on the developmentof this land has come to be regarded as the test case of its policy that first-classagricultural land should not be taken for housing or other development if thoseneeds can be reasonably met in other ways. He sees no reason to dissent from themore optimistic view taken by the Minister of Labour and myself; and would suggest that the best way of ensuring that Manchester exploits other possibilitiesto the full is to make it clear to them, without delay, that an application to developLymm would be rejected. He would consider that no convincing arguments havebeen adduced to justify reopening a decision given 2\ years ago after a public localenquiry and reaffirmed by the Cabinet after full and detailed consideration as recently as December last.6. The Manchester Corporation has long been convinced that a rate ofi3,000 houses a year cannot be reached and maintained unless it has under itscomplete control at any rate one large building site, of the dimensions and characterof a new town. The site which the Corporation wishes to acquire (and sinceMobberley is ruled out no other comparable site is known to us to be available)is at Lymm, .12 miles south-west of Manchester. This area is favourably placedindustrially. The site extends over 3,100 acres and would accommodate 12,000houses, together with factories, schools, &amp;c. Unfortunately, and this is the nubof the problem which we must put to our colleagues, the area comprises first-classagricultural land; and if it were developed for housing a considerable area of the surrounding land, of equally good agricultural quality, would inevitably be adversely affected. The Minister of Agriculture thinks that if the Governmentallow this land to be developed by Manchester a most serious blow will be struckat the confidence of the farming community. On the other hand, the Ministerof Housing thinks that the Government would be open to no less damagingcriticism if, after putting slum clearance in the forefront of its programme, it
compelled the Manchester Corporation to limit its re-housing programme by refusing to countenance the development of- the only really large suitable siteavailable.7. Manchester have put their problem before the Minister of Housing (and before his predecessor) and have sought advice. It is now urgently necessary to reply to them. They could be told that it is open to them to make an applicationto the Cheshire County Council, as the planning authority, for permission todevelop any site they think suitable, for this is the formal position. However,this application would certainly need to be referred to the Minister of Housingunder the Town and Country Planning Act and in the end the Government wouldhave to decide, no doubt after a public enquiry, whether to approve the application.A public enquiry, which could be entrusted to an eminent judicial person abovesuspicion of partiality, would have some value in elucidating the facts, which arenow to some extent in dispute. It would go far to allay public anxiety and mightassist the Government to rebut subsequent criticism. But it would not save us from the need, at the end of the day, to take the political decision involved in the choice between town and country interests, and if in the end the Government is going to decide on political grounds that the use of the Lymm site cannot be sanctioned then it would seem unjustifiable to put Manchester and the other interested parties to the trouble and expense of presenting their case to a public enquiry. In those circumstances the only advantage of such a course would beto postpone the day of reckoning. On the other hand, if the Government are notprepared to confirm the decision taken last December that Manchester&apos;s applicationfor Lymm should be rejected, and wish to look at the matter again with an openmind following the holding of a public local enquiry, the Minister of agriculture would see some advantage in that course which would give to the parties concerned the feeling that they had had a full opportunity to make their case, whicheverway the decision might go.8. Sooner or later we are going to have political trouble over this question.If Manchester Corporation is refused permission to build at Lymm we shall be criticised for obstructing slum clearance, and if on the other hand we find forManchester we shall come under fire from the agricultural community. TheCommittee of Ministers has been unable to decide where the balance of advantagelies. In view of the very serious political implications it has seemed necessaryto invite the Cabinet to consider the matter afresh.K.Office of the Lord Chancellor, S.W. 1,12th June, 1956.
