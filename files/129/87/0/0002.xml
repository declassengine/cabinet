(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY lS GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 102 COPY NO.2ZSl April. 1957.warn -Tmhitii , ma urn w, i     itnfcjn --*^-^wibCABINETSjn,PBUIipiNG AND ENGINEERING industries memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service have received the reports of the Courts of Inquiry into the disputes in the shipbuilding and engineering industries.     They will bepublished on Thursday, 2nd May and it will be for the parties to the disputes to consider their attitude and to resume negotiation in the lightof these reports.     The two reports are on similar lines and their main recommendations are:-(i)     An increase on the consolidated time rates for skilled workers of 8s. 6d. (5 per cent)withoutconditions or, alternatively, 11s. a week(6-g- per cent on the stabilisation and productivityconditions which were under consideration when the talks broke down;   the stabilisation condition, whichis the most important one, is that no fresh claim should be put in within twelve months of the date ofagreement (in effect, owing to the procedural delays in negotiation this would probably mean no furtherincree.se for about 18 months).(ii)     The formation of National Joint Councils with regular meetings, and improvement of existing procedure for dealing with disputes.(iii)     The establishment of an authoritative and impartialbody to consider the wider problems of wages policyin all branches of industry, a body with which theTreasury, British Employers&apos; Confederation (B.E.C.),Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) and nationalised industries would be associated.     This is an endorsement of a recommendation of the 1954 Engineering Court of inquiry- Ydiich was never acted upon.2.   I do not know what the views of the parties will be but it seems likely that the trade unions will go for the 6tt per cent conditionalrecommendation, despite some views which they have expressed against acomplete wage freeze.     The employers may also prefer it as the alternativemay be to face a further increase of perhaps 5 per cent early next year,which may mean a greater total expenditure over the whole 18 months;   andthere are also advantages in seeing their way ahead on prices for alinger period.3*   I would not intervene directly in these negotiations unlessinvited or unless they break down again, but we must consider what effect a settlement on either alternative may have on other branches of industry.Apart from engineering and shipbuilding, the big outstanding claims arecoal-mining and docks, railway workshops, Government engineering and shipbuilding establishments, agriculture, building and local governmentworkers.     All of these are keenly awaiting the engineering and shipbuilding
settlements and seme of them (i.e., railway workshops and government establishments) will certainly follow them closely.     It is clear thatthe pattern of at least 5 p&amp;r cent is now set for this wages round.     Itis a real risk that a 6-g- per cent settlement (even vd.th the very valuablecondition of a period of stability) may &quot;trigger off&quot; other claims andthat some unions may try to get this percentage without the conditions.All the same, the value of breaking away from the annual wage cycle seemsto me overwhelming and I would prefer a settlement with conditionseven at 6-g- per cent.    We have, of course, a direct interest in thismatter in its relation to the nationalised industries, particularly inview of the coalmining wage claim,4,   On the second recommendation, I have no doubt that a national council for the major industries is a desirable thing in itself, asbringing together the two sides regularly for discussions on all jointproblems, not merely wages.     It works well in a number of industries and in Government Departments,     The employers in engineering have,however, resisted trade union pressure for such Councils for a numberof years and it would be difficult for me to press them openly about it;I my be able to approach them informally.     There has been no pressure for a Counci-l in the shipbuilding industry,5,   The tlrird major recommendation is one on which Government action is essential, if it is to be implemented.     When this recommendation was made in Lord Morris&apos; 1954- Report, my pi-edecessor put it to theNational Joint Advisory Council$   it was favoured without great enthusiasmby the B.E.C. and most of the nationalised industries, but opposed bythe T.U.C. mainly on the grounds that the work of such a body wouldbe redundant, out of date by the time it was published and might prejudicearbitration.     After further discussion of alternatives the subjectpetered out and has not been revived,6,   We must clearly revive the discussion again and it may now findmore favour,     I think myself that it would have a useful effect on publicopinion to have a body of some independent authority considering thegeneral economic position of the country as affected by wages, profits and prices.     If the T.U.C. maintain their objections, we would have toconsider if it is possible to have an effective enquiry without theircc-oper ati on,7,   I have suggested to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that thereshould be a working parts7&apos; 0? officials from the Treasury, Board of Trade,Central Statistical Office and my Department to work out a definite schemefor the constitution and working of such a body,8.   I should like to have the views of my colleagues on  -(i)     which of the alternatives 5 per cent (unconditional)or 6-g- per cent (conditional) they regard as preferable,having particular regard to the effect on the nationalised industries (paragraph 3);(ii)     the setting up of the independent body referred toin paragraph 5 above,I.M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W.1.26th April, 1957.
