(THIS DOCUMENT TS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 1126th May, 1957DEVELOPMENT AREASMemorandum by the President of the Boa.rd of trade the development areas cover nearly one-fifth of the working population of Great Britain and have remained largely unchanged sincethe Distribution of Industry Act became law in 1945, the main areas(North     Eastern, West Cumberland, South Wales and Scottish centralindustrial belt and Dundee) being enlarged versions of the pre-warspecial areas.2.        The Select Committee on Estimates (Session 1956/57) intheir Reports on the Development Areas and particularly in their third Special Report issued last month, strongly criticised thecontinued inclusion of so large a part of the country and questioned whether the qualification for inclusion &quot;in special danger of unemployment&quot;could reasonably be said to apply over so wide a field and the areasremain unchanged for so long.3.        The Economic Policy Committee, which have considereddevelopment area policy several times recently, agreed on 1st May(E.A.(57) 9th Meeting, It em 2) that while the main structure of existing legislation on distribution of industry should not be amended, the time was appropriate for announcing a major reduction in the development areas.    They accordingly recommended:(i)     that the following areas should be removed from the Schedule:East South Wales,Wrexham,Merseyside,North-Eastern Development Area - thesouthern and western parts,West Cumberland Development Area - outsidethe coal and iron-ore mining areas,South Lanarkshire,North Ayrshire,(ii)     that North West Wales should be added tothe schedule .The Secretary of State for Scotland dissented about North Ayrshire.COPY NO.   0 OaCABINET
4.        If these recommendations are accepted, I would propose toinform the House of Commons next week on the lines of the draft statement attached.5.        Any such changes are bound to fee; politically contentious.But there is substance in the criticisms of the Select Committee and revision of the much out-of-date Schedule will help to restore some flexibility to our development area policy which has tended to lookback to the experience of pre-war years.6.        I invite the Cabinet to approve the proposals in paragraph 3and an announcement on the lines of the draft statement attached.7.        When anixouncing these proposals I should need to add to thestatement a reference to the Government&apos;s intentions on the future ofGovernment-owned factories in the areas to be de-scheduled.    It willbe necessary later to introduce a short amending Bill to enable theBoard of Trade to comply with moral commitments (e. g. extensions to certain of these factories).    The Economic Policy Committee have asked me to submit proposals on this subject for discussion at their meeting on 8th May and I propose therefore to report orally to theCabinet.D.E.Board of Trade, S.W.1.6th May, 1957.
DRAFT STATEMENT ON DEVELOPMENT AREA POLICYUnder the Distribution of Industry Act, 1945, the Board ofTrade acting jointly with the Secretary of State for Scotland where an area in Scotland is concerned, may by Order remove an area from the Schedule of Development Areas when they are satisfiedthat the distribution of industry in that area is such that there is nolonger likely to be a special danger of unemployment.    Similarly,areas may be added when the Board of Trade are satisfied that sucha danger is likely to arise.2,        As stated in their reply to the Select Committee on Estimates(1955/56), who in their reports had advocated revision of the existingSchedule, the Board of Trade have kept a continual watch on thesituation with the intention of making proposals to Parliament whenthey judged the time appropriate.3.        The Government now believe that in the light of current economic circumstances and their assessment of the future, retentionon the Schedule of a number of areas at present included can no longer be justified.    There is now a prima facie case for removing East SouthWales, Wrexham, Merseyside, the Southern and Western parts of theNorth-Eastern Development Areas, the part of the West CumberlandDevelopment Area outside the coal and iron-ore mining areas, NorthAyrshire and South Lanarkshire.4.        The Government would also propose to add North West Wilesto the Schedule.5.        Consultations will accordingly be initiated with the localauthorities concerned, as required under the Act, with a view to thenecessary Orders being submitted later to Parliament.6.        /&quot;Reference to Government-owned factories in de-scheduledareas /.
