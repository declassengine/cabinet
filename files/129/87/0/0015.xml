THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1957SECRET Copy No. 54C. (57) 1159th May, 1957.CABINETEGYPT : BRITISH EVACUEESNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate herewith a report by officials of the Departments concerned onmeans by which payments might be made to British subjects who have lostproperty in Egypt as a result of the Suez military operation. As will be seen fromthe report the problem bristles with difficulties. The report outlines, in paragraphs16-20, a scheme of advances of money against assets in Egypt, but draws attentionto the risk that, if the scheme were adopted, we might find ourselves having to compensate British subjects in full for the losses they have sustained while at thesame time seriously prejudicing any chance of getting anything from Egypt.Nevertheless, political considerations appear to me to rule out the possibility ofa completely negative approach.2. Exploratory talks are in fact about to begin with Egypt about the No. 1Account and related matters. In the course of these talks we shall have a cleareridea of the ultimate intentions of the Egyptians in regard to sequestrated british property. To prejudice the position at this juncture would be unfortunate fromthe point of view of the United Kingdom Government, and it might also be most fortunate from the point of view of the owners of the sequestrated property.3. If Egypt proves to be completely intransigent, there is, with all itsdisadvantages, the possibility that we might seize Egyptian assets in this country,which consist almost entirely of their sterling balances, and distribute the proceedsamong British subjects who have been dispossessed of their property in Egypt.An operation of this kind has in the past been conducted only in respect of enemy property. It would clearly be a last resort and we must recognise that any seizure of sterling balances would deal a blow at confidence in sterling, particularly amongMiddle East countries. We would not wish to suggest to Egypt at present that thiswas in our minds.4. Clearly the first step is to have the talk with Egypt referred to inparagraph 2. In the interval between this talk and any final decisions we may take about resolving our claims on Egypt, there are two alternative courses whichwe might adopt:  (a) We might devise a scheme on the lines of that put forward in the report,by which advances were made against assets in Egypt. This course, asthe report emphasises, presents formidable difficulties. In particular,it changes the basis of our action from the mitigation of hardshipcaused by Egyptian action to the acceptance of liability for claims against the Egyptian Government. This is a course which, as the paperpoints out, we have never followed before.(b) We might continue with our present policies but endeavour to give further substantial easements where hardship or unfairness are still being caused.In this connection, I should mention that we have already paid out sumsin excess of  300,000 to refugees from Egypt through the medium of the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board, and substantial payments will continue to be made. The easements I have in mind that we might
2make would include the acceptance of the scheme (discussed inparagraphs 9-11 of the report) by some of the banks for advances againstassets physically in this country, the taking of action to meet theclaims of the employees of the Suez contractors and, thirdly, are-examination of the scope and scale of payments of the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board.My own preference would be for action to be taken on the lines of (b) above.5.   I ask my colleagues to agree:  (a) That we should not contemplate any radical departure from our present policy regarding seized British property in Egypt until the talks with egypt have made sufficient progress to enable us to judge their ultimateintentions.(b) That if it seems likely that there will be no return of property in theimmediate future, we should consider action on the lines ofparagraph 4 (b) above and should at the same time be considering how we should reach a final solution of the whole problem.P. T.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,8th May, 1957.
SECRETEGYPT : BRITISH EVACUEESReport by officials the ProblemAbout 60 per cent, of the individuals and 50 per cent, of the businesses withproperty in Egypt have now submitted statements to the Foreign Office of their assets. Based on this incomplete material, a rough estimate of the total assets which will be claimed, is as follows: - E. MillionProperty of private individuals  ..       ...      ...      54Property of business concerns    ...      ...      ...      49to which should be added Shell, say      ...      40Total     ...............     143These figures do not include the following:  (i) Debts due to United Kingdom suppliers of goods and services, estimatedat over  2^ millions, many of which arose before the armed interventionand the sequestration of assets.(ii) Goodwill, loss of employment and other non-physical assets.2. The claims of individuals may finally number about 3,000, and those ofbusinesses a little short of 400. The number of individuals includes not only thosewho were resident in Egypt until compelled to leave by recent events these are thegreat majority but also any others in the United Kingdom and elsewhere owningproperty in Egypt. Two-thirds of the numbers claiming hold assets worth less than 5,000. There are forty-four with claims over  100,000 and these claims amount in value to 47 per cent, of the total so far tabulated. Details are given in Annex A.Possibility of Securing Compensation3. The intentions of the Egyptians regarding British property in Egypt arenot known and it is not possible to say what sort of settlement on property it willbe possible to achieve. The Egyptians have so far not replied to our call for thelifting of sequestration and the return of property. Whilst they may agree to therestoration of property and the payment of compensation, it is not possible to saythat they will not seize all or some of the property now under sequestration andrefuse to pay compensation. We have been asked to examine the possibility ofmaking advances against assets, before a settlement with Egypt, to the owners ofthose assets. We should point out at once that, if we do not secure compensation from Egypt, a scheme of advances will inevitably lead sooner or later to heavy pressure on Her Majesty&apos;s Government for full compensation so that the ultimateliability to the Exchequer could be very substantial indeed, possibly  140 millions as stated in paragraph 1 above.What has been done so far4. The Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board has been established for the relief of need, though the interpretation of &quot; need &quot; is generous. Its main job is to look after people in hostels until they can get work, and to pay allowances to those whoare not in hostels, but who have not yet been able to resettle themselves in thiscountry; both forms of support are considerably more generous than those theNational Assistance Board is able to offer to people who are not refugees. Inaddition, it can pay resettlement grants ranging from personal allowances ( 50 foreach adult) up to the major grants (up to  400) for house purchase or theestablishment of an individual in business so far there have only been some fiftycases in which these major grants have been paid. In addition, the Board maymake loans (up to  2,000 or  3,000 in some cases) where they consider that it isthe best chance of resettling somebody in this country.   These loans are not,
however, on the security of assets in Egypt, but on the security of equipment orstock purchased. Payments by the Board include the educational expenses of thosewho incurred commitments in this respect before the Suez emergency.5. The Foreign Office is paying  1 sterling for every  1 Egyptian to thoseBritish subjects who came out of Port Said at the time of the British evacuationand who brought Egyptian notes with them together with a ConsuPs certificateshowing the amount brought out. Approximately  60,000 is already committedunder this arrangement.Gaps in the Present Arrangements6. There is a number of &quot; hard cases &quot; which do not come within the presentscope of the Resettlement Board, for instance those who were not in Egypt whenthe Suez emergency arose but were still dependent on property in Egypt. Butneither would a scheme of advances against assets help this group unless it were extended beyond those who left Egypt for the. United Kingdom as a result ofrecent events. Not more than about half a dozen such &quot; hard cases &quot; have so far been brought to our notice. They could most easily be covered should this bethought necessary by an extension of the activities of the Anglo-egyptian resettlement Board.7. The Board&apos;s grants are intended to enable a person to become absorbed into the economic life of the community, but amongst the refugees are inevitablya number who are too old to find new jobs or to restart their former activities, or who may already more or less have retired. A few of these who are not membersof family groups who can support them may have to rely entirely on weeklyassistance from the Board and ultimately from the National Assistance Board. Ascheme of advances against assets would help some of those in this group,particularly since they are those who would be least likely to wish to return to egypt. But the advances could naturally only help as many as had assets against which to claim.8. Apart from the above cases there are many whom the grants of the resettlement Board, the property they already have in the United Kingdom, oreven their new employment, do not enable them to live in the style to which theyhad been accustomed when in Egypt. They are not suffering hardship, and those whose means prevent them receiving assistance from the Resettlement Board maybe well-to-do. It is this class which a scheme of advances against assets wouldchiefly benefit..The Scheme Prepared by the Banks9. Many refugees from Egypt make a source of complaint of the fact that the assets to which they cannot gain access are already in the United Kingdom. Anumber of London banks have a large number of varied holdings of securities whichthey are holding to the order of banks in Egypt for account of refugees from Egyptwho were customers of the. Egyptian banks. Some of the banks (the largest holderis Barclays, D.C.O.) had branches in Egypt, now sequestrated, to whose ordersecurities are held; others (notably the Midland Bank) hold the securities to theorder of Egyptian banks. In addition to securities, the London banks also holdcash funds (also to the order of their branches in Egypt or Egyptian banks)representing mainly accumulations of income derived from these securities! this situation arises, in the main, from the operation of Egyptian Exchange Controllaw, which required that foreign securities purchased by people resident in egypt and held abroad had to be held to the order of an Egyptian bank on the purchaser^behalf.10. It has been represented to the Chancellor of the Exchequer either thatthe securities should be transferred to the refugees who are the beneficial holdersor that advances should be made to those holders up to a part, at least, of the valueof the securities. The banks which had branches in Egypt Barclays D.C.O. whosubmitted the memorandum, the Ottoman and Ionian banks, and the Londonbranches of the Credit Lyonnais and Comptoir National d&apos;Escompte de Paris-have, indeed submitted a proposal through the Bank of England suggesting that:-(a) Her Majesty&apos;s Government might be prepared, through the Treasury, to guarantee advances made by. banks to such persons, limited to whateveramount Her Majesty&apos;s Government may decide, or :
(b) the bank ask whether alternatively the Treasury would be prepared tofurnish them, possibly in confidence, with a general indemnity whichwould enable them to release these securities and cash to the claimantsin this country without reference to their Egyptian branches concerned.These banks hold 400 individual accounts comprising securities to the value of nearly  1-8 millions. In addition they hold  850,000 belonging to corporateinstitutions (e.g., schools, clubs, churches, &amp;c). The banks have put forward onlytheir second proposal in respect of these corporate holders but they recognise thatthe powers hitherto enjoyed by the representatives of these bodies to deal with their assets in the United Kingdom must be regarded as terminated by sequestration.11. There are overwhelming objections to the latter proposal for the releaseof securities both on legal and political grounds. They are summarised in annex B. The former proposal that for advances: could form the basis of ascheme that would be, at least technically, reasonably satisfactory. There are,however, these points to be borne in mind:  (a) The proposal has only been made by the banks with sequestrated branchesin Egypt. The Midland Bank, which within the limits of exchange control regulations, continues its normal business relations with theNational Bank of Egypt, has been unwilling to associate itself with aproposal which, though less dangerous than the actual transfer of securities might, nevertheless, be considered a breach of the normal practice which should obtain between two banks. Further, whereas the banks who have submitted the proposal know the names of the beneficial holders of the securities (who are customers of their branches),the Midland Bank has nothing more than a series of designatingnumbers, the nominal roll being held by the National Bank of Egypt.In this case the individuals are not customers of the Midland Bank. Itseems doubtful, therefore, whether we could induce the Midland Bankto come into the scheme or whether it could, in fact do so. In additionto the  1-8 millions referred to in paragraph 10 above, only  100,000is held by the Midland Bank; nevertheless, unless the Midland Bankcan be brought into line, a scheme which did not treat all beneficialowners equally might be difficult to justify.(b) In view of the serious objections to any transfer of securities, it must berecognised that neither the banks nor Her Majesty&apos;s Government wouldhave effective cover for the advances from the securities themselves.The idea of &quot; an advance against the securities &quot; is, therefore, something of a fiction; these advances would be little more secured than advancesagainst the value of physical property left in Egypt, the only differencebeing that there is some proof of the assets.(c) The question would naturally arise why we should help one particular classof refugee (i.e., refugees with assets in this country). This seems to usto be the main difficulty with the proposal. But because the securitiesare actually in London there may be particular pressure for action inthis field.A Wider Scheme of Advances Against Assets(i) Lord Killearn&apos;s Proposals12. The British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, which is pressing foradvances, has not made any specific suggestion, except that advances should be confined to individuals and small business concerns. Lord Killearn, in the Houseof Lords on 28th February, made proposals for advances varying from 100 per cent,on property up to  E. 1,000 in value, to 25 per cent, on property over  E.25,000 in value, with no upper limit, which appeared to be confined to private individuals.13. Lord Killearn&apos;s proposal would mean that very large sums would be involved in some cases, unless some upper limit were prescribed; one statement which it is understood will be received shortly from the Smouha family will involve E.16 millions. His proposal for 100 per cent, advances at the lowest end is alsoopen to the objection that values have certainly been exaggerated. It would,moreover, look too much like compensation see paragraph 26.
(ii) An Alternative Scheme14. In general, it should be realised that underlying any scheme of advancesagainst assets there will be very serious implications. These are set out inparagraphs 25 to 28. We should, however, consider here whether any scheme ofa kind similar to that proposed by Lord Killearn would be practicable. We thinkthat it would be safer to confine such a scheme to &quot; refugees &quot; though the cost ofan extension would not be great. We also think that charitable trusts should beincluded, though trustees now in the United Kingdom may have difficulty inproving their right to act on behalf of the trust. We think that commercialcreditors in the United Kingdom fall into a different category, though there would undoubtedly be pressure for their inclusion.(a) Advances Against Certain Physical Assets Only15. It is suggested that advances should be limited to advances against land,buildings, securities including life insurances and share certificates, indemnitiesand cash in the bank. This would exclude furniture, vehicles, jewellery,, cash inhand, in the case of private individuals; these are easily dissipated and offer littlesecurity to Her Majesty&apos;s Government against an advance, whilst their existence and value is almost impossible to establish. It should, however, be pointed outthat the exclusion of furniture, vehicles, jewellery and cash in hand wouldeliminate some claims altogether while leaving others practically intact. Thiswould be true both at the top of the scale of claims and at the bottom, though,broadly speaking, the proportion of excluded items decreases as the claims getlarger. The excluded items represent approximately one-quarter of the statedassets of individuals taken as a group, and about one-third in the case of private business concerns. Over 80 per cent, of the claims of the employees of the SuezBase contractors would be excluded on the basis suggested. Rather different considerations apply, however, in these cases; they are discussed in Annex C.An alternative suggestion is that instead of making advances against certain assetsonly, the advance should be graduated according to the asset. But this might alsoin practice produce wide differences of treatment according to the total value ofthe assets, and would be administratively very difficult. One problem would, ofcourse, be to determine what value should be accepted for securities. Anotherwould be pledged assets since the necessary documents are not available in aconsiderable number of cases.(b) Proposed Scales16. Since the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board is providing assistance tothe poorer refugees, it is mainly those with large fortunes who are concerned, andthey will expect advances to be of some size. It is suggested that an overallmaximum of  10,000 should be fixed.  Intermediate scales might be as follows:  Property  as   defined  above  up  to E.2,000       .........&apos;    ...- E.2,000. to  E.5,000   ... E.5,000 to  E. 10,000 ... E. 10,000 to  E.20,000 ......Over  E.20,000 ............75 per cent.60 per cent, with a minimum of 1,500.40 per cent, with a minimum of 3,000.30 per cent, with a minimum of 4,000.20 per cent, with a minimum of 6,000 and a maximum of 10,000.An alternative might be to make advances to private individuals against assets as defined above to the extent of 30 per cent, with a ceiling of  10,000. This wouldbe simpler, but would benefit those at the top end of the scale at the expense ofthose at the bottom, and so might be difficult to present. For Charitable Trustswe suggest a flat rate of 50 per cent.(c) Business Concerns17. The main assets of the refugees are frequently local businesses, i.e.,private companies or partnerships, and advances should be made against the assets of these concerns, but not in the case of limited liability companies. This wouldexclude the large concerns such as Shell, I.C.I., the banks, the insurance companies,
but perhaps also some locally-registered concerns; the shareholdings of theindividual in the.company would, however, be treated as an asset justifying an advance. An analysis&apos;of the size of private businesses is not available, but theaverage size appears to be about  E.20,000. Advances might be made againstland, buildings, cash in the bank, securities, plant and machinery, the amount involved being added to an individual^ property defined in paragraph 15 above.Advances might also be made against securities held by London banks on behalfof corporate institutions (compare paragraph 10) but the additional legal difficulties arising from sequestration would have to be borne in mind.(d) Repayment18. It would be essential in any scheme of this sort to ensure that any moneypaid out was understood to be advances and not compensation. On this basisinterest ought to be charged. On the other hand there might be political difficultyin charging more than nominal interest. It would in any event be necessary toask for an undertaking to repay upon recovery of property or compensation in lieu, the advance being the first charge on the property. Recovery of advancesmight be difficult even if assets in Egypt were recovered and liquidated sincesterling advances process against individuals abroad would be impossible.(e) Cost19. On the basis of the estimates (which are very approximate and cannotbe guaranteed) the cost of Lord Killearn&apos;s scheme, with no maximum and includingthe private business concerns only (i.e., excluding limited liability companies), mightbe  9^ millions; if a maximum of  10,000 were fixed, it would cost approximately 5^ millions for private individuals. The scheme suggested above might costapproximately  4^ millions to  5 millions for private individuals and CharitableTrusts and million to  1 million for private business concerns, on the assumptionthat the proportion of assets ranking for advances is much the same throughoutthe scale. The cost of the alternative of advancing 30 per cent, would be approximately  4-5 millions for individuals. But if a scheme of advances wereto lead to the assumption of the full liability for compensation, the bill might wellbe in the region of  140 millions.(/) Machinery20. Special machinery would be required to administer a scheme of thiskind, which involves not only the actual payments, but the assessing of statementswhen frequently no documentary evidence is available. The Foreign Office hasneither the machinery nor the expert knowledge to undertake this work. TheBritish Chamber of Commerce has set up its own panels of business men withknowledge of Egypt to assess statements which it receives, and represents the onlybody with that knowledge and experience. On the other hand, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment could hardly hand over responsibility to a non-official body, whilst the Chamber might find itself acting both as judge and advocate on behalf of itsclients. The Foreign Compensation Commission is engaged on paying claims under settlements with enemy countries, and has some experience of assessingclaims. It is suggested that this body should undertake the responsibility. But aconsiderable increase of strength and legislation would be required. Its normaljob is to distribute lump sums received as a straightforward dividend of allestablished claims, including those by limited companies with no upper limit to each claim. The legislation might be controversial. There has as yet been no consultation with the Foreign Compensation Commission.21. Consideration has been given to the possibility of employing the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board on this task, but as constituted it is entirely unfittedto undertake it. It consists primarily of the representatives of a number ofcharitable organisations, selected for their capacity to relieve need and with no experience of the difficult problems of valuation, accountancy, &amp;c, which thequestion of compensation raises. The majority of the people whom the Boardlook after would not be helped by advances against assets, because they have nolarge assets in Egypt. For helping these people an organisation must remain in beingfor the moment, even if a system of making advances against assets is introduced,and its only criterion in treating cases can be that of need. It would be necessaryfor the Resettlement Board and the Foreign Compensation Commission to take into account advances or grants (as the case might be) made by the other whendeciding on its own payments, but there should be ho special difficulty about this.
22. It would be possible for a general scheme to be put into operation inaddition to the limited scheme proposed by the banks and already mentioned. Butit is unlikely that the banks would be willing to make advances against securitiesheld in the United Kingdom if the effect of this were to relieve Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment of a liability (to make low interest loans) accepted in relation to other types of asset. The figure of cost are based on the assumption that the two schemes would be combined into one for which Her Majesty&apos;s Government would beresponsible.23. The need for legislation for the Foreign Compensation Commission hasalready been mentioned. In addition, if the arrangements provided for using the banks, who would be given a guarantee against loss, as well as making directpayments from the Foreign Office Vote, it would be necessary to take SupplementaryVote provision introducing a new subhead for each of these two methods. Theone for the banks would obviously have to be for a token  10 and would, in fact,be the means of seeking Parliamentary authority for this device. The other wouldbe for. the sum likely to be required in the current year. If the timing of theseproposals was such that prior Parliamentary approval could not be obtained beforepayments were made, it would be necessary to bring the proposals to the noticeof Parliament by arranged oral question and answer.24. Any advances made would be treated by Inland Revenue as advancesagainst capital and therefore not subject to income tax or surtax. This treatmentwould be in line with that of current grants made by the Resettlement Board whichare not subject to tax.The Implications of a Scheme of Advances against Assets25. These are the proposals. We think it right, however, to record the seriousimplications underlying them. They would represent an acceptance of liability by her Majesty&apos;s Government for the action of a foreign Government. There are many instances in the past of British assets having been expropriated (e.g., theBaltic States), but no cases of Her Majesty&apos;s Government having accepted liability.If no compensation were forthcoming from Egypt the Government would not onlylose the advances but would probably be forced (sooner or later) into paying fullcompensation for lost British assets to the value of  145 millions. Once theprinciple is conceded there is no defence over a period of time to the argument that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should pay in full. To the extent that compensation is unlikely to be forthcoming from Egypt, there is a very real risk ofthe Exchequer having to find  145 millions.26. The best hope of compensation for those whose assets are in Egypt isstill the return of the assets. But a scheme of advances would be widely regarded ascompensation, and this by itself might adversely affect our negotiating position vis-a-vis Egypt and increase the risk of the full charge ultimately falling on her majesty&apos;s Government. Moreover since a general liability to compensation for theaction of another Government has never been accepted in the past, and presumablywill not be accepted in future cases, advances before a settlement with Egypt wouldhave to be justified on the ground that the losses resulted through the action ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government, and this would be even more damaging; almost certainly fatal, to the chances of getting compensation from Egypt.27. If no restitution or compensation is forthcoming from Egypt as a resultof a general settlement, it would then be for consideration whether Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should take matters into their own hands by confiscating Egypt&apos;ssterling balances, her only considerable assets in the United Kingdom. But suchaction cannot be contemplated for the time being. The general question of the sterling balances is dealt with in Annex D.28. The general scheme which we have described would in practice help alimited range of individuals. Those with assets up.to  1,000 would probably getno more than they have already got from the Resettlement Board. (As indicated inparagraph 21 the Commission will take into account grants made by the Board.)Professional people, the value of whose businesses was mainly goodwill, would not benefit. The bulk of those to benefit would be the relatively rich and in many casesthe very rich.
7 -    103Summary29. Approximately 7,000 British subjects have left Egypt as a result of recent events. Rather fewer than this have come to the United Kingdom. It is expectedthat 3,000 claims will be submitted to the Foreign Office in respect of private individuals&apos; assets in Egypt. One-third of the claims may be expected to be lessthan  1,000 (paragraphs 1 and 2).30. The Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board looks after those refugees whoare without means in the United Kingdom. It is very much more generous torefugees than the National Assistance Board is to United Kingdom residents(paragraph 4).31. In addition to assistance through the Anglo-Egyptian ResettlementBoard. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have undertaken to exchange   for  E.Egyptian money brought out of Port Said by refugees (paragraph 5).32. Very few &quot; hard cases &quot; are not covered by the above arrangements. If itis decided to help them it can most easily be done by an extension of the activitiesof the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board (paragraph 6).33. The pressure for advances against assets in Egypt is thus coming mainly from those who are not suffering hardship. In some cases their funds in the UnitedKingdom may be large (paragraph 8).34. Certain banks have suggested making advances to refugees, with aguarantee from Her Majesty&apos;s Government, against assets which are already in theUnited Kingdom, but held to the order of Egyptian banks. Though there are various technical difficulties, the chief objection is the political one that only those with assets in the United Kingdom would be assisted (paragraphs 9 to 11).35. Lord Killearn in the House of Lords proposed a wider scheme of advancesagainst assets. His proposal was not fully worked out. and certain features of itwould need altering (paragraphs 12 and 13).36. We have worked out an alternative scheme for advances against assets.There are many very serious technical difficulties such as the proof of assets, whenpapers are not available, and their valuation. Nevertheless we consider that sucha scheme could be worked through the Foreign Compensation Commission.Legislation would be needed (paragraphs 14 to 24).37.   The main objections to a general scheme of advances against assets arein the probable consequences:(i) Although the initial cost might be only  5 millions or so, if Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment were forced to accept liability for full compensation,including compensation of commercial interests, the cost might be about 145 millions (paragraph 25).(ii) Because the advances would be regarded as compensation, our negotiating position with Egypt would be damaged (paragraph 26).(iii) The advances would have to be justified on the grounds that individualslost their property through the action of Her Majesty&apos;s Government(Her Majesty&apos;s Government do not take on the liabilities of foreign government) and this might well be fatal to our claims against Egypt(paragraph 26).Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,8th May, 1957.
Annex a value OF BRITISH PROPERTY1. Private Individuals1. Up to 6th May a total of 2,186 returns had been tabulated of a value of E.25,896,878 giving an average of approximately  11,850 per return. Withrequests for forms still being received, it is difficult to say what proportion thiswill represent of the final number and value of returns. In number the indications are that it is probably over 60 per cent.2. Of the 2,186 already tabulated, there are 44 in the over  E. 100,000 class.These 44 total  E. 12,246,487. If these are deducted from the totals above, thegeneral average is reduced to about  6,500. While it is probable that the returnsyet to be received will, in the main fall short of this average, the major items are known but are not yet to hand:   E.The Smouha family       ...      .........      16,000,000The Bianchi family......      ......... 373,489Mr. W. G. MacErven     .......... 146,376The Maurice Benin family       .........       1,081,863and two of three others between  E.50/100,000.3. The following, which can at best be only a rough approximation, mayhowever give some idea of what the eventual total of private returns is likelyto be:   E.Tabulated to date...............      25,896,878Deduct 44 returns totalling       .........      12,246,48313,650,395Calling this 60 per cent, of probable total ofgeneral returns, add 40 per cent.       ......       9,100,26422,750,659Add the 44 returns as above.........      12,246,483Add further large returns to be received as above(say)        ...................      18,000,000Add 206 Chamber of Commerce......... 440,303Add 620 Suez Contractors............ 600,00054,037,445This should, if anything, be a ceiling figure and the final figure may be a million or so pounds less if the average of the 40 per cent, of general returns still to be receivedis appreciably under  E.6,500 as seems probable.4. The analysis of the private claims received up to 6th May, see paragraph 1above, is as follows:  	No. of	Per		Per	Average	cases	cent.

2. Business Concerns5. Around 1,000 sets of forms have been sent out but, in the early stages,sets of business forms were sent out with sets of private forms as it was not alwaysclear which forms the applicants needed. There has obviously been a largeredundancy of business forms as less than 200 returns have been received to date.The tabulation shows that 183 returns total  E.28,432,885 but there are severalbig individual items :  Myddelton   ......Egyptian PhosphateBarclays Bank D.C.O.Cory Bros.   ......Casdagli, EmmanuelJohn Dickinson &amp; Co. E.16,542,7391,348,2361,956,618671,802247,129501,75021,268,274Deducting these six, the general average of the remaining 177 claims is only alittle over  E.4,000. It is probable that, at the worst, 50 per cent, of the businessreturns have been received and, on this conservative basis, the picture of the finalbusiness figure would be something like this:  Tabulated to date.....Deduct 6 returns as above ..Calling this 50 per cent, of general returns, add afurther 50 per cent.............Add 6 returns as aboveAdd further large returns yet to be received  E.

Annex BRELEASE BY UNITED KINGDOM BANKS OF ASSETS HELD TO THEORDER OF BANKS IN EGYPT ON BEHALF OF BENEFICIALOWNERS NOW IN THE UNITED KINGDOMThere are overwhelming objections to any scheme of compensation which involves the release by United Kingdom banks of securities held to the order ofbanks in Egypt on behalf of beneficial owners now in the United Kingdom. Theobjections are both on banking and on political grounds:  (i) It would, as Barclays Bank have been advised by Counsel, lay the banksopen to legal process. Legislation would therefore be necessary, unlessan indemnity were given.(ii) An indemnity from Her Majesty&apos;s Government to cover the liabilities the banks would incur would need to be very wide. It would need to coverdefective or encumbered title, and suit in this country (unless ourlegislation prevented this), Egypt or elsewhere by the Egyptian Bankor Government.(iii) Action on these lines might well (as our former Ambassador advises)provoke the Egyptian Government into turning their sequestrationinto confiscation.(iv) It is doubtful whether any legislation could be restricted to UnitedKingdom residents. The case of, for instance, French holders wouldhave to be considered.These objections are not so serious if it is proposed to make advances againstassets, on the lines suggested in the main body of the paper, rather than to releaseassets which are held to the order of banks in Egypt. As the effect of makingadvances would be the same as the effect of transferring title a scheme for themaking of advances is to be preferred. The scheme which we suggest, however,does not offer to anyone advances to the full value of the securities which are heldon his behalf.Annex CTHE SPECIAL POSITION OF THE CONTRACTORSThe arrangements for the maintenance of the Suez Canal Base under the1954 Agreement with Egypt provided for firms of civilian contractors to act as&quot; caretakers,&quot; their expenditure (plus agreed management fees) being reimbursedby the War Office. There were just over 600 United Kingdom-based employees in the Base, of whom 170 got out in time to avoid internment while the remainder were interned for about 7 weeks. The companies have now paid off all their employees, and their own fees are due to terminate on 31st May, but before thenthey wish to pay compensation in full for (a) loss of funds frozen in Egyptian Banks,and (b) loss of personal possessions. The cost of such compensation is estimated to be about  600,000.2. The Governing Body&apos;s proposals have been endorsed by the Secretary ofState for War in a letter of 14th March to the Chancellor of the Exchequer andhe has reiterated his support in a further letter of 30th April.3. The contractors are pressing strongly for special treatment for their employees on the grounds that:  (i) refusal to pay compensation would be inconsistent with establishedcommercial practice;(ii) most of the employees will have to set up new homes and seekre-employment;(iii) the employees are in a special category because of Her Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s request for them to remain in Egypt when other civilianshad been urged to leave;(iv) failure to pay compensation might prejudice the sponsoring firms&apos; generalindustrial and labour relations.
11107The War Office support these arguments, but the Treasury only regard (iii) asreally substantial. Moreover, payment of compensation to the contractors&apos;employees now would prejudice Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ general policy on compensation claims.4. Nevertheless, the contracting firms represent a powerful section of Britishindustry and they could exert considerable pressure on the Government to agreeto their proposals. Both the War Office and the Treasury agree that paymentof compensation must be subject to proof that claims had been satisfactorilyassessed and that the employees would assign to Her Majesty&apos;s Government anyfurther interest in their claims. It is also the view of Treasury officials that no decision to pay compensation to the contractors&apos; employees should be taken inadvance of a decision on compensation claims generally.Annex the STERLING BALANCES1. The sterling balances are Egypfs largest asset in United Kingdom hands.Egyptian Banks&apos; and No. 2 Accounts amount to approximately  100 millions ofwhich  15 millions has been earmarked for the Sudan. To this may be added about 11 millions representing private accounts in the United Kingdom.2. The balances are held by banks in England, and it would be a breach ofthe banker-customer relationship for them to be confiscated or unilaterally appliedto the liquidation of United Kingdom claims against Egypt. It is true that theEgyptian Government may seem to have absolved us by their behaviour from our obligations to them, but it is vital to our position in the world as bankers thatwe should do nothing to destroy confidence in us or injure our credit. This hasbeen the Government view which was clearly expressed by Lord Gosford in theHouse of Lords on 28th February, 1957.3. Moreover, any unilateral seizure of the Egyptian balances would requirespecial legislation which would be unprecedented in time of peace and might wellprompt the Egyptians to confiscate forthwith assets now sequestrated.
