Printed for the Cabinet. May 1957SECRET Copy No. 5 2C. (57) 1103rd May, 1957CABINETHOUSE OF LORDS reform memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations andLord President of the CouncilSince Lord Salisbury&apos;s resignation I have had discussions with the ministerial committee on House of Lords Reform about the proposals for reform which havebeen before the Cabinet during the last nine months. On 20th December last(CM. (56) 104th Conclusions, Minute 3) the Cabinet considered Lord Salisbury&apos;sproposals for what has become known as the &quot; comprehensive scheme of reform.&quot;Discussion turned on the major issue of policy, i.e., whether legislation for the reform of the House should be introduced in the current Session and, if so, what form it should take. The Cabinet did not then reach a final conclusion, either on the form of legislation or on its timing, but endorsed Lord Salisbury&apos;s proposal that he should take further unofficial soundings among the Government supporters in the House of Lords before initiating a debate in which the merits of the comprehensive scheme of reform could be canvassed.2. At the time of his resignation Lord Salisbury had secured the agreementof the Negotiating Committee of the Independent Unionist Peers to hiscomprehensive scheme, but had not met the main body of the Independent UnionistPeers. While the Negotiating Committee had, I believe, been prepared to acceptthe comprehensive scheme in principle they had made it clear that they were notin a position to bind the main body, and I think Lord Salisbury had reached aposition in which he felt it difficult for him to go on urging his scheme on the Peersunless he were fortified by a definite Cabinet decision in its favour.3. I have myself always been in favour of the comprehensive scheme of reform but I have now regretfully come to the conclusion that in presentcircumstances we should be wiser to propose something less ambitious. I havenever been quite sure that the Conservative back benchers would accept the comprehensive scheme, and I am told that its reception by our supporters in theHouse of Commons is at best uncertain. At the same time I am convinced, as isthe Lord Chancellor, that some reforms are now really necessary for reasons whichare largely practical. There are two dangers which immediately threaten theHouse of Lords. First, the difficulty of getting men, and particularly members ofthe Labour Party, to take hereditary peerages. Second, the problem of gettingPeers to -attend-aYwhat is now a considerable financial sacrifice. If these obstaclesare removed,-the immediate danger to the Lords will be removed too. We should still have the problem of the backwoodsmen, but its is not now of much more thantheoretical importance and it might, if necessary, be dealt with in later legislation.Moreover, there was an undertaking in The Queen&apos;s Speech of November last &quot; toput forward during the present Session proposals for reforming the House ofLords.&quot; This undertaking has aroused considerable public interest.4.   My proposals for reform are as follows:  (a) a Bill to authorise the creation of life Peers, on the lines of Lord Salisbury&apos;s&quot; shorter version &quot;;51558
(b) arrangements (not requiring legislation) to enable Peers to claim up to  4or  5 a day for expenses incurred in connection with attending the...     House;(c) provision by Standing Order for requiring Peers who do not wish to attend  the House to apply for leave of absence.The Life Peers BUI5. Lord Salisbury&apos;s &quot; shorter version&quot; did not impose any limit on thenumber of life Peers, because he thought that a limitation on numbers was onlynecessary and defensible in the context of a limitation on the numbers of hereditary peers.We must consider whether it would be desirable to have some limit, say15, on annual creations, because it could be argued that an unfettered right tocreate life Peers would make it all too easy to swamp the House, with unforeseeablepolitical consequences. For that reason a limitation on numbers might beattractive to our supporters. The Bill introduced by Lord Simon in 1952 proposed a limit of 10 life Peers a year, and under the comprehensive scheme of reformthere was to have been an initial creation of 75 life Peers, arid a limit of 15 a yearthereafter until the final limit of 200 had been reached.There are, however, practical advantages in not limiting the numbers of annual creations. It must always be possible for a Labour Prime Minister to fillGovernment posts in the Lords and he is likely to need life peerages forthe purpose. Moreover, initially the aim should be-to create as large a number of life Peers as is consistent with limiting the appointment to men and women of highcharacter and ability, and therefore, in my view, the freer the Prime Minister^hands are the better. Thus, he might announce that he would welcome suggestions for the conferment of life peerages from the leaders of the opposition Parties. he might also announce that he intended to include some representatives of theChurch of Scotland in his recommendations. (It will be remembered that in discussion on the comprehensive scheme of reform the Cabinet were in favour ofaccording representation to the Church by the creation of life Peers.)On balance, therefore, I suggest no limitation on numbers. We shouldthereby avoid complicating the Bill, which would be a short straightforwardmeasure confined simply to reversing the decision in the Wensleydale case.6. It will be essential, I think, to take power to give life peerages to womenas well as to men. If we do this we may be pressed to allow hereditary Peeressesto sit in the Lords. The Labour Party have hitherto criticised the admission ofPeeresses in their own right on the ground that it would enlarge hereditary rights.I think we could defend excluding Peeresses in their own right on the ground thatthe Bill is concerned only with life peerages. There would be nothing to prevent a life peerage being conferred on a Peeress in her own right. -Power to renounce a Hereditary Peerage7. Considerable public interest has been aroused in favour of the proposition that a man who succeeds to a, hereditary peerage should nevertheless be eligible to sit in the House of Commons, and I have no doubt that there will be a gooddeal of pressure for this reform, particularly in the House of Commons. Aprovision could be included in the Bill (which would have to cover ScottishRepresentative Peers as well as Peers of the United Kingdom) permitting ahereditary Peer to renounce permanently for himself but not for his heirs his rights to sit and vote in the House of Lords by virtue of the peerage which he then holds.A Peer who had renounced would keep his title but could only come up to the lords again in a different peerage, whether life or hereditary. The danger of sucha provision, however, is that it would extend the scope of the Bill beyond the mere/reversal of the Werisleydale decision, by making a fundamental alteration in therights of hereditary Peers. This would, in my view, greatly increase our difficultiesin defending the decision not to embark on a comprehensive reform of the whole system of hereditary legislators. On the other hand we shall almost certainly havetrouble in the Commons if we do not include such a provision. Nevertheless, Ithink that the dangers of enlarging the scope of the Bill (of which I shall say morelater) are more pressing and that we should not include this provision in it.
Exclusion of Peers Leave of Absence9. The Swinton Committee on the Powers of the House in Relation to the attendance of its Members confirmed that a writ of summons cannot be withheld from a Peer, and that by virtue of the writ and his patent of peerage a Peer hasa right to sit and vote in the Lords which could not be denied him withoutlegislative autority. As the law now stands, therefore, the House could not excludea Peer under the guise of granting him leave of absence.10. The Swinton Committee proposed new Standing Orders dealing withleave.of absence. These Orders would declare that it is the duty of all memberseither to attend regularly (or as often as reasonably possible) or to apply for leave /?Of absence. At the beginning of each SessJm^each Peer would be invited to say A /^&quot;W^Wwhether or not he wishes to apply for leave of aosence, and failure to reply wouldbe treated as an application for leave of absence unless the Peer in question takes the oath within a month. Peers to whom leave of absence is granted would beexpected not to attend or sit and vote until their leave of absence was withdrawnon their own application. Although these Orders would not and could not affectthe legal right of any Peer to attend and vote in the House, and could not been forced by any sanction, the Swinton Committee considered that they wouldin practice be effective.11.&quot; As appears above, the Swinton proposals present no real solution to theproblem of. the backwoodsmen for the reason that the absolute right of a. Peerto receive a writ of summons can only be cut down by legislation. Such legislation might for example either:  (a) empower the Crown to withhold a Writ of Summons from a Peer whohad not applied for one; or *(b) enable the House of Lords itself to restrict the attendance of hereditary peers by Standing Order in a manner more radical than that proposedby the Swinton Committee.But I do not recommend that we should undertake any such legislation. TheHouse of Commons would be sure to resent the conferment on the House of lords of the power to alter the constitution by a mere amendment of its own standing orders: and to make a Peer&apos;s right to attend dependent on whether or not he had applied for a writ might have the effect of bringing the backwoodsmen into theHouse rather than driving them out of it. The fact is that any attempt by legislation to restrict the rights of hereditary Peers will inevitably lead us in thedirection of the comprehensive scheme.Payment8. I need not repeat the arguments for doing something to alleviate thefinancial sacrifices which are at present being made by some of the Peers. Iunderstand that when discussing this question on a number of occasions over thelast two or three years with Lord Salisbury successive Treasury Ministers were driven to two conclusions which Lord Salisbury accepted.  These were (a) That the payments must take the form of reimbursement on a claim for expenses and could not be made at a flat rate in respect of attendance: without regard to expenses, since they would, if made in this latter form,become chargeable to tax.(b) That though it would not be necessary for expenses to be vouched by theproduction of hotel bills and the like, each Peer on drawing them would have to make a declaration that he had, in fact, incurred expensesof the amount claimed.I have suggested above a daily limit of  4 to  5 but the precise amount needsfurther consideration and I propose to hold discussions with the Chancellor of theExchequer. The only comment I wish to make at this stage is that in my opinionsome reasonable payment of expenses will be essential to the success of this limited measure of reform, and we must, therefore, be in a position to announce our proposals with regard to payment at the same time that we announce our intentionto introduce the Bill.
12. I think our best course therefore would be not to attempt to deal in theBill with the attendance of the hereditary Peers at all. Any Bill which smacks ofa compromise with the comprehensive scheme of reform is likely to get us the worst of both worlds. I should, however, be prepared to see the Swinton standing orders brought into force as a palliative.Presentation13. The presentation of this limited measure of reform would necessarily have to be somewhat different from that required by the comprehensive scheme.It would be presented and defended as an emergency operation to save the life ofthe House, and the Government, once it had decided to introduce the Bill, wouldhave to be resolute in refusing to accept more ambitious amendments. We shouldhave to say that after much consideration we had come to the conclusion thatthe measures most urgently required for the survival of the House were the powerto confer life peerages on men and women together with some provision for payment, and that these measures were likely to command a wide degree of public support. We might add that the more difficult and controversial questions inherent in a comprehensive reform of the House would continue to be studied. In themeantime, a revision of the Standing Orders of the House on the lines proposedby the Swinton Committee would have our support.Timing14. Lord Salisbury is now in a position to press the comprehensive scheme very strongly from the back benches. I doubt personally whether he wouldbe able to carry the House with him but he would have the support of somepowerful individuals. We are also likely to be confronted with the advocacy ofany number of the countless schemes of reform which have been canvassed in thelast fifty years. For this reason the best course would be to leave the shortestinterval possible between any preliminary debate in the House of Lords and theintroduction of the Bill, but I do not think we shall be able to get through the summer without a motion by Lord Salisbury or Lord Samuel, so I feel we mustbe prepared for a debate late in June. During this debate, I should put forward the Governments proposals on the lines set out in paragraph .13 above. The bill would then be introduced early in the next Session, and during its passage weshould have to put up a determined resistance to all attempts to turn it into a moreambitious measure. Such attempts are less likely in the Commons than in the lords, and for this reason I should prefer to see it introduced in the Commons.Conclusion15. Although I part from Lord Salisbury&apos;s scheme with some reluctance, Ibelieve that these more modest proposals will attract the necessary support in the lords and be accepted by the country as a practical solution to an intractableproblem.  I therefore ask my colleagues to approve:  (1) the above proposals for legislation, i.e., a short Bill simply giving powerto confer life peerages on men and women;(2) the suggestions concerning presentation and timing set out in paragraphs 13and 14 above.H. &apos;Commonwealth Relations Office\ S.W. 1,2nd May, 1957.
