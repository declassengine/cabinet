(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MATEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENTCONFIDENTIALC.(57) 109 COPY NO.2nd May, 1957CABINETNATIONALISED industries memorandum by the Postmaster-GeneralThe discussion started by the Minister of Power&apos;s paper C. (57) 82would be incomplete without some reference to the Post Office, as theoldest nationalised industry and one of the largest.2,      In 1955, agreement was reached with the Treasury that the PostOffice should be responsible for balancing its own budget after makingfull provision for depreciation on a replacement basis, pension liabilityand a payment to the Exchequer in lieu of taxation.    In return, it was to beallowed, among other things, the investment necessary to meet the demandfor telephone service.    All this was embodied in a White Paper(Cmd. 9576).3.     As a result of these commitments, and of rising costs, the PostOffice has, in the past 15 months, increased its charges by an average ofabout one-sixth to raise nearly  50 millions more a year.    the depreciation provision means that the Post Office is providing from incomeabout half its annual investment programme.4.

5.   My colleagues should also fee aware, when considering future price increases in the nationalised sector, that the Post Office expects to be faced with substantial pay settlements in the coming months and thatthese will have to be offset by tariff increases if the Fost Officebudget is to remain balanced.E.M.General Post Office, E.
