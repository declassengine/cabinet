THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT-,-e-Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1957Copy No.CABINETHOUSE OF LORDS reform memorandum by the Minister of Education. . I always had considerable doubts about Lord Salisbury V comprehensive scheme of Lords Reform, although I would have supported if rather than see thesubject dropped, which I consider would be fatal to Bi-cameral Government.However, as between this and the Lord Presidents less ambitious scheme I haveno hesitation in preferring the latter if only on the ground that it has a greaterchance of passing through Parliament.-, 2: The great disadvantage of the Lord Presidents minimal proposals is(i) that they make no modification in the principle of the automatic hereditarysuccession to a Lordship of Parliament notwithstanding that the Lords so long ago as 1910 disclaimed this principle and (ii) that they contain no provision forthe Peer who may, for adequate reasons, wish to stand for or remain in the(Commons..     ^n6n&apos;vm? . &quot;. i&apos;,V .1^.. 7v 3. I should myself be perfectly prepared to stand by the Lord Presidentsproposals if they commend themselves to my colleagues but I am not convincedthat by one or two simple additions they could not be improved so as to cover the two matters 2(i) and 2(h) above. Since the acid test of this Conviction lies inmy ability to embody it in a Bill, I have drafted such a Bill which is appended to this paper.&apos; ry^pae1nj  $ jisi ?.mnt !Tt/?/id j.hW4. The practical effect of this Bill would be largely identical with theLord Presidents proposals, except that it would free heirs and Peers from thedisability from standing for the Commons at the price of a disqualification to sit in the Lords for one (or if it were thought right two) Parliament (which I considerless histrionic than total renunciation).5. In the longer run the composition of the House of Lords would be slowlyaltered as the present hereditary Peers died and their sons were only summoned to succeed if thought fit. This would be a very long process, but in the meantimeit could be combined with &quot;leave of absence procedure&quot; oh the lines of theSwinton Committee&apos;s report or the Lord Presidents paper.6. The position of women is dealt with in my proposals and the system of hereditary titles as distinct from Lordship of Parliament is left untouched.H.Ministry of Education, W. 1,3rd May, 1957.secret (57) 1116th May, 195751571
