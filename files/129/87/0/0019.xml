PRICE STABILITYMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalServiceThe Chancellor of the Exchequer is submitting to the Cabinetthe report of officials (C.(57) 117) on the proposed advisory councilon price stability, in implementation of the recommendation of theCourts of Inquiry into the engineering and ship-building disputes.The report mentions that I am putting in a paper on the way in whichwe might consult the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.), British Employers&apos;Confederation (B.E.C.) and nationalised industries about these proposals.2.      We are, I think, agreed that it is highly desirable that we should secure the co-operation of these bodies, if possible, but that if we areunable to do so, we must nonetheless proceed to set up the Couneil.3.      The original proposals of the 1954 Court of Inquiry, nowreaffirmed by the Jack Reports, were put to the Minister of Labour&apos;national Joint Advisory Council (N.J.A.C.).    They were accepted bythe B.E.C. and to some extent by the nationalised industries butopposed by the T.U.C, on the grounds that all the information that sucha body was likely to elicit was already available to the Trade unions and that its work would affect the impartiality of arbitration courts ,etc;  the objection behind this was, of course, the fear that the body would act in some way in restraint of the free bargaining powers of theUnions.     We shall undoubtedly encounter similar opposition again butI believe its force will be very much blunted by the fact that the council as now proposed will definitely not be limited to wage questions but will be able to deal with profits and dividends.     Moreover, as theTrades Union movement is on record as demanding stabilisation of prices,it would be difficult for the T.U.C, to oppose openly the setting up ofan impartial body to study this question.4.      Ut is possible that the body as now proposed may be less acceptable to the B.E.C. than the somewhat less clearly defined proposalput to them three years ago, but I do not think that they will carryopposition very far;   indeed, some opposition to the proposal from theemployers1 side may assist its acceptance by the T.U.C.5.     As to the nationalised industries, I do not expect any particular difficulty, especially if the B.E.C. and T.U.C. are at least preparedto acquiesce.6.      In all the circumstances, I do not think that I should put theseproposals, as on the previous occasion, to my N.J.A.C. at least atany early stage.COPY NO./(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 1199th May, 1957CABINET
7.      I suggest that our consultations should be in two stages -first, informal discussions between officials and the three bodiesseparately in which it could be made clear that while the government intend to proceed broadly on the lines suggested by the Courts,firm decisions on details have not been reached.    This will give some room for negotiation and manoeuvre.    When that stage hasbeen concluded, either in agreement or in a definition of the areaof disagreement, I suggest that final proposals should be put formally to the three parties by the Prime Minister.    The question whetherthis should be done at a joint meeting or separately would be betterleft until we see the results of the informal talks.I.M.St. James&apos;s Square, S.W.1.8th May, 1957.
