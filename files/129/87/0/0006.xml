THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 10630th April, 1957CABINETTHE EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL FREE TRADE AREANote by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Treaty of Rome establishing the European Customs Union has now been signed and the ratification processes are about to start in France and Germany.In these two countries they are expected to be completed towards the end of July.Meanwhile, the negotiations for the Free Trade Area are proceeding very slowly.There is every sign that the six signatories of the Rome Treaty France, Italy,Western Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg are not in theleast anxious that these negotiations should proceed at all rapidly, and the french in particular would prefer little or nothing to be done until their own ratificationprocesses are complete.2. This exposes the United Kingdom to a most dangerous situation. If theCustoms Union comes into existence and there is no Free Trade Area, this will represent a very grave economic threat to the United Kingdom. Yet, once theCustoms Union Treaty has come into effect, it will become increasingly difficult for us to be sure of attaining the Industrial Free Trade Area which we need tosafeguard our interests.3. There is no satisfactory or complete answer to the difficulty in which weare now placed. I attach a report by officials recommending a course of action for the next two months.P. T.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,30th April, 1957.
THE CUSTOMS UNION AND THE FREE TRADE AREANext StepsReport by OfficialsWe have made a detailed analysis of the likely effects of the Treaty of Romeestablishing the European Economic Community on the United Kingdom.Broadly, our conclusions are that if no free trade area can be established onsatisfactory terms, at least with the European Economic Community, the gradualemergence of that Community will represent a most serious threat to UnitedKingdom interests. We are likely to lose progressively in extremely valuablemarkets in Europe, particularly in the low countries; if, as seems likely, theCommunity were extended ultimately to cover other European countries, Denmarkat first, then Norway, perhaps in the end Sweden, the loss will be even greater.The damage will not be limited to visible trade. The provision of British services to Europe is likely to be affected. Moreover, the creation of a bloc seeking to operate together in economic and financial matters is likely to damage the positionof the United Kingdom in these fields. On the other hand, if we are to secure a free trade area on satisfactory terms, the dangers for us which arise out of theexistence of the Community will be substantially parried.2. The confirmation of the analysis made in 1956 makes it more than evernecessary to press forward the negotiations for the free trade area.3. But we have been formally warned by the French Government that it willnot be possible for them to bring negotiations for the free trade area to a conclusivepoint until the ratification in the French Parliament is completed, which may notbe before 15th July in the Assembly and rather later in the Council of the Republic:This is partly because neither they, nor indeed any of their partners in the &quot; Six &quot; France, Italy, Western Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg-have yet been able to give real consideration to the problems of the free trade area.But more important is the belief of the French Government that, if any document which looks like a draft Convention for the free trade area is in circulation whilethe ratification process is proceeding, members of the Assembly will be able to claim that the Government is committing itself to another Treaty which gives fewersafeguards to France than those in the Treaty of Rome. They believe that thiswill endanger ratification. They believe the additional votes that association withthe United Kingdom would bring in would be less than those that would be lostif such doubts about safeguards crept in.4. The behaviour of the delegates of the other signatories of the Treaty of rome suggests that they will support the French. Indeed, all the evidence suggeststhat there is at present little political interest among the Six in the free trade area as such. We cannot therefore count on the negotiations in the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) giving us any reasonable assurance that basic decisions can be taken in July to establish a free trade area. Nor can we have any real confidence, as things now are, that a free trade area will bebrought into being.5. We have therefore re-examined the considerations that have hitherto ledus to believe that early decisions on the free trade area were desirable. they appear to be the following:  (a) It is industrially desirable that the Customs Union and the free trade areabegin to take effect together. (The French have assured us, however,that in any case the Treaty of Rome will not enter into force until 1st January, 1958, and the first tariff reductions will not be before 1st January, 1959.)(b) It will be disturbing politically and industrially for there to be any long delay between the ratification of the Rome Treaty and the signature of the Free Trade Area Convention.(c) If there is to be no free trade area, the Rome Treaty will be a grave threatfor us. It would therefore be dangerous for the ratification of theTreaty of Rome to be completed by all the signatories before Her
Majest&apos;y&apos;s Government is able to judge whether there will be a free trade area, both because we should have missed the opportunity of influencing the ratification thus weakening our bargaining position and because it will be difficult to know what attitude to take publicly, at home andabroad, to this new situation.6. On the other hand, there is a great deal to be said for taking the free trade area negotiations at a rather slower pace than we have hitherto had in mind:  (a) The subject matter is complex and difficult.   It is not reasonable to askcountries to take decisions precipitately. Very few countries have done so much preparation as we, yet we are still running into unexpecteddifficulties.(b) It is probable that once the French ratification is complete we can expectrather more support from the other signatories of the Rome Treaty,particularly Benelux and Germany, in obtaining the sort of free trade area we want.(c) Some sections of industry in the United Kingdom are feeling that they arebeing rushed, and would probably welcome a slower pace if this didnot prejudice the chances of getting the free trade area.7. We have throughout maintained that without a free trade area the customs union would be dangerous, a source of division within Europe. It is surelyinevitable that, in a situation in which our traders are being progressively squeezedout by discriminatory trading arrangements, co-operation between the UnitedKingdom and Continental Western Europe, political and military as well aseconomic, would be gravely affected. The whole of our overseas policies wouldhave to be re-examined.8. It is doubtful whether the Six have appreciated the far-reaching effects oftheir policies, and it should be our first task to bring home to them the dangers.They should be reminded of the importance of the United Kingdom market to theirexporters and of the pressures there would be on Her Majesty&apos;s Government insuch circumstances to adopt a less liberal import policy towards them.9. There can be little doubt that if the United Kingdom were to declare itshostility to the Customs Union and indicate that if it came into being we shouldreact against it by all the means at our disposal, this could have a powerful effect onthe various Parliaments and might well hinder the ratification. But we do not want to use such language, or even contemplate such action, unless we are sure we cannot get a free trade area.10. What we need is that all the Governments of the Six should understandclearly that it is this wide concept of European unity that we have in mind when wesay that the Customs Union without the free trade area will divide not strengthenWestern Europe, and that this is the danger they run if they do not bend their efforts to creating the free trade area. We want them to become politically committed toa free trade area on the broad lines which the United Kingdom has proposed beforethe ratification process is complete and to demonstrate by their behaviour in negotiations that they are in earnest. Obviously, we should still be at some riskeven with such commitments, but we should be far better off than we are now.Proposed United Kingdom Objectives11.   In detail our objectives should be: -(1) To press on with negotiations within the O.E.E.C. for the free trade area so that through the settlement of specific points a climate of opinion is- created which accepts the free trade area as both desirable and probable.(2) To obtain from the Six agreement that they will give public support for an industrial free trade area, broadly on the lines proposed by the UnitedKingdom, during their ratification debates.(3) As a necessary condition of (2), to agree on the broad framework withinwhich agriculture shall be handled.12. The Colonial problem arising from the association of overseas territorieswith the Customs Union and the necessity to seek mitigation of the damage toBritish Colonies, will arise whether or not there is a free trade area. A separate report on this is being submitted to Ministers.
13. It is clear that, because of the unwillingness of the French to see any document which looks like a draft Convention for the free trade area in circulationuntil the ratification process is over, we cannot use the O.E.E.C. Ministerial meeting in July to obtain our major objective, the political commitment of the Six to an industrial free trade area. We must therefore, without halting or slackening our efforts within O.E.E.C., use alternative approaches. In order to obtain our objectives, as set out in paragraph 11 above, action on four fronts will benecessary:  (a) Political.ib) O.E.E.C.(c) Agriculture.id) The special problems of France.Political Action14. During the month of May we must bring home to all the Six that ifthe Customs Union is not accompanied by a free trade area there will be a grave danger of political, military and economic division within Europe. It is essentialto create in the Governments of the Six the same political will to bring about thefree trade area as has been apparent in respect of the Customs Union during thelast six months of negotiations in Brussels. Without this will the Paris negotiationswill remain unreal. It will also be necessary to point out to the Six the grave difficulties which will face Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom if,while the ratification process moves on, Her Majesty&apos;s Government is not able tosay that the Paris negotiations are progressing satisfactorily, and if the Governmentsof the Six do not appear publicly to be anxious for a successful outcome; all the dangers of a European division inherent in the present situation will be brought out into the open and quite incalculable political damage may be done.15. All this we suggest can only be done by Ministers. We suggest action onthe following lines:  (a) The Prime Minister should speak to the Federal German Chancellor onthe lines of paragraph 14, at Bonn on 7th May and tell Dr. Adenauerthat we are speaking in similar terms to the French. If grave damage is not to be done, it appears to us essential that the French, and indeedall the Six, show greater willingness to negotiate within O.E.E.C. than has been hitherto apparent.(b) The Chancellor should ask the French Minister primarily responsible, M.Maurice Faure, to come to London, speak to him also on the lines ofparagraph 14 and urge on him the need for speedy negotiation andpublic support by the French Government for the free trade area.(c) Ministers, in public speeches on European policy or economic policy generally, should emphasise the importance of a free trade area if theCustoms Union is not to create serious economic and political disunitywithin Europe.(d) Italy, Belgium and Holland; action here should be considered further inthe light of the German and French discussions.O.E.E.C.16. There is now little prospect of the Chancellor being able to present tothe July Meeting of the O.E.E.C. council a report on the basis of whichfundamental decisions can be taken by the Council. However, it would be whollydisadvantageous for the tempo of negotiation in O.E.E.C. to be slowed down; onthe contrary, it needs to be speeded up. But some modification of the time-tableis necessary. It would be better to have a Council Meeting in early October whenreal decisions could be taken than an abortive meeting in July. In discussions with the French we should indicate our readiness to postpone the Council meeting to meet the French difficulties about publicity, provided they for their part areprepared to agree that the substantive negotiations in O.E.E.C. should move forward now;
Agriculture17. It has become clear that it is quite impossible to obtain an industrial,free trade area unless some means is found of dealing with agriculture at the same:time within O.E.E.C.   The principal problems are these:  .(a) How to meet the wishes of OE.E.C. members, and in particular the Six,to make some arrangements for agriculture in parallel with theindustrial free trade area.(b) How to meet the special problems of Denmark which are posed by theCustoms Union.(c) How these two things can be achieved consistently with the UnitedKingdom position and without jeopardising Commonwealth \goodwilltowards the industrial free trade area.The first step is to make clear at home and abroad what our position on agriculture is. This is in hand. But the exclusion of agriculture from the free trade area willnot be accepted by the Six, or the other members of O.E.E.C., unless we give them an earnest of our willingness to go to the limit allowed by the special positionof the Commonwealth in our markets in co-operating with them in agriculturalmatters. Urgent consideration is therefore being given to what might be done inthe light of our domestic policies. This will involve carrying the Commonwealthwith us.18. A factor to be taken into account in deciding what can be done to reconcile the Six and other O.E.E.C. countries to our position is that commonwealth countries are concerned not only to preserve their markets in continental Europe but to expand them. If they find that this is impossible, giventhe arrangements of the Six, they may well exert embarrassing pressure on us toaccept greater quantities of their products.19. The Danish position presents great difficulties. She justly fears that theTreaty of Rome will mean discrimination against her agricultural exports by the six and above all the loss of her vital market in Germany. She is also disturbed at the political difficulty of having to remove in the free trade area the protectionshe accords to her industry without corresponding benefits for her agriculture inother countries. The Danes have been discussing with the Six ways and meansof association with the agricultural arrangements in the Treaty of Rome. Howsuch an association might be brought about falls to be considered as part of the study, mentioned above, of what might be done to meet the Six without endangering our basic position on agriculture or frustrating the establishment ofa free trade area for industrial goods.France20.   Of the French points on the industrial free trade area known to us, thefollowing appear to us to be the most difficult:  (a) The Proposal for Harmonisation of Tariffs in Order to Prevent diversion of trade the French maintain, with some reason, that if there are different externaltariffs, particularly on raw materials and semi-finished goods, this will tend togive advantage to the country with the lowest tariff. They therefore want some&quot;harmonisation &quot; of external tariffs. We cannot possibly agree to proposalswhich would involve us in raising our tariffs or putting a tariff on commonwealth goods. Not only is it right that the pressures of a free trade area should operate in such a way as to bring down the tariffs, vis-a-vis third countries, and thus prevent the area from being an inward-looking bloc; itoincrease our tariffs for this purpose is a complete impossibility for the UnitedKingdom since this would mean either abolishing Commonwealth free entry for the products in question or increasing the margin -of preference.(b) Harmonisation of Social Legislation (Primarily on W.ages and Hours ofWork)In principle this is a complete impossibility for ms. without a fundamental change in the attitude of Government in the United Kingdom to wagenegotiation. In practice we can probably devise formulae and [procedures which would satisfy any Teal apprehensions the French may feel. All depends on whether the French will insist on treating it as a matter of principle-or -of practice.
(c) The Time-Table for the Abolition of TariffsThe procedures in the Rome Treaties for the gradual abolition of tariffsare in our view capable of improvement in several respects; but above all itleaves doubts as to whether it will still move forward after the first fouryears. We need to be sure that the process of tariff reduction, once started,will proceed forward inexorably. If we can secure this, the danger of becomingstuck half way is largely avoided; if we cannot, the very imprecision of theformula in the Rome Treaty will provide a valuable weapon for attack againstthe Customs Union in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.21. There are other points on which we should like to obtain more satisfactoryprovisions in the free trade area. These are contained in the Treaty of Rome,particularly on the special French escape clauses providing for the continuationunder certain conditions of the present French import taxes and export subsidies.But in fact the Treaty, though not as satisfactory as we might have hoped, is agood deal more precise than anything France has been persuaded to accept in anyother field of international co-operation. In certain circumstances, not in themselves inherently unreasonable, it provides for the abolition of these special measures without any possibility of a French veto. The one right we must have,which is not given to France&apos;s partners by the Treaty of Rome, is to levycountervailing duties against French goods which have received export subsidies.22. The examination of these questions can, if Ministers agree, be pressed forward in the Anglo/French Economic Committee in the first place. But for this to be effective the Ministerial action referred to in paragraph 15 will be an essential preliminary.Conclusions23.   We accordingly recommend:  (a) That Ministers should endorse the objectives set out in paragraph 11.(b) That Ministers should agree to the action on four fronts political, withinO.E.E.C., on agriculture, and in relation to France, as set out in detail in paragraphs 14-22.30th April, 1957.
