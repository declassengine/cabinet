Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1957SECRET Copy No. 51C. (57) 1501st July, 1957CABINETTOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (MINERALS) REGULATIONS, 1954Memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and theMinister for Welsh affairs on 4th June the Legislation Committee considered my proposal that I shouldmake Regulations amending Regulation 10 of the Town and Country Planning(Minerals) Regulations, 1954 (L.C. (57) 12th Meeting, Item 2). The amendingRegulations would have to be laid before Parliament as soon as they were made,and would require affirmative resolutions.2. The Committee agreed that the balance of advantage lay in making the amending Regulations forthwith, but thought that in view of the political difficultiesI should bring the matter to the notice of the Prime Minister. The Prime minister has asked that I should circulate a paper to the Cabinet.3. The amendment is intended to cure a defect in the present regulations which has come to light during my consideration of an individual applicationfor permission to extend a limestone quarry at Berry Head, Brixham, Devon.This application is still before me. An alteration of the Regulations now would affect the amount of compensation payable if that application were refused as Iam sure it should be. There are obvious objections to altering the law in such circumstances, but there are also cogent reasons for doing so in the present instance.4. The application in question is from the Berry Head Quarry Company.The workings of this firm are of long standing, but have so far been confined tothe edge of the headland. In 1949 they applied for an extension, to include much the same area as that now under consideration. The then Minister of Town and country Planning granted them a limited area, near to the edge of the headland.This was enough to keep them going for about fourteen years. But the Ministerfurther said that in his opinion no working beyond this should be permitted at thiswell-known beauty spot.5. In 1954 the firm went back to the Devon County Council with a proposalto work much the same area of land as was refused in 1949. The County Council,after taking CounseFs opinion, were alarmed at the possible size of the bill for compensation if the application were refused, and despite the strong objectionson amenity grounds, were disposed to grant it. In view of protests from the localM.P.s, Brixham Urban District Council and others, the application was eventuallycalled in by my predecessor and (after a delay asked for by the applicants) therewas a public local inquiry.6. The inquiry confirms that there are very strong amenity objections to allowing the application.  But the difficulty about compensation remains.7. The difficulty is as follows. Sub-paragraph (1) of Regulation 10 of the minerals Regulations came into force in 1948, following the passing of the Townand Country Planning Act, 1947. Under it, any mineral operator who has been working land since 1937 under pre-1947 Act arrangements, and is refusedpermission under 1947 Act powers when he asks to be allowed to continue workover contiguous land, can claim compensation for abortive expenditure or loss byway of depreciation of value or otherwise in respect of buildings, plant ormachinery. In this case the Company has already had one extension permitted under the 1947 Act, and there will be no valid claim for compensation under sub-paragraph (1) if permission for a second extension is refused.   In January51829
1955, Regulation 10 (2) was added. Its intention was to allow anyone who had established a claim under sub-paragraph (1) to claim, in addition, compensation forother loss or damage directly attributable to the refusal of permission, such as lossof profits. Owing to a drafting defect, however, the Regulations do not carry out-this intention. Sub-paragraph (2) is not properly linked to sub-paragraph (1), andita claim under it could be established even though a claim under sub-paragraph (1)would fail. The Law Officers advise that while in the case of the Berry HeadCompany a claim under sub-paragraph (1) could not be successfully established bythe Company, they might well, thanks to this drafting defect, establish a claim under sub-paragraph (2).8. The firm&apos;s output is substantial, and much of it goes to meet big long-term contracts. The Valuation Office think that a claim for loss of profits, &amp;c, under regulation 10 (2) might be established for as much as  200,000. Of this, halfwould fall to be paid by Devon County Council, and half by the Exchequer.9. The matter of course goes much wider than this particular case. Anyother mineral undertaker who has been or may be refused permission under the1947 Act to extend his workings in similar circumstances could establish a claim under Regulation 10 (2), so long as the wording remains as at present. Theloophole must therefore be closed as soon as possible. To make the necessaryamending Regulations before the Berry Head application to develop is decided is liable to be criticised on the grounds that it would affect the compensation payable in this particular case if the application were refused, and that it is wrong to change the rules in the middle of the game; but nevertheless, after very carefulconsideration, I think that this is the right course, for the reasons set out below.The Legislation Committee, after full discussion, supported me in this view.10. The reasons are that the firm have no claim in equity to thiscompensation, since it was made absolutely plain to them in 1949 that this land should not be worked; and they were then clearly warned that they must reconcilethemselves to winding up their operations on this site after a few more years&apos;working. Furthermore, at the time when they made their application in 1954,Regulation 10 (2) did not exist and could not have been foreseen by them: so they could not now claim that they were being denied rights which were there whenthey made their application.11. All the possible alternatives seem to me to be open to even more serious objection than the course I propose; and the Legislation Committee, after considering them, came to the same conclusion. I have not the slightest doubtthat it would be wrong, on merits, to grant the application to develop. If I did,there would be a public outcry, and a justified one. It would spoil this particularheadland, which is very popular with holidaymakers; and there is no reason to suppose that limestone of a similar quality could not be obtained elsewhere. Thealternative of refusing permission, and simply paying compensation, seems to meto be equally objectionable. It would, in effect, mean paying the company a largesum of public money merely because they ignored the earlier warning that theywere to wind up their operations; and I do not see how it would be possible in thecircumstances to justify putting this large financial obligation on the Devonratepayers, particularly when the County Council themselves wanted to givepermission, mainly because they were frightened about the size of the bill for compensation.12. I seek the assent of the Cabinet therefore that I should go ahead and make the amending Regulations at an early date. The Secretary of State forScotland wishes to take parallel action.13. I have it in mind to notify the Federation of British Industries and otheroutside interests (but not the individual Company) when the Regulations are laid.I should not consult them first, since the modifications have the sole object of meeting the original intention, of which they are aware.14. I hope that my colleagues will agree that the criticism which may be expressed must be accepted, and that it would be right for me to proceed in theway I have indicated. We shall in my view incur still more damaging criticism if we adopt anv alternative course.H. B.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,1st July, 1957.
