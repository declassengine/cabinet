2134AnnexRECOMMENDATION No. 101 CONCERNING VOCATIONAL TRAININGIN AGRICULTUREThis Recommendation sets out the main guiding principles to be taken intoaccount in authorising and developing adequate systems of vocational training inagriculture. The objectives, scope and methods of such training are described in detail, particular mention being made of pre-vocational training, agriculturalinstruction in secondary schools, agricultural technical schools, training on the farm, apprenticeship, seasonal and evening courses, training for teachers and ruralleaders, and the provision of suitable teaching aids and materials. The need is emphasised for co-ordinating the different types of training programmes and for maintaining close collaboration with employers and workers in agriculture andwith other interested organisations. International exchanges of visits amongworkers in different branches of agriculture and the promotion of internationalcentres for research and training are advocated.The law and practice of the United Kingdom are generally in conformity withthe provisions of this Recommendation apart from the following two exceptions:&apos; (1) Paragraph 10(1) of the Recommendation provides that where noagricultural teaching is given in rural secondary schools provision should be made for the gradual introduction of such instruction in thecurriculum. In the United Kingdom the Government does notprescribe what schools should, or should not, include in their curricula,and it is not proposed to change this practice.(2) Paragraph 23 (2) of the Recommendation lays down, inter alia, that hoursof work of apprentices should be determined by legislation, by regulations issued by the competent authority, by arbitral award orcollective agreement, or by the decision of special bodies entrusted withthe task. In this country, the hours worked by apprentices are not determined by any of those methods, but are a matter for mutual agreement between the parties concerned. It is not proposed to take any action on this matter.Subject to reservation on these two matters, it is proposed that thisRecommendation should be accepted.
