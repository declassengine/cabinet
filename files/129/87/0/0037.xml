(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 137 COPY NO5th June, 1957CABINETTHE ROADS programme memorandum by the Minister of transport and Civil AviationThere are votes in roads.The more traffic increases and thus the more the completeinadequacy of our present road system is disclosed, the more this statement will become painfully apparent.    No doubt my predecessorshad all this in mind when they brought forward their road programmes.As far back as 1954 it was the view of the then Minister of Transportthat a  60 millions payments ceiling on the road programme was essential even without any motor roads.    In the end this programme was cut to  40 millions and some motor roads were put in.    It thusbecame quite inadequate.    Our present ceiling of expenditure withoutScotland  (which is not now my responsibility) is about  35 millions.2, I have therefore been discussing with the Chancellor of theExchequer the size of the Governmenfs next four year road programmeafter the present programme comes to an end in 1958/59.    TheChancellor has offered me a payment ceiling on this new programmeof  50 millions a year.    This may seem a generous increase, but Iam afraid I must say that it is inadequate if we are to show anything like satisfactory progress in road building at the end of this Governmentsterm of office.3. The programme which I put forward to the Chancellor of theExchequer on October 15th, 1956, would involve an increase to a ceiling of  60 millions a year.    The least that has been demanded bythe many critics of the Governmenfs road programme is  75 millions a year.    I should therefore on technical points have asked for more,and the engineering resources of the country could certainly cope witha larger programme.    However, knowing the very heavy demands onour capital investment programme I kept the target as low as I daredand I cannot see how anything less than a  60 millions programme canbe justified as being either economically sound or politically defensible.4. The increase on the present programme which would be afforded by the  50 millions ceiling which the Chancellor has offeredturns out to be largely illusory when account is taken of increases inthe estimated cost of a number of schemes in the programme, of the
\need for me to honour the undertakings given by my predecessors, and ofthe result of bringing forward certain major schemes.    The purpose ofthese major schemes is to make a real start on the motor roads programme so often promised by successive Ministers of Transport andmore important to show some progress on these roads during the life-time of the present Parliament.5. The five major projects which I have announced as meriting thehighest priority and to which I am fully committed are:-The London-Birmingham and Birmingham-Preston motor road;the completion of the bringing up to modern standards of the Great NorthRoad; the Medway Towns motor road to the Channel ports; the birmingham-Bristol motor road;  and as much of the South Wales RadialRoad as we can afford.    The last will include the eastern end fromChiswick to Slough, including the Slough By-pass, but I have already offered to postpone the western end including the Severn Bridge for themoment to try to meet the Chancellor.    In addition to these five schemeswe shall have to find room at an early date for the Tyne Tunnel and theduplication of the Blackwall Tnnnel, both very necessary projects foraccelerating industrial transport.6. These major projects take up a large proportion of the total amount of money available under any programme, but under a  60 millionsprogramme there womld still be enough left over to enable the rate ofauthorisations on other schemes to be kept up to a level of  30 millions a year.    (In the current year 1957/58, the figure is  38.3 millions.)If the payments ceiling were limited to  50 millions, the value of smallerschemes which could be authorised would drop to  33 millions in 1958/59and to only  16.9 millions in 1959/60.    This would mean that outside the major projects there would be a progressive and rapid reduction ih thescale of effort throughout the country on road improvements just at thetime when the highway authorities would be geared up to the maximum.The total authorisations on the whole programme would go up from thepresent  62 millions in 1957/58 to  77.1 millions in 1958/59 but woulddrop disastrously to  48.7 millions in 1959/60.    Under the  60 millionsceiling, however, we should be able to go up to  82.1 millions ofauthorisations in 1958/59 and only drop to  68.7 millions in 1959/60.This seems to me to be the least the Government can afford for political reasons.7. I do not wish to appear in any way ungrateful to the Chancellor.I know he has the rest of the capital programme to consider.    i think hewill agree that I too have tried to be helpful and I have not in the past18 months pressed this matter as much as I should from the roads aspectbecause of the other problems that he and his predecessor have had to face.    We have now come to the point of decision and unless I canauthorise at once a sufficient volume of work we shall be faced, before theend of this present Parliament, with a startling drop in authorisations,other than the five major projects, and in a confession that the road programme generally, far from accelerating, is being cut to a majorextent.    This is not something that can be put right at that time.    it takes at least two years for a major road project to advance from adecision to authorise it to the time when the work goes out to contract.
I feel that it is my duty to my colleagues to try to advise them on the size of the programme that will at least fulfil the pledges given by mypredecessors and will enable us to claim sbme progress on building asystem of motorways.8. 1 must make it plain that I do not put forward the  60 millionsprogramme as one that will earn us great praise, but merely as theirreducible minimum that I honestly feel I can defend.    Very little ofthis additional expenditure will fall in the lifetime of the present parliament, but for the reasons I have mentioned above the work mustbe started and started now if we are to maintain the momentum of theroads programme.9. To sum up then, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has offeredme a ceiling of  50 millions a year for the four years from 1959to1963.    Having taken the best technical advice and thought the matter over myself with great care, I feel that the least I could honestly defendis a ceiling of  60 millions a year over the same period.H.W.Ministry of Transport and CivilAviation, W. 1.4th June, 1957.
