(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 117 COPY NO.9th May, 1957.CABINETWAGES AND prices note by the Chancellor of the exchequer was invited by the Cabinet on 30th April to arrangefor officials to examine the problems involved in establishing an advisory Body on wages and related matters, as recommendedby the Courts of Enquiry into the ship building and engineeringdisputes (C.C.(57) 36th Conclusions, Minute 4).     I circulate areport by officials on this matter.F.T.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.8th May, 1957.
SECRETWAGES AND PRICESREFORT BY officials the Government have announced that they welcome therecommendation of the Courts of Inquiry into the recent ship-building and engineering disputes that an &quot;authoritative and impartial body&quot; shouldbe set up to examine the wider problems of wages policy in aninflationary setting.    The Cabinet on 30th April directed that officials should examine the problems involved in establishing an advisory bodyof this kind.Term and Method of Appointment2. The wages-prices problem is very stubborn and the impact of the proposed body upon it could be assessed only after the experienceof several years.    While, therefore, the body might be described asexperimental, it should be made clear that the Government contemplate that it would operate for a period of three or four years at least.Appointments might be made for three or four years in the first instance.Legislation would no doubt be required ultimately if it were decided tomake the body permanent, but need not be proposed at the outset:  the appropriation Act would give authority for the necessary expenditure.We think that the members should be appointed by the Prime Ministerrather than by (for example) the Minister of Labour.    This would enhancethe status and authority of the body and underline the fact that it would be concerned with wider economic questions and not with wages only.Terms of Reference and Title3. These are of first importance both on presentational andsubstantive grounds.     We suggest the following terms of reference:&quot;To assess the effects on the national economy of movements in wages and salaries, prices and profits and, having regard to the desirability of maintainingfull employment and stability in the general level ofprices, to issue statements and advice from time totime for the general guidance of all concerned&quot;.The title of the body might be&quot;The Advisory Council on Price Stability&quot;.4. In framing the draft terms of reference and the title we havehad the following considerations in mind:(a)      The Governmenfs hope in supporting the proposals is toprovide a means of educating public opinion about the implications of wage increases and of securing that considerations of the national interest involved in the settlement of wage claims are impartiallyand authoritatively presented.    Any body, however, which had orappeared to have its province limited to wages matters would be unacceptable from the beginning to trade unions.    In any eventwage claims cannot be considered in isolation from other factors.
IllIt would therefore be essential to extend its scope so as to coverat least profits and to some extent also prices.     Profits would,of course, include dividends, even though no specific referenceto these were made.    The difficulty about extensions of scope isthat questions connected with wages and prices permeate the economy, and there is a danger that the body would exercise aroving commission over the whole field of economic affairsfrom budgetary policy to foreign exchange.    Apart from the embarrassment to the Government from such excursions,so wide a scope might make the body less effective generally in relation to the main matters.    The terms of reference havebeen designed to circumscribe the scope and at the same timeto make them acceptable to other parties, but clearly muchdepends upon the good sense of the members.(b) The body would investigate the inter-relation of wages,prices and profits;   would comment on the factors which inthe past operated to increase the general level of prices;and would indicate what lessons for the future were in itsview to be learned from past experience.(c) The suggested terms of reference and the title stress the advisory nature of the body.    The Council would be inno sense an arbitration body.    The words &quot;general guidance&quot;towards the end of the terms of reference are designed tomake it clear that the Council would not intervene in or commentupon particular current wages claims or disputes.    This isan important point from the industrial relations angle.On the other hand, the Council would be entitled to deal inits commentaries with particular as well as general wage settlements after the event.(d) The phrase &quot;having regard to the desirability ofmaintaining full employment and stability in the general levelof prices&quot; is designed to establish guiding lights for the Council.It indicates that there is no point in the Council recommending severedeflation and unemployment on the one hand, or continuing inflationon the other.     Stability in the general price level should ensurecompetitiveness in export prices.    Some of us think that the reference to full employment may be unnecessary and dangerous:but most of us think that it is desirable from the point of viewof presentation.(e) The terms of reference would not specifically enable theCouncil to examine and comment on trade union structure orthe processes whereby wages are settled.    Both of these are important points.     We fear, however, that any attempt to providespecifically for these would provoke strong opposition from theTrade Unions,    It is just possible that the terms of referencecould be adjusted to include the second point specifically, butthe difficulty is that there would then be pressure to includeexamination of the processes whereby prices and profits are settled, and this would go wide and would trespass on the functionsof other bodies.    On the whole we think it would be best to leavethese points vague and hope that the Council would in practice beable to comment upon them as necessary.(f) In suggesting the title of the body we have stressed theleast provocative and most appealing side of the Council&apos;s activities.
Membership5. The Chairman would need to be a prominent figure, well-knownfor independence of mind and aptitude for the subject and for siftingconflicting evidence.    This points in the general direction of an eminentlegal figure.    He would need to be available for his dutues with someregularity, as the Councils studies will probably extend over the year,whatever the frequency of its statements, but he need not be full-time.Much the same would apply to the other members of the Council, who might be two in number;  an economist without political bias, and anindependent person of knowledge and experience of the problems involved.6. In any case we suggest that the Council should not be morethan five in number.    A small Council is much more likely to produceclear and forceful advice:  with every increase in number there is a growing danger of compromise between opposing views and of minorityreports.7. The Court of Inquiry recommended that the British Employers&apos;Confederation (B.E.C.), the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) and the nationalised industries should be associated with the body.    There are various forms which such association might take.8. The three sides of industry - the B.E.C. , the T.U.C. and the nationalised industries - might be represented by assessors of theirown choosing, who would assist the Council in its deliberations but wouldnot be members of it or bear any responsibility for its reports.    Sucha procedure would, however, involve a substantial degree of co-operation from all sides of industry and it is doubtful whether the T.U.C. at leastwould be willing to commit itself to this extent.    It would moreover bedifficult to find a single assessor who would be able to speak on behalfof all the nationalised industries.    In addition there are some doubts about the usefulness of assessors, especially as representatives of thevarious parties would no doubt need to give evidence about their views to the Council.9. Another possibility is that an employer and a trade unionistmight be members of the Council in personal capacities.     They could beappointed after consultation with the relevant bodies but would not berepresentatives.    The objection to this is that it would increase thenumbers on the Council and probably introduce partisan views.10. A third possibility is that the association of industry with theCouncil might be limited to providing evidence and information.    Indeedthis would be necessary even under the other forms of association.This is probably the least difficult form of co-operation from a T.U.C.viewpoint and would preserve the manifest impartiality and efficiency ofthe Council.   On balance, we think this solution is likely to prove themost practical.Association of Government Departments11. The Court of Inquiry suggested that the Treasury should be associated with the Council.     Other Departments are   also concerned.It is clearly desirable that the form of association between the Counciland Government Departments should not be of a kind which diminishedor appeared to diminish the independence and impartiality of the Council.On the other hand, much of the material required for the formation of viewsby the Council would have to come from Government Departments.
Departments would, therefore, have to be prepared to provide theCouncil with information, particularly statistical information.     It mightbe desirable to have nominated officers to act as general liaison betweenthe Departments and the Council for this purpose.    Representatives ofthe Departments would also have to give evidence to the Council.    Theextent to which such witnesses could properly enter into discussion of matters of opinion such as forecasts of fuxure trends would no doubt haveto be determined to some extent by experience, but we would hope thatwith safeguards against publication or quotation they could do so frankly.Secretariat and Premises12. The Council would need a full-time staff:  a secretary and astatistician, and no doubt others also.    Appropriate personnel could beseconded from Government Departments without creating the impression that the Council is in any way a Governmental organisation.Remuneration13. The members of the Council would not need to spend their full time on the work, but fees or part-time salaries might have to bepaid to some of them at least:  the Treasury is examining precedents.Fees, travelling and subsistence payments, the salaries of the secretariat, and incidental expenses, would have to be borne on a departmental Vote.    This would be the Treasury Vote if, as suggestedin paragraph 2, the members are appointed by the Prime Minister.Procedure and Reporting14. While the Council would be a standing body in the sense of having a continuous existence, it need not be in perpetual session.The frequency of meetings would be for the Council itself to determine.The Council would have no legal powers to summon witnesses or torequire the production of documents, but could, of course, invitewritten and oral evidence as it thought fit on a voluntary basis.15. We do not think any hard and fast rules need be laid downabout the frequency of the Council&apos;s reports, but it should be told that theGovernment would wish it to report as often as it saw fit and certainly not less than once a year.    The reports would clearly have to be published by the Government and laid before Parliament.     Press relations should,we think, be the responsibility of the Council itself.Some Awkward Points16. While the Council would be advisory only and might have a beneficial effect in regard to wage restraint, some of its advice may prove embarrassing to the Government and others.    The suggested termsof reference assume the desirability of stability in the general price level.     The council may comment upon Government action, which hasdirectly or indirectly increased prices, and may suggest the avoidance ofthis.    In the last resort, however, only the Government itself can decide whether in a particular set of circumstances some other aim or aimsmay have to take preference over stable prices.     Even outside the sphere of Government-controlled or Government-influenced prices, the   council might make pronouncements about prices, the level of profits or dividendpolicy which might be unwelcome and unhelpful to business and possibly
out of line with the Governmenfs current policy on these matters.But risks of this kind are inherent in the establishment of the Council.17.     Pronouncements of the Council affecting wages need not be a source of serious embarrassment to Her Majesty&apos;s Government as an employer.Both industrial and non-industrial civil servants are paid rates equivalentto those paid in similar or comparable occupations in private industryand commerce - in the case of industrials under the &quot;fair wages&quot;principle and in the case of non-industrials in accordance with therecent Royal Commission.    Thus, if private enterprise followed theadvice of the Council, the Government would do the same in relation to civil servants after private industry had done so.    If private enterprisewent beyond the advice of the Council, the Government could not andshould not attempt to impose harsher treatment on its own employees -since to do so would mean abandoning the important &quot;fair wages&quot; and&quot;fair comparisons&quot; principles.18. The Council would have no formal relationship with existingarbitration tribunals, wages councils, etc. , and it would be contrary topresent policy for the Government to ask them directly to take note ofthe Council&apos;s advice:  past experience has shown that such action hasthe opposite to the desired effect.    The publication of the Councilsreports would in any event have an effect on the thinking of other bodies,and it might be acceptable - on the recommendation of the Council - forcopies of the reports to be furnished to all members of such bodies aswell as Joint Industrial Councils and the like, for information, withoutcomment.Experience of other Countries19. We were instructed that in considering these matters weshould take into account the experience of certain other countries (notablyHolland and Sweden) which have operated or attempted to operate systems of wage settlements other than through collective bargaining as weunderstand it in the United Kingdom.    We have not in the time availablebeen able to make exhaustive examination of these:   but we note thefollowing points.    These systems appear to have had only temporaryor limited success in halting the wages-prices spiral:  moreover they are based on a degree of compulsion and Trade Union co-operation which atthis stage appears impracticable in the United Kingdom.    It would appearmore promising to work gradually towards a more &quot;controlled&quot; systemof wages settlement through an advisory Council of the kind sketchedin the foregoing paragraphs.Procedure20. It will, of course, be necessary to discuss the proposal with both sides of industry before it is finally settled and made public.     Weunderstand that the Minister of Labour is submitting a separate paper to the Cabinet about this.    It would be desirable to leave some room for manoeuvre in regard to the details of the proposal.    The final reactions of Unions and employers cannot be forecast at this stage.    A similarrecommendation by a previous Court in 1954 was ill-received by the TradeUnions.     While it may be doubtful whether this revived proposal willmeet with a better reception from them, the climate of public opinion atleast has altered somewhat since then and circumstances may, to that extent, now be more auspicious.
