(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST YTS GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 135 COPY NO.4th June, 1957CABINETCANCER OF THE LUNGMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Home Department and Lord Privy seal in May last year the Cabinet authorised the former Minister ofHealth to make a statement to the House, in which he gave an undertaking that the public should be kept informed of all relevant information on the relation of smoking and lung cancer (CM.(56) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 5).The then Lord President later asked the Medical Research Council to review the evidence on this matter and to prepare a statement of their considered assessment of the significance of present knowledge.2.     The report of the Medical Research Council has now been presented and shows that, in their view, the most reasonable interpretation of the evidence so far obtained is that the relationship is one of directcause and effect.   This is the first time that the Medical Research council have made a positive statement of this nature and they propose to issue itto the medical Press for publication on 28th June.3.     The Committee appointed by the Cabinet to recommend what policy the Government should adopt has considered a statement which theMinister of Health might make to the House on 27th June; a draft is appended.   This foreshadows the publication of the Medical research council statement and it is proposed therefore that copies of this should beavailable the same evening in the Vote Office for the information ofmembers.4.      I ask my colleagues to agree to the terms of the statement to bemade by the Minister of Health.R.A.B.Home Office, S.W.1.4th June, 1957
DRAFT statement in their Annual Report, and more particularly in their special report on tobacco smoking and cancer of the lung (which will be availablein the Vote Office at 6.0 p. m. this evening), the Medical Research council have advised the Government that the most reasonable interpretation ofthe very great increase in deaths from lung cancer in males during thepast twenty-five years is that a major part of it is caused by smokingtobacco, particularly in the form of cigarettes.   The Council point to theevidence derived from investigations in many countries in support of this conclusion, in particular to identification of several carcinogenic substancesin tobacco smoke.2.       The Government feel that it is their duty to ensure that this latestauthoritative opinion is brought effectively to public notice, so that every-one may know the risks involved in smoking.   The Government considerthat these facts should be made known to all those with responsibility for health education.   The Minister of Education included in his recently published Handbook for Teachers on Health Education advice about the dangers of smoking and he is circulating copies of this statement to localeducation authorities and education authorities generally.   corresponding action will be taken by the Scottish Education Department in Scotland.The Government now propose to bring these views to the notice of the local health authorities who are concerned under statute in the prevention ofillness and who are responsible for health education as a means ofprevention.   Local health authorities will be asked to take appropriatesteps to inform the general public and in this task they will have theassistance of the Central Councils for Health Education.3.       Once the risks are known everyone who smokes will have to measure them and make up his or her own mind, and must be relied upon as a responsible person to act as seems best.4.       The Medical Research Council are at present supporting an extensive programme of work designed to discover the way in whichtobacco smoke exerts its effect and the relative importance of other factors, such as atmospheric pollution, which may also play a part in thecausation of lung cancer.   The recent expansion of this programme hasbeen greatly assisted by a substantial grant made in 1954 by a leading group of tobacco manufacturers; on the advice of my predecessor, the presentMinister of Labour, this sum was given to the Medical Research council with complete discretion as to the choice of research projects to be supported and to the publication of results.5.       The work at present in progress consists largely of chemical andbiological studies of the many different constituents of tobacco smoke andatmospheric pollution.   In addition, surveys of the role of atmosphericpollution and of specific industrial hazards in the causation of the diseaseare being undertaken.   Work along these lines is being supported in manycentres in different parts of the country and the Council have alsoestablished as part of their own organisation three new research groups in Exeter, London and Sheffield, where long-term studies of differentaspects of the problem are being carried out.   Evey opportunity will betaken by the Medical Research Council to pursue any promising new linesof research which may become apparent.
