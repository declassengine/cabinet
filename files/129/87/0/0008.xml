Lennox-Boyd, Secretary ofState for the Colonies, about certain aspects of the constitution of the Federation.2. They reviewed the progress made by the Federation since it was established in 1953. They agreed that this progress had justified the hopes of its founders and provided a sound basis for further development of the policy of partnership between races which the Federation is pursuing.External Affairs3. The Federal Constitution provides that matters of External Affairs may,from time to time, be entrusted to the Federation. The Federal Prime Ministerrepresented that the time had come for the Federation to assume moreresponsibility in this sphere, particularly in the field of relations with othercountries, and the appointment of representatives of the Federation in such countries. The United Kingdom Government have agreed to entrust responsibilityfor external affairs to the Federal Government to the fullest extent possibleconsistent with the responsibility which Her Majesty&apos;s Government must continueto have in international law so long as the Federation is not a separate internationalentity.Direct access to the Sovereign4. In recognition of the constitutional position of the Federation, her majesty The Queen has been pleased to approve that in future the Prime Ministerof the Federation should have direct access to the Sovereign on Federal matters affecting the Sovereign personally, on the award of Honours for services to theFederation, and on a number of ceremonial matters.Administrative arrangements in the United Kingdom5. There was discussion of a proposal by the Federal Prime Minister thata separate department of the United Kingdom Government, responsible to the secretaries of State for Commonwealth Relations and the Colonies jointly, shouldhandle relations both with the Federal Government and with all three territorial governments. United Kingdom Ministers explained that this was part of thegeneral question of the responsibility of different Ministers for relations with thevarious parts of the constantly evolving Commonwealth. The whole question would have to be examined and in this examination Sir Roy Welensky&apos;s suggestion would be borne in mind.legislation. The Federal Government having represented that the Federal Legislatureshould have the power to legislate with extra-territorial effect, the United KingdomGovernment have agreed that legislation for this purpose will be introduced into parliament at Westminster at a convenient opportunity.7. The Federal Prime Minister drew attention to doubts which had arisen in regard to the purpose and effect of Article 29(7) of the Federal constitution and to the subject of legislation in the United Kingdom for the Federation.United Kingdom Ministers made it clear that the United Kingdom government recognise the existence of a convention applicable to the present stage of theconstitutional evolution of the Federation, whereby the United KingdomGovernment in practice does not initiate any legislation to amend or to repealany Federal Act or to deal with any matter included within the competence ofthe Federal Legislature, except at the request of the Federal Government.
Public Services in the Federation8. Public service questions were also considered. The United kingdom ministers said that in principle it was accepted that all Civil Services in theFederation, whether Federal or Territorial, would eventually be locally based andlook for their future to the Federal area.9. Accordingly steps would be taken to work towards this objective and inparticular the question of interchangeability of officers would be examined inconsultation with the four Governments of the Federation.Proposals for the Enlargement of the Federal Assembly and for the FederalFranchise10. The Federal Prime Minister informed United Kingdom Ministers of theposition reached in his discussions with the Prime Minister of Southern rhodesia and the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland in regard to theenlargement of the Federal Assembly and to the Federal franchise. UnitedKingdom Ministers accepted in principle proposals for the enlargement of theFederal Assembly. The Federal Prime Minister stated that he would not be ableto inform Her Majesty&apos;s Government of the Federal Government^ definite proposals for the franchise, or to present a Bill on this subject to the federal legislature, until further discussions had been held in Salisbury. Meanwhile,however, he could assure United Kingdom Ministers that a Franchise Bill wouldbe introduced and would ensure that British Protected Persons otherwise qualifiedwould not be required to change their status in order to be eligible for the Federalfranchise, and that the qualifications for that franchise would permit of a reasonablenumber of such persons acquiring the franchise. United Kingdom Ministers took note with satisfaction of these assurances.Review of the Constitution11.
