secret.(57) 142 COPY NO.22nd June, 1957CABINET-  BRITISH EVACUEES FROM egypt memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 6th June the Cabinet discussed my memorandum, C.(57) 136,on the position of the British subjects who had had their assets in Egyptsequestrated (C,C.(57) 45th Conclusions, Minute 6).Suez Contractors&apos; Employees2.        The War Office are negotiating with the contractors on the linesauthorised by the Cabinet.Grants by the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement board.        The Home Secretary has authorised the Board to make the grantsapproved by the Cabinet.Advances by Banks against Assets in this Country4.       As requested by the Cabinet, I have looked further into the legalobstacles to the release by British banks of securities which they hold tothe order of banks in Egypt for British refugees.   It is clear that thedifficulties of release flow, not from anything done by the BritishGovernment, but from the attitude which the Courts would adopt, following the House of Lords decision in the case Zivnostenska Banka NationalCorporation v. Frankman (1950 A.C.57).   The Courts in this country would uphold the right of the Egyptian Exchange Control to decide whether or not the securities should be released.   It is true that, before the suez crisis, the Egyptian Exchange Control would normally have releasedthese securities in the case of a British subject who returned from egypt to this country for permanent residence.   Now they are not prepared todo so.   The right of the Egyptian Exchange Control to determine thismatter is effective, regardless of whether the banks&apos; branches concernedin Egypt have been sequestrated.5..       There have been no developments in connection with the enquiry which the Egyptian Director-General of Exchange Control undertook to makeinto the position of releasing the securities held in London, but the Bank ofEngland are making enquiries about the position through the National Bankof Egypt.   The possibility, therefore, of the Egyptians releasing UnitedKingdom-owned securities held by -London banks remains open.
Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.21st June, 19576.        Lord Killearn has a motion in the House of Lords on 27th Junein the following terms -&quot;To draw attention to the continuing distress of Britishcitizens expelled by order of Colonel Nasser from egypt and deprived of resources held both in Egypt and in theUnited Kingdom; to urge upon Her Majeuty&apos;s Governmentthe need for decision to grant interim relief from UnitedKingdom resources to admitted claims pending a just and full final settlement; and to move for Papers.&quot;7.        By arrangement with the Commonwealth Secretary, I would propose to see Lord Killearn, possibly with Lord Salisbury andLord Lloyd, within the next few days, and certainly before the debate inthe House of Lords.   I shall outline to them what we are doing for the employees of the Suez contractors and the improvements we have made inthe grants given by the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board; and I shalloutline to them the serious disadvantages at this juncture of any generalscheme of advances against sequestrated assets ond of any scheme of advances against securities held in London.   Perhaps our colleagues will leave the Leader mf the House af Lords and myself free to decide, in thelight of that discussion, whether it is necessary to give any undertaking to explore further with the United Kingdom banks the scheme for theirmaking advances against securities held in this country.P.T.
