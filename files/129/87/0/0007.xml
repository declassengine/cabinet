THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 10730th April, 1957CABINETTHE COMMONWEALTH, THE COLONIES AND THE CUSTOMS union note by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Treaty of Rome which establishes the European Customs Union associatesthe overseas territories of the Messina Powers with it.2. I have circulated, with C. (57) 106, a report by officials recommending acourse of action with regard to the Customs Union and the Free Trade Area.The association of overseas territories with the European Customs Union createsdifficult problems of a very different order. The Colonies and the Commonwealthhave been consulted in detail on how this should be handled and a report by officials, making proposals for handling this question also, is attached. I must make it clear that, as these matters are very pressing, I have not been able to consult the Colonial Secretary before circulating this report.P. T.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,30th April, 1957.
THE FREE TRADE AREA, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC community and OVERSEAS TERRITORIESReport by OfficialsExclusion of Overseas Territories from the Free Trade area on 3rd April the Cabinet (C.C. (57) 29th Conclusions, Minute 3) endorsed the proposals that: - .(a) We should concentrate on the speedy negotiation of an Organisation for european Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) industrial free trade areaexcluding all overseas territories.ib) We should seek mitigation for damage caused to United Kingdom and united Kingdom Colonies&apos; interests by the inclusion oi overseas territories in the Treaty of Rome.(c) Ministers should do no more publicly than reserve their position on overseas territories for say two months, pending consultation with theColonies and the independent Commonwealth and pending theexpression of considered opinion in. other parts of the world towardsthe &quot; Eurafrica &quot; concept.2. Since then, consultations with the Colonies and independent commonwealth have confirmed that id) and ib) above are generally acceptable(except to a few Colonial Governments, which are mentioned below). Colonialrepresentatives have reported back to their Governments following the discussions in London between 28th March and 2nd April, and the considered views of colonial Governments are summarised in Appendix A. Broadly, the greatmajority of Colonies are content that overseas territories should be excluded fromthe free trade area provided that satisfactory mitigation can be obtained for damage resulting from the Treaty of Rome. The exceptions are Kenya, whothink that the United Kingdom should try to negotiate arrangements forassociation of overseas territories with the free trade area on the basis of theinclusion of tropical foodstuffs, Hong Kong who would like to join the free trade area, and Malta who would like to be free to decide at a later stage whether to joinor not. Jamaica, too, say they cannot decide until later. So far as Kenya and hong Kong are concerned, it would seem that they will have to be disappointedin the interests of the majority. Malta&apos;s position, as a part of Europe, is ratherspecial. Provided she were prepared to accept the full obligations of membership of the free trade area, it might be possible to negotiate her inclusion without prejudicing the general principle of excluding overseas territories, at any rate ifthe proposals for integration with the United Kingdom go through (since her position would then be analogous with that of the Channel Islands and the Isle ofMan). Certain Colonies have not yet replied, but as replies were asked for by23rd April, if the provisional views of Her Majesty&apos;s Government were not accepted, silence can be taken to indicate consent.3. The views of the independent Commonwealth countries expressed sincethe Colonial Meetings in London in general confirm their earlier opinions in favourof excluding overseas territories. The Commonwealth replies to our enquiry are summarised in Appendix B. The recent General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(G.A.T.T.) Intersessional Committee have shown that there is a considerabledegree of disquiet on commercial grounds in the rest of the world (particularly the Latin American countries) about the proposals for association of overseas territories with the European Economic Community, and the view is widely held that a waiver will be required. This strengthens our view that overseas territories should be excluded from the free trade area.4. There is a special problem regarding those French territories which aretechnically Departments of France and which are, or may be, in Customs union with France, namely Algeria, which is part of metropolitan France, and Martinique,Guadeloupe, French Guiana and Reunion. Our view is that we should seek tosecure the exclusion of these as of other overseas territories from the free trade area. We believe that this would be administratively practicable. These territories are distinguishable from Malta in that Malta is a part of Europe.  On the other
hand, it is possible that there may be considerable difficulty on constitutionalgrounds in keeping these territories, particularly Algeria, out of the free trade area.It must be recognised therefore that this is a point which we might be forced to concede in the course of negotiations. There are, we think, two main considerations to be borne in mind:  (a) So long as the free trade area does not deal with foodstuffs, the inclusionof these territories within it Would not cause any serious commercialdamage to British Colonies or to the United Kingdom: indeed, it mighton balance benefit the United Kingdom.(b) There might, however, be a danger of prejudicing the principle of excludingoverseas territories, both dependent and independent, if Algeria andthe others were admitted into the free trade area.Mitigation of Damage to United Kingdom Colonies by Association of MessinaOverseas Territories with the European Economic Community5. We have given further study to the damage to Colonial interests causedby the association of overseas territories with the European Economic Communityproposed in the Treaty of Rome, and to the methods of securing mitigation. the damage arises in respect of those commodities which are produced by both theUnited Kingdom Colonies and the French overseas territories, and in which the competitive position of United Kingdom Colonial exports to Europe would beworsened by the operation of the common tariff of the &quot; Six.&quot; This damage is concentrated on relatively few commodities, though each may be of greatimportance to individual Colonies. The most vulnerable appear to be coffee andcocoa. British Colonies&apos; prospects of developing trade in bananas and citrus fruitswith Europe would be damaged. Other products, including timber and edibleoils, may also be affected, but the extent of damage will depend on the level of the rome common tariff for these products, which has yet to be determined.6.   The possible means of mitigation for any commodity are:  (a) to seek a reduction in the level of the common tariff;(b) to obtain quotas based on the present volume of trade which would beallowed to enter duty-free or at preferential rates, or to secureassurances that the managed market in agricultural produce would notbe so operated as to restrict the entry of United Kingdom Colonialproduce.Negotiating briefs based on these alternatives and their possible combinations arenow being prepared. Our bargaining powers in negotiation will be that all the six except France have some misgivings about the Rome provisions relating to overseas territories, and that there will be a natural reluctance to shut out, or toincrease the price of imports of, tropical produce from the United KingdomColonies; also that we have a good record on liberalisation of trade betweenEurope and our Colonies, achieved without demanding contributions to develop-ment funds; that Germany and Italy have substantial trading interests in ourterritories (e.g., in the, public works field) which could be jeopardised by a sense of public grievance against the Six, and that if such a sense of grievance developed the Eurafrica concept could rebound on its authors, it is also a strong point onour side that eventually a G.A.T.T. waiver will be required for the proposals in the rome Treaty and that we can seek to secure satisfactory mitigations as the priceof that waiver. But there will inevitably be unwillingness on the part of the Sixto disturb the provisions of the Rome Treaty, or to grant what they will no doubtregard as &quot; concessions &quot; to the United Kingdom, and the negotiations cannot beexpected to be easy. We shall need in the course of these negotiations to be careful to avoid prejudicing any line which we may subsequently want to take in G.A.T.T.7. Our desire for mitigation has already been mentioned informally to theFrench, but did not meet with an encouraging response: the immediate reactionbeing that it must first be established that damage was really threatened. We must now proceed to a formal approach to the Six putting them on notice that we shallexpect mitigation for damage to the trade of our Colonies. This approach shouldbe made as soon as possible, and should be speedily followed by approaches to theindividual members of the Six who should be most susceptible to pressure, and by
joint action with other countries with similar interests (e.g. in Latin America) inthe G.A.T.T. and elsewhere. We should support the view that a waiver for theassociation of overseas territories with the European Economic Community is needed, and should seek to ensure.in consultation with other members of G.A.T.T.that it is granted only on satisfactory terms.Mitigation of Damage to United Kingdom by Association of Messina overseas territories with the European Economic Community8. The damage to the interests of the United Kingdom itself is likely to be largely through the frustration of potential increases in exports to the Messinaoverseas territories, existing exports not being a significant proportion of our total exports. Such damage as there is will arise from both the tariff and the quotaprovisions of the Rome Treaty. Mitigation would have to take the form of adjusting these provisions. Such adjustments would need to be sought throughG.A.T.T. and to be available to all members of G.A.T.T.9. This is much less significant for the United Kingdom than the mitigationof damage to British Colonial exports, and it would be difficult for us to take theinitiative in raising it in G.A.T.T. But if other members of G.A.T.T. are able toraise the question of mitigating damage to G.A.T.T. members generally arisingfrom the association of overseas territories with the European economic community, we should give them full support.Next Steps10. Ministers will wish to make public statements before long on the government&apos;s policy regarding overseas territories and the free trade area. Itwould, however, ease the negotiations with the Six both on securing agreement tothe exclusion of overseas territories from the free trade area and on the questionof mitigation, if we could first inform them of the policy. There is reason to believethat the French, having successfully negotiated the association of overseas territories with the Customs Union, would be prepared to accept their exclusion from the free trade area. If so, the other Five are likely to fall into line. There areadvantages therefore in deferring any statement in the United Kingdom for a week or so, if public and Parliamentary pressure can be withstood, until we have consulted the French and the rest of the Six.Recommendations11.   It is recommended that:  (a) Ministers should now endorse, in the light of recent consultations with theColonies and the independent Commonwealth, their earlier view thatoverseas territories should be excluded from the free trade area, andshould approve the immediate opening of negotiations for:  (i) the exclusion of all overseas territories proper (except possibly: Malta) from the free trade area;(ii) the exclusion, as overseas territories, of Algeria and the overseas departments of France, if possible, recognising, however, that inview of those territories&apos; special constitutional relationship with france their inclusion might have to be accepted, provided thatthe principles of excluding overseas territories was notprejudiced;(in) mitigation of damage to United Kingdom Colonies&apos; interestscaused by the Treaty of Rome, taking account of the possibilityof using the machinery of G.A.T.T. for this purpose.(b) We should inform the French, and subsequently the other Messina Powers,of our proposal to exclude all overseas territories from the free trade area, and should if possible obtain their early agreement to thisproposal.(c) We should formally notify the Six of our intention to seek mitigation of damage to the trade of United Kingdom Colonies.(d) We should support the view that the association of overseas territories withthe European Economic Community requires a G.A.T.T. waiver, and
in collaboration with other members of G.A.T.T. take any steps opento us to secure satisfactory mitigation of damage likely to result fromthat association as a condition of granting a waiver.(e) Ministers should, when the action summarised at (b) and (c) above has beentaken, publicly announce the United Kingdom policy regardingoverseas territories in the free trade area and the European economic community.Appendix ATHE FREE TRADE AREA, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC community and OVERSEAS TERRITORIESViews of Colonial Governments on the Policy Proposed by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernmentFollowing the Meeting of Colonial Representatives held in. London from.27th March to 2nd April, the Governments of Gibraltar, Tanganyika, Uganda,Antigua, Cyprus, Zanzibar, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and the Western Pacific, have informed us, in reply to a telegram of 7th April (which asked for information by telegram by 23rd if the conclusions were not accepted), that in general they acceptthe conclusions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government that the balance of general advantage would be best served by a combination of:  (a) Negotiations with the Six for specific adjustments to mitigate damage toBritish Colonial interests caused by the association of overseas territories with the Customs Union.(b) Maintenance of-Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ present proposals for a european industrial free trade area.2. Bermuda has reiterated that she does not wish to be associated with any european Customs Union or free trade area.3.   The following Colonial Governments have made further comment:  Tanganyika. The items in the common tariff of major importance toTanganyika are in order of importance, coffee, lead concentrates, cassava (bothmeal and root), beans and peas, wattle extract, copra, timber and kapok. Oflesser importance are animal feedihgstuffs, gumarabic and mica. Maximumduty of 3 per cent, on raw sisal will not prejudice Tanganyika; the maindanger to East African sisal comes from subsidised Brazilian exports.Antigua. Stresses the importance Of safeguarding the position of sugar and cotton. - -Cyprus. If it proves impossible for the free trade area to come into existence unless the Messina overseas territories are associated with it, the option for Cyprus to join later on terms appropriate to under-developed countries must be retained. In negotiating mitigating concessions with the six, nonTtropical produce such as wines, citrus, raisins, almonds, locust beansand olive products should not be overlooked. The adverse effects on Cyprustrade expected from the Customs Union itself are more important for Cyprusthan the additional adverse effects stemming from the association of overseas territories.Zanzibar. The Protectorate depends entirely on exports of cloves, copraand copra products and the position should be watched when the common tariff rates are known. Exports of cloves to Messina Six are not large butMadagascar is main competitor in world trade. The Messina Powers take30 per cent, of copra exports of Zanzibar.Sierra Leone. Local opinion would probably expect that Sierra Leoneproduce (notably coffee and cocoa) imported into the United Kingdom wouldbe accorded similar treatment as that acqorded to overseas territories of theCustoms Union by the latter, and be free of import duty. It cannot beassumed, in the absence of consultation with the Executive Council (owing
to election period), that the Government of Sierra Leone would not wish topress for an opportunity to join a free trade area. Suggests thatHer Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs agreement to the concessions in G.A.T.T. inrespect of importation of Colonial produce into Union countries could be linked with demand for similar preferences for British Colonial produceentering the United Kingdom.Coffee and cocoa will be especially hard hit, and the preferential marginon cocoa in the United Kingdom is not enough to outweigh possible injury toSierra Leone cocoa trade with Union countries under proposed common tariff.Nigeria. In addition to coffee and cocoa, items in the Customs Uniontariffs on which Nigeria will probably wish to seek mitigation of the rateswhen known are groundnut oil, palm oil and hardwood; also columbite if therate proves to be higher than 3 per cent.4. The Governor of Hong Kong expresses the hope that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment will not be prepared to accept a situation which results indiscrimination against Hong Kong and will proceed with the free trade areaproposals only if adequate compensation can be secured for Hong Kong or, andthis is preferable from Hong Kong&apos;s point of view, if Hong Kong is admitted tothe free trade area.5. Kenya states that the interests of the Colony would be best served by theassociation of dependent territories with the free trade area on terms which would allow tropical foodstuffs from British Colonies to enter the Customs Unioncountries in Europe on the same terms as those from the Colonies of MessinaPowers, while maintaining for Kenya the present freedom to raise revenue andprotect infant industries through customs tariff. If this course is not adopted,success of Kenya drive to improve African living conditions by increasingagricultural production may well be endangered. Kenya would be glad if this possibility could be given further consideration before a final decision is taken toadopt the policy proposed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, which Kenya agrees isthe only alternative.6. Malta would like the position kept open- for her to decide at a later stagewhether to join the free trade area.7.   Jamaica is not yet ready to express a view.Appendix BVIEWS OF COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENTS ON THE ASSOCIATIONOF OVERSEAS TERRITORIES WITH THE CUSTOMS union and/OR  THE  FREE  TRADE  AREABefore Ministers had considered the question of the association of UnitedKingdom Colonial territories with the Customs Union and with the free trade area, most Commonwealth Governments had already expressed apprehensionsabout the dangers of any such association. Broadly speaking, these apprehensionswere based on their realisation of the dangers of such association to their exportsboth to the Customs Union and the free trade area, as the case might be, and alsoto any associated overseas territories, as a result of the preferential arrangements which would exist between them. Association of overseas territories with theCustoms Union and free trade area was seen, furthermore, to raise far widertechnical difficulties and more far-reaching implications for the G.A.T.T. than theCustoms Union and the free trade area themselves.At this stage no comments on this issue had been received from Ceylon andGhana, and Canada had not indicated precisely what her views were on theColonial question.Early in April Commonwealth Governments were told that the UnitedKingdom intended to proceed on the basis of negotiating in O.E.E.C. a Europeanindustrial free trade area, excluding all overseas territories, unless this policyappeared dangerous or objectionable to Commonwealth Governments.Commonwealth Governments were asked to comment before 20th April.
Specific replies ;have been received from the Governments of South Africa,India, Ghana, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and New Zealand.In brief, they are as follows:  South Africa. Because of the importance of some British overseasdependent territories as markets for Union export products, the Union would prefer to see these territories excluded from the European economic community and/or the European free trade area. The Union could not object to any form of association which complied with the G.A.T.T., butassociation of the High Commission Territories in a form which did not include the Union itself would create serious difficulties for the existing customsrelations between the Union and these territories.India. The association of the United Kingdom Colonial territories withthe European Economic Community and the free trade area would not bedesirable as likely to raise much larger issues than those connected with the integration of the free trade area scheme with the European economic community.Ghana. Has no comments to offer, but is in general agreement with theUnited Kingdom attitude.Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Can see no objection to theUnited Kingdom&apos;s continuing its attempt to negotiate in O.E.E.C. an industrialfree trade area excluding all overseas territories.New Zealand. Broadly accepts the United Kingdom&apos;s policy of working for an industrial free trade area excluding all overseas territories. Would likean opportunity to comment further in the light of discusions at the meetingof the G.A.T.T. Intersessional Committee, and suggests that the UnitedKingdom decision be deferred if possible until after these discussions.Replies have also been received from Canada and Australia which bear on thegeneral question of the association of overseas territories. By implication they accept the United Kingdom&apos;s proposed policy since they raise no objections to it.Canada has shown concern at the possible effect the association of the overseas territories of the Six with the Customs Union has on the allegiance of other less developed countries to the G.A.T.T. The Australian reply indicates that theirofficials see no objection to the United Kingdom&apos;s proposed policy, but that thisview has not yet been endorsed by Ministers.
