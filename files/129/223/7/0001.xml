1987 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY

^^^^ Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury

INTRODUCTION^^^

Our policy is t^^iPm public spending down progressively as a proportion

of national incom^J^jgr the past four years we have succeeded in

achieving this.    E^Rj|^^cluding privatisation proceeds, general government

expenditure  (the coiM^eB^ pen ding of central and local Government) has

fallen from 47 per ceWt aJfcGross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1982-83 to

44 per cent in 1986-87 ,fln* there will be a further fall in this share in

1987-88 - though it will still be higher than it was in 1978-79. Our

progress over the last few years has enabled us to combine a steady but

controlled growth of public expenditure in real terms with a reduction in

borrowing and,  in each of the lasl^^ive Budgets, a reduction in taxes.

This restraint in public spendiAdBms made possible the strong performance

of the economy which the Chance^J^J^as described in his memorandum

(C(87) 13). W**

2. In our Election Manifesto we pl geM ourselves to continue the policy

of ensuring that public spending take^fc^^^adily smaller share of our

national  income.    This  is essential if^B^^e both to maintain the

momentum of our economic performance and^Fc^d^l iver our Manifesto pledge

to reduce the burden of taxation.

3. For this year&apos;s Survey we have set basel^re^otals  for spending of

 154.2 billion in 1988-89,   161.5 billion in 1989-90 and  165.5 billion in

1990-91.    For the first two years this was done by retaining the planning

totals set out in last year&apos;s Public Expenditure White Paper and for the

third year we have used an uplift factor of 2i per cent.

4. Departments were then asked to review their progwMws. within their

baseline figures and to put proposals  to me where they^B|^^Lafter a

review of priorities,  that additional resources were red^i^^^   In my

minute of 17 July to the Prime Minister,  I summarised the^M^^received

from Departments. ^W^W

OBJECTIVES FOR THE SURVEY

5. I have to make it clear to colleagues that bids on this sca^^r^kfar

beyond what can be afforded.    If anything like this were accepted wa^^^ld


not make the further progress in reducing public spending a a proportion

of GDP we have set ourselves.    This would not only may our objectives for

^taxation unattainable,  it would also trigger a complete reappraisal of the

Pcpvernment1s financial standing in the markets,  and provide a severe

jfl^back to the economic progress we have made.    We must keep as close as

^%c%sible to the existing planning totals and must not in any circumstances

&gt;vV tne stlare  f GDP *-n tne White Paper.

6. With the time lost as a result of the Election,  it has not been

possible to analyse the bids as thoroughly as normal.    There are major

uncertainties in a number of areas which I will want to probe further, eg

the large e^imating changes for social security and the projections of

our contrAl^ralons to the European Community.    But it  is clear that to hold

to our pc^^p^Wi public  spending we will have to face up to difficult

decisions l^^^^mber of areas.    Bids will have to be significantly scaled

back and,  t^^nM^eatest extent possible, policy savings  found to offset.

DEPARTMENTAL RoV^jfkCOSTS

7. Colleagues ha^^5^^ght  increases  in their Departments&apos;  running costs

implying overall ca^Rflfereases of 8 per cent for 1988-89 over 1987-88

with further increasa^ i later years.    The associated manpower

projections reverse th^Kwhward trend we have achieved,  implying a 15,000

increase over published plans for 1988-89.    Increases on this scale are

clearly unacceptable.

8. In the last few years,  the increases in spending on departmental

costs agreed for each first Suw^^ear have exceeded our aims.    In many

cases the figures for the later years have not been set at realistic

levels and as a result have had^5^B^.ncreased further in later Surveys.

We need to agree a realistic me tho^^^^planning provisions over the

Survey period so that Departments ha^^^kreasonably reliable basis for

making medium-term plans to improve ^ ^^ency.

9. My proposals,  set out more  fully lr^^K^nnex,  are that:

i. The running costs share of total%tob^c spending should not rise

over the Survey period.    This implies th^^^^inning costs would grow

on average in line with our plans for piJDlic expenditure generally,

ie by about 1 per cent a year in real terms, though individual

Departments would, of course, have no entitlement to such an

increase.

ii. Cost and other pressures will need to be m mSa large extent

by efficiency gains of at least  li per cent a ye38Pydfcthe use of all

resources including manpower.    These will need to be planned well in

advance and Departments should have contingency pia^^^^larger

improvements in case they are necessary.

iii. Departments should prepare management plans to delW^Bfhese

gains over the full Survey period.    In any case where the^j^B^are

not  suitably ambitious, or are unrealistic,  I would hold o^^^^k

agreement on the later Survey years until the next Survey. ^

iv. For 1988-89, the aim should be to reduce the overall increase in

provision sought by at least half.

Nationalised industries

P^Wk In the 1987 Investment and Financing Review,  the nationalised

^fcnd^ktries&apos;  own initial and unamended bids, made in May,  exceed the

b^Wkie by  0.9 billion in the first year and  1.2 billion in the two

subsequent years.    These bids are clearly unrealistic and cannot be

afforded.    They now need to be scrutinised rigorously,  and a number of

industries are revising their proposals so that we will have a sounder

basis  for judging them.    Apart from the electricity industries in England

and Wales ^&gt;tf^j-n Scotland,  I propose that our aim should be to reduce the

provis ion m lt^s t to baseline and,  where we can in the case of individual

industries^Wj^^it.    Failure to achieve this would mean greater pressure

on departmern^3kmogrammes.    There are particular problems relating to the

electricity iim^^^k this year, notably the need to set new financial

targets,  the imW^c^y^ons of privatisation and assessment of a new power

station programme^^^^kwithstanding these uncertainties,  the pressure on

public expenditure J^^5^that  it is essential to appraise the industries&apos;

bids critically and^S^Bfct challenging financial targets.

LOCAL AUTHORITY RELEVWj^^LIC EXPENDITURE

11. It has been agreed in the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic

Strategy,  Sub-Committee on Local Authority Expenditure that provision for

relevant public expenditure in England should be set at  27,969 million

( 27,538 million for relevant cur^^ expenditure and  431 million for

Rate Fund Contributions to Hous JB^Mpvenue Accounts).    This  is an increase

of  819 million above the White PlR|^^^seline.    Aggregate Exchequer Grant

in England is  to be set at  13,775^LSt&gt;Mon,  an increase of  750 million

(5-V4 per cent) on the 1987-88 settWM^^f igure including teachers&apos; pay.

I have reached agreement on the settl^jgn^^for Wales and discussions

on Scotland are continuing.    But it is^Bfl^^^ that,  for Great Britain as a

whole,  the increase in provision for loc^^WR^ority relevant public

expenditure will be around  1 billion ove^^^^trevious plans.    This is a

substantial addition and we must recognise^WP^Lt will severely limit

what can be made available for other programme^^^

CONCLUSIONS

12. I ask Cabinet -

1. To reaffirm the Manifesto policy of ensuringApBm public

spending takes a steadily smaller share of our na^Jkajk income; and

to agree that the level of public expenditure is he^^^H^close as

possible to the existing planning totals and that itlkSgfca of

national  income does not exceed the path in last year&apos; mVlhmie Paper.

2. To note that to secure the policy objective at i.  bi^JJjU. have

to be substantially cut back and difficult decisions will l^k^ko be

faced in a number of policy areas. ^^^^W

3


3.      To agree that we should aim to hold the external financing

limits of the nationalised industries other than electricity at least

to baseline and possibly below; and that we should seek to keep the

^   electricity industries&apos; external finance as low as possible.

A, For running costs, to agree the proposals set out in paragraph 9

and in the Annex.

5. To agree that I should now conduct bilaterals with colleagues on

their spending programmes.

Treasury Chambers

21 July 1987


1987 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY:    DEPARTMENTAL RUNNING COSTS

Departmental Ministers have sought increased provision for running

costs totalling  761 million for 1988-89,  956 million for 1989-90

and  1,203 million for 1990-91.

2. We cannot accept increases of this size. They would mean

that overall expenditure on running costs would rise by 8 per

cent in cash and 4 per cent in real terms between 1987-88 and

1988-89, with further real increases in the later years. They

would also imply an increase in Civil Service manpower of nearly

15,000 over the manpower plan of 583,000 for 1 April 1989 published

in this year&apos;s public expenditure White Paper and further increases

in later years, though some 5,000 of this rise stems from increases

agreed after the last Survey.

3. There are undoubted pressures on running costs. In spite

of large manpower reductions (135,000 since 1979 and 50,000 since

1983) and, in most years, Civil Service pay settlements at or

below general inflation, running costs have continued to rise

in real terms as a result of increases in non-manpower costs

(eg more buyina-in of services rather than providing them

internally) and changes in grading mix. Tight pay settlements

will continue to be the aim. But if departments are to recruit

and retain the staff they need and the Government&apos;s objective

of making the Civil Service pay structure more conducive to an

efficient service and more responsive to labour market conditions

is to be met, future pay offers cannot be expected to be immune

from pay movements in the economy generally.

4. It is thus realistic to provide for some rise in overall

spending on running costs; but the Manifesto pledge to press

ahead with management reforms to improve public services and

reduce their cost, as well as the aim of ensuring that public

expenditure takes a steadily smaller share of national income,

mean that the rise must be contained to well below the levels

sought.


5. I propose we that we should base our plans on the firm

constraint that the share of running costs in total public spending

should not rise over the Survey period. This implies that overall

running costs must grow no faster than our plans for public

expenditure generally, ie by about 1 per cent a year in real

terms. If increases in the volume of activity are to be met

in some parts of the Civil Service, there must be reductions

or lower rates of growth in others where demand is less or of

lower priority.

6. To achieve this overall objective, colleagues&apos; running costs

bids will need to be substantially scaled down, to less than

half the additions to baseline that have been sought for 1988-89;

and all departments will need firm plans to offset pay bill and

other cost pressures through sustained and incremental efficiency

gains. The improved budgetary and management systems stemming

from the financial management drive of recent years, the

Government&apos;s large and continuing investment in new technology,

and further improvements in purchasing as as well as the continuing

processes of scrutiny and inspection must be used to deliver

further improvement in performance, benefiting both input costs

and outputs^. On the input side, further improvements in the

use of manpower and better control of non-manpower costs will

be essential.

7. These efficiency gains will be easier to make on the necessary

scale if they are planned well in advance; and if the plans

are ambitious there will be greater scope for flexibility in

future years. I propose that all departments should now prepare

or revise management plans committing them, over the Survey period,

to the delivery of defined and wherever possible measured

improvements in outputs, and progressive overall efficiency gains

of at least 1*$ per cent a year, with contingency plans for larger

improvements in case they are necessary. This is a reasonable

minimum target for well managed service organisations. These

plans will be especially important for departments with large

executive operations.

8. Departments&apos; plans, and their implications for restraining

growth   in   running   costs   would   be   discussed   in   the bilaterals.

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

Agreement to increases over baseline, particularly for the later

years, would be withheld until plans for efficiency qains of

at least 1&gt;* Der cent a year were demonc -rai-od m a departmental

management plan. departments would be expected to deliver tnese

plans.

Civil Service manpower

9. Earlier this year it was announced that manpower targets

would not be set after 1 April 1988, and pressure on Civil Service

numbers would be maintained through running costs. The proposed

approach to running costs will mean large reductions in the

manpower projections of some departments. It is important to

show that the running costs regime is an effective control on

all Civil Service resources, including manpower. There will

otherwise be pressure to reintroduce manpower targets.

Conclusions

10. I invite Cabinet to agree that:

i. the objective should be to restrain running costs

over the Survey period to their present share in total public

spending by offsetting so far as possible any real rises

in pay and other costs through efficiency gains;

ii. departments should prepare or revise three-year

management plans for sustained output and cost improvement,

for discussion in the bilaterals;

iii. for 1988-89 the aim should be a reduction by at least

half of the  761 million additional provision sought in

order to keep the overall increase in running costs in line

with the medium-term objective in (i) above.
