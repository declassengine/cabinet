&lt;^^^ EDUCATION POLICY

Meri^andum by the Secretary of State for Education and Science

Colleagues know th^t the Department of Education and Science is now

preparing instryfaf&quot;r ps for drafting a large Education Bill to be

introduced in tin^a^Pa^mn.    Collective agreement has already been secured

for many of its pr/wTMons including the national curriculum and

compulsory f inane vq^^&amp;fe gat ion to schools.

2. In order that th^M*$rftwmay continue through the Election campaign I

seek authority from Cat^retvto prepare legislation on three more proposals

for which formal clearance^^^k not yet been secured.

OPTING OUT

3. We have decided to incluNhsHarjOthe Manifesto proposals to enable

schools to opt out of managemerf^yw^ocal Education Authorities (LEAs) and

become direct grant schools fund^p^umater a contract with central

government.    My aim is to establisb^r^bstantial minority of schools  in a

new sector outside local government c^jpfrol by the end of the next

Parliament.    From the outset the sch^rjg^rtyuld be open to all maintained

secondary schools and the 2,000 primary &gt;6 hrfo&gt;ls with 300 pupils or more -

with possibilities of extension to smafl^^primary schools later.

4. The main features of my proposals which will require legislation are

a. Opted out schools would be substantiitlyvBelf-managed; they

would own their own premises; employ theirNSyf^-Miaff; manage their

own finances; and control the admission of puj^^^-

b. Department of Education and Science grants w/fr^^k be paid under a

contract with each school; the provisions of theM&amp;^f^al foundation

curriculum would be applied to each school. s&apos;Ssk

c. The governing body of any maintained school wou\S_h^/^&lt;mpowered,

without prior consultation with the LEA ,  to propose tTT^^o. cease to

be maintained by the LEA and acquire direct grant statusVvjirt&gt;posals

would be subject to a statutory process including local o^^^^pns.


d. The funding arrangements would be based on local per capita

formulae approved by the Secretary of State such that opted out

\ schools were not penalised in terms of resources compared with other

&apos;s\      similar schools remaining under LEA control in the area.

e. Subject to further detailed consideration, the funding

f/^^arrangements will ensure financial neutrality between central and

^^Ytocal taxpayer;    we intended to secure that where a school opts out

v^fhXa particular authority&apos;s area, that local authority&apos;s grant and

.aggregate exchequer grant should be reduced by the actual expenditure

^rr^*Sfe school.

5. Th&amp;^&apos;proposals will secure an end of the local authority monopoly of

school eolation outside the independent sector.    They will increase

parental choice; bring about a wide measure of autonomy for schools; and

create the necessary spur of competition to jack up standards both in the

LEA schools and/ ENse with the enterprise to opt out.

MAINTAINED FURTHS^fiJiCATION:    FINANCING, GOVERNANCE AND LAW

6. My proposals r-o^Sinancial delegation to schools and for reforming

the management and ttnpj&amp;Lof polytechnics and Higher Education (HE)

colleges have alreadyC^erftVannounced.    Legislation to reform school

governing bodies was passVd^ast year.    Parallel reforms are needed in

those Further Education ^^^^olleges which will remain with LEAs. I

should like to announce tl^^e/Immediately after the Election, and

meanwhile to set drafting riv-^rafKJL

7. Maintained FE colleges st * k|(y be given at least as much financial

discretion as schools.    I propose*^&lt;i&lt;?v with the schools,  to require LEAs to

draw up and submit for approval Vch^m^s for delegating extensive financial

powers to their colleges.    The woi&lt;Irof^olleges is more complex than that

of schools, and the formula for calw^i-wg their budgets would have to

reflect that.    But otherwise I envis^rg^^riat the powers and

responsibilities of college governing yb&amp;yes should be broadly similar to

those we have agreed for schools. \C

8. Reforms are needed in the composition and role of FE governing

bodies.    School governing bodies are being reformed under the 1986 Act,

and our plans for reforming the governing bodi/Jr&quot;&quot;c!w polytechhTcs and HE

colleges have been announced.    FE governing bo foas^ ^ed to i&gt;e brought into

line and made more independent and effective.    I /wfopwse that they should

generally have 26 members,  12 of them from businexg^ap&lt;ft the professions.

LEA nominees should be limited to 5 and not take th^m/la^r.

9. These reforms would entail legislation.    But FE h^VanVinsecure legal

basis.   A 1982 study concluded that, because of changes sj^xjjex. 1944, much

existing FE provision was ultra vires.    The law needed tq/fJeybdated to

take account of developments in,  for example, the youth se^v- fi -&apos;\and

provision for those with special educational needs.    Introdu&lt; *Ag^pajor

reforms in FE without amending the underpinning legislation w^oM^be to

build on sand.    The proposed Bill gives an opportunity to upda^yTJ^Law

and remove anomalies in a way that would be widely welcomed.      LyS \\


BOGUS DEGREES

^10.    Lastly I propose legislation to restrain the activities of bogus

.^fregree operators.    My objective is to act to protect the good name of

/VB^itish higher education;    those who sell worthless &quot;degrees&quot; - mainly to

^J5  ne igners - bring our university system into disrepute.    I propose to do

^/spLkQ^ way which does not involve my Department in the staff-consuming

tksicJk\ accrediting degree-awarding bodies.

11. ./^(^Legislation I propose would -

a ./A/describe the kinds of United Kingdom degree which I regard as

gertmne degrees, by virtue of being awarded by institutions in the

Unired Kingdom authorised by Royal Charter or Act of Parliament;

b. require a prescribed form of words on certificates,

advert isem^R-t^v stationery and other promotional material, to

establish( hal(/other &quot;degrees&quot; were not genuine in the sense of a.

above;

c. impose peTp^Ci/es for breaches of the law.

Subject to further diM&amp;s^^ns with the Departments concerned, 1 propose

that the existing local alJj&gt;K&gt;rity arrangements for consumer protection

should be extended to enroforothe proposed provision.    I hope that the

Secretaries of State for S\j ot^And and Northern Ireland will support my

proposals so that they wil p-fia^eoe f f ec t throughout the United Kingdom.

RECOMMENDATION C^Co

12.    I seek authority to commissYor^ycyjk on the above legislative

proposals subject to final clearance J^P the details by the appropriate
